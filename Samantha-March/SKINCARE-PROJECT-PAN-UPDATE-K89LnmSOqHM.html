today's video is going to be my check-in
video I am doing a project pan right now
for skincare with my friend Lisa
Stevenson so this video is awesome
collab with Lisa her Channel and video
will be linked in my description box we
teamed up to do a skincare project pan
last month we started out I'll leave our
intro videos in the description box as
well we each chose 10 different skincare
items we wanted to finish up between
November 20th and January 20th and so
today's video is going to be our
one-month check-in I'll let you know
about all-time products wearing out with
them and all of that good stuff so make
sure to check out Lisa's channel it's
down below of course and our intro
videos if you haven't seen those and if
you want to see where I'm doing with my
very first ever project pan why don't we
go ahead and get started so first up
I'll talk about the product that I
finished the one product that I have
finished not doing well Samantha the
product that I finished up was the eye
cream that I chose and this is the
kodály i think it's just called the eye
cream I had a little sample guy of it
and I creams are something that I just
don't miss in my skincare routine I
apply the morning and evening I never
forget to travel with an eye cream they
are just my favorite I finished this up
probably last week I think it was so
like just under the one-month mark I
finished up the eye cream I really do
like this eye cream it was kind of like
my favorite to always take traveling
with me this was just kind of the wine I
gravitated towards I'm really glad that
I finished it up but I'm super
disappointed that this was the only one
I did I'll talk about the next two that
I'm really really close like having to
like really squeeze the bottle to get
the products out but one thing that I
noticed doing the project pan if you
watched my intro video I talked about
how I'm the person who I really like
products and I like using products up
but at the same time
I don't like to and when I get to a
certain point where I feel like I'm
almost out of a product I stop using it
unless I can like replace it or
something like that
and it's not just with skincare it's not
just with makeup but it also is with my
food like it's just something super
weird about me I don't know what it is
but it was so funny because so many
people comment it and said
you guys were the exact same way so I
felt a lot better about myself because
once I realized it I was like is it too
late to back out of this project pan
because I'm kind of embarrassed I have
to admit that but one thing that I
realized is that there were so many
products that I was like you know three
more uses five more uses and they will
be gone no no no no because I've been
using pretty much solely these ten
products for the past month there's like
you know every so often I'll do you know
a mask or you know things like that that
I don't have included in here but it has
been a majority of these ten products
for the past thirty days probably a
little bit over thirty days because I
think I started using them like a couple
days before the videos went live and
I've only finished one product so like
mind blown so now I know for the future
when I think I only have a few uses left
no girl you probably got like two more
months left of daily use of those
products so I thought that was pretty
crazy but yeah so far only the eye cream
I have finished up so a couple of
products though that I know I'm really
really close on this one is one of the
cleansers I chose this is from fresh
it's the soy face cleanser this is one
where I can squeeze it out and then I
have to like shake shake shake and then
squeeze a little bit more out and I've
had to do that I think the last like two
or three times that I've used this
product so it is perfect or much Oh like
I mean it feels like it's empty but if I
just shake it a little bit I can get
some more product out but I'm fairly
sure that I'm now saying it only has a
few uses left but I'm pretty but who
knows who knows but I'm almost done with
this one and I've actually already
gotten another one of these these are of
sample sizes I picked out a sample bag
from Sephora when I purchased during
like Black Friday they had big old
sample bags and I chose one that had
this in it cuz I really do like the
cleanser I really do and then the other
one that I feel like is just about gone
is the exfoliator I chose this at the
Kate Somerville exfoli Kate this is what
it looks like and the last time I used
it I had to like you know grip the whole
thing and shake it really hard and
squeeze it out so I don't know I mean
now I'm now that I know I'm really bad
at guessing I'm gonna use this I of love
I would say maybe 2 or 3 I'd really only
use this like once a week and that's why
I chose it even though it was a sample
size because I can't use it
like I can a lot of these other products
because it is a very intense exfoliator
and I do have more sensitive skin it's
really nice I like the way it makes my
skin feel and I think having it in my
skincare routine at least once a week is
doing nice things for my skin but it's a
little too much to do it multiple times
but fairly sure Realms done with this
guy product that I feel like I'm doing
pretty well on but I feel like I got a
lot of use out of this one this is the
number 7 protect and perfect intense
advanced a serum so I had marked last
time where I was starting I'm starting
right here and I'm all the way down to
right here I really really like this
serum a lot of times I use it morning
and evening and I just I really love
number seven and I know that they're
very well known for their serums
particularly so I really do enjoy this
one and I feel like I feel like I should
be able to finish this in one month
especially if I continue you know
morning and evening routine using this I
feel like I would be able to finish it
up and then one of the cleansers I have
that is just about done I'm having a
harder time pumping it this is from a
clean and clear it's the morning first a
facial cleanser this is what it looks
like and then again this is where I
started last month and this is where I
am now and it is a pump and I'm finding
it harder and harder because I use this
in the mornings I'm finding it harder
and harder instead of just being able to
do one pump like I normally would I kind
of have to pump it a few times to get
the right amount onto my hands so I feel
like this is another one that hopefully
I should have finished by next month but
we shall see two more cleansers that I
chose this one I feel like I'm doing
really good on as well this is from
Pacifica it's the seafoam complete face
wash a lot of times if I am doing a
double cleanse I come in with this one
first because it says it also removes
makeup and cleanses and tones so what
I'll do is typically take some sort of
like cleansing oil or makeup wipe I'll
remove my makeup but a lot of times I
find especially with certain makeup
removers it's not getting quite all of
it so then I'll use this as a cleanser
but also to take the rest of my makeup
off and then I'll come in with another
cleanser took glue the what I'm going to
talk about next or the fresh one and I
feel like that's doing a really good job
making sure my skin is you know
completely free of makeup cuz like the
worst thing to do is sleep in your
makeup that's no good for you at all but
I started kind of faded away but I
started right here a month ago and I'm
down right here and I feel like this is
it's not one yet where I have to shake
it and to get more out but I feel like
I'm about to get to that point so I feel
like I'm doing pretty good on this guy
should be able to finish it as long as
they keep using it every night but have
another cleanser here which means I had
four cleansers and I did say in the
intro video I was like I don't know if
that's too much like if I'm overdoing it
in one section I'm this is my first
project pan effort so I just wasn't
really sure but I knew I had a sample in
there as well a sample size of the fresh
one and cleansing is something that I do
typically morning and evening so I was
like a hundred oh maybe I can get away
with it but I can tell I've really been
focusing on the other three that you
know I started with less because it'd be
easier to finish them up and this was
one of my newest cleansers but this was
one that was a part of my daily skincare
routine prior to me doing the project
pan and I wanted to keep it included for
that reason I did have a pretty bad
break out a couple weeks into the
project pan and I wasn't sure if maybe
it was because I switched up my skincare
routine so drastically typically I have
a pretty solid routine and I just kind
of rotate one or two products at a time
as I finished something up or I decide I
liked something better or really since
that doesn't work for me or what not I
don't think I've ever really completely
overhauled my skincare routine like I
did with a project pan so I wasn't sure
if that's where my breakouts for coming
from because I don't typically deal with
a lot of acne or a lot of breakouts so I
was kind of like taken off-guard by what
was happening and I wasn't sure if maybe
that was it I did also try a new brand
of sheet masks throughout the month so I
was like I don't know I feel like it's
either one of those I wasn't quite sure
but this is the other cleanser that I
got this is from Dermalogica it's the
special cleansing gel and you can see I
really didn't do a whole lot of damage
throughout the month but this was the
one that was kind of like my
afterthought like oh I'm gonna use those
up so fast and then I'll still have my
Dermalogica cleanser work on didn't
quite work out that way for me but yeah
this is one I did still want to keep it
in my routine because it was a part of
it before I really do enjoyed this
cleanser and I think it works really
well with my skin which my skin type is
fairly normal sometimes in the winter I
get a little bit on the dry side but
typically
normal I'm not acne pron and I do have
sensitive skin stuff that's a little bit
about my skin type and where I'm at with
the Dermalogica cleanser then last up
are like my moisturizers and a sleeping
creams of this a moisturizer is a bout
gone again it feels completely empty but
I am still getting a little bit out this
is the Garnier skin active ultralift
miracle wake up cream this is what it
looks like and this is where I start it
and this is like about where I am that's
mostly a guess up because when I do use
it it has a pump and I have to pump like
three or four different times to try to
get out the correct amount moisturizer
that I want so I feel like I should be
able to get this finished up within the
next month here and then the last two I
have our in jar so I'll insert a photo
of what they looked like when I started
at the first month since there's really
no good way to gauge them but I don't
know if you could be able to tell I'm
just filming with natural light today
but this is what the first moisturizer
looks like and this is from botanics
that's the hydrating day cream this is
what I use when I really need like a ton
of hydration this one is really good for
hydrating but this one is like a thicker
day cream as well and just as like when
I'm feeling super super dry this is the
one that I'm reaching for so I was kind
of going back and forth between these
two moisturizers I think I'm doing
better at the Garnier than this one but
this one also you need a tiny bit and it
goes a very long way because it is so
thick so I think of doing okay on this
one I still think it'll be challenging
to finish up just because of how little
product I need but I feel like I'm doing
a pretty good job there and then the
other one I have in the last item here
is the first aid Beauty ultra Repair
hydra firmest sleeping cream I do like
to use a sleeping cream in the evenings
so this is mostly been instead of using
a nighttime moisturizer I am using the
first aid beauty sleeping cream and I am
about out it's mostly just product that
is built up on the sides of it so I'm
kind of just taking my finger and
scraping off the side so this is another
one I think with a daily multiple use at
night or even you know four or five
nights a week I think I should be able
to finish this one up and the next month
so I feel like I'm doing pretty good on
that one but after the sleeping cream
that as other 10 products that I've been
trying out them the past month and my
project payin one month chicken again so
that's gonna be everything
