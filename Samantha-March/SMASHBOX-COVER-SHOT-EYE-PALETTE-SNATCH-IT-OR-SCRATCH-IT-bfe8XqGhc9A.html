today's video is going to be a new
snatch it or skype video I have the
snapchat or scratch it series where I
review a product and just let you guys
know my thoughts and if I think that you
should snatch it up or if I think that
you should scratch it if you're new to
my channel welcome my name is Smith of
course I post videos I aim for every
single day sometimes it's five or six
days a week but I post a lot of videos
and I just love doing it so I hope that
you will hit that subscribe button so
you're notified for my future videos I
have this natural scratch at series i
also have a will i buy up wednesday
series where i talk about a new release
and let you guys know if i will buy it
what if i will not buy it but today's
video is going to be at the snatch it or
scratch it and it's going to be on one
of the new smash box cover shot pallets
the one that I got is in soft light the
packaging gets me every time but I have
done to other videos I have done a first
impression and swatches on this palette
and I've also done a makeup tutorial on
this palette so I will leave those both
down below if you have not seen those
yet they will be in the description box
down below but why don't we go ahead and
get into my review of the Smashbox a
soft light palette ok so this toilet was
a new release from Smashbox they
released update early before cyber
monday on sephora for vib rouge members
and i decided to pick one up they came
out with seven of these cover shot
palettes go through the other palettes
in my prior video so I again we'll leave
those linked down below but they came
out with seven different palettes and
they sold out very quickly at sephora
they sold out on Cyber Monday they were
gone they did come back in stock
December second on the Smashbox website
again they sold out very quickly they
were gone just the other day I think the
day prior to me filming this Smashbox
did come out on their Instagram and said
that they will be restocking soon that's
all they said they didn't say where are
they going to come back to sephora will
they ever be it ulta are they only
coming back to the Smashbox website I
have no idea but it said that the
recycle each of the palettes were
running for twenty nine dollars each of
them have a theme to them so inside they
all look the same the one that I was
sent was soft light which is a soft
focused Sheen
type of palette they have other sort of
like a smoky eye palette and all matte
palette of old pallet that sort of thing
so each one has its own little theme
they have the eight shades inside six
smaller ones two big ones each one comes
with a mirror all of these pellets are
also in collaboration with Shay Mitchell
and believe she's an actress so they are
all in collaboration with her each one
like I said his twenty nine dollars in
each one good us come with us like fun
packaging I think each style is just in
a different color so the reason why i
said i was sent the soft light pallidus
there's just one thing that i want to
touch on is this is not the palette that
i ordered i'm not sure what happened to
this day i placed my order in sephora i
thought i was ordering the metallic
palette I got this and I'm not
completely positive Y so I mean that's
going to have a really big factor on my
review because out of all of the
palettes is this was probably the fourth
or fifth one that I would have chosen
it's just not something i really would
have chosen for myself the shades are
all very light very soft I mean exactly
what the palette says that it is but
that's not really meet like I was going
for the metallic pellet fierce foil
finished shadows so to get soft light
I'm like okay and I immediately have the
thought of you know I'll just return it
and get another one they were all sold
out everywhere I couldn't get one so I'm
like okay by the time i got this palette
by the time i got this in the mail they
were already sold out on the smashbox
website so there was nothing I could do
they say a restock is coming but I'm
like when you know what am I supposed to
do so I thought should I just returned
it and I was like you should just try it
you know maybe you'll fall in love with
it you like why just return something
when you're not going to be able to get
another palette you know you might end
up really liking it so i do want to
point that out so i don't know what
happened but it is what it is this is
one that i got i decided to try it out
so it's it's really hard for me to to
say what I'm going to say but
unfortunately for me the palette did not
work out and I'm really bummed about it
because I think if I would have been
sent a different palette I would have
been happier with it so I wish I would
have gotten my metallic palette but
that's okay these shades in here are
just too late for me
have them on my eyes right now and it
just they're just too light for me
they're pretty though like please don't
get me wrong this is a nice palette if
this is the type of I look that you're
going for if you like a softer I look if
you like more subtle I shadows this is
actually a good palate the shades are
nice they swatch okay but and they show
up okay on the eyes it's just it's just
not my personal style so that's why it's
really hard for me to do this review
because they have you no decent
pigmentation for what the shades are
there's not a lot of fallout with them
which I thought was great so like on a
whole the pellet is nice it just has to
be for you and this is not the type of
shadows that you want you are not going
to like this palette and that was me
like when I finally got to like my third
eye look using it cuz i really wanted to
give it a fair chance i was like me and
you know it's just not doing it for me I
like more now I mean it's not even let
that I like super dramatic eye looks but
I just like more oomph than what is on
my eyes so unfortunately that's why I
just was not able to vibe with this
palette really well the shades are nice
this one right here is actually kind of
like an iridescent purple and it's a
really cool shade this one right here
this very last one is a beautiful brown
Sheen and I actually have come to really
love it for my lower lash line like that
one I just really enjoy but the other
ones are just way too light like this
first one barely shows up at all the
second one just I mean it's just like an
oomph more than the first one and the
ones in the middle are nice too but it's
just it's just not enough for me and I'm
super just super disappointed about it
but I just wanted to let you guys know
if that you like the more subtle I looks
and those are the types of shadows that
you reach for I think that you would
really like this palette it is small I
mean I mean you can see it is a very
small palette but the eyeshadow pans are
not super duper tiny especially the two
bigger ones these are not super tiny you
can still get your brush in it I could
get my fingers in it just fine when I
was doing my swatches it comes with the
mirror it would be a nice travel
but if these are not the type of shadows
that you go for you're not going to like
this palette so for me and ended up to
be a scratch it which I just was super
bummed about I I was expecting to get a
different palette in the mail that I
thought I would have been much more
excited about and you know been able to
create a lot more looks with these I
just feel super limited with this
palette because you know there's like
the two shades that really don't show up
at all and then you're just limited with
what it is that you can do in the eye
looks that you can come up with so
unfortunately for me the soft light
palette from Smashbox is going to be a
scratch it I'm super bummed but I just
want to say that I don't think this is a
bad palette like I think my last
snatcher or scratch it was on the
two-faced white chocolate chip palette
and that one also had very light soft
shadows in there but like that was a bad
palette I mean I can leave that one link
down below but in my opinion that that
was not a good palate so you know just a
lot of fallout chalky shadows like I
mean this i feel like the shadows are
actually really decent in here you just
have to like this palette so i would say
that if you do still want to purchase
one of the cover shot pallets from
Smashbox just really pay attention you
know now the shadows are out go ahead
look through the swatches you know just
look up the hashtag like Smashbox
cosmetics on Instagram or something or
cover shot palette look at the swatches
look at the eyelets that people are
coming out with and just trying to make
your best informed decision on which
palette it is that you want to get what
would be best for your collection
because like I said there are seven
different palettes so there's probably
going to be a palette for you and you
know based on this one and based on the
other swatches that I've seen these
these pallets do look pretty good you
just need to make sure that you get the
right one for you so I still hope to be
able to get the metallic one um I am
actually I'm going to return this
because I tried but I'm just not gonna
use this palette it's just not for me so
I'm super bummed because like I
mentioned in my last natural scratch it
I'm not someone who turns make up a lot
I studied these eyeshadow palettes when
they released when they like pre
launched Sunday night on sephora i
stared at every single paladin it was a
little frustrating because like pure
packages weren't sent out the
collaboration
was kept very secretive not a lot of
swatches or I don't think there was any
swatches that were out so I was kind of
blindly choosing a palette and I went
with the metallic because I was like I
don't feel like I have a lot of like
foiled I shadows so that would be great
for my collection again I don't I don't
know what happened but that's my advice
is trying to see the swatches and see
that I looks and you know there's
probably tons of videos out here now
about each of the different palettes
just make sure try to make your best
informed decision on which of the seven
pals would work best for you $29 is it
is it touch expensive for what it is
that you're getting but the shades do
seem nice there is a mirror and of
course the packaging is cool and to
collaboration so it is going to be a
little bit more pricey but that is what
it is but yeah I'm just I'm super bummed
that that there was a mixup and that
this palette didn't turn out to be the
one for me for me it was a scratch it
but i hope this video is somewhat
helpful for you guys as a whole for the
smashbox cover shot palettes and
definitely not saying to scratch them
because i haven't been able to try them
or test him up for myself but i am still
hoping that maybe in the next restock i
can actually get the metallic pellets i
don't know we'll see but i wanted to
share my thoughts with you on that and
just kind of wrap it up on the smashbox
soft light palette because like i said i
will be returning it to sephora which
bums me out but I'm super curious at any
of you guys get any of the cover shot
pellets please let us know in the
comments which palette that you've got
and what you think of it because that
will you know hopefully help other
people out as well now that we know for
sure a restock is coming if Smashbox has
put out any other information about a
restock date by the time I put this
video up I will leave that linked in the
description box below like I said they
just put something on Instagram and said
restock coming soon that's it no dates
no locations anything like that but the
restock is coming i'm assuming on all
seven pellets so that is that but that
is my final video on the smashbox soft
light cover shot palette i hope that you
guys enjoyed all these videos i hope
that you're still liking my snatch it or
scratch of videos just leave me any
suggestions down the comments below of

to see a for this series i hope that you
