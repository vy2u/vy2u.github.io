today's video is going to be a like mini
eye makeup tutorial using the new smash
box cover shots palettes I have the one
in soft light so I do have a first
impressions video what swatches on this
palette I will leave it link down below
but basically Smashbox recently released
seven mini eyeshadow palettes in
collaboration with Shay Mitchell each
one has a different theme to it
they were 29 dollars a piece I got mine
at Sephora during the Cyber Monday early
sale for VIP members they were also
available on the Smashbox website they
are all sold out everywhere now I just
this morning as I'm filming Smashbox did
say on their Instagram that they will be
restocked soon so if I have a date
before this video goes live I can insert
that in here but they didn't have a date
on there it just said that they will be
restocked soon so I didn't actually want
the soft light palette I'm not sure what
happened I mentioned it my first
impressions video but I actually wanted
the metallic palette that's what I
thought I checked out with but I got the
soft light palette so it's kind of
interesting because I feel like there
are two very different palettes metallic
we're supposed to be like fierce foil
finish shadows and soft light are
supposed to be soft focus Sheen so very
different ends of the spectrum here but
I'm going to go with it so I'm going to
try it out like I said I did do the
swatches in the other video so that will
be linked down below if you want to see
all the swatches so the swatches were
definitely soft because that's the focus
of this palette but at the same time
I wasn't like underwhelmed by them
because they actually did swatch pretty
good I thought in my opinion as to
compared to the toothpaste white
chocolate chip palette that I just got
there was really like barely any
pigmentation in any of those shades they
were super chalky you tell it they were
going to have a lot of fallout and when
i swatched these like yes most of the
shades took two swatches to build them
up but two isn't super bad but the
colors were just very interesting and
they just I don't know how quite I had
to explain it but it
it's watch better than I had hoped for
when I realized I had gotten this
palette and not the palettes that I
originally intended on getting so I'm
really curious it's watched pretty
decent to me for being what this palette
is like I'm not mad that these shades
are softer type of shades because that's
what this palette is I'm just upset
because I didn't get the palette that I
wanted to get and I'm confused as to
what happened but that's okay but you
know what let's I'm gonna try to make
the best of it
you know I thought about returning it
right away and exchanging and getting a
different one and then they were sold
out Sephora and one day they were sold
out on the smashbox website by the time
I got to my computer that night so I
wasn't able to do it I tried but my best
effort I tried but it didn't work out
for me so I thought well you know just
try to make the best of it so that's why
these videos are a little bit later I
was trying to see if I would be able to
exchange this palette for the one I
actually want it but that's not gonna
happen so we're gonna try try to make
the best of it palettes are $29 and the
packaging is just a lot of fun they do
have a mirror in them as well which I
find very helpful and then they have
eight different shades in here so the
only like kind of downside to this one
and you know maybe a couple the other
ones as well is I don't feel like I
could get a complete eye look out of
this because there's no map shades and I
really do prefer to have some sort of
matte shade in there but I don't know I
was gonna grab on a matte shade but
maybe we should just go for like an
all-over shimmery soft look I don't know
should we try it this is not what I had
in mind
let's just try it let's just whatever
let's just try it and see how it goes
maybe it'll work maybe maybe it won't
but we're gonna give it a try so I have
not used these shades at all on my eyes
yet so this is like a first impression
makeup tutorial so if you want to see
what kind of look I can come up with
using the Smashbox soft light cover shop
palette please keep watching so I do
have my face makeup on and then I just
have some gimme brow from benefit
through my eyebrows okay I said it
didn't seem like these shades would have
a lot of Fallout when I was doing the
swatches so I wasn't too worried about
doing my face makeup but we'll go ahead
and put that to the test so I am first
going to pick up the second-to-last
shade right here which is
all well hello I think maybe well hello
sometimes I get sometimes they get them
backwards so don't mind me if I'm wrong
but I'm just gonna grab my morphe m4 for
one brush and then I'm going to sweep
this into the crease
like the shade I really liked it when i
swatched it as well and i figure i
typically go in with you know like a
matte brown and then transition i mean
this one does have a little bit of Sheen
to it but i mean i have done like
shimmers in my crease in the past before
just to kind of switch things up so why
not try let's just try a whole look
using this palette it's makeup there are
no rules and you can wash it off when
you're done if you don't like it say
being the first color I'm not mad at it
I think it looks nice again of course
it's a softer color but I think it looks
pretty nice and then I think I'm going
to take this third shade right here and
my morphe M 4-3-3 and I'm going to just
this along the outer V of my eye and
then kind of sweep it in
it's kind of like a Sun almost has like
a hint of like raspberry tones to it I
really liked the shade when i swatched
it though I was really wanting to
incorporate it in here I think it's
really pretty ok then I'm going to pick
up the second shade right here and my
Sigma II 54 and sweep this along just
the inner part of my lid
but this one I don't feel like this
really doing anything if you kind of
take your time and play with this one it
slowly is showing up but it's gonna take
quite a few tries so this one doesn't
quite impress me as much as the first
shoe did so slowly I mean I can I'm
starting to be able to see that it's
adding a pop of brightness into the
inner corner of my eye but it's taken me
it's taken me a while to get there but
now that I have down there I do like the
way it looks I'm going to grab my m4 for
three again no extra product and just
kind of blend everything together Oh
first impression just looking at what I
have so far it's definitely a very soft
and kind of shimmery ish I makeup look
I'm not like super blown Irate away
right now I think it looks pretty I mean
it's pretty I kind of like the all-over
sheen to be honest with you guys I'm
kind of glad I didn't go in with a matte
I kind of actually liked that I wasn't
quite sure if I would or not I'm just
gonna do some liner and I think even
maybe some lashes to give it a bit of an
oomph
but then we'll come through and do a few
more shadows like on the lower lash line
and I want to do an inner corner
highlight too so I will be right back
I'm having one of those days with lashes
where you try three times put the lashes
on and then you just have to say it
screw it and I need to move on with my
life so that's where we are right now
but I just put a little bit of like a
brown liner on top no crazy wing or
anything super dramatic and then I tried
to grab out my most like natural lashes
the Ardell soft touch lashes and
they're good for like natural days which
is what I thought I'd go for with this
look but I honestly don't really love
the lashes but that's okay
we're just going to move on so i also
put just some nude liner in my waterline
and then i'm going to go ahead and grab
this the last color right here and my
morphe 36 brush and then sweep that on
susie lower lash line
the shades definitely the deepest and
probably the most pigmented out of the
palette so I thought it would make for a
good lower lashline color because I
still always loved to smoke out the
lower lashline as much as I can
Slash's today like they look like
completely different lashes I don't know
it's frustrating what do you do what do
you do so then I'm going to grab my
morphe t8 my morphe e 18 and I'm going
to pick up some of this shade right here
because it has like a fun like
iridescent shift to it and I just really
want to see what it's going to look like
so I'm going to use this as an inner
corner highlight and just see what it
does
so I feel like that one's a pretty cool
color I don't know I don't feel like I
have anything like this in my collection
it reminds me of like a very tiny bit of
sassy grape from the Anasazi Beverly
Hills sweets cloak it but just kind of
the lighter type of purple that makes
any sore sons so that one's kind of fun
I don't know how well you can see it on
camera but it has that you're a doesn't
shift to it so that's neat I'm just
going to apply some mascara to my lower
lashes by then I just I'm to zoom you in
close real quick so you could see
finished eyelook okay so I just added a
gnar satin lip to finish off the look
but that's going to be my completed I
look using the Smashbox soft light cover
shot palette so my overall first
impressions is I'm actually not super
impressed as I was going along I was
like okay okay maybe this isn't going so
bad not going so bad cuz you know I was
a little bit hesitant about the palette
in the first place but overall once I
got done and looked at it I was like I
don't know I mean it it's I it's just
the colors are so soft I mean some of
them like the third one that I use just
really it took a lot of time to build it
up and it really didn't do a whole lot
like it kind of just looks to me like I
have a sheen across my eyelids and
that's kind of it so I mean if this is a
makeup look that you like and these are
the shades that you gravitate towards I
think you would love this palette I
truly do I can't say that I mean I don't
feel like the shades are bad there
really wasn't a lot of fall out I mean
they did swatch well they look pretty
this is just not for makeup look that I
gravitate towards myself so on a whole
like do I think this is a nice palette
yes and I used four out of the eight
shades and they were nice this
iridescent color I don't know how well
you can see it on camera but it's
actually
really cool like that's actually a
pretty fun color and that one made me
pretty excited or no I used five because
I used the last one on my lower lash
line as well and I really like that like
I like that as a lower lash line color
on days where I'm not doing like a super
bold smoked out lower lash line I want
something a little bit softer I actually
really like that color for that and even
like the third the first shade that I
placed down like kind of a light brown
sheen that was nice too I mean that
could be even something where you just
put that all over your eyelid and call a
day if you want like a super-fast look
because it's still got a little bit of
brown in it but has some sheen to it
kind of give it a little bit of a pop
but I don't know I can't say that I'm
super blown away with this one makeup
look I think I was hoping that I would
be a little bit more excited but again I
don't think it's bad and you know this
is what this palette is supposed to be
for it's supposed to be a soft focused
sheen according to Smashbox and I would
say that is what it is it's just not
what I prefer in a makeup look which was
why I was so bummed like out of all the
palettes that I could have been sent to
me incorrectly this one I was like oh
okay like I would have preferred a lot
of other pellets in front of this one
but that's you know I was like it's fine
just get over it move on just try it out
maybe you'll fall in love with it first
impression I'm not super in love with it
I do want to stress that if this is a
makeup look that you like these are the
shadows that you go for I think you
would love this palette I really do it's
just not a me palette I liked a couple
of shades that I tried in there I will
definitely try one more or two more
makeup tutorials with it before I give
my final feedback if you want to see a
censure or scratch at video just let me
know but I'm not going to throw the
talent on it yet especially because I
really love that you're a Dustin Sheen
and I really loved that last brown shade
as well so I'm gonna play with it a
little bit more and see what I think but
that was my first impression makeup
tutorial using the Smashbox off light
palette I hope that you guys enjoyed it
or found it helpful let me know what you
think did you get any of the Smashbox
palettes let me know if you
or if you're still interested in picking
one up and which one you are most
interested in I wish I would have been
sent the metallic one because I felt
like that would have been a lot of fun
but it was interesting to try out this
palette I'm glad that I was able to get
a full look and now that I did it I
think with these shades in here that you
could do a complete look I don't feel
like you would need to have that matte
shade in there I think with the shades
that are inside here you could do a
completed look and it could still look
really pretty so this is definitely very
trouble friendly it does have a nice
mirror in there as well so that's good
but that's kind of my overall first
impression makeup tutorial using this
palette again I hope that you guys
enjoyed it if you do like seeing these
types of videos please do give this a
thumbs up so that I know I hope that you
will subscribe before you go and I'll
catch you real soon in my next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
