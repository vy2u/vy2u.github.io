today's video is going to be a first
impression and swatches on a new
Smashbox I shadow palette oh yes let's
packaging is a lot of fun so this is one
of the new cover shop pallets from
Smashbox cosmetics they recently came
out with seven of these mini
travel-friendly I shadow palettes and I
was able to pick one up from Sephora so
this is I believe a spring release they
were launched early on the Sephora
website for cyber monday they're
actually launched the night before cyber
monday for vib rouge members to pick
them up and then like regular for
everybody else on cyber monday they sold
out I mean within a couple of hours they
were available as well on the Smashbox
website on December second and they sold
out again so I believe I'm saying that
correctly what I'm saying that they're a
spring release because that's what they
said on safar that was like the whole
sephora cyber monday was shop new spring
releases so they were only up for a
short period of time then they all went
away because apparently they're coming
back but I haven't been able to confirm
that via Smashbox they really didn't
have a lot of information on their
Instagram and really their website
doesn't have a lot of information either
so if I can find out more information
I'll leave that listed below but that
was my impression of these but that's
just my impression but was what I was
understanding was how the launches went
but these are also in collaboration with
Shay Mitchell she is an actress I
believe on Pretty Little Liars I don't
watch that show but I hear it's a good
show I'm not super familiar with shay
mitchell and for some reason the
collaboration was actually kept like
really secretive it wasn't I think I
just found out about the collab like I
knew it was a collaboration but for
whatever reason they weren't saying it
and it was just a few hours before the
pallets wouldn't lie about sephora that
they announced it was a shape mitchell
that did not sway my opinion in any way
i knew i wanted to get these I really
like Smashbox as a brand I have a lot of
products from them I really like the
quality of what they put out so when I
saw them I knew I wanted to get one
it wasn't sure which one and then seeing
the collaboration I didn't really care
that I mean it could have no
collaboration I would have bought one
anyways so there's that so this is what
the packaging looks like it's really
cool very like Instagram boomerang
worthy am i right and then when you open
it up it is a mini palette I mean don't
be alarmed it is very small but that is
what the inside looks like and then it
also does come with a mere so each
pallet has six shades down here and then
to larger shades up there as well so the
seven palettes that came out golden hour
was Li inspired warmth bold was
electrifying standouts smokey was mats
and shimmers for effortless drama
metallic was a fierce foil finish soft
Lloyd is soft folk of Sheen map was lush
and velvety and a blaze was bridge and
desert inspired so I have the one in
soft light and I'm going to be honest
with you guys this is not what I thought
I had ordered I don't know what happened
I wanted the metallic pallets that's the
palette I knew that I wanted that's what
i thought i had in my cart at sephora
I'm truly not sure what happened i was
looking at all the different ones and i
was trying to decide if i should get to
it just to be able to test him out more
or maybe even get one for a giveaway I
wasn't quite sure I don't know if when I
was looking at other palettes if I
accidentally clicked that was the one I
want it I I don't know what happened and
I was doing it so fast because I knew
things were going to be selling out I
was doing it so fast that I don't know
when I reviewed my order I must not have
paid close enough attention and then I
never got a confirmation email from
Sephora that's happened to me my last
three orders now I haven't got
confirmation emails from Sephora because
I always look at them so I'm a little
frustrated because I definitely would
have looked at the email and hopefully
would have caught the mistake maybe I
wouldn't have but i'm not sure what
happened this actually is not the
palette that I wanted and when my order
arrived I opened it up and was like okay
that's not what i wanted so i went back
and looked in my order and the order i
had it a soft light so i don't know my
faults but i'm a little bit worried
because i immediately thought you know I
should get a different one they were
already sold out and
on the smashbox website when I went to
see if I could exchange him there
already so that so I have soft light and
I thought about returning it right away
but I was like well now they're all sold
out I don't know when they're coming
back and stock because Smashbox having
it has been given us any information
towards that so I'm going to keep it and
hopefully I love it I was a little bit
worried because the shadows reminded me
just a little bit of the two-faced white
chocolate chip palette which I recently
got not i mean the shades maybe a little
bit but like it's supposed to be soft
focused sheen in this palette and the
two-faced shadows were definitely super
soft to the point if they didn't show up
if you haven't seen any of my videos on
the two phase two white chocolate chip
palette i'll eat them all linked down
below but I was super underwhelmed with
that palette and really disappointed in
it so I was like oh man like these look
kind of similar what am I going to think
of this palette but I haven't swatched
it yet I haven't played with it at all
that's what we're doing in this video so
it's going to be a very very very first
impression type of video so we will see
so packaging wise I mean it is very
small you can see there it is right
there and then for comparison this is
the Smashbox photo mat eyes palette and
then there is the cover shot palette so
you can see I mean it's a considerable
difference I I knew that I knew it was
going to be a mini palette these are
twenty nine dollars if I haven't even
set the price yet these are twenty nine
dollars I knew it was going to be small
and sizes are you know smaller but
they're not super tiny and I appreciate
that and you get the two larger ones
here so the inside I wasn't disappointed
when I opened it up and saw the sizes of
the shadows I truly wasn't and honestly
like yes this is small but that
packaging cool right like I am fine with
that thirty dollars i do still think in
a little bit expensive IM glad it has a
mirror about twenty nine dollars i do
think it's still a little bit on the
pricey side for what it is that you're
getting but in comparison the smashbox
photo mat eyes palette is forty nine
dollars so you know i just maybe it's
just a little bit on the pricier side
but because it is within collaboration
and the packaging is so fun I'm assuming
that's where the extra costs have come
in so that is a little bit about
packaging and then what is inside the
palette like I said I haven't swatched
anything so I'm excited to get into the
swatches they do have shade names on the
back here so that is good but why don't
we go ahead and do some swatches fingers
crossed okay so warning if you've never
seen in my videos I don't have a huge
swatch game but i'm going to try if it
doesn't work i'll insert photos but we
give it my best shot so i'm going to go
ahead and do the two big ones first so
these shades are innkeeper and
spectacles so this one is keeper and
this one is spectacle so those are those
swatches i also did just get a light so
sometimes it's hard for me to be able to
tell if i'm like doing good enough
swatches because the light can kind of
make it a little bit bright but again if
I need to I'll go ahead and insert
pictures in here so you can see the
swatches if I don't feel like they
aren't good enough but so far I mean
those are those are fun and actually the
one in spectacle it's kind of kind of
like a cool like almost like an ear
doesn't shift to it I wasn't expecting
that but that actually looks really cool
so ok I'm ok with that ok and then I'll
try the first three which is starlight
fresh take and cascade but those are
those three on my fingers these funds I
don't feel like swatch just great is the
first two but let me go ahead and swatch
okay so those are the next three
swatches and these ones there okay the
first one is like a pretty has kind of
like a peachy undertone like a very
light peach undertone the second one is
more pink and it has like the sheen to
it that was really pretty and the other
one almost has like a raspberry tinge to
it which looking at it in the palette I
wouldn't feel like it has kind of like a
raspberry look to it but those are
pretty do kind of have to build them up
a little bit which I figured with a soft
sheen pellet I get it but those are
those are pretty the first two really
got my attention the next three not
quite as much but let's go ahead and try
the last three okay so then we have the
last year over here which are aglow well
hello and beach house okay there are
those three
so then those are the last three those
are really pretty as well I actually
these last three impress me a lot i have
just okay so i just initial impression
i'm just glancing down at my arm right
now and i'm i'm not mad so the first one
is a real pretty almost like kind of let
that like mauve color mauve color with a
sheen to it and then the last who are
actually really pretty and very
pigmented i really didn't have to build
these up like the first three in the
line I kind of had to build up a little
bit but these the last two really use
needed the one swipe and they came out
really well I mean they're both Brown
shades both with the sheen to them of
course but both really pretty the second
to last one almost has like a tiny tiny
hint of red to it very very subtle again
here are the swatches on my hand I can
go ahead and insert a picture too if I
feel like a picture would be better
suited but so far those swatches were
pretty decent and again you do kind of
have to build them up a little bit and
again i would i would expect that was
having this be like the soft Shane soft
focus palette that is what I would
expect but I'm actually really impressed
with this shade right here it has like
that iridescent kind of purple look to
it and I'm excited to try that one and
actually some of these pinks in the
middle here as well excite me like this
one has a bit of a raspberry tinge to it
which I find really super interesting
these last two shades are really really
pretty so okay i'm actually not mad and
I'm super grateful for that you guys I
can't even tell you i ordered this in
the two-faced palette at the same time
and I just really got a lot of bad vibes
from the two-faced one so I've been so
so nervous I've kind of been like
delaying doing this swatch video because
I'm like what if I don't like this
pellet either and like that entire order
was just like a waste by time but so far
it's looking pretty promising with this
palette I know it might not be for
everybody but again there are six other
palettes to choose from but those are
these swatches from the Smashbox soft
light
I palette I hope that they were able to
help you out maybe if you are still
considering giving this palette when
they do come back in stock again i wish
i had more information about when
they're coming back in stock moving by
the time i get this video up smashbox
will have told us something as to what's
going on when they're coming back where
they're coming back and if they have i
will leave that in the description box
down below again it's my understanding
that these will be coming back i really
really hope that they weren't only on
safaris website and only on smash boxes
website for one day of peace and now
they're completely gone i really hope
that he'll be coming back i have a
feeling that they will be but again i
can't say that for sure but these are
twenty nine dollars a piece again there
are seven different ones to choose from
i just think this packaging is so much
fun the swatches I have to say I'm
pretty impressed with not all of them
blew me away but enough of them made me
pretty excited that i will be very
curious to get these on my eyes do you
