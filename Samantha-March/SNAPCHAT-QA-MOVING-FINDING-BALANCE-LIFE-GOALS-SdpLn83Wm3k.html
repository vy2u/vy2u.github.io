today's video is going to be my very
first snapchat Q&amp;amp;A so I have done like
UAE's in the past it usually it's like
sending in questions writing you know
questions on Instagram or tweeting them
to me I've never done a snapshot Q and I
yet so I'm really excited a little bit
nervous to see how it goes so I've asked
my snapchat to send me in questions if
you send me in video questions I will
try to play the questions as best as I
can in this video so you can see and
hear them as well I don't really know
like how far do I need a home phone are
you available to hear it am I going to
be able to hear it I don't know but
we'll try it out or if you spend in like
regular snaps or text naps I'm just
going to read the snaps and then answer
your questions so I'm really excited
I've let my snapchat know and hopefully
some questions will come in if you are
not following me yet on snapchat and you
should I am just assuming earth adapt
march i will leave my little ghosts up
here and it will also be in the
description box below if you want to
follow me go bronze snapchats I talk to
you guys every single day I talk to
everybody and I also do a lot of like
special things for my stump show family
so if you aren't in there yet I hope
that you will be but without further ado
why don't we just go ahead and hop into
the QA okay i like i like the deer
filter okay so she asked if I had to
pick a different occupations an author
what would I choose but another thing
that was actually always always
interested was like being a sports
broadcaster you know like your Erin
Andrews type I just I'm as such a huge
sports fan I also obviously like enjoy
being on camera it doesn't scare me or
anything like that and i just love
sports i'm so passionate about them and
like researching them to like I
absolutely love it or read all the
articles i watch the interviews and I
just think it would be so cool to be
able to like be in the action like
especially we're in baseball playoffs
right now and I'm a Cubs fan and I just
think of like how exciting it would be
like if that's your job as to travel
around with the teams and like in
view them after the game and the
excitement and all that like that would
be so cool question says what's it like
being an author and a youtuber that is
from ml ooh what is it like being a
youtuber and an author if you like being
an author and especially because it's
what I do full-time people are like oh
you just you know kick your feet back
and like put out books every once in a
while and there's actually so much more
that goes into it it's definitely very
stressful it's very time-consuming but
kind of like what I feel like the
hardest part of being an author is is
that you have so many people judging you
you know it's not an occupation where
you just go into your job and you know
work your regular hours and come home
and that's done like you have people
writing reviews on your books and
sometimes they are very scathing reviews
and they even like will come after you
if you know even if you put something in
the book that maybe isn't your value but
that's your characters you know belief
in values all some people are coming
after you for that and it can be very
stressful because you have all of that
outsider feedback coming in and you
really rely on your readers to keep
reading your books and keep buying your
books and otherwise it's you know pretty
hard to keep continuing your job but at
the same time even though there's a lot
of like pressure and stress that goes
into it it's just so much fun for me
because it allows me to be creative and
there's a lot of stress and a lot of
pressure that goes into being an author
it's also not exactly like a huge
money-making job if you're an indie
author like me but luckily I'm in the
position where it's what I get to
continue to do and hopefully just get
better and better at it so I feel very
very grateful that I get to do it and
then what's it like being a youtuber
definitely the same like I said like
stress and pressure because you have so
many different people that can be
watching your videos and commenting and
you know you can deal with the
negativity but at the same time being a
youtuber is also one of the best
experiences and like one of the best
decisions that I think I've made I
discussed in the past video about how I
actually started YouTube once and I
didn't feel enough confidence to keep
going and I stopped it and I am back now
and I have more confidence and its
really because of all these other people
that are
watching the videos and even like you
guys you're snap trying to make
questions right now I feel a connection
with so many different people all over
the world truly and I just think that is
such a cool experience it's also a great
outlet for creativity again as well now
I get to I get to put that creativity
into something else as well and talking
about talking about our passions of mine
which is makeup and beauty and to be
able to put it on YouTube and talk to
people who understand me and have the
same beliefs as me it's just really
honestly the coolest thing one of my
favorite things to do is turn my
passions into my paycheck so it's it's a
like a quote that I've always lived by
and it's what I try to do and it's just
something else that I'm doing with you
to bits you know I've always been
interested in makeup and beauty and
reviewing the products and talking about
them and trying them out how can I turn
that into some sort of a paycheck some
sort of you know some sort of job and
you know make it more than just a hobby
and YouTube has really been that outlet
formation is from crystal she says do
you ever want to move out of Iowa if so
where yes girl uh I would personally
love to move out of Iowa it's no offense
against iowa by any means I just I truly
never thought I would actually stay in
Iowa reason for that is I don't like
cold weather I don't like winter I hated
I get seasonal depression it's horrible
it's not any fun I went to high school
in Dubuque Iowa and then I came to Des
Moines for college I just always kind of
had it in my head that after I graduated
I would move somewhere else California
Florida somewhere warm I kind of thought
maybe I would move around with my family
my brother-in-law is in the military so
my sister and then also my mom they move
around with him wherever he goes and in
college I met my husband so I ended up
falling in love and he is someone who
really enjoys Iowa you know he's close
to his family his family isn't too far
from where we live now
des moines you know with having some
sort of family close by it it does make
sense to stay here especially for one
like if we you know have a family one
day and things like that at least we'd
have some sort of family close by
because my family really is not I really
like one hundred percent hated Iowa and
needed to get out you know a I probably
wouldn't to continued a relationship
with Mitch or married him but I also
think if I like SAT him down it was like
I'm really super unhappy here like I
want to move I think that he would move
with me I do know do I see myself
staying in Iowa the rest of my life
truly I don't know I don't know what the
future holds maybe there will be a
reason that we move someday but i don't
know i don't see it happening in the
near future but it's interesting because
i never truly expect it when I left for
college in 2005 I did not think I would
stay in Iowa so another video okay she
wanted to know which nail glue I use
awesome question so I recently actually
started to get acrylics I was kind of
like back and forth on it it wasn't sure
if I wanted to do it or not but I've
decided to get him I don't know for sure
if I am going to keep them but for right
now like what I have on the past maybe
like month or so two months maybe having
acrylics but before then what I was
using was nailed her i totally recommend
nail her i actually did like a whole
video about it because i was so so
impressed with this company and their
nail glue is like insanity so I will
leave nail her link down below and i
also have a coupon code with them I just
I'm not sure what it is right now but I
will leave that link down the
description box below what if you what
if you could only have one of these oh
wait let me screenshot Hey Oh No okay so
let me show you guys that screen shots
because it says what if you could only
have one of these only one which one
okay can you guys see that so it looks
like lipstick
animals or pizza so if I can only have
one which one it would definitely be
animals and my dog let me actually see
if I can show you guys my dog right now
because this is how interested she is in
my snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and people always want
to see her in videos but she's such a
big dog I can't I can't hold her because
she's so large but let me show you guys
so I was sitting there in front of my
super messy desk but let me just turn
turn turn Aries what are you doing do
you care about my video no that is my
dog area so she she clearly cares what
was going on she sits that's my chair
that I said in my office and you can see
how much space she takes up we share the
chair for the majority of the day she
has a cave and she has a bench in the
office but mostly she's on that chair
with me and we share and basically it
means I don't have anywhere to sit so um
definitely would have to be my dog
though I love her so much Aries is a
Beulah for anyone who was asked I know I
get a lot of questions about her visuals
aren't a super comment breed but
absolutely love them we will totally get
more vishwas they're such loving dogs
they're called velcro vizslas because
they are always like velcroed to their
owners I just my dog my dog is like
everything to me you guys like i am that
dog person i am that person this one's
another video okay so she f arrest her
my Bonnie back up but she said how hard
is it to balance youtube and writing um
there definitely is a balance and I've
recently started to kind of feel it more
as the my YouTube is growing and even
like Instagram is growing I would
definitely want to keep putting as much
time and energy and effort as I can into
it but then at the same time you know I
don't want to lose my career because
that is what being an author is to me
how i balance it is I create lists and I
create goals and I create deadlines
every single day I make a list of what I
need to get done the very first thing
that is on the
my list is either my writing goal count
do i need to you know do some items for
promotion and marketing like I focus it
on my books what is it that I need to
get done right now for my book says the
number one thing that goes on my list
the second thing that goes on my list is
stuff for my blogs or like emails or if
i'm working with any clients because i
do proofreading and editing and
marketing for authors anything that i
need to do for that sort of realm if i
need to write a book review or format a
blog post or anything like that that is
the next thing that goes on to my list
and then the third thing that will go on
to my list is do i need to film a
youtube video do i need to edit one do i
need to create an Instagram tutorial
don't need to get all my Instagram post
ready what is it that I need to do in my
social media world and that list and
those daily goals really help me out I
also create weekly goals for myself and
then I create monthly goals for myself
because those are things that you know
maybe I can't accomplish something in
one day I need a week to do it I need a
month to do it i will write down those
goals as well and work towards them that
is really what helps not only keep me
balanced but keep me focused i'm
definitely a list person i need those
lists to keep me on track and to keep me
throughout schedule on the day and you
know if you're a list person and you
need that to help keep you on track
definitely do it do it every day it
helps me so much so Danielle asked what
is your biggest pet peeve that makeup
gurus do um that's a good question you
know what I was recently just talking
with somebody about this and um you know
what actually maybe I think I have two
things yeah yeah I had two things that I
could talk about in both worth are
things that I was like recently talking
with somebody about so they're kind of
fresh in my mind and they have to do
with being on YouTube one that like I'm
finding myself getting more and more
frustrated with is is youtubers who are
just constantly doing sponsored videos I
have zero problems with sponsored videos
in general I myself have done two of
them and I've been so excited to get
them and to be able to work with brands
&amp;amp; Co
brate awesome I totally understand them
but when youtubers are only doing
sponsored videos it can get a little
strange to me actually when they start
doing sponsored videos for things that
don't seem to have anything to do with
their channel like I've seen a youtuber
who I mean serious at the beginning of
every single video even something like a
favorites video all of a sudden we have
to get the disclaimer of you know and
you have to you do have to disclaim if
your video is sponsored that's that's my
law but it's just in the beginning of
every single video it's sponsored by
this thing and this thing and that thing
is this thing it's like what why but
especially there was one where I was
like oh this app and you can play games
and I'm like you know I'm trying to
understand and you know I'm on the
websites to like famebit and that sort
of thing where you can see the proposals
out there and then you see the youtubers
doing them and it's like you know what
yeah I could have submitted for that but
it doesn't have anything to do with my
channel or who my audience is so why
would I be talking about this thing are
that thing are the singer that thing and
when you just do too many it just makes
me start to think that I don't really
know if I can believe everything that
you're saying especially when you
mention something like this is my
absolute favorite thing in the whole
wide world use my discount code use my
link dadada and then you never hear that
person talk about it again not even just
on youtube or Instagram but I followed
these people on snapchat you never hear
them speak about it except in their
sponsored videos it's like you start to
lose the trust and I think that's a
really big thing and it's something to
that you know as I'm starting my youtube
journey that I'm keeping in the back of
my mind is you know don't I don't ever
want to lose trust with people I think
that's such a huge thing and I've seen
it firsthand myself that I've lost trust
and other youtubers because too many
sponsored videos and I mean you know say
they post seven videos a week six videos
or sponsored and it's like ah I don't
know and then especially when you're
talking about things that doesn't make
sense to your channel your audience and
you never talk about him ever again and
makes me lose the trust so that's
definitely something that that is
interesting to me another one that is
just hiding in my
about this because I was getting so
frustrated video popped up on my you
know to watch list from from a channel
that I was subscribed to and this person
like the name of video with something
like I'm quitting YouTube or something
like that just quitting YouTube my last
youtube video something along those
lines and you know the thumbnail was
like a really sad like you put your leg
on how this is my last youtube video i
don't like oh my gosh I can't believe
this what the heck and I immediately I'm
at a friend's house and I click on the
video right away I can't believe this
person is staffing YouTube and it
actually had absolutely nothing to do
that it was like a kind of like a
snapchat QA and one person mentioned you
know are you going to stop doing YouTube
and you know they were like oh no never
how about we love you too ba ba and
moved on and now to me that's like click
bait and I don't appreciate click bait I
don't like being duped into watching a
video that actually has nothing to do
with your thumbnail or what the title is
I think it's duping your audience and I
don't appreciate it I was upset I am
subscribed I was mad it's actually
happened to me before with other
youtubers as well have done the same
thing I'm quitting YouTube this is my
last youtube video I'm whatever whatever
whatever and the video is not on that
really doesn't even have anything to do
with that and I've seen it for other
things too you know like the thumbnails
and the titles of videos just try to
bring you in and you know are something
else content wise and I think that's
really crappy because I was a viewer of
YouTube first before I started making
videos and those are the types of things
that like make me angry as a subscriber
so again it's another thing to keep in
the back of my mind of you know making
sure that my thumbnails and my titles
match with the content that I'm putting
out and I'm not trying to like dupe
anybody to click on my video just for
clicks and for views and things like
that so let's give a question that's two
things I don't know does anyone agree
with me on that I'm just curious I'm
just curious those are just my feelings
in another video if you could ask me on
how much money you're making Parsons
worth what would it be
okay I think she said what was it she
wants to know how much eye makeup
collection is worth money wise was that
okay I think that's what was being asked
how much my makeup collection is oh I
don't I don't even know if I want to
think about that because that's probably
like a haunting number but I mean oh you
know some of the makeup but i have my
collection I've had for years like I
don't that is a tough question I mean
and I don't even think I have a big
makeup collection I've recently started
doing YouTube videos on my makeup
collection but I'm kind of like breaking
it down into sections cuz I don't feel
in my opinion that I have a huge
collection like other people on YouTube
but you know it's still you know some of
these items I have had for years
especially if we include things like
makeup brushes type of thing but I mean
it's got to be somewhere in the
thousands which is which is really weird
to think about that's that's weird to
think about ok I think we're nearing the
end because the Sun is starting to go
down so I'm gonna get like some weird
shadows pretty soon but look keep it
rollin ok so she said she said what are
my life goals and she said I apologize
for looking awful this clip not feeling
good today you're crazy girl ok so what
are my life goals oh well that's such a
loaded question um definitely a you know
major goal of mine is to just keep
improving and keep getting better and
keep doing what I love and you know keep
getting better at doing what I love if
that makes any sort of sense but I just
feel like there was a time in my life
where I was so unhappy and I wasn't
doing things that I wanted to do and it
just kind of trickled into my everyday
and once I kind of figured out my path
and what it is that I wanted to be doing
and what make me happy
I really worked hard on achieving it it
just made my life truly so much better
and so much happier I kind of touched on
that subject in my why I really started
my youtube channel video I can leave it
link down below but really it's just you
seen too many people you know I see too
many people in my personal life who are
unhappy with you know their job or with
something else in their life and it you
know just translates into every other
aspect of their life and it's just hard
for them to get happy so I just really
think that you know what it is that you
do for you know your career and such has
such a big impact on you I know it's not
always easy to get there it definitely
wasn't easy for me to get to this point
at all like I kind of mentioned earlier
of you know going to my regular jobs and
it's at some point I was working three
jobs at one time just to be able to pay
for everything but was doing something
on the side to kind of help get me to
where I am today so that's always big
life goal is to just keep chasing after
what it is that makes me happy too you
know to find my happiness I really hope
you guys can hear these cuz i don't i
just really open ok that was from sarah
she said what is my favorite movie my
favorite movie I feel like I'm gonna
have to go with clueless I just love
glueless I could still marks close to
this day be able to speak the lines of
what them that was a movie I was so
obsessed with back in the day I had like
a clueless computer game or you had like
shares closet I would act out clueless
in the living room like I bought the
pens like they had in clueless like the
feathers on the end like I was so so
obsessed with that movie so I'm gonna
run it down here I see that I have a
couple left and then well we do have
this was so much fun okay so this one
says if you could only use one makeup
brand for the rest of your life what
would it be that's from something catchy
then he'd only use one makeup brand for
the rest of my life what would it be why
are these questions so hard it's like
the first one that I want to say is
Maybelline because I use Maybelline so
much for facebook
onyx I have a ton of Maybelline
foundations concealers even like setting
powder like I just have a lot from
Maybelline even like their eye liners
but I'm not like huge on their
eyeshadows so it's like could I make it
work with Maybelline really just over
here thinking cuz it's so hard because
some brands don't have you know a whole
line out yet so I don't know I guess for
right now I'm gonna have to go with
Maybelline just because I think the face
is like most most important in my
opinion and I feel like I could make it
work they do like Maybelline eye liners
and they have colored eye liners so I
feel like I could make it work and I
really love their lippies so let's go
with my bling well geared it we're gonna
go with McLean you can give it to
angling that's hard hi Samantha my
question is do you have an idol like
artist or actor maybe okay so she said
do I have an idol such as like an artist
or an actress um I've always really
really enjoyed Reese Witherspoon always
kind of like looked up to her I just
kind of admired her not only for like
the work that she put out but um just
like her as a whole she's someone who I
never thought like really bought into
like celebrity this sort of thing so I
always really did look up to her for
that I almost dropped my phone I think
that's gonna be it for my very first
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A thank you guys so much
