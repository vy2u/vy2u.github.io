I'm really excited for today's video
because I'm going to go through a beauty
box with you this is a new beauty box to
me and I haven't actually peaked inside
of it yet so I'm very excited to open
this look at it myself and also share it
with you so the beauty box that I'm
going to be going over is called so she
waa I believe SWA is the correct
pronunciation and I believe it stands
for choice in French so this video is
actually in collaboration with a social
ah as well so I'm really excited to be
making this video with them I'm excited
for the box that they sent me and just
for kind of how their system works I
found that it was really really
intriguing and it kind of seemed right
up my alley because it's not necessarily
like your typical beauty box beauty
subscription where you know maybe you
take surveys to kind of get your
personality and what it is that you want
in your makeup but then you're just
getting sent random products or you know
everybody in that beauty box is getting
sent the same thing and it's not sort of
any personalization with this one you
are actually picking out exactly what
you want so when we decided that we are
going to work together so suave said you
know head on over to our website and
pick out your five samples that you want
and so I was actually able to pick out
exactly what it was I wanted your exact
shades you know I picked out a lipstick
I gotta pick the lipstick shade that I
want it so that to me was what interest
me right away because why I cancelled my
other subscription boxes was because I
just wasn't using the products in there
there were other products that I didn't
love I didn't love the shades maybe I
didn't even like the brands and it was
just beginning to be like a waste of
money and a waste a product for me so
when I saw that you could actually pick
these out down to the very exact shade
that you want that is what really
intrigued me and how the social all
works is that you are actually going to
get samples of whatever it is that you
choose and I thought that was
interesting because it's not necessarily
like Minnie's or deluxe sizes that
they're sending you like they're
actually taking the product and
bring out samples for you and sending it
so I'm really curious to look inside
this box to see what these samples look
like but when you go to the social web
site and reading through it it says you
know we want to be like an online makeup
counter for you so instead of having to
go out to the stores and you know test
things out there and try things out
there like you're gonna pick exactly
what you want to try out and then we'll
ship it directly to you and you get to
try it out so I thought that was really
cool and really interesting and I will
tell you when they said to me you know
okay go ahead and pick out your five
products and I went to their website I
was over whelm i think it took me like
two or three days to get back to them
with my five products because they had
like 30 pages or something just filled
with amazing high end products and I was
like I want to try all of them I had
such a huge list going and I was trying
to like Whittle it down and see what the
fact that I really wanted I try to
choose a variety of products and say
knew that I was going to be filming this
video so i believe i have like
foundation concealer bronzer blush and a
lipstick i'm pretty sure is what I chose
so I don't have any makeup on my face
right now I do have my eyes and my brows
done but I wanted to actually try them
out as well also to not only show you
what's inside the box but because
they're sending us in like sample styles
I wanted to show you guys like is it
easy to try it on from the samples that
they give you is it harder to try it on
I really have no idea how this is going
to work but I thought a Tryon might be a
little bit better and then you'll also
see some of my first impressions from
these high-end products that I have
never tried before and I'm really really
excited to so a little bit more about
social OGG and i will leave everything
linked down below as well but another
thing that i thought was really cool is
that they're not just a subscription
service you can do a monthly
subscription service but you don't have
to you can also do a la carte which i
think is really cool so there's you know
maybe you don't think you need samples
every single month that was another
thing with me when it came to
subscription boxes my makeup was just
like piling up and I wasn't getting two
things fast enough so that was another
reason why I
cancelled but you can also have the
option to do the a la carte there is a
subscription offer as well and I was
looking on their website and it says
it's fifteen dollars a month and you get
to pick out five beauty samples and also
include it with that is you get 250
points or a five dollar credit you can
build that up in your store and then you
can actually like cash in your points
that there was no expiration date but
you can actually cash in your points or
your credits and you can buy full sizes
of the items that you have sampled so I
just thought that was really cool what a
sweet system like I'm so excited to jump
into this box I believe that's
everything that I wanted to let you guys
know about social ah it will be linked
down in the description box below so
make sure that you check it out there if
you are interested in this but I'm
really excited to jump into this box and
see what is in here and get to trying
these samples so I cannot wait looks
like this and then when you open it up
this is what it looks like so it looks
like we have a box right here and we
have something right here okay so this
is like little applicators so like
little sponge tips and like little
q-tips so that must be to help you
actually apply the samples because
that's what I was like kind of curious
about so that's cool that they send that
there is also this in here as well I'm
not sure trying to think what sample I
have that might go in that but i can't
remember at the moment when that actual
social a box looks like this I really
hope I'm saying wha right cuz I'm gonna
say at the whole video like that's what
I think it is so that's what I'm gonna
say so when you open it up this is what
it looks like and then oh ok ok so let
me try not to drop anything so this is
what the inside of the box looks like
and this is what the different samples
look like so I was really curious what
the samples would actually look like
this is nice too so they have ok so they
have like little labels on the back of
arm assuming everything so that's
because I kind of can't remember what
all that I ordered so they have the
sample the name the brand what it
actually is and then I think like some
of the shades are on here too so
foundation concealer bronzer a blush and
Allah p okay so that should be good to
try everything out on my face as well so
i'm going to go ahead hop into this show
you my samples we're going to try them
on or see what i think and i'm pretty
excited for this I just pulled my hair
out of my sight since I'm going to be
trying on face products but the first
one I'm going to use is my foundation so
I picked out the remarkable foundation
from marc jacobs so I'm really excited
this is how the foundation sample is
sent so I grabbed out my Real Techniques
sponge and just going to go ahead ok so
the top just popped off there so looks
like okay so then you twist it at the
bottom and I can see the foundation
coming out so I'm just twisting the
bottom and then putting some of the
foundation on my Real Techniques sponge
so this is a $55 foundation and one of
the reasons why I decided this was the
foundation sample that I wanted to try
was because I have heard so many mixed
reviews on this foundation that I'm like
I honestly have no idea if I am going to
love it or hate it just because this is
one that I just see a lot of mixed
reviews on so I decided when I was
picking took my foundations I was like
you know what this seems like the best
one for me to sample because I've been
curious about getting it but I didn't
want to get it because the reviews you
know I mean there's always going to be
mixed reviews not everyone's going to
love everything and you know for
different reasons but this was one where
I just really felt like the reviews were
we're so so mixed so I just thought why
not grab my own sample of it I believe I
am in the shade 32 that's what my little
sample vial says but light maybe a
little bit too yellow for me but so
honestly as I'm putting it on like I
don't know I don't
don't feel like I am loving it um it
feels very thick I don't feel like it's
blending really well like it's really
patchy in some areas you know because
even on this cheek it's it's patchy so
as I'm blending it as going to say it
feels very full coverage and I'm looking
at the support website now it does say
it's full coverage and it does say that
you're supposed to be able to get full
coverage and like a very small amount it
says something like one dot for full
coverage obviously I had to use more
than just adopt for my whole face but I
mean it's definitely full coverage I
don't like that it's patchy in areas but
I don't know if I love how it makes my
face look or my face feel I mean
obviously I will wear it throughout the
day and I can review it for you guys
later but like first impressions I'm
really not loving on this which makes me
sad but again like I said it's $55 so
I'm least I'm being able to try it out
and with the sample size that I got like
I could probably try this foundation out
you know five times maybe even more and
actually be able to make my own opinion
before I would go out and purchase it
but hmm yeah first impression I'm not
like super pumped ok so the next time
that I'm gonna try is concealer so this
is what my concealer looks like it is
from NARS and is the radiant creamy
concealer and I picked the shade ginger
everyone talks about this concealer and
I've never gone through and gotten it so
I'm really excited to give it a truck
that I'm just going to apply some oh my
under eyes and then I'm i use my beauty
blender to blend it out so I'm really
excited I really wanted to show you guys
actually trying it on just because it is
so different like you know I didn't know
how the samples were going to work or
what they were going to look like or you
know are they going to be easy to
actually try out sort of things so I'm
glad that I made the decision
do this step along with you guys I just
feel like that foundation is so sick
like it's even hard to put the concealer
on okay so I'm just coming back with my
Real Techniques damp sponge and I'm just
going to blend that out I honestly feel
like that foundation is like going to
ruin everything else that I want to put
on my face and I'm totally not even
kidding it is like thick and I feel like
it's making this concealer hard to blend
even I'm just like really underwhelmed
with that foundation for the concealer I
think I picked ginger but I think it
almost is maybe even too dark for me
like it's definitely not like a
highlighting concealer shade probably
good for hiding dark circles but I'm
someone who like I tend to like to
highlight on my under eyes so I would
probably go in and highlight with
something or like use my laura mercier
secret brightening powder and bake with
that sort of thing if this was the
concealer that I was going to use on a
regular basis but I really like the way
that it's looking right now I would say
maybe like a medium coverage I don't
think it's a full coverage because I
have the new tart shape tape concealer
and that is a full-coverage concealer
this one I would say like maybe to be a
medium concealer it looks really nice
though I definitely want to try it out
without having this foundation on
because I honestly feel like it's
affecting it but so far that's looking
pretty good so I'm going to go ahead off
camera and just set this real quick set
the concealer I don't even like the way
the foundation looks like at my hairline
like it just looks cakey wow I'm really
glad that I tried that out and didn't
just buy it like seriously wow ok so I'm
going to go ahead and set my concealer
off camera and then i'll be back to try
some more so my next sample is going to
be the Chanel so late and a Chanel
bronzer i believe it is so i'm excited
to try this one out so this is what it
looks like it's in this like little pan
right here so i think i'm actually going
to use like one of the little applicator
that came in here to get the product out
and then maybe put it on my face and
then use my beauty blender to buff it
out because I don't feel like I have any
brushes small enough designed for a
cream bronzer to work so I'm going to
use the little applicator so that's
actually really handy that they send
along these little applicators because
otherwise I'd be like wait what do I do
next so like that maybe so let me grab
my beauty blender and both dead in first
just to see if I like it for the side so
take my Real Techniques sponge and just
blend that in so I actually I think that
looks really nice and I mean just from
the like amount that I'm sampling from
this one like I will have many chances
to try this one out which like really
excites me because one like people have
been talking about this for so long and
this is fifty dollars to buy it full
size it would be fifty dollars so I feel
like it's kind of hard to blend it in
over here because this is the spot where
like that foundation just like was so
super patchy so that's kind of being a
struggle but overall if I had to do
first impressions for the chanel de
Soleil I would think that they're pretty
darn good like I think that looks really
pretty and I can tell that it is easy to
blend if I was wearing a different
foundation because like this side
especially was a little bit more
challenging but nothing too bad so I'm
just going to put a little bit on my
forehead too because like another thing
I don't mean to be like hating on this
foundation so much and you know of
course like with everything like
sometimes first impressions aren't great
and then I learned to love something but
i just also feel like it made my skin
just like look really flat like so i'm
gonna kind of bronze up the forehead
here to just to like try to bring some
dimension back to my face because I just
feel like it looks really really mad and
really really flat so so I feel like I
feel like that bronzer kind of helped
bring some life back to my face but so
far first impressions for the
el de Soleil was I really like it i'm
excited to keep trying this out and like
I mean you guys can tell by this sample
like I'll be able to try this out quite
a few times and that really excites me
but next up I'm going to try the blush
and so the blush just came and like what
looks like a little pan right here so I
put it in this little guy that I was
like when I wonder what that's for free
shirts for the blush so the blush i'm
going to try one of the new like soft
duo blush as a thing that's called
something like that from marc jacobs as
well and the shade that i picked is in
lines and last night so there's kind of
like a close-up of what the blush looks
like and i go i just grabbed out my m4
27 from morphe i'm going to use it to
apply it i think i'll be able to get a
decent amount of product onto the brush
with that so this blush for the full
size is $42 and I've been seeing a lot
of people like especially a lot of
people got these from Influenster to try
out so I've been kind of seeing them a
lot lately really want to try this out
to see if it would be worth the price
because $42 for one blush seemed really
pricey to me and I know what Marc Jacobs
is more expensive and i usually like a
lot of what Marc Jacobs puts out like a
lot of the things that I've tried from
marc jacobs i have life so unfortunately
this foundation is like really throw me
through a loop and like even looking at
myself on camera I'm just not happy at
all with the foundation but I wanted to
give this blush to try it because I've
been seeing so much about it and I just
wanted to see if it was worth it so I
mean it goes on really nice i'm using a
duo fiber brush from morphe it applies
really nice I think it has really good
pigmentation I really like this color it
is soft pink but it's got like some
almost like some champagne notes in
there as well like peachy champagne
notes which i really like like this is
my color of blush that I really like to
wear so it looks like a really nice
blush off first impressions do I want to
pay $42 for the full size i don't know
but i will keep wearing it you know see
how it wears throughout the day test it
out a few times because like I said you
know even with a small pan like this i'm
still going to be able to try it out
multiple times which is really nice so i
can definitely give it a
this shot before deciding if I would
purchase the full size or not so that is
the Marc Jacobs blush and lines and last
night on my cheeks but the last product
that I have to try is a lippy I'm really
excited for this it's the Smashbox matte
liquid lipstick their new I think it's
called Oh is on liquid lipsticks and the
color that I picked out was in dream
huge so this is what the little sample
looks like now after I won through and
picked out my samples I also picked up
the Sephora give me some lip collection
which did have a Smashbox liquid
lipstick in there but that is in the
shade stepping out which is a brown and
I fell in love with these liquid
lipsticks so I'm really excited to try
another color this is definitely one I
mean obviously I picked the shade out so
it's definitely one that I've been
wanting to try out but I just kind of
look like that like kind of mahvish type
of shade that I really love so I'm
excited to see what this color looks
like and if I would want to repurchase
the full size because I already know
that i love the formula so I'm just
really excited to see what this color
looks like Miss Lee the lippy has you
know its own little lip applicator as
well so i'm just going to use that to
apply it so what's interesting to me i
definitely need to let it dry down of
course because it will dry down Matt
it's actually like a brighter pink than
I expected it to be I expected it to be
like much more Moff and it's actually a
brighter pink than I expected not that I
dislike it just again wasn't the shade
that I was expecting but I absolutely
like I feel like I cannot say enough
good things about the Smashbox liquid
lipsticks everyone is raving about them
and for a very good reason probably one
of the best formulas if not the best
formula of liquid lipsticks that I have
tried it stays on through absolutely
everything it doesn't crumble or kick up
or do weird things on your lips it stays
but it's also super super comfortable so
comfortable it's like you're not wearing
a liquid lipstick so I'm so excited to
try out another shade of this so it
dries down pretty fast too because it's
almost completely dry so definitely more
of a brighter pink than I was expecting
but I still think it looks really pretty
and it's a color
that i really like on myself so this is
from Smashbox this is in the shade dream
huge and that is my fifth and final
sample that I got and I will be trying
on for you guys so here is my complete
look using all of my samples from my
social wha box what do you guys think
let me know but that's actually going to
be everything for this video I know I
could have made it a lot quicker and not
actually done the trans but I just
thought that would be something like
really fun to go through with you guys
because you know I haven't you know
minus the liquid lipstick I haven't used
any of those other four products before
so you were kind of able to see a first
impression but I also wanted to show you
guys how I applied it with the samples
because I've never gotten a box like
that before so I was curious myself of
how I was going to be able to try the
samples on so i would just wanted to go
through that process with you guys as
well so hopefully you found that helpful
again all of the links for social ah
will be listed down the description box
below remember you can do a non
subscription and just kind of outlook
heart pick out the samples that you
would want to try or you can do the
membership and you know build points and
build actual like money credit towards
buying a full-size product I think it's
really cool if you're someone like me
and you've been looking for a new
subscription service you know maybe just
two other ones that are out there right
now I just simply aren't working out the
best for you I get it because I've been
there I've cancelled them and it's made
me really sad because I really wanted to
be able to keep trying products but
products that I actually wanted to try
out so I am really excited about the
social ah box I just want to say thank
you to them for working with me on this
video because I was excited for it i was
excited to put the products on my face
and see how I like them I will
definitely give like an update video on
all the products that I have tried out
you know maybe you'll see some in
favorites or I'll do like fabri fails on
them and give you guys an update after I
try them out a couple more times you
know see how they wear and last
throughout the day but I just thought
that was really cool to be able to try
those products because I don't know if I
ever would otherwise and you just get a
test amount at your house like such a
cool concept I absolutely love it I had
a lot of fun making this video for you
