today's video is going to be a tag video
so the night before I'm filming this my
friend live from live loves her makeup
posted the bility mini tag video I
watched it this morning when I woke up
and I was like oh my gosh yes I'm
putting it on my list but then I
actually had multiple people leave
comments on YouTube and also snapped me
asking me if I would do this tag video
so this is not what I had in mind to
film today but because people are
requesting it I'm like I'm just gonna go
ahead and film it right now so we just
got a couple questions up to talk about
I will have lives channel and her video
linked it down below of course but I
don't why don't we go ahead and get
started
alrighty so the first question is which
video were you afraid to post on YouTube
and why I think as of recently one video
that I was really nervous to post was a
video that I think it was called like
further thoughts or something like that
because I posted a will I buy a video
like I do every week and I was talking
about the Tarte shaped a foundation and
I filmed the video it was either prior
to the shade range coming out or just
prior to me seeing the shade range
coming out so I didn't know yet what was
happening there and so when I filmed the
video I mean I don't even talk about the
shade range there's no speak of that in
there I'm just talking about darts
coming out of the shape tape foundation
I love the shape tape concealer cool
imma buy it and I got completely torn
apart in my comment section and it was
horrifying to see because there was you
know there was never a point where I was
like their shade range is terrible and
they're leaving out a lot of people but
who cares let's just all buy it anyways
that was never a part of the video so to
be attacked and to be attacked on so
many personal levels in that video was
really quite shocking to me but the hard
part and the behind-the-scenes part that
people didn't know was happening was
that I was really struggling with my
depression I've talked about it here and
there on certain social media platforms
but talking about your mental health and
talking about going through a really
hard time is very hard and it's it's
making you a very vulnerable person so I
had
she's been stepping away from social
media I wasn't really watching YouTube
videos I was not on Instagram I was not
on Twitter because I mentally couldn't
take it at that time so that's why I'm
saying like perhaps the shade range
photo had come out but I didn't know
because what was on my phone and what I
was looking at was past photos so after
that happened I felt like I had to do
something to address what was going on
so it was later that night I just sat
down quick and filmed a video explaining
like why I hadn't like why I talked
about the shape tape foundation in that
way and it was so nice though to see so
many people in the comments saying
clearly she hasn't seen what's going on
clearly she doesn't know what's all
happened here and even if I hadn't of
pre filmed that video and even if I
hadn't have been off social media the
the shade range debacle I'm pretty sure
happened at the night before my beloit
video even posted so that video I filmed
my lullaby videos 2 3 some days even 4
days in advance I pre film everything
there's never a day where I'm posting a
video and it's going up on YouTube
that's not how I run things over here so
I don't know that I felt like I was I
was gonna lose no matter what it was
that I did there but so I filled this
video kind of explaining it and I went
into talking about this is why I've been
off social media this is why I didn't
see it and and all those sort of things
and that was a really challenging video
because of course there are still people
that were like no if you're lying and
it's like yes I just came on YouTube and
told thousands of people that I'm
depressed do you think that's easy to do
saying those words are so incredibly
difficult to say them to thousands of
people is extremely difficult so that
was a really tough video to film it was
a tough video to you know try to end it
back and you know cut out time so I just
was sitting here crying it was really
tough to film and I was terrified to
post it but I also got a lot of really
nice at feedback and people saying that
you know mental health shouldn't be a
stigma it shouldn't be something that we
don't talk about and it's nice to
seasoned people with a platform opened
up about it and you know make sure that
people know that it's okay
it's it's you know somewhat of a normal
thing that people can go through and it
can help when you see other people
struggling as well so that's what I took
away from that video that hopefully I
helped people I ended up having a lot of
email conversations I even had some
phone conversations with subscribers and
we would talk about certain things that
we were dealing with and I felt like I
truly helped at least a few people after
posting that video and that's what means
the most to me but it was so scary to
post that video and to put that out
there it was terrifying
so huh that was one video her second
question was as your channel grows do
you find it more difficult to stick to
your original opinions channel growth
like I said I wasn't planning on doing
this today and I watched a video this
morning but I haven't really like looked
again if the questions or thought about
what I would what my answers would be
but I have my channel girls do I find it
more difficult to stick to my original
opinions I don't think so I think from
when I started my channel to who I am
now I think that I've stayed very true
to myself and I think that I've stayed
very true to what it is I even want my
channel to be what kind of space I want
this to be how I want my videos to be
you know of course I hope that I like
grow and change in positive ways and I
hope that you know my editing gets
better and my lighting gets better and
you know I finally clean my desk behind
me wahoo it was a mess for the longest
time you know I hope I get better in
those ways but as far as like my actual
opinions I don't think so because I
think that I am I think that I'm pretty
firm on Who I am as a person I don't
really waver on that a lot when it comes
to my opinions on YouTube I think
throughout the years I've stayed you
know the two years I think that I've
stayed pretty true to myself you know
maybe that's an age thing I am 31 and I
feel like at this time in my life
especially like once turning 30 and now
31 I feel like I I Know Who I am and I'm
confident in myself honestly thinking of
me starting a YouTube channel and that's
like in my low 20s my mid 20s I truly
can't even imagine that because I
remember just like being all over the
place and not being confident in myself
so I feel like maybe my
maybe has something to do with this year
or two or just like life experiences in
general making me who I am but no I
don't think that I don't think my
opinions have changed but that's a good
question that's I'll be interested in to
see it and to hear how other people will
kind of answer that one now as my
channel grows you know I don't find it
necessarily difficult to stick to my
original opinion but sometimes it it I
have a little bit more I don't know if I
want to use the word fear and sang them
but it's just you know that you're
reaching more people and you know that
not everyone is going to agree with you
so sometimes like if I'm just really
excited about something I kind of get
this like thought in the back of my head
of like people aren't gonna like that
brand or they don't like the whatever it
is about the brand or the product or
whatever like you know that you're going
to make somebody mad saying that and
sometimes like that really sucks if it
makes any sense at all okay so the third
question is someone leaves you a shitty
comment that isn't related to the video
do you delete it or respond most of the
time when it comes to rude comments I
will delete them and I think that this
is a really interesting thing because
this is another way where youtubers will
not win there's so many ways and what
youtubers will not win but bad comments
is just another one of those because if
you delete it people will say things
like will she delete her bad comments
about her she can't take it bla bla bla
and if you respond to it and try to
defend yourself or explain yourself
people are like well now you're a bully
and you just can't take the bad comments
it's like okay well you're not gonna win
anyways so do whatever is most
comfortable to you for me it's usually
deleting it because it's just it's just
not necessary especially for someone who
does deal with depression who it can be
so challenging to read those terrible
things about yourself and then names
people are calling you and the things
that they're pinpointing about you that
aren't perfect and you know that but
they're also letting you know that
that's super challenging so why would
you want to read that why would you want
to keep that comment up in the same
regard I think negativity feeds
negativity when someone leaves a
negative comment about something there
can be a lot of other people that are
like I was thinking the same thing but
it wasn't gonna say but now she said it
so no I'm gonna say
I'm sipping on my keyboard and I'm gonna
bash that girl because someone else
started it so I'm gonna say it not do
and it's like no so I don't even want to
let the negativity breed to other people
I would rather just cut it out right
away and the third reason that kind of
goes into why I delete the comments is
because other people on my channel want
to defend me they want to stick up for
me so I have seen someone leave a
terrible comment and I haven't gotten
into it fast enough and then someone
else will comment underneath trying to
defend me or stick up to me and then all
of a sudden that person is being
attacked by the initial person and then
maybe someone comes up and tries to
attack that subscriber that was hot and
I'm like no I will not have that on my
channel I will not and I will not let an
innocent subscriber an innocent person
who watches my videos who was just
trying to be nice to me I will not let
them then be attacked by someone else I
will not so honestly that is one of the
main reasons why I delete bad comments
because I don't even want to give
anybody the chance to try to stick up
for me and then get attacked because
that is not like how horrible is that
you come to my channel you come to my
house you come to my party and you're
getting attacked by another guest of
mine no I'm gonna kick that guest out
you can stay that's why I think of it
the fourth and final question is tell us
how you feel about feel about your
channel currently are you happy are you
not I am really happy with my channel I
love my youtube channel I post six or
seven days a week and I don't think you
could do something that often if you
don't love it so I do I above my channel
um I there I think there's always room
to improve and to get better at and and
all of that and I try to do you know the
little things that people tell me that
they think will make my channel better
like adding music in my intro you know I
never thought like a five second intro
needed music and I never put it in there
but all of a sudden I was getting all
these comments like it would really help
if you put music in your intro I'm like
okay so I did and all of a sudden I was
getting all these nice comments like I
really like the music in your intro I'm
like okay so you know it's just like
little things like that that you know
hopefully are helping make my channel
better but
when it comes to lighting like I've been
trying to do better with my lighting
I've been trying to do better with my
background you know things like that
and I also really take into
consideration what people want to see on
my channel I love when people give me
recommendations like this one you know
what several people asked me if I would
do this tag that live dead I'm like yes
you know and and so I feel like all that
helps me out so much so you know am I
like the best youtuber out there and do
I have the best channel no none of that
and that's not what truly that's not
what I aspire to be to I just want to
keep doing this and as long as I'm
having such a good time YouTube is a ton
of work it is a ton of work and I told
myself around book release time I would
cut back my schedule to maybe only doing
five videos a week just because this
means that I film a video every day or
sometimes I fail to film two videos a
day and then I'm trying to keep up with
my Instagram as well and filming
tutorials for over on my Instagram and
then I'm trying to edit all these videos
and that's very time-consuming and so I
just told myself I was gonna cut back
I'm filming with us on Thursday my book
comes out tomorrow I've done a terrible
job of cutting down but I just get so
excited and there are so many videos I
want to do and it's just it's just one
of my favorite things I love being able
to post a video and then having the new
comments come in so I can talk with
people in the comments I know as of
right now I've been doing a terrible job
again book releases tomorrow it's been a
very stressful time but on a more normal
week for me I love being able to have
those conversations in there and it's
super fun to me so I really am very
happy with my channel and I try not to
put too much pressure on myself I felt
like once I surpassed the 50,000 mark
all of a sudden I felt myself putting
pressure on me that's when I ran out
like I bought these flowers and you can
never see this guy but I also bought a
vase but from where I said I always
cover up wine else like the flowers are
pretty but I was like oh my gosh my desk
is always a mess and my lighting is
always terrible and I was always just
too lazy to pull out all my different
lights and some of the lights are so big
they're upstairs and have to bring them
down and I was like no you need to do
better and you need to get all of your
lights set up and I tried to focus more
on editing and all of that but I try not
to put too much pressure on myself
because even though this is one of the
things that I consider a job you know I
consider a lot of different things a job
including writing books but including
doing YouTube as well but I love that I
get to choose what it is that I want to
do I choose to do YouTube no one is
forcing me to do YouTube YouTube don't
give me those good health benefits okay
so no one's no one's telling me to do
YouTube I do it because I want to do it
because I'm super passionate about it so
I am happy with my channel right now so
yeah that was a good question but other
than that that's going to do it for the
spill the tea Minnie tag video okay so
that is going to do it for this tag
video that came from my friend live from
live loves her makeup again I'll have
her tag video listed down below I also
list out the questions too in case you
decide that you want to do this tag but
thank you guys for asking me to do this
I hope that you enjoyed it it was kind
of nice I knew this was going to be a
bit of a shorter video we'll see how I
do but I needed something kind of
relaxing today my my book release nerves
have gotten the complete bust of me so
it was kind of nice to just sit down and
like chill for a second so that was a
good choice I'm glad looking about that
video then because this was a good one
to film today but I hope that you guys
did enjoy it of course if you do make
sure to give this video a thumbs up I
hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
