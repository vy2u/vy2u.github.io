today's video is going to be a new
spring clothing haul I have some items
here from both the topless clothing and
then also fashion Nova I'm going to be
showing you each of the items that I got
and also inserting actual Tryon Clips so
you can see what each of these items
look like on me I am super sick of
course because I'm just having that
month of May that wants to knock me down
so hard between a wisdom tooth
extraction
slicing my toe open and that's been very
gory and now getting a cold losing my
voice it's been super super fun so I'm
going to try to get to this video as
quickly as I can but that's why I
probably look a little bit sick and
sound more than a little bit sick I've
left to find outfits to share so let me
go ahead and get started so I'm going to
start with tableau of clothing I have
done other top left hauls in the past so
if you haven't seen those videos tapleft
clothing is a clothing boutique that was
started by my sister-in-law step and I
am now doing some work with our mostly
on like our influencer program and that
sort of thing but also some online
marketing I do have a discount code for
top less clothing that you can use it's
just Samantha for a 15% off your first
purchase have it linked down below it
will also have all of the pieces linked
down below as well they do have an
actual like physical store in Carroll
Iowa where Steph lives and then there's
also be full online boutique website as
well so I'll have that link down below
and they just started shipping to Canada
to jump into it the first item that I
picked up is just this camo t-shirt it's
a pretty like basic camo cheeks and silk
sense of camo lately I have two
long-sleeved ones as well one even has a
hoodie ones like a little bit maybe of
like at mice or camo shirt now I have
the t-shirt and then I saw they're all
from top left and then I just thought
they also got a camo tank top into it
I'm like well right now I want that too
you just love camo and this t-shirt is
super super comfortable I got mine in a
size small I like it because it's just
it's not like oversized it's not like
super tight like and the waist or
anything like that and it's a little bit
longer which I do like because I wear
leggings a lot so I've just been really
appreciating the top again it's just
super comfy and casual and I just really
like how it looks on and this one is a
$32 for the camo t-shirt okay the next
item that I got is another t-shirt I'm I
like I don't know how to explain my
style I feel like I have two very
different sets of styles and I feel like
you will see them in this video you will
see what I gravitate towards when it
comes to top off clothing and you'll see
what I gravitate towards when it comes
to fashion Nova
hablas is kind of more of like my
everyday maybe a little bit more unlike
the casual side of what I wear but I
really do enjoy t-shirts but not like
slouchy type of t-shirts you know what
I'm saying like I like them till as I be
just a little bit nicer but they are
what I gravitate towards a ton so I got
this great II called the sleek pocket
tee it's $35 so you can see it has a
little packet on the front as well and
when it says it's like the sleek t-shirt
that's definitely how it feels the
material is very soft and very like
slinky and I just love the way that this
looks on again it's a little bit bigger
it's not like super tight anywhere it's
a little bit longer I can wear it with
leggings but what I actually like to do
because it is longer I like to like tie
it in a knot on the side and I've been
doing that with it recently and I really
like it especially because I've been
wearing like high-waisted jeans more and
I feel like the high-waisted jeans with
like a casualty like this with a little
knot on the side I spend like one of my
staple outfits I've really been enjoying
wearing this I also feel like if you put
a choker on or some good accessories and
then pair it even was like nice heels or
like even nicer flip-flops like it's not
like super super casual but then you can
also dress it down so I kind of I'm
enjoying it for that part so I feel like
I can kids I feel like I can get kind of
two different sides to this t-shirt
again this is the sleek pocket see it's
$35 and I got mine in size small as well
okay next up I got another casual temper
shirt I actually got this from my mom as
well from other sites what she requested
for Mother's Day but it is just a like
baseball style t-shirt I think is what
they call them with like the 3/4 sleeve
and it says hey batter batter on it you
guys know I'm a huge baseball fan I'm
huge Cubs fan and it's kind of like this
like red burgundy type of color and then
the sleeves are the 3/4 sleeves with the
red at the bottom I got mine in a size
and these are $29 I'm not sure these air
bills on the website anymore well I
don't think they are because I couldn't
find him had the times that I was
filming this video I was looking for it
and I wasn't able to find it so these
might all be sold out for both top of
clothing and fashion Nova if there are
things that you see even you know from
my video or other people's videos or if
you're even just browsing on the website
there's something that you want to see
for both of these boutiques I recommend
just going for it and I promise you I'm
not just saying that it's because what
does the teak style like this the
inventory gets turned over very quickly
and a lot of times there's a smaller
inventory of what they carry so when
those sizes and there's like limited
sizes as well so a lot of times once
they're gone they're gone there's not
always a ton of restocking happening
because new styles are coming in and
they're always looking for you know new
items to bring into the stores both top
of clothing and I know fashion Nova is
that way too so I wanted to pass it
along if there's anything that you have
your eye on
I really do say go forward if it is
something that you really do want
because it's not it might not be
available in the next time you look it's
happened to me both on top off and on
fashion go on and on all their clothing
boutique sites I'm a big baseball fan so
as my mom so I thought this one would
just be super cute so it's next one of
the top that's actually a little bit
outside my comfort zone but I just
really wanted to do it and I've noticed
the style kind of becoming more in trend
so this is what the top looks like it's
a really beautiful blush color it has a
long sleeves and there's some detail
right here and then they come down into
more of the bell-sleeve which I've been
seeing the bell sleeves a lot so when I
saw it I was like I know it's on trend
right now I absolutely am obsessed with
this blush color I think it is a
beautiful the Vivienne blush shop is $46
and I got mine in a small I wasn't sure
now it's kind of going back and forth on
it but then again it was the like oh no
once the cells out the back it does have
a little button detail right there so
it's a little bit open in the back but
it comes up really high like you'll see
in the Tryon clip but I really did just
think the sleeves were a lot of fun and
again I know that they're really on
trend right now it's just a very
feminine
ready top I thought it paired really
well with like white denim either white
pants or even some white shorts for when
we get into a little bit warmer weather
maybe you're going somewhere that's like
casual ish but you still want to look
nice type of thing I think this would be
a really good shirt to wear with it it's
just really comfortable and I thought it
looked really pretty and feminine on so
I'm really glad that I decided to go for
this one so again this is the Vivienne
blush top it's 46 dollars and I got mine
in sa small the last one that I got from
tableaus clothing is actually a sports
bra so chopped off clothing it does
carry a variety of different items so
there's definitely like the main focus
there's also a plus-size section and
knives on the website as well from tops
dresses bottoms shoes handbags
accessories that's all in there there is
a kids section as well especially for a
little girls so if you're a mom tiny
little girls I definitely suggest
checking out that section because they
have really cute things but they also do
have some athletic wear so this is the
sports bra and I thought it was really
cute because it has all this crisscross
detail in the front so it's kind of fun
even towards like a regular sports bra
or you can wear it under you know I top
to kind of like give a little eye
dimension it to the top if you will so
these are $24 and I believe they are the
one size so again this is what the
crisscross sports bra looks like it is a
pretty thin sheer material so if you're
someone who like jogs and your sports
bra type of thing you want to be able to
use this sports bra for that purpose
because of it being more on the sheer
side but if you're just doing like a
casual workout or again if you just want
to pop it underneath a top to show the
crisscross detail in the front I think
that would be a really nice look I've
done it myself and I really liked how it
looked so that is the sports bra and the
nuts of final items that I got from top
off clothing again all of that will be
linked in the description box down below
and my code for the 15% off will be down
there as well and then I'm going to move
on to what I picked up from fashion Nova
I didn't say what was top of clothing I
did purchase everything myself I do get
an employee discount because I do work
with table of clothing but I did
purchase everything myself
except for the sports prospected just
add that into my package were so that
was really cool from fashion Nova I did
purchase some of these and then some of
the products were also sent to me as
well from fashion elbow which was really
cool I have done a fresh anova video in
the past as well and I talked about the
video I was feeling frustrated about a
couple of the items especially the denim
because I hear about fashion Nova denim
and jeans the most and what I had
purchased previously did not work for me
and I was super frustrated about it and
I wasn't getting help from the customer
service which also had me feeling pretty
frustrated I did from the hear back from
that one but two people from customer
service and they really tried to help me
which I appreciated a lot with the denim
I do have three different pairs of jeans
to show here a lot of people what I was
reading and when I watched fashion over
videos and I was reading the reviews a
lot of people are saying that the
waistband is so stretchy so sometimes
the jeans can run a little bit bigger so
I wear either size one or three and
denim so when I saw that I was like oh
okay I'll order in the size one then
because of the waistband is stretch here
and they might be a little bit bigger
than the threes might be too big on me
and I like couldn't even get in path
like my thighs or like my knees it was
crazy they were like even when I took
them out of the package I was like these
are not going to work and they sure
didn't so I talked to fashion Nova and
you know gave them my measurements and
they helped me out and I decided to go
to three but these first ones are the
canopy jeans and they are in white so
they are all white denim skinny jeans
they are high waisted and they do have a
little cut at each knee so these are the
canopy jeans I'll have them listed down
below so I got mine in a size 3 and they
actually do fit really well I am all of
my denims that I got are in a size 3 and
those fit so well I really like the
high-waisted look which is funny because
even like a year ago I was like
high-waisted no that's mom jeans right
and now it's like a looked at I'm super
obsessed with but once I figured out my
correct sizing with fashion Nova I feel
like it really did help because I do
really like how these jeans looks and
I'm really happy that I decided to grab
of these jeans I do really like the
highways that I just think they're very
flattering and then I don't even have
like much of a booty but I feel like
somehow these jeans like help me out so
I've been really really happy with these
so again these are the canopy jeans in
white and I got mine in a size 3 now I
forgot to mention it D white jeans for
$32.99 so I definitely don't think
that's a bad price for the jeans and
then I picked up a black pair as well
these are called the blanched jeans
they're $29.99 and again I got mine in a
size 3 so I don't know if you'll be able
to tell the bus as I'm holding them up
but you should be able to see in the
clip they are ripped completely like
from the upper thigh all the way down
past the knee they're very ripped and I
love it I was really really wanting some
ripped black jeans I just love the way
it looks again I love the way that they
look on their a3 they're high-waisted I
just think they're really flattering I
wore these to a chainsmokers counter and
I wore a crop top with them and I just
thought it like cinches in the waist
nicely and then again it can kind of
help give me a bit of a bum which i
don't really have and I just really
really have been enjoying these they do
have the stretchy waistband as well the
only thing that I don't like about these
jeans is that they pick up everything
like hair fuzzies my dog hair my hair
only has to use like a lint roller on
them so that's the only downfall to them
but other than that I absolutely love
them like it's been really really
enjoying these jeans I just I think they
are super cute and super flattering as
well for these words the blanche jeans
$29.99 and it's got my Nano size three
flats are denim that I got these are
just called to classic high waist skinny
jeans and these are in dark so just dark
denim jeans I'm a skinny leg
high-waisted size three again and I am
like truly obsessed with these I was
never really much of a junior I wear
leggings all the time it's just what I
prefer to wear but I have found myself
wearing jeans more I think that I would
have to say that I reach for these the
most I just really enjoy how flattering
that they love
on the body and I also enjoy the
high-waisted because I feel like I never
had to worry like Kansas I do wear a
shorter shirt like if I'm going to like
bend over do anything like that I don't
have to worry about like the pains like
falling down which is always super
annoying and I just enjoy it like how
secure I feel and high-waisted jeans
it's so funny because I never thought I
would be a fan of high-waisted jeans but
I definitely am and I just really have
been enjoying these statements such a
staple in my collection because I really
don't even own that many pair of jeans
like when I do cut around my closet and
stuff a lot of times I was getting rid
of my jeans and denim because I just
wasn't wearing them a whole lot is
really nice add these to my collection
and they're really stretchy ways like
the fashion it was known for again I'm
just really happy that I was able to
find my correct size in the fashion know
machines because now that I have now I
can see what people are talking about
and absolutely writing about because
they do just they just like do something
for your shape I appreciate it they're
comfortable are the classic high-waisted
skinny jeans in dark a in mine in a size
3 and the last few items I got from
fashion Nova are all dresses now this
first one is the granted love dress in
blue I got mine in size small and I am
obsessed with this dress I was actually
wearing it on snapchat the other day I
posted a photo of me on it in it on
Instagram Adele so full suede material
so it is like super soft and it just
looks very flattering on so you'll be
able to kind of see from these dresses
like the other side of the style that I
was talking about and if you've missed
my my past fashion hauls I like to dress
a little bit on the softer side for when
I go out that is just like the style
that I prefer and these dresses just
like I just I love them so it has like
the nicest sticker sleeves right here
and I really don't feel like even like
sharing it like this I feel like it
doesn't even look like it's super low
Chi but it definitely is pretty low cut
it goes down a little bit in the back as
well and then it just has a zipper and
then also in the front here if you can
tell they hold it up you'll be able to
tell them to try and clip to what it
does like slit up in the front of it too
not enough that
you're going to be like showing anything
I love how comfortable this dress is I
liked it a bit of a thicker material so
it's a little bit more forgiving in
certain places and I just like this is
one of my favorite dresses so I've been
really really happy with this one this
one is $29.99 looks like it's on sale
right now for 24 97 at the time that I'm
filming so of course it will be a link
down below to the granted a love dress
in blue the next address I got is called
the I'm every woman dress in mas so this
is a what the dress looks like and then
it has a slit on one side and so again
this is more of almost like with the
body con type a dress so it's super
super tight it's not as thick of a
material as the blue dress that I showed
but it is still thicker and so a little
bit more forgiving as well and then it
has the sleeves here and then a
racerback but then it does have the slit
just from the one side so you can show a
little bit of leg and I really like that
again I just think it's really
flattering on it looks really feminine
and I just I really like this dress as
well I think it's super pretty and it's
going to be great for summer so again I
got mine in size small
it's $29.99 right now it says it's on
sale for 1997 so I'll have it linked
down below it's that I'm every woman
dress in mob again I really love this
color like one of my like staple colors
that I just love having in my collection
and a really pretty dress it's more
lightweight than the blue one as well
and again just really flattering on me
so that is the next dress that I picked
up from fashion Nova also in a size mop
I mean in the last I know that I have
for this clothing haul is the only item
after everything that I've mentioned
that did not really work for me this is
called we talked about us dress in it
taupe I got mine in a size small and it
is just too big in the front so it's
going to be kind of hard to show you
here I did include a Tryon clip of it
but I'm basically holding it the whole
time I mean even though you're just
going to see my bra but it just opens
too far in the front I mean I know it's
supposed to be it is supposed to be
extremely low-cut in the front but it
just like goes out too much and shows
every
like not really appropriate to be able
to wear which I'm super bummed about I'm
holding on to it because I I just I
don't know if there's anything that I
can do about it if you guys have any
ideas let me know like I don't know if
it's something that I'd be able to get
like tailor or altered I'm not sure
because I really like it again it's the
solo suede material like the blue dress
it's just really comfortable on it does
have also an extremely high slit like
this was a dress that I wasn't for sure
it was going to work for me anyways
because I knew that it was super low-cut
and then also with a really high slit so
I was like so is this going to work and
I feel like if it would just cover my
chest I would actually be able to pull
it off somewhere like maybe if I went on
a vacation somewhere I'm probably not
going to go grocery shopping in the
middle aisle oh it's a sign but I don't
know maybe I will also like to to
because it does have like the choker
detail around the neck right into it
which I thought was really fun again I
just love this material I like it
because like from the back it actually
looks like a bit of a longer dress so if
you were like somewhere peoples like oh
look that nice dress that woman has done
and then you turn around and they're
like what what I just thought it was
really funny so those are the things in
life that makes me happy it is the talk
about stress and taupe it's usually
$29.99 I'm looking at the website right
now this is on sale for 1298 again it
will be linked down below I got mine in
a size small I don't think it comes in a
size smaller than that and again I just
the front it just like super bums me out
I really really wish that this dress
what it worked out again I'm going to
hold on to it and see if I can make
something happen with it I love this
material I really did like this dress I
just wish it fit a little bit better but
after that that it's the last item I
have from fashion Nova I also did want
to mention that I have a discount code
with them too I completely forgot about
it when I first start talking about
fashion Nova it is just Excel Sam March
so that will be in the description box
down below as well not an affiliate code
I don't make money off of it it's just a
code for you same insulin will top off
it'll be down there they didn't put an
expiration date on it so I think you can
just use it any time if you were going
to shop on a fashion Nova you can just
use XO same march and you'll get 15% off
your order which i think is really cool
so everything that I mentioned for
fashion Nova and also of course top left
within the description box down below
but after that that's going to do it for
my spring clothing haul and Tryon and I
really hope that you enjoyed this video

good time because guess what another
storm is rolling in I swear the last
couple times I sat down to film the
storms has been like alright girls

little bit darker my voice is about gone
