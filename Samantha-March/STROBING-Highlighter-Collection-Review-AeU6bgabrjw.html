how are you today today's video is going
to be all about strobing so if you don't
know what's rubbing is it is basically
doing like a really intense highlighter
and it's not doing any contour or
bronzing so basically for your face
you're just really putting the effort in
to give that glow I thought about doing
a tutorial and then i decided that i'm
just going to kind of share the products
that i have for highlighting or strobing
and then also how I apply it where you
apply at the brushes I use probably less
than 10 products maybe 10 if you add in
the brushes to share with you so yeah
that is going to be today's video
strobing this is a little bit on the
late side because it was just like super
popular these last few months but people
are still making the strobing videos and
tutorials and talking about it so I had
it on my list to do it for a while and I
thought well before summer officially
ends why don't I get in quick strobing
video like to see all about how I
highlight and strobe okay if I have a
few drugstore more affordable items to
talk about so I'm going to go through
them first and then kind of move my way
up into the higher end products but so
to start it off so strobing is like I
said it's basically highlighting so you
want to take wherever you're going to
highlight your face like normal and that
is where you're going to put it now
those areas are like the tops of your
cheekbones and it's almost like you can
think about making a see around your
eyes so you want to get the top of the
cheekbones and go up versus like
highlighting down you want to think
going up in that see motion you can
highlight down the center of your nose
some people go all the way down the
center of their nose some go a little
bit down and then like do a dot on the
end of your nose you can do whatever it
is you prefer play with the look see
what looks best on you you would also do
your Cupid's bow so right above your
upper lip a little bit on your chin I
mean you can dust like I said you're
going to bring that C up so you can dust
like above your eyebrows them do it in
the center of your forehead I mean you
can even really take it to the extreme
you can put highlighter on the tops of
your shoulder blades you can put it on
your collar bones you can bring it into
your chest what what we want to do when
we highlight and stir
bulb is wherever the sun is going to
reflect you and you get that natural
highlight that's where you want to put
the product to just enhance it even more
like that makes some sense I do not have
any highlighter on right now because at
the end of the video I'm going to show
you like where I put it and all that
sort of thing and I'll actually apply it
for you on camera hopefully my phone
will be be able to pick it up since I
still record off of my phone but some of
the products that I have and that I
wanted to talk about and give my
feedback on so the first ones that I
have to talk about are these Revlon
Photoready skin lights and I have two
shades because that's just I don't know
why I bought two shades you really only
need one shade but i have 200 pink light
and also 300 peach light and i don't
really use them together i just use one
at a time if i want to use it now to be
honest i didn't love these products and
i'll put a little bit on my hand here so
you can see what they look like this top
on right here is the pink rose and the
one on the bottom is the peach light so
those are what the shades look like that
is what they look like swatched on my
hand now I like I said I didn't
absolutely love these on their own I
didn't feel like they did a whole lot
for me I tend to gravitate towards the
pink light because I feel like it does
about our job at reflecting I almost
thought the peach one was almost too
close to like my skin tone that it
wasn't really giving me any sort of and
enhanced glow at any point like to do I
have another product that I'll mention
and I actually layer the products so
that is what I prefer to use I prefer to
use this as like a base and then I will
take a powder highlighter and put it
over it and in that sense I think it
works really well because it like I said
it's almost like a base for the powder
highlight and I feel like it makes the
powder form stay on longer so I don't
typically use these by themselves unless
I want something that's just a very
subtle glow and I don't want to bully
strobe and freaked everyone out with how
highlighted my face
looks then I'll use these on their own
but typically i do use it as the base be
that in mind the next two products that
i have are the ones that they are not
considered highlighters they are
actually both I shadows one is an
eyeshadow pigment but these are what I
use on top of the Revlon photo lights
one is the Maybelline New York color
tattoo it's the pure pigment and the
shade is barely brazen and then the
other eye shadow that I have that I will
use as a highlighter is the laurea
l'oreal paris infallible in iced latte
so again these on their own I mean they
are not technically highlighters their
eye shadows but just because i thought
the color would match pretty well one
day I tried they work ok by themselves
but if I put them on top of the Revlon
photo lights I think it looks really
good that is the barely brazen on my
finger is it right here so that is the
Maybelline Color tattoo pigment and
barely brazen that is the infallible in
iced latte that is right here on the end
is iced latte so you can I don't know
hopefully it's picking it up but they
are very pretty colors I just didn't
think they had the lasting power unless
I have some sort of cream or liquid
based on top of that if that makes sense
but together I think it looks really
good and they're all really affordable
options all of those four products I
mentioned that you can get at the
drugstore they're all drugstore billions
either revlon lore'l or maybelline ab
one more from maybelline to show you
this is the Maybelline New York master
highlight highlighting bronzer so
honestly again this is a product that i
actually did not love i was looking to
get a new blush and i don't know for
some reason this was labeled blush it
was in the blush section when i bought
it from Ulta then I came home and I was
like no it's a highlighting bronzer I
mean a highlight bronzer those are
usually two different things so I was
like wait what is this site owned
bronzer palette which highlight skin and
soft like contours cheeks for an
instantly defined glow and up you can
see that it has
like a wide variety of shades in there
and usually what I do is I just run my
finger across and get a bunch of
different shades I don't usually like
try to pick out different ones but
that's kind of what it looks like on my
finger and then let's see if I have some
room on my hand here so I don't know
it's right here I don't know if it's
going to pick up very well because
honestly it is so light I really don't
notice it when I wear it I really have
to get pretty heavy-handed if I'm trying
to make this a highlighter sometimes i
like to use it as more like a blush
topper so i'll put my blush on and then
i'll just take this and kind of run it
over the apples of my cheeks and it kind
of like just makes it glow a little bit
more honestly it just doesn't stay on
very long though but i did want to
mention it because it is considered a
highlighter I think maybe if you have
fair skin it could work out really well
for you but I didn't love it myself but
I wanted to be sure to mention it
because it is used as a highlighter and
I wanted to talk about all the products
that I have but this is another one
that's from Maybelline so you can get it
at drop zone moving on to the next batch
of products I want to give a shout out
to the mary-lou manizer and this is by
the bomb now i order my products from
the bomb usually online but i also just
noticed that they are available at kohls
I I see people say that these are more
affordable line but then I also see
people call them more high-end I'm
looking on amazon for this one and it
says it's $21 but it comes with a brush
and I think that's what I got night I
really hated the brush so I mean don't
feel like you need to get the brush
because I didn't think it did anything
and I'm pretty sure a throughway but to
me $21 for a highlighter is more
expensive I like the Revlon photo lights
those for like eight to nine dollars so
just want to throw that out there one I
absolutely love this was my first like
real highlighter that I got and I just
love it this is what it looks like it's
a very like I see highlighter I would
call it that's what it looks like on my
finger and there it is swatched on my
hand I love it I think it's beautiful I
mean I use it all the time when it was
my
only highlighter I was very happy to be
using it I don't feel like I needed
anything else in place of it it stays on
and it just looks absolutely beautiful
the next one that I have it came in my
benefit box that I've talked about I got
like a little box from benefit that has
like I shadows mascara and they were all
like mini sizes some bronzer things like
that but it also came with their what's
up highlighter so mine is just a little
mini version but it's just the stick
cream highlighter that's what it looks
like and this one is really really
intense very pigmented I mean you are
going to shine bright like a light bulb
when you wear this I do suggest when you
are going to put it on that you put it
on your finger first and then dab it and
don't do like don't try to draw it on
just what no because that's not going to
work so I definitely do recommend
putting it on your finger first and then
putting it on your skin but if you're
looking for something that will give you
a lot of glow and that is very intense
the what's up highlighter from benefit
is really good and then I have two more
highlighters to talk about and honestly
these are probably my favorite and the
group I don't know it's hard to pick
what I absolutely love these I have a
full size in a mini size so these are
both from Becca cosmetics this little
one is a free sample that I got from
ordering on sephora and this is an opal
and then my full size is champagne pop
this is the highlighter that youtuber
jaclyn hill created with becca cosmetics
i absolutely love these and i think they
are so beautiful unfortunately my opel
shattered literally the day I bought it
so I can't really hold it up to the
camera for you but I can try to get some
on my finger here and hopefully not
spill on myself so that is what opal
looks like and that's opal on my hand
and then champagne pop this is what
champagne pop looks like it's a gorgeous
peachy champagne II highlighter there it
is on my finger it is the last one on my
hand so that a champagne pop next
well as you can hopefully see on camera
the two really don't look alike and some
people are wondering if they were kind
of the same shade I don't think so opal
honestly is probably more similar to the
mary-lou manizer than it is to the
champagne pop but here are all four of
those higher end swatches on my hand
with the mary-lou manizer from the bomb
what's up from benefit and then becca
opal and becca champagne pop so those
are the four on my hand now the Becca
products i absolutely love and i will
say these are also very super intense so
if you are looking for a like you just
want to get your highlight on you want
to get your strobe on that day Becca
cosmetics both opal and champagne pop
are going to do it for you they are so
beautiful on the skin champagne pop I
was getting a little obsessed with like
I was doing the whole putting it on my
shoulder blades and my collarbone and
like literally all over my face that
people are probably like do you know
what oil control is and I'm like no it's
highlighter I mean it was like it was
getting ridiculous I feel like I've may
be toned it down a little bit sometimes
but i absolutely love both abeka
products they are more expensive they
are thirty-eight dollars if you can get
a free sample I mean hey that's pretty
good news because honestly highlighters
I feel like they're so hard to go
through when you have a size like this
like how long is it going to take me to
hit pan on this like I don't know I mean
I do put it basically all over my body
so maybe it won't be that long but
absolutely love both the products
definitely recommend them and I think
they're beautiful I don't talk about how
to apply and what I use to apply
honestly what works out so well and what
I started out is doing was just using my
finger you just dip your finger in there
and you pat it along where you want it
to go you can pat it along your upper
lip you can put it down your nose your
finger is going to work perfectly fine
if you don't have any brushes that
you're able to use your finger will
definitely do the job have three brushes
that I will chat with you about I
believe they are all either drugstore or
affordable so that's good the first one
that I see a lot of people use to do
highlighter is the spam brush this is
from bhcosmetics so you just dip it in
your highlight
and you would fan it across your cheek
bones just like that and you could place
it down the bridge of your nose like
that up in here up here yep get it all
so the fan brush works really well for
that and I like the fan brush I use it
quite a bit some other brushes that you
can use this is the elf small tapered
brush I think this was like three
dollars on target what I actually use
this particular elf brush for is my
under eye like translucent powder so I
actually do not use this as a
highlighter because I don't want those
two to mix and I'm like putting on my
translucent powder but I'm like
highlighting under my eyes I don't want
that to happen but I know a lot of
people use the small tapered brushes for
their highlighters and even I've even
see like bigger youtubers use this exact
elf small tapered brush to use
highlighter and it works really well
just to be able to put it on there works
great that one I have is also from the
elf line and this is their flawless
concealer brush so this was also i think
three dollars at target so a little bit
different has a more but has that like
domed top but this is one that I use the
most for highlighting and it's so easy
just to dip it in there and you kind of
do one of these motions and I think it
works great so this is what I gravitate
towards there are some you know of
course fabulous higher-end brushes I
know like Sigma and more if you make
really great brushes for highlighting I
can find you know some similar ones or
someone's that maybe the other bigger
youtubers talk about and link those
below as well if you are interested in
something like that I believe more feet
is usually more affordable Sigma is more
expensive but I will find those for you
and everything that I've talked about
everything that I've mentioned the
brushes I've mentioned all of that will
be in the description box below but just
show you guys how I actually put the
highlighter on so I'm going to be using
champagne pop from Becca because I said
how much I loved it and I'm using the
elf the concealer brush so and I really
really hope this does show up on my
because who knows but so just dip it in
and then I started at the top of my
cheekbones and I almost make like a
circle and then just run it across the
bottom like heading towards the mate
like the middle of like the Apple part
of your cheekbone and then I go in and I
do the same thing and so when it comes
to strobing strobing is all like that's
what your focus is on for your face so
normally i do two brushes like this and
i typically call myself pretty good then
I usually would do the rest of my face
maybe I'd come back with one more dip
sometimes I don't usually when I'm
strobing are only highlighting I go in
like four or five times because we're
trying to make this intense this is the
point of our look like we can't just go
halfway and call it strobing so I'm just
going to keep doing that circular motion
at the top and then dust it down bring
it down so you won't pretty much you
always want to start out and then brush
in like I wouldn't suggest dipping it in
and then like clapping it right on your
cheekbone and then trying to blend it
out because that just sounds kind of
hard so I'm gonna do one more pass here
then we'll go to the other side how's
that look you guys see it I really hope
you can see it on camera so then I'm
just going to go ahead and do the other
side same thing so at the top work in a
circular motion and bring it down
you guys see that side I'm sure
hopefully you can see that side for the
rest of my face like I said I'm just
going to bring it down the bridge of my
nose on top of my Cupid's bow I'm gonna
do that little like dot at the end of my
nose that I was talking about come along
in here and I grab a little bit more put
it on my chin a little bit more dude
above my eyebrows and the center of my
forehead and if you see that like oh no
you've made it too intense you can just
grab your foundation brush and blend it
out I mean no big deal because I've done
it before I've gone a little too
heavy-handed got a little little crazy
with my highlighter but that's okay so
those are the places that I'm going to
place it like i said if you want to you
can just I mean keep dousing yourself
with it whatever it is you want to do
but that is how I typically apply my
highlighter and how I get the strobing
effect again i wish i had a viewfinder
so i can make sure you can actually see
the product that i placed but fingers
crossed hopefully you can alright so
that is my strobing video i really hope
you guys enjoyed it I hope you like the
products that I mentioned and reviewed
hopefully if you are looking for some
new highlighters or you're new to the
world of highlighting you found some
good recommendations if you are new to
highlighting honestly I recommend going
the drugstore out first and getting more
comfortable with it you know get those
drugstore brushes there's really no need
to go out and spend thirty dollars on a
brush when you can spend three dollars
on an elf brush and it works just fine
really hope you enjoyed the swatches the
reviews the recommendations if you did
please be sure to give this video a
thumbs up I would love to know what you
think about it cuz I honestly was a
little bit intimidated to make the
strobing video but I'm glad I did it I
had a lot of fun making it and just
talking about my favorite highlighters
highlighting is something that was
totally new to me when I really started
to get into the beauty world and
especially doing the YouTube and it is
one thing that I've come to absolutely
love even when I do a pretty bigger face
I'm always making sure to do my
highlighter because it's just a proud
that I love now I do also want to ask
the look on my face right now minus the
champagne pop that I just put on but the
look that I have right now in all of the
makeup i have on from face eyes and lips
there's all drugstore and i've been
seeing a lot of people are doing like
drugstore back to school looks as i know
that we're all like getting back to
school so I wanted to ask would you guys
want me to do another tutorial but
haven't be basically this look pretty
simple basic drugstore affordable
tutorial I don't know you guys let me
know what I was putting my makeup on
this morning and I just realized that
everything that I was reaching for all
happened to be drug store and so that
kind of gave me the idea but like I said
the only thing now that is not drugstore
on my face is the champagne pop I later
but of course I have those highlighters
I could even maybe demonstrate how I do
the cream highlighter and then on top
use the powder form so i don't know i
just wanted to throw it out to you guys
if you guys like that idea and want me
to do it please just let me know and it
will definitely be the next tutorial i
was going to do the strobing tutorial
and then I thought I mean basically that
was just the tutorial that I did and it
only took me a few seconds so that's why
I decided to go the more in-depth review
route but I do want to do another
tutorial because I'm starting to feel a
little bit more comfortable doing those
on camera but if you like the drugstore
back to school let's let me know if
there's something else that you would
want to see please just comment below
and let me know before you go please do
subscribe because that would be
incredible and I will just catch you
