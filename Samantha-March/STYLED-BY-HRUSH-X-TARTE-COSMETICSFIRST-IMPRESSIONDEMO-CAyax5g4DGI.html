I'm really excited for today's video
because it is going to be a first
impressions swatches mini review a mini
eye tutorial on the brand new styled by
her Uche with Tarte cosmetics eye and
cheek palette I am so excited for this I
actually mentioned this in my will I buy
up video and I basically talked to
myself into buying it while filming that
video and I'm just so so excited that I
got it so I'm gonna go through the
palette I will swatch all the colors I
will show a demo of applying some of
these to get this eye look and the cheek
look that I did today as well I'll do a
mini review talk about where you can get
it how much it is and if I think you
should purchase it so I'm really excited
so why don't we go ahead and jump into
it but the box for it looks like it's
very shiny so it's like hard to show but
it just says styled by her Uche the IM
chic palette from Tarte and then on the
back it does have her picture and then
it says just a little bit about her
brush that an enthusiast of all things
artistic and she's a self-taught makeup
artist she started doing makeup as a
hobby in her bedroom
a decade later she's built an empire
known a style by huge and cultivated and
oppressive celebrity following her Uche
is inspired by the everyday woman and
credits her clients for allowing her to
express her art freely and experiment
with techniques she has learned from oil
painting that's very cool it says she's
recognized as a top celebrity artist and
master makeup educator worldwide so it's
this easy to work palette features
versatile shades handpicked by her Rouge
to mix and match and enhance an eye
color or skin tone so that is what the
box looks like and then this is what the
actual palette looks like so this is the
front of it the back is just gold open
it up inside you do have a mirror here
and then you have your eyeshadow shades
and your blush shade so that is what the
inside looks like it is so hard to show
these things with the mayor because it's
like so blinding and you guys can see my
messy messy room but again that is what
the inside of the palette looks like so
when I first saw this come out from
Tarte I just kept looking at it just one
of those things where I kept going to
the Tarte website and I kept looking at
pictures of it and I kept looking at
swatches of it
you don't really need this palette
because I'm truly not like a huge
eyeshadow palette hoarder like I just I
just don't know if I need it but once I
realized that I kept going to look at it
that like it caught my eye that much I
was like okay I'm just going to get it
interesting because a lot of times with
collaborations I'm buying things because
I want to support whoever it is that is
doing the collaboration and to be really
really honest I don't really follow her
offeri much I actually don't know a lot
about her I believe that she does like
the Kardashians makeup and the Jenner's
makeup and I notice that she works on
other celebrities as well but I actually
don't really follow her on social media
so this is definitely a palette that I
bought because of the palette and not
just because of a collaboration which is
kind of something that I thought was
unique as well because like I said
usually when it comes to collaborations
but basically buying it because I want
to support the person who was in the
collaboration with so this was just a
palette that stood out to me even if you
just took away the collaboration that's
how much the palette like spoke to me so
I was really excited to get it I like
that it's very like sleek and compact
it's not very big it was actually
smaller than I expected it will make it
really nice to travel with and
especially because it has the big mirror
inside anna has eyeshadows and blushes
that's very cool so I think it would be
simple to travel with this retails for
$30 I got mine on the tarte cosmetics
website you can only purchase one from
the tarte cosmetics website and you
can't use any discounts or coupons or
anything like that when you purchase
this but it's also going to be on online
retailers such as Ulta on August 21st
and then in stores on September 4th I
believe it was so you can get it on
those different websites any links that
I can find it to get this I will leave
that in the description box below in
case you are interested in purchasing
one for yourself mention that I will be
doing a giveaway for this one as well I
was able to pick up an extra run from
office so stay tuned to the end because
there will be a giveaway for this so
also in the box it did come with a
little card like this that has four
different looks on it and kind of
explains how to do it
not use this for my eye look today I
just kind of like completely forgot
about it but I do definitely want to try
some of these because there's some
really interesting looks on here so I
think the next time that I use this
palette I will pick like my favorite
look from this little card but I really
like when palettes comes with these like
inspiration cards because sometimes I
need them because I'll look at the pedal
it and be like so overwhelmed like I
want to put all the colors on my eyes
what do I do
so I'll try that next time but that does
come include it as well so from the
Tarte website it says this is a limited
edition palette most collapse are and
includes three Maps three Luster's and
they mix a base crease aligner and
highlight shadows for complete eye looks
grab your favorite eyeshadow brush and
follow along with for step-by-step
guides from her Rouge to take your luck
from daytime to workflow to soiree and
playtime who's your favorite blush brush
finished with the matte coral blush to
warm up your look with a cheeky contour
so that is just a little bit about the
palette and then now I know I feel like
you guys are all waiting for the
swatches so let's go ahead and open this
up and show you guys some swatches
it's a white gold and it's definitely a
shimmer shade so that is what it looks
like on my finger and then there it is
swatched out so that is bliss that we
have smitten and spin is actually what I
used all over my eyelid today so this
one is smitten one is described as pink
champagne which I would definitely agree
with
okay so there is smitten so watched out
and the next one I was so excited about
this color is called royal and it is
described as a shimmering berry so there
it is on my finger right here and then
so there it is swatch tout this is my
first time it's watching it and I
actually am NOT as blown away by that
color as I thought I was going to be it
would be a bit deeper but it's
definitely coming off as not quite as
deep as I expected it so there it is I
built it up a few times so there is
royal on the end yeah not quite what I
was expecting the first two shimmers I
really really enjoyed royal not quite
what I was expecting but still a very
pretty color and I will be really
excited to use that on my eyes so that
is the first row so we have bliss
smitten and royal ok so then I'm going
to come in with pinch is one that I used
on my eyes as well I used it in the
crease so that is pinch I don't feel
like pinch swatches very well because
it's such like a like a neutral color
like it really matches my skin tone so
you can't see it super great but I
thought it looked really pretty on the
eyes and on the website it is described
as a warm golden peach so that one was
pinched the next one is Kitty and this
is what I used on my lower lash line so
that one is kitty
so there is Kitty swatched out on my
hand that one I thought was really
really pretty and this one is described
as a matte brown blast one is vamp which
this color like shocked me this is the
first color that I came in with on my
crease and I was not expecting it to be
as pigmented as it was so there it is on
my hand so that one is vamp and I don't
even feel like it's showing that good in
the swatch but when I put it on my eyes
I was like well I was not expecting that
pigmentation I it took me a while to
blend out that one is described as a
taupe shade I was shocked at the
pigmentation of that one and I feel like
vamp had the most kickback like none of
the other shades really have a lot of
Fallout or like kick back when it came
to putting my brush in them except for
vampa but I also feel like vamp is like
the most pigmented out of the whole
palette so understandable that has the
more kickback but those are the bottom
three swatches right there's we have
pinched Kitty and then BAM the blush is
just described as a coral blush so there
is the blush on at my pinky right there
and then there it is swatch tout it's
just a really nice coral pinky blush I
actually have never tried any of the
Tarte blushes but I know that they are
talked about so much and when I first
used it I was really happy with it
again this was also very pigmented like
I went in with my brush quite a bit
because I felt like it looked like a
lighter color and then when I actually
put it on that was like that has more
than I was expecting so I can't compare
it to the other Tarte blushes because I
don't know how well they are but from
what I've seen from my first impression
I thought the blush was really amazing
as well so those are all the swatches
and I have the clip
running of the makeup tutorial that I
used as well also if you guys would like
to see another like more traditional
makeup tutorial using this palette where
I actually go through it and show you
guys and tell you guys what I'm doing
please do let me know because I would
like to do a full tutorial because I
would like to use that royal color even
though it didn't swatch as good as ice
might I still want to be able to put it
on my eyes and see what kind of look I
can get out of it so let me know it may
be like a fall look since that was more
of a berry color let me know if you guys
would want to see that tutorial but
those are the swatches in there and now
I want to hop into kind of my first
impression the guy said it was really
the palette and what was inside the
palette that caught my attention when I
was thinking about if I wanted to
purchase this I'm really happy that I
did based on first impressions like I
mentioned it's $30 feeling six
eyeshadows plus a very large blush and
it is good for traveling and I really
like the selection of these colors
because you can do neutral you can do
natural you can do more of a going-out
look like there's a good combination of
colors in here I don't feel like you'll
be stuck only being able to do like one
two two two even three looks I feel like
with the color selection is in here and
the finishes that these are that you'll
be able to do a variety of colors which
like I said that's why I'm excited to
keep playing with this palette and keep
seeing what different types of makeup
looks that I can come up with like today
I just did like pink champagne kind of
basic shimmer eye but I'm excited to
experiment and see what else I can come
up with with this palette so I'm excited
for that and $30 I honestly didn't that
think was a bad price for what you are
getting I was impressed by the swatches
so like I said I have smitten vamp Kitty
and pinch on my eyes there was only two
colors that I did not use vamp I was
especially impressed with it is
definitely the most pigmented out of the
entire palette I was blown away by that
color and I can't wait to keep using it
smitten I thought was a beautiful pink
champagne color and when I use this on
my eyelids I did not use any mac fix+ or
any sort of dampening a spray on my
brush to be able to get more
pigmentation out of it and this is what
I got I was very impressed by it I would
like to try out maybe I'll try like
bliss with the mac fix+ and see what
type of pigmentation I get from it but I
did not feel like you needed it Whisman
kidney I only placed on my lower lash
line but just from what I picked up on
the brush and as I was smudging it out
it was very pigmented as well and that's
probably one of the best ones that
actually is swatched super super
pigmented pinch I think is a really
really unique color
very curious about this one and even
though this one I didn't feel like
swatch the best I still feel like it
looked really pretty on the eyes and I
actually really like I really want to
play around with that color and maybe
put it on the whole eyelid maybe blend
it out with kitty or do something fun
with royal but pinches of color that
really excites me and I thought it was a
unique color as well so bliss is that
like white gold color I'm really really
excited to play with that I love the way
that it's washed I thought I looked
beautiful royal was the only one but I
didn't think like swatch really well but
again I need to see what it does on the
eyes sometimes things swatch really good
and don't look good as you actually
apply it and then sometimes it's vice
versa so I don't want to give my final
thoughts on royal yet just based on a
swatch because now I definitely will use
this the next time that I play with this
palette I'm definitely gonna use royal
to see what kind of color I can come up
with and cheeky like I said I thought
was a beautiful blush I really like the
way that it looks on the cheekbones I
thought it was very pigmented and very
easy to blend out I used my morphe key
for when applying that shade and I
thought it was beautiful so my first
impression right now is that I'm really
really really happy that I got this
definitely because like I said you know
of course this is just a first
impression I just put these shadows onto
my eyelids I just watched him out I do
need to keep playing with it but I will
definitely let you guys know if you want
to see a review video like I could do a
full tutorial and then also put my
review in there to see after I've played
with it a few times and tried about
different colors if I still think it
would be worth it I could definitely do
it for you guys but if you're thinking
right now like you're like I really want
to get it right now should I get it
should I not get it hopefully the
swatches helped you hopefully the
tutorial helped you but my honest
feedback what I will say right now is
that I am very impressed with this
palette I'm really excited that I got it
I think it's beautiful I'm so excited to
create the different looks with it it's
super happy that I got it even though
