today's video I'm pretty excited to do
it's going to be all about summer
essentials this was a video that I had
zero plans on filming but I actually
started getting it requested and when
someone would request it there was a
bunch of thumbs up and people asking for
me to do it so I thought okay
and at first I didn't think I could make
this video because I thought what I
don't have anything to say and then once
I started thinking about it I actually
made a very long list so I have a lot to
chat about today it's going to be a sum
of my lifestyle favorites for summer and
then of course as some of my beauty must
haves at first summer as well so when we
go ahead and get into it so of course I
don't think that you can mention a
summer essentials without mentioning SPF
I mean this is just like this is most
important thing please don't forget your
SPF when you're going out we take
sunscreen very seriously around here so
next up one of my essentials already
this summer is just a good old regular
hat I got this from our I think it's the
Dick's Sporting Goods that I got it from
but it's from Carrie Underwood's on like
fitness align and I just wear it a lot
when we're like running errands in this
in the summer in the morning if Mitch
and I go out I don't even have any
makeup on yet maybe we're going to like
grab breakfast and then just run errands
run to the store I just throw my hat on
that's it that's all I do but it's also
nice for when I'm walking Aires and
maybe I do already have my makeup done
and I don't want to get like sunglasses
lines but also don't want to like
full-on be looking into the sun's glare
I just put my hat on when I Walker and I
feel like that helps or another summer
essential that you could have is a big
floppy hat that says margaritas porfavor
is this meant like the funnest Beach hat
you have ever seen I mean come on like
someone is taking my photo tonight some
someone's taking my photo this hat is
freaking hilarious I thought it
expressed it was like 50% off and I was
like it's asking for margaritas I mean
what and I mean also you know of course
these do can protect your skin and your
face from
the Sun but we go boating a lot in the
summer and we have like a boating trip
for my friends like my girlfriend's
birthday coming up and I'm like yeah I'm
gonna bring this hat I think I look
divine I said we can't have summer
essentials without some Sunny's so I
have two pairs of sunglasses here these
ones are kind of my oh geez these are
the Midnight Runners from Key Australia
now I have a very tiny head so a lot of
sunglasses just do not work on me but I
feel like because the size of these are
so thick as well I can pull off the
larger frames I don't like to wear these
so when my hair is up because then I
feel like you can just notice that
they're too big for my small face but I
really do like these I like the frames
on them again these are deep Midnight
Runners at from @ki Australia and the
next pair I got I just got these in
these are also from a key Australia and
these are the collaboration with desi
Perkins these are the high key fades and
these are also the minis so when does he
came out with the high keys I purchased
them right away I purchased the gold
pair but again I have a small head I
can't pull off a lot of sunglasses again
why hats are good for me but so when she
came out with the minis I was like okay
I'm going to try those it was over
Memorial Day weekend they were happening
like 20% off and these were included in
there so I decided to pick them up I
really like the look of the fades and I
really like the black Sunny's as well so
I really wanted them and it was so funny
I put them on and my husband was like
those look big I'm like these are even
the mini he's like why do I have such a
small head this is not fair but I I
think I can still like just barely pull
them off but I'm like man how big were
the regular ones then but I remember
those
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even go out
in public with them I mean they were I
mean they were huge on my face so I was
super disappointed I ended up giving
them away but these are the Heike minis
and I think I'm gonna like these I think
I think I'm gonna like these what do you
guys think the next time I do want to
talk about self tanners I have to hear
that I could recommend I do not suggest
laying out in the summer I never suggest
handing beds I kind of just naturally
get more tan in the summer even though I
always use an SPF outside
just outside a lot around the water a
lot we have a very energetic dog who
wants to go outside a lot to hear that
I've been liking this one I just
mentioned in my most recent make up
monthly in my favorite section that this
is from tan luxe and it's the water
they're hydrating a self-tan water I've
just been really liking this stuff I
feel like it gives you a really natural
tan I just do some sprays on my like
regular tanning mitt and then I spread
it all over my body I feel like you kind
of have to use a lot but I feel like
again I feel like it's a really natural
tan and I feel like it fades really
naturally as well and then I've also
been able to try out the loving tan
recently which has been really exciting
they did send me a package this one is
the 2-hour express deluxe bronzing
mousse and this one is a medium that was
the the darkest one that they sent me
for the two hour Express I do like the
two hour Express that we have that
option because sometimes if I don't
remember to put my tanner on in the
morning then it's too late
I don't like to sleep in my self tanner
not necessarily that it like stains the
sheets or anything I just don't like the
smell and sleeping on the smell of it so
the 2:00 hour is pretty cool the medium
I felt like also gave me a natural tan
but like a beginning of summer like I
wasn't too too dark but it was like oh
maybe you've been outside once their
choice kind of thing is what I felt from
the medium so I think I would like it
even more for the summer months in dart
but I think medium would also be nice
for a good winter 1/2 but this was
really easy to use this is more of a
mousse and then you just pump it on and
I don't feel like you need as much with
this which is good I felt like I'm very
a little bit was really covering my
whole body and it was nice with this one
because you can actually see where
you're putting the self-tanner
where's what the tan water it is
completely clear so you can't really
tell if you missed a spot so I've
actually been really been liking this
one as well so those would be two at
Tanner's that I'd recommend one of my
Holy Grails first summer this is a big
deal I recommend at this last summer I
was put in favourites videos left summer
every purchased it this is a holy grail
for me this is the Vita Liberata body
blur I love this stuff and I can
go a summer without this stuff I went
through an entire bottle last summer I
pulled it out I mean it was a couple
months ago I pulled it out just like
cleaning and I was like oh my gosh
there's barely any in there so I had to
get another one because I need this this
is an instant HD skin finisher it's
24-hour where I have mine in the medium
shade and basically what it is I I
mostly use it on the backs of my legs
your girl's thirty-one I have cellulite
I have stretch marks even though I work
out that doesn't really affect cellulite
and stretch marks so especially the
backs of my legs
I am super uncomfortable with so when it
comes to summer and wearing shorts and
swimsuits I do not have confidence to
pull that off at all this is such a huge
game-changer for me if we're going out
and I'm wearing a dress or maybe I want
to wear shorts anytime we go boating
anytime we go boating I have this on
especially the backs of my legs it just
kind of smooths and blurs everything out
there's a little bit of like a shimmer
to lip but nothing like it doesn't make
your legs look glittery or anything so I
also like to put it all over my legs
just to kind of give them like a shine
and make them look nice but especially
on the backs of my legs and like towards
my and like my hips as well I will put a
lot of it there just to smooth and blur
everything out I think it helps us so
much this stuff is this stuff is a holy
grail for me for the summer so speaking
of summer clothing and showing off some
skin and all of that a summer essential
to me definitely is fitness and having a
good workout plan I think it is so
important if you guys follow me on like
snapchat or you watch my Instagram
stories I like to share the workouts
that I'm doing I use a website it's
called cracker I've talked about them a
ton as well throughout my different
platforms but that's the website that I
use for my workouts and it's really nice
because they have so many different
workouts in there for whatever it is
that you want to do you can add things
to your calendar you can get email
reminders to do your workouts and then
it's really nice because I just like to
workout at home I don't have a trainer I
don't have
gym membership I work from home and I'm
a homebody I even want to workout at
home so it's really nice I'll just pull
the videos up on my phone I'll prop it
up next to the TV sometimes I'll just
send them to my TV and I'll do the
workouts through there definitely I
think it's really good to have a good
fitness or workout plan you know not
even just for like the physical sense of
it but I do think that working out
getting your blood flowing and all of
that doing something good for yourself
getting up and moving I think it's just
better for your confidence as well so
yeah I definitely think that's important
Crocker is you do pay for a monthly
membership with it and then you can get
all these unlimited videos and like I
said there's a ton of them but I will
have a link down there it isn't
affiliate link it's this isn't sponsored
or anything like that but I've been
using Rutgers like since they came
around so it's been several years so
they actually gave me an affiliate link
with them but if you would want to try
them out for two weeks you can do a two
week free trial to see if it's something
that you would like to do if you're
someone who does like to work at home if
you're someone who needs to go to the
gym to you know stay accountable or you
know you have the funds for a trainer or
you'd like to do classes or things like
that you know I don't think it would
work for you but maybe for like me you
like working at home you could try that
but definitely a good fitness plan
that's the summer essential for me so
another one of my summer essentials
that's kind of random is a little book
bag so I actually bought this for when
we were doing our Arizona trip back in
March because I didn't want to bring
like my big purse with me and I know I
knew would be going a lot of places but
I didn't want to do a little clutch I
wanted to do something a little bit
nicer and I ended up going with this
backpack I got this for twelve dollars
at Kohl's which was awesome because I
have Mitch and I were also at American
Eagle shopping for a ham like for shorts
and stuff for Arizona and I noticed a
little bag and I was like oh I think I
want that and I picked it up and it was
$89 and I was like mm-hmm
don't want it that bad and then we went
to close and I found it for twelve I was
like yes score but I really like this
especially because if we go out for a
long period of times like if we're going
out to the campgrounds if we're doing
any like music festivals where we're
gone you know we start off early in the
morning or early in the afternoon and
we're going all the way to the evening I
I don't want to bring my big purse with
me but maybe I don't want to bring the
small clutch maybe my crossbody doesn't
like the biggest things with me with
crossbodies as they don't go with my
outfit which really drives me crazy but
this is really nice because it's big you
can put so much stuff in it you have all
these different compartments yeah I was
just putting my phone in the side here
but you have all these different
compartments for whatever it is you need
you have zippers you have pockets on the
side and then you can just wear it as a
little backpack I've seen a lot of
people wear these a lot of people on
Instagram I see a lot of the beauty
bloggers on their trips with these
little backpacks but like check for
places like Kohl's or even maybe even
like some discount stores would have
these but this right here this is gonna
go a lot of places with me this summer
so I was trying to think about if there
was any like clothes or swimsuits or
even like shoes that I would mention
this video and I'm like I don't really
know everybody's styles are so different
like what what am I gonna recommend I
really do like the color yellow recently
I make a yellow shirts all that fun
stuff and so I kind of decide to skip
over that but I do have two accessories
that I keep going for I keep wearing on
camera off camera you guys probably know
one is hoop earrings I've been loving my
hoops lately and honestly I just went to
Charlotte Russe and I got a pair of like
seven different hoops all different
styles from like really big ones to
really small ones for like five bucks or
something boom super easy and then
another one of my essentials is my watch
I love these watches you see me wear
them all of the time I've talked about
them I wear them so often I've
recommended them and like gift guides
and stuff I get these from your they're
called J they're spelled J Ord you can
find them on Amazon and then also on
their website this one here is from the
Casio series and I just think it's like
a really classic watch I like the really
slim band and then kind of like the
larger face here I also get a lot of
compliments from guys when I wear these
because they're the wood watches and add
are something about that I get a ton of
compliments from guys when I wear these
out but that would be another one of my
summer essentials I very rarely leave
home without my watch so I'll have them
linked down below your doll so did give
me a a coupon it's now Nana filly
it's coupon or anything like that but
you can get $50 off a watch plus a free
engraving if you use the code March
Beauty word so that's my Instagram
handle so I will have that in the
description box down below in case
you're interested if you want to watch
or you know someone who wants to watch
and I have just a little just for you
coupon if you want to take some money
off but those are kind of my summer
essential accessories that I need
another summer essential is definitely a
perfume and this guy has just stolen my
heart I think I've also put it in a
makeup monthly in my favorites this is
from a defined me and it's the scent
Audrey I love this as so much I can't
even tell you
he'll first I like that it's kind of
smaller and compact because I also do
like my Kenzel perfume but it's the
really long one and I can't just like
slip it into my clutch or like this it's
really easily in my purse my clutch my
crossbody my book bag I mean it's just
easy to travel with even though it is
glass but it's such a light refreshing
summary is sent to me again this one is
Audrey if I didn't say this is now my
third defying me perfume and I just
think that they're really nice I think
there are a really cool company as well
and you can also find them on alte but
yeah this is like my go-to perfume I
really like don't leave the house
without it anymore either you know you
go outside and you get hot and you get
sweaty and like yeah you have your
deodorant on but still spread this Busia
then before we have over into some
beauty products my final summer
essential for the lifestyle is of course
books and reading obviously I'm going to
recommend Christie this is my latest
novel this is my sixth book that just
went on that sale just a couple weeks
ago and it is available now on Amazon if
you're interested or send copies are
available to purchase from my website
which is chocolate plus calm I'll have
both of those link down below I like to
think this is summer reading um it's
definitely a little bit more
lighthearted it's kind of in the
chickaletta's onra we follow a group of
six girlfriends so the series name is
the six we follow them and just kind of
everything that they're going through
I'm really excited to keep reading the
rest of the series because Christy has
gotten so much good feedback but
definitely good summer reading if you
want more recommendations I'm also a
book blogger so I'm always reviewing
books over on my blog which is chiclet
plus
or another thing that I really love is
audible and listening to audiobooks I
guess I go out with areas a lot I take
her for a lot of walks and I always just
have an audiobook queued up on my phone
and so I can listen to it while I'm
walking summer reading of course at the
top of my list for summer essentials
moving over to some beauty essentials
I'm just gonna have like one or two from
each category to kind of touch on and a
highlight but these are some like I must
have beauty products for the summer the
first again is going to be SPF for your
face I'm not getting a thing sunscreen
is very important but for me I also
think it's important to have it like in
your skincare routine and just
automatically be protecting your skin
before you even go outside and put your
sunscreen on you already have your face
protect it right now what I'm using is
this is from Olay it's the Total Effects
whip and it has SPF 25 super super
lightweight it's kind of intimidating
because of course it is super white but
it absorbs into the skin right away it
doesn't leave the white cast on me and I
think that it protects the skin so well
the favorite foundation for the summer
is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi if you
watch my latest makeup haul I bought
this one and I said that this was on my
favorite foundations but I was trying to
get through some of my other foundations
before I purchased this but I went ahead
and did it anyways because this is my
favorite foundation for the summer I had
to have it I have been getting asked for
my favorite summer foundations and I
asked on Instagram I did a poll and over
a thousand people said that they wanted
to see that video so I'll go ahead and
make that so I just thought I would
throw this one in here my favorite
summer foundation I like the way it
looks on my skin it gives you a Lumi
glow without being too much you know cuz
sometimes I'm more glowy in the summer
anyways it just makes the skin look so
nice it's very long wearing
I love the coverage it's just a rug
store hello can you beat that this is my
favorite foundation for the summer also
a good setting spray I think is very
important this is from Urban Decay it is
the chill setting spray so it's supposed
to be kind of more of like a cooling
spray which also is good for the summer
so I think a setting powder is super
important and this one this is a new one
to me but I really want to mention it
because I've been super impressed with
this this is the all nighter setting
powder
from urban decay so sus let's say
waterproof a setting powder okay so I
haven't really been able to test the
waterproofness of this so much but this
is super like a super mattifying powder
the first time I put this on it really
mattified my skin and it seemed to like
shrink my pores you know I already had
foundation on and everything and I swept
this over especially this area right
here I have larger pores and I was like
where did my pores go and while my skin
all the sudden looks really good like
this is a powder that you can see
something instantly happening with and I
have been super impressed by that
especially if it's supposed to make your
foundations waterproof as well I think
that would be great for summer but I've
only tried this a handful of time so far
but honestly I'm very impressed with it
of course a waterproof mascara is super
important my current favorite right now
is the flower beauty lash warrior I
can't stop wearing this mascara I think
that's phenomenal I'm so impressed that
it doesn't transfer onto my skin I've
worn it in super super hot dates outside
here in Iowa I've had zero transfer onto
my skin I love the way it makes my
lashes looks it gives me a length
it gives me a volume once again it's
drugstores it's definitely going to be
my go to summer mascara this year having
a long wear eyeliner is super important
as well I love eyeliner I'm someone who
like doesn't leave the house without
eyeliner it's just always spend one of
my go-to s I think it's important to
have a good kind of like a regular liner
and then also I think a colorful liner
is really great for summer as well these
ones here this is from a pier and it's
the OnPoint liner this one is in brown
and it's called down-to-earth I actually
did get sent a refill over from octa Lee
and Pierre and they sent me a bunch of
they're on point liners which I was so
excited about these are so creamy they
last a very long time they show up super
easily in the waterline but they're self
sharpening so actually when you put the
cap back on and you twist it you're
actually sharpening the eyeliner so it's
always on point one of my favorite
eyeliners I've mentioned them quite a
bit on my channel and I'm super happy to
get some more colors in to try but
down-to-earth is a great brown liner and
especially like first summer I don't go
for black a ton I go for more Brown or
like a nude or a beige in the waterline
or else I go really colorful
and I think that's a lot of fun this is
one of my favorite colorful liners I was
wearing this in my one of my videos the
other day and I love this liner to pair
it with something super simple on the
eyes and then just put some blue liner
this is deep end from Urban Decay put
some of this in your waterline
maybe smudge it on your lower lash line
and it just makes the eyes pop and it's
such an easy easy thing to do to really
brighten up an eye look or to take it to
the next level this is one of their 24/7
glide-on pencils again
I love these from Urban Decay they're
super creamy they do glide on super
easily and they stay for a very long
time in the waterline so these are two
of my favorite eyeliners and summer
essentials next up I want to talk about
these sigma-i bases I've talked about
them in a previous video I put them in
the fine category in my makeup monthly
cuz I was like I don't know if everybody
quite needs these but uh I gotta tell
you guys that I actually have really
been enjoying these and I even said in
that video like it's a really nice for
simple makeup because you can just swipe
it on there technically like an eye
primer or an eye base and you can wear
shadows over them or you can wear them
by themselves and the shade bubbly is my
go-to so they have three different
shades this is bubbly this is my go-to
at the moment I think it is so beautiful
look at that isn't that just so pretty
so pretty you just put it all over the
eyes you don't need a brush you can just
blend it in with this you can use your
finger to blend it if you want this is
what I have been wearing what I'm going
to be outside when we went boating that
day this is what I put on and a little
bit of mascara and that's about it
because it's so like shiny and pretty
but it's so long wearing it's holding up
through the heat I mean it's holding up
from me leaving my house early in the
morning to coming home late at night
it's I swear to you it must be
waterproof I've gone on the lake with
this nothing it doesn't budge it doesn't
fade and I think this shade is so pretty
I was actually wearing just this on my
eyes and a video recently the Urban
Decay liner and then I think maybe I had
lashes on in that video I can't remember
but people are asking me what are you
wearing for your eyeshadow like I've
looked in your description box I can't
find it I'm like it's just the Sigma I
this that's it that's all there's no
shadow on top of it nothing so I
actually really like these I think I'm
going to be wearing them quite a bit but
especially bubbly
we sold right now litters have also
become my go-to you guys have probably
notice I have a lot of glitter in my eye
looks as of recently and I think it's
such an easy way to really like spice up
a look and quickly and easily and of
course two of my favorite litters i have
urban decay and then also Stila so the
urban decay are they're heavy metal
glitter liners I really like these
especially for doing any sort of liner
in my crease area or if I want to put
any glitter in my crease area or if I
want to put any glitter like on the
lower lash line I think it's just really
easy to use they have so many colors I
think that they're really easy to apply
and also the Stila glitters I mean these
are so easy if I just want to do glitter
look all over my eyes again it looks
like you've spent a lot of time on your
makeup but you haven't and I don't even
think that you need to our lashes when
you do these kind of glitter looks it's
just it's so pretty even if you just do
a bunch of mascara I also think a bright
lip as a summer essential especially if
you're doing a super easy eye look not
really much on the eyes you can just do
a really pop and lip color to spice up
your look so we're just mentioned
recently in my lip pics video and
they're two of my favorite kind of more
bright lip colors I do a lot of nudes of
course but these are just super fun this
first one here is from Sigma Beauty and
it's in a foxglove and it's a really
cool kind of a bright berry color I
think that one is super fun and is also
a very long wearing liquid lipstick
formula the next one is NYX in San Paulo
and it's just a really pretty bright
pink again I think both of these just
are really flattering in the summer time
just bright pops of color for the lips
and I really like both of these formulas
as well glosses can also be a summer
essential I always say that I'm not a
big lipgloss girl but I find myself
wearing them more and more for the
summer time you know they're easy to put
over a lipstick or you can also wear
them on their own too
two of my favorites this one here from
Mac and under the sheets I mean if you
watch my lip pics video I wore it
several times throughout the month of
May it's so pretty it's a nice nude
gloss but it has a little bit of shimmer
in it as well and I just think it's so
so flattering
so this one here is the Mac under the
sheets and another one of my favorite
glosses this is from Urban Decay and it
is
in a back talk I like this one a lot
because it has more pigment to it and I
can wear this one by itself and it just
kind of gives my lips a little bit of
color
there's backtalk gives my lips some
color and also some shine so these two
would be two of my favorite glasses for
summer and to finish it off we can't
have a summer essentials video without
talking about some highlight I think a
bright pop in blinding highlight is
great for summer as well two of my
favorites that I've been reaching for a
lot lately one is from a persona
cosmetics and this is their calli
glow highlighter in Zuma and then the
other one that I've been really really
liking is from Oprah and this one is in
pillow talk
I'll do swatches of them both I mean
honestly there's so many highlighters
I've could have mentioned and so many
that I love but these two I think are
just really really pretty
this one from persona cosmetics and Zuma
has impressed me from the get-go I mean
look at that highlight it is stunning
it's a really beautiful kind of like a
champagne gold it has a tiny tiny bit of
glitter in it and I usually don't like
glitter in my highlights but it's
nothing like too extreme on the skin and
I think it is gorgeous and then the Ofra
pillow-talk this is really stunning as
well
Oprah's highlights do not come to play
they are very blinding beautiful
beautiful highlights and this one has
just like a tiny bit of pink in it as
well and I really really like that so oh
can you I mean hello these are so
gorgeous so this one here is the Ofra
pillow-talk it's so beautiful it's kind
of like icy but it has that little bit
of pink in it as well but again both of
these you do not need a lot of product
to get that boom on your cheekbones and
I think that they are absolutely
gorgeous I've also been really liking
both of these for an inner corner
highlight and to put on my brow bone as
a highlight as well again a simple eye
look but a nice bright lip color the
highlight and then also like
highlighting some more of the eye area
it's just like boom I love it so that is
going to do it for my summer essentials
