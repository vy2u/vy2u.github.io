today's video is going to be a summer
makeup declutter have been in desperate
need to start doing some more D clutters
again I've done D clutters in the past
and this video is going to be a little
bit different where is normally I was to
cluttering by like parts of my makeup
collection a lipstick declutter
foundation to Chloe or things like that
this is just going to be kind of a more
general makeup to clutter I'm also just
going to be showing the products like
sitting here on camera showing them
instead of like other declares in the
past where I lay everything out and they
kind of pick and choose but I'm going to
declutter I've already gone through my
collection and decluttered a few things
the reason I'm doing it this way is
because I've been working on organizing
and just kind of cleaning my office
space which is where my entire makeup
collection is I've been trying to find
some sort of organization with that I've
been doing a couple blogs on it that I
can leave a link down below and it's
through doing those that I have found
these products and I just kept setting
them aside like oh I know I don't really
want this so I like set it aside in a
different drawer and then it's just been
sitting there and I'm like what are you
doing get rid of that drawer get rid of
that space like free up more space and
then I thought I could make a declutter
video showing you all of the things that
I'm getting rid of so that is how we're
going to be doing this to clutter video
I hope that you guys like it I know it's
going to be a little bit different but
it really is just something that needs
to be done so what we jump in I just
want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video I am posting a
video every single day right now so if
you're interested in getting some daily
content I hope you'll consider being the
subscribe button also make sure to enter
my 20k giveaways for both Instagram and
YouTube they are going on right now so
those will be linked down below also but
if you'd like to see what makeup I am
getting rid of when I go ahead and get
this declutter started so I'm not really
going to go in any sort of a particular
order like I said I have everything from
brushes to foundations to nail polishes
and Vista clutter I just kind of was
going through everything in my office as
I've been trying to organize and pushing
things to the side that I know I just
don't need I am definitely a hoarder
100% does my personality I hate getting
rid of things I think it's because I
don't come from a lot you know what I'm
saying and like a lot of these things I
have purchased on my own and it's really
hard to be like I bought that now I'm
just going to give it away so like I
hold on to everything whether it be
makeup whether it be clothing or shoes
like I
things for a ridiculous amount of time
it's super hard for me to part with and
I think that's kind of like a really big
reason why but definitely hoarder status
but I know it's for the greater good to
do this declutter jumping into what I
have this from Maybelline it is their
master highlight highlighting bronzer I
mean I don't know this is so totally not
a bronzer on me it has like highlighting
shades in there I mean it's basically a
highlight I remember actually looking
for a blush this was in the blush
section then it says as a bronzer it's
basically a highlight it didn't really
make any sense to me it was really
really light on my face this is one of
the first drugstore products so that I
purchased when I was like starting to
try to build my collection and it was a
total bust for me which was a bummer but
I really have no problems getting rid of
this guy couple of like single shadows
here this one is from Maybelline it's
their 24-hour color tattoo I think the
shade is in leather so it was like a
purple shade I actually really love this
I got a lot of use out of it when I was
first getting into makeup as well I
would literally stick my finger in it
and put it all over my lid it was kind
of like a cream yeah like a cream
eyeshadow I would say I put it all over
my lid and like literally that would be
it it was purple which is good with
green eyes which is why I bought the
purple because I listened to make move
advice a lot when I was really getting
into buying makeup but I've just had it
for any probably over three years now it
probably just needs to be tossed and I
really don't reach for it anymore
anyways so this guy's going to go to I
have a single eyeshadow here this is
from Nomad cosmetics it's just an itty
bitty eyeshadow this is what it looks
like in the shade desert sands I believe
this came in like my very first itse bag
I think and while I think it's a nice
gold bronze shade I have this in palette
I have single shades of this I mean I
just I don't need it I think I used it
one time when I filmed my Ipsy bag
unboxing and like try things on and
that's really the only time because I
just I have so many others like this so
this can go couple of different mascaras
here at this one is from pixie beauty at
sea lower lash and mascara this was in
collaboration was this little Aspen over
maybe a little mascara and also a little
brow gel I actually basically use this
all up it's pretty much gone but it was
only point one one fluid
so it really didn't take me long to get
through the wand is like super super
tiny because it supposed to be like
specifically for your lower lashes I
used it quite a bit because I use false
lashes a lot so today is where I used
false lashes I would just use this on my
lower lashes so I used it all up
and I get the concept of it but my other
mascaras work just fine so I don't think
every purchased this but it is pretty
much gone I have a couple of mascaras
here that again are basically gone but
they've also been open for a really long
time and I know I just need to get rid
of them this one is the they're real
mascara from benefit one of my favorites
I have repurchased this I don't think I
have a full size of this right now but I
really love that mascara and what
totally revised this one is from blink
if their mascara amplified this is like
a tube mascara this came in a sephora
favorites one of their lashes - to go
I'm just not really a fan of two
mascaras I wouldn't repurchase this guy
like I said this one's not as out as
their real is but it's been open for a
really long time and it just needs to be
tossed so I haven't the eyeshadow
palette here from LA belladonna this is
their eyeshadow compact color and
despina I believe it is this is what it
looks like I've mentioned this recently
and eye makeup monthly I had to put it
in the failed category it's just not
very pigmented at all it just really
didn't do anything for me the colors
faded so fast they're out the day I
tried all the different colors and just
nothing really worked for me it's a cute
little compact and everything but I'm
never going to reach for it again so
it's kind of pointless for me to keep it
cluttering up my collection so this one
is going to be decluttered
this is kind of random but I found some
ardell lashes some of their wispy lashes
buried in my drawer when I was going
through it I recently talked about
Ardell in one of my videos makeup I
changed my mind about I think because I
so love ardell lashes and now I just
can't wear them I just do not like how
they look on me at all and I thought I
got rid of all of them but I randomly
found a pair so that's going to go to
just from NYX it's a jungle eye pencil
in milk I mean it's pretty much gone but
I've also had it for several several
years now like it just needs to go I
really do like this I do want to get
another one I used it as a base in a lot
I would use it as a white liner a lot I
thought it was really good this used to
be talked about a ton when I first
started my youtube channel like
everybody was using makes milk all the
time so I had to go out and buy it so
yeah this one it's almost gone and it's
definitely time to declare it as some of
our nation's here as well that I'm just
going to go ahead and declutter I
recently did post a best and worst
drugstore foundation video if you guys
want to check that one out
and I really was kind of hanging on to
these because I knew I was going to film
that video and I knew that these would
be mentioned in there and that was
really the only reason I was hanging
onto these because I just do not reach
for these foundations at all the first
one is from Bronx colors it's their HGTV
foundation I just did not get on with
this from the moment that I try to get
into it like too much stuff since I have
a whole video on them but this one just
never worked out for me and I just don't
like it at all the other ones are from
Maybelline these two are from their
regular fit me line like the regular
original semi line and this one is from
the mountain poreless line again I just
don't like the way they look on my skin
I think they're too heavy they're just
not my favorites I do not reach for
these guys at all they're still products
left and all for these foundations that
I'm talking about these guys also I've
had them for over two years probably so
they just need to be the clutters of
these four foundations these guys are
going to go feel like when it comes to
makeup brushes you can tell that I have
hoarder status really really bad I have
this spinner behind me right here and if
you watch the vlogs you probably seem
like closer ups of the spinner and on
top I had a ton of makeup brushes a
couple of like makeup brush organization
for was it my birthday I think maybe
from my mom and so I went through and I
was organizing my brushes and I kind of
will organize them like brushes that I
use a ton and impressions I don't use as
much and even though I have a huge
makeup brush collection I still took the
makeup brushes but I basically never use
I even don't use that much and I put
them in the spinner why why did I not
just get rid of them I don't know so I'm
finally getting rid of these brushes
because I have I cannot remember the
last time I used these brushes I use
everything that is on my bookshelf in
their little storage organization over
there
Karin or the last time I touched it but
I still hold on to them because I have a
problem I don't know what to do about it
but a lot of these are from BH Cosmetics
like these are all BH Cosmetics
this is BH Cosmetics BH Cosmetics
nothing against BH Cosmetics
it's just when I was first getting into
makeup before I even had a channel I
bought like two different sets they
comment these really large sets I
purchased two different ones with those
not the same time inside different times
but I purchased two of them and that's
kind of what this start at my makeup
brush collection and again nothing I
guess them because I thought they worked
great especially as a beginner when I
was just learning
like what brushes work best for what I
really gravitated towards them a lot
because they were super affordable some
cents instead of spending a lot of money
on a brush that like I didn't get or I
don't know how to use or whatever it
like going to be a trout was definitely
much better for me but now that I have
found some of the you know makeup brush
brands that I really really love I just
don't reach for them anymore so I know I
can get rid of them you guys want to see
my favorite makeup brushes my current
favorite makeup brushes let me know I
have that on my list of film so I'd love
to know if you guys are interested in
that then I just have two more brushes
here this one is from ELF
it's a smudge brush that I don't know
the last time I used and this one is
from crown brushes I think I got this in
a subscription bag but again I have like
four or five other brushes that look
exactly like this so I just do not need
these anymore I took them out of my
spinner I'm working on you know
organizing everything behind me of the
desk behind me the spinners behind me
everything and these are just sitting
there doing absolutely nothing so these
are being too cluttered these can go
have another foundation here this is
from gorgeous cosmetics it's their base
perfect liquid foundation in the shade
3n this really just was not a good shade
match for me it was really really yellow
on my skin it also has a scent that I
did not love I don't think it's a bad
foundation like the way that I will look
down my face like I like the finish of
it but I just didn't like the smell and
just the color just does not work for me
and I would have to do like a lot with
like powder and concealer and bronzer to
make it all kind of come together on my
face so I decided I'm going to go ahead
and pass this along I don't think that
it needs to be like thrown out because
it's very new to mean I've only used it
a handful of times but I'm just going to
find someone to be able to pass this
along to four items said I'm just going
to pass along because they are not in my
shade these are from and number seven
these are both concealers there's a
radiant glow concealer
they sent me three different shades in
my shade
is in 10 and these just do not work for
me at all shades 30 and 61 or I think
they are both too dark for me if I
remember
all I did was swatch these some of the
passes along as well because they are
new and I mean they've never even been
on my face or anything like that so I'm
going to pass these a log these are such
a good concealer I love this concealer
another concealer I have this is from
L'Oreal it's the true match cram super
blendable crayon concealer this is what
it looks like this I bought I mean
there's still a lot of product left you
just kind of like push it up there's
still a lot of product left in there but
I have this for probably at least three
years if not more this is one of the
first concealers I bought when I was
like starting a makeup collection as
well and I just do not reach for it
anymore again it's really yellow on my
skin it just isn't the best shade match
and what I found myself eventually using
it for when I got concealers that I
actually did like is I would have it be
a base for my eyeshadows and I thought
it was just fine but it was probably a
couple months ago I was doing that and I
thought like this is really dried out
like it just kind of like flaked on my
lids oh this is so old it just needs to
be thrown away
well sample guy here from Too Faced this
is their shadow insurance like an
eyeshadow primer I mean it's just a
sample of it and there's I don't know
maybe like two uses left but I've had it
for so long and it just needs to go and
I don't know I thought it was okay but
it's not something that I would
repurchase but again like something so
tiny I know it's not like totally
cluttering up my collection but still
like why do I hold on to things like
this why this drama Maybelline this is a
brow drama sculpting brow mascara and I
got mine in the shade blonde I bought
this when I was first going to try to
learn how to do my brows like after I
started my channel and everybody was
like you don't fill in your eyebrows
what is wrong with you I would now above
this from Maybelline basically it's just
a mascara for your brows link does have
like a brow fiber which is similar to
the benefit gimme brow would actually
which actually like gives your brows
like the illusion of an oomph because
that has the fibers in it so so
literally it's just like a tinted
mascara for your brows basically but
honestly like it's pretty close to being
finished because I use this all the time
like when I first start seeing the
comments on my brows this is what I
would use every single day it doesn't
really do anything it kind of just makes
them look a little bit more polished and
maybe like a little bit darker that's
about it so I mean it's not much
I'm not going to like repurchase it or
anything but again I'm kind of impressed
by how much of it is used but it
seriously I use this a lot but it just
needs to go I don't use it anymore we
can move on so if you don't know this
about me I'm actually a nail polish
attic I do get my nails done at a salon
I don't like acrylics put on and filled
at the salon but I tell them not to
paint them there because I like to paint
them at home I simply like to paint my
nails a lot of people are like oh you
can take in your own nail polish I'm
like yes but I like to pin my nails I
don't know why I don't know what it is
but I just enjoy painting my nails I
enjoy doing it and it doesn't bother me
and I also love to change my nail polish
color like if I could if I had the time
I think I would change my nail polish
like every two days as it is I probably
changed my polish at least once a week
maybe even every five days but I have a
huge nail polish collection well just
kind of like a nail polish addict it's
so hard for me to go to the store like
especially like a CVS or Target and not
come back with a nail polish it's a
serious thickness but I realized that my
nail polish collection was getting a
little bit out of hand so I went through
it and was able to grab out five up here
that I can declutter these two are just
so freakin old I don't even know how old
these are these are from Sally Hansen C
hard as nails extreme wears we have a
pink and a mint again I have these for
so long so the shades are coral reef and
then mint sorbet but you can't tell
which one is wait a chomp by those names
again just so many years it's kind of
ridiculous those can go
I have other nail polishes like that
shade in my collection these also are
from Sally Hansen these are the integer
eyes I remember buying these when I
lived in at my condo with my husband and
we've been in this house now for over
four years
so these nail polishes are also super
old we have a leap in my lack and set
sail again but you can't tell which
based on the names but these two guys
can go again I have nail polishes that
were added to my collection more
recently that looks just like the purple
and the blue this one is more recent to
me this is from Essie it is a treat love
and color strength Center or shade name
is sheers to you so it is a very very
sheer polish I got this in one of my
subscription bikes too and I was
actually excited about it because
sometimes I like to put just the tiniest
hint of color on
my nails like court almost looks like
I'm not wearing nail polish because I
really really liked that trend so when I
got this I was like that's going to be
perfect I just did not like it it's not
even like a gift you a shear tint of
color it almost just makes your nails
iridescent I don't know it was weird
I didn't like it it didn't work out for
me I know it's supposed to be like a
strength Center for nails
I have acrylic that doesn't matter to me
so I don't know I just I did not like
the way that this looked this is a new
are nail polish so and it's only been
used a couple of times so I'm just going
to pass this guy along I am I'll finish
the lefty products here at this one is
from NYX it's their crystal silk glitter
liner so this is what it looks like
again I bought this a long time ago when
people are like using glitter I was like
I need to use glitter too
I bought it but it burns my eyes I think
that I have some sort of like eye
sensitivity because when I use a lot of
glitters they burn my eyes so bad this
is with a little wand looks like I tried
and tried over and over again to use
this because it was affordable it was
mixed it was glitter I mean it looked
nice on the eyes but I just I could not
do it I know I need to get rid of those
it just hurts too bad to keep in my
collection
clay I have some eyeshadow palettes this
one is from unique it is their mood
stroke addiction pellet I think it was
called kind of it has a name I think
they had like three different palettes
you could choose from I had a friend who
sold unique and when I first started my
channel she asked if she could send me a
few products so I'm going to go ahead
and declutter this eyeshadow palette
though because I just do not reach for
it a lot I didn't mind the shades in
there obviously I picked out with a very
neutral palette of course even back in
the day I picked out the neutral palette
but I just don't really reach for it
they're not super pigmented they're like
even the shimmers are pretty light and I
just I just don't reach for it enough to
keep it in my collection so I'm going to
go ahead and declutter this unique
palette the last palette I have to just
clutter is actually from Too Faced this
is called their pixie pinup so in one of
my videos I think maybe it was the
makeup I've changed my mind about I can
talked about two phases of brand I also
talked about how I used to be a product
reviewer for the Too Faced when they
were first kind of starting out featured
a lot of Beauty reviews on my blog which
is chiclet less comments still running
it's mostly just the book blog now and I
do the beauty side of things here on
YouTube but they used to be
find and I was a product reviewer from
two-faced they used to send me items in
like early stages for me to review on a
variety of different products how the
product works how the product looks
things like that and then they would
enter us like when we would review
things for them they would enter us into
contest and this was actually one of the
items that I won was at six different
shades I think it came with a mascara
this was an eyeliner and then it also
came with a brush I mean you can see
that I love this shades look like
hardcore it was called leading lady I
used that shade all the time I would
literally just put it all over I call it
a day I remember when I won this palette
I was so excited I was so cute I was
just I was so pleased to win something
so I'm like one of those that I don't
normally win anything you know so I was
super excited to win this one again I
have had this for several several years
it's kind of like one of those like
nostalgia things but I think maybe I was
keeping it for awhile but you know I'm
not really on board with Too Faced now
so I'm like I can just go ahead and
declutter this I came over the last time
I use these shadows this one's going to
go but I thought that one is pretty
funny so the pixie kind of sum to face
is also going to be declared again so
that's going to do it for my summer
makeup declutter video let me know what
you guys thought of this video if you
like this way of declutter or if you
would prefer more kind of like the
typical declutter videos where I'm going
buy my makeup collection I think the
most recent declutter video I did was a
lipstick declutter and I don't even
think it was that long ago
so I'll have that linked in the
description box down below so you don't
see me lipsticks in here because I know
I did that one fairly recently but let
me know if you like this style I can
kind of put these in every once in a
while or if you would only want to see
be more traditional to clutters just let
me know your thoughts let me know what
you thought about the makeup that I'm
getting rid of I'm kind of hoping this
is a good step of getting back on track
to organizing my office and makeup
collection and just kind of giving
things in a better shape around here so
these are items that have just been kind
of cluttering everything up a lot of
items can just be tossed but I'm excited
to pass along a few as well but if you
guys did enjoy this summer makeup
declutter I hope that you will get this
video a thumbs up I hope that you also
consider subscribing before you go now
I'll teach you guys real soon in my next
one right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
