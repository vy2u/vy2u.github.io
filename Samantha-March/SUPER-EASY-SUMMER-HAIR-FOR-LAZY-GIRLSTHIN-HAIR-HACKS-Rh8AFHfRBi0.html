I'm really excited for today's video
because it's going to be my three go to
summer hairstyles for lazy girls for
girls who don't know how to do hair
hashtag me and it's also going to
include a few hair hacks for girls who
have thin hair like me now you might be
looking at my hair right now being like
that does not look like thin hair
because this is actually a style and a
hack that is featured in the video I was
really excited to do this because I had
started to get more requests for people
not only to do hack videos and hack
videos are like super popular right now
if you don't know i just did I like how
to start a YouTube channel featuring a
bunch of hacks and i will leave a link
below but people were also asking for
more hacks then also for hair videos and
I'm like I don't know how to do hair
like truly I don't know how to do hair I
just in the past two to three months I
would say I learned how to French braid
and it was because I would not stop
practicing I was watching every video
out there i was having mirrors like
surrounding me i was having like my
husband look over me like it took me so
long to figure it out and so when the
french braids started coming in trend i
was like oh man i make you french braids
how am I gonna get it and I just
practice and practice and practice and I
learned but seriously it's still not
great yet I still have a lot of ways to
go I don't know how to fishtail braid I
don't know how to Dutch braid I mean I
just I don't know how to do hair I don't
know how to tease my hair I don't know
how to style hair I just don't know what
to do so these are definitely hairstyles
for girls who don't really know how to
do hair yet but you want a few like easy
go-to styles they're also good for lazy
girls like me because it's like after I
finished doing my makeup the last thing
that I want to do is focus on my hair I
just don't want to do it so these are
also for you and then of course I do
include each hairstyle that I do has a
hack to go along with it so hopefully if
you guys have thinner hair be able to
pick up a few different tips and tricks
for me because thin hair is just like my
nemesis and I just hate it so much no
matter how long my hair gets it doesn't
matter the length it's still always very
thin and it's like
constant struggle that i have so i hope
some of these hacks really help you out
but i'm excited to share what I come up
with I also hopped in the good ole
shower for you guys for this video and
that was super awkward to film so I hope
you will give this video a thumbs up
because I'm really trying to push myself
to be more creative in my videos and to
go outside my comfort zone and that was
definitely very strange so I hope you do
enjoy my hacks please do leave in the
comments below which one you enjoyed the
most or if you have any hair hacks for
thin hair thick hair lazy girl summer
day hair any sort of hair hacks or tips
or styles that you guys love the most
please do leave them in the comments
below because of course I would love to
check them out because i watch hair
videos all the time because I just want
to learn how to do hair canal let's hop
over to my ex hi guys but I have french
braids I love them they're easy to do
but look at how thin my braids are no so
my heck is what I do after I take a
shower I usually shower at night I both
French braid my hair and go to sleep on
it and then when I wake up this is what
my braids look like so what I do is I
take the braids out the next day and you
are left with this like crazy kinky
looking hair yes girl and then what I do
is I simply rebe raid the french braids
so first I'll brush up my hair and yes I
am using a claw clip because I forgot to
bring down a hairbrush but I brush out
my hair and I'm not going to go into
detail of how I French braid because you
can probably see that I'm very much
still a beginner and still learning so I
can't really walk you through the
process yet but what I've learned with
the French braiding is you really want
to make sure you don't have any tangles
in your hair and so I always brush my
hair out really good before I French
braid just to try to make it easier on
me and I also think rushing through it
makes the hair a little bit more fluffy
but when you French braid over this like
kind of kinked hair it definitely makes
the braids a little bit thicker so I'm
still getting the hair style that I like
but you can tell even right here that
the braid is thicker than from one I
just braided it after showering and
going to sleep and then also what I do
is I pull out the braids and this will
also give the illusion of a thicker
looking braid and then I just simply do
the same thing on the other side but
then I have french braids that I we're
in my hair for two to three days and
it's super easy but they look a little
bit
thicker when so I feel like of course
you guys know that I was going to do the
top knot I love the top not I'm
constantly wearing it but when I first
started doing the top knot I was like
why does my top not look so tiny like it
looked weird so what I learned is that
not only do I grab hair from the front
but I also need to pick up a large
section from the back so I just grab a
section of hair right underneath the
front part where I grabbed it and then I
will twist that hair and then when I'm
tying it I essentially make two buns on
the top of my head and you can see right
here I only pull it through halfway and
then I have these two buns and I'll pull
out the hair there to make it thicker
and then I'll pull out the front bun to
make it thicker as well so I've
essentially made to top knots on the top
of my head but it helps make it look a
little bit thicker and then I also pull
out the hair in the front to give that
illusion as well and voila my easy top
not so this last hairstyle is one that I
get asked so many questions about it's
actually what you saw in the intro and
it's how i get this curly hair people
ask me so many questions about it so the
most important thing that I have learned
I've been doing this hairstyle since
high school is that I skip the
conditioner I will only shampoo my hair
so you saw in the earlier clip held up
my shampoo and conditioner take the
conditioner away and I only shampoo my
hair and then once I get out of the
shower i will just part my hair where I
want it to be parted and then I will
grab most this one is just from garnier
fructis but I have a lot of different
moose and then I scrunch my hair this
hair style is what I call my scrunch
style I just call it my scrunchie hair
so i will scrunch the moves throughout
my hair i'll flip my head over and make
sure i get the back as well and that is
all I do I don't blow dry it I don't do
anything I just let it air dry and I
have this curly hair that you see here I
get asked so many questions of how I
accomplished this hair what curling iron
i'm using and there is none of it skip
the conditioner and go with mousse and
we have beautiful curly thicker looking
hair and those are all hope you enjoyed
guys
little thing people now
