today's video is going to be all about a
sweat-proof makeup I am going to be
applying some makeup to my face here on
camera that says that these are
waterproof are like all-day wear long
lasting things like that I'm going to
apply it with some tips that I have
picked up from other youtubers and then
we are actually going to put this makeup
to the test I'm filming this on a
Tuesday which means I go to my sand
volleyball league tonight I play at 6:45
and I checked the weather at the time
predicted at 6:45 is 89 degrees and when
we playing sand volleyball and I'm going
to be playing it in a full face of
makeup because I want to see what holds
up what lasts so I'm going to apply
everything right now it's about 1
o'clock in the afternoon and then I will
check back in with you probably between
8 &amp;amp; 9 o'clock tonight when I get home
from volleyball and we are going to see
what actually held up what actually is
the wet proof because I'm very curious
myself and I want to know what is what
Pro Simmons crazy Iowa heat that we are
having so where we get started I don't
want to say thank you guys so much for
clicking on this video if you haven't
subscribed yet I hope that you will
consider subscribing because I am
posting a video every single day so if
you enjoy daily content you will get
that over here from me
I do have 20k giveaways going on right
now for Instagram and YouTube so those
will be a link down below but this has
been a very requested video so why don't
we go ahead and test out some sweat
proof waterproof makeup all right so
I've got my ears on and like I said this
video has been really requested and I
kind of I wasn't going to do it at first
because I'm like well I don't know you
know I'm not a makeup artist and I say
that a lot I don't have a ton of like
makeup tips and tricks to share and I
really don't feel like I've ever liked
solidly put my makeup to the test and
like took notes and documented how it
lasted so I'm like I would not feel
confident making a video that's like
this is my sweat proof makeup routine
these are the products you should use if
you want water proof because I don't
know so that video would just be all
lies
so I'm like well I can't make that video
that's not going to work what should I
do one idea to kind of put it to the
test actually came to me when I was
looking over the weekend I was looking
the weather in Iowa for the week and I
saw it's supposed to be in the upper 90s
I think on Thursday it is saying 100
degrees and I thought I should film this
video on a Tuesday and then cook played
volleyball in my full face of makeup and
the tips that I saw when watching a
bunch of like sweat-proof wire because
makeup videos as they say to use a
mattifying primer which totally makes
sense you want to mattify your face the
only mattifying primer that I own is the
Milani Prime shield it's their
mattifying and pore minimizing primer
literally everything else I have is
either like a smoothing primer or like
an illuminating primer so I mean clearly
you can tell what it is that I like to
look like so I'm just going to first
prime my face this is obviously a really
important step for making your makeup
last longer is using a primer excited to
see how this video turns out I mean I
really have no idea how it's going to go
I have no idea how I'm going to look
when I'm playing volleyball I'm not
going to do any sort of like touch-ups
or anything throughout the day
definitely excited to see the end result
Kooks who knows what it's going to look
like a foundation that I grabbed out is
the Tarte rainforest of the sea water
foundation this is what it looks like I
wear this quite a bit and I really do
like it feel like this foundation is
super super long lasting I've worn it a
lot I've worn it out a lot I'm just
going to put some on my L'Oreal bunch
here didn't say on here that it was
waterproof but I was watching Tarte on
snapchat not too long ago and the gal
was applying it and she made a comment
that it was waterproof and also when I
gold waterproof foundations like in the
Google search this one popped up so I'm
like I don't know I might take it I kind
of thought maybe I couldn't do this
video because a few days ago I was going
through my collection and like looking
everything over and I didn't have a lot
of things that specifically said right
on their waterproof s'en when I was
watching other people's videos you know
not everything they use specifically
States waterproof a lot of the items
that they pull say like long wearing all
day wear 24 hour wear things like that
so then I went back to my makeup
collection and I was like okay no I
think I can do this video and then for
foundation what some people were saying
is that you can ask just you know a
little bit more foundation like kind of
like build it up the Tarte foundation to
me is more of like medium to full so I'm
just gonna
add a little bit more to build on that
to make it more of a fuller coverage
Foundation and st. John I've been
watching a lot of people's videos I feel
like I've got a few good tricks in there
and some of the tips too are things that
like I actually just did on my own which
kind of made me excited of like maybe I
do know a little something about this
for concealer I'm going to use the
heart-shaped Cape I've noticed a lot of
people using this one as well and go
ahead and apply this on my under eyes
again maybe using a little bit more than
I normally would and I'm also going to
apply some to my eyelids because the eye
look that I'm going to do is pretty
simple and so as I'm doing my face first
and the face is really like one of the
more important things when it comes to
like sweat proof is your base you know
and when I do face first and then eyes I
typically don't use an eye primer I'll
just use whatever concealer does I'm
wearing I actually really like using
concealers as eye primers they do work
really well for me I'm just going to
blend this in with these same L'Oreal
sponge and then of course in everybody's
video one of the best tips for a
long-lasting makeup is to bake your face
especially your under eye concealer but
I'm going to do a little bit more than
that so I'm going to use the tarte
smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing
powder so I'm just going to get some on
my Beauty Blender and then apply this to
my under eyes once I have it like spread
out I'm really going to like take my
Beauty sponge and press this in instead
of just like lightly pouncing we're
really press this in here I saw a lot of
people doing this in their videos to
help with the long wear of it and then
I'm just going to take what's left over
on my sponge and kind of press it into
the other areas where I put the
concealer I am going to let this sit and
bake for a few minutes because I don't
like to put like the loose powder all
over my face I'm going to grab out my
pr4 in one press mineral powder is in
the shade tan and this is a brush from
Real Techniques it is the expert face
brush I'm just going to get a little
product on here and then again press
this brush into the areas where I don't
have the baking powder again powder over
with a liquid or cream should help to
set everything keep it in place and keep
it long lasting I don't normally set my
liquid foundation with a powder I know a
lot of people do it's just a step that I
typically find myself not meeting so I
don't do it a ton but if I know that I'm
going to be out all day or somewhere
where I do need long-lasting makeup this
is a tip that I will do like when I was
in a wedding recently is use a liquid
foundation and then I did set everything
with a powder foundation and I thought
the results are pretty good so after
about five minutes or so I'm going into
dust away the powder and hopefully my
concealer will be left in place all day
even though I'm spiking the volleyball
and after I wipe I oughta powder I'm
gonna come in with bronzer I'm going to
use this one from cargo it is their
swimmable water resistant bronzer so
that is why I chose this one I did just
use this recently in a get writing with
me and I actually liked it quite a bit
so I'm just going to apply this with my
Sigma large powder the f30 brush and we
will see how water reason synthesis that
I am sweating like crazy I got your
bronzer I'm going to go in with a blush
I'm going to use Part II Part A from the
Tarte it's one of their Amazonian clay
blushes it says it's a 12 hour blush I
just have a little mini go X that came
in lycosa for our birthday set I'm going
to use one of the brushes from the
target unicorn make believe in yourself
collection so then I didn't think I had
any blushes that said they were
specifically waterproof so I just went
for the one that said it was like the
long lasting 12-hour wear so you will
see how it does but for brows I really
didn't have much to play around with
because I basically only used the
benefit brows to do this off camera
again I don't I mean these don't say
that they're like long-lasting or
waterproof or anything like that but
it's really the only option I have for
my brow so I'm going to do I'm going to
use the goof proof pencil this is in the
shade three and then I am going to set
them with the Ready Set brow it should
say clear brow gel I do this off camera
and then we're going to come in and
start on the eye look okay so browser on
I went a little bit bolder because you
know I really never have any idea what
I'm doing with my brows and I just come
out the way they come out put a move on
to eyes I'm going to use these L'Oreal
infallible shadows because when I
Goldfarb proof eyeshadows these did come
up they are supposed to be like
incredibly long wearing eye shadows so I
have one for all over my lid one for
like brow bone and inner corner
highlight now the one I'm going to put
all over the lid is the amber brush
which is a really nice like bronze
shimmer and I really wanted to put
something in my crease like getting
anxiety when I do my shadow in my crease
you know not anything overly dramatic or
anything but I couldn't figure out what
else I was going to throw my eyeshadows
off like I don't know what else is
supposed to be really long wearing so
I'm going to use my brown Stern the
cargo bronzer there's been so many times
where I have used like a bronzer or
contour shade on my eyes as well and I
think they work just fine so I'm just
going to use my Sigma e-40 pick up a
little bit of the bronzer and then I'm
just going to dust this into my crease
this does like just a little bit of a
shimmer to it nothing like super
overpowering but still like I just
needed some sort of crease color for my
eyes I just need to did then I'm going
to grab the shade amber rush it is such
a beautiful bronze shimmer and I just
think it is so beautiful I'm going to
use my sigma e55 brush medium sweeper
are going to spray it a bit with my mac
fix+
and I'm just going to apply this all
over the lid how beautiful - the Jade
the L'Oreal infallible shadows were like
some of my old school colors I bought
these I think when I first started my
channel or maybe even a little bit
before because a lot of people would put
these in their tutorials or
recommendations videos so I went out and
bought two shades and then actually
amber rush was said to be from
subscribers we're just so amazing
because everyone always recommend it
amber rush but I never got it so oh that
is so so pretty I'm excited to see what
holds up and like really put things to
the test here because I'm going to the
Iowa State Fair in a couple of weeks
when it starts and I think it's going to
be like kind of an all day - all night
thing and it's probably going to be
really hot it always is I know we have a
couple of like
overnight like camping trips coming up -
so it's going to be good to see what
holds up and I know we're going on a
float trip and that's that I'm not
someone to like where is a ton of makeup
like doing outdoorsy things like that
but it's always nice to know like can I
find a good concealer that holds up or
even just like one eyeshadow that would
look nice throughout the day that's just
kind of like be put together a little
bit more so I'm excited for this video
I'm excited to see how I look like
tonight hopefully it's not too crazy so
amber brushes applies make sure I don't
have any harsh lines or anything I'm not
going to do any cap liner just because I
am NOT going to wear lashes I'm just
going to do I have some 24 hour mascara
that I want to test out and normally if
I don't want to lashes like I don't do
top liner sometimes when I do lashes I
don't do help I learn anyways but for
the most part if I'm just doing mascara
a lot of times I will not do liner and I
think it's because a small wing to me I
just can't physically do like it's
always really large and so when I can't
balance it out with my lashes I just
think it looks kind of strange so we're
not going to do any top liner but I am
going to put some liner in my waterline
that we are going to use one of the Marc
Jacobs highliners this is in the shade
Odyssey it is a teal blue that it would
be fun was at this bronzy look but these
I think are super super long-lasting so
I am very excited to actually put it to
the test in put it to the test on camera
here I'm going to go ahead and play this
in my waterline add that to my waterline
and then a little bit to the lower lash
line as well and I think that's all I'm
going to do for there like the way that
that looks our brow bone and inner
corner highlight I'm going to use
another L'Oreal infallible shadow this
is in ice flat a one of the first
infallible shadows that I bought and I
use my morphe 18 like always and just
highlight the brow bone and also put
some in the inner corner and for mascara
that I'm Catrice it's the rocket or
extreme Volume Mascara it does say that
is 24-hour
and I believe it said on the bus and I
opened it that it was waterproof I think
that's what it said even though I don't
see it on here
but when it says 24-hour wear that's me
means
sweat proof so we're going to go ahead
and give it a try I did use this in a
recent get ready with me I'll link it
down below and I've actually been really
liking this mascara I keep reaching for
it not only because I'm trying to you
know review it and get a good thought on
it so because I actually really do like
it but I simply I'm going to move on to
highlighter I saw a lot of people
recommending this tip and it's something
that I have been to if I really want my
highlighter to stay all day it is going
in first with like a liquid or a cream
highlight and then setting that with a
powder on top basically the same idea of
what we did with the foundation and the
concealer you go in with a liquid force
and you set it with a powder so for them
to go in with the Marc Jacobs dewdrops
love these so much and I use the
smallest amount so this could go through
like five generations of my family
hopefully even more it's ridiculous how
little you need for a beautiful
highlight and I like to just take a
little bit on my finger and just go from
there I always have to be careful those
that has a pump and whenever I pump it
out like sometimes I use too much okay
so like seriously do you see that on my
ring finger that is the amount I'm using
for both sides of my cheeks okay so I'm
just going to lightly tap it and then
come over on the other side and tap the
rest in and then I'm just going to go
back and I just tap it in with my
fingers like look it look at that it's
crazy like it's crazy what this
highlight is so I just tap it in with my
finger sometimes I'll use like a duo
fiber brush if I really want to but a
lot of times with a liquid or cream
highlight I just use my finger then to
top that I'm going to go into my Becca
and Jacqueline hello face palette I'm
going to use a champagne pop one of my
favorite highlights this one over here
we use a champagne pop over top at Marc
Jacobs highlight using my luck C 520 to
highlight brush oh yes I used this
combination recently and I was obsessed
with it look if you need to find me on
the volleyball court like you'll know
whoo that is a glow
now that we're all highlighted up I'm
going to finish with a lip combination
again I've seen this as a tip and it's
something that I do myself as well
especially if I know I'm going to be out
for a long time like specifically I go
to a lot of concerts I'm going to a
concert I will line my lips and fill
them in with a lip liner and then top
them with a liquid lipstick this is the
best way to get really long-lasting
lipstick and if your liquid lipstick
does start to wear away after a while
which it does have the lip liner there
that can kind of help conceal the fact
that your lipstick is fading away so I'm
using both products from Oprah I'm just
going to line my lips with their liner
in silk I'm also going to use that lip
liner and just fill in my lips and to
tap that I'm going to use the Oprah it
says right on here along electing the
liquid lipstick this is in the shade
spell layer I got this and the Oprah in
the news trio I believe it was called
but these are also sold separately on
the Oprah website and then also now at
Ulta Beauty so I'm just going to go
ahead and fill in my lips with this so I
am going to apply two coats
okay so liquid lipstick is applied and
of course the final step is going to be
to spray your face with a setting spray
just going to use Google Messick's plus
for this I'm just going to go ahead and
spray my face and luck everything into
place
and then this is a tip that I learned
from a nikkietutorials after you spray
your face you're supposed to then stay
on yourself and miss using posted notes
because I have posted notes all over the
place I'm just going to spray my face
because she says that she learned from
some makeup artist that this is how
everything will lock into place as well
and so once our face is sprayed and then
appropriately fanned this is going to be
the final look so it's now almost 2
o'clock I play volleyball at 6:45 I will
pop back on after volleyball anyhow
everything held up throughout the day
and in 90-degree heat playing volleyball
because this will really put sweat-proof
to the test I wanted to do it this way
versus some other waterproof videos for
people like get in the shower because to
me that's not
realistic I don't typically do my makeup
like this and then be like guys I'm
gonna hit the shower and then I'll be
right back because I don't know but best
we doesn't scream super realistic I get
it like funny to watch and stuff but I'm
more of a realistic kind of real gal
over here so that's why we are going to
do it this way but I'm excited to see
what holds up and what doesn't so I know
as I continue along in this crazy Iowa
heat that highlight is no joke so we go
get ready for my youtube live now that
I'm going to be popping on in a few
hours to do and then I will see you guys
after volleyball peace hey honey I am
back so it is 8:30 on the dot I just got
done playing volleyball and then we did
next drive home which is about a
30-minute drive but this is what it
looks like I'll see you guys in in a
second here and show you but honestly I
am so impressed with everything on my
face like so impressed this is what
proof Mikko routine is getting a thumbs
up from this girl because I think
everything held up really well is
nothing is like looking back on me and
at one point as we're standing on the
volleyball courts there's like a certain
corner where it was just the Sun was
just full on you and I have that moment
in my mind regicide I'm melting I'm
actually melting but everything is still
looking good okay let me zoom you give
me in on my face it is nighttime
obviously now so I just have my ring
light going I did send up set up any
other lighting so just got my ring light
but like seriously even the brows which
the benefit goof proof doesn't even say
that it's like waterproof or anything is
that I know of but they are holding on
really well look at this Marc Jacobs
eyeliner still hanging around I mean I
have said that they are super
long-lasting and they are super
long-lasting look at the eyeshadows
still holding up really well the
highlight don't know if you guys can see
it but it looks great the foundation
held up so well like it doesn't look it
nope my concealer can you tell concealer
is still hanging around there is like no
creasing I am just all sorts of
impressed and then this
six I haven't eaten dinner dinner yet
but I did have a bag of Jimmy John's
potato chips on the way there just to
have something in my stomach before we
left and a look at this lipstick no
touch-ups that is the Oprah Bel Air
I am super impressed like it kind of
started to throw it away just in the
middle but honestly not even anything
more like I could tell so the Oprah silk
liner and the ultra Bel Air lipstick
like seriously threw a bag of salty
potato chips that's pretty freakin good
you guys I'm going to have to give it to
the slip proof routine like this is
pretty friggin amazing to me so I'm
going to have to go ahead and give this
is what proof and makeup routine two
thumbs up I think it lasted so well
throughout the heat throughout playing
volleyball the blush still looks really
nice the blonds are still looks really
nice my eye shadows like having that
budge
I'm surprised honestly the mascara I
mean hello we didn't even talk about the
mascara there is no mascara on me there
is no mascara on my face it is all on my
lashes still like I'm just I'm I'm shaft
I'm honestly shocked I really didn't
know how this would last but I hope that
you guys found is helpful of course

listed and linked down below these I'll
give my approval first what proof makeup
routine I tried to implement some tricks
that I know and some tips and tricks
that I have seen in other people's
waterproof sweat proof makeup videos and
