today's video I'm going to be doing a
beauty haul I have a few things from
like Sephora and alta to show you I have
an influencer voxbox to share with and
just a few goodies like that so if you
would like to see my most recent beauty
haul and what I have gotten please keep
watching a few things from Ulta so i
will go over that first I think that I
got that I'm really excited to try an
avid meeting to get it for so long is
this garnier fructis texture tease it's
a dry touch finishing spray been seeing
a few people use like these finishing
sprays versus using like a hairspray and
I was just really curious about it the
texture tease is supposed to give like
limp or flat hair more texture more
volume things like that and that's
something that I struggle with a lot of
times my hair is just like very flat in
the limp so I thought this would could
be something kind of cool it says
longing for tousled Airy fullness for a
textured windblown look texture tease as
a dry touch finished right that holds a
lift and fullness on shapeless hair it
holds textured style all day it gives
the finished that is non tacky not stiff
or weighted down yurius to try this one
I basically all I did so far was like
spray at once just so I could kind of
like see what the spray was like kind of
reminded me of like a dry shampoo kind
of the way it came out dry shampoo is
kind of like very like when you pull it
out at the bowl okay and that's kind of
what it reminded me of some curious is
it going to be like a dry shampoo is it
going I don't know curious curious very
curious about this one if anyone has
tried it please let me know and I will
give my thoughts in the next few weeks
but another thing I grabbed because I
talked about how much i bought a similar
product to it and hated it and it was
then was at a haul video or make a video
don't remember no it was my beauty
essentials video my summer beauty
essentials and I talked about like the
love of the Beauty Blender but I had
gotten like a cheap knockoff from
walgreens thinking that all would be
fine and it was like the worst beauty
blunder of life so I mentioned that I
might pick up the Real Techniques
blender that they have at Ulta and I did
just that so this is what the packaging
looks
like I've already used the beauty
blender but i kept the packaging so i
could show you guys what it looks like
the back it says it's a 3 in wine that
it has a flat edge to contour around the
eyes and nose the sides to blend large
areas of the face and then the tip to
cover imperfections so it's orange and
it's pretty large this is what it looks
like I used it today I just squeezed in
him is still kind of damp I just used it
today so it's a little bit dirty but
that's what it looks like so yeah you
can see there's like this side angled
edge there's the tip on the other side
and then this your regular sponge I've
used it so far I of course like it more
than what i got from walgreens I like it
one thing that I've noticed is that so
with my first Beauty Blender that I had
which also it wasn't a Beauty Blender it
was another knock off brand that I think
I got at target but I really liked it
with this one it's like when I get it
wet and then I squeeze it out because
you don't want like a soaking wet Beauty
Blender you want it to be damned so I
squeezed it out but then it's almost
like it's not damp any more and I have
to keep rewetting it in order to make
sure that it's still damp and is
actually blending out my makeup that's
about the only thing I've noticed so far
I do really like this edge this like
flat angled and I really like it for
like under my eyes I've been using that
side a lot if you can tell because it's
like super dirty but you have so far
I've used it a few times and I'm really
happy with it so these are at Ulta it's
the Real Techniques Beauty Blender okay
I also i ran out of my liquid eyeliner a
few weeks back and i've been wanting to
get a new one wanting to get a new one
and i was at Ulta and strolling through
and I picked up this Maybelline master
graphic by I studio it's their liquid
eyeliner that's what the packaging looks
like but let me pull off the cap for you
so you can see this like whoa you guys
see that it's like literally like a
sharpie it was the craziest thing ever
and I actually I didn't really pay
attention to like the packaging that I
came in because I'm sure it's set it on
there like hey this is super crazy and I
was just like oh look a liquid eyeliner
fine thanks got home took the cap off
and was like oh lord what do I do with
so I can show you on my hand so you can
either do i don't know you guys see this
neither do like the regular so it's a
thin line like that you can do sick so
it's a real thick line like that what i
have been doing and absolutely loving
what this is basically just using this
this regular wing line i haven't really
gotten too crazy with like doing
something big and thick yet because
that's just not what is needed for me
but what i do is just take the sharp tip
i create my wing i do my line all the
way across just like how I did in my
summer makeup tutorial video and then I
take the outside of the wing still with
that really thin tip and just draw the
line connect it got my winged eyeliner
it's so easy with this I love the really
really fine tip on here it makes the
wing so easy it is super black and it
stays it does not smudge it does not
fade I'm so impressed with this it was
like six or seven bucks at Ulta it's the
Maybelline master graphic by ice to do
their liquid eyeliner so far I am super
super happy with this and the last thing
I picked up at Alta is not exciting at
all but it's just the Garnier clean
soothing makeup removing cleansing
towelettes we went on a camping trip a
few weeks back with some girlfriends and
I brought along my cleansing wipes
because it's so handy to travel and you
can still take your makeup off at night
you don't have to worry about lugging
all of your products with you but like
so many girls have forgotten makeup
removers that they were all using mine
which obviously it's totally fine that's
great i would rather people be taking
their makeup off and not sleeping in
their makeup because gross but i
actually ran out the last day of our
trip so i had gone by some more i bought
these Garnier once they say they're for
sensitive skin which is my skin i would
say it says there's no fragrance and um
i don't agree with that there are the
fragrance but i really like him there's
25 in here i think it was like five six
seven dollars somewhere in that range
getting the job done get my makeup off
it's all good the exciting exciting
stuff right here ok so that was
everything from alta and then jumping
into sephora i am so so so excited
to get this product I've had my eye on
up for so long I've watched so many
different review videos I've made sure I
really did want this because it is more
on the expensive side but I got the
shade in light palette from kat von d
the eyeshadow palette there is also a
shade and light face contour palette but
this one is our shadows so it is all
matte eyeshadows here's what it looks
like these are what all the eyeshadows
will look like if you guys can see that
and also has this big mirror on the back
side which is really awesome oh it's
supposed to be divided it into like
little quads so like these four go
together these four go together these
four go together I have used let me
think I have done a look entirely with
this quad and then the other two looks
I've done three separate looks 1 i'm
actually wearing right now today and
then the other ones i've kind of mixed
in matte shades so i am so happy because
to be able to get three looks out of it
is great but there's already so many
more that i'm like i know i can do so
much more with this palette you can do
neutralize you can do natural eyes you
can do smokey eyes you can do lighter
eyes there's some really good light
shades in here too so i'm just really
really excited for this to do a full
video just on this by itself to kind of
show you each of the shades break down
each of the quads and then do a makeup
tutorial look for you what you guys want
that would you be interested in that
because that's really what I want to do
because watching other people's videos
really helped me out because this is
like forty eight fifty dollar range so
it is expensive and that's why I was
really nervous if I it was like you know
is it going to be worth the money am I
going to be able to create different
looks when I first looked at this after
that I was like all of these shades look
really similar to each other like are
you just getting the same shade several
times in a row but each shade even
though like there's a lot of Browns in
here each Brown is so different it's
absolutely incredible and honestly so
the black shade I don't have any black
eye shadows in my collection I have not
10 no blacks at all so it came with a
black it came with this really
great white I love these Bay shades up
here you guys I'm so happy with it if
you guys want to see the in-depth
tutorial where I go over each of the
shades and then do a makeup tutorial for
you please do let me know and I will
make sure to get that filmed as soon as
I can if there's any particular eye
makeup look that you want to see like if
you want natural neutral smokey heavy
like whatever it is that you want to see
please do comment below and let me know
and I will make sure to get this filmed
soon for you so some more stuff is that
I got that I'm just so excited for I
think many youtubers know the name
jaclyn hill and raw familiar with her
she you know is a youtuber herself she's
very loved in the YouTube community I
feel like but she's been doing a few
different collaborations with makeup
companies and she recently did one with
Becca cosmetics like a cosmetics is
known for their fabulous highlighters
and Jaclyn teamed up with them and to
create her own highlighter and I got it
so this is called champagne pop this is
what the packaging looks like sorry if
that's like totally glaring you out
that's what the packaging looks like and
then when you open it up it is like the
standard Becca like people call us a
flying saucer so that's what the
packaging looks like this is what the
shade looks like so this is champagne
pop and this shade is so gorgeous can
you see that on my finger a day that I
got it and went to snapchat so I could
show you guys and like do a swatch for
you and I went to dip my finger in it I
was like oh my god but it's so pretty I
don't know if I want to but I did I did
it I did it it is so gorgeous this is my
first Becca highlighter but they are
talked about so much they are so loved
and once I saw the champagne pop I was
like I feel like that is my highlight
shade because it's not super icy or
white I also own the betty lou manizer
from the bomb which is more unlike that
frosty side which i still really enjoy
it my dog has left the office this one
is more like peachy gold and it is
intense so if you
like a highlighter that's more like
natural this is not going to be for you
because this is an intense highlighter
and it is so gorgeous I just I
absolutely love it again if you guys
want a more like one-on-one in-depth
tutorial on champagne pop like a full
video dedicated to champagne pop and I
can also do maybe like the strobe it
like strobing is really in right now
which is basically like doing your
makeup but not using any bronzer
contouring and you're just only
highlighting if you guys maybe want to
see I could do a makeup tutorial on that
because I've been doing it these last
few days when we've been traveling and I
just didn't want to bring a lot of
makeup or have a full-face makeup on
with what we were dealing with so I was
just basically doing like the strobing
look and using the champagne pop to get
a very dewy effect but if you guys want
to see that too please comment below or
from me on social media and let me know
and I would be so happy to create that
for you guys as well but it's really
gorgeous it's so gorgeous I love this I
feel like Jaclyn hill did such an
amazing job because this highlighter is
on leaked but that's not all because
when I ordered so you guys know that I
do most of my orders online because i
have evades so you can get cash back and
i believe when i put in my sephora i
ordered they were having like six
percent cash back which is really good
but you also get the three free samples
from sephora which i will share with you
but you also get a deluxe sample which
is a sample but in a bigger size well
they just so happened to have becca opal
as a deluxe sample and I was like why
not get champagne pop and opal all the
same time how fabulous is that opal I
feel like is one that everybody loves as
well I feel like it's one of the most
talked about Becca highlighters and so I
was really excited to get it it has
broken so let me see if I can actually
show I'm I don't think i'm actually
going to be able to show you guys okay
so maybe i'll just watch it for you a
little bit but i'm not going to actually
be able to hold this up to camera can
you guys see that this one is opal
that's opal me see oh god I'm like
literally spilling it everywhere I did
do on my snapchat I did
the swatches right next to each other
because a lot of people who are like a
champagne and pop and opal too similar
to each other and I think that answer is
no champagne pop is much more on like
the peachy gold side and opal is more on
like the white frosty side if that makes
sense so and I think I also put swatches
on my Instagram as well so you can kind
of see the differences between the two
today i have on opal i don't know if you
guys can see the highlighted okay but
today i have on opal it's so bummed that
it broke I got it I opened it up I
looked at it I was like this is so
beautiful I took a picture of it for
Instagram and snapchat I closed it i set
it back on my desk later I went back I
picked it up opened it and it was broken
I was like what did I do wrong here I
mean I can still get some product out
but I can't like lift it or like I want
to be able to lift it to show it to the
camera because all the product some
fallout anyways but that's okay
absolutely love these highlighters I
think they are so beautiful and yeah yay
yay like I highlighters whoo and I just
put up my lash dash to go mascara review
video and I mentioned in there i will
link it like up here if you want to go
see that because i had five mascaras to
review and you are able to pick your
favorite on the five and then go and get
a full-size product and I picked the
better than sex mascara from Too Faced
so I just went to my Sephora and got my
free one I just grabbed it walked up
there handed them my voucher and she put
in a bag for visa thank you i was like
well that was pretty simple is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara there's
what the wand looks like and I have an
in-depth review in that video so I'll
link it below as well if you want to
check it out there's five different
mascaras that I give reviews on each of
them and I'm really really excited
because I absolutely loved this better
than sex mascara loved it and then I
just have some of my free samples to
talk about that i got from sephora so i
got what is this i got the nude pro
jenis oh may go treatment rescue oil
that's what the card looks like so it
says it's omega treatment rescue oil it
says day and night gently press two to
three drops onto cleanse face and neck
okay so that's kind of interesting um
yeah i'll give that a try and let you
guys know how i like it another sample i
got they were having i remember when i
checked out at sephora it was like a lot
about skin care and face so this is the
herb orion korean skin therapy black
concentrated mask so that's what that is
so another face mask pack is literally
all not in english it's not in English
at all so um might have to look this up
see I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna put
it on my face but I don't do wash it off
right away do you wait what I don't I'm
gonna have to look that up literally the
back not not an English at all so the
last one that I got is the thing it says
Jack Black authentic and original deep
dive glycolic facial cleanser with
kaolin clay and volcanic ash you guys
what in the world that I get this time
around like last time it was like the
what was like christian dior foundation
no giorgio armani foundation and like
regular things i don't know what i did
this time but it says you use it as a
daily cleanser apply to what hands
lather apply to face rinse okay so that
sounds pretty easy but it have volcanic
ash in it okay i just have a one final
thing to share and it's from the
influenster voxbox so i put all this on
my snapchat so I do a lot of like
unboxing and first impressions and like
today I went to Sephora and swatch a
bunch of kat von d liquid lipsticks i
put those all of my snapchat so if you
guys like seeing that sort of thing i
would suggest filing meet there because
you know it's so quick and so fast and
so easy to put that stuff on snapchat
rather than like wait and have to like
set up and do a video so my snapchat
name is Samantha dot March but I will
also leave that below I also put a lot
of like pictures and swatch pictures
things like that on my Instagram page
which is March books beauty that will be
below as well but I went pretty in-depth
on snapchat about this Maybelline box
box from Influenster and I had on there
like how you sign up but it's basically
influenster com you sign up you take
like little quizzes and surveys and
things like that to get matched up with
certain boxes I mean they have
everything from Beauty to fitness to
food to pop culture too I mean they just
have so much stuff on there but
obviously because i'm a beauty blogger i
got matched up with Maybelline and they
sent the Maybelline better skin
foundation so that's what it looks like
and basically what they asked us to deal
with the box box is to use this for
three weeks and then we just give our
reviews and let Maybelline know what we
think today is the very first day I've
used it so I was sent number 25 nude
beige is what I have on right now so
today's the first day that I used it
tried it on again I put it on my
snapchat like as I was putting the
foundation on and everything so it says
it's the skin transforming foundation it
does have SPF 15 in it what I liked
about it is that it has the pump and the
maybelline fit me which I really love
both the regular fit me and the fit me
matte and poreless they do not have
pumps so you have to pour it out into
your hand so I feel like Maybelline
listen to everyone being like we don't
like to pour this on and they put a pump
on this one so I really liked that it
did pump out really thick is kind of
like a first thing that I noticed I
thought it applied to my face okay but I
really just wanted to mention it to you
guys that I got it and then I will be
trying it and I will be doing a full
video review for influenster here on
YouTube with all of my feedback on it so
I will be trying this out over the next
three weeks so I can give it my fair
review and farrah opinion so far today
first impression I like it I like it so
far so that's good but yeah if you guys
want to check out influenster
try to get these box boxes that they're
becoming so popular right now just head
to influenster calm i will put a link in
the description box below so you guys
can check it out if you're interested in
it but this is my second box box that
I've gotten and I really like it it's a
really easy website easy to navigate
maneuver to understand it's really it's
you know when I say you take surveys
it's not like those really long like 20
minutes surveys it's literally like you
can just do one question at a time like
if you can log in answer one question
and that's it then that's it like I
usually just take some time each morning
and try to answer like ten questions and
that's about all I can do you can leave
reviews on there and that helps you get
badges and earn your box boxes too but
yeah all that information on influencer
will be below and check back in about
three weeks for my full review on the
Maybelline better skin foundation so
that is everything that I've gotten
recently beauty wise from either Sephora
alta or the influenster voxbox please do
