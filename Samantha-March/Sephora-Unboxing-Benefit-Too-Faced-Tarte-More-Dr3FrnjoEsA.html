hear all that noise my dog just ran into
the office like what is this woman doing
but today I'm really excited because I'm
going to be doing my first so fora
unboxing with you guys I placed an order
last week with them and so I actually
got the box last night UPS man came out
like six o'clock or something and I knew
that I wanted to do the unboxing on
camera and I wanted like the first
impressions of everything that I got so
I was like you could open the box with
me and I got two packages in the mail so
I'll just the four box and then I got a
book hashtag shocker in the mail but I
open up the package and I grab the book
out and then I went back to eating my
dinner my husband and I were saying at
the table and he was like well aren't
you going to open that box and I was
like no and let's just stop talking
about it because I really want to open
the box and I want to see everything and
play with everything but I'm doing it on
camera so oh it's been really hard I
didn't even like last night or this
morning I didn't even like slice open
the box which I just did right before
filming this because I was like if I
even like Stern to open it I'm just
going to want to open it more but this
whole day I've just been like what's in
the box I mean I know it's in the box
because I placed orders but let's be
serious get into that too I just wanted
to talk to you guys about ebates and I'm
sure a lot of you guys have probably
heard of a key base or have ebays which
i think is amazing if you do but I like
never signed up for ebates which is so
weird because I'm like the queen of
coupons and of like cashback anything
cashback apps i have those cash back
credit cards have those for four clubs
yep you know I have all of it but for
some reason I was never on e base and I
finally signed up and then I was just
like you are so dumb we place order on
orders on
sign like all the time I do all of my
Sephora orders through their online
store because you get the 33 free
samples you usually get a deluxe size
product to sample and all of those are
free and you don't I don't think you get
that in stores because every time I go
in stores and want to place an order
they don't do any free samples so that's
why I've taken to ordering only online
with Sephora our Sephora is in our malls
and oh even going during the day and
trying to park and then navigate the
people it's like nothing I'm sort of
online so much online shopping I can't
believe I've never had ebates because
what it is is you just go to the ebays
website and then you find whatever store
you want to shop at see if they're
having a cashback deal if they do you
just click the store link it takes you
to their website and you check out like
normal and a lot of times when I online
shop I'll like put things in my cart or
like for Sephora and alltel put things
on my love list and then I'll put them
in my cart and you can even already have
items in your cart go to ebates click
the link to go to Sephora check out
what's already in your cart and boom you
get a certain amount of cash back and
the reason that i did my Sephora order
when I did I've been wanting to put one
in for a while but I didn't have like a
good list buildup in a percent cash back
at ebates and usually it's like four
percent or something like that so I was
like get on it and I'm not for sure when
this video will go up yet having a
16-percent cashback sale because they're
like celebrating an anniversary and
sixteen percent is huge so I'm getting
right up on my alto order in but even if
you get a few dollars back from your
purchases online I'm totally gonna do it
so if you guys don't have a base I will
include a link below I think it's
something like if you use the referral
code you get something like if you use a
referral code and you sign up and you
make a purchase within like so many
months you get a gift card to a store or
something like that I don't it's
something like that but I'll just put
that below but anyways I'm over here
like wanting to open this box and I'm
just rambling away like a fool let's get
to it ok let's dressed so ok so first we
have all that now i have yet my mother's
clip there does ok here we go first so
when you order one sephora you get to
pick out your three free samples and my
first one is the Sephora instant
moisturizer so just a little sample pack
of a moisturizer doesn't really say much
on the back but I am I love moisturizer
I put moisturizer on I wash my face in
the morning and then at night and then I
put moisturizer on after each time I
wash my face and then a lot of times
especially in the winter I'll just put
it on more because I feel like your face
gets so dry but I'm a huge huge huge
moisturizer fan so when I saw they had
this as a first handful I was like I
will take one all of these I mean
obviously I'm opening this box with you
guys so I haven't tried anything and
everything would be something new to me
so I've never tried anything at all
before I just want me to do like a
review video or give you my feedback on
what I think of the products just leave
a comment below and let me know maybe I
can do that video for you guys so the
next sample item I got is the breezy Oh
Ross or go milk the breezy Oh milk it's
for your hair it's a reparative leave in
conditioning spray and it has rosehip
organ and coconut oil oh that's where
the row Sarco comes in apparently
because each of those think we'll
jiggies on the bottle or a highlighted
the are oh you know you see what I'm
saying so that is that I my hair my hair
has been in a bun all day so it's like
really
i highlight my hair a lot I don't use a
lot of hot tools on my hair just when
I'm going to curl it but i I've been
dying it highlighting it for years I
mean probably over 10 years so it's it's
damaged quite a bit so whenever I can
find a good like leaving conditioner or
leave in spray or if I find a shampoo
conditioner that I really love and I see
that it helps my hair i'll stick with it
so when i saw this was on there i
thought why not it says to nourish
repair and renew this lightweight leave
in conditioning spray is fortified with
a blend of relative organic coconut oils
powerful hibiscus leaves and
antioxidants and vitamin E to provide
moisture strength manageability and
softness while protecting against
breakage heat damage a newbie exposure
so this is I mean this is pretty good
size this will get me through a lot so
I'm excited to try this one out okay I'm
sorry if you could hear my dog in the
background she was chewing on a toy and
it just she was driving me crazy and i
bet you guys could probably hear lap so
I just put her outside it's fairly nice
day in Iowa today so hopefully she'll
just hang out with her toy out there oh
my next free samples I got tart guard 30
it's just an a sunscreen lotion SPF 30
so nothing too I mean nothing too crazy
the other free samples I do have one
more which I'm really excited about
share Theo but a lot of the other ones
were like perfume and spray and I just
like mmm I don't really need that but I
was like well you know sunscreen need
that summers may be coming maybe so
that's why I picked that one up I can
let you guys know what I think about it
and then the last free sample that I got
I'm really excited for because it's the
giorgio giorgio armani luminous silk
foundation and this stuff is like so
raved about and it's all over YouTube
and everyone is like loving on it but
super duper expensive and I like
foundation but i'm not a huge foundation
person especially going the summer where
I don't wear as much foundation because
I'm either outside or I'm working out
outside or I'm out a pool or things like
that and I just obviously you don't want
a lot of foundation on your face but
when I saw they had a free sample I was
like yes let's just do it and see how it
goes so I'm really really like really
really really excited to try this out
and see if it is worth all the hype like
I kind of hope it is because because why
not but then I kind of hope it isn't it
because it is kind of expensive and I'm
like who do I want to fall in love with
an expensive foundation I don't know but
I'll let you guys know how that one goes
I thought I had one more thing hmm oh no
that's right so I have the three samples
I had the moisturizer the foundation in
the sunscreen and then this milk because
I how I said it was kind of bigger this
is my free deluxe item because you get
three free samples and then you
typically would get a free deluxe sized
product as well and you need a you don't
need a promo code for the free samples
you just get a pic those at checkout but
you usually need to find a promo code
for these but they're on their website
and if you have a bates there aren't
listed on ebay as well so this is my
free deluxe sample yay so I got for free
items just for shopping online and I got
like five dollars back because I shop
three days winning to what i actually
purchased whoo okay so this is benefit
the bronze of Champions it's their
little like sample pack box that's what
it looks like and it has on the back
like what's all in here if you guys can
see that ok but it's a total bronze kit
for eyes lips and cheeks and I have kind
of what was sold me on this I love
things in
and especially like sampler packs
because you might as well like try
something out for cheaper if you can so
that's why I like these little sample
packs and then with summer coming up I'm
not as tan as i would like to because I
don't do tanning beds and I'm still kind
of afraid of self tanning I haven't
tried that out yet but i find myself
just like bronzer need more bronzer and
i really don't they have like two
bronzers so that's why but really what
turned me on to this one is it comes
with their real mascara and this mascara
i got a sample of it once from alta i
think it was and it is amazing and so
many people that I talk to think it's
amazing as well so it's the they're real
mascara and it is so good and I just ran
out of my sample and was like no so when
I saw this was in here I was like I will
get that but it comes with some other
good stuff too and I hear that they have
some tips and tricks some bronzer tip
our shadow tip wats up tip that's for
highlighter tip so that's kind of cool
they have that out for you but then this
is all that's in the box if you guys can
see that okay one of these days I'm
gonna buy a real camera so yeah now the
products they have like numbers on them
but let's see what this first one is
this is their eye shadow cream i'm
pretty sure right no I saying yeah I
think this is their eye shadow cream in
bikini teeny so and I mean this is it
for a sample size I mean this is a
pretty decent size let's see that's
really creamy gonna give them on my
finger there so sorry that's my middle
finger to I don't mean to like flip you
guys off but then the one next to it
it's actually like their eye shadow duo
so this is the cream part and then this
is the power
eyeshadow and it looks like that ah see
oh so it's just like a bronzy shimmery
color I mean that's pretty so that's
what that looks like if you can see it
ok because it's kind of light but it's I
mean it's it's got that shimmer to it
and and bronze up to it which is like
the point of this whole palette so I get
it I get it I like that i'll definitely
be wearing that and then item number
three is the wats up and it has like
little pictures of light bulbs on it I'm
sorry for you guys notice my hands are
shaking I'm filming this at like one and
I usually eat lunch at eleven-thirty and
I haven't eaten lunch yet I'm real
hungry is the highlighter I believe ooh
and can you guys see that like whoa
that's a hot like that is a highlighter
I like that I love highlighters so yeah
I just kind of like blended it in a
little bit more so you know it's not
like quite as crazy but I really really
like that and it comes in this like
little stick guys you just kind of like
swipe it on there ooh i thought i'm
really going to like that so that's the
Watts up highlighter and then number
four I already kind of touched on but
it's the they're real mascara I'm not
glitter Lee holding my hands like stop
shaking you will get to eat after this
this is what the wand looks like and I'm
just like telling you guys this mascara
is so good I'm not sure how much a full
one cause maybe I can look it up and
like put it somewhere in here but it is
so good I really really recommend this
and I was going to buy the full size of
it but when i saw it came in this little
kid I was like yes let's just get the
whole kit so that's their real but
number two is the hoola bronzer so right
here number two and the hoola bronzer is
so talked about I see a lot of people
talking about it they buy you know the
actual individual of it and they say
it's so good and it also came with like
this little brush like how cute is that
little brush so you can like really get
your bronze going on and so I was like
yes I needed a new bronzer I forget
things about the hoola bronzer this
comes with a brush like yep yep yep love
it so I'm really excited to use that and
that's the bronzer see if I still have
some room on my hands yeah that's really
pretty if you guys the light won't wash
it out too much but it's over here so
that's the bronzer and I yeah i know
that i'll be wearing that for sure so
cool need a bronzer summer need to look
like i'm not the pale iowa girl that I
really am saying is number five does the
hula lip gloss and so again going with
the whole theme of this it looks like
it's going to be maybe like brownish
type shade but let's just ooh that's
pretty it's kind of on the shearer side
so i don't know if you guys will like be
able to see this i put it on but I have
lipstick on but so it's definitely a
gloss it's got a lot of shine to it down
here on my hand very glossy kind of like
I mean it really does look like what's
in the bottle just this brownish new
dish foot with shine so that's fun this
this kit is just so cute the bronze of
Champions so you have to recap you have
a cream eyeshadow and then the powder
eyeshadow which kind of go together you
have your hoola bronzer with its own
little brush you have the highlighter
the mascara and then the lip gloss I
mean
boom this would be so awesome to travel
with great idea I believe this was $32
so that's that one final thing I swear
and then we are done unboxing but I'm so
excited this is like the main reason why
I bought or I put in through my Sephora
order and this is their lash stash to go
so it is five deluxe samples of mascara
and before you guys like start freaking
out and you're like why do you need five
mascaras I will tell you I used to have
what I'm going to try to get this box
open while i do it i used to have super
short eyelashes just like not cute
eyelashes I was always on the hunt for a
mascara or something that would make my
eyelashes look better there's just
nothing I always wore fake eyelashes
because my eyelashes were just so small
it just didn't like it and so I really
didn't wear mascara because when I would
go out or do anything like literally
even at family events I would have fake
lashes on I had like really big dramatic
fake eyelashes I had more natural fake
eyelashes I mean that's all I war and my
friend who she's like a licensed
aesthetician beauty person she so she
has her beauty license and she bought
this serum called babe lash and I
totally meant to bring it downstairs for
you guys and then I forgot so I'm really
sorry but it's just an eyelash serum
called babe lash and you put it on your
top of your eyelashes and it's supposed
to help your eyelashes grow I mean in
two weeks I noticed a difference and now
I'm so happy and I love my eyelashes and
I even had a few people ask me if I'm
wearing fake eyelashes in my videos that
I do and I've never worn fake eyelashes
in any of my videos
as of so far maybe I will someday but
honestly I just really like my eyelashes
now but I really didn't have any mascara
the only mascara i had was define a line
from maybelline i think it was and i
never really used it because mascara
just didn't do anything for me and now i
can use it that's what i have on today
define a line and my eyelashes are just
yay so not just everyone come by it and
it's only available in certain places
because you need to have your license to
purchase it but that is what i use and
so I've been on the hunt for mascaras
because I really want to start getting
more mascaras now that I can finally
wear them again so that's why i bought
the five and they're all deluxe sizes so
they're not like huge mascaras that you
know if we know if i'm going to going to
use but then also with this you get a
mascara voucher and you can pick
whichever mascara turns out to be your
favorite you can get a full-size mascara
of it which i know the Too Faced better
than sex mascara is in here and that's
$23 separately for itself for a
full-size mascara and this whole thing
was only twenty-five dollars so I mean I
just one basically is what I'm telling
you and I'm really excited to try out
these five I have no idea which one will
be my favorite I've never tried any of
them so let's just see what we got going
on how do I open this thing there's more
tape hate tape I'm going to rip this
pretty little box and I feel so bad i
don't want to rip it all open girl get
it together yeah let's get us are flying
everywhere oh my gosh oh Lord oh yeah
okay so these are the five mascaras oh
my gosh you guys are really need to eat
some lunch okay so these are the
mascaras and so we have
of the Too Faced better than sex mascara
and I've heard so many good things about
this let's see oh that's a pig whoo
that's a big ol wand okay whoo all right
but I've heard really good things about
this so I'm excited to try it if I have
any preconceived notions going into this
I think this would probably end up being
my favorite just because of what I've
seen on the review so far but I really
have no idea so I'll let you guys know
and i'll let you know which favorite I
pic for my full size one we also have
the josie maran argan black oil mascara
so this is a cute cute little packaging
kind of matches my fingernails with the
orange but I hear a lot of good things
about the josie maran line I don't have
anything from that line so this is what
the wand looks like um okay so I mean
smaller than the two-faced one and it's
kind of like wavy so um we'll see how
that one works and it's the black oil
mascara so whoa I also have blink
mascara amplified and it says stuff
painting your lashes tube with them okay
so this is bullying I think that's how
you pronounce it may be like a play on
words here with eyelashes but let's just
okay I mean this looks like a pretty
standard mascara wand compared to the
other two which were like kind of
crazier but this one is a there's little
things on here I haven't been reading to
you guys it's a water resistant formula
and wraps lashes in tubes giving
buildable volume I'll be curious to see
if I like this one because I've tried
mascaras that have like the double ends
and one end is like a fiber tube that
you put on and then the other end is the
actual black mascara and I mean they
were ok but if you don't get them all
off when you take off your makeup you
have like literally like you can see
like the black tubes all
your face and it's not very cute so um
we'll see we'll see how this one goes
it's also the tart mascara lights camera
flashes this one is like way fancy it's
got like the gold and it's super shiny
and it feels it's like textured okay see
what we got okay so this one is thicker
than the other one looks to be a little
bit more of a water formula which I like
I tend to like what are mascaras so
again I guess I really I don't know if I
realized that the tart one was in here I
just like saw to face and was like yeah
a lot of good things about this one as
well so hmm it could be a toss-up
between the tart one and the two faced
one or one could come out of left field
and it'll be my favorite we'll just have
to see this one is the Lancome Hypnose
drama in black so kind of like fancy
fancy black and gold packaging oh I was
opening it upside down a live a little
baby just a little baby wand it seems
like so yeah that's a smaller wand it
has a slight curve in it okay even it
like it even like feels lighter than the
other ones just like holding the wand it
just feels lighter but okay I mean hey
who knows we I just got to try them all
out and see what I think of them but
those are the five mascaras that I got
in my little sampler sighs so I'm
excited to give these a try like I said
I get to pick my favorite and then get a
full-size mascara so I'll be sure to let
you guys know which mascara I pick
because I'm like mmm-hmm don't know but
if you tried any of these mascaras
please comment below and let me know
which one you've tried what you thought
of it if you would buy the full-size
sampler because I
really curious to know but again this
was the lash dash to go on sephora and
it was $25 for all of these plus your
voucher for your full-size one so if
you're in a mascara you need a new
mascara you like playing around with
mascaras I mean go ahead and give this
one a shot because it could be something
pretty cool are all of my products for
my Sephora unboxing I hope you enjoyed
