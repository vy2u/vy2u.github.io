channel so I am so excited for today's
video because it is hold please my
Sephora CIB sale Paul boo boo so I
actually did make my purchase online so
I could use my ebates of course but I
just had this so far box left over I
think from like my birthday gift so
through everything in here for the
presentation effect if you know what I'm
saying but I really didn't like go ham
at sephora at least I don't think that I
did but I bought products that I had
been wanting to purchase for a very long
time and I was very methodical in my
planning I you know I had everything on
my love's list I went through it and
everything that I was like yep I've been
waiting for a long time to get this I
put it in my cart and then once I got to
my car I went through everything again
and I was like okay I have two
foundations in here do i need two
foundations at this moment in my life no
let's take one out and i tried to work
through it that way so that way i didn't
end up spending like five hundred
dollars because that's not necessary
like it truly is not necessary so i just
got products that I've been wanting to
try for a very long time and that I've
been holding out to get so I'm so
excited to show you guys what I got I
also did pick up a giveaway item for you
guys as well that you will be seen
coming up very soon I think we're gonna
do the 2k youtube subscriber like very
soon I don't know what's happening and
I'm so excited I'm so grateful I'm so
thankful that more people are watching
my videos and subscribing and thank you
i hope you enjoyed this video I hope you
enjoyed my channel and yeah I to K
subscribers I have a big giveaway coming
for you as of right now I have six items
for you and they are all high-end items
i think i'm going to hit up the CVS like
this weekend or something and try to
pick up a few like new at the drug store
items to put in there as well but yeah
then as soon as i see we hit 2k i will
go ahead and get that video film and get
to give a whip it together and yeah i'm
so excited for it and thank you I mean
without you guys obviously I wouldn't be
doing these giveaways and I just love
being able to give back because
your support truly means everything as
someone who is in the world if you guys
are not familiar my full-time job is to
be an author I have to put myself out
there all the time I have to try to
connect with more people and more
readers because I want people to buy my
books because that is how I pay my bills
is why when people buy my books so I'm
always looking for new ways to get out
there and to connect with people and
starting this channel was just kind of
an idea that I had one weekend sitting
at my house and I truly didn't expect to
find so much joy and so much happiness
and doing what I'm doing and I love
connecting with you guys I love talking
to you online on snapchat it's the best
so thank you check out that giveaway is
coming soon if you're on my snap family
you guys pretty much I think should know
everything that is so far that's been
bought for the giveaway but it's gonna
be very exciting but that some of this
video was about this video is about my
Sephora vib hall so if you would like to
see the items that I picked up during
the sale oldest moser I did obviously
make this purchase online um I was going
to go in store just to see if there's
anything that i missed but i didn't have
the time and i truly I didn't feel like
I had missed anything but then after i
placed my hall order i got an email
saying that i had renewed my vib status
for another year and when you either
achieve VIP status or you renew your
status you get a ten percent off code
the VIP sale was fifteen percent off and
then I was being handed a temper sound
off code that you have to use within 30
days and I was like me and so the other
night i purchased another order but the
reason why i did it was there was a few
liquid lipsticks that were not available
when like during the vib hall they sold
out i think probably during the vib
rouge because roush gets to start before
vib vib get to start before beauty
insider so the shades that i want it in
the liquid lipsticks had sold out and
then they came back in stock but I had
my ten percent up code and with ebates
it was an extra four percent so it was
like basically the same thing so I do
have another order from Sephora coming
there is another giveaway item in there
for you guys as well but i think i'm
going to do a whole anastacio video
those were the liquid lipsticks
that I got I'm going to do a full
tutorial over there over there over
where I'm going to do a full tutorial on
an upcoming video and use some I shadows
of purchase that you're going to see
here and then I'm going to swatch the
liquid lipsticks that I got from her as
well so I did order again but it wasn't
technically for the vib hall so I didn't
feel the pressure to wait for this but
yeah I renewed my stuff for vib for
another year I don't know if that's
supposed to be proud or not I don't know
I don't know about that my husband
probably won't be very proud of me loops
okay so let's just dig in so right on
the top I have a nude beauty blender I
talked well i'm pretty sure everything
that i mentioned everything i'm going to
pull out of here probably mentioned in
my sephora vib recommendations video
except one I know one thing for sure was
not on there but this is definitely on
there I have been so excited to get this
and I'm not going to be able to open it
or am I I actually don't own any beauty
blenders I do own the Real Techniques
makeup sponge but I don't have never
owned anything from Beauty Blender the
brand before and when I saw these nude
ones come out I just thought they were
like the cutest little thing matches my
nails yes yes yes but I am really
excited to use this I just thought they
were so cute and I felt all it will
match your foundation and not look as
dirty I don't know so yeah I just
thought they're really cute so I've got
myself a little cutie blender the next
item I picked up is the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer this
is what the packaging looks like i have
not used any of these items since i got
them since I want it to be able to show
you guys like the packaging and take
them out and etc etc I'll probably do
some reviews later on hopefully you'll
see some in a favorites video we'll have
to see but this is what it looks like
and then I actually did likes watch them
at the store so I know the applicator is
like kind of different this is the
applicator looks like so yeah that's fun
and different I think I got the shade
linen um yeah I got the shade linen i
went to sephora i think
when I picked up my birthday gift and I
did a couple of swatches on this because
I knew I really really wanted this
foundation I've been wanting it for a
long time and I thought linen was my
closest match so hopefully we'll see if
you guys don't know sephora is very good
if you need to return products I have
returned products that I simply didn't
like look I used them didn't like them
they will return them and give you your
money back as long as you have like I
don't I don't know if you need to have
the packaging I always bring the
packaging because I'm weird and I save
the packaging but your receipt and you
get your money back or you know if
something you don't get your right shade
you can go in and exchange it for the
correct shape even if you have used it
so if you don't know that I didn't know
that for a very long time and so now I
know so if you don't know now you know
so speaking of returns went out alum
here bought this so I picked up another
kat von d everlasting liquid lipstick
this is what the packaging looks like i
actually purchased two of these in the
winter i purchased requiem and noble i
believe for the colors i picked up and i
just did not like them I did not like
the formula the colors were fine to me
they were a little different than I
thought they were going to be Requiem
was a little on the ice purple side and
noble was very very light to me so the
colors I thought were just okay but the
formula I did not like I thought they
cracked so quickly on my lips and just
dried 20 like within five minutes I felt
like it was coming off of my lips and
like doing that inner corner thing and I
just was like no and so I returned him I
returned both of them to sephora no
questions asked they gave him my forty
dollars back and I said something on
Instagram I shared my review and so many
people who are like this is my favorite
formula this formula is great I can't
believe that happened to you that's
never happened to me I own all of the
liquid lipsticks and I'm like what's
wrong with me but the shade that I
really wanted to get when i purchased
them forever go was bow and arrow and
bow and arrow has always been sold out
and i saw it was available during the
vib sale and I was like you know what
I'm all about second chances I can give
second chances
now that they have the shade that I
really want it maybe it's different I
don't know maybe it's not who knows I'll
try again i'll see if i find it any
better so i'll do a swatch of this one
but it's so pretty it's like it's that
like brownish brownish nude you know
that everyone loves there's a swatch of
that no I'm gonna try it out I'll be
sure to let you guys know you know if
obviously this one doesn't work out for
me then the kat von d lipsticks are just
not going to work out for me but i
thought i would give it a second chance
but one arrow i know so many people wear
it and love it i see people talking
about it all the time that's why i was
only sold out so that's what convinced
me to give it a second chance because
this particular shade was back so
fingers crossed i really do hope it
works i love the shade it's beautiful
I'm i have is from Tarte it's their
rainforest of the sea Aqua sea lards
their concealer and i'm so excited i got
my shade in light oh i thought i had
medium light hmm i don't know about this
i was pretty sure i want it medium light
because i thought the light okay i don't
i'm gonna have to look in this this
might not be my shade i might have made
a mistake I for some reason I had in my
head that I was medium light but we'll
check it out we'll see if it doesn't
work I can always return it but this is
what the packaging looks like how cute
is that and see if I can open it that's
what it looks like they're so I'm really
excited to try this I really hope this
is my shade now I'm kind of worried but
that's all right um i decided to shake
well what I've heard is that this is
very similar to the mac pro concealer i
believe though it is a very very thin
but i don't mind a thin concealer I
think I feel like one concealer gets too
thick under your eyes like I don't I
feel like under your eyes you kind of
want to stay on the thin side so that's
actually like what kind of attracted me
to this concealer so I plan on using
this in a tutorial coming up very soon
maybe like
their first impressions are trying out
new makeup sort of thing if you guys
want to see that please leave that leave
that in the comments below so I know but
this was just so cute I was interested
in picking up the foundation as well
especially to try the foundation and the
concealer together but I just wanted the
clinic foundation more and I have like
seven foundations in my drawer like I
just truly don't need another foundation
but i wanted a concealer so this is what
I went with hope I love it for skin care
I picked up the bosha charcoal poor
pudding intensive wash off treatment so
what the box looks like I talked about
this in my recommendations video and
I've been seeing a lot of people use it
and I'm getting pretty low on my origins
charcoal masks and I really want to keep
a charcoal mask Iran I think I talked
about that in my skin care video like I
just prefer to have a charcoal mask in
my house so um was since I knew I was
running low on that and a lot of people
have been talking about this one I was
like why not just go ahead and get it I
love the packaging that is very cool see
if I can open it mmm okay so this is
what it looks like inside guys can see
that so it's like black and white and
it's mixed together Casey homes just
talked about this on her YouTube channel
and she says she actually does hers in
the shower which I was like that's a
fantastic idea because sometimes I get
frustrated especially when I use darker
masks and then I'm trying to like take
them off or use a washcloth and your
washcloth is like so dirty charcoal on
it it's kind of a mess but I was like
that's a really good idea to do it in
the shower so I might put this in the
shower as well oh it comes with a I
don't know if I knew this it comes with
a little spatula type thingy it looks
like this so that's two I guess get the
product out that's really nice
especially for when it like gets low you
can have like this handy little tool to
help you but I'm very excited I love
skincare i do have a current skincare
routine video if you guys are interested
I can leave that linked in the
description box below but I do talk
about my love of charcoal masks so I
hopefully I love this one as well and I
will let you guys know their skincare
item
I got it was actually one of the
100-point perks um so if you're a part
of the loyalty program you get points
for every dollar that you spend and then
you can redeem them for products this
was a 100-point perk it is from glam
glow it is their new one it's the
gravity mud firming treatment this is
the one that is silver and that you peel
it off after you put it on like so many
people are wearing this right now and
I've been very very curious about it so
you have to leave it on for 20 to 30
minutes once it completely dries you
gently peel from the edges for itself
excess of warm water use twice a week
okay so and this is supposed to be there
firming treatment which you know I just
turned 29 so we got to think about
firming things up these days if you know
what I'm saying so but I've been excited
a lot of people are talking about it I
really like glam glow I have the blue
mask which is a hydrating mask I believe
another one that seems like a lot of
people really enjoy so this is one that
I was excited to exchange 100 points for
and yeah just a little sample guy really
all you need when it comes to glam
glitzy Mike a lot goes along no seems
like a little goes a long way especially
with my hydrating mask I don't know if
this will be different but we'll see
check it out let's guess note and then I
have one more item in here but it is one
that I am just so so so excited about
and it is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
glow kids oh yes oh yes and I got the
that glow there's also the gleam kit so
I got that glow and I talked to a few
different people and kind of was
watching videos and I asked a few
friends like which one would you
recommend recommend for my skin tone and
they said that glow and it's really
funny because the day I'm helping this
one of my friends snapped me and was
like I love the honest house Eagle kit
and I was like I just got one and she
asked which one I said that glow she
sent me feels like oh you go girl so
this is a what the inside looks like OMG
it's just so beautiful so we have
sunburst golden bronze bubbly and
dripping in gold I am just so excited
for this it seems like everybody and
their mother and their brother and their
beauty guru and there
neighbor has this one and I'm just I'm
so excited to get it I've been dabbling
into more honest hacia products I have
