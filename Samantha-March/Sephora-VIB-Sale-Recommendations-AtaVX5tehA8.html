channel so today's video is going to be
all about the Sephora CID sealed that is
coming up or has already started for
some basically I'm just going to be
going through a few like recommendations
or products that is on my love's list of
that I plan on buying once the sale
starts for me so I got my little card in
the mail the other day for the vib
members it is fifteen percent off
purchases online and in-store and our
dates are april eighth through 13 I
believe the vib rouge which is the step
above the vib I think they started on
the 7th we start vib starts on the 8th
and then I think beauty insider is
either like the day after a couple days
after but I can leave that information
in the description box below to double
check on it if you are not a part of the
beauty insider program with Sephora I
definitely suggest you do it it's free
to join anyone can be a beauty insider
and basically just get points with your
purchases you can redeem your points for
free products but then if you spend a
certain dollar amount you can move up
you can be a VIP and then you can be a
vib rouge and get all these little perks
and bonuses such as percentages off
being able to start sales earlier and
that sort of thing so again I can leave
that information down below but very
excited for the vib sale I've been
working really hard on getting my love's
list together I've been putting together
you know everything that I like must
must have things that like I think I
kind of want to get I've been putting
together some giveaway items because I'm
giveaway going on soon so yeah lots of
things going on I'm not going to go
through my entire loves list because we
could be here for like five days but I
have a couple products highlighted that
I want to share with you guys before we
jump into all of that I do want to say
my Instagram is back
I'm filming this on Wednesday april six
and my instagram was back as of like
four o'clock this morning and so if
you've been kind of like following the
drama i'm not sure what exactly happened
about a lot of accounts were disabled
last week wednesday and we've all been
struggling to get our accounts back like
I've been talking with other people
who've had their accounts disabled no
one really knows why or what happened
Instagram didn't say why but all of a
sudden between last night and this
morning almost every single account has
been restored we all just got the same
email from Instagram saying so I
everything convenience your account is
restored so I don't know what happened
but I'm so glad to be back on March
beauty word thank you to everyone who
supported the new account that I started
so I wasn't without Instagram for an
entire week I appreciate everyone who
came to march beauty inc and supported
me and helped me out i'm still happy to
be back i was gonna do a instagram
giveaway at 5,000 followers than i
changed it to a YouTube giveaway at
2,000 followers and now I'm just going
to do a giveaway as soon as I can get
all the items purchased for you guys I
don't care how many followers
subscribers am at I'm doing it because I
appreciate you all so much and your
positivity and your helpfulness and
helpful comments and positive vibes is
what kept me feeling motivated during
the week where I lost Instagram and lost
so much hard work that I had put into so
thank you so much I'm still currently
buying a few different giveaway items
and waiting for some to get shipped to
me but as soon as I have everything
ready to go a giveaway will be coming
your way also i do have a new camera i
bought the sony a 5100 and i just want
to point out like i have not been yet
able to figure out where to like sit and
out like I feel like I'm so I feel like
you can see from here up and I know you
can see a little bit more but I just
feel very strange and i know the
lighting has not been great yet i've
been trying to work with the up stop and
the iso and all this other crazy stuff
that I've never familiar with I'm trying
to make it work so please bear with me
I'm still getting used to having a real
camera but sorry this intro so long I
just had so many different things to say
but I'm very excited to film this video
and now if you would like to see a few
of my must-have
products that i will be picking up
during the support of VIP sale one item
that i have on here is the anastacio
Beverly Hills glow kit so these are her
highlighter kids and she does have two
different kits that are out there and
I'm honestly I'm not sure which one to
pick if you guys have any suggestions on
what works good for like my sort of skin
tone please let me know because I'm
really not sure when I went into sephora
they only had the one there to swatch so
I was only able to swatch one and I
honestly can't even remember which one
it was now I should have taken pictures
of the swatches and I didn't but it's
forty dollars which at first when I saw
the kids come out I was like forty
dollars for highlighters like that's
expensive but actually I went to alter
the other day and I had it in my mind
that I was going to buy the laura geller
gilded honey a highlighter that like
everyone raves about and it's like 24 or
28 dollars for one highlighter and
you're paying 40 44 that's actually not
a bad deal so you're paying ten dollars
per highlighter essentially and that's
not a bad deal at all and so many people
are using them they look so pretty i
just think i just think that i have to
have it so forty dollars with my fifteen
percent off get a little bit of a
discount in there as well gotta get it
so i have been very curious about the
new collection from Tarte their
rainforest of the sea collection so i
have on my love's list i have their
water foundation and also i want to pick
up the concealer from this collection as
well as a foundation is thirty-nine
dollars that's the one that i have on my
list that i'm looking at but I actually
think I want to pick up the concealer
and I might want to pick up the
concealer a little bit more than the
foundation I'm just hearing really good
things about this collection in general
as I've been watching videos about the
collection and seeing people like try it
on and their first impressions and how
it lasts throughout the day I'm just
hearing really phenomenal things about
both the foundation and concealer I
actually do like I'm not short on
foundations right now and there is
another foundation that I kind of want
to pick up during this sale so that's
why i think i'm going to actually if I
have to choose like if it's getting like
too expensive and i have to like put
something back I might put the
foundation back but definitely I will
pick up the concealer I don't even think
I own a high
concealer besides I have a YSL color
corrector but that's not really it's not
really a concealer so yeah I think I'm
gonna try the tart ring force of the sea
concealer see how I like it but that I
have on here something that I'm actually
not very familiar with it's from buxom
and I don't own anything from Buxton but
I've heard really good things about
their wildly whipped light weight liquid
lipstick they're 21 dollars apiece which
is pretty expensive for a liquid
lipstick so I thought why not get it
during the sale save a couple dollars so
yeah I don't have anything from buxom
but I've heard really good things about
him I've especially heard good things
about their liquid lipsticks so I'm like
why not give it a whirl so yeah i think
i'm going to try something new with
these and see how I like them if anyone
has the bucks and liquid lipsticks and
you like them or you have certain shades
that you would recommend please leave in
the comments below so this next one I'm
pretty excited for its new from kat von
d it's the shade + light eye contour
quad there are twenty-six dollars so if
you guys are familiar with the Kat Von D
shade light palette which is one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes she's
recently put out oh it says the Sephora
exclusive I did not know that so support
exclusive I can insert a picture in here
as well so you guys can see it but
basically it's something that it's an
eyeshadow palette that will have four
shades so that's why it's called a quad
and it's supposed to be specific to or
your eye colors so I have green eyes so
if I click on it it says I would use the
plum and mass can you guys see that the
plum and math is what recommend it for
the green eyes and it says it's an
eyeshadow palette designed to transform
your eyes through the art of contouring
so I don't I find that very very
interesting oh there's also a smoke Matt
and cool grey for all I colors there's
one with green for brown eyes and one
with brownish breads for blue eyes I
think it's very cool I love the shade
light shade light eyeshadow palette like
I love it super duper hard so i think
i'm going to probably pick one of these
up just cuz i think it's so cool so cool
so you guys might laugh at this one but
i wanted to put on my list a Beauty
Blender reason being honestly I don't
own a Beauty Blender I owned the Real
Techniques makeup sponge and I have
tried like knock off brands at the
Beautyblender but I've never tried an
actual beauty blender for myself they
are twenty dollars which i think is a
little bit expensive so why not purchase
one during the sale and see like this
way I can be able to compare the Beauty
Blender and the Real Techniques sponge
which I think would be really useful but
they also they just came out with a nude
beauty blender you know most of the
beauty blenders are pink and I know they
have like a few other colors in there as
well but also it says the nude beauty
blender is Sephora exclusive its twenty
dollars still as you as usual but I just
think the nudes won't her so are like
super cute and I've been watching people
use them in videos and I'm like I want
to nude 12 and then it kind of like
matches your foundation a little bit
better and maybe it wouldn't look a
sturdy because my Real Techniques sponge
is always look filthy so I don't know
you can win to get one has anyone tried
the nude let me know the next item I
have on here is from the Sephora
collection it is their radiant
illuminating drops and I have on here to
get the shade morning light these are
fourteen dollars basically it's like a
liquid highlighter I'm such a huge fan
of luster Lux here on YouTube and I
swear like it whatever it is that she
tells me to buy I'm like okay girl like
I'll buy that like I don't know why I
just trust her opinion so much and I
feel like we might be best friends I
mean she doesn't know who I am and we'll
probably never meet but I'm pretty sure
we are oh but she has talked so much
about these luminizing drops and I
clearly i'm obsessed with highlighting i
love it too can't get them off
highlighters right now but i actually
did try it out when I went into sephora
a few drops on my hand and all right
first I did that by itself and then I
went over to the Anasazi little kid and
I added a highlighter on top of it I
thought it looked really pretty so I'm
down with it I'm willing to try it keep
it rolling the foundation that I
mentioned earlier that I'm curious about
getting is the connect beyond perfecting
foundation + concealer it's $27 a lot of
people have been talking about this
recently I've had my eye on it for that
reason but now a lot of people are
saying and that the Milani two-in-one
foundation concealer is like
a very good deep for it and obviously
it's Milania trucks or so it's so much
cheaper but i don't know i don't use the
brand Milania whole lot of my mom did
just give me some I shadows for my
birthday and I've really enjoyed them
and I know a lot of people enjoy Milani
I have the luminoso blush in another
blush from them but if for some reason
it's just not like a brand that I
gravitate to myself and so I don't know
I'm thinking about possibly picking up
both clinic and Milani getting the
clinic wallets on sale milani is always
cheaper and Milani is usually having to
some sort of deal at the CVS so I'm
thinking about maybe getting both and
like you know testing to see myself up
there dupe thinking about maybe doing
like a high-end dupe video in the future
sometime so I was thinking maybe that
could be a good thing to pick up but
very curious about myself I've seen
people use it and it looks amazing oh
yeah might have to try that one out so a
new collection from Estee Lauder just
came out it's called the Estee edit by
estee louder it's a very it's a pretty
new collection I saw a lot of like the
beauty gurus sharing their snaps of it
it features like kendall Jenner is a
part of it as well so I've been hearing
a lot about it I haven't picked up
anything yet I've been kind of watching
what everyone has been saying and people
who have been testing it out and I'm
hearing really good things about the
lipsticks and hey you can never have too
many lipsticks right so they're
lipsticks are called the barest lip
color they are $22 and it says they are
exclusive to sephora as well it looks
like there is six colors and they're all
pretty nude shades which the barest
color makes me think that they're
probably on the nude side but they look
very pretty so I might have to pick
those up I'm not for sure sold yet
especially because I have other colors
already that I want to get but yeah
could be something kind of interesting
and new so just a few other things that
I have on my list that I'm curious about
getting one is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer it's $12 I feel like so many
people have this concealer and I don't
of it and I don't know why I don't have
it I don't know thinking about getting
it i always say i'm going to pick it up
and then I never do because I really
love the Maybelline concealers now I
want to try the tart concealer but maybe
I'll throw the NARS in there as well I'm
really interested in getting the bosha
charcoal poor pudding intensive wash off
treatment it's thirty-eight dollars and
i've just been hearing really good
things about this i'm such a huge like
skin care person and the mask just like
looks interesting to me it's basically
like white charcoal and black charcoal
you're like mix them together and it
makes like gray on your face and it's
supposed to really help with like pores
and minimizing pores and yeah it looks
interesting good curious about this sol
de Janeiro Janeiro Brazilian bum bum
cream look I'm not gonna lie i'm super
curious about this it's $45 and it says
it's a fast absorbing body cream that
helps tighten and smooth the look of
skin I just think it's hilarious to have
the bum bum cream like can you imagine
like having it sit on your desk or
something and people are like what's
your bum bum cream here like what what I
don't know that's on here as well I'm
gradually sold on it yet but might be
interesting so Becca cosmetics has a
shimmering skin Perfector luminous blush
they are thirty four dollars each I've
been seeing a little bit about these I
really love the back of highlighters
they have 0 6 different shades of blush
but it looks like quite a few are
already sold out which is a total bummer
but they look super pretty I really do
like Becca $34 is a little bit expensive
for me for a blush but I don't know
should I snap it up so I'm throwing this
on here even though I'm probably not
going to get it but I've been hearing a
lot of people talk about it and I feel
like I should like let you guys know I
mean I put it on my list to remind
myself to talk to you guys about but
it's from Tom Ford and when I hear Tom
Ford I hear like dollar signs I hear
like the dollars in my wallet flying
away that's what I hear when I think of
Tom Ford so I've been seeing people talk
about this Soleil contouring compact and
it's a little compact i'll insert the
photo here and it's got the three
different shades in it it says it's a
face palette trio with blush highlighter
and bronzer and i have seen it just
handful of people use it in their video
so I'm like you know could be
interesting it's a hundred and eight
dollars a hundred and eight dollars for
this little compact with these three
shades in it should I say it again it's
a hundred dollars like I love makeup and
I like to collect makeup and I like to
get the new makeup but I don't know if I
could spend a hundred and eight dollars
on this compact but if you can or you
really like Tom Ford or you like these
almost like this like collector items if
these like new hot items I would
definitely suggest buying something like
this during a sale because fifteen
percent of 108 is probably a good chunk
of money I'm not very good at math so
I'm not going to do that that math for
you right now because I don't know that
answer but wanted to throw it out there
because I've been seeing a lot about it
I don't think this is something that I'm
going to purchase for myself but hey
just an idea given ideas to you and then
one last item that I want to throw in
here I feel like I'm such an advocate
for first aid Beauty like I love for say
beauty so much and for say beauty is
sold at sephora if you like first aid
beauty I would definitely take the VIP
sale as an opportunity to stock up on a
few of your favorites or try new things
or if you have not tried for a site
beauty i highly highly recommend you do
I would definitely suggest getting the
facial radiance pads they're my absolute
favorite i love them i just went on a
trip recently with a couple girlfriends
and at night we were removing our makeup
and i was like here try these please put
this on your face please do it please
then they were like what are they so
Mike don't talk just rub it on your face
they are just my absolute favorite I
also really enjoyed the sleeping cream I
use it every single night but first a
beauty such a huge fan of them I'm
definitely gonna be getting more during
the VIP sale now suggest everything for
the Sephora vib sale recommendation oh
I'm so excited my sale starts should be
