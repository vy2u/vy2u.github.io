since we are now welcoming in October
with open arms I got my fall flowers
back here trying to be more fall-like
but because today is the first day of
October I'm going to be sharing book
favorites from the previous month of
September so these are all the five star
books that we reviewed on chiclet plus
whether it be me or someone from a
review team just any book that got five
stars on Chiclets Plus as a month of
September I will be chatting about today
so if you would like to see those books
that got favored it by Chiclets plus
please keep watching is a season of salt
and honey and this is by Hannah tuna
cliff good good you know you know you
know what I'm saying and this review was
my Annie it says from the author of the
sweet and airy novel the color of tea
comes a resonant new book about a woman
starting over following the tragic loss
of her fiance and Annie's review she
mentioned that there was a great cast of
characters she called this a delicious
novel but she mentioned that there was a
lot of Italian recipes throughout the
book which i think is so fun a big fan
of food ebooks so I'm kind of bummed
that I didn't get to read this one but
Andy gave it five stars all of the books
that are mentioned in this video there
amazon links will be below in case you
want to check the book out and then also
linked to the review on Chiclets plus if
you want to read the reviews as well the
next one is the color of water in July
and this is my Nora Carol this book has
over 400 reviews on Amazon so that's
pretty crazy so Annie give this one a
five star review as well looks like it
takes place in northern Michigan says
that she begins to house my dog she
begins to unravel hidden histories of
her mother and her grandmother she makes
a startling discovery about a tragic
death and he mentioned in her review she
said that she read it in one setting
which is amazing but she also said the
portrayals in this book are unimaginable
so that to me is really intriguing
especially I think the cover is really
beautiful just like the simple cover and
then the blurb I thought
as excellent as well sorry my phone is
going off as always but yeah so that was
the color of water in July by North
Carroll and links are below next one is
better than chocolate and this one is by
Jay L Rowan it says three friends a
broken engagement a surprise elopement a
big secret a lot of chocolate christy is
the one who reviewed this one and what I
thought was so interesting I mean her
review is just raving over this book to
the point where I got you know I
sometimes get emails or messages or
people will comment on there and sing
like this review made me buy this book
this review I probably had the most
amount of messages and comments and
feedback saying that people bought the
book because of this review because she
totally did rave over it which i think
is so cool but also she said on a scale
of one to five I give this book at six
so she clearly loved it so that was
better than chocolate one is a five star
from me and this is for wake up call by
Amy and Benzino maybe I'm saying that
right this book I did um I don't know if
I noticed this before I started reading
it but it says it is booked one in the
wake up series which I found very
interesting we follow sarah who
basically wakes up one morning and has
no memory of her past five years so she
wakes up thinking that she's hungover
after a night out with her friends and
it turns out she's waking up next to her
husband and they have children running
around she can't remember getting
married to him she doesn't remember
having their children but because she
lost those memories she went from being
someone who was career oriented didn't
want to settle down was all about you
know her life her ambitions her goals
her friends and now she somehow has
totally flipped the coin and is a
stay-at-home mom married and so because
that she doesn't remember those times
happening she just cannot settle into
that role she doesn't believe it for the
longest time the long without her
memories you know she's trying to get
them back and she's trying to understand
but she's not very she doesn't want to
adapt to them she still is
super confused how she ended up there in
her life she's trying to put the pieces
together to figure out what changed so
drastically in these five years that she
would get to where she was and I just
thought it was really interesting it was
written very believably and unlike she
was going to the doctor she's trying to
figure it out she did give into an
accident and that's what they think had
caused the memory loss and all that
stuff so it wasn't anything like
supernatural or unbelievable in my
opinion and she slowly starts to get the
memories back because you know then I
almost kind of thought like something
big what happened and then just all of a
sudden all her memories are back and she
remembers them but I thought it was
interesting at the book played out as it
unfolds it to see how it went along she
wasn't always the most likable
characters along the way because she was
so adamant that you know something was
wrong like her this couldn't be how she
ended up so I mean she she wasn't always
like someone I was like really like hey
you know she's a good person but she was
so real and relatable and I just thought
it was so interesting and I loved seeing
that this is a series I'm super curious
what the next book will be and I will
definitely be on the lookout for that
next one is her final breath and this is
right by Robert did go me this review is
from Annie I did notice on Amazon it is
the number one bestseller best seller
and thrillers suspense crime / serial
killers so that is the number one
bestseller it has the nice little gold
Technic to it on Amazon it is also in a
series it is in the Tracy Crosswhite
series book too looks like we follow a
homicide detective who was returning to
the police force after a retrial of her
sister's killer and Annie's reviewed the
last line she said something like she
thought she had the whole book figured
out only to realize like she was
completely wrong and I think those are
always nice when it's not super obvious
in the beginning even if we think it's
obvious and then we get to the end and
realize like well that wasn't obvious at
all those are really interesting so if
you're into the mystery and thriller &amp;amp;
suspense and you enjoy reading about
serial killers this might be a good one
for you and the last one that we have
that got five stars in September septum
September
whoa sep tember is cold feet and this is
by Amy Fitzhenry i love the cover i
think that is so cute it's on amazon it
says pre-wedding dinners turn into
serious doubts and this fresh in funny
debut about tying the knot and
untethering from the past emma is the
one that reviewed this on chicklet plus
and she said it is one of the best books
that she has read all here so very high
praise there from ms so again that is
cold feet my egos are all the books that
got five star reviews in the month of
September from Chiclets plus i hope that

very much enjoying making these for you
because it's fun for me to be able to go
a little bit more in depth and in the
reviews that my other reviewers have
given i have found a lot of books that i
have still bought after reading my
reviewers reviews even though I've
always so behind on my reading list and
it just grows and grows and grows and
kind of gives me anxiety but after
reading they're like glowing reviews
it's like how can I not read this book
like a half three did so yeah I think
that is all I have from now welcome to
another month I hope October goes so
well for you I'm trying so hard to get
more into the fall spirit i'm such a
summer girl so basically fall to me
