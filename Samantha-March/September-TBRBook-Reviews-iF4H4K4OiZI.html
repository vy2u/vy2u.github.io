how are you today hopefully quite well
today's video is going to be all about
book reviews and I'm going to be going
through my sep tember reading list of
just talking about all the books that I
reviewed in the month of September I
recently did film the September book
favorites which is all the books that
got five stars on Chiclets plus in the
month of September so if there's any
books that I mentioned in this video I
won't go into their full review and
instead that video will be linked in the
description box below so go ahead and
check it out because I go into more
depth in that video but if you would
like to catch up with my September
reading list and deliberate I have to
talk about is the curvy girls baby club
the sailorman curvy girls baby club this
is by Michelle Gorman Michelle Gorman
has so many books out there and i think
i have read and reviewed most of them
she's a UK writer i really enjoy
Michelle's writing she's definitely very
chiclet which of course I love but she's
also just so nice like she's very nice
she's very personal we talk in email we
talk on social media i enjoy reading her
books so definitely one that i recommend
to check out is Michelle Gorman if you
have not heard of her I will leave the
links to this book below of course the
curvy girls baby club is like a sequel
to the curvy girls club basically in
that one we meet three friends Ellie
jane and katie then in the curvy girls
baby club we pick back up with them and
now all three of them are pregnant but
they are pregnant for like very
different reasons each one is in a very
different situation and then we just
kind of you know read about their
situation how to fix their friendships
their personal lives and all that good
stuff this is a novella so it is a
shorter read Michelle also does put out
quite a few novellas as well she has a
lot of full-length but then a lot of
novellas as well so you know some people
really love reading novellas that's
great I actually don't gravitate toward
novellas that much because I always just
kind of feel like something's missing
are like something more should have been
in there
so I'm actually not a huge novella
reader I'm slowly getting more into them
and say probably within like the past
year or so if slowly been getting into
more novellas and being more okay with
reading them so yes throw that out there
I think I've mentioned that on this
channel before too but yeah so that was
the curvy girls at baby club I gave it a
4 star review on chocolate plus so the
amazon link will be below and also my
review link on chocolate plus next one
is when girlfriends find love and this
is by savannah paige and this is in the
girlfriend series by savannah i believe
i have talked about this series and did
i do a top five chocolate series i think
video and i mention the series because i
love it if you have not read the
girlfriend series i really really
suggest you do i absolutely loved it
there are seven books you can read them
as stand-alones you truly can but it's
so much better if you read the whole
series so book one starts with selfie
and then book seven ends on Sophie
there's 60 girlfriends that we follow so
each girlfriend has like her own book
that you know that's her story that's
being concentrated on and then with book
seven we round it all out back with
Sophie which I thought was a really
interesting idea that typically when you
see that a series follows a set number
of characters you would have that many
books but this one we got a little bonus
in there which I thought was really cool
because it was just a wrap up of all of
the girlfriends really which I thought
was really interesting because we're
back were following Sophie's life it's
when girlfriends find love so obviously
sophie is trying to find love and I will
say that I thought that I may be new
like where she was going to go and while
I was right I will say I was right on
the end it really wasn't that easy to
get there and I really wasn't sure if
she was going to get there to be honest
this a 4 star review on Chiclets plus
but again if you follow that amazon link
the all to other girlfriend books should
pop up for you online amazon page but
then i think even a few should be linked
on my Chiclets plus review page if you
want to check out the series which again
I recommend you do I believe there
a bundle of books 1 through 3 are
bundled together in a collection and you
can get them even if you get a little
bit of a cheaper price so definitely
check that out as well I give this 14
stars just because I felt at the end
when it came to the love interest like
to me it was just too drugged out and it
was like the whole book was like really
snappy and on paste the whole time and
then all sin that got kind of slowed
down a lot and I was like bill what do
we what's what's happening here but on a
whole the girlfriend series definitely
one I recommend that i have is once lost
and this is Viper Carol and I have also
read worlds apart by Burke Harrell as a
well um this one I said in my review
that I was kind of like tickled that the
book is set in Sydney and Dublin because
it's it's like you're just immersed in
that culture like the different words
the different language the different
settings like it was just it was so fun
for me to read that I think Burke Carol
where it's a really fantastic women's
fiction very engaging web inspection but
a little bit of mystery in this book
which I always say that I enjoy so
there's a little bit of like suspense
and intrigue along the way as well so I
gave this one four stars on chocolate
plus so what I have is wake-up call and
this is by Amy and Benzino and this is
one that I gave 5 stars2 so definitely
i'll put it in a card up here but then
also the link to that video will be in
the description box below if you want to
read my full review being the heart and
this is by heidi renee Mason and first
like the first thing that I said in my
review is that I love the cover I
thought it was so cute but also like it
wasn't just a cute cup of coffee the
main character owns like a coffee shop
so it actually did tie in with the bug
because if you guys ever seen books that
like the covers are super cute or very
like I catching but then really has
nothing to do with the story and you're
like how did you get that cover kind of
crazy um this one I gave it a three
point five star review on Chiclets plus
because there were several elements that
I liked but then at the same time it was
almost like the book it was fast paced
and there was mystery in it there was
suspense and intrigue but it was almost
like it was so fast paced but it was too
fast paced like sometimes I was like
whoa wait like okay what's going on now
and then it seemed like certain aspects
or maybe being skipped over like maybe
they really didn't need a mention even
because then I kind of threw me off like
why did we hear all about this and then
that's never mentioned again or really
has not a big bearing on the story but
we got like a whole chapter about that
you know I'm saying like I was just
there were certain parts of it that left
me a little confused and unsettled but
there's a romance in the story I really
did like the intrigue part with the main
characters husband who died in a plane
crash and then she comes to find out he
was having an affair with the neighbor
and then they were actually involved in
like a whole jewelry stealing scheme and
that was all very interesting but then
we bring in an FBI agent and then it
just I don't know I didn't love it but I
didn't hate it it was kind of right in
the middle for me and so I would give it
three stars but I gave at the point five
because I love cover so that was my
September reading list I feel like that
was that really a whole lot of books i
will say i have had some manuscripts
come in for marching inc which is the
publishing company that I own so i have
been reading manuscripts a lot these
past two months they've been kind of
taking over my life we also have new
books coming out with marching inc
shortly i'm not exactly positive when
this video is going to go up but on
October twelfth we're doing not one but
two cover reveals for new books that are
coming out one is Perry in progress it's

this cover I think it's gorgeous i'm so
excited to put the book out there I i
just love cats writing I just love it I

so wild so usually every October I host
some sort of extravaganza to celebrate
the birthday and of course we were doing
it again this year as of time that I'm

free on amazon but it's only till I
think it's friday the 16th or no friday
the 9th or saturday the 10th i'm not
exactly sure when it gets cut off

something back to them so i'll be doing
a giveaway for authors and i'm really
excited for that one yeah we just have a
lot going on and I just want to say that
