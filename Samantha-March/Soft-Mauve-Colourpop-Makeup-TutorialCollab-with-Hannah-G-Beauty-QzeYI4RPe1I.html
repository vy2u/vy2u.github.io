much for watching today because I am so
excited for today's video today is going
to be a makeup tutorial on this look
right here but it is also a collab video
it is my second collab video I'm so
excited but also very nervous because
the first Club video that I did I was
asked to do it by beauty addict next or
and then with this collab video I
actually reached out to the beautiful
Hannah riddle or Hannah G Beauty and I
asked her if she would want to collab
with me and I was super nervous because
I hadn't done that up to this point so I
was nervous but she said yes and we
decided to do a makeup tutorial focusing
mostly on color pop products because we
are both really big fans of color pop
not everything that we use will be color
pop because obviously color pop doesn't
have things like you know foundations
and things like that it's not like a
Maybelline or L'Oreal where we could
literally do a full face makeup tutorial
but we do have a lot of color pop that
will be incorporated I know especially I
do I'm not sure he knows look yet
because I'm filming this kind of super
early because I get really nervous to do
these and they take me so long to edit
so I'm not exactly sure how much color
pop she will use but I use colour pop
shadows color pop highlight color pop
for my lips cloud pop liners so I just I
love color pop so much I'm a huge fan of
them I have so many color pop products
so I was really glad to do a video using
so many of these products I think they
are just a great brand they are so
affordable
I just I love them so I am so so excited
for today's video if you have not
checked out Hannah yet please do check
out her channel she is so beautiful when
I started doing more makeup tutorials on
this channel she was one who I kept
going and watching her videos because I
think her tutorials are so good and she
is just stunning she gives me like Lisa
Marie Presley vibes and I like stalk her
Instagram and I've told her that like
girl I stock your Instagram I hope you
don't mind but she's gorgeous she's
beautiful so happy to be doing this
collab with her and I'm just so excited
so yes
you would like to see my make a tutorial
on this look right here guys first we're
going to go in and prime my eyes I'm
just using my concealer it's the
Maybelline butter skin concealer and I
just like using concealer as an eyelid
primer it works really well for me so
that's what I'm doing is first
sometimes I'll use a brush for this a
lot of times I'll just use my fingers
I'm coming in with creme brulee this is
a shade from makeup geek and I'm just
using a fluffy blending brush from BH
Cosmetics creme brulee I just mentioned
in Kinkos my most recent favorites video
that it's just like my go-to transistor
and increase shade right now it's just
my face
so then I'm gonna pick up mix tape this
is from colour-pop and I'm placing it
all over the eyelid with a flat shader
brush this is also from BH Cosmetics it
came in a stepped and I'm just running
this all along my eyelid when I got my
color pop order in and I saw mix tape it
was the shade that I got most excited
for sorry if you can hear my dogs she
just came into the office I'm also gonna
spray it with the mac fix+ just to kind
of give it a more metallic look you
don't have to do this but I like how it
kind of made the mo a little metallic
oh I'm showing you guys that I hit pan
on it
I was like why am i showing this glove
again yeah I hit pan and I was very
excited so this deeper shade is Central
Perk and coming in with another BH
Cosmetics brush from that same set so
this is like a large pencil brush and
I'm using that and putting it just in
the crease and a little bit on the outer
V just to give the eye some definition
color pop shades are best used to apply
with your finger or with synthetic
brushes which all these brushes that I'm
using are synthetic
I like regular like fluffy brushes that
sort of thing they don't really work
with the color pop consistency um
fingertips really do work well but I
just I just prefer using brushes
and I'm gonna come in with a clean brush
this is the g13 I believe from morphe
brushes it's called their poo London
fluff and I'm just using that to blend
everything together and make sure there
are no harsh lines and then after I did
that I kind of thought the mix tape got
lost a little bit and so I'm putting
that back on mostly focusing on the
inner part of my eye I'm doing my
eyeliner this is the NYC liquid liner
and once again I start doing it on
camera and I think I'm gonna do really
well and I end up popping off to finish
the wing because I just need two hands I
can't hold a mirror you can apply the
eyeliner at the same time and I'm doing
really well and here I actually do like
make the wing and then it's once I start
trying to fill it in but I realized I I
just need my two hands so I had to
finish that off camera
I'm gonna come in with crybaby from
colour-pop this is one of their gel
cream liners it's a really pretty
lavender but it's very bright and I've
been loving this on my waterline it just
really likes makes the eyes pop and I
thought it complimented the shades
well this is the Tarte smoothing primer
I got a pod like the lux sample and my
last up to order and I'm just running
the primer all along my face I'm still
testing it out but so far I really like
it it reminds me of like some makeup
forever smoothing primer for a
foundation i'm using the maybelline but
our skin foundation and my morphe 439
brush just putting this on the face and
buffing it in like you would the
foundation
for concealer I'm also gonna use the
Maybelline better skin once again and
the places under my eyes and I actually
didn't like one of my wings and you'll
see me kind of like using the concealer
to help open it up and kind of like I
made it too big on the one side so I'm
using the concealer to kind of like tone
down my wing and I also place it on
areas to highlight like my forehead my
nose Cupid's bow chin I usually have a
little bit of redness around my mouth
and I'm coming back in and making sure I
get the wing how I want it
and I'm gonna buff it all in with the
more PG to rush this is my absolute
favorite brush for this task I think I
say it in every single makeup tutorial
that I use but I love the more PG too
to set everything I'm going to use the
new wet-and-wild contouring palette and
I'm using the lighter shade in there to
work as my setting powder and placing it
on there with the elf what brushes this
I always forget what brush this is it'll
be linked in the description box below
but it's the brush I use literally every
single day small tapered brush I think
that's what it is
then I'm going to go back in and finish
my eyes and I'm just gonna take the two
shadows that I used and place them on
the lower lash line I'm going to take
Central Perk with a flat definer brush
or no I'm taking mix tape with a flat
definer brush and then Central Perk with
the the same brush that I put it on my
crease lifts and just gonna buff those
into my lower lash line I'm using the
Maybelline master brow gel drama masters
drama gel something it'll be linked on
there but I'm just going to run that
over my eyebrows and for mascara this is
just from Lancome it's their Hypnose
drama mascara but off-camera
I did put on the ardell demi wispies
lashes
and then coming back in with the wet and
wild contour palette and I'm going to
contour my face I'm just using an angled
brush from BH Cosmetics again it came in
a set
I was recently posted to make a picture
on Instagram of this look and everyone
was like freaking out over the contour
and this is exactly what I did this is
how I got the contour the wet and wild
contouring palette is like key it's my
new favorite I just mentioned in a
favorites video super inexpensive and it
does amazing things for the contour and
I just hit the sides of my nose real
fast I don't hate my nose so I don't
usually contour it so I just just hit
the sides real quick for blush I'm using
color pop quarters and placing that on
with the end mmm I'm 4 to 7 for morphe
brushes I believe for my highlight I'm
using puppy love from colour-pop it's
classified as an eyeshadow but when I
got it I was like this is like the
perfect highlight and I'm putting it on
with my fingers I love it I use it as a
highlight I use it as a shadow I use it
as an accord highlight a brow bone
highlight like it's so versatile and I
love it and all the proceeds do go
towards like an animal shelter so I feel
like everyone needs it so I do first put
it down with my finger and then I come
in with the elf flawless concealer brush
and just kind of like make sure it's all
blended in and and all that good stuff
for my lips I'm coming in with
colour-pop Lumiere as my lip liner and
I'll line my lips with it I don't really
do that over lining because I don't hate
my lips either I think they're fine
sighs but I will line them I do really
like Lumiere I just got Lumiere too and
so I thought I'd get the Lumiere lip
liner with it to try out a lip liner and
I love this lip liner you'll see me
going and fill in my lips as well with
the lip liner I started doing this
recently and it helps so much with
liquid lipsticks it's a lifesaver now I
don't feel like I can't fill in my lips
before I put on liquid lipstick in the
first shade I'm going to come in with
from colour-pop is clueless and it's
just a beautiful like everyday pink
color I'm I'm wearing this color so much
right now
and then I'm gonna go ahead and let that
dry and like dance with my coffee cup I
filmed this first thing in the morning
so I still had my coffee with me and my
amazing dance moves of course but now
I'm gonna come in with color pops and
midis looks like a frosty icy pink and
I'm gonna place that just in the center
of my lips to just give my lips a little
bit of like definition I've been doing
this lip color combo for probably since
I got clueless which is very recently
but it's just in my favorite right now I
can't stop wearing these two colors
together and that is the final look hope
you liked it this is the final result I
really hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
tutorial like I've said I absolutely I
love color pop I especially love the
lipsticks like I just I own so many I
