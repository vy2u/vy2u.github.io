making a little impromptu video today
I'm following this on Wednesday and
it'll be going up in the next couple of
hours here but I wanted to make this
video to address a couple of things that
I really wanted to talk about and mostly
focusing on the heart-shaped cake
foundation because I know now that the
shape tape foundation is giving a lot of
buzz for a lot of really negative
reasons I put up my will I buy a video
this morning like I always do it was
filmed yesterday in the morning and I
put it up this morning and I did mention
the tart shaped a foundation in there
and just gave my initial thoughts of
like yes I'm excited I've been waiting
for this foundation thought it was
really cool there's two formulas and all
of that but I went into filming
yesterday's will I buy a video not quite
educated on everything that has been
going on and with this video I do want
to address heart-shaped a foundation but
I also want to just touch very briefly
on another subject I've been getting a
lot of comments on YouTube Instagram
snapchat I've been getting emails from
those of you who watch my videos and
follow me on other platforms asking if
I'm okay that I've seemed a little bit
down or different or just not quite
myself in my videos as of recently and I
definitely agree with it I thought I was
hiding it better but apparently I wasn't
I'm a lot of you could see right through
that which is so crazy to me and I
appreciate all the concerned messages so
much I really can't even explain how
much I do unfortunately this time of
year is always hard for me holiday time
being separated from my family is hard
for me I've always suffered with
seasonal depression which really sucks
but on top of all of that I deal with
depression very frequently in my life
which is hard and you know it can make
things challenging but I've come to
realize that I really enjoy having this
youtube channel because to me it's such
a positive outlet and it's such a
positive part of my day
I love getting ready I love being able
to film I love
able to interact with people and it's
been really kind of like my saving grace
these past few weeks I've had a lot
going on in my personal life that has
been really hard to deal with that has
been very overwhelming to deal with I
might talk about it at length in a later
video but not right now but I did just
kind of want to address that I did want
to say that I really do appreciate all
of these kind comments I talked a little
bit about it on my snapchat last night
and I actually had so many comments
coming in from people you know saying
that they do what the depression is well
and it really helps them to hear other
people talk about it because it makes me
not feel so alone so that was another
reason I wanted to add that part into
this video but it all kind of correlates
together so I'm just oh just getting it
out there that it is something I think
going through and I appreciate it if
it's something that you are going
through you're definitely not alone and
that is for sure
um but how it kind of ties in it to the
tart shaped cake foundation and why I
really felt a pull to make this video
it's because with everything that's been
going on I've kind of scaled back
considerably with social media I've
still been doing a really good job of
keeping up my my daily upload schedule
and I've still been trying my best to
keep hope in my comments section but I
haven't been posting Instagram of as
much I haven't really been looking at
Instagram as much and you're in such a
negative space sometimes if you watch
too many negative things it can have a
really adverse effect on you so I've
kind of scaled way back even just
watching YouTube videos in general I've
just kind of gone into myself to trying
to make sure that I'm okay thinking you
know a bunch of the tags and comments
coming in about the Turk shape tape
foundation and I was really excited when
I saw the news about it because I of
course love the shaped a foundation and
like I said in the wilayat video I've
been one of those that's been waiting
very anxiously for this release but I
definitely missed the shade range issue
before I filmed the will I buy a video
but I filmed it I edited it and I got it
ready to go from the morning and then I
really shut down because of what I've
been dealing with I woke up this morning
I posted the video and I started to read
the first couple comments that are
coming in and everybody was saying why
are you not addressing the shade range
and you know it just things like that
and I'm thinking what's going on and
then going into my YouTube UI elbows and
saw all of these videos that got posted
late Tuesday night or early Wednesday
morning with the Turk shape tape and I
just thought oh oh boy I clearly missed
something very large here so I don't
like using you know dealing with outside
things or dealing with depression I
don't like using that as an excuse I
didn't want to say kind of why I missed
that so all this morning like as the
comments are coming in and I'm thinking
okay I feel like something is going on
here I started watching other people's
videos on my watch to list his video I
watched Jackie Ayanna's video I just
watched my friend live and I've actually
I've been talking with live this morning
because I'm like dude I missed something
here and she was trying to she was so
sweet like she was trying to calm me
down and I was like I feel really bad
about my blog about a video I don't know
what to do it was so nice to me kind of
helped talk me through and kind of get
my thoughts together which I really
appreciate but I went and watched her
video and I was like I wish I would have
been a little bit more educated before I
made my will I buy up videos so I
definitely do want to apologize for that
and like what Liv said to me was that I
think people just want to know that you
I have now seen the shade rage and you
see what the issue is and I was like yes
most definitely
and then Jen loves reviews put out a
video that I just watched as well I'll
link all these videos below but Jen just
did a video and she was like you know
this is really impromptu but I just
wanted to come on and be like I've heard
like basically I don't know what it is I
should do I don't know what the right
move is here and I really appreciated
her video and I left a comment saying
you know I kind of went into my will I
buy a video not having all of the facts
which I don't like doing and I typically
spend a lot more time on
all of my videos than I have been lately
but I just there's been so much going on
that I wasn't able to do that this week
and it's definitely a it's definitely a
good lesson for me I feel like I'm
almost like a little bit selfish and
continuing to trying to make these
videos because I'm like it's helping me
it's it's getting me out of my funk it's
giving me something to look forward to
but at the same time I also don't want
to you know make errors or things like
that so definitely a learning lesson for
me but I definitely just wanted to come
on to say that I did not mean to ignore
the shade range at all and just kind of
explain why that part was not in my
video I mean I don't even think I said
anything about it I really that was one
of my shorter will I buy him videos and
I felt like I was kind of boom boom boom
across the board so I don't even know if
I even mentioned how many shades were in
there I really don't know I filmed that
video in almost a complete blur after
getting a phone call yesterday um I just
let the start of filming that video so I
wanted to just come on and make this
video and kind of address both of those
things I did want to talk about the
depression because of how many people
are my snapchat mentioned that they go
through the same thing and they it helps
them knowing that other people are going
through the same thing so I wanted to
give a voice to that because I think
that it's really important at the same
time I also didn't want to talk about
the shape tape because I just felt awful
when I saw the comments coming in and
that I I didn't even talk about
something that was so big I've spent all
morning watching the videos and looking
up the articles there were definitely
things that I truly had zero zero ideas
about I read the article in PopSugar
today which was very confusing to read I
saw the heart turned off their comments
on some of the Instagram videos I had no
idea that it happened either and again I
don't want it to be an excuse but I'm
telling you honestly what's been
happening in my life and how it
and you know affecting these other parts
of my life as well so I saw that also so
I wanted to come back and just kind of
like redo that section of my will I buy
it if you will but after going through
and watching the videos and seeing the
feedback and looking into everything
that's been going on I definitely have a
very different opinion of the
heart-shaped tape and I have decided
that I will not be buying it I said in
the video that I was planning to buy it
once I got to Ulta for the rewards and
whatnot and I am not planning on buying
it at this moment I think there's still
people that do want to see reviews of it
you know I was reading in the comments
that people have already bought it but I
think after everything that I've read
and seen it's not gonna be something
that I can support and I really thought
hard about this today because I feel
like Tarte has been doing some strange
things lately
I just recently talked about their clay
play - and I didn't understand it I
didn't understand the release I didn't
understand the discontinuation of the
clay play one I didn't understand trying
to like slip a new palette by us I mean
I spent like 10 minutes in my Ulta home
trying video talking about how upset I
was up the clay play - so I don't know I
guess I'm just feeling like some of
these moves lately it's just a little
bit too upsetting and that I should not
ignore it I'm someone who really tries
to stay positive and when I was talking
about this situation on my snapchat last
night I said I always try to bring the
positive vibes but sometimes I have to
admit that I'm awesome as in the best
place so I do that's the that's the way
that I choose to look at life as I try
to find the positives in every single
situation and every single person and
sometimes I just kind of have to reach a
breaking point a lot of things that I
read and the things that were said and
put out by Tarte I can't understand it I
don't understand the logic behind it I
don't know why someone would say that
but I think honestly what is making me
most upset with the situation is that we
really haven't heard anything from the
Tarte representatives my
this little piece and PopSugar which was
very very disheartening to read but they
haven't said anything else in the
situation and same with the clay plate
suit they never really said anything on
the situation other than they listened
to the feedback and wavy fam to the
palate but it was like no it still
didn't make any sense why didn't you
change to the shade name so why didn't
you change the packaging
why did you discontinue the first one
why don't you just release the second
one like what happened here and I know
that they released the 15 shades in each
of the two different lines that they
were doing the end of the day if you
looked at all of the shades across the
two there's clearly people being left
out I've been watching people's videos
and you know trying to understand it get
their thoughts of maybe why this
happened and went art said well we have
10 more foundations coming out later you
know I've been trying to understand why
did they just not get released the first
time why did they not get all released
together why are they releasing
separately Jen made a few points in her
video that she did that I thought about
but at the end of the day I feel like
something that is upsetting me about not
only tart because I've talked about this
in past videos but other brands as well
who are just pushing out too much to
consumers too fast that it seems like
really the the bottom line that they
care about is money I understand that
we're talking about businesses who need
to make money I totally understand that
money has to be in the conversation but
at the same time I just feel like too
many brands are focusing on that and
they're focusing on these rest releases
they're focusing on just boom boom boom
and consumers are getting very angry
with it almost every single week in my
will I buy a video people are like it's
too much
brands are coming out with too much for
not being able to enjoy the make up and
a lot of these these very fast pushy
releases are not great quality are kind
of sloppy etc so I think and I know a
lot of people have very different
opinions on what happened with the shape
tape foundation but that's kind of one
of my point of views I have heard that
deeper
skin transfer foundations that can be
harder to formulate I know that two-face
brought in Jackie aina to help with
their foundation in the past to try to
get those shades right so you know and
genuis saying this to that because those
are harder to formulate like put out the
easier stuff first and sell it but
that's still not right it's still not
okay
just because something is easy for you
or will make you money right away like
is that honestly better in the long run
to leave out a huge group of people a
huge group of people who support your
brain and have supported the brain for a
while and I really don't think that
that's okay I really wanted to not make
this video too long but it's just been a
struggle to get through a but I did want
to come back and just kind of read will
I buy at the turret shape tape now that
I am fully informed and kind of talk
about maybe my opinion of it and what I
thought happened and why I don't think
it's okay because I really don't and
also to just apologize for not having
all the facts first like I said I don't
like using certain outside factors as an
excuse but sometimes I do have to admit
when life has just been a little bit too
much for me and that's basically what
what happened in this situation but I'm
just really sorry for everyone who who
has felt so left out with all of this
heart shaped tape foundation stuff it
does make me really sad I was reading
some of the comments in today's video
and some of the snapchats and it just
really it just it hurts to see that it
hurts to see what other people are going
through as well so I think my biggest
thing with her is that I feel like
they've just been so sloppy with their
releases with you know a brand who is so
I said this in my alcohol and trying it
with a brand that is so communicative
with their their buyers and their
consumers and they put out all these
YouTube videos and they're always on
snapchat etc for them to basically like
shut down when something bad happens and
not address something whether it be the
clay plates who or what whether it not
be the shaped a foundation I don't think
it's right like people want to buy the
shaped a font
everybody a lot of people we're so
excited for the shape tape foundation if
you just put out a better shade range
none of this none of this that had to
happen and I just don't get it I don't
get how this got approved I don't know
how it got put out there I don't know
why the Tarte representatives are saying
some of the things they're say they said
I took quite a few hours this morning I
watched I got up to speed on things in a
real hurry and I do apologize I may be
going through a very tough situation
right now but that still doesn't mean
that I can let my job and my
responsibilities slip by I do feel like
as an influencer especially in regards
to this whole situation and especially
with what I was talking about what's
depression on my snapchat last night it
definitely kind of opened my eyes to how
big my voice can actually be I always
say like oh I'm just a small fish over
here I may realize that well I might not
have as big of reach as a lot of other
influencers I still have a very powerful
voice and I can still use it so I really
wanted to touch on both of those topics
in this video I want it to come back and
explain my reasonings for the tart
shaped ape but I also really want it to
touch on the issue of depression I will
have some links some phone numbers down
below so do you want to say a huge thank
you to everyone who has up the messages
on any of my platforms or have emailed
me saying like girl are you okay I feel
like you're a little off I feel like
you're a little different I appreciate
it so much and then when I did open up
on snapchat last night the out point of
love and messages was really amazing and
honestly gave me the courage to even be
able to come on and talk about this in a
youtube video it's very scary I'm very
nervous about posting this video and I'm
nervous about being vulnerable like this
but it really did give me the courage
and reminded me of truly how big my
voice can be we shave the love and the
positive words so much I hope I was able
to clear up a little bit about the tart
shade tape and what I think about it in
general and what I think about the brand
now that I've been able to get educated
a little bit further I will do my best
to stay on top of it as best as I can to
feed the future but I also
we'll be able to admit when sometimes
things just get a little bit over over
my head for me and I kind of need it to
take a step back so guys so much for
watching thank you for the support I
appreciate it so so much and I will
catch you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
