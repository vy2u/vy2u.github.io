today's video I'm going to be going
through a new box from Influenster that
I received and it is the spice box this
was the biggest box that I have received
so far from Influenster it has so many
different things in it I'm going to go
over each thing that I got I have tried
a few of them so i have a few reviews
that I can give to you yeah if you would
like to see what I got in my latest
voxbox please keep watching I've talked
about influenced are a little bit on my
channel i recently went through the
neutrogena box box that i got from them
but if you are not familiar with
influenster basically it is just a web
site influenced or calm that anyone can
sign up for you don't have to be a
blogger or a vlog on youtube or anything
like that but anyone can sign up for it
and what you do is you take like little
surveys enhance your questions you post
reviews on there for items that you have
and try it out you can create lists of
like products you want to have your
must-haves summer essentials that you
want there's six inches of snow on the
ground and I'm like summer but you can
do that and then influenster will kind
of pair you with different companies
that they think you're good fit for and
then those companies send out products
for you to review you're supposed to
reveal them on the influencer site
you're supposed to talk about them on
social media they give you little like
tasks to complete for each box box that
you receive and it's just a really great
way to be able to receive free products
in exchange for your review and it's
really good especially if you are a
blogger our vlogger and you look for
more content to for your blogs for your
channels etc it's a good way to be able
to get new things to review and new
things to talk about so that's basically
that's like influenced or in a nutshell
my friend Alex from beauty addict next
door I did the holiday makeup club video
with her she recently just put out a
whole video dedicated to influenced her
what it is how to do it that sort of
thing so if you want to check her out I
believe she did it on she has a beauty
Abuk next door channel and then she
asked
has a beauty vlogger 101 channel which
is a really cool channel because she
gives advice and tips to other beauty
bloggers and every single time she puts
out a video i watch it because she gives
tips on like lighting and backdrops what
to talk about how to find things to talk
about like she has just so many good
ideas on there and she recently did one
on influenster which I thought was a
great idea because I think it is really
good for bloggers and vloggers so I can
leave her video that she did I can leave
that link down below if you guys want to
check it out because she goes she has a
whole video dedicated to it how to do it
how to get box boxes etc but so jumping
into it so this is the spice box and
it's really heavy so okay so that's what
it looked like so that showed up at my
door one day and I was like okay let's
see what we got in here so it does come
with this little sheet and then on the
back it had everything listed in here
and it has like what the price of it is
it also has like the social media
information for the company that sent it
to you there's always a hashtag to go
with everything which is really nice
because I immediately whenever I get a
box box the first thing I do is take a
picture of it take a picture of the
products put it on Instagram tiger
influenster tag influenster voxbox take
every company that's on something use
the hashtag all that so one of the
products that we got that we got I say
we because my husband immediately open
these but it is these veggie sticks
because internet so this was like the
first thing that popped out it makes
those right on top so it's from good
health it says enjoy being good these
are their veggie sticks it's fifty
percent less fat than potato chips and
it is the sea salt kind so I'm a big
chip lover I eat Doritos all the time I
love sour cream and onion chips like
chips are kind of my weakness which is
bad so I was interested to try these my
husband like I said I opened the box and
he amelia was like wanna try these and
he didn't like them and I I don't mind
them but it was like I could probably
eat three and then I'm like okay because
the taste just like isn't quite there
you know what I'm saying um so I mean
we've had this egg for a while and we
haven't really gone through it often
sometimes it's like if I just feel like
I need something to crunch on I'll grab
like two out of the bag but not my
favorite but i'm not a huge health food
eater which is terrible i would rather
just had my doritos that was the good
health veggie straws their hashtag was
enjoy being good which I clearly have
troubles with and it says for that bag
it retails add 3 99 other items that I
got that I was pretty darn excited for
is a shampoo and conditioner and like
can you see the size of these like these
are some heavy-duty stuff for me where
is its 16 fluid ounces of each the
shampoo and conditioner it is from silk
box and they got the coconut ones it
says their color safe sulfate free and
paraben free with shea butter so reading
my card it says so box shampoo and
conditioner they are each 599 and what I
thought was really interesting is it
says that soap box is a buy one give one
company for every product sold a bar of
soap or a month of clean water is given
to a person in need our shampoos and
conditioners are always free from cell
fates parabens EDTA and artificial
colorings and each one is full of hope
their hashtag was so people's hope and
one thing they each one has this hope
code on the back and you could go to the
website and enter in the hope code and I
believe that is what gives like the
month of water and like bar of soap I
think you have to make sure you enter
that code in which is what I did right
away so hopefully you're helping people
somewhere I have not used these yet
because I have so much shampoo and
conditioner I keep getting sent a lot of
shampoo and conditioner which I very
much appreciate but I'm trying to go
through a couple bottles before I stick
these in my shower so another item that
was in there is
these foot pedals and let's see these
once a foot pedals give them the boot so
these are 1895 it says give them the
boot offers a cozy one hundred percent
will overlay a top foot pedal signature
insult to keep Tootsie's toasty while
absorbing shock for all day comfort and
their hashtag is the perfect fit I
actually I have not used these yet I
have not found a reason to yet I don't
have any boots that I feel like I need
to wear them in yet but I'm glad to have
these around because you never know when
you are going to need something like
this so might be something I can try out
in the future so also in there were
these two nail polishes from sinful
colors one was a color and then one was
a top coat and i really like nail polish
i do paint my nails often you know not
today because i'm filming a video and
like why would I make my nails look nice
for that but I have been getting more
into nail-polish I've been buying a lot
of the sally hansen gel manicure polish
and then very excited for it so got
these two in the mail and they say
sinful colors sinful shine nail polish
they are h 2 99 it says get over the top
shine introducing sinful colors sinful
shine two-step manicure with gel tech
two easy steps to statement-making Manny
applied two coats of our 27 bold applied
two coats of any of our 27 bold vibrant
colors seal with the top coat for added
shine and where their hashtag is over
the top so I'll be honest since I feel
like I'm all of a sudden nail polish
snob with Sally Hansen I was like mmm
not sure how this is going to be but I'm
you know definitely gonna give it a try
I'm not huge into like this purple color
but I'm like that means I don't have
anything like it in my collection never
know when you might need it so I tried
it out as I was putting this on the
first coat was very light and it was
almost like very runny like if I put a
little bit on my fingernail and then
moved the nail polish would run and I
was like oh
okay this isn't going well put the
second coat on and I was like okay you
know I like the color that looks good
waited for it to dry put the top coat on
I was like okay you know looks fine yeah
it gave it some shine you guys this
totally exceeded my expectations and I'm
telling everyone about this top coat
this is the best top coat for nail
polish that I have used and I am a huge
fan of Sally Hansen's 3d gel topcoat I
think that works so well I called it a
life changer this honestly is even
better this kept my nail polish on
without any chips for nine days for nine
days I had no chips my nails were shiny
nothing was wrong with my nail polish I
was so confused I had no idea what was
going on I actually just ended up taking
off my nail polish because I'm like I've
been seeing this color for almost two
weeks straight like I want a new nail
polish color but I really don't need to
take the nail polish off if I don't want
to totally blown away I'm telling
everyone about it it gives you such good
shine but it seriously kept your polish
in place then I wondered maybe it only
worked because i'm using the sinful
colors nail polish like maybe it's not
going to do as well if i use a sally
hansen polish nope still did so this is
my new must-have top coat when I when
this is gone I'm getting another one
there's no way I can't not have this no
I'm not to tell you there's a lot in
this box I was like what did I do to
deserve this I was so thankful it's just
so cool ok so another thing I got were
some teas and this is from yogi teas so
I have not used this yet but let's see
oh so inside it comes with 2 t's and
there is sweet tangerine for positive
energy and vanilla spice or perfect
energy and says the vanilla spice
energizes the body and focuses the mind
the positive energy supports elevated
mood and energy levels and so yogi tea
says other 499 each for a 16-count of
cheese it says enjoy to intriguingly
delicious samples from Yogi's line of
energy tease the yogi collection
includes 60 varieties of herbal green
and black teeth rich and delicious
favorite flavor and healthful purpose
hashtag yogi tea so I'm excited to give
this a try I feel like I haven't yet
because I'm not a big tea person and I
think I'm like afraid and I don't really
know how to make tea to be like one
hundred percent honest with you I don't
know I don't know how to make tea I've
never done it maybe i'll get i'll i will
give it a shot i'll give everything in
this box a shot eventually but and then
on the back also was save a dollar on
any box of yogi tea so if i try it and
end up really loving it then i got a
coupon so another product that was
pretty excited about is from the not
your mother's a line and it is there
Whip It Up cream styling mousse and this
was a pretty good size I mean it's
definitely like a mini it's 2.1 ounces
but I mean it's a good deluxe sample I
would say and it says for the full size
at seven dollars for this mini size it's
three dollars it says whip it up as a
delicious vanilla cupcake send it moose
rich and moisturizers to tame frizz ease
and help the constraints it may smell
sweet but the salon formulas tiling
moose won't leave your fingers or your
hair sticky their hashtag is nym WI you
not your mother's whip it up okay so i
have on trying this one out what I will
say first impressions was so funny
because it truly does smell like a
vanilla cupcake 100% smells like a
vanilla cupcake I was all about it I
thought that was super cool but also
when you like I don't know will I be
able to do it on camera hold on like a
look how cute that comes out can you
guys see like it almost like comes out
like it's like a in a pastry shop or
something and you're like putting a
topper on a cupcake I thought that was
adorable like the first time I put it on
to my hands I was like oh my God look
look at my moose like seriously it was
it was kind of embarrassing though
normally I used most
a pretty like regular basis and what I
use mousse for is when I skip using
conditioner in the shower and so I have
just shampooed my hair and then I will
take my mousse and i will use it to
scrunch my hair and it kind of gives me
like a curly wavy vibe going on and i
really like it very easy for me say i
don't have a lot of time to shower i
don't have a lot of time to style my
hair skip a conditioner throw some
mousse in it and i've done like my hair
is styled so that is what i first used
this for and i I really don't like it
for that purpose I will say that it does
not leave you sticky it doesn't leave my
hand sticky it doesn't leave my hair
sticky and I really appreciate that
about it but it's almost like it leaves
my hair like too soft and I don't like
that part because it didn't actually
hold any of like my curls or waves in
place and it kind of actually made it
more frizzier which it's not supposed to
make it frizzy so I didn't prefer it for
that but then I thought okay let me try
it like a different way so i shampooed
and conditioned my hair I put my miracle
10 spray in it come through it and then
instead of using like my oils and my
like gel that I put in my hair I just
used this instead and combed it through
I liked that much better it did keep the
frizzies at bay and I felt like it still
my hair was almost still too soft that
it made it really hard to style it
because it was so soft like it would
fall out of the ponytail I have very
very thin hair not kind of like where it
says it builds body I don't see that at
all thicken strands mood I don't know
tames frizz yes when I don't skip my
conditioner and non sticky yes I totally
agree with so it was like some things I
agreed was some things I didn't agree
with I don't reach for it as much like I
was really trying to use it on a steady
basis so I could give it an honest
review but now that I feel like I'm over
that part I'm not reaching for it as
much because it just like I don't know
didn't totally work for me last one on
there is this botanics the power of
plans hydrating day
cream that is what it looks like it says
it's eighty-one percent organic with
nourishing rosehip so this one says it
is 1299 this organic this hydrating
organic date cream softens and
moisturizes skin for 24 hours active
plant extract organic rosehip seed oil
is combined with Jojo jojoba oil and
coconut butter to instantly nourish and
leave your skin looking fresh and
radiant or hashtag was botanics organic
this day cream I am all about if you
guys can see how much I've used I feel
like it's quite a bit I like I've put a
pretty good dent in it because I use it
almost every single day like this is
what I start my morning off with after i
cleanse and like tone my skin this is
what i've been using instead of my
regular moisturizer and it came in a
really good time because i'm actually
almost out of my moisturizer and then i
got this and was like good timing when i
first used it i was like i don't know if
i'm gonna like this because it is a very
very thick cream I'm used to my gagne
moisturizer which is super super thin
very very lightweight doesn't have much
of a scent to it and then this on the
other hand is very heavy and has quite a
scent to it it's not a bad sent but it
does have a scent to it but I have found
that because it's so thick you really
don't need to use that much product so i
can use less product than I would with
my regular moisturizer and i'm still
getting all areas of my face and neck
the set doesn't bother me once I put it
on I can't smell it anymore but I just
it feels so good on the skin it really
does feel like you're hydrating your
skin I can just I can definitely tell
that I'm getting hydration which at this
point of time in the winter and
everything is so dry my hands are like
flicking off my skin is dry my scalp is
dry everything is dry I need as much
hydration as I can this has really been
helping I even found myself using it
like in the mornings but then sometimes
in the afternoon especially if I've been
outside I'll come in and put this on
again because I just really like the way
it makes my face feel I haven't broken
out from it at all I do have very
sensitive skin and it seems to be
working fine for me so very very
impressed
was everything that I received in my
spice box box i hope this video wasn't
too long but there was just a lot of
