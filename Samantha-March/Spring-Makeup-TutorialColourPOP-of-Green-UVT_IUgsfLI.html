everyone and welcome back to my channel
so today's video I'm going to be doing a
swing and make a tutorial on this look
right here if you follow me on snapchat
you'll know that this is kind of an
unplanned video I actually filmed one a
couple days ago but decided to scrap it
I finally bought a real camera i'm very
excited i bought the sony a 5100 i hear
a lot of youtubers and beauty bloggers
and that sort of thing that have this
camera i bought it essentially for
taking pictures because my phone is not
great at taking makeup or product photos
but it is good for filming i have heard
this camera is not great for filming
because it overheats very quickly which
it did overheat in this tutorial we had
to take a little break but i did want to
use it for when i do things like makeup
tutorials especially because i have the
zoom feature and i also not have a
viewfinder so i actually filmed a video
a couple days ago but like i was so
awkward in it you could tell I was
uncomfortable I kept looking at the
viewfinder like I was like what what am
i doing like it was just it was
uncomfortable I was uncomfortable
watching the feedback so I just scrapped
it decided to put together this look
instead I saw coffee break with Danny do
something kind of similar to this she
used like blue as her pop of color and I
have a green from colour-pop and I was
like you know what I bet I could do that
and it's something fun and different
something I haven't tried before so she
inspired me to try out this look so
thank you danny for that but yeah that
is the look that i decided to go for
today i really hope you guys enjoy this
tutorial excuse any funkiness with the
camera I feel like sometimes I might go
out of the frame like I forget that I
have the viewfinder that I can look at
and I kind of went all over the place
but i will be getting used to it i'll be
getting better at it i promise i'm so
excited to finally have a nice camera
I'm approaching my one year on YouTube
which is like super crazy Daisy to think
about but there's kind of cool timing to
be able to hopefully step my game up a
little bit so anyways without further
ado please enjoy my spring makeup
is just
so nice name
you can't force me
we getting his teeth
I could show you
omega chew
good
the world has been frozen
food is just
my time is
I could show you
you
hey
okay and this is the final result I
really hope you guys enjoyed that video
it was a little bit of a process to make
as I'm getting used to transitioning
from working off solely a cell phone and
balancing it on a piece of wood on a
tripod to having a real camera and like
feeling super fancy over here like I
feel fancy I'm in my sweatpants got my
workout shirt on but go walk my dog but
got these lashes on so that's fun yes I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
do give it a thumbs up if you did yeah I
don't think I have anything else left to
say now I have to go figure out how to
edit videos that come off this camera
because that is going to be a different
game a for me as well but I hope you
will subscribe before you go and i'll
cut you guys real soon in my next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
