my Channel today I'm going to be doing
another tag video this is
would you rather booktube edition tag
and I've been seeing a few people doing
in I thought it was kind of interesting
so I thought that's what I would do for
today's video I really haven't like
looked at the questions our thought
about excited to make it like as genuine
and authentic as I could so like I
glanced our room so you kind of knew
what I would be looking at but I didn't
think about my answers I don't have
anything written down so I'm just going
to read the questions and say the first
thing that pops into my mind so if you
want to see my would you rather booktube
tag please keep watching okay so
question one is would you rather read
only trilogies or standalone novels and
that one's actually pretty easy for me
at standalone novels I that's the
majority of what I read is standalone I
do enjoy series and trilogies and all
that fun stuff but I'd say the majority
of the books that I read anyways are
standalone books so that's my answer the
next one is would you rather read only
male or only female authors and I'm
gonna have to go with female because
again that's really the majority of what
i read anyways is female authors that's
the majority of like who I work with on
my marketing side or editing side it's
mostly females I mean my blog is
chocolate plus we're very Chiclets
women's fiction and romance space so
that's that's basically what i read the
next one is would you rather shop at
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble or Amazon and I mean I'm
gonna have to say Amazon because I I
don't know the last time I bought
something from barnes &amp;amp; noble the tape
because amazon just seems like there I
don't know to be sometimes it seems like
Amazon is trying to do over the world
and it's kind of crazy but I I do think
they do good things and I think they
especially do good things for authors
they do have a lot of good programs out
there for authors you know they have
their own publishing press as well and I
know that the authors who have been
accepted into the Amazon program they
really have good things to say about it
which is nice and I think Amazon is very
innovative and forward-thinking and all
that great stuff which i think is
awesome
on the barnes and noble side honestly
they really don't seem to work well with
authors especially indie authors like so
many people I know are like how do I get
my books and a Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles how do I
get a book signing there and they just
don't really from my experience and from
what I've heard from other authors like
they just aren't very accepting of indie
authors and I think that's really sad
and I mean I feel like barnes and noble
like we used to have a couple barnes and
nobles in my area and now we only have
one and i believe they aren't doing well
from what I hear remember the last time
i went there like years ago i would go
and just like browse the bookshelves and
see what was going on and grab a coffee
there and things like that and i don't
go there a whole lot anymore and that's
really long winded answer for this
question but i'm going to go thamizhan x
1.is would you rather all books be
turned into movies or TV shows hmm
that's a good question I don't know if I
okay i'm going to say maybe TV shows
just because TV shows you know sometimes
are shorter and i tend myself i tend to
gravitate more towards TV shows a lot of
times because i can DVR am i can kind of
watch them at my own pleasure type of
thing so they don't kind of take as long
as a movie does because the movie can be
like two and a half three hours that's a
long time i really like those 30 minute
TV shows because i can go and like do a
workout walk on the treadmill or
something and watch a TV show at the
same time and be like yes caught up with
the world i know what's going on so
maybe TV show that was a tough one that
wasn't those good one would you rather
read five pages a day or five books a
week i'm going to say five bucks a week
because that's probably fairly close to
what i read now i typically read
probably three books a week or so is
kind of my average you know sometimes if
i'm busier are from reading really long
books it's only like two but usually i
read quite a bit in a week because we
have such a long reading list reading
review schedule
particular plus and I'm also constantly
like reading manuscripts and things like
that so I'm going to go with five books
a week verse 6 is would you rather be a
professional reviewer or an author well
I'm both oh I don't know how to answer
that question I don't know I mean I am a
book reviewer I own chocolate plus we do
book reviews every single day multiple
reviews a day usually and that's how I
got started and everything back in two
thousand nine is when i start at
Chiclets plus and it was solely a review
blog for four books and for beauty for
fitness for health for anything that i
kind of get my hands on I review and now
I'm kind of taking it over to youtube as
well i don't know if i call myself a
professional reviewer but it is
something that i consider to be my job
so there's that and then i am also an
author I have three books published my
fourth one is going to be published on
july 29 so I'm both if I had to like
pick if I had to stop being one or
something I would choose to be an author
because it's my passion and it's what
I've wanted to be ever since I was a
little girl don't books that my mom has
for us there are several years in there
where the we had to like fill out a
little questionnaire like who's your
best friend and what's your favorite
treat and things like that and one of
the questions as always what do you want
to be when you grow up and there's
several years in there where my answer
is author starting from when I was way
back in grade school so that's my
passion it's my my dream career and I
get to do it so if I had to choose
between reviewing and being an author
it's being an author number seven is
would you only want to read your
favorite 20 books over and over or would
you only want to read new books so you
can't ever reread your favorite ones i
think is what the question is saying and
I'm Saddam's kind of easy for me and
that is reading new books I barely
barely I very rarely re read other books
and honestly it's just because I'm so
busy I I don't have time if I read a
book then I usually review it or if I'm
reading a manuscript or whatever it is
I move on from it so yeah it would
probably be reading new books because
that's just kind of what I do now when I
was younger I would reread books like a
queen like I don't know how many times I
have read the babysitter Club books
because i have read them a whole lot
each book several times so but now it
would be new books eight is would you
rather be a librarian or a bookseller
thank bookseller I don't know if maybe
that means like running my own book
store but honestly would probably be
bookseller I love the concept of like
owning something for myself and I love
being my own boss and honestly I toyed
around a long time when I was getting
into the book industry I thought of the
idea like could I somehow run a
bookstore own a bookstore could I do
something along those lines and I
decided it just wasn't feasible for me
at the time it's still not really
feasible we do have a few small book
stores in the area but you know they're
kind of declining just because of you
know ebooks and names on and and all
that stuff but if I had to choose
between librarian which I have worked at
a library before so I do know kind of
the ins and outs of being the librarian
but if I had to choose between librarian
and like a bookstore owner I would
choose bookstore owner 49 is would you
only want to read your favorite genre or
any other genre except your favorite
genre and I would probably want to read
my favorite genre my favor John Radha's
you know Chiclets and I just really
enjoy reading that genre I like being
inspired I like feeling happy I like to
laugh and that's just that's my favorite
genre I love reading it I do like so
many other genres out there but I would
never want to have to give up chicklet
and number 10 would you rather only read
print books or ebooks and I'm gonna have
to go with ebooks honestly it took me a
little bit to get on the ebook train I
owned Chiclets plus oublie a year maybe
even two without owning an e-reader
because I was like an e-reader no one
wants to read ebooks on a tablet oh you
guys
crazy i'm not going to go by tablet
they're gonna fizzle out soon clearly i
didn't know what i was talking about so
i got my first kindle probably around my
second year of starting chiclet plus and
it was because it was literally a
necessity and now especially being an
author it costs money obviously to print
your books and then ship your books to a
reviewer and sometimes you don't get a
review and then you kind of have wasted
your twenty dollars in a precious book
for really nothing in return and you
know ebooks cost really nothing to send
out if you're comfortable sending out
your files or if you can you know send
your ebook a lot of times you can gift
it through amazon or things like that
and it cost the price of your ebook so
you're only spending two dollars versus
closer to twenty dollars when sending a
print book so ebooks just all around for
me I have to have ebook capacity to do
my job for Chiclets plus and really just
to be an author in general because i
read you know as I'm formatting my books
to go out into the world I'm tracking
them on my Kindle to make sure
everything looks okay formatting wise
and everything is fine with the kindle
so as much as I love print book so much
and I always get so excited when i get a
print book or paperback or hard copy or
whatever it is i get so happy because i
love filling out my bookshelf but I'm
gonna have to go with you books on this
one II so that was the would you rather
booktube edition tag just ten for
questions hopefully this video won't be
too long I try to keep my answers and
short is like good but I tend to ramble
a lot but I hope you enjoyed this tag
video I will be tagging a few of you so

I will be choosing a few people to
complete this tag as well if you guys
know of any other tag videos that you
think look fun and that you would like
me to participate in please just bring
those to my attention and I will be sure
to write them down there are so many fun
ones floating around out there I think
that it's just so cool and it's just a
different way to see other people's
answers and a little bit more into like
their personalities and things like that
so I think they're really fun too
