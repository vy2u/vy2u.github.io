today's video is going to be all about
some new tart
releases so I recently picked up the new
tart stick foundation and then also
their clay play eyeshadow contour face
palette their big old news palette they
just came out with I featured these
items in a blue eyes video which I can
leave it link down below and I got so
many people requesting that I get these
products and review them so that is what
we're going to do today that's why I'm
makeup free right now I am going to be
showing you guys the eyeshadow palette
doing a look with it and then also
applying the foundation so you can see
how it looks I have been using these for
a few days my videos come in a little
bit later because I wanted to be able to
give my review and feedback instead of
doing a first impression because I feel
like some of my videos lately have been
more first impressions I have some
thoughts on at both of the two items
that I purchased I also have like a very
mini tart haul I can show you a couple
other things I picked up and then I also
picked up an extra clay play palette for
a giveaway which will be at the end of
the video so if you are interested in
winning your own clay play palette from
Tarte cosmetics then wait till the end
and I'll explain how to get entered in
that giveaway so obviously I've
purchased the action palette and the
stick foundation and another thing that
I really wanted to try out was their
glow with the faux they're a sunless
tanner it's their foaming self-tanner it
is a mousse I picked up the deluxe size
sample of it so it's a little bit
smaller I think this was $12 compared to
like 39 or something and it doesn't come
with a mitt but I thought that was okay
because I actually have extra tanning
mist I picked this up I haven't earned
it yet I will plan to do a Instagram
video when I do it anybody else has
tried this let me know and then I think
realize that tart has such good like a
good reward program I always talk about
how I purchased a lot from Sephora and
Ulta because they like their reward but
tart does - you do need to sign up for
word and it's free just like Sephora and
Ulta and I think you get like one point
per dollar or something like that and
then you can turn those points in for
like money off your orders but you can
also get samples so this looks like the
free sample that anybody can get I just
you know pops up on the page right away
and I decided to take out this brush
because you know I love makeup brushes
and Michael
now another one to my collection so this
is just like a flat shader brush I think
it said it was best with like cream
eyeshadows but I'm probably going to use
it in two shades tutorials so excited
about that but then once I plugged in my
information like the last time I ordered
from Tarte which is probably a year ago
I signed up for the loyalty program and
they said since I was a member I could
take out another spoonful and I was like
well that's really cool so I picked up
the Tarte rainforest of the sea marine
boosting mist because I also love making
this and you know maybe some more makeup
mist so I got those and I was pretty
excited about it I just thought I'd show
you a bit what I got but yeah these were
three other things that I got my haul
so why don't we go ahead and jump into
the eyeshadow palette now so they're
clay play palettes this is the box that
it comes in super super fun so it says
it's a face a shaping palette so it's
supposed to have shadows in here that
you can use as eyeshadows that you can
use this contour is bronzer for your
eyebrows just just an entire like full
face type of palette it looks just like
the box and the first thing I noticed
when I took it out was like this is
heavy duty like this is a heavy pala
this is no joke and then when you open
it up you have all of your shapes here
and you have a really nice big mirror
how it was $46 I talked about my wilayat
video I was like it was $46 kind of a
lot but when I thought about all the
different shadows you're getting and
then I really love that bronzers and
contours are included in here like I
probably won't use any of these shades
for my eyebrows because that's just like
not the way that I roll and I'm not that
adventurous yet with my poor health but
I was like four eyeshadows and bronzers
and contour shades like that's actually
pretty frickin cool especially cousin
last week's cool I buy a video I talked
about a nine shade eyeshadow palette
from makeup geek Belles $50
this whole thing was 46 like okay so
when I opened it up I immediately got
super excited I liked how it was kind of
built into these different little trios
like I said I've been trying this a lot
the first time I tried it I was just
kind of playing around the next two
times I tried it I did it by the trails
sometimes when you're just not feeling
super creative it's like hey it's
already laid out for you so far you guys
super super impressed I mean I have been
wearing this probably the last like four
days straight I'll go through and do
some swatches and here are
first three swatches the first little
trio so we have journey stone and then
solstice those are what they look like
and I feel like I can tell Apella is
going to be good one like a simple basic
white shade swatches like that because
normally they just don't really show up
so the first time that I did it I used
it as just an all-over base color before
I pinned any shadow stone and it was
like well that actually really showed up
with this middle shade which is called
stone is an amazing beautiful warm brown
and then journey is the other one that
I've been loving to use in my crease
like those first three shades were some
of the first ones that I use in this
palette and I was like yeah yeah we're
looking good and then in the next trio
of eyeshadows we get a little bit darker
so we have dunes smoked and then sand so
there is dunes smoked and sand and then
there those are swatched out on my hand
again you can see they're very pigmented
they show up very well and there is a
little bit of fallout with the palette
that I noticed I could kind of like see
it on the actual palette when I was
doing my brushes in that there was some
fallout but there wasn't actually any on
my face which I appreciate it because
when I got done i dint feel like I need
to take a weak voice to my whole face
with this throw again just beautiful
swatches they show up really well I've
been really liking the shade when I want
to really deepen up in Isla and then in
the last row we have like even the
darker shades amber and onyx and
Instinct okay so we have ember onyx and
instinct so onyx is the black and it's
not like the blackest black I've ever
seen in a palette like if you want to
pail it with like that true true black I
really don't think onyx is in really
liking instinct to put all over my eye
as well because it's like a perfect but
kind of like creamy beige type of shade
again this one has been really nice for
a deeper crease color so out of the
traditional eyeshadows that are in there
every single one has impressed me the
only one that I was like kind of it
about was onyx because I thought it
would be like a true true black and it
just didn't like pack as much as well
punch as I thought it would but I love
all of the eyeshadows and then in the
last room here we have some
and contour shades so I've been mostly
using this one which is terracotta as my
bronzer and then this one in the middle
which is desert it's a little bit on the
cooler side so that's what I've been
using as a contour shade and I just love
routine for this palette because of all
of the different shades that are in here
so here are the last three and there is
what they look like so again this is
what I've been using as my bronzer my
contour and this one is a little bit too
deep of a bronzer for me so I haven't
really been touching that one lately and
very impressed with these I think they
work really well they apply nicely to
the face they feel my son's face they
look good I've been very very happy with
these with the two that I'm using as my
bronzer and contour shade so impressed
with them so those are the swatches from
the Tarte clay clay palette and let me
go ahead and get into a little demo on
my eyes so first I'm going to pick up a
little bit of a journey I'm using my
brush that came in the tarts make
believe in yourself' collection and I'm
just going to apply this in my crease
next I'm going to grab a morphe brush
this came in their copper rose that I
think it is and I'm going to pick up the
shade ember which is in the last little
trio here apply that to the crease as
well just a little bit lower than the
first shade kind of focusing it a lot on
my outer V first before I start to blend
it in words I'm taking of another brush
from that same collection and then I'm
going to go into onyx and I'm just going
to tap this on the outer V of my eye
first and then slowly blend it in the
outer V you don't want to use this brush
to blend it in because then it's going
to take the block in too far so first
I'm just going to make sure I get it on
the outer V where I want it then I'm
going to grab the brush that we used
with ember and then I'm going to start
blending it and I'm going to pick up the
brush that I just got from my left side
and I pick up instinct which is to last
shade in this last trio over here I'm
going to apply this on the inner part of
the lid I'm not going to take it all the
way over to where the black is I just
want to focus this on the inner part
the lid and you can see all these
shadows are so pigmented they're so
smooth and I mean you can see my eye
area the thirst there's been no fallout
so and then I'm going to grab the first
brush that we used from the Tarte
collection and I'm just going to blend
everything together I did pop on some
liner and then my pure bombshell lashes
I'll finish the rest of my eye makeup
after I do like foundation and concealer
setting powder and so on and so forth
I'm just going to take the two darker
shadows that I've used and put them on
my lower lash line in case you are super
curious of how I'll finish off this
eyelid but hopefully you could tell from
that demo how easily they went on how
well they blend it together I've just
been so super impressed with the
eyeshadows in this palette I think they
are fantastic if you are like a matte
neutral lover I think that you would
totally totally get on this palette if
you're someone like me who like things
kind of all together like this I think
that you will also really really love
this palette because I've just been
having the best time using this and I've
been very very impressed with it so I'm
going to pop over to my face and apply
the foundation and talk about that but
to wrap up with the eyeshadow palette do
I think it's worth it yes I do if these
are your type of shades if you love the
matte neutrals I think you were totally
going to get on with this palette I've
been super impressed with the shadows
I'm very very happy with this super
super glad that I bought this palette
because I think it will definitely come
very much in handy when I'm doing some
traveling this summer and need something
kind of all-in-one I've just been super
super stoked with it we'll come back to
it a little bit to show the contour in
the bronzer but yeah this is a good one
I definitely definitely recommend it if
I'm moving on in the face I'm first
going to just spray this little guy that
I got the marine boosting mist just
should just to give my face a little
spray Oh smells nice so the Tarte clay
stick foundation I'm looking at the tert
website right now it says it's a 12-hour
creamy matte clay stick that will feed
your appetite for weightless natural
coverage and good for you nutrients they
have plenty of different shades I got
mine in light/medium neutral and it's
like two or three shades too light for
me which I'm super bummed about
especially with summer coming
I just I'm going to have to do a lot of
bronzing I want to wear it so I'm just
going to apply it directly to my face
now the first thing that I noticed about
this is that it is definitely definitely
very creamy sometimes with my stick
foundations I noticed that like
especially as my I'm sad day one I feel
like I always have to either put oil on
my unsiyyah
foundation art spoil my face first like
it just doesn't move around very good I
feel like what's this foundation you
have to put a lot on like I feel like
I've gotten heavy on the foundation and
with my other stick foundations like my
hourglass vanish stick foundation I
don't feel like I have to put this much
foundation on in order for me to get
coverage but with this one you
definitely do so right off the bat I
didn't really love that like I noticed
the first time that I put it on I was
like um they're just not like a lot of
coverage to this and I kept having to
build a delta makeup having to build it
up and as I was watching more people you
know do their videos on it and like
snapchat and things like that like I
noticed how much foundation people are
using and I was like oh okay like you
really have to use a lot of it um but I
like to apply it with the Beauty Blender
I know a lot of people are saying they
prefer brushes but I feel like when I
use a brush it's just literally brushing
the foundation away like I don't know I
just I don't feel like the coverage is
as good when I use a brush and I've just
found that I like the Beauty Blender a
lot more and I feel like you can tell
that it's just too light of a shade
feels anyone so you can see what it
looks like on my skin this is what it
looks like on my skin you can feel like
I have a blemish here and it's not
completely covering up and one here so
I'm going to have to go back and put
more foundation on those spots but I
don't know I mean the coverage to me and
I even have some redness here and it's
not covering that up either the coverage
to me is just like okay I don't know
it's like light to medium like medium at
best I would say I'm going to go back in
and then just cover a few of those areas
of redness coverage I just I wish there
was a little bit more there
for me um it does feel nice on the skin
though it's pretty lightweight which I
like glasses the foundation looks like
on my skin one thing that I will say is
that I do feel like it is very
long-lasting I think it says it has like
12 of our where and I would agree with
that like I said I've been wearing it
very often this path like week or so
past like four or five days and it
really does last very well I've even
played volleyball with this on my face
and it lasted through volleyball still
looked good which I like so I think it
does have a really good a long wear to
it but I also I just don't feel like it
does anything for my face like I don't
feel like I just I don't feel like I had
like a really flawless looking face when
I finish I don't feel like it just gives
my face a boost it kind of reminds me of
like the wet and wild foundation that
I've said that I didn't like because it
didn't do anything for my face except
the wet and wild
I felt made my face look like flat and
dull this one I don't think it does it
just doesn't it's just not doing
anything for me so I was kind of
disappointed in that like I left a long
wear of it but that's really like what I
like the most about it I'm really
actually not that impressed and this
isn't my shade and so I thought about
buying a different shade because I was
like honestly in the summer I could
probably use this as like a concealer
shade like that's how light it's going
to be on me so like well I could just
keep it and get in another shade and I
don't think I want to like I don't I'm
not going to return it I'll keep playing
with it and trying it like I said I
could probably be a concealer so
whatever but I don't think I even want
to pick up another shade that's more in
my shade match for me to try so the
foundation actually was kind of a
letdown for me which is a bummer but you
know the first day I tried it that was
kind of my thoughts like I wish it made
my face look nicer butter healthier
fresher flawless something I don't know
anything and it just really didn't it's
just it's foundation on my face and it
doesn't even cover up redness or
blemishes all that well like that was a
bummer to me so the foundation I don't
think I can really recommend it which
completely bums me out because I was
super
super excited when I saw chart was
coming out the stick foundation I knew I
was like yes I'm totally getting that
I'm Way excited for it been getting more
into stick foundations like let's do it
I've tried the Tarte rainforest of the
sea foundation it's one of my favorites
so I was like alright I'm ready for this
and I just kind of fell flat for me so
well where my eyes are finished and
we're just going to finish off of the
face so like I said I've been using this
middle shade desert as a contour shade
again I'm going to grab another brush
from the Tarte make believe in your self
collection what I do is I just kind of
swipe it back and forth and then I just
kind of move my brush up when your
contour you don't want to contour down
because it defeats the purpose of a
contour to just have very good things to
say about this palette if you were still
wondering if you should get it I really
hope this review and demo helps you out
so you can see everything in action and
see how they work but like I said I have
just been so happy with it I highly
recommend I'm also sorry if you can hear
Aerys snoring because she's sitting
right next to me just in serious
dreamland I'm going to grab my morphe r2
and then I'm going to dip that into the
terra cotta shade and then just use that
to bronze up my face the shade as a
bronzer like I said this is going to be
one of my new like go-to bronzers for
the summer because I just think it is so
so beautiful so lastly I'm just going to
pop on a lip color this is escape from
the tarped color splash collection I'm
not sure if my blog has gone up yet I'm
not sure when it's going to go up but I
