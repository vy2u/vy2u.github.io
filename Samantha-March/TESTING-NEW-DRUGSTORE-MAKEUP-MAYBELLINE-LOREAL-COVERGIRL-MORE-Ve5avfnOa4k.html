today's video is going to be all about
to rug sort makeup I'm going to be
testing out some drugstore makeup
specifically new drugstore items and
then you guys know what I thinks I'm
starting off with a bare face because
I'm going to applying everything and
then letting you know my feedback I'm
super excited about this I have
Maybelline and L'Oreal and elf and civic
era Sonia Kashuk I have a lot in here
and I think I can do a full face of it
so I'm super excited I did pick up most
of my items from Target and I got some
from Ulta too and a couple items were
sent to me but I'll go through
everything as I am putting it on but I'm
really excited to test out some of these
items because a lot of them have been
getting hype in both good ways and bad
ways so I'm excited just to try them out
for myself Before we jump into it I do
want to say thank you guys so much for

those are both going on right now so
they will be linked in the description
box if you are interested in winning
some make up yourself but why don't we
go ahead and jump into the side of
goodies the first up I'm going to work
on my eye I'm really excited because I'm
going to be using I want to be new
Maybelline and city mini palettes so
this is what it looks like this was
actually sent to me from influencer to
review which I was very excited works
I've been very curious about these they
haven't been getting the best reviews
though so I'm except to try it out for
myself and see what I think I got sent
to the rooftop bronze palette which I'm
so excited for because that's like my
go-to look is what good bronzy loves are
very small palette so there is a
close-up of what the rooftop bronze
looks like these are $9.99 you have a
different variety of palettes like I
said this is the rooftop rods that they
have other ones too so I've seen this at
the drugstores and they're also
available
also so as always everything will be
linked down below
so besides noticing that it is is quite
tiny all of the shades in here
I do have my eyes primed was my ELF
primer that I loved so much that I
mentioned Emma make up monthly videos
I'm going to zoom you in and we're going
to see what we can create so first I'm
going to grab the shape right here
because some of these other ones look
very glittery and shimmery and while
this one still has a shimmer it's not
quite as like glitter intense I'm going
to grab this brush from SL mythical am
it's the l34 blend beauty and I'm going
to go ahead and work this into the
crease I mean you don't always need a
matte shade in your crease I'm going to
makeup you can do whatever you want and
sometimes I do like a really pretty
shimmery look but I mean that's showed
up really nicely I only did you know
this rolled my brush around like I
normally would and I feel like that's
showing up really nice it is definitely
very shimmery and a very bronze shimmer
but so far for the pigmentation I think
that looks pretty good so next I'm going
to come in with this deeper shade on the
end I'm going to use the same brush I'm
going to pick up just just a little bit
here and then cap it on the outer V of
my eye center how dark would be it so I
kind of just lightly tap the brush and I
just wanted to bring some extra
dimension right here on the outer corner
and I think that looks really nice again
it's a shimmer shade but it's not
glittery or overwhelming there's not a
lot of fallout on my face I don't really
see anything on my face shimmer glimmer
wires anything like that
so are so good for the city mini and I
want to try this glitter shade right
here it looks to be pretty glittery I'm
going to use the T 18 from SL miss glam
I'm first going to try it with no liquid
or anything
it's a pigmented but it's also like very
glittery and the glitter is definitely
going all over my face heart isn't great
and as I'm blending it is definitely
kind of like sheer so I am just going to
spray my brush real quick not only to
help maybe bring out some pigment but to
kind of hopefully help it not fall all
over my face so I sprayed my brush so
let's go ahead and see ooh okay so that
makes it so pretty it's kind of like
when you place it down zone kind of
around it is kind of sharing out the
shadows so I'm going in on this side
with an already wet brush and I can
already tell the fallout is way way less
on this side so I would definitely say
this shade would apply better with some
sort of setting spray I am definitely
gonna have to clean up on my face enough
you guys are going to be able to see it
on camera but I'm going to take them a
good place and kind of wipe everything
off but I'm going to leave the eyes
alone for a little bit if you guys watch
my other tutorials I went to place on my
face shadows just in case like with this
palette I hope we had a lot of fallout I
don't like to do my face makeup first
but I also don't like to finish off the
eyes until closer till the end so I'm
going to switch over to the face but I
wanted to show you guys swatches from
the palette so these are what all the
swatches look like tell the one that I
use on my on my eyes all over the lid
that definitely is very glittery but
they spot really really pretty but I
think they swatch better than they
actually perform on the eyes and I just
take a makeup wipe and I tried to wipe
off all the glitter off my face but it's
definitely still there so I might just
be shining like a disco ball ultimate
below - that's okay but yeah here are
the swatches from the maybelline city
mini palette we'll be going back into
this in a bit but I'm going to work on
my face now so first I'm going to prime
I don't have a new primer but I still
wanted to use drugstore since this is
all about drugstore I'm going to use the
Milani prime shield and this is their
mattifying and pore minimizing primer
and I have a couple of new items here so
I'm going to be using the elf blending
sponge I found this at Target I want to
say it was like five or six dollars at
Target and I thought it was super cute
and I've never tried an elf blending
sponge I asked on my snapchat and I got
a pretty mixed response when people said
yes they love it some people said no
good so we're going to try it ourselves
and then from foundation I'm really
excited to try this one this is new from
covergirl it's the vitalist healthy
elixir I got mine in the shade 740
natural beige I have no idea this can be
a good color match or not again this is
a very hit-or-miss I'm either hearing
really good things or
I'm going to get things so I'm excited
to try these out so I got the elf sponge
wet it does feel really hard so we're
going to see how this goes the covergirl
foundation it is $11.99 at Ulta I just
pumped a little bit out on to my ELF
sponge I will say I like that it comes
with a pump I think that's fantastic the
glass packaging is really really nice
like definitely drugstore is stepping it
up definitely drugstore prices are also
going up to go along with that so we
will see how well this is going to color
wrench me I really have no idea and I've
been outside in the Sun so much and I
think no matter how much SPF I'm putting
on and continually very applying I am
still getting quite a tan
okay so the elf sponge I feel like I'm
hitting myself with a boxing glove this
is it it is really really really hard
and well so the foundation has a nice
scent to it it's not too overwhelming
it's not too overpowering oh my gosh I
really don't like the sponge I set up so
color wise I want to say I feel like
it's a pretty good match but at the same
time I don't know if I really notice
anything I'm going to put a little bit
more on and see I kind of feel like I'm
I feel like I'm putting a lot on but I'm
not really like like you can still see I
have redness over here I have redness on
my chin it's not really covering any of
that so I go ahead and try to add a
little bit more on here so it does it's
a lightweight full coverage makeup feel
like adding the second round did work a
lot better I can tell that my face looks
better now it looks a little bit more on
the smallest side the redness is covered
up pretty well except for I have one
spot on my chin that doesn't it just
broke out last night probably cuz I was
in a car for eight hours and had two
coffees and two folks let's not talk
about it
so the long died so I woke up with a
nice and breakout but other than that I
feel like it covered really well
it does feel light on the skin I like to
cover to the gift I almost have like a
bit of a glow to it too which I like the
sponges and I do not like just wonder at
all do you like that so far I just have
to remember that I need to use a little
bit more
maybe I regularly was or even could be
you know maybe the sponge absorbed a lot
of it too so it could be that but once I
put on that second layer I feel like I
really liked it a lot more laugher
concealer I'm going to use the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow concealer this is a
new item from L'Oreal so L'Oreal has the
pro glow foundation that I love and a
lot of people love and they just came
out with the concealer the pro glow like
blue of YouTube the Pro Bowler
foundation the pro glow concealer I hear
I'm hear nothing about
I'm hearing nothing so I'm super curious
about this and I also picked this up
from Target this is from Ecotools it's
they're like blenders so it's called the
perfecting blender duo and it comes with
like a bigger one and then a smaller one
I'm going to try these out I'm going to
use these smaller guy for my concealer
since I use the elf one but I do hear
really good things about this sponge so
I think I'd probably use it as an idler
I feel like I've like my spacers from
using that sponge it was so hard so I'm
going to go get back wet and then we're
going to see what we think of this
concealer so some of the claims on the
concealer it says it lasts up to 16
hours it says it's supposed to be a
glowing coverage was to be a lightweight
radiant formula so this is what the
applicator looks like it was very flat
on both sides so that's interesting I
don't feel like I've really seen that
although this looks dark for a concealer
what shade did I get Oh too creamy
natural you can use this little eco tool
to sponge
I like how kind of the flat on the both
sides so I like the sponge a lot a lot
more than the elf run right away I like
these angles too and that's pretty
interesting so I have the concealer
broke down I mean the color isn't isn't
too bad like I'm someone who really
likes white under eye a little bit
darker but it blends out really well
there like I can definitely see the
radiant under eyes like the glow that
they were saying the concealer has it
definitely does have a bit
glow to it I can see it and I recently
have realized that I like the kind of
glowy concealers I like the number-7
radiant glow concealer I believe it's
what is called so that does look pretty
the coverage though is kind of sheer I
would say it doesn't really cover up as
much as I would normally tell for my
other concealers like this red mark is
peeking through and I have a pretty like
fierce vein under my eye under here that
sometimes concealers can kind of help
like not even cover all the way which is
kind of make a list noticeable I feel
like I can still notice it right away so
not sure the coverage is the bus and
then I have this breakout here that it
really didn't I feel like it just made
it more prominent actually so that's
interesting I don't know what I'm going
to do I like just to say it just right
now I what can film another video after
this I'm going to go ahead and film a
video and then film the outro so I can
have this makeup on for a couple hours
so I can give a better idea how it lasts
throughout the day so that's what I'm
going to do because I don't know how to
fairly judge the foundation or concealer
with a first impression so as I'm going
to do I did just use some that
translucent setting powder on my ever
eyes like I would normally do to set the
concealer so I'm going to move on to
bronzer I picked this up from target
from a Sonia Kashuk Casey Holmes was
raving about this recently it's there
pretty cheeky face palette so it has
some assignment packaging here and that
has a trio inside the bronzer the blush
and the highlights the blushes looks
very very orange this look $20 so I kind
of went back and forth on like did I get
it do I not get it I decided to get it
she was raving about it I don't know if
I've ever tried anything from Sonia
Kashuk it can be found at Target if it
is kind of one of those grants it's like
more expensive but I thought I could
give it a try this is what to be
packaging it looks like and then when
you open it up you have your three shape
and you do have a mirror which I think
that's pretty nice I'm just kind of
waiting so at least for $20 I mean
that's really nice to get a mirror along
with it you don't see that a lot for
drugstore may use my pixie and merriam
NYC double ended brush I'm going to use
the safer bronzer and the set when we
get to highlight but Piketty can be
found
target too so so far I think so good
showing up its pigmented it's pretty
it's like soft and pretty though it's
not like super super overwhelming
I think that bronzers really pretty I
noticed to kind of build it up a little
bit but I don't tell if that's really a
bad thing with bronzer because you don't
want it to be like too overwhelming to
pigmented like you can't blend it out
and it doesn't look good and you have
harsh lines and all that fun stuff but I
thought this one's blending really
easily it looks pretty looks nice on my
skin I believe there was only one
palette dealt with only one shade range
some a little bit on the forehead as
well you know I do I like that shade
that does look really nice I try this
blush next it looks to be pretty orange
so I'm a little bit worried but we're
going to try use my morphe force on my
favorite blush brushes and that is
already really pigmented I hope you can
see it I know some people are saying
that my legs are too bright I did have a
ring light on but when I turn it off I
feel like it's so dark no even though
I'm filming in front of a window with
natural light when I have to zoom in it
takes some of the light away I'm not
really good with camera setting so if
anyone has an idea of settings I could
change when I have to like to zoom in
for makeup tutorials let me know but I
try to still have my light on but just
back it up so maybe it wouldn't be so
bright but if I turn it off my face is
like a shadow
so mmm never to opening one of the new
suggestions I am all all ears I just got
my ring light so I'm still trying to
figure it out but you have this blush is
really really pigmented it's not like
hot more enduring anything on my cheeks
but it definitely gives them an orange
slush okay so the blush looks nice I
like if it's not like a hot Orange on my
cheeks or anything like that looks
pretty but yeah you need a very very
soft hand with that blush I'm gonna pop
off camera and fill in my eyebrows I
don't have anything new from the
drugstore eyebrow wise but I'm going to
fill in my brows and then we're in a
jump back and finish off size browser
done I pledge us a little bit of
liner in my waterline is from remote
cult in the nude so I'm going to come
back into the city mini palace and I'm
going to grab the shade right here with
a elf
2:02 brush and take that deep bronze e
shade and apply this on the lower lash
line so I was worried it was going to be
super super dark because it's watched
pretty dark but actually it's not too
bad
still preen it's getting the job done
it's just it's not I was really worried
it was going to be really really dark
from elf a swatch looking like butt and
it is a little sheer as well I have some
shimmer to it also I'm going to take out
my morphe e18 and let's take this top
shade right here just a nice white light
shimmer I'm going to place this on the
brow bone and then also my inner corner
so we have very very shimmery eyes I
know some people open telling me like
you can't put shimmer on your brow bone
it has to be matte and I'm like why
didn't we tell people how they need to
do their makeup or how they want or make
it to look like that to me is very
strange I love the shimmer on the brow
bone I'm obsessed with it I'm doing any
winged liner I've been giving winged
liner alas and I just I don't have a new
liquid liner from the drugstore to use
I'm not using any falsies because we are
going to use the L'Oreal voluminous lash
paradise of mascara and oh my hands
listen getting a ton of hype this was
$9.99 at Ulta and everybody has been
raving about this one there's a lot of
better than sex mascara
dupa videos going around I have the
better than sex I do quite enjoy it so I
know to see if this pretty little pink
mascara into a pink mascara if it is
similar to the two-faced one I feel like
right off the bat the wands are going to
be very similar
you know what that wand looks like so I
use that mascara quite a bit I'm just
doing the bottom lashes and I'm already
like really impressed like usually
bottom lashes don't really get me going
but that looks really nice I have a very
short lashes I mean you guys see me wear
falsies 90% of the time so there we are
with mascara on looks really nice again
my lashes aren't ever like super
overwhelming but that looks pretty good
I like it don't really like curl very
well so I can tell they're kind of like
falling down already but in terms of
length and volume I think it does look
nice we're done with the eyes I'm going
to go ahead and highlight so I'm going
to jump back into the Sonia Kashuk
palette I'm going to use the highlight
shade I'm going to use the other end of
my pixie brush you'll see what kind of
light we good whew
okay that's really pretty champagne gold
I would say it does look pretty it
doesn't really show too much texture
either so that's nice it doesn't feel
like super soft like the kissing hands
in the Smashbox one it just like feel so
like softened I just I mean that
highlight palette is amazing but that
looks really nice mm-hmm do like that
nicer Kate goes with her look well with
the gold and bronze I like that the
finish also look I have a lip color here
from Pacifica this was sent to me as
well as featured it in my latest PR haul
that I can leave link down below it is
their devasena natural lipstick not 100%
saying that correct so it's a creamy lip
colors in the shade tenderness
these are $10 specific so you can find
at Target and acqua alta on the Ulta
website it is $10 here is what that
shade looks like and on the Ulta website
it does it's 100% vegan and it's a
hydrating natural lipstick for creamy
hydration highly pigmented lipstick okay
so the first thing I notice is
definitely super creamy which is great I
like that color a nice nude pink of a
bit of a sheer kind of with a glossy
tint to it I still think it's pretty
pigmented and that's really pretty I
like that pink so I would normally spray
my face after doing a makeup look and I
just want everything to give a fair
chance we get normally would since we're
going to
back in a few hours and see how things
are holding up I'm just going to use my
pillow mist spray my face real quick but
after that that's going to do it for
right now what I'm going to do is
actually film another video my mom is in
town from Alabama
I was Iowa we might even hang out for a
few hours things like that but I want to
give at least a couple of hours before I
come back and do the outro and kind of
give like my final opinion on everything
so far I do really like the way that the
look came out like I do think it's
really pretty sometimes it's kind of
wrecking what you haven't used anything
and you don't even know if everything is
going to kind of mesh well together but
I do like the look I think this is
really pretty but I'm going to wait a
few hours and then I will come back to
do the outro let you guys know how
everything held up and give my final
thoughts hey guys so I'm back it is
almost 8:30 and I got done filming at
1:32 I feel like I was able to give this
a pretty good wear test so this is what
I look like after what 7 hours 7 hours
up where I have been just hanging out
with my mom all day we did some errands
I've been outside playing with my dog
and I did eat dinner so this is what we
look like after all of that I'm just
going to run through each of the
products that I use to give kind of my
thought on them and then my final
thought of how they held up throughout
the day so first starting with the
Maybelline at the city mini pellet in
the rooftop bran and I feel like the
shadows held up really well both on the
lid the lower lash line is holding up
really well nothing this is going to be
like my favorite I don't think I'm going
to be reaching for this a ton but I do
think it lasted pretty well throughout
the day there still a lot of sparkle and
shimmer on my eyes some fall out lets
throughout the day I could tell us
having to like brush aways or glitter
underneath my eyes so there is some fall
with the palette and I mean I don't
think it's going to be my favorite go-to
palette but I actually am kind of glad
to have it in my collection because I do
go for bronzy looks quite a bit so if I
ever want a pretty shimmer I could reach
for this one it is only $10 which is a
bad price for your six different shades
I do think it's watched a lot better
than it performs on the eyes so still it
was a nice palette you know very compact
and small if you want to travel with it
no mirror or anything like that but it
was decent it's not going to be my
favorite eyeshadow palette but I think
it's held up well throughout the day too
so this one's pretty good pretty good
so for my face I used the covergirl
vitalist healthy elixir foundation I
actually think this held up really well
especially in psychie I don't see it
like separating in any spots sometimes
foundation can separate look around my
nose but I think it held up really well
and I like it I like the finish that I
gave it's not super dewy but it's not
super matte and yeah like I said I've
been out in the 90 degree heat and I
think it looks pretty good so far so the
only concern I had with it was that when
I first went in with it I didn't feel
like it had very good coverage
definitely not the full coverage like a
claims but that also could have been
because of the beauty sponge that I was
using so I'm going to try it with a few
different sponges and even some brushes
but so far first impressions for this
one and seeing how it held up throughout
the day I am pretty happy with this guy
so it's awesome for the elf Beauty
Blender that I used I did not care for
this guy I will not be using this again
it was super hard no matter how what I
got it is hard when I was hitting my
face with it it really kind of like felt
like I was touching myself and I can't
tell if maybe it's soaked up more
foundation than one of my like favorite
Beauty sponges would and maybe that's
why I ran into that issue with the
foundation I'm not sure so yeah
unfortunately the elf sponge I didn't
really like this concealer we use the
L'Oreal infallible Pro glow I'm going to
have to use this a couple more times to
get a good impression on it I'm kind of
looking at my under eyes all day but
what I thought initially was the
coverage was pretty sheer to me I don't
feel like it really covered anything I
have some red marks under my eyes I have
some veins that other concealers can
help conceal or at least camouflage like
this one when I ended it out it kind of
just like disappeared so I didn't notice
much with this but I'm going to give it
another try you know I'll give a few
more tries to get a final
impression on it I'm gonna have to keep
an eye on this guy because as of right
now I'm not so sure it used this
Ecotools sponge with the two flaps eyes
I really like this guy and excited to
use the bank Ecotools sponge as well
because I heard a lot of good things
about this one but I really did like
this and I think this would be really
good for baking on the under eyes too so
I'm excited first impression on this guy
that was pretty good so for the Sami
past shake apart I am pretty happy with
this guy's not the bronzer was really
pretty I did have to build it up a
little bit the blush was definitely
super pigmented still see the blush on
my face and you can definitely see the
highlight I thought the highlight was
definitely the standout from this
palette a really beautiful kind of
champagne type of highlight I mean yeah
and still I'm so glad you can see the
blush that's that's really pretty I like
that it comes with a mirror it is twenty
dollars at Target but this is a nice
little compact I mean even to travel
with but nice to even just do your
makeup in so so far I like that one so
thank you to Kasey Kahne's for the
recommendation this one I do like and
then for mascara I used the L'Oreal lash
paradise voluminous last paradise I do
like this mascara I'm not a huge mascara
person because I normally do wear the
false lashes but especially in the
summer you know something to outside all
day like wearing sunglasses and that
type of thing I'm not going to bother
with false lashes I do wear mascara more
in the summer as well and so far so good
it did seem very comparable to the
better than sex mascara so I'll probably
test those out on my own and so when I
do maybe like my makeup monthly I can
mention some of these things in here too
till you guys know my final final final
thoughts on them but so far that seems
really nice for the director that seems
like a really really good option so I'm
happy with this guy cube well lastly was
my lip color this was it the lipstick
from Pacifica the natural creamy
lipstick so I have eaten I mean I feel
like you can see like a pink tinge to my
lips but I definitely don't have a
lipstick on will say that for dinner I
did have corn on the cob so I mean I
feel like really is no lipstick was
going to hold up the best corn on the
cob but especially you know not a liquid
lipstick or a long wear matte lipstick
you know this is more of the regular
lipsticks
figured whatever I ate it probably
wasn't going to hold up the bust but
against corn-on-the-cob I mean I was
like kind of setting it up for fail but
but it did look really pretty throughout
the day I mean I just ate dinner about
an hour ago or so and it was still
looking good throughout the day we like
to the pink color if you like regular
lipstick versus like a matte lipstick I
think these could be a good option for
you like this lipstick I didn't have any
problems with it but yeah it's not going
to be a super long wear or like last
year through dinner types of lipstick
but still really nice for a regular
lipstick option so I did want to zoom
you in a bit so you could maybe see how
the makeup looks up close as well my eye
shadows mascara you can see my lipstick
is pretty much completely worn off but I
like I feel like the foundation did hold
up really well just a little bit of
redness on my chin is peaking through
and like I said it's very hot I'm kind
of sweating right now so I'm a little
bit shiny but nothing like too bad
highlight blush bronzer everything is
still looking really good so I mean I
should I feel like it's still really
sparkly just a little bit of fall around
my face but nothing too bad so there we
go
okay so that's going to be everything
for my testing new a drugstore makeup I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and we need some comments down

the makeup that I tried have you tried
any of this what have you been loving
not loving what did you think of how
they went on and how do you feel at the
end results when I say seven hours later
how do you think everything held up so
far I'm really excited there were a few
misses in there but I don't feel like it
was too bad I'm pretty excited about the
foundation that was trying to find a new
good drugstore foundation and obviously
everything I need to try again you can't
just use things once and you know have
like a solid opinion about them but I'll
definitely be trying things out
differently but I feel like we found

good decent products also but I'd love
