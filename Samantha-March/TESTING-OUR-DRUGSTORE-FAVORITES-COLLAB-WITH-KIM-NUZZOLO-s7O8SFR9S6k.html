today's video I'm so excited for a
couple different reasons a first of all
it is going to be a collab video which
always has me excited I'm climbing today
with my friends at Kim Missoula here on
YouTube I probably should have sent her
a message and said hey girl can you
confirm how to pronounce your last name
for me but I'm collabing with Kim in
today's video and I am really excited to
do this collab with her if you are not
yet familiar with Kim's video of course
it's gonna be listed down below her
video that we are doing will be listed
down below as well if you are a fan of a
drugstore makeup I think that you will
absolutely adore her channel she does a
lot of videos with a drugstore makeup
she also has a really good series called
budget Beauty buys where she actually
goes to a discount store such as like PJ
Maxx and Marshalls she takes you along
in there and shows you all of the
discounted makeup that you can get at
places like that and those are some of
my favorite videos are from her to watch
but I highly recommend at Kim's channel
when she reached out to me she actually
asked if I would want to do a drugstore
style video with her which totally makes
sense and we are actually going to be
trying out some of each other's a
favorite drugstore makeup products so I
went to my CVS and I also had to stop at
Ulta for a few things but we gave each
other a list of some of our favorite
drugstore products and then I went on
the hunt trying to find some of hers and
she did the same but for me so I'm
excited to see the products that she
grabbed out but that is why I'm starting
with a bare face because I have some
goodies in here so now I will be testing
out today and seeing if I can find any
new drugstore favorite based on cams or
recommendations the other reason I'm
excited for this video is because it's
actually going to be a sponsored video
with readable so when cam reach out and
asked if I wanted to do this video a
part of it was her also asking if I
wanted to team up with Greedo for this
video and I was like ok I haven't heard
of this brand yet so let me look into it
let me see what it's about and I
immediately it was like oh this is such
a good pick for me if you guys haven't
heard of gradable yet Kim and I did send
each other a little box and I haven't
opened it yet and I'm so excited to see
what's in here but I of course will have
a greedy bullet list down below a big
THANK YOU to them for working with both
Kim and I on this video but basically
it's like a personalized service that
you can send to someone so I'll open up
the box and explain more as I go into
this but I thought that this would be a
great fit from
because this is right up my alley with
what I like to give people I recently
just made a photo book for my best
friend for her 30th birthday when we
went down to Arizona I do a personalized
calendar every single year I put my own
personal photos in that calendar each
month when I flip over the calendar
there's a personalized a photo and there
for me for April it's Aries and in her
cute little face looking at me every day
so I do a lot of photo gifts for people
so when I saw this I was like this is
such a fun service because not only does
it incorporate photos and the gradable
that you are sending but you can also
include little gifts in there the themes
in there too such as like bridesmaids or
like Mother's Day is coming up so when I
was on the gradable page the other day
they have a lot of like Mother's Day
type of themed greedy bullosa for you to
send so I thought it was really cool I'm
gonna show you guys the gradable of that
Kim sent me first and then I will go
through and try out some what drugstore
makeup so it's a big old video today and
I'm really excited for this one make
sure to check out Kim's channel but why
don't I go ahead and get started because
I really want to open this box up so
this is what the box looks like when you
get it has green apple on the side here
and then it says oh what do we have here
green ball also did give me a discount
code if you wanted to try out the
service for 20% off it's just Samantha
March it's not an affiliate code for me
it is just a discount code so I'll have
that listed down below this is so cute
it says that someone wants you to smile
I do have to have my ring light on today
because it isn't dark and it is raining
it's supposed to snow
cuz it's April and it's snows in Iowa
which is great okay so this is what the
box looks like I'm so excited like I
said I haven't opened it so this is what
it looks like oh it's super cute okay it
says peel open both sides okay I can do
that okay so I am oh my gosh I'm slowly
opening it up oh my gosh this is so cute
okay so there's a little gift in here
but look at this ah okay so this is what
the greeted ball looks like and she put
one of my makeup photos on here and then
she also posted a photo of Aries that is
so cute it says dear Samantha hello my
beautiful friend I wanted to gift you
with something I knew you enjoyed so I
picked the nail polish I hope you like
it I'm so excited that we are collabing
together yay okay so what
let me open it oh this is cool
oh this is some smithing call I just had
tried their nail polish fairly recently
it came in what did it come in I think
it came in my beauty lush lucky bag I
want to say but this is a cool color
it's called a shattered soles this would
be really pretty even if I didn't do
every nail but I did like that accent
nail with this this really cool gold
glitter intimate and cult packaging is
really cool you actually pop the top off
of this and then you unscrew this and
it's a nail polish thank you so much Kim
that's so cool this kind of shows you
what the gradable is so it's a little
box that you can take down and then you
can actually tear off these photos here
so just like this like I can tear this
off and hang it like on my desk
perhaps so that is really cool so you
can do a little personalized photos for
there you can do a message on there and
then they have different gift options
that you can add in there I believe I
sent Kim these little gummies from I
think it's sugarfina they are my
favorite thing in the entire world I
really hope that she likes so I'm going
to add in a gift for them as well and
then the cost just depends on the gifts
some gifts are less expensive some gifts
are more expensive and I believe that
you can also do a bonus gift now I've
been stocking the credible website for a
while after I found out because I just
think it's really cool but you can do I
think you can do now a bonus gift with
each one and so it kind of just depends
the cost of that depends on what product
you want to put in there but I think
it's super cute that is what the
gradable looks like I'm so excited
that's so cute and I'm really excited
about my nail polish so thank you to Kim
for sending that to me again I will have
a gradable listed down below with my
discount code I would love to know if
any of you guys have tried it yet and
what do you think about it are you like
me where you love personalized gifts
feel like I typically try to go for a
personalized gift whether it's for you
know a friend or a family member or
whatever I just think they're so special
I love the idea of photos I'm a big I'm
a big photo taker of course but I just
feel like it's really cool to get all
those those memories into one spot so I
was really excited about this thank you
to Kim and thank you degradable for
working with both of us so that is that
the first part of the video here showing
you my little greedy Bowl and then let's
the head over and try out some
Kym's favorite drugstore products I got
you guys noob didn't I got my ears on I
am ready to go I don't have a a product
for every single category I figured that
make a really long video some things of
her favorites I had already tried things
like that and I couldn't find some of
the some of the items I kind of find the
exact product that she was listening but
I tried to get something close to it and
still be able to try out some new things
but I am going to start with foundation
I did use the number 7 airbrush away
primer but for a foundation this is one
that I kind of had to tweak it a little
bit cuz I couldn't find her favorite in
stores this is from Rimmel London it's
the lasting finish 25 hour breathable a
long wear of foundation says high
definition finish and medium coverage so
her favorite that she had listed was the
one with the red cap and I know I've
seen a lot of people talk about it but I
could not find it in my CVS and I don't
think Rimmel's at Ulta anymore but they
did have like a very small section of
Rimmel at my CVS and this was the only
one I could find so I thought I would go
with it still to try it out because
Rimmel isn't a brand that I try a ton of
so I thought it would be fun to try a
new foundation from them I got the shade
in a soft beige it does say shake before
use so I'm gonna go ahead and shake it
up I didn't think it was a couple weeks
ago that I went out and bought the
products but I remember having kind of a
hard time picking out a shade because
they didn't have a ton there but let me
go ahead and open this up so it is oh
this is an interesting applicator so
this is what the applicator looks like
so that's pretty intriguing so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply this directly
to my skin with the wand I didn't keep
my receipt but I want to say this was
like seven or eight dollars at my CVS so
nothing too crazy it has a nice scent to
it actually like it actually it kind of
smells good okay so I'm gonna go ahead I
have my flower Beauty sponge I'm gonna
go ahead and pump that in definitely has
a fragrance to it it's kind of a bit on
the like floral side but it's kind of
sweet at the same time I don't mind it I
wasn't blending it out though like I can
really I can really smell it
alright so this is what it looks like
blended out on my skin I do have some
blemishes over here and I noticed that's
not quite covered all of it so I'm just
gonna go ahead and add just a little bit
more
to that section around my chin it does
say that it's medium coverage it kind of
looks on the light to medium side to me
right now but I just you know added that
one layer and I don't tend to go like
ham with my foundations and I am using a
Beauty Blender which sometimes Beauty
blenders does you know kind of not
sheared out but it just you know gives
you a little bit of a lighter coverage I
don't think the shade match is bad I
wish I didn't have to have my ring light
on today but I don't think the shape
match is terrible again I think I was in
soft beige I think that looks pretty
good
it is very does it safe or reasonable
yes it does breathable on here and that
is how I would describe it it is very
very lightweight on the skin I think
it's looking pretty good so far
I wish it would cover up just a little
bit more in this area but I will come in
with concealer and try to conceal those
nice hormonal breakouts and see how we
do but so far so good we'll see how it
lasts out the video I also did get a
concealer for this video this is from
NYX it's the HD studio photogenic a
concealer this is what it looks like
this was about five dollars I think I
got mine in the shade 0-4 beige beige is
the one that I picked up I was excited
to see this on Kim's list because I
actually almost grabbed this concealer
so many times I feel like I hear people
talk about it and review it and wear it
and such so when I saw this on the list
I was like yes I want that one and I
can't remember people have said this is
a dupe for some concealer but I can't
remember now what concealer it is so I'm
just gonna go ahead and put some on my
under eye and since I am doing face
first I'm just gonna use my concealer as
an eyelid primer as well and then I'm
gonna take my same a flower Beauty
sponge and blend it out one thing that I
noticed right off the bat was that it's
a not necessarily like really thick but
it was a bit of a drier formula that I
noticed right off the bat sometimes I
like something that's a little bit more
hydrating we'll go ahead and see how it
blends out okay while I was blending out
the concealer my camera actually
overheat it and shut off and then I kept
talking without realizing it so that's
awkward it also started snowing so
that's neat but I have the concealer
blended out and then I'm moving to the
eyes next so while my camera was cooling
down I did
bronzor and also blush and i did set my
concealer as well i think it looks
pretty good on the under eyes I felt
like beige was a good shade for me it
seemed to cover up pretty well I said it
with the RCM a no color powder and I
feel like it looks really good so far so
again we'll just kind of see how it goes
throughout the video and all of that
since all of this is a first impressions
I will come back and do a first
impression follow-up video I always do
that with my first impressions or like
my makeup hauls or things like that in
about two weeks or so I'll come back and
give a full review on everything so I
didn't want to let you know and that I
do that but so far so good like I said
it was just a little bit drier but it
was really easy to blend out so I'm
pretty happy with this I'm excited to
keep trying it out but like I said I'm
gonna switch over and suit the eyes next
so she had this elf palette on her list
this is the matte format eyeshadow
palette in summer breeze so this is what
it looks like I did notice that in most
places it's ten dollars but at my CVS it
was twelve not really sure what that was
about but I was really excited to give
this one a try and then it was after I
already had bought this palette I tried
out a different palette from ELF and I
had a really bad allergic reaction to it
like I tried it another time and I have
the same reaction to it so I'm a little
bit worried about this but my god just
give it a shot and see what happens so
the first time I wouldn't be using it so
we'll just see how it goes okay so this
is what the inside of the palette looks
like again this was $12 I feel like
that's I mean for all of these different
shades in here for a mirror I feel like
that's not a bad price at all so I'm
excited to play with this so let's see I
am just going to pick up the first shade
here and I'm using a real techniques
brush this is called the deluxe
concealer brush and I'm just gonna go
ahead and run that all over the eyelid
up to my brow bone and then I feel like
the purple is really calling to me in
this palette so let me see what I think
would be good I'm going to come into the
second shade which is just a pretty
neutral Brown I'm gonna use the Delhomme
tools a tapered blending brush and I'm
just going to apply that the outer part
of the eye into the crease and
work it in that looks brother I mean hey
like that looks pretty pigment it right
off the bat times the drugstore pellets
you know our pretty hit or miss but so
far so far so good with this one's
really hope I don't have any sort of
like weird reactions I wanted to make
sure I've filmed this like I'm filming
it on a Tuesday we do have some weekend
plans so in case I did have a reaction
uh uh have a couple days to get my eyes
to go back to normal but hey does I'd
give it a shot and then I'm gonna pick
up my Sigma e-40 for and I'm gonna grab
this shade right here so I'm just going
to place that on the outer part of my
eye once again dang that looks pretty
good and then I'm gonna slowly start to
blend it in about halfway into the
crease I have to say I'm I'm pretty
impressed the other one that I tried
from ELF I reviewed it recently in a
makeup monthly I put it in the fail
section not only because I mean it did
break me out but of course it's that's a
personal thing but I also said that it
didn't really seem very pigmented and
they said the shimmers in there weren't
doing much for me it's just kind of a
bit a bit hard to work with and so far
this is completely different than that
one I think that was called like the
nude Rose nude flush look it had the
word nude in it I did go a little bit
out of order a lot of times I'll start
with the eyes and then move on to the
face but I figured for the order of like
how I had products for this video that
it would just be easier to do because I
do kind of want to like clean up the
sides here you know just make it a
little bit smoother but I'm gonna wait
until the end to do that but I also will
say that I really don't see any fallout
okay just a like a tiniest bit over here
on this side other than that there's not
a lot of fallout which is fantastic so
next up I wanted to grab this purple I
like that this is an all matte palette
mMmmm just giving me the feels so I'm
gonna grab the sigma e55 and I'm gonna
take this beautiful like royal purple
and I'm just going to place this onto
the lid again I think I'll just have to
you know take a little bit of time to
build it up but it's not it's not
terrible
not terrible at all and I really since I
do have my face done I'm trying to make
sure I have any excess tucked off really
well but hey I think that looks really
pretty you moved in a little bit more I
like how that purple looks I'm gonna
take that stick of my brush and just
kind of blend everything together I like
that it's not like it's not like too
overwhelming or too intense I just took
a little bit to build it up I think that
looks really pretty so I'm just gonna
kind of blend everything out here and
again I'm I'll clean it up in a second
so it looks looks a little bit nicer
this is what the eyes are looking like
nothing it too crazy but I really like
how that purple looks I like how it
blended in with the other shadows so I
am pretty excited about that I did use
just a little bit of concealer and my in
my sponge just to kind of clean up the
outer edges so they don't look quite as
messy but I really like that I'm
impressed with this palette much more
than the other palette that I tried
recently so that has me pretty excited
my camera's gonna overheat again so I'm
just gonna do my brows off-camera and
then I'll finish off with this palette
and then I have some mascara and
highlight to try it as well so once I
get I'll be right back okay so I put
brows on and I added some nude liner to
my waterline so I'm going to come back
into the palette and finish off the
lower lash line so I think I'm gonna go
ahead
and what am I gonna do I'm gonna start
with this color right here and I'm going
to just use a pencil brush and smudge
that onto the lower lash line then I'm
gonna take a bit of the brown that I
used first and I'm just gonna do the
same thing and just kind of blend it out
and finally I'm gonna pick up a little
bit of the purple and I'm gonna put that
pretty close to the lash line and then
I'm gonna grab the first shade that I
put all over the lid and I'm just going
to take a smaller pencil brush and put
that into the inner corner and I'm also
going to highlight the brow bone with
this matte shade so that is it for the
elf Matt for Matt - palette and I am
super excited about this palette I'm
excited to use it more and play with
some of those other colors but just from
what I use today I'm very excited about
it
understand why this is one of the Kim's
favorites so yeah pretty excited about
this we'll see if I have a reaction to
it but who else has used the elf palette
and what do you think of it but I'm
going to go ahead and move on and put on
some mascara so I have the essence the
false lashes mascara this is a dramatic
of volume unlimited is what it says if
my hands are shaking it's because I need
to eat lunch we need to wrap this video
up so I can eat he says mascara for
fuller longer lashes for dramatic false
eyelash effects this was about $5 at
Ulta beauty and I'm excited to give it a
shot here's what the wand looks like I'm
not a big mascara person because I
normally wear lashes but everyone smile
my friend a mascara that I really love
so let's go ahead and see what I think
of this one so far so good for the
bottom lashes I can tell it's a bit of a
drier formula which sometimes is nice it
doesn't like transfer as easily so I'm
going to go ahead and try the top lashes
okay this is a one coat with the mascara
I feel like it's looking pretty good
I like how small the Wanda is like how
thin it is because I feel like I can get
right up underneath the base of my
lashes so I'm just gonna go ahead and do
two coats here way so mascara is on
here's what they look like I each have
two coats of mascara on I think it looks
pretty good it doesn't really make them
a very clumpy at all and I think it
helped with both length and volume
they're not as dramatic as my false
lashes of course but for five dollars I
think that's a pretty good mascara I
like how it linked into my lower lashes
as well so that's the essence false
lashes mascara so I also did pick up a
highlight that she recommended this is
from revolution Beauty a vivid baked
highlighter and this is in peach lights
so this is what it looks like this was
about six dollars so really beautiful
packaging in here looks pretty okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply this a to
my cheekbones I will say I went to Ulta
for the makeup revolution and it's now
called revolution Beauty and I was so
confused because I was walking around
Ulta for so long I was like I gotta
swear this was a drugstore brand but I
can't find it anywhere so makeup
revolution is now
Lucian beauty it took me way too long to
figure that out guys that's pretty
embarrassing story so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply to my cheekbones oh that's
pretty that's showing up really well
that's a really pretty shade too
woohoo oh that's nice it is showing just
a little bit of texture on my cheekbones
but nothing too bad it doesn't seem like
too powdery or anything there is what
the revolution and beauty and peach
lights highlight looks like that it's
really pretty who else has tried these
highlights and what do you think I'm
gonna finish off with a lip stick again
this is from Rimmel it's the lasting
finish by Kate or Kate Moss and I have
the shade 33 she had a couple different
shades listed as her favorite but my
again my room oh section in CVS was
pretty small so I picked out 33 cuz I
feel like it was like in-between her
favorites that she had in there but I
think there was only like 5 or 6 shades
to choose from so this is a pink I don't
know if it's gonna go with my look but I
probably should have looked at the
lipstick before I decided on my eye look
but we'll just go ahead and apply it
I've never tried these from Rimmel here
is what Rimmel 33 it looks like on me it
definitely doesn't match my eye look
because it's more of like a bubblegum
pink type of shade and actually kind of
smells like bubblegum I don't hate the
smell of this lipstick at all this was
about I think I was like 5 or 6 dollars
well let me see so I mean don't mind the
color isn't the best match but I do
still like this color I would still wear
it because it's not too bright it's not
like my standard pink but it's not too
bright it does look a little bit sheer
though like it's a creamy lipstick but I
feel like I can almost still kind of see
my lips through it so that's kind of
strange I might have to wear like a lip
liner with it underneath kind of
interesting but it feels really nice on
the lips like it's really comfortable
you know it's a creamy lipstick I can
see how it lasts I'm gonna eat lunch
after this so I can see how it lasts and
hold up and like I said I'll come back
and do a first impression follow-up for
all of these products but that is the
Rimmel Kate Moss lipstick in the shade
three three then after that that's going
to do it for my test
out Kym's drugstore favorites okay so
that's gonna be everything for today's
video and testing out some of Kim's at
drugstore favorites I feel like this
went over really well for me I feel like
I had a lot of products that I'm pretty
excited about and excited to keep using
if I had to pick like my top two maybe
it would definitely be the elf palette
and then also the nyx concealer has me
pretty excited I'm just a big concealer
junkie anyways so I'm pretty excited to
keep trying this one but other than that
I feel like a lot of the products have
been pretty darn excited so Thank You
