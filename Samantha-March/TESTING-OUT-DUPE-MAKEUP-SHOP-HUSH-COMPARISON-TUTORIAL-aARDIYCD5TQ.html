really excited for today's video because
I'm going to be playing with some of the
eyeshadow palettes that I received
recently from a shop hush I did a hush
haul a couple weeks ago on my channel I
will leave that one linked it down below
I just showed everything that was sent
to me from the website and I asked what
you guys would want to see and I got a
lot of really good feedback on here and
I just tried to take all the ideas and
basically put it into one video so what
I did for today's video is I first
compared the amount of Renaissance and
the bad habit Royals palette I also did
a comparison on the subculture and the
retro love like one eye with one pallet
the one eye with the other palette and
then finish it off I do not have a dupe
for this one this is a huda beauty dupe
but I did use at the bad habit Aphrodite
palette to create this eye look and I'm
showing you guys how these pellets have
worked out for me and the looks that I
created so I'm excited a bit of a
different type of video for me but I
hope that you guys like it or find it
helpful so if you want to jump into the
comparisons of why don't I go ahead and
get started so first I'm going to start
with the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance and then the Royals bad
habit so I'll be joining maddham maddham
renaissance over here and Royals over
here I do apologize if this video is
super super bright but we got a bunch of
snow it's still snowing right now and I
just film in front of my window to have
natural light and it is so bright
outside like I kind of want to be like
squinting put my sunglasses on because
there's a lot of snow out there well so
first up in the modern renaissance i'm
going to take the first shade which is a
tempura and i'm just going to use this
to kind of like set i have concealer on
I'm going to use the e43 from Sigma so
I'm just gonna take that and run it all
over the lids to kind of set the
concealer I have my face makeup done and
my brows it's gonna dust that brush off
and just use the same one and I'm gonna
come in it to Treasury from the Royals
palette and dust of that all over the
other eye okay so so far I mean that
looked pretty on par to the Anastasio
one but these looks I'm not planning on
doing anything like super crazy with
these comparisons
I'm just trying to see can we achieve
the same look like did they feel the
same look the same blend the same and
all of that so I'm not doing anything
like real crazy up in here today so from
Modern Renaissance I'm gonna take a raw
sienna and a sigma e25 and I'm just
going to put that into the crease and
it's going to slowly start to blend it
towards the inner part of the eye as
well it dipped back in one more time and
grabbed a little bit more I'm just gonna
do the same thing to kind of slowly work
up a crease color and I'm going to take
air from the Royals palette and a
different e 25 from Sigma and just same
thing on the left side just like I did
on the other side and write it back in
for a little bit more and slowly blend
it up I'm finding this one really easy
to blend as well and I think the pigment
looks pretty similar we got the crease
colors down still looking pretty similar
to me and then I'm gonna come back into
the modern renaissance I'm going to
switch brushes I'm gonna try keep my 825
separate for each palette in this one
and I'm just gonna build it up with a
little bit of realgar let's go in with
the orange cuz I really do like that
orange or the orange I'm just gonna
focus this one on the outer part of the
eyes I'm kind of patting it down and
then I'll slowly start to blend it I
know this orange is like super super
pigmented I use it ah this palette all
the time it's one of my favorite shades
in here but I know that you have to work
with a light hand with this one and then
from the Royals palette I'm going to
take a monarch down here this one
doesn't look like in the pan it doesn't
look as vibrant as the one from the
modern renaissance but we will see so
I'm going to grab my e25 for this side
and just Pat it on to the outer V and
then slowly start to blend it so even
though it didn't look like maybe it
would pack as much of a punch just
looking at it in the pan and actually I
feel like if showing up really well and
again easy to blend I think it's
looking pretty similar on both sides
there's not as much kick up in the
Royals palette as there is in the modern
renaissance you get quite a bit a kick
up what the modern renaissance but I'm
not really noticing that with the about
haba palette the amount of cake bag
doesn't bother me though and I don't I
have no fallout on my face at all from
either palette right now so kick open a
palette tends not to bug me but that is
something that I've noticed so I feel
like with this side I feel like it looks
more orange and this side it doesn't
want quite doesn't have like that orange
kind of rusty vibe that I feel like this
I has but still fairly similar and area
so started snoring so am I hear her
she's very next to me and then I do want
to use a shimmer shade summer show you
so I'm gonna go into the modern
Renaissance and grab out Primavera which
is one of my like all-time favorites and
this palette I'm going to use this Sigma
e55 and I don't have a damp brush or
anything and then I'm just going to pop
that onto lid it's really I'm gonna dip
Buchan twice I'll do the same on the
other side too but this is really just
one of like my favorite go-to looks with
those palette it's gonna take my big
fluffy brush it from Sigma this is the
e-40 I'm just gonna make sure that's all
blended together then from the Royals
palette I'm going to grab the shade
shade crown and I have the sigma e55
it's really similar to the e55 and again
not using a damp brush I'm just going to
play that to the lid and then I'm gonna
come back in a second time and apply a
little bit more grab thing at the e-40
just gonna go ahead and blend everything
this shimmer from the bad habit Royals
palette it's showing up a pretty good
but it's I don't think it has as much
room as this one I think if I were to
use a damp brush I could get the same
amount of pigment and you know kind of
shimmery goodness these are the shadows
that I wanted to try out for this look
so on the side we have Anastasia Beverly
Hills my Renaissance and on
the site we have the bad habit Royals
palette I felt like the first two shades
were pretty similar to one another but
then when it got to the orange I could
tell that this side isn't as vibrant as
the other side and then when it came to
the shimmer I feel like that's really
where I noticed a difference this side
with honest Asya is just like boom
shimmer it's there it's great on this
side I feel like it's definitely just
lacking I feel like I feel like the
Anastacio side looks like you know I
just put my makeup on and everything is
great and then the bad habit side kind
of is like I've had this makeup on for
10 hours eight hours and it's starting
to fade away that's kind of the
difference that I'm noticing between the
two but of course I would love to know
your thoughts as well but as far as the
Royals palette performing I mean that's
pretty good for I think this is the ten
dollar palette $12 palette I think it
performed really well and I think it is
worth the price tag but like going
head-to-head with the anasazi appellate
I still think I Nastasia palette is
better than the Royals but I don't think
that this one is bad at all it blended
easily you know things were showing up
well I didn't have any issues with
fallout you know anything like that but
comparing the two I would still say that
Anastasia takes this one but let me know
what you think in the comments down
below look number one comparing the
modern Renaissance and the Royals
palette so next up I want to compare the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills subculture to
the bad habbit retro love eyeshadow
palette here are what these palettes
look like so the bad habit palette is on
the top and then the Anastasia is on the
bottom so we will see I'm someone who I
do like the subculture I know not a lot
of people did I liked mine just fine
still reach for it it is a little bit
trickier to work with for sure
but let's just see what from the look we
can create with these two I'm going to
pick up the Sigma e-40 three and from
the subculture I'm going to pick up dawn
which is the second color I'm just gonna
place that all over the lid I put a
little bit of concealer back on and then
I'm just going to run this all over the
lid then from the retro love palette
grab the shade right here which is
called peace you use same brush and I'm
going to apply that all over the lid the
very first thing that I noticed just
dipping into that color is that it
doesn't have the crazy kick up that the
subculture does and a lot of people
didn't love the you know really like
powdery pigmented mists of the
subculture based on just dipping a brush
into one of the shades I did not notice
that with the retro love so I'm gonna do
a look of mine that's one of my
favorites from this palette that's what
I'm gonna go with today so I'm first
gonna come in with new wave which is
right here and I'm gonna take a sigma
e25 I just went and cleaned my brushes
and I'm going to tap into that one
pretty lightly and put this on the outer
part of my eye and then slowly start to
blend that one as well and blend it
towards the inner part of the eye and
then I'm gonna come in and grab the
shade a fab right here and take a
difference a 25 have that onto my brush
and then do the same thing just put it
on the outer part of my eye and then
slowly start to blend it justing from
using that color I actually feel like I
feel like I like it better than the
subculture I mean the subculture is just
so like a different formula wise like
you have to go into it differently with
it with a different mindset and I know
that that's that's an issue with it but
I kind of was like well it's fine
because like I like the different colors
and I like the uniqueness of it but I'm
I'm not really curious about retro love
because I actually like how that applied
better than myself culture I'm gonna do
next is take destiny which is kind of
like the olive green and I'm gonna put
that all over the lid I love this one
all over the lid so I'm gonna take the
sigma e55 and just tap it in there make
sure I tap it off then I'm gonna apply
destiny all over the lid I'm gonna dip
back into that one again tap it tap my
brush off and then apply all
the lid I'm gonna take the e54 and grab
out hippie is the name from the retro
love palette and I'm going to apply that
one all over the lid mix it back in just
like I did with the subculture and once
again apply its lid so it's kind of
crazy to me put having that matte green
down I am liking retro love more it just
is easier to work with I like the way it
blends better and I really like that
matte green like I okay I wanted to I do
want to do one more color and this is
just for like testing purposes I just
want to see how this would work I'm
gonna take electric from the subculture
palette I'm going to take my flat shader
brush again and I'm going to Pat that
into like the center of the eyes just to
see I'm just just curious now I know I'm
not really creating like full looks
either I'm doing like mascara or lashes
or liner and all of that but I really
just wanted to see how these two four
compared to one another lash was and you
know I'm also wiping my makeup off in
between each one so my eyes would just
be like so Roth I was also trying to get
mascara off and everything - okay so I
dipped in twice to electric come back
into retro love and take icon which is
the second shade so I'm not using a
setting spray okay
icon did some weird things you can see
but it kind of like tore up icon so
that's kind of subculture like with this
palette so that's kind of a bummer but
I'm gonna go ahead and in place icon wow
that's wow oh okay so I'm gonna dip in
twice just like I did with subculture so
we're keeping it consistent but Wow okay
okay so I'm not like super pleased so
that it kind of like tore up the shade I
think I was just since trying all the
other ones nothing was really kind of
like breaking up or being too powdery
but I can't
is so I'll just have to keep that in
mind for the other shimmers but this is
the look with subculture on this side
and the bad habit retro love on the side
and I I'm given it's a retro love this
round I really like the way that this I
came out better I'm I'm surprised I am
still surprised but if you want it
subculture because you liked the colors
had bands heard after a while because
you liked the colors and you thought
they were unique and all of that but you
kind of got nervous you know seeing the
reviews and you know a lot of people say
it's not the easiest palette to work
with which I do agree it's real it's
truly not the easiest palette to work
with ah this one yeah I would say go
ahead and get this one because that
worked out really really well for me
that's freaking awesome let me know what
you think in the comments of course
which side you like better what do you
think let me know but I I was gonna give
it to retro love anyway so then I was
like let me just put down one more like
this side pops with that with that
shimmery color this side it's like I am
impressed just so with this round retro
love gotta give it to it cool
so last time I am gonna create a full
eye look and I'm going to use the bad
habit aphrodite palette so this is what
the palette looks like this is a dupe
for the hood of beauty I think it's the
rose gold palette that this one is a
dupe for not have it has another one out
that's a dupe for the other huda beauty
palette as well but this is what the
Aphrodite palette looks like so I'm
excited to give this a try so I thought
since I didn't have the Buddha palette
to do a comparison I just do a full
complete eyelid come in with coy down
here on the bottom again I just grabbed
out the Sigma e-40 3 to apply this all
over the lid I did put more concealer on
I do not know how people do like live
swatches like I love watching the
Batgirl Shay XL and she does live
swatches especially with like color pop
where she puts just a ton of different
shades onto her lid and white blue wipes
them off and does it again I'm like my
eyes are raw after - after wiping them
off twice I'm like I can't do it anymore
my house
I'm gonna come in and grab at the shade
admire which is right here and my Sigma
e-40 and I'm just going to put that into
the crease as my first transition color
I was really excited to do those
comparisons though because I just I
wanted to see I felt like there was a
lot of feedback from my shop hush hall
video and these were kind of the items
that I saw the most of like definitely
people want I to toriel's they wanted to
see comparisons so I was like what could
I do to kind of combine everything I
mean you guys know that I post nearly
every single day I do either six or
seven days a week with a live chat as
well but I still have so many video
ideas to get to and I'm not really like
tutorial based channel I like to dish
sit and chat like I don't know that's
kind of what I prefer so I only do
videos like this maybe once a week
sometimes not even once a week and I was
just trying to figure out what I could
do because I didn't want to do just like
a bunch of videos like shorter videos
with comparisons cuz that's just not
really my style you know so I thought
maybe if I could do some quick little
comparisons just to to give an idea and
you know see for myself and then do one
kind of complete I look but that could
be a good idea so I know it's kind of a
different format but hopefully hopefully
you guys so like it cuz I'm trying this
one does have quite a bit of kick up in
the pilot if you can see from that shade
right there that I was using so that one
has quite a bit of pickup but that's
what I do kick up I just blow it off
Michelle does both I'm really really
attracted to this color called blushing
right here in the palate I think that
one is so pretty and I just want to use
it because I do it just it caught my
attention right away so I'm going to
take clean sigma e25 I have a ridiculous
amount of you 25 summer Sigma hat sung
on to my brush there and then I'm going
to work this on to the outer part of the
eye and bring it in I'm gonna be kind of
messy with this one I know I'm gonna
come in with a shimmer too but I just
thought that pink was so romantic and
pretty I really wanted to use it
so I'm gonna come back in and grab a
little bit more and just keep kind of
layering it on until I have it up to
where I want it to be well it's so
pretty again noticing a lot of kick up
with the shade as well but it's blending
very easily and it's showing up well and
it's so pretty I love this color there's
so many beautiful shimmers in here it's
so hard to pick one
I was first gonna go with crush right
here but I think I'm actually gonna do
this now it looks like just a little bit
more on the vibrant side but still that
beautiful you know pinky colors I'm so
into pink right now which is weird pink
on my eyes pink on my lips I am just
digging pink right now I'm gonna take
the cream color a 58 from Sigma it's
just like a flat shader brush I'm gonna
come in with no setting spray first like
I normally do when I work with new
palettes so I'm gonna pick up a little
bit on the brush here and then apply
this onto the lid okay so we're
definitely gonna need a setting spray to
try to help because that didn't really
do anything so hopefully the shows up
cuz it's so pretty in the pan I really
wanted to I wanted to be pretty on my
eyes too ah there we go you know
okay she's pretty she's pretty just
pretty but she has a lot of fall out
there's no bunch of fall out on my face
and it's kind of hard it's it's
interesting it's like kind of hard to
move around like once you put the brush
down it kind of just stays there and it
doesn't want to move so I don't love
this color as much as I thought I was
going to unfortunately it's kind of
weird to work with I don't know it's
just taking me a while to build it up
and make sure I'm getting it to where I
want I'll fall out on my face I'm really
kind of having to like dig into the
palette to get some on my brush but I
mean I like that end result I like the
color it looks really pretty so that's
good it's just it's just hard to work
with I'm just gonna take my e25 again
and kind of run it across here to make
sure everything is nice and blended my
eyes actually hurt like blending um how
do people do life's watching videos with
so many different shades my eyes are
it's so bad we're all so far with what
we've done I do like it
gonna overheat I'm going to wipe off my
face and apply some mascara and liner
and then I will come back in to finish
off with a few more shadows okay so I
added some a liner and mascara and I
also put on a lip color because I felt
really weird not having all that stuck
on at this entire time but I'm gonna
come back in to the Aphrodite palette
and just do some work on the lower lash
line I think I'm going to take a passion
first here in the middle with my Sigma
e30 pencil brush and just sweep that
along the lower lash line is really
pigmented Wow and then I'm gonna pick up
blushing again and sweep that onto the
lower lash line as well I love this
color I don't wanna do like an all matte
ayah with this color too I think that
would be really pretty so I'm just going
to add a little bit of color to the
lower lash line and I'm gonna take eight
different clean ether tea and I'm gonna
pick up crush which was like the
original color a thing about putting on
the lid but I'm going to add this one
into the inner corner for a little pop
of color over here mostly because I'm
still curious to see how it looks
oh that's really pretty oh I like that
after that then that's gonna do it for
this I look using the bad habit
aphrodite palette I hope that you guys
enjoyed the look that I came up with
overall I really do like this palette
and I think that it would be worth the
money the majority of the shades worked
out really well for me the shimmer I
just had to play with a little bit so
I'm excited to use some of these other
really pretty shimmers in here and just
see kind of how they perform but I mean
once I used a setting spray and just
took my time like no big deal um so yeah
I really like this palette I love the
colors in here I'm so excited to keep
playing with them I just think it's like
a really kind of like romantic looking
palette so hey I like this one I think
it came out pretty well you guys can let
me know what you think about this I like
in the comments you have this palette
yet but after our third eye look that is
going to do it for this video okay so
that is everything for today's the video
my eyes are like thank you thank you for
not wiping me off again but I really
hope that you guys enjoyed it or found
it helpful in some way it was really fun
to play with these different palettes
and see which ones I like more compared
to their do partner and then also
playing with the bad habit aphrodite
palette I think this one actually my
like have me the most excited and maybe
it's because I don't have a dupe for it
in my collection like I'm just really
excited to play with this one even more
and use it because I love the colors in
here and I'm excited to try it out even
more but then in for today's video I
hope that you guys enjoyed it and
enjoyed this kind of like format style
of video I know it's a little bit
different for me but I really wanted to
try to do as much as I could in a video
without like getting me too overwhelmed
but I hope that you guys liked it and of
course if you did I hope that you'll
give this video a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I will catch you guys
in at tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
