today's video I am going to be testing
out a some Instagram makeup hacks so I
love watching hack videos i watch that
I'm like all the time I think it's so
interesting and when I'm on Instagram
and I see these like crazy hacks coming
out I'm like those really work but
honestly like I never really feel the
urge to try them myself like I always
wonder like oh I wonder if that works
but I've been seeing some lately that
I'm like I actually do want to try those
out and I was going to the other night
like had some few things you set out I
was gonna try and I thought wait a
second why don't I make this into a
video these are videos that I really
enjoy watching so why don't I make one
myself so I did some more research on
Instagram so I could find a couple
different hacks to feature in this video
so I'm going to put them to the test and
see if I think that they work it's why i
have no makeup on my face right now
because as we keep going like i'll keep
putting makeup on four different packs
you know does that make sense but i'm
excited for like i said that these tech
videos are really popular but i don't do
them a lot myself because I've never
like really really like felt the pole
but i finally got the urge to try out
some of these crazy hats so excited to
film it but if you guys do like these
Instagram heck videos and trying out the
different hacks please do leave it in
the comments below because that can be
on the lookout for more hacks that I
want to try but I'm excited for this
video it's going to be something
different maybe I'll learn a few things
maybe some hacks will not go well at all
I truly have no idea but why don't I go
ahead and hop into hack number one we're
on a try is where you line your lips
with tape just like regular tape I
supposed to give you like a really good
liquid lipstick application so you can
put the tape like all over on your lips
and then when you apply the liquid
lipstick it's kind of like like the
eyeshadow trick or the winged liner tip
with tape on your eyes and then when you
take the tape away you'll be left with
like a great-looking lipstick
application I'm gonna try it this is one
that I really haven't curious about I
feel like it kind of seems like a pain
but tape all over your mouth and like I
don't have any makeup on right now
because I'm like why would I put Kate
like over my foundation
peel it away what if it takes my
foundation away so I don't know if I
think this is necessarily practical
because i usually do my lipstick glass
but I'm like you know what I'm going to
try it because especially with darker
liquid lipsticks it is really hard to
get like a good application I'm like a
very messy person so I'm just going to
go ahead and try it so I just have like
some regular and I'll scotch tape or
whatever so I think I'll do the thing
where you put it on the back your hand
first and then peel it off a couple
times so it's not quite so sticky when
you take it off so it doesn't hurt
that's what I do for when I do it on my
eyes and then I'm just going to place it
around my lips oh boy
look it's hard to place the tape because
I feel like I'm taping on my lip but
then if I go too low i'm like then my
lipstick is gonna look weird you know
so my final look here is my tape so what
I have to say about this hack is you
know clearly it didn't quite work like
there are some areas where you know I
didn't get the tape like super properly
but honestly it took me so long to apply
the tape it is immediately not worth it
to me like I'm someone who's always
looking to like save time and that was
definitely not a time saver and if you
don't place the tape exactly correctly
like you can see right here like I must
have missed a spot here I missed a spot
right there and then you're going to end
up like this like it's easier to me to
not waste the time doing tape and just
try to very precisely put the liquid
lipstick on or use a lip liner if I'm
really that worried about it so I get it
and honestly when I was pulling from
this side this side looked really good
and I was like wait a second is this
actually going to turn out pretty well
but if you missed any part with the tape
it's not going to look good and it's
just way to cut time consuming for me so
I get the heck but it's not going to be
one that I want to do oh the next hack
that I want to try is a new one that
I've seen floating around and I am I'm
like how do people come up with these
things like how are you just sitting
around you're like I have an idea I know
a way to make my makeup look completely
flawless and that is going to be me
putting powder all over my face and then
dunking my face and water how do you
even come to that conclusion I have no
idea but this is a new hack floating
around Instagram it's to get your most
flawless face so what you want to do is
prime your face and put foundation and
concealer on as normal and then like how
you would bake your face with powder you
put the powder all over your entire face
and then submerge your face and water
and it's supposed to give you a
completely flawless finish I have no
idea guys I did not come up with this I
think the first person that I saw do
this was and prettiness on youtube or on
Instagram I'm sorry I think she was the
first one that I saw but I don't know
sometimes i get a little uncomfortable
saying like I think this person should
get the credit because
never really know for sure and people
get really angry about it but as far as
i can tell that was the first one that I
saw doing it so i'm not saying i came up
with us cuz i don't even know how you
come up with stuff like this but i'm
gonna go ahead prime my face in my
foundation and concealer step my entire
face and powder and then dunk it into
water because why not like normal i'm
going to use my makeup forever smoothing
primer and for this hack it's really
important that you know you're only
doing these steps you're not going to do
your eye makeup or your eyebrows or
anything like that because then when you
would put your face in water obviously
they would get ruined so you're just
doing from what I've seen you're just
doing primer foundation and concealer
then you go in with the powder and get
weird okay so primer is on then I'm
going to use my L'Oreal True Match Lumi
and I'm just going to do a couple pumps
of that on my Sigma f80 brush like so
yeah I really have no idea what to think
of this like people on Instagram are
saying it works really well but I'm like
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna try it myself
and see what I think like what an
interesting way to get our makeup look
and flawless like what will they think
of next okay for concealer I'm going to
use my maybelline fit me i'm going to
buff that in with the morphe g2 I don't
know yet if I like how to fill me
putting my face in the water like I
think it'd be cool if I could actually
like show it but I have no idea how i
would do that was just me and a camera
like maybe if I had some help book
figure something out but it's just me
and my dog here right now so I don't
think she's going to be a whole lot of
help to me in this process okay so I'm
just going to take a damp Real
Techniques sponge and my Maybelline
master fix it's the loose setting and
perfecting powder so I'm just going to
apply a layer of that all over my face
bad like using this much powder that so
I went for my Maybelline versus my Laura
Mercier because it's a little bit less
expensive because I feel like I'm
already running low and I'm probably
gonna have to buy a new one after this
hack have the layer of powder all over
my face I went like heavier on my under
eyes cuz that's like where I normally
like go heavy on the powder I don't I
don't know but I have a lair all over my
face and now let me go knock my face and
water hmm BRB
it's cold why did I use warm water
I'm a little wet so I'm just trying to
like Pat myself to not you know you
don't want to like wipe because I feel
like that would defeat the purpose but
uh okay so first thing that I learned
was that the water was really cold like
use warm water why didn't I use more
water that was really like I stuck my
head it was like no no that's cold okay
so otherwise I mean you know obviously
it wasn't bad so okay so i still like
some powder residue here and there so i
guess i'll try to wipe that off but the
assist oh man that was weird okay but
let me see i mean i mean i don't know i
mean it i guess i don't know I thought
when I like stuck my face in the water I
just assumed that like it would take the
makeup away you know I mean obviously
does anyone else think that but I mean
it definitely still looks like i'm
wearing makeup i need to brush away the
extra powder but like I can still see
what it I mean it honestly it does it it
looks like I'm wearing foundation you
can tell this is weird no way okay let
me brush it with powder I'm just using
my Sigma sweeper brush to brush away the
rest of the powder okay so honestly guys
this is bizarre to me but I think it
actually worked like my skin still looks
great I still have some powder but say
you could probably use a light hand with
the powder like I went harder on my
under eyes cuz i just did and like
that's where I need to be sleeping it
away but I mean it still looks like i
have my foundation on which is awesome
and it also looks more full coverage
like the l'oreal the True Match limit
that I used I don't think is necessarily
like a full coverage foundation and now
it almost looks more full coverage but
like that is in
singing that is weird okay so i don't
know sometimes I think I'm bad at first
impressions because I'm like staring and
try to trying to figure this out but
like I actually do think this one worked
and that blows my mind but it looks good
it does it looks flawless it looks full
coverage well color me surprised but uh
okay i think i'm gonna have to give this
one win I mean it wasn't hard to do like
I feel like you're gonna waste a lot of
powder which I don't necessarily love
like I don't know maybe if you have a
vent where you need full coverage and
you need like a flawless finish I you
know dunk your face in water and there
you go it wasn't like super duper
time-consuming I probably was you know
submerge for like 20 seconds or so you
know obviously like can't really hold my
breath that long but and I don't um two
times if you don't count the first time
where I got scared the cold water but it
wasn't really time consuming the only
thing I would say is that you might feel
like you're wasting you know powder but
I actually think this one works and I'm
surprised I've done a little bit more of
my makeup and like applying bronzer and
blush they went on easily I mean that
water trick hack thing kind of blowing
my mind but we're going to switch focus
and we're going to work on the eyes next
I have two different like eyelash hacks
that I want to try the first one is one
that I immediately gain like a ton of
popularity I have no idea who first
started this one guys I don't know
because I feel like once it started
everybody was doing it so I'm not sure I
don't want to give credit to the wrong
person if you guys know who started it
the event of the comments below and I
can put in my description box of what
we're gonna do is we're going to apply
false eyelashes underneath our eyes that
I'm a little freaked out by this I'm a
little hesitant but this was really the
the hack that started this video idea
for me so I was like does that work
because I you know I hate it when you
can see the lash band or you can see
like the lash
blue or like you just you just notice it
with your false lashes but they're
saying if you put it underneath your
eyelash it looks like totally natural
well the eyelashes stick well it hurt
well look funny I don't know but I'm
going to find out so in the videos
mostly they were using like individual
false lashes and then just placing them
where they wanted them to have any
individual lashes so I just took like an
old pair of our dell like demi wispies
that probably need to be thrown away and
I just cut them up into different
sections so we will try it like that i
don't know if i will talk a lot while
applying them because it's probably
gonna freak me out enough as it is but
i'll see you guys in and we'll just see
how it goes
you
as honestly I'm sorry to say but I think
like I cannot do this hack I was so
excited about it and so excited to try
it's so painful my eye is like watering
and stinging when I was putting the
first lash on there I was like this is
uncomfortable it hurts I don't know I
don't understand why people are doing it
I tried placing it in different areas
seeing if it would help nothing really
helped I don't like I don't like this um
it just it freaks me out it didn't feel
good it wasn't comfortable I don't like
to tack at all I don't even want to like
continue to try doing it with other
pieces of the lashes and then different
areas it just was painful I even tried i
was like maybe like the inner you know
corner is Mew nope hard like that's
where it's hard to put lashes normally
so I even tried going more toward the
outer part like they didn't stick very
well I had a lash fall into my eye like
this was a complete disaster so many
people are doing it on Instagram so
clearly other people are making it work
for them maybe I'm too much of a
scaredy-cat with things around my eyes I
don't know but I tried different areas
to put the lashes like I was like maybe
I'm putting it too close to my eyes so I
put it farther back it just it didn't
work my like my eyes are sticking
together right now because there is lash
glue like on them and this is going to
be super annoying like I was really
excited for that one because that
everyone looked like they had such like
natural pretty lashes but that's not
worth it to me that hag is a huge fail
for me if you guys have done this and
tried it let me know if you have tips
and tricks but I can't get over how
painful that was and just like how
uncomfortable that was I don't really
recommend you to try it but uh I thought
it would be a fun one to try i clearly
thought so incredibly wrong like that
hack huge fail I am back I actually took
about a three hour break that hat like
has me all sorts of confused I went back
I watched more Instagram videos of it I
made sure as placing the lashes in the
right spot you know I thought maybe
because I'm trying to do it on camera
working out the bus I did off camera I
tried different areas i tried different
lashes i tried different lash glue i
tried a difference at the tweezers i
tried my fingers nothing was working but
the biggest problem was was that it was
irritating my eyes too much that's why i
had to take the longest the longer break
also I keep like you know checking out
my foundation and how my face looks guys
it's still it looks good and like also
the weird thing to like it's not cakey
it's not patchy it's not like it's not
any sort of strange but even I was at
drinking coffee and I spilled coffee on
myself because I I do that nearly every
time I drink coffee which is everyday I
spilled coffee on myself so I had some
coffee on my chin and I took a napkin
and kind of padded it away and when I
looked at the napkin usually I have some
sort of like foundation residue on the
napkin and there was none I was like
whoa so that hack just has me like crazy
right now I think I'm probably gonna do
it again because I was so crazy but
moving on just give you guys that
updates on those hacks so we're gonna
move on to the next hack which involves
mascara and baby powder so apparently
what you do is you put mascara on your
lashes like normal then you dip your
mascara wand into baby powder and apply
that to your lashes and then you come
back in and put mascara on as normal so
you kind of sandwich baby powder in
between your lashes and it's supposed to
give you like really long nice looking
lashes without having to wear fake
lashes so though I was a little confused
about like you know what is my mascara
are gonna be ruined because I'm putting
in a baby powder like am I going to be
able to use my mascara again so I
grabbed out my Lancome Hypnose drama
mascara um it's just a little sample of
it and it's pretty much done for anyway
so I was like well I'll just use this
one versus like a new like expensive
just opened mascara and then I picked up
some we don't have any baby powder cuz
we ain't got no babies but think of some
baby powder at the grocery store the
other day and I just put some in this
like a little Tupperware thing because I
didn't know where else to put it so
that's what I did so I'll do one lash
and so we can compare them and see what
it looks like so I'm just going to go
and apply my mascara like I normally
would to my top lashes I think I'll just
do my top lashes to start off with just
to see okay so i just did one coat so
here's what my lashes look like this one
has mascara this one doesn't just one
coat of mascara so now i'm going to dip
my wand and coat it in the baby powder
this feels wrong feel so wrong so here's
my boy juan looks like what the baby
powder in it and then you just apply
this to your lashes that's just the
skills you don't feel weird okay so I
was worried okay well yeah the fall its
kind of happening at first it wasn't but
um there's a bit of fallout but keep
going it doesn't make my lashes like
really white like when you use an
eyelash primer and it's white like I
mean you can tell my lashes aren't as
dark but they're not like dark white so
I'm just making sure get all of them
with the baby powder okay so here's what
my lashes look like now they have the
baby powder on them this one is still
completely bare I'm just going to take
like a little cloth and like try to
remove um the baby powder so I'm just
gonna try to carefully like Pat it off
with a dry wipe okay so now the true
test I will apply the mascara so my
lashes feel normal like they don't feel
like dry hard anything like that like
they feel like my normal lashes I
actually I think that's pretty good
right so I'm going to put just mascara
on this I and then we'll compare to give
the focal person so there is no more
baby powder on my wand it is completely
off so just go ahead and do my mascara
layer over here and then we will do a
side-by-side comparison okay so here is
the comparison of my lashes I actually
oh my poor little finger I actually do
think is there a difference oh yeah I'm
just looking in the mirror right now
like I think
they they look a little bit fuller maybe
not necessarily like any longer but I
think they just look a little bit
thicker so you know do I think this hack
works I guess so I also think it's kind
of messy um I wouldn't want to like be
dumping out baby powder all the time and
like having to clean off the wand to dip
it back in the mascara so I feel like
time consuming and cleanliness like are
going to be factors of why I wouldn't
want to do this because the end result
is so like it's so similar to one
another like there's just just barely a
difference so to me yeah it works but it
doesn't work good enough that I think
that this could like really be
considered a win if that makes sense but
that was fun to try oh this is going to
be our last hack and it's going to be
how to make like DIY metallica lips so
the metallic lips are you know really
popular right now everybody is coming
out with a metallic lip but apparently
there is a way to DIY it so we're going
to give it a try basically what you do
is you put your liquid lipstick on like
normal and then you can do like I saw
videos where people used I shadows and I
also saw where they used highlighters so
I pulled out my very first highlighter
mary-lou manizer from the bomb and I'm
going to place that on top of Sal oh
when my favorite lippies from colour-pop
it's just a really nice pink and we're
gonna see what we get so I'll zoo me in
and we'll give it a try all right I have
sallow on my lips and I'm just going to
take my ELF small tapered brush and
apply my mary-lou manizer from the bomb
whoa cool haha that's awesome
ok guys here is my final look with my
DIY metallic lives I feel like that
actually worked out really really well
ok guys so here are my DIY metallic lips
using color pop sallow and mary lou
manizer from the bomb cosmetics that
really works I mean obviously I've seen
a lot of people do this DIY trick and I
thought that can't be too hard right but
honestly that was so super simple and
you can go like I started out light and
I was like you know what that looks good
house like no I want more though so I
went in more and mary lou manizer is
more of like like almost like an icy
vanilla type of highlight but like I
want to try more I want to try it with
champagne pop I want to try it from some
of my Anastasio glow kids I really want
to try this with like the sweets cloak
it because I have that sassy grape
highlight and I feel like that could be
cool to pair with a liquid lipstick I am
totally trying this more like don't feel
the urge to go out and buy all these
other metallic lipsticks just mix in
with what you have like this is awesome
i love love love how this came out i'm
very impressed with this hack i'll
definitely be trying it more again I
applied my highlight with the elf small
tapered brush I also applied it pretty
quickly because you know liquid lipstick
does dry down pretty fast so immediately
after i got the lipstick on i went in
with the highlight so that might have
something to do with it I probably
wouldn't recommend waiting too long to
apply the highlight because I don't know
if it would like stick as well but this
is a hack that I'm giving a big thumbs
up to this hack and the water dipping
hat or probably my favorite out of all
of them to be everything for my testing
out weird Instagram hacks I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video found
it helpful informative maybe somewhat
funny I don't know I just hope that you
enjoyed doing it I enjoyed putting these
hacks to the test some of them were mega
fails but some of them we're mega
awesome hacks if you guys want to see
more of these in the future just let me
know like I said it's not something I do
on the regular but there
a few of these that I really wanted to
try out for myself and I'm actually
really glad that I did because I found a
couple tricks that I feel like I can use
in the future so if you want to see more
hex videos please leave in the comments
below if there's any specific hacks that
you've seen that you would want me to
test out leave those in the comments
below as well and I will check into
those but thank you guys so much for
