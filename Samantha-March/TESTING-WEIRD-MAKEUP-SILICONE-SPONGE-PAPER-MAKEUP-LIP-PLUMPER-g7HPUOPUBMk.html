today's video is going to be a little
bit different from what I normally do
because today we are going to be testing
out some weird makeup I have three
different items here that could be
considered weird strange or just on the
different side of the makeup and beauty
items that I would regularly be using so
I am going to be testing out these
products for the first time on camera
letting you know what I think letting
you know if I think that they work the
three different items were going to be
talking about the first one is going to
be a silicone sponge I feel like
everybody has used these and try these
and I finally got my first one I also
have some paper of makeup I've been
seeing a couple videos on this mic tour
going around and I have a blush and
highlighter and they are paper so we're
going to try those out and see what
those are like very curious about this
and then the last I'm going to be trying
out of a little bit nervous but this is
the candy lips lip plumper so this apple
looking device goes on my lips such as
them and it's supposed to make lips
thicker oh this is going to be an
interesting video I have not tried out
any of these products yet so this is
going to be all first impression so why
don't we just go ahead and jump into the
video I see we have just some makeup
done I have my eyeshadows liner and
lashes on there's the only makeup I have
done because everything else when I'm
doing is going to be face and/or lips so
the first thing that I'm going to be
trying is for my foundation and
concealer this is from get into the
limelight it is their silly slice the
original glitter silicone sponge okay so
here is a close-up of what that looks
like so from the back it says that it
perfectly applies and flawlessly blow
into your foundation blush highlighter
and concealer without absorbing one drop
if you apply about half the amount of
liquid or cream that you would use with
a brush or a sponge and spread evenly on
your face because they say brushes
and/or makeup sponges can really absorb
the product so you have to use more
product when you use them so with the
silly sponges you're supposed to be able
to only use half of the amount of
product since it's not being absorbed
and when the gal emailed me she did say
about like the unique a teardrop shade
to help get into the smaller areas and
it is glitter so that's fun so this is
what it looks like it's smaller than I
thought it was going to be I described
out my L'Oreal True Match Lumi one of my
favorite foundations
I do have Smashbox photo finish primer
water on my face is going to go ahead
and do a couple pumps on here about half
of what I normally would do then oh I
should put my hair back oh that's okay
so then I'm just going to tap this on my
face like I normally would and then
start to tap it in
so one thing that I noticed right away
is that when I tapped it on to my face
like how I would normally do my
foundation I was like oh that's not
going to be enough I'm going to need to
add more but definitely as I'm blending
out the foundation I'm realizing that I
might have actually even used too much
like it seems sweet blending in fairly
well actually but I even could have used
less foundation so it feels fine on the
face like I don't notice anything funky
about it I think I almost like maybe the
size of its smaller I feel like I've
seen bigger ones and I feel like when
people do what they like complain about
the noise like the slapping on their
face I hear nothing but I mean that
blended out very quickly and I think my
foundation looks pretty good actually
huh I mean I feel like so many people
have done reviews on these and I mean a
variety of different types of items that
like these and I mean heck even a like
chicken cutlet that you would put in
your bra I mean people are doing all
kinds of crazy things but I just never
did and I wasn't sure like I feel like
with these in particular like I've seen
so many different like some people just
absolutely hate them to understand them
and some people love them like I have
friends who I watch their Instagram
tutorials and it's not even that they're
using this to read
they just are using it because they
enjoy the product dipping at my face up
close I mean my foundation one thing
that I went worried about was maybe it
wouldn't be as blended out but I think
that looks pretty darn good I did like
the shape of it because like around my
nose I could fit into those areas pretty
easily that was quick that was easy I
definitely did not use as much product
as I would with a brush or a makeup
sponge so okay so I'm going to see how
it goes with concealer so I'm going to
grab some concealer I'm sorry before my
job starring this entire time she's
right next to me just full-on dramatic
snoring okay so so far so good
let me grab some concealer and we'll
give that a try next we're to try
concealer I have my Maybelline fit me
here so I'm just going to apply a little
bit underneath my eyes also to the
center parts of my face and we will see
how this does I'm pretty excited though
because I don't know I had my I had my
doubts just because I really wasn't sure
how this could really like blend in your
makeup but so far so good feel like the
shape really does help it out here
because I can get right up in to my eye
and right underneath those lashes and I
mean it blends it out so fast and I
guess that was another thing that I
wasn't really expecting I thought it was
going to take like a lot of time to
blend out but it is super super quick
but pretty awesome okay so I have my
concealer all blend analysis as well and
for my first impression I'm gonna have
to go ahead and get this a thumbs up
which has me really really excited so
definitely the first thing that I
noticed is that you really do only need
about half of what you normally would
for your foundation or concealer or
whatever makeup product you're using
because it does not absorb it all into
this I think it works really well if
blended out super fast I do like the
shape I like how small it is it was easy
to hold it was easy to use I didn't feel
like it made any sort of like weird
noise
on my face I liked the teardrop shape of
it too so I could get right up in there
underneath my eye so all of that was
great it's must be really easy to wash
and so on you can just use like mild
dish soap and just some warm water to
wash it so suppose to be really easy to
wash which i think is great really I
feel like the only con that I can think
of it or it's not even a con if I were
to compare it to a makeup brush and then
also a makeup sponge what do I think
right off the bat again this is my first
impression but off the bat I think I
actually would say that I would like
this more than a makeup brush since I
really started getting into makeup
sponges and finding the makeup sponges
that I like the best I definitely have
declined I'm using my makeup brushes
because I feel like makeup sponges just
really give you like a very flawless
almost like airbrushed type of face like
that's what I think when I use a makeup
sponge and sometimes with makeup brushes
I just don't feel like they do as good
of a job as the makeup sponge so that's
why you typically see me using makeup
sponges so I would actually classify
this as I like it more than my makeup
brushes I think it goes quicker then
using a makeup brush and I like the
finish more but I still don't think that
finish is as good as a makeup sponge
like I don't feel like it's making my
face like super super like I have that
flawless finish that I feel like I get
with a makeup sponge with my morphe
flawless sponge or my L'Oreal sponge or
my Sigma 3d HD blender those are
probably my favorite sponges and I just
really really love like no matter what
foundation I'm using I just really like
how they make my face look I think this
is pretty darn close like it's up there
it's up there but I still would think
that the makeup sponge is better but I
think I actually like it better than a
makeup brush based off my first
impressions so this one a big win that's
awesome that is so cool I'm really
excited I got to try this out I'm get
into the one that I did send this to me
they are not sponsoring this video this
is not as much a video but they did send
this to me and they also did give me a
discount code I was going to wait until
I tried it out because of like wolf I
don't like it
I'm a fraud s compo at you guys but I
actually really did like this so that's
really cool I'm it's just Samantha and
you get 20% off so I'll leave it link
down below to the website if you want to
try this yourself and see what you think
of it has anybody else tried any sort of
the silicone sponges and what do you
think do you love them do you hate them
I feel like with these and the reviews
icing it's either one or two things you
love it or you hate it you're going to
use it or you're not going to use it
adult so for me personally I have to
give this one a thumbs up and that is
super cool so hopefully my feedback and
being able to see it applying my
foundation concealer I hope it helps you
out in case you were considering getting
one but I have to say that I approve of
these so that is frickin awesome so the
next thing that we're going to try I'm
very serious about these are from my
couture and like I said and the intro of
these are paper makeup I have seen a
couple of videos out about these so when
they asked if I would like to try them
out I was like yes please so these were
sent to me from my feet or if you have a
blush in here those lightly powders with
paraben free Intel free pigment mica to
our blush paper instantly gives the
complexion of booths of shimmering to
you on the go no messy brushes or shadow
prod makeup required so this is what the
little booklet looks like and then when
you open it up you have your blush this
is super super interesting to me so
obviously I'm so curious about this okay
you can see this is the colored side
that is the non colored side and then so
you just rub it like this I guess okay
okay I can see color you can see color
oh yeah I can really see color I don't
know how well you can see on camera but
yeah okay so that's working but I feel
like maybe it's like taking my
foundation off spell because can't see
the paper like that's brown so that's my
foundation okay
have to use a free pretty firm pressure
when I first started I was kind of just
like lightly tapping I mean I definitely
see color it's working
learn I mean it looks like I have blush
on my cheeks I'm sure but I do kind of
feel like it's
taking off my foundation so let me try
the other cheek I have the blush on both
my cheeks I mean I feel like I can
definitely tell that I have a blush on
but like I've been saying I just feel
like it's rubbing away my foundation and
I don't I don't really enjoy that
because I feel like now it's made it's
made like splotchy marks on my face so
cute and this is what my sheet looks
like at the end so I mean I was kind of
worried about foundation that's why at
first I was just tapping it because I
didn't want to move around the
foundation but then you're not getting
any blush you're not getting the product
on your face
so when I rub it then you get the blush
but then it takes away your foundation
so that's kind of a bummer but let's
open the highlight one and see what
that's about
when my camera is cooling down I did
just finish off my eye makeup from so
now my concealer on and I put on some
brows so now we're going to try the
highlighting paper from my tour this is
in I think it's in the shade Saint Barts
so when you open it up these are what
the highlight sheets will look like so I
got my highlighting sheet you can see
which side highlight and which side is
not going to go ahead and apply this
first to the top of my cheekbones and
I'm going to start by trying to press
lightly like with the blush if I press
lightly nothing happened so then I had
to press firmly which move the
foundation but with the highlight a
highlight actually showing up that's
actually really good the highlight is
showing up a really really nicely and
I'm barely barely touching the paper to
my face whew okay okay I like this that
is cool and all coming from a sheet of
paper that's cool and you can see the
close-up here like it's not really
taking off any of my other makeup so let
me do it to the other side that I feel
like now something weird is happening
hold on let me zoom you in so I look
what how what does that do it must
been taking the blush off too because
now the blush is in like a weird pattern
or maybe just the blush wasn't good to
start with and now it's making the
highlight look weird but I don't like
the way that looks I don't like I don't
like what this is doing and there's I
just oh no oh I thought we were on a
good track mMmmm not sure about this so
I thought we were getting somewhere with
the highlight but I feel like it's just
doing weird things to press a little bit
down the center of my nose but yeah it
is it's it's doing the same thing as the
blush shoot I thought it was really
working out but man I really liked the
idea and I liked the concept of the
paper makeup I thought it was
interesting especially in the summertime
I was like these could be really easy
like a special for the highlight I was
like that could be really easy to throw
in my clutch and just like top highlight
on what I wanted to and not have to
worry about using my fingers using a
brush I think a highlight that could
like shatter in my clutch but
unfortunately actually putting it on my
face just doesn't really work out it's
breaking up my makeup it just doesn't it
just doesn't really look that good so oh
shoot that bums me out but unfortunately
I like the idea I like the concept and a
big thank you to my couture for sending
it to me but this is not going to be for
me mmm bummer
so the final item we're going to try is
from candy lips and it is their lip
plumper so it looks like an apple
packaging super cute so this is the box
that it came in so that was pretty fun
it says pouty lips you always wanted
need it naturally so it's supposed to be
like basically getting lip injections
but temporary so I am super curious
about this it came with a whole packet
of like instructions care how to prep
your lip so what could happen after your
lips warnings and I'm not going to lie
the warnings kind of have me freaked out
because they say that you can get like
cupping or even bruising around your
lips that should last for four to seven
days
that has me a little bit scared but I
would say definitely if you if you see
what happens here and you like it
I'll have the website listed down below
just go and check it out and read
through all of the warnings and such and
make sure that it would be for you I
have not used this yet so I don't know
if it's going to work for me I don't
know if it's going to be like I'm scared
to meet painful but I want to give it a
try because I'm not really interested in
getting lip injections anytime soon it's
like yeah I want to have bigger fuller
lips but you know just for like a day I
don't need to go stick needles in my
lips because that sounds incredibly
painful to me and what you're supposed
to do is squeeze it to compress it and
then put it and then POW and put it on
your lips like that and hold it for two
minutes but this is really hard to
squeeze like I'm having a rough time
trying to squeeze this thing in so I
think I got it so go ahead Nick's pouty
face
it's been two minutes and so you're
supposed to like gently like wiggle it
off I feel I feel something it doesn't
hurt it didn't hurt at all throughout
the process
it doesn't hurt now it's not it doesn't
it's not painful it's what I'm trying to
say but it definitely feels like
something I can see like a little ring
around my top lip and tingles but I
don't know if I can see like a real yeah
actually I can I can tell there it's
definitely a little bit plump or like it
almost looks I would say it almost looks
like swollen is what it kind of reminds
me of so I don't know I guess it works
at some people because I've seen a
couple videos and some people in when
they pull it off their lips are like
huge and some people say that it takes a
while I feel like my blush and
highlighter looks crazy like I can't
stop looking at it
but other people say it takes the
computers to notice anything so that was
fairly easy the hardest part honestly
was compressing it yeah I could
definitely notice some fullness though
so that's pretty cool I've been hanging
out for a few minutes just kind of
seeing how my lips for doing it still no
pain or anything like that which I'm
very grateful for because I honestly was
a little bit freaked out they do feel
almost like a little tight like I can
feel like a tightening effect happening
with them but especially my bottom lip
to me I can tell a very noticeable
difference my top lip yes I can see a
difference but not as noticeable as my
bottom lip so I do have to say that I
think that the candy lips the lip
plumper really does work would I
recommend it I mean yes I would because
I do think it works I thought it was
fairly simple to use again the hardest
part was just squeezing it in and I
didn't find it to be painful on the lips
which i think is great I don't think
that it really needs to be for everybody
if you have pretty full lips already
you're not going to need it and if you
do have lip injections lip fillers
you're not supposed to use this I did
notice that in the little sheet of paper
that came with it I would definitely say
for something like this though you know
I'll have to website lists down below
you check it out yourself read over
right like the warnings and everything
like that but I did I'm actually kind of
glad that I did because for to take two
minutes to use this and to feel no pain
and to get a little bit of a fuller list
I think that's pretty cool actually so
friends ever a time where I would want a
fuller lip I now know that I can just
reach for this so I think that's pretty
awesome but yeah I could definitely
notice again especially with my bottom
lip that is a little bit bigger but
after testing out this little guy that's
going to do it for this video
whoo we made it through again so that's
going to do it for my testing weird
makeup video I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video to wrap it up I would
say definitely my favorite thing out of
the three that I tried was the silly
slice the silicone sponge from get into
the limelight
this was definitely by far my favorite
that I tried it thought it did a really
good job it worked quickly it blended in
makeup quickly and I actually really got
along well with this product these I
believe are you can get them in a two
pack I do have another one like this
it's a clear one it has the glitter in
it too so you can get the pink and the
clear one blues they're $36 for the two
but I'm looking on the website right now
and they are on sale for $29.99 so I'll
have it listed down below I'm not sure
how long the sale will last but I do
also have that discount code for 20% off
which is Samantha and I definitely did
like the lip plumper as well even though
I was hesitant about it I'm really glad
that it wasn't painful it didn't hurt
and that it was very simple to use and I
actually do see a difference right away
with it
so I will definitely be trying this out
again in the future yeah if you are
looking for some sort of like natural
lip plumpers you don't want to go the
injections or filler routes this could
definitely be a good option also looking
on the candida lips website it looks
like these usually run like this size
usually bronze for $69.99 they are on
sale right now for $49.99 I'll have it
linked down below again not sure how
long the sale will last um this was sent
to me via octoly which is the website
that I talked about pretty frequently it
links bloggers and brands if you're a
blogger if you have a YouTube channel or
an Instagram you can sign up for it and
you get sent products to test out in
like a review video or to review on your
Instagram so that's always link down
below and then the probably that didn't
really work for me unfortunately was
from my
- our supers I believe we're going for
$15 and then the highlights papers were
for 1850 sheep fortunately these were I
was in a really big fan I look like my
blush and highlight is looking a little
on the crazy side right now like the
idea of them think it's very cool and
innovative instant really work for me
which is the bummer but hey two out of
three that's not so bad especially for
like a first impression type of video
this could have gone like way horribly
wrong so I'm actually pretty happy with
this video I hope that you guys enjoyed
it and enjoyed seeing me test it out
