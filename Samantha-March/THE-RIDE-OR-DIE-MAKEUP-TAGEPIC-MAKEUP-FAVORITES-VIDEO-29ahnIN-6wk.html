so today's video I'm going to be doing
the ride-or-die and makeup tag so I saw
that Jaclyn hill created this tag video
the other night and I thought it will be
a lot of fun I love filming favorites
videos and they're like just some of my
favorite to film I love being able to
share things that I absolutely love and
to me this was kind of like the ultimate
makeup favorites tag and so I thought
why not do it I of course asked my
snapchat fam first if they wanted to see
it and got so many screenshots so I
decided well why not film it so
basically I'm going to be going through
each like makeup category and showing my
favorite favorite thing I'm really
excited to share this with you I have a
couple categories that Jaclyn did that
I'm not going to do and then I have a
few I think maybe just one that she
didn't do that I will do but you kind of
have to make this tank your own and okay
so first up we're gonna talk about
foundation and I kind of went back and
forth a little bit so I feel like you
guys probably know that I love L'Oreal
and I love Maybelline and I was like
which one do I feel like I truly like
could not live without but honestly once
I really thought about it I knew that it
was a L'Oreal The True Match Lumi
foundation is just it's amazing it is my
favorite hands-down I recently went
through my foundation collection because
I did a full video on it and I actually
went back and re-watch that video and I
was listening to what I was saying about
each foundation but I was like no I mean
it is it is the Loreal foundation I love
this stuff I know for sure when I run
out of this I'm going to have to
repurchase it I have it on today it's
just my favorite foundation and I
actually picked this up from
recommendation from Jaclyn hill like one
of her videos way back in the day she
raved about this foundation and I was
like I'm gonna go buy it and I did and I
loved it but I realized actually that I
forgot to touch on primer I don't feel
like I have a writer dye primer so I'm
not gonna mention one like I have plenty
of primers that I like just fine but
half the time I forget to prime my face
seriously honestly I do how's the time I
just get so excited to do my makeup I go
right in with my foundation and I'm like
for doubt the primer I try not to but it
happens but yeah I don't feel like I
have a ride-or-die primer so that's why
I skipped
that one but getting back on track when
it comes to concealer of course of
course I did not have to think about
this one it's the Maybelline fit me
concealer I actually the day that I'm
filming this video you can tell I am
about out of this concealer I was at my
CVS and I picked it up another one
because I love this concealer I cannot
have it not in my collection so I picked
up another one I use the shade 10 light
because I really like how it highlights
the under eyes but it is a fantastic
concealer obviously I love it
so a face powder that I absolutely love
and I have loved for years is from pur
cosmetics and it is their foreign one
press mineral makeup so this is what the
packaging looks like and seriously so
this is the inside you do get a mirror
and then obviously I love it and I have
another one I mean I love this powder
and I have been using it for so many
years I'm pretty sure that I discovered
this in college I picked it up from Ulta
I really have no idea why I don't know
if I saw it recommend it somewhere maybe
it was on sale or something I truly have
no idea but it was back in the day in
college and I'm far removed from college
that I started buying this and I have
gone through so many sins and I just
have to have this in my collection is
one of my favorite face powders I use it
to set my makeup I use it just days that
I don't want to wear foundation on my
face but I want just a little something
I will use this powder I actually have
the shade tan it's just my favorite
shade it might be a little bit darker
for some people but I usually like to
hide the paleness so I always buy the
shade tan and I think it works out just
fine for me so the pure foreign one my
ride-or-die
so Jacqueline also wanted to know our
favorite under eye setting powder and
that again did not take me along at all
this is the one that I use the most
often I think I featured it in my
YouTube made me buy it video because so
many people use this powder but
seriously it is the Rimmel stay matte
powder this is like two dollars or
something sorry I have like eyelash
adhesive on it don't mind me I'm a very
messy person and thought this because so
many people would talk about it on
YouTube and I was like clearly I need to
buy it it's super super inexpensive you
can get it at the drugstore and it is
like I mean I have been using it for so
long and I feel like there's no dent
like how is this am I ever gonna run out
of this stuff I have no idea like I've
tried everything else and I tried the
baking method with the loose powder and
all that and I like some of those just
fine but this is my ride-or-die so I
really did not have to think hard about
what blush was my favorite and it is
Luminoso from Milani love this blush
again this is one that everybody talked
about on YouTube and I was like do I
need to get it and I was maybe like six
months into making YouTube videos before
I finally went out and bought it so I
was tired of everyone raving about it I
didn't have it I am so so glad I bought
it this is beautiful Milani you can get
at the drugstores as well so it is a
little bit more affordable but it's such
a beautiful like bronzy shimmer peachy
type of blush I mean I wear it in every
single season no matter what season were
in and a way to make this work with my
makeup look and it is just such a huge
favorite of mine the bronzer that is my
absolute favorite is from Too Faced and
it is the chocolate Soleil bronzer to
face has amazing bronzers they have a
huge selection of different bronzers
something for everybody whatever it is
that you're looking for Too Faced is
probably gonna have that bronzer and my
bronzer is in this little sample guy and
I feel like every single time I use this
bronzer or I talk about this bronzer in
a video I'm like I don't know when I'm
ever gonna go through this sample and
I'm pretty sure it was free you know
like everyone's not Ulta will have you
know spend $50 at Too Faced and you get
a deluxe bronzer sample I've had this
for so long and I've not even hit paint
on the staple yet and like house is even
possible it's been never-ending bronzer
but I'm so not mad because I know
whenever the day comes that I in trun
out of this or it's just expired and
needs to be thrown away I'm gonna need
to get another one because it's such a
beautiful bronzer and it smells like
cocoa and never met at that so my
favorite highlight is I'm gonna have to
give it to the creator of this tag
Jaclyn hill because it is a champagne
pop from Becca cosmetics in
collaboration with Jaclyn hill I do have
the full-size here and then I also do
have the champagne glow face palette
which has champagne pop inside as well I
can't open this one really because
unfortunately it is shattered
which is very sad but once I bought this
highlight it became my favorite I
remember like two days after I got it I
was so obsessed with it me and my
girlfriends were going to get our nails
done like we were all bridesmaids in a
wedding we were getting our nails
stamped a couple of days before the
wedding and I can remember being in the
car and like putting the champagne pop
on more and I even says like you guys
know when you get a new highlighter you
just love it so much my friends were
like no no we don't get it it's not like
okay I'll just be back here like
applying highlighter like a fool and it
was champagne pop and I was just I was
so in love with it I was so happy with
it is it such a stunning stunning
highlighter it's one that I recommend
all the time and it's just my
ride-or-die so a for mascara I kind of
went back and forth between two but like
if I run out of both of these mascaras
at the exact same time which one am I
gonna go purchase first and it is the
lash sensational from Maybelline I love
this mascara you guys I talk about it
all the time I've talked about in like
drugstore favorites back-to-school
favorites favorites videos I just
something about this mascara just speaks
to me I love the way it makes my lashes
look and I'm not a huge mascara person
because I typically will wear false
lashes but they said I don't wanna wear
falsies will wear the Maybelline lash
sensational and I just think it does
amazing things for the lashes I
definitely always want to have this in
my makeup collection when it comes to
lipstick my absolute favorites are from
Maybelline I love their lipsticks and
basically like any formula of like their
regular lipsticks but there would be the
glossy or the matte I enjoy them all my
favorites are truffle tease which
actually is what I'm wearing right now
it's one of the glossy formulas and then
clay crush is kind of like the same
thing it's a very nude but just with a
little bit of a new to it and it is in
matte these two are my absolute favorite
but if I had to pick like a favorite
lipstick formula hands-down it would be
Maybelline Oh liquid lip was a little
bit harder for me to choose and I will
say I'm not gonna go pick a lip gloss
because I don't really wear a lot of lip
glosses and I have a few in my
collection now like from Kylie cosmetics
and from NYX Cosmetics but I don't have
a writer diet lip gloss so I have two
different like liquid lips to talk about
so hopefully that's okay
removing the gloss but one of them is
bow and arrow from Kat Von D and I feel
like so many people are gonna talk about
like Lolita from Kat Von D and that's
what Jacqueline talks about in her video
I don't have Lolita but I have bow and
arrow and I absolutely love it it is
such a beautiful like brown nude I've
been wearing it so much lately like I'm
getting a little bit tired of putting my
photos on Instagram and being like and
I'm wearing bow and arrow by Kat Von D
like wear something else Samantha but I
love it though this has just been my
writer daya for so long now and when I
run out of this I have to get it again
it's just my favorite but another liquid
lip that I want to give a shout out to
is the ultra satin liquid lipsticks from
colour-pop below of the ultra maps from
colour-pop and i used to love them so
much but as I've been trying more like
what lipsticks I've kind of a not loving
on the color pop ones as much it just
feel like it's a little bit too drying
on my lips but I recently tried out the
ultra statins and these two right here
are Alyssa and November from the
kathleenlights collab not only are these
colors absolutely amazing but I love the
ultra satin formula like I'm going to be
hooked on that definitely will be buying
more but it is such a beautiful like
everyday like nude pink type of color
and then November is such a pretty
pretty deeper pink shade I absolutely
love the both of these and have been
wearing them so much with the ultra
satin formula if you haven't checked it
out yet check it out so for lashes I
don't feel like this is a big shock
either but my favorite lash is that I'm
always stocking up on wispy lashes from
ardell I'm wearing them right now I have
several other open packages in my last
drawer and then I have two uh nope and
ones right here and I'm sure I have more
I just love the whispies so much they
look so pretty on the eyes Ardell it can
be a little bit confusing because like
these are both whispies but if you can
see like one says glamour and one just
says whispies but this one does say
whispies up here like their line can be
a little bit confusing to me but
basically anything from ardell that says
whispies on it I'm like yes I'm going to
buy that I love them so much I think
there are so so flattering on the eyes
and they're just like my go-to when I
don't know what lashes to wear 90%
chance I'm picking out the wispies so
Jacqueline also wanted to know our
favorite eyeshadow palette and I almost
didn't do this palette because I'm like
so many people are probably gonna do it
but okay it's for a good reason
it is the 3/5 Oh from morphe this
palette is so amazing and I feel like
I'm one of the last people that bought
this palette because it was so so hard
to get my hands on but I finally was
able to get it and I realized why so
many people love it it was shortly after
I got it I could not stop using it for
so many different types of looks I was
reaching for this palette and having to
remind myself like you need to use
something else
everybody keeps seeing the 35o but it's
so beautiful and honestly was between
this and the 35 t from morphe because I
love the 35 t honestly I want so many
more of the morphe palettes because
especially the 35 ones you have 35
different shades there's just going to
be so many different combinations you
can do like if you're going away on a
trip and you can only have room for one
palette
one of the more few ones is probably
going to do the right things for you but
I picked this one just because it has
more of a variety I think there's a ton
a ton of great Browns in here but
there's beautiful shimmery shades in
here as well and the Pops of oranges are
great and just like these deeper colors
down here they're just this is such a
well well-made palette and it is so
loved and it's been so hyped about but
for a very very good reason if you don't
have a 3/5 elliott from morphe you
should really get it so two other
categories that Jaclyn mentioned were
setting sprays and then also perfume I
barely wear perfume I have like some
nicer ones that I try to remember like
when I have a special occasion but I'm
really really bad at remembering to put
perfume on I also work from home and
don't go anywhere so I just don't really
wear perfume a lot and then something
sprays again like half the time I forget
to spray my face after I'm done using my
makeup I'm terrible at it I don't know
why my sprays are right on my top drawer
but I always forget them so I don't feel
like I have a writer dye in either of
those categories so I didn't really want
to mention them but one thing that she
didn't mention it was eyeliner and if
you guys know me you know that I'm an
eyeliner junkie so I have three
different eyeliners to talk about I know
but it's the last one I skipped several
of the categories that Jacqueline
mentioned so given myself past for this
one but ones that I want to talk about
are the eyeliners from colour-pop I
freaking love colourpop's
eyeliners the ones in the pencil form
don't go for the ones in the platform
you need to go for the ones in the
pencil form they're only five dollars
they have a huge array of colors I got
the mr. Bing from the kathleenlights
collection a while back when I bought
her lipsticks as well it is a beautiful
rich like warm brown color it's amazing
I have on my waterline right now it is
so beautiful I have like cry baby and
maybe cry maybe and maybe that's not
funny but they are a green and a purple
and I wear them all the time on my upper
lash line I think they are so beautiful
get paid is a gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
metallic but these liners stay so long
whether they're on your upper lash line
or whether they're even in your
waterline they do not budge they are so
amazing I more people need to talk about
these eyeliners I think they're
fantastic eyeliner that I need to
mention is from Maybelline it's their
master precise liner this is what I use
for my liquid liner so I will not use
the color pump ones to like make a wing
or anything like that one of the
favorite ones that I use is the
Maybelline master precise this is such a
good liquid liner and it has such a
precise tip to it it is super super
black it's amazing it's affordable it's
from the drugstore I will repurchase
this when I run out of it because I've
just found it to be a favorite and then
the last eyeliner I want to mention I
feel like you guys will probably know
what this one is too but it is the
wicked gel eyeliner from Sigma this is
what I have on right now I talked about
this eyeliner so much I'm constantly
recommending it to people a gel if you
are looking for a good gel eyeliner
definitely check out the wicket liner
from Sigma it is amazing I definitely
suggest pairing it with the eo6 brush
again from Sigma it's a very very small
precise winged liner brush and it's
again the combo that I used on my eyes
today it's amazing
this stays on so well I actually think
the Maybelline one is blacker than the
Sigma one but for a gel liner
such a favorite everything for my
ride-or-die makeup tag I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
seeing my favorites favorites favorites
in each of the makeup categories I would
love to know if we have any in common so
if we do please do leave that in the
comments below I would love to know that
I hope you guys did enjoy this tag video
I'm definitely tagging you guys to do

makeup tag I know last year she did the
fall favorites makeup tag as well and I
