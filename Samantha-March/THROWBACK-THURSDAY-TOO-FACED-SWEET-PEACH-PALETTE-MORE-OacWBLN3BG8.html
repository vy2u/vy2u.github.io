today's video is going to be a throwback
Thursday a style video I'm going to be
getting a ready on camera here using a
bunch of older products in my makeup
collection so if people are ready for a
CBT get ready with me style video why
don't we go ahead and get started
alright so I am gonna start with my eyes
I do have them a primed and I'm going to
use the Too Faced sweet peach palette I
did do a poll on Twitter and asked I had
three different options in there and as
of the time I sat down to film it was
really close between this one and the
anastacio Modern Renaissance but
everybody on my snapchat who wrote in
voted for the sweet peach so that is how
I decided which palette we're gonna use
today and I'm really excited because I
have not used this palette in a while
and it was like my go-to
I was picking up this palette every
single day for a while so that is what
we are going to be using today so like I
said I primer on it so I'm just gonna
grab peaches and cream and I'm gonna
place that all over my eye using a Mota
buffer brush I think that's what it's
called no Mota super crease brush is
what it's called so I was seeing a bunch
of people suggested doing videos like
this I did a lot of like flashback
Friday style videos but it's more
chatting about like old favorites
revisiting old favorites and do I still
love those products and more chaddy
style videos versus like a get writing
with me or a tutorial type of thing and
then I'm gonna pick up a puree and use
it my Sigma e-40 and put this one in it
to my crease but I've been talking about
it I've mentioned it in a few videos now
and then also in some other social media
platforms but my husband did this job
about two weeks ago now I think it was
so it's been really awesome to see my
comments section like filled with so
many ideas of different videos to do you
know kind of pertaining to wind we don't
really know what's going on with our
future I can't really be buying a ton of
things you know especially makeup right
now and things like that so so many
people were so kind and you know not
only writing in like positive and
encouraging messages which is done
absolutely amazing and like awesome for
you know our spirits but also there was
a lot of video suggestions in there and
a lot of people suggested doing more
tutorials like honestly
was I feel like that was the most
commented comment was doing more
tutorials and especially featuring items
that you know are more of like the
throwback style that you don't really
see being used a lot because you know
everybody's trying to put out tutorials
with the new things and the new releases
and all of that so I thought that I
could do a throwback Thursday tutorial
I'm gonna be doing like most of my face
like I have foundation and concealer
bronzer blush and highlight and then I
think in a shadow palette and then I
love color so I mean the majority of my
face I will be doing here and using some
of the older products in my collection
but thank you to everybody who wrote in
with suggestions and you know just any
sort of comment we appreciate it so much
and you know we read all of them and all
of that so that's been really cool but
if you have any other ideas or anything
like that you know feel free to let me
know if there's any other makeup
products in particular that you'd want
to see in a tutorial or other palettes
or things like that you know feel free
to leave those in the comments I did
like this idea too I love when people do
throwback videos i watch like that girl
Shae she does a lot of throwback
Thursday tutorials and I just think
they're so fun to watch and it's fun to
reach back in your collection and
revisit some of my items that you know
you love so much and used to use so much
so trying to do a few more of these so
I've just been really in it to pinks
lately so I think I'm gonna pick up the
shade caramelized right here and a sigma
e25 and I'm just gonna blend this into
the crease as well I've just been I
don't know I think it's just like my jam
as of lately so I'm just gonna kind of
tap it out here but I don't know with
these style videos like I don't really
do tutorials a lot I never really feel
like I'm actually doing a tutorial like
I'm completely a self-taught with makeup
through YouTube which is awesome I think
I still really do consider myself like a
newbie again when it comes to makeup I
don't know I feel uncomfortable being
like I am showing you a tutorial today I
just don't feel like I'm a there yet so
that's why I like to call these like get
ready with me they're things like that
so especially when doing an eye look I
might just kind of be showing you the
shades of doing it obvious
I'm showing it on here but if I feel
like I have a good tip you know I'll
throw it at you but I don't know I don't
feel like I'm really to that level yet
I'm gonna come in with a shimmer shade
so I'm gonna use the cream color this is
the e 58 from Sigma I'm just gonna spray
my brush with some fix+ that's what I
normally do with shimmers and then turn
to the side I think I'm gonna come up
here with lucious I really enjoyed this
shade oh my gosh it's been so long since
I pulled out this palette but I owe ya
yeah that's pretty alright was that one
who didn't get sweet peach like during
the first lunch do some of it went my
mouth I forget that it it has a taste to
it that's weird but I was one I missed
it in the first launch and so when it
came to my alte store I was actually at
all taught like 950 waiting for the
stores to open so I could get this
palette because it was so hyped about
didn't anybody else do that with the
sweet peach palette because that was
totally me and I remember thinking like
I don't know why I always have this in
my head like I'm the only one that's
interested in this palette like
obviously I'm not because it was selling
out online and all of these crazy things
but I was like surely I'm gonna be the
only one know there was like ten of us
when they opened the altar doors 10 me
10 other girls were running up the
stairs like wow what if there's only
five pallets oh my gosh that was kinda
crazy and I remember I grabbed two one
for me and then I was gonna put one in a
giveaway because I'd been you know it
was so hard to get I was like I'll get
one for like giveaway and I was walking
around with two and its sales associated
came up to me and she's like um it's
only one per person I was like I love
this crazy man I have a luscious place
down I'm just gonna come back in with
the e25 and just make sure everything is
blended come on put my eyes on hold for
a little bit and move it to my face like
I normally do so I did put some primer
on and then for my foundation I'm going
to use the Clinique beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer so I think like
one of my first
high-end foundations but I really do
enjoy it I'm in the shade at six point
five buttermilk though the applicator is
a Wanda like this so I'm just gonna go
ahead and apply this to my face my poor
skin as of lately is just pinna it's not
been doing well I don't deal with
breakouts a ton except for like once a
month and then if I'm a really stress
which obviously I have been under a lot
of stress absolutely so likely like my
poor skin is just it doesn't know what
to do I don't know what to do so this is
a nice full coverage foundation and that
is what that is what we need today and
then I'm gonna take my Sigma 3d HD
blender to blend it out these are
finally back in stock so I was excited
to use it I'm gonna use the side of it
these went out of stock for ever and I
finally I went to double check they are
again available on the single website I
think it's like $15 for the sponge and I
really really do like the sponge so I
was like never using it because I felt
bad because it was always out of stock
and derivatives like what are the Sigma
sponges coming back I'm like I don't
know has all these different like points
and edges to it so I don't know I just
feel like I can get all of like all
parts of my makeup done without like
using a dirty side with the sponge if
that makes any sense I don't know but I
just like sight it one eye so then it
was back in stock though so I don't
think that's this is not really
considered like a throwback but just my
makeup products are not necessarily like
my freshness or anything but I also
thought it would be fun to do more than
just more than just a palette because
there's so many products like
foundations and concealers and things
like that that are in my collection that
you know I passed over so much because
I'm like oh I'm testing that out or I'm
reviewing that or you know this is my
favorite right now tip of things so
thought it would be fun to incorporate
you know a little bit a little bit more
product into the video and you know of
course if I did a pallet only it would
be a shorter video and like who am i I'd
like whenever I put out shorter videos
I'm like I was weird right
Oh weird less than 15 minutes that's
weird
I must been talking fast I'm gonna take
one of my true Oh G concealers at the
Maybelline instant age rewind I think
mine is in the shade fair so I'm gonna
go ahead and apply this to my under eyes
I have gone through so many of these
Maybelline concealers it's crazy I feel
like this is like my very first ever
concealer that I ever got and it's still
it's just it's still freaking of just
fantastic concealer that's really all
there is to it so the shade fair is
pretty pretty light but I like it to
kind of brighten up the under eyes as
well so I'm just taking the same Sigma
sponge and blending that out okay I did
put some setting powder on my under eyes
as well I didn't really have much of
anything that I thought was like a
throwback but I'm gonna come in with my
physicians that formula butterbur out
there to bronze this bronzer is in my 18
and 28 seen my year long a project pan
video and it's so funny I'll have that
one ELISA town below in case you haven't
seen it but everybody is like there's no
way like there's no way that you're
hitting pain on that bronzer like
everyone says this is the hardest
brother to hit pan on how like oh boy
but I'm trying not to be like to stress
about my project pan because like
Michael was my project pan was more like
out of curiosity like I want to see if I
use something on a you know a pretty
dedicated consistent basis like how long
does it actually take me to use up
because when I did my skincare project
pan that I did with my friend Lisa I
noticed that I had this mindset of oh so
many of these products are almost gone
like it's just gonna take me you know a
couple more uses and I'm going to use
them up and it actually took the entire
like two-month project to use up some of
these products so I was like okay
definitely more in there than I thought
so I don't know that's kind of like why
I did the project pan I just kind of
want to know and like almost like be a
little bit more just informed or aware
of like how long it actually takes to go
through makeup so I'm trying not to put
too much stress on me like oh you
to finish all these 18 products in a
year I kind of just want it to be like
what can i what can I learn like what
will I be taking away from this project
pan but yeah this physician formula
browsers in there and so many people are
like that is such a hard project to pay
on and then also the highlight that I'm
going to use today is the one from that
project pan video and it's the mary-lou
manizer and that's another one that
people are like that took me forever to
hit pan on I'm like oh oh boy
we'll see how see how my check-ins got
think I'm gonna do a check-in every
quarter is what I decided on so we'll
see so for my blush I of course want to
pull out my Milani Luminoso I don't feel
like that's a little surprising a TBT a
choice yeah well it's just so cute I
thought maybe since we're going for like
something a little bit more peachy this
is like a really nice peachy blush with
a bit of shimmer in it I'm going to take
my morphe t4 and just apply that to the
cheekbones such a good blush I mentioned
this one in my YouTube first text that I
did with Jessica Braun that this was one
of my like original YouTube made me buy
it
products I can't remember like my first
first one but I was like I know but it
wouldn't actually have been no I just
thought of something so it wouldn't
actually with my Milani Luminoso because
I can't find it it was Milani Dulce pink
I think it was wrote what it was called
because I heard everybody raving about
the Milani blushes in general though
everybody loved to Luminoso so I
remember it took me forever to figure
out where Milani was sold around here
and we used to have a Kmart which it's
now shut down but I finally found Milani
up this Kmart but they didn't have any
of Luminoso so I bought Dulce pink and
then eventually where'd I get this one
from I must have ordered it online
because it was so hard to find Milani
around here you know a few years back so
but yeah that was what I was going for
it was luminoso but I actually know that
Bank don't say pink first and then I
just declutter that one when I did my
most recent blushed a clutter but I had
to keep living oh so because so pretty
okay so I don't have a like throwback
brow product at all so I'm going to do
my brows off camera because it takes me
forever my camera's blinking at my dad's
gonna over
but I'll be back in a second alrighty so
bras are on and I also added some nude
liner to my waterline and then I did put
on some mascara I was trying to decide
if I was gonna do lashes but I had like
a almost like an eye infection just a
couple days ago my eyes were pretty
swollen so I don't know I think that I
mean they're butter today they look
better and they feel they feel the best
that they have since I woke up with my
eyes super puffy which was on Saturday I
think it was but I'm gonna go ahead and
still not do top liner or lashes just
just for just for one more day just for
one more - I haven't worn lashes in a
while but I'm gonna give them one more
day of rest from liner and lashes just
to make sure they're totally okay so I'm
just gonna go ahead and leave the
mascara for right now but I'm gonna come
back into the palette and I'm first
going to pick up a puree right here with
this is a morphe Emma
5:07 and I'm just going to sweep this
along the lower lash line I'm not sure I
was talking about on my snapchat I was
like I'm not sure if I'm having a like
reaction to something or some people
wrote in and said you know maybe it's
like allergies or dry eye or things like
that so I'm not really a hundred percent
I do have pretty sensitive eyes so it
wouldn't shock me if it with some sort
of reaction or something um but I don't
know I mean they're doing better I
didn't do anything for him I didn't even
do eyedrops or anything they just kind
of cleared up on their own but just just
to be on the safe side I don't give it
another another day before I start
really going to town on my eyes and then
I'm going to use this new brush and just
pick up caramel or candied peach why I
was like I was calling it caramelized
earlier wasn't I know it's candied peach
I feel like I said it wrong at least at
one point candied peach the pink one so
I'm gonna go ahead and run that on the
lower lash line as well sometimes I'm
ascared to use too much pink but then
sometimes I just really like the way it
looks like sometimes it can make you
look kind of sick which you know I just
had an eye infection so maybe pink
wasn't the best choice but I've been
really loving pink eyes and pink lips
lately and I think as long as you mix it
with a brown I think that it looks okay
so that's what I'm gonna do and I know
sometimes like I feel sometimes like
strange doing like get ready with me
yourself because I feel like my eye
looks are typically really simple like I
don't have these crazy technique so that
other people do like it the eye look
that I showed you today is my absolute
go to a crease color a deeper crease
color a shim around the lid like that's
like my go-to so sometimes I feel really
uncomfortable doing videos like those
because I'm like what am I actually
bringing to the table here like you know
it's one of those but it was just really
interesting to see how many people said
do more tutorials and you know the
throwback style videos and things like
that so I'm like okay that's what I'll
do but I just I don't know I don't know
or if anybody wants like you know I
can't chat about certain topics if
there's ever like a topic that you would
want me to talk about to turn I'll get
ready with my style video you know leave
me any ideas down below or you know
maybe I can do like a QA or something at
one point like I'll be doing a get ready
with me but it can't be answering
questions for my Twitter or a snapchat
at the same time I don't know guys like
that idea
um but yeah thanks for all the comments
and suggestions because it really is so
so appreciate it right now it's just
such a weird weird time and also if I'm
talking quietly during this video it's
cuz much is actually here but he is sick
so he's right above me sleeping I'm sure
he's probably asleep because he had to
take medicine and then went to sleep but
I feel like I'm being like loud he has a
infection in his glands so like right
here it was like super swollen he woke
up Sunday with it and I'm filming on
Monday and I was like you need to go to
the doctor ASAP like barely talk or
swallow or anything so he went to the
doctor then I went to the pharmacy and
now he's upstairs sleeping but I was
like I still got a film
I'm just sometimes I feel like when I
home by myself it's been like yelling at
the camera I don't know why I talk so
loud um so if you're if you notice I'm a
little bit quieter it's I feel really
bad for him he is really sick and a lot
of pain which is awful and then I'm
gonna pick up a nectar here I'm going to
use my morphe thirty-six and I'm gonna
put this on the inner corner of my eyes
I'm really hoping I don't get it I
looked it up and it said it's not
typically
not contagious but I'm really hoping so
because we also are losing our health
insurance and we don't have our new
health insurance set up yet I'm like
please do not get sick like please do
not get sick until we have that all
squared away so it's just all kinds of
stressful I just I really can't I really
can't say how much I appreciate just all
of the messages the kind words we've
gotten like cards and letters to my PA
box and care packages and donations I
mean it's truly to spend it so
overwhelming to feel such a sense of
community I'm not gonna get upset
because I'm doing my makeup here but um
but it's been it's just been so so
interesting and you know Mitch obviously
like he knows what I do and you know
hears me talk about things but during
this whole process like so many people
have reached out to you know with like
certain job leads or like recruiters
have reached out you know I'm saying you
know have them email me his information
and I can try to help and you know
people have helped us out with insurance
stuff because I've been super
overwhelmed with that and it and it's
just it's just been so so crazy and I
felt like he's really been able to kind
of see that and experience it as well
and it just reminds you of like how good
the Internet can be at the same time in
social media because like there's a lot
of crappy parts to it of course and you
know things like that but then when you
see something like this happen and you
see how many people like step in and try
to help and just just want to take the
time just to message you to say like you
know hey sorry I'm thinking of you and
sending you positive quotes and things
like that like just for people who take
the time to do something like that it's
just it's been it's been um it's been a
little overwhelming where I'm going to
leave the eyes add some kind of peachy
pink it type of I look today and then
for my highlight to finish off my face
I'm going to
is mary-lou manizer from the balm this
is a Belgium tools tapered a contour
brush that I like to use as highlight so
I'm just gonna apply some to my
cheekbones like every time I use this
highlight I'm like me and she was my OG
this is my first highlighter I think I
mentioned this in my YouTube of first
video as well it's just me saying um
this was my first highlighter that I
bought because everybody was raving
about it I know I've mentioned that
before you know video I can't think of
which one it was but I know I've
mentioned it before and so many people
wrote in and said mary-lou manizer was
your first highlight as well sorry funny
how many people pick this one up I'm
gonna put just a little bit on I did
just like a bit of the bridge of my nose
and then the tip of my nose we're also
saying in my project pan since I put
this one in there they're like this is
so hard to hit pan on I'm like maybe
blue I don't know if we're gonna I feel
like there's it's crazy I feel like
there's no dent in it and I've had it
forever and like I said this was my
first highlight so this is what I was
wearing like every single day for the
longest time I thought my highlight
collection exploded out of nowhere I
still know how that happened
so I'm like how I'm very light handed
with my makeup felt like I'm very light
handed I did they use interviews makeup
tag and I was like no one's gonna
believe me because I'm so light handed
with my makeup but seriously still I
can't it looks like it's like brand-new
it's great and finally afford my lip
color I really wanted to pull out a NYX
soft matte lip cream these are used to
be like my absolute go to I wore them
all of the time and now I just barely
ever wear them but I'm like why I love
them so much and there's so many
different colors and I just love these I
pulled out London because this was like
I think this was like my true OG this is
definitely not my first one of London
I've got there's several of them it was
just one of my favorite nudes first so
long oh this one's almost empty to day
that's crazy
they are you so comfortable and so
freakin affordable I need to be wearing
these more for sure and I'm just gonna
spray my face I'm going to use my
Scandinavia setting spray um this is
the makeup a finishing spray I think
this was like one of my very first
setting sprays ever I've had it for a
very long time it's less than half full
actually so I shouldn't use this one
more so I can finish it off I'm telling
you some starting project pants it's
totally changed me I used to be that
person who when I was getting low on
something I would stop because for some
reason not like I didn't want to run out
and now since I started doing project
pants I'm like then you should finish
finish initially I get so excited about
it so but yeah this one is it's getting
down there so I'm just gonna go ahead
and spray my face okay so this is the
final look of for my throwback Thursday
tutorial using the two phases sweet
peach palette and some of the other
older and the loved on items from my
makeup collection I hope that you guys
enjoyed this one I know I did more of a
simple eye look and no lashes have so of
maybe for my next throwback tutorial let
me know what you want to see what you
want to see me do lashes would you want
to see something more colorful I feel
like I've been getting some requests for
purples in my collection so maybe I
could do something like that but again

especially for video ideas are so
helpful to me right now and I really do
appreciate it so much but I hope that
