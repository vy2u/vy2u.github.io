thanks for stopping by today today's
video I'm rural another tag video this
is the TMI tag too much information tag
I feel like this tag was really popular
like a year ago I saw a lot of the
bigger youtubers doing it Jacqueline
Hill did it eleventhgorgeous did it and
I don't know I don't know if it's as
popular as it is now but I thought it
was a pretty fun tag to do and thought
it would be interesting to do I just did
the booktube about me tag not too long
ago but this one is very like it gets
into pretty personal stuff which is
where the team I comes from so I thought
it would be kind of fun to do to get to
know me on another level I do apologize
for my voice I am suffering from a cold
I'm filming this four days before
Christmas and I have recently become ill
awesome but I hope you guys enjoy the
tag video I will be tithing some of you
to do this as well hopefully it's no one
who's done it yet since it was so
popular about a year ago but check the
description box I'll be taking some of
you and because this tag has 50
questions and we know I can be a little
bit long-winded let's just get started
out I'm wearing a shirt I don't know if
you guys will be able to see it but it
says not everything in Iowa is flat if I
can't get it in the frame up I can post
a picture both of it up here for you and
then I actually just still have jeans on
which is really surprising but I was out
running errands and I actually put jeans
on and then I for some reason I have not
changed into my yoga pants once I came
home and I feel like that's how you know
that I'm having a weird funky little day
when I don't get out of these jeans as
fast as I can
ah I have been I'm also married so I am
still currently in love I have I
probably had maybe like two that I'd
classified like bad breakups and both
were in high school so it's like now
that I'm still old and mature
and married I kind of look back and
think like that's kind of funny that I
thought they were like the worst
breakups of my whole life but yeah they
were pretty bad at the time I remember
them I am like just shy
of five six I don't know I don't I think
maybe we do own a scale maybe we do I
don't know obviously I don't weigh
myself if I don't remember if we even
have a scale but I don't typically weigh
myself but usually I'm anywhere between
like 110 and 120 if you have three
tattoos my first one is on my foot it
says somewhere along the lines of like
to travel I got it when I was 18 I love
traveling has a huge passion of mine
it's actually what I went to college for
so I want it to have some sort of like
symbol of that on me it's funny because
a lot of people said that I would
probably regret the tattoo and I think
it's just because I was getting it at
such young age and like it was something
I don't know I guess people thought it
was like a phase I was going through but
I've been interested in travel since I
was like seven years old I've wanted to
travel the world and I'm 28 now so I've
had the tattoo for ten years and I still
get excited when I look at it every
single day I think of all the places
I've gone to and the places I want to go
to so I'm still happy with it I also
have a pink ribbon behind my ear I don't
know if I'll be able to get it in frame
because I don't actually it's somewhere
back here I think it's somewhere back
there it's one that I cannot see myself
so but I got that for my grandmother she
passed away from breast cancer we had a
very close relationship so that one is
in memory of her and then I have this
one on my finger and it means to write
in Latin and it's because I am a
published author
I do have piercings I have my ears
pierced you know I think I gotten
pierced when I was a baby um I did have
I mean I still do have my ears double
pierced I very rarely wear double those
anymore but I used to have both ears
pierced all the way up and I had
cartilages the cartilage pierced in both
ears I did a lot of those piercings
myself in high school not a smart idea
because I always just had a lot of
problems with them like infections and
things like that
not my cartilage as though I did not
pierce those myself because that's just
a little too scary for me but like my
earlobes and stuff I would just like no
mum with an ice cube and stick a needle
but I stopped wearing all those earrings
I mean fairly quickly on in college
especially when I start working and was
trying to be professional and I had
eight holes in each year it was looking
kind of crazy but I did also have this
pierced at one point I don't know what
that's called
I really really liked that piercing but
again like my body was just like
rejecting it I didn't have my nose
pierced in college and that got infected
as well and when I took out the nose
ring I now have a like oh I have like a
blue-green scar on my nose excellent
I mean piercings we seem to really get
along but I also do have my bellybutton
pierced and that's about the only
piercing that has not given me any
issues I got that pierced when I was
very young and it's never had any
problems with it I said I wasn't totally
sure what OTP meant I looked very
briefly it meant like one true pairing
and I don't know what that means either
some people I think we're doing like
celebrity couples and like show couples
and things like that um I don't know if
I tend to really believe in like
celebrity matches they all tend to
fizzle out and show pairings I don't
really watch TV a lot so I don't really
know if it was any good like TV couple
I'm not really sure so that's a hard one
for me the answer
my favorite show I don't really watch TV
um favorite show oh I used to really
like the Gilmore Girls I used to watch
to get more girls with my mom all the
time and we loved it and I saw there's
like something about the Gilmore Girls
are they coming to Netflix or something
like that and everyone's really excited
about it I don't have Netflix because I
don't watch TV so why would I have
Netflix um but I think there's like a
lot of hype going on about the Gilmore
Girls and it's really taking me back I
love it my favorite bands um I really
like Slipknot they're also an Iowa band
and that's where I live I've seen them
in concert a couple times this past
summer I was most recently at Tinley
Park in Chicago
I like Avenged Sevenfold's Bullet For My
Valentine
I've seen them a couple times in concert
I think they're really good they're UK
band Killswitch Engage asking alexandria
aye aye
I really like all different kinds of
music I'd say like probably like rap and
hip-hop and pop is my favorite but I
also do really like rock and a little
bit heavier music and I've always kind
of liked them but then I met my husband
and he is very much into that kind of
music and I've just been exposed to it
more and it just I just really liked it
I enjoyed the concerts they're so much
fun sometimes certain concerts make me
feel a little scared and for some reason
those concerts will never make me feel
scared everyone is so those are probably
the nicest people I've met is at rock
concerts and I know people will not
believe me but I swear to you they are
so nice something I missed is my family
my family is military so they are
usually that not in Iowa where I am they
move around in a lot of the southern
countries and it's my sister she is
married to a man in the military and
they have four children and my mom moves
with them and moves around with them and
you know helps to be able to take care
of the kids and things like that and
yeah I missed them every day we don't
get to see each other a whole lot and
especially around the holiday time it
can be pretty sad because we don't get
to celebrate holidays together and it's
just so expensive to try to fly anywhere
on the holidays I've tried it I've done
it before and it's just so crazy
expensive so but yeah I miss them every
day I don't know I always have like a
million favorite songs at once but then
of course when you ask me my favorite
song I'm like but right now I've really
been liking save the money from a little
Dicky and Fetty WAP and also the weekend
I'm super into the weekend right now I
love like any of the songs that I hear
I'm into him I am 28 am in Aries and if
you follow me like in social media world
at all you'll see that we have a visual
puppy and her name is Aries my husband
is
though in Aries I definitely look for
someone who is supportive who's funny
can make me laugh who can kind of like
roll with the punches I feel like I'm
like kind of describing my partner
because I'm not currently looking for a
partner but those are the things that I
would look for in a partner
my favorite quote um one of my favorite
quotes that I have written down on like
my pencil holder next to my desk is stay
strong you never know who you are
inspiring and I really like that one
especially because I'm very like active
in social media it's like you never know
which one of your posts will like strike
a chord with someone else because it
happens to me like on a daily basis I
will see someone else in the social
media world like just either say
something or they post a positive quote
or they just they just post something
and it resonates with me and so that's
kind of something that I like to keep
myself reminded of on the daily I don't
know if I could say actor or actress but
I've always been a huge fan of Reese
Witherspoon I also really really like
Blake Lively for actors I'm not really
sure I don't really follow that a whole
lot and like a lot of people have like
crushes on celebrity actors I really
don't they don't they don't do anything
for me I'm much more of like an athlete
kind of girl my favorite color is pink I
like loud music I play a lot of music in
the car I play loud music when I'm like
getting ready to go out just loud music
I don't really have like a place that I
go to I probably would say my office
because then I can like get involved in
my work and my work is my passion it's
what I love to do and I enjoy doing it
so yeah I'd say I'd probably just get to
work and get over it
this one really makes me laugh
especially if you know me I I don't like
showering I I don't really like it at
all
how long does it take me to shower I
mean like in the shower it probably
takes me like 15 minutes but the reason
like one of the big reasons why don't
showering is because then when you get
out of the shower you have to put all
the stuff in your hair and you have to
put like your oils on and your lotions
on you have wait for your hair to dry
you put more stuff in your hair it's
just such a long process well I really
don't like have a lot of places that I
need to be in the mornings so that's
kind of hard I work from home um but
like I don't know I guess it depends
like if we're going out it can take me
like an hour and that's honestly it's
because I'm mostly like dancing to my
music or I multitask all the time so a
lot of times I'm reading a book while
I'm getting ready which makes the
process longer but if we're just doing
something like small and I'm doing
pretty basic make makeup maybe like 15
minutes 20 minutes yes my high school
got a little rough my senior year Oh
humor singing dancing love dancing
having a good conversation where I laugh
going back to humor good thing my
husband is funny um
negativity I'm not about that life I
joined as a way to try to connect with
more people that's kind of what I was
always like already doing in my career
because I am self-employed and
especially because I'm in like the book
marketing side of business you're always
looking for more ways to reach readers
and that sort of thing and I thought
YouTube would just be another platform
for me to do that and I also did it
because they wanted to really get
started on the beauty side of things
when I started chiclet plus in 2009 it
was always focused on beauty as well but
I didn't feel like the beauty post for
resonating as much with our audience and
it's because Beauty is so much more
visual then it is being written out like
people would rather see you review a
product and put it on than they would
read your review does that make sense so
that's those are two kind of like the
main reasons why I started and I'm so
happy I told my husband the other
I said I finally feel like I'm doing
everything that I want to do and because
I'm on YouTube that that was like the
final piece I clicked into place my
fears um I don't know I guess like my
big fears are like losing people that I
love I've I've lost people that I loved
whether it be like family members are
friends and that's a huge fear of mine
because I I love the people I have in my
life so much and it's like devastating
to think about losing them whether it be
like death of course but even something
like moving away or just a friendship
falling apart I lost my best friend two
years ago for I I don't know why she
kind of just stopped talking to me after
my wedding she was my maid of honor no
big deal and I've never figured out the
reason I have no idea what happened and
it's something that I think about
literally every single day and it just
kind of scares me you know you you bring
people in your life and you hold them so
close to you because you you love them
and so when they go away for whatever
that reason is like that's really sad so
that a fear oh gosh I cry all the time
you guys like I'm the most sensitive
person like I was choking up when I was
saying that I missed my families around
the holidays and I got I saw a video the
other day at the daycare that I take our
dog to Aries they're like one of their
daycare dogs passed away and they had a
video like montage of his life and I
bawled it's about the whole thing that
was probably the last time I think that
was just yesterday um that would have
been last night before we went to bed I
told my husband I loved him it's just my
my regular old name I I didn't want to
do anything like flashy or like creative
just because I really like wasn't sure
where this channel was going to take me
I honestly I knew I was starting in his
books and beauty but even now I'm like
one day I might be only books one day I
might be only beauty I might bring in
more things so I didn't want to like
pinpoint me into a specific area so
that's why I went with just my name last
book I read currently I'm reading the
view from Prince Street and this is by
Mary Ellen Taylor and it
is so good it's a lot of like it's
mostly in the present tense but we have
just a little bit from the past and like
historical fiction sprinkled in and I
really really enjoy it
the book I read before that was the big
lead and it was my Libby Kirsch and it
was a mystery novel and I absolutely
loved it couldn't put it down so hard to
put that book down really really good I
just answered that I clearly I didn't
look ahead of the questions the last
show I watched I watched Sunday Night
Football last night
the last person I talked to my husband I
can't look at my phone cuz my phone is
currently recording me but I'm nearly
positive the last person I text it was
this morning and it was my husband and
our relationship I I feel like it's
quite well we're married for just over
two years now my favorite food that's so
hard I like food I'm I love sweets I
love I love ice cream and I love candy
bars oh I could go for a candy bar right
now like a KitKat or a Twix all right
KitKat
okay I thought I would go for a KitKat
right now and some ice cream because my
throat is killing me because I'll feel
good but like regular food oh I love
chips too like Doritos Cheetos all day
other than that I really like pasta big
pasta girl oh I mean I have like a
massive list but like Italy really tops
my list of places I want to go I've
always wanted to go to Italy France
there's a big yes Hawaii I would love to
go to and even you know some more like
regular areas but like the Dominican
Republic Turks and Caicos I want to go
everywhere last place I was I don't I
don't know we went to visit family this
past weekend in Carroll Iowa where my
husband's from well I mean that's kind
of hard to answer because I am married I
don't know do you have a crush on your
husband I don't I don't really feel like
you have crushes on your spouses but I
mean I feel like I always have a
on Clay Matthews from the Green Bay
Packers is that acceptable this morning
when my husband left for work and he
gets me goodbye um I don't know I don't
know I don't feel like it's been
recently so I guess that's good
but I also like I take things very
personally and I take things very like
I'm very sensitive and actually an
author commented on a YouTube video
recently and I don't know I felt a
little insulted by it but I tried not to
because I think she was just trying to
like explain herself and like she was
kind of upset with something that maybe
I said in the video and I think she was
just trying to like explain her side of
the story but like those things I take
so personally that like I kind of felt a
little bit insulted by it but yeah other
than that nothing too recently which is
nice
oh sweet what of just like in general of
sweets I like chocolate that count I
don't play any instruments I think I
actually answered this in the booktube
about me tag and no I don't play
instruments I can't
I'm not mm-hmm um it'd probably be my
wedding ring I really enjoy my wedding
ring and my bands but other than that I
also do have this necklace I mean you're
totally not gonna be able to see it
because camera is so far away but it
just has like it has a silver and a gold
I'm not sure which one is silver and
which one is gold but just like little
plate on them and one says em and one
says s and it's for mentioned Samantha
for me and my husband and I just think
it's like so like dainty and feminine
and I like the mix of the gold and the
silver because I can really wear it with
whatever you know I don't have to worry
about wearing all gold or all silver and
I got it for my birthday last year I
think for my husband and I really loved
it
mm maybe like volleyball in the summer I
don't really play sports I don't really
play sports I could watch sports all day
but I don't really
I like to play volleyball like sometimes
we played I'm like little leagues or
things like that and those are fun I
currently have a song by The Weeknd in
my head and I keep like singing it out
loud at certain points but I don't
really know exactly what it's called
what are you sang it in the Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show oh what's it called
I don't want to sing it because
especially with how my voice is like
that's not gonna be pretty
I'll try to put it up here if I can find
it I mean I don't use pick-up lines
anymore and I don't even feel like
pick-up lines are all that popular
nowadays I just get like people are much
more like straight forward these days I
mean it's kind of weird it's probably
why I don't go out as much anymore I'm
kind of freaks me out
no I hung out with my in-laws over the
weekend we actually celebrated Christmas
a week early with some of the family and
then I also got to hang out with one of
my good friends Ashley we had breakfast
and we weren't shopping together add my
sister-in-law's boutique back in Carroll
got some new good stuff of course right
after I filmed the clothing haul then I
went back to top loft and bought more

be tagging a few specific people in the
description box below so be sure that

that video and got to know me a little
bit better on that really wasn't as bad

up right after the holidays before I get
back into my filming groove and I
actually worked out just because I'm so
sick I thought probably was one of the
better once and I could film instead of
like a makeup tutorial and I'm like
