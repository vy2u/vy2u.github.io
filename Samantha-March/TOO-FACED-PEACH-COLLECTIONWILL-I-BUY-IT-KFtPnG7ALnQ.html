today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I have kicked off my will i buy
it series which means i will have a new
will i buy a video every single
Wednesday have you're new here welcome
my name is Samantha I post videos nearly
daily I aim for every single day for
video but sometimes every other day but
I hope that you will click the subscribe
button it so you will get notified when
I post all of my videos including my
weekly series which is a will i buy it
Wednesday
or I talk about certain products
typically new releases or things that
are coming back and stock that sort of
thing and I just discussed if I will buy
it why I want to buy it why I want to
skip on it I talk about when it's being
released where it'll be able to be
purchased to the price I show pictures
of the products and that sort of thing I
started the will i buy it videos and
turned it into a series because it
seemed like a really fun way to still be
able to talk to you guys about new
releases even though I can't buy
everything I don't get a lot of PR
packages of that sort of thing so it's
still kind of my way to be able to talk
about a product and just discuss like as
a friend will I buy it will I not buy it
and then you guys leave in the comments
down below what you're thinking if
you're gonna buy what I'm talking about
if you've already bought it or if you're
gonna pass on it so today's video is
going to be a little bit different
because I'm going to be talking about
only one collection usually in my will I
buy eight videos I talk about like four
or five different products from
different brands but a lot of people
have been asking me about this
collection so I thought I could do a
dedicated video to the collection and
because I'm doing these every single
week now I kind of don't feel the
pressure to put as many different
products as I can into the video since I
know that I'll be filming a new one in
just a few days and we'll have another
video out there so I might do more on
these collections if you guys do want to
see these types of videos like based on
the collection where I can go more in
depth on each individual product and not
try to rush it so I can talk about other
products as well please leave that in
the comments below because there's a lot
of different collections that I could
talk about but in today's video we're
going to be discussing at the Too Faced
sweet peach collection and that launched
so I'll go over each of the products
that are in the launch when you can get
them where you can get over the price
and what the product is all about so why
don't we go ahead and jump right in so
tree base is going to be releasing a
peach collection so
last spring I believe it was they
released the sweet peach eyeshadow
palette and people lost their minds over
it
I lost my mind over it I showed up at my
Ulta 9:50 a.m. with my coffee waiting
for it to open so I could purchase the
sweet peach palette people went crazy
this sold out so fast it was flying off
shelves nobody could get enough of the
sweet peach palette Oh like I said I
have the palette here I can go into in
depth about my thoughts of the palette
and I think the pellet is worth it but
you know the owners of Too Faced I think
saw the response and decided okay not
only do we need to come back out with
the sweet peach palettes but you know
let's expand like let's do an entire
collection I mean I don't know what
their actual conversation sounded like
but to me that would be basically what
it is okay people lost their minds over
that let's bring it back let's bring
back more boom holler it's done so they
are coming out with the whole peach
collection I am filming this video of
the day after the peach collection party
launch happened with Too Faced and they
invited a lot of influencers out my
invitation must have just got lost like
where'd my invite go
so my invite got lost so I did not go to
the party in LA but also I'm waiting I
haven't seen any of the videos come out
yet I know those influencers were given
packages with the collection inside I
haven't seen any videos pop up yet but
I'm anxiously awaiting to see when those
videos or swatches etc will come out the
peach collection I can insert a picture
here of what the collection is going to
look like it does include the sweet
peach palette it also includes the sweet
peach glow kit highlighting the palate
the sweet peach creamy lip oil and the
Papa don't peach blush okay so the full
collection will be available on the Too
Faced website at December 14th at
midnight EST it will be online at uLTA
Beauty and Sephora December 15th and in
stores January 5th the sweet peach
palette will be available online at
Alton's for December 15th and in stores
at December 26 just so you know I am
getting in my information from the
Instagram page trend mood 1 this is the
great Instagram account to follow I can
leave it linked down below just she's
really really great at having it
Meishan about new releases so that's
where I'm reading it from she puts
everything right there I think it's
great I'm obsessed with her Instagram I
read from it all the time so I did want
to let you guys know that is where I'm
getting my information if there's any
questions I would say check out Redman 1
for Shore
okay so jump into it the sweet peach
palette is going to be $49 I have the
sweet peach palette and to be really
honest I freaking love it
I love it this is one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes I get asked a lot and
then when the peach palette was
announced that it was going to be coming
back I started to get a lot of questions
do you think this palette is worth it
should I get this palette I'm gonna go
ahead and say yes I think that you
should get this palette I love it I
think it's fantastic
it smells like peaches which is great
when you open it up you kind of get that
scent and it's nice it does come with a
mirror it is the hard tin the chip
palettes were just released from Too
Faced and I got the white chocolate chip
palette if you haven't seen any of my
videos I can leave them linked down
below and that was like very cheap
plastic packaging that wasn't very nice
this is like the tin packaging very nice
very cute packaging obviously lots of
peaches going on mirror inside very nice
the eyeshadow pans are nice and big I
love it the shades are beautiful when I
got this palette I was obsessed with it
I couldn't put it down
I still create a ton of eye looks I try
not to use it as much anymore on camera
when I'm doing tutorials because I know
a lot of people were frustrated that
they were not able to get the palette so
I try not to use it as much on camera
but days where I'm not filming or I'm
not filming a tutorial a lot of times
I'm reaching for this palette because I
love it there are some great like these
shades over here great transition shades
great shimmery shades which one is it
this nectar shade I constantly use as an
eyelid color peaches and cream I use all
the time it's such a good base color
like I mean that might seem like a
really boring color but you need a good
base color for your eyes and a brow bone
highlight peaches and cream is amazing
for that so is white peach this luscious
shade I use all the time it's a
shimmer color even something like
candied peach which is up this pink
shade right here that has a bit of a
sheen to it it might not seem like an
exciting color but it's gorgeous puree
and some are YUM I use as crease colors
all of the frickin time
bless her heart is this gorgeous screen
right here it's amazing it's beautiful I
love it I just I love it so much some of
these darker shades over here I don't
gravitate towards as much but literally
the rest of the palette I use up so I do
have some videos out with tutorials and
I think you meant swatches of this so I
will leave any of those linked down
below but if you do want to see another
tutorial using this just let me know but
for like will I buy it
obviously I own it so I'm not going to
buy it again but I didn't have it I
would buy it okay so the next one that I
want to talk about is the sweet peach
glow kit which is $42 so it comes with a
bronzer a highlight and then a blush
topper so I'll insert the picture down
here so that you can see it so what I've
seen about the highlight it looks really
pretty it has like the soft peach effect
to it obviously it's going to be kind of
a peachy highlight I think that one
looks really pretty the blush topper
again looks like a like peachy sheen
obviously I mean of course all of this
is going to be like somewhat peachy
right so that is the blush topper and
then the bronzer I believe is a shimmer
bronzer from what I've seen and heard
and like the pictures that I've seen it
does look to be like a shimmery bronzer
again this is $42 and it does have a
mirror in it it looks to be like really
similar to the Too Faced eyeshadow
palette except what's inside this
obviously different the highlight I
think that I would really like I do I
think that I would really like it the
blush topper I'm not so sure I've never
felt like I've really understood what a
blush topper is and what it's for and I
don't feel the urge to use it the
bronzer I feel like could be pretty but
because I'm hearing though it's a
shimmer bronzer that makes me not as
excited I don't really like my bronzer
to have a lot of shimmer to it I'm much
more of like the matte bronzer type of
girl so out of the three products that
are in this palette I think I would only
like one so do I want to spend $42 and
get the entire palette I do not
wish that the highlight would be
separate and honestly like because
highlights are you know it's such a
craze I'm kind of surprised they didn't
come out with an individual highlight
but for that reason I think I'm gonna
pass over this palette it just I don't
feel like I would use the bronzer at all
maybe I would use the blushed hopper a
little bit but probably not and so I'm
not gonna spend 42 dollars just to get
one highlight so the peachy glow I'm not
going to get but again that one is $42
let us know what you think of it in the
comments down below next one that we
have is Papa don't peach which is a
blush it is $30 I will leave that down
below so obviously this is going to be a
peachy blush am i right
so as I'm in the middle of filming this
video Madison Miller has put up her
video of the peach collection and going
through it so each time that I'm waiting
for my camera to cool down because it
overheats I am watching her video to see
what it's about so I'm kind of like this
is kind of crazy I've never really
filmed this way but I was just watching
what she had to say about the Papa don't
peach blush she said that the blushes
are different from what's in the
highlighting palette to the individual
blush that you know the Hyland palette
is supposed to be more of the blush
topper and it's more of like a peach
tone blush where the blush in the
individual palette is that is still a
peach blush but it's more on the cool
tongue side and then it definitely has a
sheen to it so I saw her swatch I can
leave her video link down below if you
guys would want to check it out like I
said I'm watching it as I'm also filming
this video so that was kind of nice that
that came out us I was doing this so the
blush is $30 which right away that is
kind of expensive for a blush like I
love colour-pop blushes a lot they are
eight dollars
I love Milani blushes and they're
drugstore and they're very affordable as
well like 6 or 7 $8 or something along
those lines so $30 is definitely
expensive the packaging is the same as
well where it's the tin just like the
eye shadow palette so even Madison said
you know probably a lot of the cost is
coming from that packaging so I get it
I'm not a huge blush person I'm really
not and I do own quite a few blushes
anyways and I have blush palette
sort of thing so do I want to spend $30
on one individual blush I don't think
that I do that just seems a little bit
too expensive for me for someone who
doesn't love blush like some people love
blush like that's what they are so
excited to put on when they're doing
their makeup look they can't wait to put
their blush on and I am not that kind of
person so it's mostly the price that's
getting me I get it and I like the
packaging I think it's super cute
from what I have just like quickly seen
of the swatch it looks really pretty and
it looks like a blush that I would like
to wear I love peach tones I love it
I've talked about it I think this in my
last fall I bought it that the color pop
came out with their peach line
collection lippies and I was so excited
for it because I love peach so I think
this blush would look flattering on a
lot of people and I think it will look
flattering on me I just don't want to
spend $30 on it that's just too much for
me and for what I need in my personal
collection but again we're all different
I'm not telling anybody not to buy this
blush because maybe you love blush maybe
you need a new blush for your collection
maybe you need the specific color in
your collection
so for me I'm gonna pass on it but what
do you guys think are you gonna get the
blush leave it in the comments down
below so last ones we're gonna talk
about are the sweet peach creamy lip oil
lip glosses have eight different shades
and they are $19 a piece so again what
my camera was cooling down I watched
Madison she's watched each one on her
hands and on her lips in her video and
these timbi seem interesting because
they are supposed to be a lip gloss but
they're also supposed to be like super
hydrating good for your lips that's kind
of where like the lip oil comes in but
then also have really good pigmentation
it supposed to smell like a peach that
sort of thing so $19 to me for a lip
gloss is pretty expensive
and honestly Beverly Hills and Kat Von D
look what lipsticks are $20 so I'm like
$19 for a lip gloss like that seems kind
of pricey so I'm not so sure that I'm in
love with that price would I buy all
eight shades no as I was watching
Madison swatch them on her lips I really
did like the one it was called peach
tease it was kind of like a darker coral
type of color they looked nice on her
lips but again like I'm just
a huge of lipgloss person she did say
that they weren't sticky but I don't I
don't know this one like when I saw him
I was like yeah I could get one and test
it out and try it out but honestly like
$19 for a lipgloss I'm like I don't know
if I want to do that this might have to
be one where I actually like go into
Sephora and Ulta and swatch them and see
what I actually feel about them before I
decide to get him because I'm just a
little nervous that I would get it and
then it would be sticky or just she did
mention that some of them are streaky
maybe because they're supposed to be
like the lip oil slush lip gloss so she
did point out several times like they
can go on streaky you just need to rub
your lips together but sometimes like
when I rub my lips together wearing lip
gloss it makes it more streaky instead
of less streaky so I'm like I don't know
like as I'm talking about it now again
new collection very very new collection
that's being released don't have a lot
to go off right now but just kind of
talking my way through it out loud the
more that I'm thinking about it when I
first saw it I was like yeah I'll get
one now that I like talking my way
through that I'm kind of like no I don't
think that I will so I think it's just
the price points out a lot of these and
here just seemed a little bit pricey to
me thirty dollars for a blush nineteen
dollars for a lip gloss it just seems a
little overpriced in my opinion but I
don't know I think I'm gonna pass on the
lip gloss as well maybe if I can get
into Sephora I honestly don't go to my
ball very often I don't prefer to go
into stores but maybe this will be
something that I actually have to swatch
in person or maybe if more swatches come
out I can see what I think but as of
right now I think I'm gonna say that I'm
actually gonna pass on that as well so
overall for the Too Faced week peach
collection I'm pretty much gonna pass on
everything besides the peach palette
that I do already own I own it and I
love it
so when I saw that they were coming out
with a collection I thought like oh my
I'm gonna have to get so many more
things because I think they all look
really good but I wish they would have
came out with a highlight separately
because I probably would have purchased
that but to put it in a palette with a
shimmer bronzer that I just don't use
shimmer bronzers and then
a blush topper that I probably wouldn't
use I just don't want to go for that at
$42 a blush being $30 I just think is a
little overpriced in my opinion in the
$19 lip glosses again I think are a
little pricey and if you haven't seen I
did purchase the Too Faced - white
chocolate chip palette I have first
impression reviews makeup tutorial I can
leave all of that link down below and I
might still be a little salty after that
palette so um that might be having a
factor in here too I was just like so
completely unimpressed with that palette
and from what I've seen I mean there
have been a few people that said you
know I really like the white chocolate
chip palette I really like the chocolate
chip palette you know they're working
for me I think they're great but the
majority of what I'm seeing as a lot of
people are disappointed and not just
because of the size that they were mini
palettes but because of the actual
shades and pigmentation and that sort of
thing that they just were not good so
yeah I might still be like hankering on
to some feelings from that one but just
in my opinion it just seemed a little
too overpriced for me for what each
thing was so I'm actually going to pass
on the Too Faced peach collection
palette honestly like when I first
started this video I didn't think that's
what I was going to say but looking more
in depth madison's video was really
helpful to be watching as I'm filming
this video as well and it just it's it's
