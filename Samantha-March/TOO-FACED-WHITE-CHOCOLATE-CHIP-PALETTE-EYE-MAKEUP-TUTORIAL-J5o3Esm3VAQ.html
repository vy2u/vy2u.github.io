today's video is going to be a first
impression makeup tutorial using the
white chocolate chip palette from Too
Faced so this is a new release from Too
Faced I just picked it up on Cyber
Monday I have done a first impression
slash swatch video on this palette that
should already be running I will leave
that link down below so to be honest you
can probably tell in the swatch video
that I was pretty underwhelmed by what
was happening with the swatches and it
made me pretty nervous because I was
very excited for this palette but
unfortunately when I was going through
and doing the swatches it just wasn't
impressing me too much the shimmers were
okay but the mattes were very like
underwhelming to me there was a handful
of like chalky and patchy shades so I
was a little bit worried so I figured
why don't we go ahead and do a tutorial
right away so I can actually try to put
these on my eyes and see what they look
like because I don't think it's fair to
do a video and just do swatches and say
like yes I think you should get it or no
I don't think you should get it we have
to actually do a tutorial and put them
to the test so that is what we are going
to do today so I'm just gonna do a quick
eye makeup look with this test out as
many of the shades that I can on my eyes
and see what we think of it but I have
my fingers crossed I hope this goes
better than the swatch video did because
yeah I was I was a little bit
underwhelmed by it but we're gonna try
we're gonna do a first impression I
makeup tutorial using the new two face
of white chocolate chip palette this is
a $26 palette and it has 11 different
shades inside this one is exclusive to
these Sephora websites it is not
available right now it will be coming
back I believe after the holidays
hopefully by that time I'll have given
you enough of videos and swatches and
tutorials and demos that you'll be able
to decide if this is one that you want
for yourself or not so I'm gonna go
ahead and hop into with the tutorial
okay so nice and zoomed in here I've no
other makeup on my face and I just woke
up so good morning and so I did just put
some concealer on my eyes to act as a
primer so I'm first gonna take this
white shade right here which is in glaze
and I'm just taking a flat brush from BH
Cosmetics and I'm just gonna use that to
set the concealer
as ready to go so this shade when i
swatched it was just very chalky and
like hardly showed up and again I mean
this is a step that I do it most of my
makeup looks and usually you can tell
even if you're using a white shade you
can tell a little bit more than this
that you're putting a shadow on so hmm
yeah that one just when i swatched it
was just so so super chalky so I don't
know man
so a lot of times with my like first
time you're using a palette I go for a
pretty simple love just something that
I'm comfortable with just so I can kind
of test it out I got something that I'd
wear on an everyday type of basis so I'm
gonna grab this shade right here which
is called ambrosia and I'm gonna pick up
my morphe m4 for one brush just a fake
like fluffy crease brush and place this
into the crease there is also a lot of
fallout with these shadows so gotta be
careful of that so I just feel I don't
know I feel like it's just putting like
a sheen down I don't know
this cut this is kind of a strange color
I mean I see I mean yeah there's there's
definitely something on my lid but I
don't know I feel like it looks kind of
strange like I I don't know that's just
I don't know that one's kind of weird
let's try another one let's try another
one I'm gonna pick up this like kind of
like cool toned gray shade I think it is
called guilt-free and this is my Sigma
e25 blending brush I'm gonna put some of
this right into like the outer V
and then slowly kind of work it in
towards the inner corner of the eye
this one when i swatched it i mean i had
to go in several times to try to get any
sort of like payoff to it and i think
it's gonna be the same as when you're
putting it on your eyes because like i
can see it starting to come up but i
just have to keep dipping back into the
palette in order for it to begin to show
i'm afraid for like how much you have to
go back into the eyeshadows and how it's
like teeny-tiny of these pans are there
like I feel like I'm just gonna like hit
pan at any moment um mmm
I think that's all I'm enough do for
that one for now let's try a shimmer
shade because like I said the shimmer
swatched much better than the masted so
let's try that so I'm gonna pick up the
shade right here I think this one is
indulged and my Sigma II 54 brush and
apply this to like the inner part of my
eyes
oh my can you guys see all that fall out
I knew that I didn't want to do my face
makeup first because of when i swatched
I knew that there was a lot of fallout
but me and I'm glad that I did that
because especially when you have like a
glittery shimmery shadow and then you
have a ton of fallout like around your
eyes can just look crazy sorry you're
like all up in me right now but do you
see all this glitter all this fallout no
it's pretty it doesn't have quite the
amount of umph I was hoping for its kind
of sheer and it's mostly like just
glittery
and then the fallout is just really
really quite intense
I grab my e25 again with no extra
product and just kind of do a quick
blend of these two okay so I'm gonna
finish my face do my face before I do
finish off the rest of my eyes and that
sort of thing um I yeah I don't know you
guys shoot um let me I'm gonna finish
off my face we'll come back we'll finish
off the eyes we'll do some maybe I'll do
some more shadows and do some shadows on
like my lower lashline and stuff but uh
these videos are not going the way that
I was hoping that they would go let me
finish my face and help you get right
back okay I'm back I just threw
something like foundation concealer
bronzer blush on and now I'm going to
finish off the eyes I've been like
staring at this I look in the mirror and
I'm just not very happy right now and
just the amount of glitter around my
eyes
I took a makeup wipe and was trying to
wipe it off and then I put my concealer
on but I still feel like there's a lot
of glitter around my eyes so um let's
keep trying so a real quick I'm just
going to put some of this Rimmel in the
nude liner on my waterline to kind of
help right and up in my eyes like I said
I just woke up and I'm sure I look very
tired I'm to grab this shade right here
which i think is what is this cake
batter and my morphe 36 brush I'm gonna
put this one on the lower lash line
so again if you just go in like four or
five times you'll start to get the color
but me and you really have to really
have to work with these and then I'm
gonna pick up the shade right next to it
which is called cookie dough
this one has some Sheen to it but I'm
gonna place that on the lower lash line
as well mostly just to see what it looks
like I feel like I have enough glitter
around my eyes as it is but just kind of
want to see what this one looks like
this one has a lot of like I don't even
know what to say like even though I'm
tapping it off like once I start to run
it around my eyes it's like shooting up
into my eyes a lot of these shades a lot
of these shades have serious fallout so
that's a little disappointing I thought
about doing like some sort of inner
corner highlight but honestly I have so
much glitter around my eyes that like I
don't I don't really want to do that
because I feel like I'm kind of looking
crazy so um let me put some mascara on
try to tie everything together okay so
I'm just gonna do some Too Faced better
than sex mascara on my upper and lower
lashes I'm not going to do a lot with
liner because when I'm testing out our
shadow palettes I kind of want to see
all the shadows sometimes you can use
liner to like cover things up you know
aren't you guys this is the finished eye
look so the shades that I used the first
shade I went in with which was glaze the
white shade it really didn't show up
same with when i swatched it and then I
went in with ambrosia as a crease color
again it really didn't show up and then
I went in with guilt free that one it
was a pretty shade but you really had to
go in multiple multiple times in order
to get any sort of the color payoff and
then the shimmer shade that I went in
was indulge it is pretty I mean it's a
the pretty shade but the amount of
fallout and glitter in it makes it
really hard to work with and makes me
pretty hesitant to use it again just
because now I have to go out and public
with glitter all around my eyes like
just the amount of fog fallout was so
crazy I mean it's a pretty color and I
like it
combined with the guilt free I like
those two shades together I think they
look pretty on the eyes once you can get
them there but it just takes a while so
and sorry I don't have my brows on or a
lip yawn but we're trying to focus this
on just the eyes so please just be
focusing on my eyes right now and then
the two lower lashline shades that I
used cake batter and cookie dough I mean
again you can get it there you can get
the shades there but you really have to
take your time and build the shades up
cookie dough has like the sheen to it
has some shimmer to it and honestly it's
pretty hard to see like even when i
swatched it i really didn't get much of
like the shimmer effect to it and then
on my eyes I honestly think it's more
indulge and the glitter around my eyes
that I'm seeing than what I'm seeing
from cookie dough so overall this first
impression makeup tutorial I don't think
was great definitely frustrating because
when I did the swatches I mean you can
probably tell in the video that I was I
was getting pretty frustrated with how
they were swatching and just how it was
coming out and I was like you know what
I just need to do with the tutorial I
need to see what it's like on my eyes it
could be completely different like don't
just base your opinion on just simply
swatching a palette you know you have to
put it to to the test but unfortunately
this eye makeup look I'm not very happy
with I'm not happy about the fall out
I'm not happy about just how sheer the
shades are and I'm not happy about how
many times you have to go in and build
up colors you know the last first
impression makeup tutorial I did was on
the modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia and you see me slightly
dipping my brush into a shade and
starting to apply it and being like wow
that's so pigmented like whoa I might
even put too much on it I just
you know casually dipped my brush in it
whereas what this one I'm putting my
brush in a shade five to six times just
to get some sort of color payoff so
unfortunately right now I can't say that
it's looking great for the white
chocolate chip palette from Too Faced I
still will do one more I make up a look
I will do it for Instagram so if you
don't follow me on Instagram on March
Beauty word I will post another mini
tutorial over there I will try to use
the black shade in the tutorial I can
tell you guys it doesn't swatch well and
all its watches very like chalky and dry
and really not a lot of shimmer to it so
I do have somewhere to be right after
this so I really didn't want to go in
with that black knowing that I probably
wasn't gonna like it so I can do I can
incorporate that black in my Instagram
tutorial when I know that I can just
wipe my makeup off and go along with my
day so yeah follow me over on Instagram
because I'll do one more tutorial over
there and then I can do probably like a
snapchat or scratch it on the palette
but I want to try to do a fair chance
and give all the shades a try and see
what kind of feedback I can get because
maybe you want this palette for you know
just a few certain shades or whatever it
is it may be so I can try to test out
more shades but right now unfortunately
it's just really not looking good for
the to face with white chocolate chip
palette which makes me really really sad
I don't have any of the chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced and I know that
they're really loved so I thought this
would be a fun way to kind of get in on
that craze get a smaller palette you
know I mean it's teeny tiny but good for
trouble it still has a mirror in it I
thought the shades were really pretty in
pictures and you know even saving a
little bit of money going with the
smaller palette but right now it's not
looking like it's it's gonna be worth my
money at which is disappointing but
hopefully this video helped you guys out
and I hope that you enjoyed the tutorial
your guys's feedback down below have you
guys gotten the white chocolate chip
palette what do you think of it did you
get the chocolate chip palette the UM
matte palette what do you think of that
one I'm just really curious to get your
feedback so let me know what you think
down in the comments below but now yes I
do need to go finish off even more of my
makeup
and get ready to head out but I hope
that you guys enjoyed seeing that little
mini eye tutorial thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you'll give
it a thumbs up if you did enjoy it make
