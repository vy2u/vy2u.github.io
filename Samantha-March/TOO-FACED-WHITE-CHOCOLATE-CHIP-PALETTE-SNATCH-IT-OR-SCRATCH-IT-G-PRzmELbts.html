today's video is going to be my next
edition of snatch it or scratch it and
it's going to be on the two-faced white
chocolate chip palette so I have done a
couple videos so far on the white
chocolate chip pilot there was a lot of
curiosity when these released I made
sure to give it early so I'd be able to
talk about it on my channel and now I am
coming in with my final thoughts and
letting you guys know if I think that
you should get this one or if I think
that you should pass it I will leave my
first impression and swatches video down
below and then also my makeup tutorial
that I used um using this palette I'll
leave those linked down below if you
have seen those videos you probably know
where this video is going if you haven't
seen them maybe you'll be surprised but
so the two-faced white chocolate chip
pellet is twenty-six dollars is not
currently for sale this was exclusive to
sephora and they let the vib rouge
members purchase at the night before
cyber monday and then it released on
Cyber Monday sold out very quickly
middle it is supposed to be a mini
version of like the chocolate bar
palette that two-faced is very well
known for they came out with the white
chocolate chip palette which is a
mixture of Matt and shimmers they also
released the chocolate chip palette
which is an all matte palette I decided
to go with the white chocolate chip
palette I did talk about these in one of
my will i buy it videos I will leave
that video link down below as well as my
playlist for I will i buy it videos so
inside you do have 11 different shades
you do have a mirror so again I mean I
don't feel like I really need to like
beat around the bush here because I have
done to other videos on this palette
what I say to snatch it or scratch it
I'm gonna go ahead and tell you guys to
scratch it I was completely underwhelmed
with this palette I was just not happy
in the slide Nestle on first impressions
when I first got it it is it a tiny
palette yes I mean yes it's a teeny tiny
little palette but that's fine size of
it was kind of like okay like what I
didn't realize that was going to be that
small but you know inside I was hoping
that the actual like pants sizes would
be bigger there's what they look like I
was hoping they would be bigger
but they're not but then also it's okay
you know it doesn't matter how big the
pellet is and it doesn't matter helping
the pant sizes are you know if the
product that we're getting is really
really good then it won't matter but
unfortunately it's not good when I did
the swatches I was like oh man those did
not select fall and I was like don't
panic do an eye makeup tutorial and I
did and I was so underwhelmed like I
mean you can probably tell in the video
where I'm doing the tutorial that was
the first time that I was using the
palette on my eyes I was just in a bad
mood I was in a bad mood filling that
video I didn't even want to post it but
I was like people need to see what it
actually performs like on the eyes just
because I don't like the way that the
look came out or how the palette worked
it doesn't mean i can just grab a video
because that was the point of making
these videos so i mean you can you can
tell I was pretty frustrated with it
I've tried this palette two more times
using I've used every single shade now
and the palette on my eyes I do have a
tutorial on Instagram as well if it's
not all if it is already up i'll leave
it linked down below but otherwise i'm
just marched beauty word on an instagram
i do a lot of swatches and tutorials
over there as well and I swear do you
like just every time I i have used this
palette it has put me in a bad mood like
it's giving me bad energy I just it does
and it's just it's so sad but it does
i'm actually going to return this polish
to sephora which I very very rarely
return my cup um you know being on
YouTube it's nice to be able even if I
don't love something I can probably use
it sometime I can have a comparison
video dupes video you know something
along those lines but I really I can't
see myself ever using this palette again
I've tried I've tried the different
shades I've tried different combinations
I've tried I really gave it my best
effort and I'm just so highly
unimpressed with it and I just I would
prefer to have my $26 back I mean Timmy
$26 isn't even that much money like it's
not like I through fifty dollars at it a
hundred dollars i have it 150 dogs out i
mean there's just no reason for me to
keep this palette around because I just
I didn't love it go saying like first
impression like yeah it's mild the pant
sizes are small i was hoping i could I
could look away from that but I real
cuttin also it is pretty cheap the
plastic packaging it's not like the
usual liked in packaging like the sweet
peach has and what I believe the
chocolate bar palette has so I do like
the fact that it has a mirror I think
that's good other than that just the
actual quality of what is inside the
pellet just is not good so I'm really
sad about it but like I said I'll lead
those two videos link down below because
you can see me swatching the palette you
can see me trying to use it on my eyes
and it's just not working out these are
just so light I mean maybe if you like I
shadows that are very minimal very light
at eat I mean you might like this one a
lot of them are just very patchy very
chalky the fallout is very extreme on
all of them especially these shimmer
shades like these two right here are
very shimmery shades and you are just
going to get glitter all around your
eyes and just so many of them are just
not pigmented enough they just they
barely show up I tried using this black
as a liner and the black is very
interesting because it has a lot of like
reflects it in like shimmer in it but
when you actually watch it and even put
it on your eyes it just shows up as a
very pale black shade I don't know it's
very it's very strange so unfortunately
this palette was just a Miss for me on
every single mark basically a cute idea
I was excited about this because I don't
own any of the chocolate bar palette and
so I was like maybe this is a way to
kind of get a mini version of a
chocolate bar palette I've said it in so
many my videos and i'm not a huge i
shadow palette junkie because a lot of
times I feel like we don't need like the
zillions of shades that you get an
eyeshadow palette so I was like this you
know might be perfect for me save a
little bit of money get a little guy
easy to travel with you know like
straightforward shades in there like
this sounds like something that would
really be up my alley and that's why I
want it to buy it and unfortunately it
just did not work out for me and like I
said I do not return make up a lot I'm
not someone who gets something and is
like oh you know it's okay but i'm just
going to return it because i put a lot
of consideration into what it is that
i'm purchasing for makeup that's why I
have my will
by at videos and I talked my way through
it and I talked my way through it on
camera as well and I do try to put a lot
of consideration and get things that I
really want I really know that I will
use I'll really be able to get a use out
of because I don't like the idea of
returning something I mean I just like i
said i feel like the pellet gives me bad
energy I really do but I know that I
will never use it again like I put it to
the test I tried I really give it my
best effort I wanted to make sure like
maybe there's you know handful of shades
in here that I'm like oh I absolutely
need these shades I'll keep this palette
around for that reason but there's not
all of the shades were a Miss for me
except except this one right here which
i believe is exotica that's the only
shade that I actually like out of this
palette but it was still too light in
order to actually get it to the
intensity that I want it I did have to
use a setting spray or I used my fixed
plus to get it to where I wanted and I
don't feel like you should have to use
something like fix plus in order to get
an eyeshadow to work I feel like you
should use it to enhance something you
know make it more metallic that sort of
thing but it was only really after i
used the fix plus that i was like i
really do like this shade it's a really
pretty kind of like shimmery color and
there's really not a lot of fallout with
that one so out of the entire 11 shades
in here that was the only one I liked
and I still had to use fix plus to get
it to where I want it so unfortunately
for me this one was a big miss I'm
definitely gonna have to say to scratch
it I have been watching more videos and
you know looking at more on Instagram
and seeing the other feedbacks and you
know of course there are people that do
like this palette you know not everybody
is going to hate something not
everybody's going to love something
we're all going to be different so I
have definitely seen positive reviews on
it but the majority that I'm seeing is
not so good reviews on it so in my
personal opinion i'm going to tell you
guys to scratch it the price in what
you're getting inside just doesn't seem
to be worth it and what I'm hearing is
that you know just go ahead and get the
chocolate bar palette if you really do
want it from Too Faced so I'm really
bummed i was really excited about it and
i just hate having to return makeup but
this one will be going back so i say
scratch the two-faced white chocolate
chip pellet I'm so sorry but it was just
a really really big miss I haven't been
this disappointed and I make a product
in a very long time so that one is going
to be a Miss for me but hopefully my
videos helped you out if you were
curious about picking it up once it does
be released again I hope that my videos
helped you out again I will leave my
other two link down below but hopefully
this was a help for you guys but so for
this edition of snatch it or scratch it
I'm saying scratch it on the toothpaste
white chocolate chip pellet I hope you
guys are finding these videos helpful
because I'm having a lot of fun making
them hopefully the next one will be a
little bit better but I hope you will
give this video a thumbs up if you did
enjoy it make sure you are subscribed
before you go and i'll catch you real
soon in my next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
