today's video is going to be all about
the new two-faced white chocolate chip
palette oh yes here we go first of all
if you are new here thank you so much
for coming by my channel my name is
meanza I post videos about four or five
times a week so I hope that you will hit
the subscribe button so you'll be
notified when I post future videos but
yes today we are going to be talking
about this new release from Too Faced I
also want to point out real quick this
is my first video filming with a light
if you are not new to my channel you
know that I've always filmed with just
natural light and I've never had any
real lighting I recently purchased a
softbox and I am filming with that so I
don't know for sure exactly how the
lighting is gonna be I've tried to do a
couple test videos just to be sure but
in case you think something looks off or
looks wonky or I don't know something
it's because I'm filming for the first
time like a first like real for real
video with a softbox I can leave my
lights link down below in case you're
interested I just got him off Amazon and
they were pretty inexpensive and I'm
just using one of the soft boxes and I'm
actually filming at night so this whole
video is just like super weird to me but
you know what let's just go with it but
like I said it's gonna be all about this
new palette it was just released from
Too Faced so I'm excited for it I
seriously just got it in the mail so I
haven't been able to play with it yet
but why don't we go ahead open it up and
see what this is all about
okay so first this is what the packaging
looks like so we got the Too Faced white
chocolate chip palette so it says this
white chocolate chip palette features 11
cocoa powder and fused buttery shades
and pastels creamy nudes and a pop of
black all with our signature chocolate
scents okay and then when you open it up
this is what the actual palette looks
like a close-up of the palette this is
$26 I got mine on Sephora the white
chocolate chip palette is exclusive to
Sephora it was supposed to release I
believe it was Black Friday I was what I
was originally told and then it actually
didn't come out until Cyber Monday it
was released the night before on Sunday
night only for vib Rouge members on
Sephora that is when I purchased it
while I was able to get a little bit
early so when you open it up there is a
mirror here which I'll try to cover so
I'm not blinding anyone and then here is
a close-up of the shades okay so first
impression when I opened it up and took
out this palettes the first thing that
ran through my head I'm going to be
completely honest was this looks like
children's makeup that was my first that
was my first opinion I'm just gonna be
really real so I mean this is plastic I
don't own any of the chocolate bar
palettes from Too Faced which is why I
thought I would get this because they
released this and the chocolate chip
palette which is an all matte palette
which is exclusive to the toothpaste
website they released these around the
same time and they're supposed to be
kind of like the chocolate bar palettes
like mixed together favorite shades that
sort of thing and so I think if you own
the chocolate bar palette you probably
wouldn't need these mini palettes but
since I don't own any of them
I picked the white chocolate chip
palette together it just kind of spoke
to me more I liked that it had the mat
in the shimmers so the size is is very
small I mean I mean I mean it's a teeny
tiny little palette for reference this
is the Too Faced sweet peach palette and
this is a white chocolate chip palette
but I believe this was $49 this was $26
so I don't know that's just to give you
some idea but then even the shades are
very very small I can go ahead and try
to do a comparison of these like so the
actual pan sizes are of course much much
smaller
right off the bat kind of what I think
is that I don't think this should have
been $26 I mean just my honest opinion
right off the bat seeing this I did not
realize it was going to be this small I
truly didn't I did I knew it was gonna
be a mini palette I knew I wasn't giving
this in the mail for $26 but I wasn't
expecting
something this small
so without swatching it without playing
with it I'm slightly disappointed in the
size and I'm just a little disappointed
at how teeny tiny the actual pan shades
are those are very very small if we
compare it to the peach collection so
the eye shadows are point five grams and
then in the peach palette they are point
nine five grams so I mean there's an
idea I think I have that correct
hopefully I do eleven shades in here
eighteen shades in here so I mean I
guess I mean that's just kind of like my
first thoughts when I opened it up when
I looked at the package when I held it
in my hand and saw how small it was but
yeah let's go ahead let's see what the
shades look like I mean I am really
really crossing my fingers that these
are just gonna be like the bomb diggity
but why don't we just go ahead and jump
into some swatches on the back it does
list the names which is nice because
obviously the packaging is so tiny
there's no place to actually like put
the names on here but let's just go
ahead you guys know I don't have a huge
swatch game but I'll go ahead and give
it a try okay so right off the bat it's
actually hard to swatch because it's so
small like my fingers like no that's not
where you're supposed to go okay so this
is the top row so this is glaze which is
the big shade ambrosia and exotica so
there is on my fingers so I don't know
how well you're gonna be able to see
these I might try to insert some
pictures as well but to be completely
honest with you that's that that wasn't
great and now I'm getting a little bit
nervous I was only the first row but the
first shade which is glaze which is the
larger shade here it's just like chalk I
mean it actually looks like chalk to me
okay so that one was very disappointing
the next one is ambrosia so that is this
shade right here
it's like a light matte pink shade and
it is barely showing up oh my this one
is pretty exotica if you can see it on
my finger there that one is pretty it's
a very pretty like almost like a rose
gold champagne e type of shimmery color
that one is really pretty and is showing
up really well but out of the first
three that's really about the only shade
that's actually showing up so the first
two are pretty disappointing but let's
try the next two rows and see what
happens fingers crossed okay so we're
gonna keep it rolling I'm gonna do the
second row next
so it's pearl candy raspberry Rose
indulge and guilt-free again just oh
that one is chalky Oh guys I'm feeling a
little nervous right now I'm not gonna
lie okay let's just try though never
know until you try
here is the second row so we have pearl
candy raspberry Rose indulge and
guilt-free this first one right here
which is pearl candy I mean it's okay
it's showing up really well as a swatch
but it is very very chalky very very
crumbly I would feel pretty worried
about putting that one on my eyes so
this one right here is raspberry rose
and I mean it's like a pretty like very
light pink shimmery shade just a little
bit of a sheen to it I don't know if I
would say it's shimmery or more just has
like a light sheen to it but it's not
showing up the best well my first one is
just way too chalky
the next one it's such a light light
color that it's really not showing up
the best the third one which is indulge
that's a pretty fun shimmery shade that
one's pretty good and then the last one
which is guilt-free I like this one it's
just kind
like a cool toned matte shade it's
almost like a grey purple and I do like
that one but man I'm getting a little
I'm still getting a little nervous here
guys these swatches aren't going how I
was hoping they would go so I'll go
ahead and swatch the last row now so the
last row is cake batter cookie dough
sugared raisin and then black sugar okay
so here those are our really
disappointing Wow
I was hoping this video was gonna go a
lot better but Wow um the last four the
first two I mean I know that I'm saying
it might be hard to see it because of
the lights but I can't even see the
swatches and I actually went back in two
times and tried to build up the swatches
one is kind of like a very muted peach
color the other one it looks like it's
supposed to have some sparkle to it but
really nothing's happening
overall first impressions you guys I
just I don't even I don't I don't even
know what to say at this point so this
shade right here looks like it has some
sparkle in it but there's barely any
sparkle showing up the third shade which
is sugared raisin that one is actually
pretty that one is nice the black one is
barely black at all again barely any
shimmer to it I mean when you look at it
in the palette it looks like it's just a
ton of shimmer there's barely any
shimmer to it at all
and it looks just like dry and patchy
Wow I I have to say first impressions
after I'm doing the swatches is I'm
actually pretty disappointed at this and
that bums me out so much that is I was
so excited about this palette that's why
I got it that's why I got it early
that's why I was waiting anxiously for
the ups to get here because I was really
excited for it but based on these
swatches I'm just not super
impressed right now again I haven't
tried it on my eyes I am definitely
going to try a couple looks I will try
this out on my eyes if you guys want to
see me film a tutorial so you can see it
in person as well and see what we're
getting from this palette please do
leave that in the comments below because
I will be happy to film a first
impression makeup tutorial with this but
just based on the swatches I can't say
that I'm super excited so basically all
of the mattes in here are just really
not up to snuff which makes me really
curious how the chocolate chip palette
is inside is all Matt I'm just very
curious what its gonna come out like the
shimmers in here there's a couple of the
shimmers that I think are very very
pretty but some of these that are
supposed to be shimmery there's there's
no sparkle to them there's no glitter to
them it just looks very strange again I
will try to insert a photo here of all
the swatches on my arm so you guys can
see them I will share swatch photos on
my Instagram as well
I am arch beauty word if you want to see
more if you want to see me do the first
impression I make up tutorial with this
palette as well please do just leave
that in the comments below and let me
know but overall first impressions I'm
gonna have to say that I'm actually
pretty disappointed with this palette
that really really bums me out for $26 I
mean I was expecting maybe a bigger
palette I don't I don't know you know I
was like maybe it's not a big deal if
the palette is so small the actual pan
sizes you know are not bad but the pan
sizes are just tiny and then just the
way this is swatching and the actual
swatches are just not not going well
like I said I'll definitely do an eye
makeup tutorial and try to see if maybe
it comes out better on the eyes
definitely could so I mean I'm not
saying that you need to pass on this
quite yet because I don't feel like
that's fair to say without actually
trying it on my eyes and seeing what it
would look like then but first
impressions is not not so good for the
Too Faced white chocolate chip palette
I'm so sorry to say that that really
blows does anyone else have this did you
get it have you tried it out please
leave it in the comments below do you
love it is there certain shades that you
love I would absolutely love to know
that
but I'm now very very anxious to get
into this to try it out with a makeup
tutorial so hopefully that will be
coming soon
again this is $26 it is exclusive to
Sephora at the time that I'm filming it
is sold out but it will be coming backs
$26 11 shades you're getting a
combination of matte and shimmer shades
so yeah that's gonna wrap it up for my
first impression and swatch video for
the Too Faced white chocolate chip
palette I'm sorry that couldn't go
better I was very very excited about
this palette so I'm coming off just a
little bit disappointed but like I said
I'm gonna give a tutorial a try and see
what happens so leave me your feedback

of the palette what did you think of the
swatches do you have it will you get it
