today's video is going to be a
back-to-school video and I'm going to
going through like my top 10 makeup
beauty essentials for back to school so
I did recently do a big back to school
giveaway and after I posted it I asked
my snapchat you know do you guys want to
see more back-to-school videos because
they seem to be pretty popular here on
YouTube and everybody was saying yes so
I don't go to school I'm 29 years old
one I'm a little bit removed from school
these days but I thought well I could
still do a couple videos so of course I
will do a makeup tutorial I don't do a
whole lot of tutorials on my channel
because I'm not sort of and you know
like makeup artist or makeup
professional in any sort of the sense so
I don't do a ton of tutorials but I will
definitely do a back to school makeup
look I did recently post an a fordable
look it's more of like in a daytime glam
type of looks maybe like school picture
day or something kind of look but i will
definitely that's probably my next back
to school video that I'll do is a makeup
look so this one is going to be my top
10 makeup essentials and I'm really
excited for it I think mostly everything
that I have to show you is affordable or
from the drugstore from affordable brand
something like that and that was another
thing that when people were talking to
me on the snapchat that they kept
stressing that they wanted to see
affordable options as well so that is
what I tried to do here for you guys but
yeah if you would like to see my top 10
back to school and makeup essentials
please keep watching okay so this is a
newer product to me but I've kind of
become obsessed with it it's from pixi
by Petra and it is their glow missed so
this is what it looks like I did pick it
up from target it was fifteen dollars
which actually is a little bit expensive
I did just put this in my beauty
newsletter as well I do send out a
beauty newsletter every single month
just once a month and i have like
reviews and their stand out products i
talk about new products that are coming
out and things like that i did talk
about this one because i recently bought
it and I want it to review it and I do
plan on doing a video as well featuring
this in a review it is a little bit
expensive for how much product that
you're getting especially compared to
some other makeups praise but seriously
this is really really good and if you
want instant results like you want an
instant whoa my face just got really
glowy this is going to be a good one for
you I remember the first time I tried it
I was like well I was not expecting that
like I you know like with like mac fix+
you can just like douse your face in it
you're like yeah I'm looking good if you
like douse your face in this it's like
whoa that was a little too much like two
sprays of this seriously it works but
this would be really great to put in
your backpack or in your purse if you
just need a little refresher moment you
can spray yourself and if you think
you're looking a little bit dull if
you've gone through a couple classes of
the day you've been walking around and
your your makeups looking a little crazy
just just spray this and you'll get an
instant glow and it helps hydrate and
refresh the face though I've really been
liking this from pixi by Petra so I said
this and many times on my channel but I
am a huge eyeliner junkie when I was
going through what makeup I wanted to
share with you guys I didn't really want
to put a foundation and a blush and
bronzer and a you know I don't want to
go through the entire thing because a
lot of those things aren't truly what I
think are essentials so I was just
trying to grab what i would want to grab
if that makes sense and the one thing
that I have to have and I know this
isn't for everybody but I just have to
have eyeliner i love my liner I have to
wear eyeliner I look very young and sick
if I don't wear eyeliner since it's not
very common to catch me without eyeliner
but the liners that I want to talk about
our from colour-pop these are their
cream gel liners in the pencil form I
have five of them I actually think i
have another one but i can't find it but
i have five of them I think they're
fantastic I have a couple of like fun
colored ones but ones that i would
recommend if you just want to like put a
pop of eyeliner on the waterline this is
a new one from colour-pop and it's in
collaboration with kathleenlights it's
mr. Bing I have it on today on my lower
waterline and the nice much of into the
lower lash line as well it's just a
really pretty like very warm rich brown
and I think it looks just so so pretty
if you like metallics get paid is one
that is really good as well and then I
actually have another one on my top lash
line I have on maybe from colour-pop so
I love these liners I think they stay
all day
like even when I wash my face at the end
of the night I have to like take a
makeup wipe and really like work to
remove the eyeliner because it stays on
so well these are only five dollars i
believe it is so it's super super
affordable I don't feel like enough
people talk about these pencil liners
from Clara pot because they are amazing
and I definitely think they are back to
school essential so I also wanted to
touch on brushes these are not brushes
that I feel like I talked about enough i
think when i first started my channel i
definitely talked about these brushes
quite a bit because they were all I had
but now as I'm getting into more brushes
and being able to talk about different
brands and companies I've kind of like
stopped talking about these brushes but
if you guys are looking for good
affordable brushes especially if you are
like new and make up check out bh
cosmetics now i only have four brushes
here but i have two full sets of brushes
from BH Cosmetics and it's kind of cool
because both deaths that I ordered came
in like really nice makeup bags like the
one I still use every single time I
travel I think it came with 15 brushes
so it has 15 different places for me to
be able to put my makeup brushes in and
then it folds up really nicely and kind
of like clips together I think it's
really cool so they have really amazing
sets like I said I bought two full sets
from them and I've also bought a few
individual brushes from bhcosmetics as
well they are very affordable they
really really helped me out in the
beginning when I was first learning to
start makeup and I just think they are
really cool but especially if you can
give us that and you can get like a
makeup bag as well that will be really
awesome so yeah if you're looking for
some good affordable brushes because
brushes of course are essential to our
makeup check out BH Cosmetics this is
not makeup per se but hey we always have
to have nice looking nails except for me
today because I don't have nails on but
my favorite brand of nail polish and has
been for so long as the Sally Hansen
miracle gel line now I'm holding three
here and I probably have at least eight
more in my nail polish container I
seriously love this brand of nail polish
but I think having pretty nails always
looks really nice like I said I don't
want my nails on today I usually have
fake nails on but I do not at the time
I'm letting my real nails take a breath
and breathe but these are just my
absolute favorite favorite and they have
so many different colors to choose from
and they last so long not just
top of fake nails but on real nails they
last forever and honestly even without
like a top coat primer for your nails I
barely ever use one because these just
stay on for so long and I thought like
these really like pastel e-type colors
were really pretty so this blue one is
in grey fede so it looks it's more like
a blue-gray like I think when you look
at it right here like at least in person
it definitely looks more like a very
light blue on the nails it's it's blue
grey but I think it's a really pretty
color and then this purple one is called
all chalked up again it's like a purple
grey if you can tell i really enjoy
greys this one is oh this has been my
favorite for so long i think i just
mentioned it in my favourites video
actually two and it is Malibu peach I
freaking love this color so much so
while we can hang on to pastels well we
can before the fall and winter months
come but even then I have a lot of like
darker colors as well from the sally
hansen gel line and they have they have
a lot of really good news too i mean
they just have a huge color selection so
check out Sally Hansen if you want good
nail polish so mascara that have to
mention because mascaras another thing
that I feel like I just like is
essential to me I feel like my eyes
always look really weird when I don't
have mascara on and when it comes to
back to school like I prefer to wear
eyelashes myself but like in that middle
school and high school and even college
like when you're going to class ain't
nobody got time to put false lashes on
like sometimes if I'm rushed to film a
video I will skip the false lashes
because I use natural lighting to film
videos and so sometimes like I gotta
hurry up and get in front of this camera
quick and get recording and I'm like
nope I don't have time to mess around
with the adhesive and making sure the
lashes to know don't have time for it so
definitely for me lashes are now back to
school essential but having nice looking
natural lashes is so my favorite mascara
from the drugstore hands down I
mentioned just so many times on my
channel but it is the Maybelline lash
sensational I absolutely adore this
mascara I think it does amazing things
for the eyes it's very affordable as
well and it's just it's just a good one
for your collection moving on to an eye
shad
talent that I want to touch on I think
these are so cute they're very small
like you can fit them in a backpack or
in a purse even but they are from wet
and wild I've like these little like
trio guys right here I have mine in
silent treatment and I think this is
really pretty for even like if you want
to do like a smoky eye to I've done a
lot of smokey eyes with this one because
this shade is such a pretty like deeper
shade but these two colors I especially
use all the time even for a more natural
look but these so they're called the
color icons I think these trios are so
good and so many different people talk
about them i need like dude I need a lot
more of these I've seen a lot of
different colors from wet and wild but
they're also very affordable too so if
you just want something like real quick
for an eyeshadow look I would check out
these wet and wild trios so I do think a
makeup essential is lip gloss I was a
huge lip gloss person i can recall back
back in my days so far away they like
the whole matte lip trend was not in yet
and it was making your lips very large
either so i was always obsessed with lip
gloss and one of my favorite lip glosses
as of recently is from nick and it is
there butter gloss in fortune cookie
this is such a beautiful like super
super natural lip gloss this would be
especially good for younger students as
well like if you just want like a little
bit of shine a little bit of on your
lips fortune cookie is a really good
option it's just it's just so very
natural and i love it was actually my
first butter gloss that i purchased from
NYX I got the shade fortune cookie
because I heard Buster looks talked
about it and she really likes lip gloss
so I was like okay I'm gonna try that
one and I'm really glad that I ended up
with this color because I just think
it's such a beautiful topper but I also
appreciate these glasses are not sticky
because I cannot stand sticky lip
glosses and these are not and they're
affordable also one other lip product
that i wanted to mention maybe for a
little bit older and you like having a
bit of color on your lips these are from
colour-pop the color that i pulled out
is Alyssa this is in their ultra satin
finish so alyssa is a really pretty like
everyday daytime pink color it's just
absolutely gorgeous it is in
collaboration with kathleen lights and
I think this color is just phenomenal
and if you're in high school to you'd be
able to pull it off as well I really
love the ultra satin formulas these were
actually the first ones that i purchased
in the colour-pop ultra sentence I have
a ton a ton of their ultra matte liquid
lipsticks and I've always really liked
them but when Kathleen came out with
this collab ended up buying all three of
her lippies and I was like why have I
not tried the satin lips before because
i like these ten times better than I
like the ultra mats it is such a much
more comfortable feeling on the lips
it's not as drying on the lips it
doesn't do the weird drying cracking
thing on your lips either but the color
stays on for so long these colors stick
on my lips even when I eat dinner it's
still on there they're so beautiful
they're comfortable I think the ultra
satin lips are a definite definite yes
for your makeup collection but for your
back-to-school essential I would check
out the color Alyssa because it's such a
beautiful shade so I didn't want to be
sure to mention a face powder because
even on days like today I actually
actually wasn't gonna film today and I
started to do my makeup because I'm
going to a movie tonight and then I was
like you know what let's just let's just
go with it but actually the only thing
that I have on my skin is a BB cream and
then I put a powder on top of it and a
lot of days even if I don't want like
the extra step of a BB cream but I want
my skin tone they look like just a
little bit like evened out just just
just a little bit better you know like
me but a little bit better i will use a
powder and one that i especially love is
from maybelline and it is the fit me
powder and mean obviously if you can
tell i love this powder when i run out
of it i definitely have to get another
one because i think they are amazing i'm
in the shade 310 and it's from the fit
me matte and poreless powder so just
want to throw that out there the my
favorite brush that i love using this
with is the III from morphe i can link
that down below as well along with all
the other products that i'm talking
about i will do my best to find them and
link them down below for you guys so you
can easily find anything if there's
anything that you do want to check into
but this powder is amazing I i use it so
often it's just it's one of my absolute
favorites and I definitely
having a good powder is such an
essential for your back to school makeup
bag if you just need a quick touch-up
throughout the day this is going to do
the job my tenth and final item that I
want to talk about it is another eye
shadow palette so this might be good for
a little bit older girls as well if you
want a few more options than like the
wet and wild trio would give you but the
palette that I definitely recommend for
your back-to-school essential bag is
from BH Cosmetics and carli bybel it is
the 14 color eye shadow and highlight or
palette that they did together it's
really great because it does have a
mirror so if you need to be doing your
makeup look on the run or in the
classroom like I did often in college
then it does have a mirror but then this
is what the inside looks like so you
have the 14 different eye shadows up
here and then you have four different
highlighters down here i have used the
highlighters as I shadows as well so I
thought this would be a really good
option for the back to school essentials
as well because i didn't put in a
highlighter because truly I love
highlight I love highlights so much not
sure I consider it like essential
essential in my back to school bag but
that's what I thought this one would be
so great because you do have the
highlight our options down here as well
which i think is great there's so many
different looks that you can do with
this eyeshadow palette when I first got
this palette I was like yeah i see about
three different looks that i can do with
this and the more I've had it and the
more I've been experimenting with it
it's just I mean you have so many
different options to do in here and I
just think it is gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous palette and it's super
affordable as well and now you can find
them in all the stores also I think
they're also in all the also stores as
well which is really exciting but this
is just a great palette to have anyways
and when I definitely recommend for back
to school good thing for my top 10 back
to school makeup essentials I really
hope that you guys like the list that i
accumulated for you this was almost kind
of like another favorites video for me

fun to do I tried to make sure that I
