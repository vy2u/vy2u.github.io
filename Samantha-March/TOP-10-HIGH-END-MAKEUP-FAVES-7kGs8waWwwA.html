today's video is going to be my top 10
high end makeup products so I recently
did a top ten drugstore like must-haves
from the drugstore and it was suggested
that I also do like a top 10 feature on
my high end products now for the
drugstore of like these are must-have
products yada yada I'm not going to say
these are must-have products because
they can be quite expensive and truly I
don't think anything like this expensive
is considered a must-have for you so I'm
not trying to tell you where to spend
your money I'm just saying out of my
makeup collection that I have these are
my top 10 personal favorites the ones
that I constantly recommend that i keep
recommending some of these I've been
recommending for years and using myself
for years so these are just my favorite
favorite high-end products and i
actually did pick 10 of them i'm pretty
sure my drugstore it was 11 but i'm
pretty sure this one is 10 so i did a
good job but yeah if you would like to
see my top 10 picks for my high end
makeup products please keep watching so
two products that I've been using for
such a long time and I'm constantly
recommending them they are both from Too
Faced actually and first one is the
better than sex mascara this mascara
truly I mean I think I've been using it
since it came out and i love it i have
many versions of this I've gone through
probably at least 2 if not more of the
full-sized ones I've gone through
several of the mini versions whenever I
see it's like you get a deluxe sample of
this was like a two faced purchase I'm
like yes I gotta have it because I truly
just love this mascara so much i can
show you guys the one if you haven't
seen it but this mascara has been out
here for years and it's also a favorite
of so many peoples it just does amazing
things for your lashes and makes them
longer and makes them fuller and make
some thicker they look so pretty if I
still want really like glamorous looking
lashes but I don't want to do false
lashes I will reach for the Too Faced
better than sex mascara the other item
from Too Faced is a bronzer and it is
there chocolate Soleil bronzer so I
actually have mine in a deluxe sample
and honestly I've had this for so long
and I use it so often that I'm
like how have I not gone through this
thing yet like I seriously cannot figure
it out it's one of my favorite bronzers
I'm constantly recommending it I think
it is so gorgeous this one is the
medium/deep bronzer and again it's the
chocolate Soleil there's also like a
milk chocolate bronzer I believe and
they have to face just has a ton of
brothers out there but the chocolate
Soleil bronzer is a little bit deeper
and I just think it is gorgeous at some
of newer products to me as well but some
i have just simply fallen in love with
this one I actually received it from a
sigma beauty and I was so grateful
because I immediately fell in love and
it has been so hard for me to use a
different eyeliner self course I'm
talking about the Sigma gel liner in
wicked it's a black gel liner and it is
freaking phenomenal I recommend this all
the time since what the inside looks
like mine's probably like really crazy
looking because I use it all the time I
do have it on my eyes today I think it's
just a phenomenal eyeliner and
especially when you pair it with the
sigma e 06 winged liner brush it's a
very like teeny tiny little liner brush
that Sigma also sent to me which I was
blown away from because those two
together especially instantly became
favorites of mine but if you haven't
checked out the Sigma gel liner yet he
gets to then the other product was
actually sent to me in an influencer box
and I had wanted to get the product
because i'm such a highlight junkie if
you guys know what i'm going to say but
I didn't do it because of the price tag
kind of freaked me out and I thought it
was too much for one product so when I
saw influenster was sending me one I was
like ok but it is the Marc Jacobs
glowstick highlighter and spotlight I
just mentioned this in a favorites video
I use it in so many so many of my
tutorials and this is what it looks like
almost like a stick of deodorant it's
like a gold and silver highlight again I
just I've talked about it so much I
don't really know what else I could say
except that i think it's gorgeous and
makes the skin look dewy i think it
looks good on so many different skin
tones I've seen so many different people
wearing this and they all look so
beautiful in it oh definitely definitely
I think is worth it so moving on to the
face I have a high-end concealer that I
really really ended up falling in love
with and is from Tarte it's their
rainforest of the sea aqua concealer
this one i ordered it during the Sephora
via be sale and i actually got it in
like such a wrong shade it was like
almost white on me so my shade now is
light medium in case you're wondering
but I was so bummed because I actually
tries a really light one and i was like
i know this color is all wrong but i
love this concealer like I have to go
get a new one so i went into sephora and
actually did my exchange there but this
is what the wand looks like it's a
pretty like big applicator for a
concealer it was a little like you know
i opened it was like oh okay and it also
has a very strong smell almost kind of
like a paint smell which is a little
weird the one thing i will say about
this is then it dries super super
quickly so typically when i'm using this
as a concealer i will put it under one I
first and then I will buff it out and I
will set it and then I will go to the
other eye because it does dry very
quickly I find barely any creasing with
this which I enjoy so much when I'm
going somewhere and I know that I need
something to put underneath my eyes that
is not going to crease like I need it
all day with no creasing this is what I
tend to go for no matter what setting
powder i'm using this one is just doing
phenomenal things it's also a very like
thin and almost like watery consistency
and so when i first used it i was like i
don't know if this is going to be very
like full coverage and actually hide
dark circles or like sometimes i have
redness around my under eyes but it does
it covers everything and it's not
irritating at all i don't like putting
super thick concealers on my under eyes
because that skin is so thin but i don't
know this was the consistency that it is
yet the coverage that you get it's a
good one and a favorite high-end
foundation of mine is from Clinique it's
there beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer this was another one that I
got in the Sephora vib sale it was
another one that I was completely wrong
picking on my shade it looked horrible
hug baby it was like the second lightest
shade that there is my shade now is in
6.5 buttermilk I think the one that I
originally picked up wasn't like shade
to like what but I started seeing a lot
of people talk about this and I feel
like I just mentioned this recently
maybe it was in my foundation routine
video but
no this is a higher-end brand this
foundation is only twenty seven dollars
which honestly like a lot of the other
higher-end foundations or more in like
40 50 even 60 dollar range so $27 really
is not that bad and like the l'oreal
what is that the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion is 1799 and that's drugstores so
you know but again this is what the
applicator looks like so very different
when it comes to foundation and so what
I do is like put stripes along my face
and then I will buff it in with either i
brush or at Beauty Blender it's a very
matte foundation in my opinion and I
definitely think it's more like medium
to full coverage like when I know I want
like more of a full coverage kind of day
this is the foundation that I'll go for
and what I'm looking for something
that's more mattifying because I think
it does a really good job at mattifying
the skin as well I've dry skin it might
not be the best for it like sometimes
when I have dry patches I don't think
the foundation looks the best on me
because it can kind of cling to them but
other than that I just think this is a
phenomenal foundation it is super super
Oh long lasting when I know I'm going to
be gone all day this is one of the
number one foundations that are read for
because I think it holds up so well they
have a lot of different shades out there
as well and again twenty seven dollars
for a home foundation I don't think you
can beat that so almost done I just have
some pallets left to talk about so first
one is a highlight palette is from
Anasazi Beverly Hills and it was her
glow kit in that glow who I got this
during this for VAV sale and decided to
splurge on it because it is forty
dollars which I know seems expensive but
you do get for really large highlighters
so it's actually really out of a deal if
you think about it but this particular
glow kid I absolutely love I own that
glow and I also own her new one in
sweets the that glow I just think is so
beautiful especially if you have a skin
tone maybe like similar to mine you
might find this easiest one one of the
easiest ones to work with I can't really
speak about the other ones but from what
I've seen out of them and other videos
that I've seen it seems like this one is
recommended a lot for people with my
skin tone which is the reason why I
originally bought this one but I love it
like Sun versus the only one that I
don't really wear
as a highlighter but I do it as like an
inner corner highlight quite a bit but
the other three I all do use as
highlighters and and I stuck my finger
nail in that one oh no but the other
three I do use as highlighters and I
also use them as I shadows and I think
they're really pretty as well I don't
dripping in gold and bubbly are just
like two of my favorites at these glow
kits I really do think they are good but
if I had to recommend any of the globe
kits from anastacio the one that I would
recommend the most is that glow a newer
item as well that i absolutely love is
from becca cosmetics and jaclyn hill and
it is the champagne glow face palette so
this is what it looks like and when you
open it up and has a very large mirror
which I like can't cover everything but
this is what it looks on the inside you
have three blushes on the top and then
you also have two highlights on the
bottom I truly do love this palette and
I mentioned it in my anti hall and I
said I I love this palette I do think
there was some weirdness around the
whole champagne glow face collection
that came out I'm not really positive on
everything that happened if you haven't
seen my anti holla I can link it down
below because I talked about a couple of
other products from this collection but
I do mention in that video as well that
I love this palette now I don't know
they say it's limited edition so I
thought about not talking about it but I
also hear all the time not only from
Becca cosmetics but from several
companies this is limited edition this
is limited edition you better get this
now because it's limited edition and
then it's not already a pro cycle pop
from this palette was being told that
it's a limited edition and it's not it's
back in split pants so I don't know so I
was like you know what I'm going to talk
about it because it really is like one
of my favorite pallets to use I use
amaretto as my blush today which is in
the middle but it has a champagne pop
which I do own champagne pop but i think
it's gorgeous if you don't have
champagne pop I definitely would
recommend getting it if I had decided
not to talk about this whole palette I
was going to talk about champagne pop in
particular because i love that
highlighter the Prosecco pop i think is
absolutely gorgeous if you guys do want
to purchase the split pans and not if
you can't get the full palette if it is
not around anymore or if you just don't
want to get the full palette because it
is $54
the split pans do have some of them who
do have Prosecco pop in it or champagne
pop and some have becca blushes or some
have these three bushes up here I
definitely recommend Rose a spritz which
is this really beautiful like shimmery
pinkish blush pink peach blush i think i
would say it's so gorgeous and then
amaretto is in the middle and it's such
a gorgeous neutral blush I did not
realize how much I was missing a neutral
blush in my collection truly I had no
idea until I got this palette I use it
all the time it is what's on my cheeks
today along with sassy grape from
Anasazi Beverly Hills sweets glow kid I
thought the purple would match my purple
I look that I have going on but Julie I
reach for this nearly every single day
if not for a blush for a highlight for
both I do think it's an amazing palette
I love the mirror in here I am very very
pleased that I got it so yeah definitely
a big fav of mine so another eyeshadow
palette that I wasn't sure if I want to
talk about but I'm hearing some
rumblings that this eyeshadow palette is
coming back in stock so I'm like you
know what I'm going to talk about it
because I absolutely love this palette I
have such a hard time not reaching for
it like I have to remind myself like
you've used that pallet the last three
days like you can wear something else
right but is from to face and it is the
sweet peach palette there was so many
issues around the release of this
palette and I just got upset with it
because I've been trying so hard to get
it this is what the inside looks like
I've been trying so hard to get this
palette I was trying online and they
have release dates kept getting switched
around and it caused it ended up causing
me to miss it because by the time I
realized the date have been changed it
was already sold out online and I
actually ended up going to my Alta like
the minute that it opened the day that
they had it in store and I bought one
and I was super excited about it but I'm
really glad that I ended up deciding to
get it because i think it's gorgeous so
it is sold out as of right now but it
has been said that it's supposed to be
coming back around the holiday time and
i think there's like another pallet
that's coming out with it maybe like a
highlight contour palette just the
highlight palette a bronzing palette I
don't know apparently something else is
coming out as well along like the sweet
peach line so I don't know we'll have to
see but I really do hope this comes back
in stock
I know so many people were not able to
get it and it really is amazing like if
you didn't get it the first time and it
does come back in stock like fingers
crossed that this really does happen I
hope that you get it because i think it
is gorgeous have a mirror net which i
like it does smell like peaches which I
enjoy when I open it up but just some of
these colors in here like honestly like
the lighter shades and the shimmer
shades are just gorgeous there's a
couple of like Matt Browns that I
absolutely cannot stay away from even if
i'm doing an eye look with a different
shimmer color a lot of times I reach for
puree and summer yum luscious and nectar
are gorgeous peaches and cream I use all
the time it's just a gorgeous palette so
hopefully this baby comes back in stock
because everybody needs it then my tenth
and final item is one that I love so
much i bought it because of all the hype
around it on youtube and honestly I'm so
completely grateful I did this should be
in sac if you want to buy it everything
I'm talking about will be linked below
but my final product that i love that as
high-end is the Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette ooh I love this palette i
bought this palette when i was still
very much a beginner and I had
absolutely no issues with it and I mean
I'm still very much a beginner in makeup
but even when I was just just starting
out this was one of my first higher-end
palettes that i bought are really even
eyeshadow palette in general that I
bought and I had no troubles with it
this is what the inside of it looks like
it does have a mirror as well over here
but I'm just going to flip it back make
it easier on all of us and this is what
the inside looks like it is so gorgeous
it's made up lip different quadrants
sometimes I do everything like out of
the quad sometimes I'm all over the
place but this is an all matte eyeshadow
palette and it is just phenomenal I
don't think there's a shade in here that
I haven't used and I don't think there's
a shade in here that I don't like like
I'm looking at it now and I don't think
there's one you know and I showed up
he'll there's always like at least one
if not two or three I can say it with
the two-faced sweet peach palette
there's at least four shades off the top
of my head that I know that I just don't
use I cannot say that
about this palette I've used all the
shadows I think they're all great they
are so blendable and when you're a
beginner and you don't really understand
the art of blending eyeshadow you need
shadows that are easy to blend and this
is it i'm telling you if you guys do not
have this palette yet in your collection
i highly recommend you get it whether
you're a beginner or a pro and makeup or
somewhere in between I think everybody
needs this I use it so often when I want
just like a bomb Matt look or even like
a smoky eye type of look this is what I
go for I think it's fantastic maybe
