today's video is going to be my top ten
favorite nude liquid lipsticks this was
a requested video from a few weeks back
I thought in my comment section and I
thought yeah I want to do that video
I love nude lips I love a liquid lips
and picking out ten it like it was hard
it wasn't quite as hard as I thought it
was I actually I don't know I was pretty
like cutthroat on this one I knew which
ones were my favorite and I knew which
ones I simply just liked and I feel like
I have a really good selection here of
ten of my favorite new DLitt lipstick of
course
my version of nude we have a lot of nude
pinks and a lot of nude Browns because
those are definitely what I gravitate
towards but they are all liquid
lipsticks we have high-end and also more
affordable in here as well and also
drugstores so I'm going to be showing
you each one I'll do a swatch on my hand
and then I'll also insert all the lip
swatches I haven't done them yet so
hopefully they go okay and my lips don't
completely want to fall off at the end
but I should also be inserting lip
swatches as well so you can see what
they all look like on me but I'm excited
to share my top ten favorite nude liquid
lipsticks if you are new here or you
haven't subscribed yet I hope that you
will consider hitting the subscribe
button before you leave I do post videos
at least four times a week to go via
live streaming every single Tuesday at 4
o'clock CST I think is when I will be
live-streaming every week and sometimes
I'll have even more extra videos thrown
in there so you'll get a lot of content
from me I love to talk about makeup so
if you haven't subscribed yet I hope
that you will before you go but why
don't we go ahead and get into my top 10
Matt's favorite nude liquid lipsticks
not going to go in any real particular
order here but this one is my drugstore
one this is from NYX it's one of their
soft matte lip creams this is in the
shade abu-dhabi I love the soft matte
lip creams because they're exactly what
they say they are super soft on the lips
they feel like a lip cream yet they dry
completely matte which I appreciate I do
find sometimes a little bit of transfer
with these liquid lipsticks but really
one of the best and I usually get them
at my CVS for like 5 dollars
I know they'll probably be a little bit
different compared to what drug stores
you're looking at but I'm telling you
that these are so good I picked out Abu
Dhabi because my London is basically
almost gone but London and Abu Dhabi are
my favorite news from the soft matte lip
creams
so this one is Abu Dhabi it's kind of
like a spicy cinnamon nud I would say
it's one of my favorites a super
comfortable formula really enjoy base so
if you haven't tried to mix a soft matte
lip cream yet I highly recommend so
another more affordable option i have is
from morphe I've been talking about our
liquid lipsticks a lot lately this one
is more of a pink pink nude this one is
in school girl I have really been
enjoying the morphia liquid lipsticks
I'm very impressed with them at these
are $12.99 I'm impressed with these
because it's a very long-lasting yet
comfortable formula it does dry
completely matte tiny tiny bit of
transfer again with these ones but
nothing too extreme especially after
you've let it dry down for a long time
if you love this color the pink looks so
pretty but it's so opaque on the lips
like with just one application I mean
you really cover your full lips it's
going to cover everything I remember
when I was using these I had a bruise on
my lip from when I had my wisdom tooth
removed and isolated numb mal and a
bruise on my lip and not all my
lipsticks are covering the bruise and
this one did I've just been so impressed
with these I've been really talking
about the more filled with lipsticks
because I feel like I don't hear a lot
of people talking about them but I
really love this and this one in school
girl is so pretty
so next up I have it too from Kat Von D
I couldn't take I have two from another
brand as well I was trying not to do
multiples from brands but sometimes the
colors just speak to me that much and
the formulas speak to me that much that
I just have to do it so cut the can't
find the everlasting a liquid lipstick
formula I definitely recommend the first
one I have is in bow and arrow and it is
a gorgeous nude brown I just love the
shade so much I love the formula it's
very long-lasting it's a very thinner
formula makes it a little bit more
comfortable for me I don't find these to
be super drying I know sometimes people
can say they think these are drying I
don't find them to be drying at all but
I love the nude brown look just bone
arrows one of my favorites and I love
the formula so much that I picked up
another one this one is in
Ludwig did I say it right that time I
know I said this wrong but this one
isn't Ludwig which is a nude pink and I
just am obsessed I think this was the
one that I bought in the support vib
sale and just instantly became obsessed
with it it is so gorgeous
so this one is Ludwig over here and
again just one of my favorites I love
the cat body formula I definitely
recommend it if you haven't checked it
out yet they are $20 at Sephora so they
are more expensive but they're really
really good and I would definitely get
more of them because I love these so
another one that I love this one might
be the most nuts this one is not going
to be the most expensive this would be
the second most expensive I have from my
collection but this is one of the
smashbox always on liquid lipsticks and
this one is in the shade stepping out
again I talk about this a lot I do have
a top 5 best and worst a liquid lipstick
so I definitely suggest checking that
out if you're interested
but the smashbox one is definitely in
there this is so long-lasting like so
incredibly long-lasting it is crazy to
me
there is the swatch of stepping out
again a beautiful nude brown I like I
truly can't get over how long this lasts
on the lips it's amazing the applicator
is really different too I haven't been
showing applicators but most of them are
the pretty standard Dell hood and this
is like more interesting like it's flat
on one end and then it's also really
pointy I like the applicator a lot I
think it makes for really easy
application of the liquid lipstick again
it looks so nice on the lips it's very
pigmented and again just incredibly
long-lasting if you want to go out and
know your lipsticks not going to move
I suggest the Smashbox oh is on liquid
lipsticks they are $24 so that's
definitely more expensive but they are
very very good so I do have to mention
this one even though I'm not a
particularly huge fan of this brand or
really even of all of the liquid
lipsticks that she's come out with but
if I'm talking about my favorite nude
liquid lipsticks like specifically I
have to mention this one because it
definitely is one of my favorites is
from Kylie cosmetics it is in a candy
kay it's one of her Matt was
lipsticks I love this I've talked about
this in the past up here not new to my
channel you've heard me say it
she just changes her formula way too
much to actually be able to know what to
expect from her liquid lipsticks I
bought this one first and was so
completely blown away by it so like
overwhelmed with happiness like I
thought it was fantastic and then I
purchased other format was it lipsticks
and they come up nowhere close to what
this is so unfortunately she's just
someone who's going to constantly change
her formula you're never going to know
what you're going to get and to me
that's just like super super
disappointing so I honestly don't know
if I would really recommend this one
because you don't know what formula
you're going to get but I'm talking
about my specific favorite news lips
this has to be included because I really
am still obsessed with this so this is
what the swatch of Kandy K looks like
we're going to get interesting swatching
up on my right hand because I can barely
do anything with my left but this one is
so long-lasting as well when I was in a
couple of weddings this was the liquid
lipstick that I was reaching for last
year because I knew it was going to stay
on and it's so pretty on the lips I love
this pink nude I think it looks so good
I'm just really disappointed that more
for liquid lipsticks aren't like this
because I would buy them if they were
this good but they're just really not I
think her matte liquid lipsticks weren't
for $17 if you buy them as singles
versus in the lip kit which I don't
think is a bad price at all I just wish
she was more consistent and maybe had
better customer service but definitely I
can't talk about my favorite nude lips
and not put in candy K because it is one
of my favorites the next one I have is
what is actually on my list right now
and I really wasn't going to include it
because it's my newest lipstick by far
I've only been able to wear it four
times but I've really because when I got
it I knew I was going to wear it to test
it out so I was really making sure that
I had it on was trying it out was
wearing it and like all of different
like elements and things like that so I
could get a solid review on it so I've
been wearing the crap out of it even
though I've only had it for a week I've
really been putting it to the test and
when I was trying to decide on what to
put in that final 10th spot like I had
other look at lipsticks that I liked but
this one was one that like instantly
became a favorite of mine
it is from dose of colors it isn't stone
I don't know if I said it but it's what
I'm wearing right now and I I get it I
get why people rave about Joseph's
colors they're liquid lipsticks I get
why people rave about stone I have
wanted this liquid lipstick for so long
just the colors is now in Alta and when
I thought I was like I have to get
stoned
I placed my order so fast when they came
online because I thought stone was going
to sell out because it was always sold
out on the dose colors website and I got
it and I'm so happy and isn't it so
freaking gorgeous like are you kidding
me said I just wanted to be up front
that I haven't had this for as long as
I've had some of the others but really I
mean I've been wearing it so often just
putting it to the test
and I have to say that I am just so
impressed and I love this color
so much there's this swatch on my hand
you can see it on my lips it's just
beautiful I like what lipsticks are $18
I will definitely get more I already
have a bunch in my like wishlist at Ulta
so yeah those are currently the lipstick
I have to give a thumbs up stone if you
love like the nude pink look thank you I
love this one it's you in here from huda
beauty this was another one rubs like
just pick one and I was like I can't
just take one but I love these so this
first one is a mini guy because I got it
in one of her lip contour sets that
comes with the lip liner and too many
liquid lipsticks this is in bombshell
and I love this again I find hutu beauty
lipsticks so long-lasting I wore this in
the most recent wedding that I was in as
a bridesmaid and I had no issues with
the longevity of it I did not touch up
from putting it on at 3:30 in the
afternoon until 2:00 a.m. or whenever I
took my lipstick office it was more like
3:30 but that's a whole other story
but I had no issues with this one and I
just think it is so gorgeous so there is
a swatch of bombshell a really beautiful
light kind of like rosy nude pink I
think it is gorgeous
I know a lot of you guys have said that
you've bought bombshell because you've
heard me talk 5 so much and that you
guys love it and makes me so so happy
but yeah this is such a favorite shade
the other one I have from huda beauty is
one of my more recent purchase
is as well I made a purchase from
Sephora not too long ago I don't even
know what it was that I was buying but I
had to throw it and knew who to liquid
lipstick because that really is how much
I love the formula it's kind of a very
like saying that watery formula but it
stays on so much it's a little bit
sticky for probably like I don't know
firstly 15 minutes that you have it on
but then I dress completely matte
there's no transfer I feel like it's
comfortable on the lips because like I
said like thinner and watery and makes
it not like completely dry out your lips
because I find those very dry knows what
lipsticks so so uncomfortable
I love the hooter formula she came out
with new nudes and I had to get one when
they finally dropped at Sephora this is
in the shade girlfriend I wore this when
I went to the Metallica Avenged
Sevenfold's concert the other night and
again I did not have to touch up at all
like so impressed with this formula I
love it don't you have trendsetter from
Makuta and this when I first put it on I
was like wow looks a lot like
trendsetter but translator is definitely
more of a darker brown nude and I feel
like it's going to be better for the
fall this one is definitely much lighter
I think it's described as like an
apricot soon as it is I kind of to agree
with it but I feel like for summer it's
going to be like the perfect light brown
nude shade on me
so this one is girlfriend the boodle
lipsticks are $20 for a little bit more
expensive but I think they are still
worth it I now have three shades I'm
probably going to get more the 10th and
final one I have I just love this guy
I've been raving about it to everyone
and everywhere that I can think of it's
from Marc Jacobs it's one of the Ella
Mark liquid lip creme so this isn't
supposed to be a traditional liquid
lipstick so it's me it's almost like I
don't know like a cross between like a
lip gloss a regular lipstick and a
liquid lipstick it's a very interesting
formula and it works this is the most
expensive lipstick I'm talking about at
$28 is Marc Jacobs beauty it is going to
be more expensive actually find out
during the support vib sale
I do recommend having some sort
discounts of $28 like to me there's just
a lot of money on a lipsticks but
honestly they are so good and they are
so worth it I will get more of these I
have my shade and truther bear and
I am just upset at the gorgeous color
it's definitely more like pink Rose nude
it's probably my darkest pink that I'm
showing if I look at the swatches on my
hand yeah it's definitely B it looks
really bright right now but it dries not
quite as bright so there is truth our
Barre right there but I just love how
comfortable it is it really almost does
feel like a lip gloss or a regular
liquid lipstick it doesn't drag down
completely matte and there is transfer
to it but it's still so long-lasting
like it's almost like it will like stain
your lips or something and and that
color is just going to stick around and
it's also easy to reapply it's not super
easy to reapply a liquid lipsticks
because I can just like gunk up on the
list you can reapply this one like to me
I know it's not the traditional liquid
lipstick formula but it's such a good
formula and it's super close to a liquid
lipstick I just had to put it in because
I've been talking about this everywhere
I absolutely love it I totally recommend
it I would not recommend a $28 lipstick
if I didn't truly love it but I really
do and this had to make in this video or
else I just it just wouldn't be right my
final favorite new liquid lipstick is
the Marc Jacobs a liquid lip creme and
truther bear and after that that is
going to do it for my 10 favorite nude
liquid lipsticks I guess that's going to
be everything for this video and my top
ten favorite nude lipstick there is a
close up of all of the swatches
hopefully I was also inserting swatches
of me putting on to look at lipstick so
you can see what they all look like on
my lips I really hope that you guys
