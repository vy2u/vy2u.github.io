to be doing my top 10 summer beauty
essentials I've been seeing a lot of
other people do this whether they have
like top 10 or they're just talking
about their summer essentials in general
I did try to narrow it down to just
beauty because when I started putting
other things in there like so in suit
cover ups and pads and Kindles and all
this crazy stuff my list was like super
long so I decided to cut it down to only
10 so these are my like summer must have
beauty essentials these are our products
that i find myself continually reaching
for like every day during the summer
when i'm getting ready to go out or
things like that so i really hope you
enjoy my top 10 and if you would like to
see the products that i chose please
keep watching ok so the first item and i
also feel like as i've been watching the
summer of central videos i feel like
this is the first item that everyone
mentions because you know sometimes
people need remind it to wear sunscreen
I have this little sample here of tart
guard 30 and I just like keep getting
samples when I order from Sephora they
always seem to be in the sample bag and
so I just keep asking for more because I
really do like it I should just buy the
full size product I don't know what I'm
waiting for but regardless of what's on
screen you use use sunscreen the number
one essential and everyone's lives
please don't go outside or lay in the
Sun or whatever it is you do without
sunscreen because the thought of what
the Sun and the UV rays can do to your
skin just like ooh let's be safe people
next item that I decided to choose is
the mac fix+ spray and this is like a
setting spray for your makeup and it can
also be like a primer for your makeup
too there's so many different makeup
sprays out there I also on one from
victoria secret but I I know that a lot
of different lines carry this like type
of makeup setting spray I know Smashbox
has one that's really popular right now
it's their primer water but I have the
mac fix+ and I feel like I've used it so
many times and I'm only this far down
but lately I've been finding myself in
the summer that I just spray it on my
face like in the middle of the day five
hot I go upstairs and I spray this on my
face when I go on vacation I bring this
and I spray it on my face throughout the
day like it just it not only is a
setting spray for your makeup but it
also kind of helps refresh you and give
you like that boost again especially for
the summer when it's super hot outside
having a setting spray a makeup spray
rehydrating spray I just think is a must
the next product that I want to talk
about is foundation and the one that I
chose to feature is the Maybelline fit
me how is the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless foundation and I have the
shade 2 30 which is natural buff this I
just am absolutely loving I feel like
I've mentioned it in so many of my
videos but I am just so impressed with
this drugstore foundation from the
Maybelline line so a little bit more
affordable than some of the higher-end
brands I know that I'm going somewhere
and I'm probably going to be gone all
day and I can't touch up my makeup I go
to and I've gone this is my second
bottle of this now and I also do have
the regular line as well but especially
for the summer this matte and poreless
it really does keep you Matt it really
does make you boil it's like I feel like
it does what it says and it just stays
on my makeup doesn't move I'm just so
impressed with this there's several days
where you know we're so busy in the
summer me my husband are both in our 20s
and we have a lot of weddings and
showers bachelorette parties group
vacations like there are so many
weekends where we're gone and when we
leave the house in the morning we're not
coming home until you know 2 a.m. or
whatever and so this is the foundation
that I use because I know without a
doubt that it's going to stay on all day
it also really helps because there is no
SPF in it so I don't have to worry about
when I take pictures then I'm going to
have that like white flash white cast
over my face it just makes me look
really natural and pictures and I also
do want to mention BB creams and this
bottle I don't know why I grab this one
I dit today this is what I'm wearing
today is the Maybelline Dream fresh BB
cream but like look how dirty this is
like I literally have three bottles of
the Maybelline Dream fresh BB cream and
then I also have two from all my because
I like BB creams
BB creams for days where you know maybe
I'm not going to be gone all day or I'm
not really doing much but I still kind
of want to even out my skin tone and you
know look a little bit healthier so I
will use a BB cream this one from
Maybelline it says it's an eight and one
beauty balm skin protector it does have
SPF in it which is good if you're going
to be outside and you want to protect
your skin but it also you don't have to
use a primer like when I would use the
Maybelline foundation I would use a
primer beforehand and then put the
foundation on and I understand in the
summer you know if you're just going to
go sit outside or hang out with your
friends at a house like you don't need a
full face of makeup on so BB cream is a
really good alternative to a foundation
but for this one it says it blurs
imperfections enhances brightens adjust
to skin tone smooth hydrates it is SPF
30 and there's zero percent oils and
other heavy ingredients so it's not
going to feel heavy on your face it's
going to protect your skin and it's also
just going to give you a little bit of a
healthy glow I know that Maybelline also
did just come out with a BB cream that
has like a bronze in it as well and I'm
really curious to pick it up if anyone
has tried it out please let me know cuz
I haven't really seen it mentioned a lot
yet so I've been kind of on the fence
about getting it the next item I want to
talk about is like my favorite
highlighter right now I'm filming this
before i'm getting my Sephora order and
i have ordered the becca highlighter
champagne pop from Jaclyn hill I have
been seeing this everywhere I had my
iono because i'm a big jaclyn hill fan i
watch all of her videos ball around
snapchat I think she's so much fun to
watch and honestly to look up to as a
new youtuber no I saw the highlighter
come out and I was like I really want
that highlighter it just blew up on
YouTube everyone has it everyone says
really good things about it so when I
put in my latest sephora order I got it
but it's not here yet so for right now
I'm going to need to shout out the
mary-lou manizer and this is from the
bomb my favorite highlighter right now
and it's just kind of frosty like can
you see that I don't know if you guys
can see that okay with all my lights but
it is my favorite highlighter it's the 1
i'm always reaching towards i do have a
few other highlighters and my collection
some higher-end and some more drug store
I got this one on amazon and i think
this one is definitely more on the
Affordable side I just love it brings
such a pretty glow to the face phone it
works really well for me it's not too
dark it's not too light it's kind of
moron like the white frosty side of the
highlight but I love it and for the
summer especially if you're going for
just like a very you know casual summer
look you don't have a lot of foundation
on you don't have a lot of eye makeup on
one way to like fake that glow is to use
a highlighter and i have found myself
doing that quite a bit throughout these
summer days so my favorite highlighter
at the moment but don't worry i will
have a full video review of the
champagne pop coming soon okay so we are
halfway through so to keep it moving and
to go back to skincare I'm a huge
supporter of safe tanning and sunless
tanning the thought of tanning beds just
totally freaked me out I used to tan all
the time like I remember when tanning
became really popular in high school and
the thing to do was to go lay in the
tanning bed until you got burnt and then
you're like yeah high five good job way
to go burn your skin I mean it's so
crazy to think about in my college days
not only would I you know do the tanning
bed thing but also my friends and I
would lay out in the Sun and put like
the baby oil on us the tanning oil on oh
so we could get Tanner faster and I'm
just like you I'm so freaked out about
it I'm just you know no I'm so over that
and it's really awesome to see in these
YouTube videos how everyone is
supporting the sunless tanning because
skin cancer is just it's no joke I know
several people who have been affected by
it and does that we just gotta stop
dating because it's just not good for
you inning is getting really popular and
recently I picked up these tan towels I
picked him up from my sister-in-law owns
a boutique called top off clothing and I
will incur sir below I don't know if you
can get these online
her website or not but she does have a
website but they're just the tan towel
it's a self-tan tell let and for a face
and body I got the one for medium to
dark skin tones and I've only used it
once so I don't want to say that I'm
like totally endorsing this tan towel
not used it enough to be able to give it
a full review but what I'm trying to say
is please give the tanning beds the
summer please skip like putting the baby
oil painting oil on your body and going
and laying outside and burning yourself
really if you can look into the sunless
tanning you know it might not be super
expensive this box was twenty seven
dollars and it comes with ten towels and
I used to so far for my full body my
legs my torso my chest my arms my face
my back you know I I used to and I tan
to my whole body a lot of times i think
i will only need to use one towel
because my upper body gets very tan very
quickly because when i walk my dog i'm
outside and i feel like my shoulders
just get tan even though when i do walk
outside i literally have sunscreen on my
desk because when we go outside to walk
i take my little thing of sunscreen and
I put it on my shoulders or whatever is
covered i'm not a huge shorts person so
a lot of times i wear capris even when
it's really how about just because i
don't like walking around in shorts so
my legs never really get very tan and
then I just kind of look at I got a tan
upper half in a not so tan lower half so
I think I might only need to honestly
use these on my legs in the future so I
would only need to use one towel so
that's twenty seven dollars for ten
towels and two tan in a tanning bed or
to use like the spray tan at tanning
salons is so expensive the membership
for the sunless tanning it was called
like the versus spa or something like
that and I would go in and get a spray
tan every two weeks and now I'm like how
the heck did I afford that that stuff is
expensive this so far the one
application that I've done it was super
easy you just take the towel out you rub
it in circular motions all over where
you want to be tan and
boom and then after like four to six
hours you shower which I did the very
next day I recorded a video and I'm like
whoa you guys I am super tan I you know
I just stopped and and I'm trying this
out but it works I felt like I was tan
but again before I really am like these
are the ones you have to get i do want
to try it out more and i plan on doing a
full review and possibly even like demo
video of it but there are so many good
self tanners out there right now and I
see a lot of other youtubers talking
about it I think loving tan is a really
popular 1 million dollar tan san Tropez
has stuff out there vita liberata tan i
don't know if i'm saying that right but
there is so many companies out there and
they range from you no more affordable
to more expensive but my advice for you
this summer is please don't hurt your
skin and just look into some most
handing and see if something would work
for you next item i want to talk about
is I feel like not only is it a summer
essential but it's just like my makeup
essential all around and that is a
beauty blender but i have to tell you
guys a story so when i first bought my
first Beauty Blender it was about a year
and a half ago and i believe i bought it
at target now there is beauty blender is
a brand you can buy the Beauty Blender
they have their own brand but then
there's a lot of spin-offs of beauty
blenders so they come from different
companies and you know things like that
my first one that i bought it was from
target so it wasn't at the actual beauty
blender and i thought it worked just
fine what it is it's like this little
sponge and you get it wet and it's for
blending out your makeup a lot of times
I use it for my under-eye concealer some
people use it for their full foundation
because it really does give like almost
like an airbrushed more natural look to
your skin so these have just blown up I
mean everyone uses beauty blenders it's
crazy but so my first Beauty Blender
even though it wasn't the Beauty Blender
it worked fine for me had it for about a
year and a half and I was like okay you
know I think I really need to replace
the Beauty Blender I think it's like
getting down there on uses and i was at
walgreens other day and they were having
a sale on their beauty blenders that
they sell at the walgreens and
so I thought I would buy it oh my gosh
you guys I hate this I hate this thing
it is hard like when I took it out of
the package I was like this can't be
good it is so hard usually when you get
them wet it's like a sponge so the
sponge gets really really big this
doesn't move this is the size it remains
even after i get it wet it does not
blend out I mean no so I think I'm
actually going to get the actual Beauty
Blender next time I put in an aura I
don't know if they have them at like
Sephora or Alta now they don't have them
at Ulta I know they have real techniques
which are supposed to be just as good at
all does so maybe I'll go that route but
i think i'm going to go the actual
Beautyblender route and then kind of
compare it to the off-brand first Beauty
Blender that I have because this one is
just terrible I feel like I can't even
use it but that's my story but the
actual Beauty Blender if you get a good
one and you get the good sponge they
helped so much with your makeup and
especially in the summer where you want
to look like you're not wearing a lot of
makeup I feel like the Beauty Blender
really helps make you have that more
like natural look even when you do wear
foundation so beauty blender is on my
list just not whatever the walgreens off
brand is no the next item that I chose
as my favorite it's because like the
sunscreen I have it right next to my
desk and I put it on so many times a day
and it's from the perfectly posh line
and it's called Opie tchas and it's a
super fabulous sugar scrub and basically
it's just it's a sugar scrub for your
lips and it looks I don't know if you'll
be able to see it but it looks like that
on the inside it smells like peaches and
it's just got like that fine grain sugar
inside so it actually is supposed to
like kind of be a lip plumper for your
lips you're supposed to put it on and
it'll kind of like make your lips a
little bit fuller and then put your
lipstick on over it or it's supposed to
help like exfoliate your lips and get
all that dead skin off and that's
personally what I use it for and I
actually love it I love the way it
smells you know after you rub your lips
so many times the sugar dissolves and
then here just left with like a peachy
lip gloss and I love
I honestly I probably put it on at least
five times a day sometimes more I just I
love it so this is from perfectly posh
and it's Oh peaches and I can leave
links to that below only two more
products left I hope you're sticking
with me but the next one that I want to
talk about is just an eyeliner but it's
a nude or like a beige eyeliner the 1i
have is from Rimmel it says the Serb
waterproof eye definer in exaggerated so
this is just for your waterline and why
I think it's really good for summer is
because instead of using black or like
dark blue or something like that like I
have dark blue on today instead of using
that in your water line which can kind
of make your look just a little bit
harsher if you use something like a nude
pencil now it only does it like I think
it's really cool that this is called
exaggerated because it kind of does
exaggerate your eyes and makes them
bigger and make some pop more and i just
think that it looks really pretty when
you have nude in your waterline and then
you just kind of smudge out you know
maybe like a dark brown eyeshadow or i
did a look the other day where i had
gold on my eyelids I had glamorous from
makeup geek all over my eyelids and then
I also smudged it oh my waterline and
had this in the waterline and I just
thought it looked so pretty so it can
kind of make your look a little bit
softer which i think is really good for
summer is one that honestly I bought it
so I could have a nude eyeliner in my
collection and then didn't really use it
a whole lot and then all of a sudden
summer came and I was like yes I love
this so I wear this a lot my very last
item to talk about is actually a dry
shampoo I just did my hair care video
recently which I can link below and in
it I'm like oh I need to tell you about
my dry shampoo and then I totally forgot
to talk about it but I have the kenra
dry shampoo and it just comes in like
this little you know silver camera
bottle but I absolutely love it because
I did mention in my hair care video that
I only wash my hair like twice a week so
a lot of times when I'm get
to like day three hair I'll use my dry
shampoo not only to kind of take away
some of the oils that build up but also
because it just kind of gives you hear a
little bit more volume and fullness and
I really like that and you know say that
you're going somewhere you're going on a
vacation like we just went camping
recently we went up to Lake Okoboji and
did camping for 3 days and I was like I
don't know what the shower situation is
going to be like you know what what
should i bring for hair care products
and I just brought my dry shampoo and I
thought it worked really great that I
just I absolutely love even if I'm not
traveling if I'm just staying at home
i'm on my day 3 hair or whatever that it
is i'll just use this and i really love
it i love having dry shampoo in my
collection and honestly cameras probably
my favorite one that I've tried so far
so those are my top 10 summer beauty
essentials for you I have some makeup in
there and have some tools in there I
have some hair care in there and I
really hope you enjoyed this video I
hope it helped you out if you're looking
to still grab a few summer items left

hearing people say like Oh summer's
