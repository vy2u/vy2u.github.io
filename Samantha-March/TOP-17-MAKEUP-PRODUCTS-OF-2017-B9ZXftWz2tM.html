today's video I'm so excited to do
because this is going to be my top 17
makeup products of the year of 2017 this
is going to be a little preview for my
best of beauty 2017 a video that will be
coming in December so if you're
interested in seeing as some of my
absolute favorite products and that I've
tried throughout the year I'm gonna go
ahead and get started so this video was
actually a recommendation I screenshot
of this so I could have the screen shot
into this video and then I promptly I
think I delete it screenshot because I
always have to be deleted my photos on
my phone but I'm fairly sure that Carol
asked if I would do my top 17 of 2017
video so big thank you to her for
suggesting this video for me I'm so
excited to do the best of beauty 2017
video I did do one last year it's just a
giant monthly favorites video basically
but you're going through the entire year
all of your favorite beauty products I
did it for the first time last year and
I absolutely loved it and I'm already
working on my list for 2017 more today
is a little preview of that much longer
video I'm picking out my favorite
seventeen products throughout the year
so first up I do want to start with some
foundations I have a three products here
that I want to give a special shout out
to the first one is a from Urban Decay
and this is the one and done the hybrid
complexion Perfector okay so this was
new to me in the year of 2017 I did
receive a PR package from Urban Decay
with this in it and when I showed it on
my snapchat everybody was saying oh my
gosh I love that one and done and I'm
like what do you mean I haven't even
heard of this I've been what who uses
this product and then I tried it I was
like this is the bomb so it has a little
pump right here that you pump it out
with I'm in the shade medium really is a
fantastic product at like blurring out
the skin and it says reading of the
description from Sephora it says that
you know it blurs the imperfections and
you know just makes the skin look better
but it doesn't look overdone and I would
absolutely agree with that even when I
feel like I've used too much product
like I did one extra plump too many and
I'm like oh no it's never looked cakey
or like I'm wearing a foundation on the
skin it's really lightweight
I have reached for this so so often it
does have an SPF 20 I was using this
like crazy in the summer and he's
I was traveling it was always coming
with me is $36 which I feel like it's
pretty expensive for kind of like a
hybrid type of foundation but honestly I
think that it's worth it
I would definitely be repurchasing more
of these for myself when I run out of
them because this was an absolute
favorite so and next up I want to talk
about this foundation from Lancome this
is the attendee dual ultra wear
foundation I do have two different
shades here these were sent to me from
Lancome and I'm really excited to have
the two different shades because I'm
above done with this one and about to
move over into my winter shade this one
is 320 bisque warm and then at my cooler
shade is 320 bisque cool cooler shade
I'm at like winter shade but you know
what I mean
cooler weather shade so those are the
two that I have these are $47 I also
recommended these in my Sephora VIP
recommendations video because it truly
became one of my favorite foundations
from the year this is one that I reach
for so often I love being medium to full
coverage on this I love the way it looks
on the skin I love how healthy it makes
my skin look without again without
looking too much too overdone too cakey
too much foundation this really has just
become an absolute a favorite of mine
and then I do have a drugstore
foundation that I would recommend as
well this is the number 7s a perfect
foundation you probably see me talking
about this a lot throughout my videos
the past couple of months and since I
was able to try this and it really did
become a favorite foundation of mine I
did get these sent to me from number 7
as well and once again I have kind of my
Tanner summer shade and then my a little
bit lighter winter shade so that is in a
cool beige and then also in warm beige I
have just been really enjoying this
foundation I'm a little concerned though
because number seven can be found at
Ulta and before I was making this video
I was trying to find it on the Ulta
website so I can list the price and it
says that this item is no longer
available at Ulta so I don't know what
that means but that has me a little
concerned I hope number seven is going
to be sticking around at Ulta because
really I have more products from number
seven to talk about in this video they
became a favorite brand in general of
mine in 2017 this is the first time I
was trying number seven and I just found
so many items from them that I love so
much but definitely the stay perfect
foundation such a good foundation if
you're looking for something a little
bit on the more
portable side it still gives a really
solid medium coverage it's super easy to
blend out on the skin and it's also very
long-lasting honestly it reminds me a
bit of the lancome a-- attendee dole
foundation i think that one has a little
bit longer wear and a little bit more
coverage to it but this is a really nice
affordable option i did find it on the
target website at about $13 so that's
kind of the price range that you'll be
looking in i have seen number seven in
like walgreens and other drugstores like
that i hope that they're going to
continue to be around at Ulta but I will
find any links I can down below and link
to the state perfect foundation up from
number seven I fell in love with a new
concealer in the year of 2017 and no it
is not shave tape it is a from Urban
Decay and this is the Naked skin at
concealer I feel like I have heard so
many people say amazing things about
this concealer and I was just always
kind of like I don't know you haven't
quite sold me yet and I sincerely hope
that I can sell at least one of you on
this concealer if you haven't tried it
yet because it really became my new
go-to this is a pricey little concealer
at $29 so that's expensive but I do feel
like it's worth it and I would
definitely be repurchasing this one my
shade is in light neutral I have just
been loving this one I know a lot of
people have given it rave reviews and
I'm now here to contribute my rave
review to the Urban Decay Naked skin a
favorite bronzer that I found in 2017 is
again at from number 7 and this is
called their match-made bronzer so this
is the one that I have and mine is in
the shade caramel I really like the
packaging on it and it does have a nice
mirror which i think is fantastic but I
instantly instantly fell in love with
this bronzer I think it is so beautiful
it's so natural looking on the skin it's
so easy to blend out the caramel is
totally my shade but I know they have
other shades as well once again does sub
searching on the alto website it looks
like the only thing I confirm from
number seven on the Ulta website now is
their skin care products which I love
number seven skin care I think I love
number seven skin care more than I love
their makeup actually but that still has
me a little bit concerned but again you
can find this at like Target and
Walgreens places like that the bronzer
on the target website is listed at about
I felt like it was maybe around like
seven or eight on the alto website but
this is definitely a fantastic bronzer
it's really easy to travel with - it has
that nice mirror I would highly
recommend it checking out number seven
but also if you are a lover of bronzer
like me and check out the match my
bronzer so moving on I do have a couple
of face palettes that I would say were
some of my favorites in 2017 the first
one is the vanity palette from Pierre
they did come out with two of them and I
do have both but I really love
gold-digger for a face palette because I
love the bronzer and the blush and the
highlight in here so so much I take this
one traveling with me all the time - and
I love that you can actually kind of pop
it up and you have your own little like
traveling vanity a little bear with you
I love that but the bronzer blush and
highlight are absolutely gorgeous and
then it does also have four eyeshadows
this one is $36 I think it's totally
worth it I have recommended this over
and over and over again
so I love this one from Pierre and then
the other one that I would recommend is
the clay play palette from Tarte
cosmetics so this one has a similar you
know style to the Pier one where you
have eyeshadows and then face colors as
well except I use this one as a contour
this one is a bronzer this one is a
little bit too deep for me I have used
it on my eyes but I really only use
those two where is what the pure one you
also have a blush and eye highlight but
then in this one you also have a lot
more eyeshadow shades this one is $46
you get a very large mirror with it this
one is also very travel friendly and I
take this one a lot with me - the eye
shadows kind of remind me of the Kat Von
D shade + light eyeshadow palette which
is a favorite of mine they're all very
neutral and very matte eyeshadows but I
have gotten a ton of use out of the clay
plate as well definitely a favorite in
2017 I really enjoy face palette so I
have one more here to recommend this is
from a Kevin Daquan this is the
sculpting and contour book it is $65 but
you do get quite a variety of different
products some cream and some powder in
particular I absolutely love the Kevyn
Aucoin sculpting powder I think it is
fantastic I use it so often and I would
HIGHLY highly recommend it if you buy
that one on its own it's $44 and you can
get this entire book with a little
mirror here for 65 which I don't think
is a bad price you have the sculpting
cream here and then you also have the
candlelight cream and then also the
candlelight highlight which i think is
really beautiful and
you also do get before eyeshadows in
here too but again the Kevyn Aucoin and
the sculpting powder I just think is so
good he also has the making faces beauty
book out which is $75 and you get even
more variety of products but you also
get the sculpting powder in there as
well so I would recommend both of those
but I really have been loving this book
and it was always sitting out because
I'm rooting a forward so often so I'd
highly recommend this one to know that
I'm gonna have a lot of eyeshadow
palettes to talk about in my best of
beauty 2017 from a dose of colors and
this is the marvelous moths eyeshadow
palette I think this was my first
purchase from the dose of colors brand
got this on the Ulta website and it is
$32 and inside you get a 5 different
shades all in the moth tone family you
also get a mirror and you also do get a
nice brush which I do actually enjoy the
brush on this one
I love reaching out for this eyeshadow
palette this is another one that went
traveling with me quite a bit I was so
impressed with these eyeshadows that
from dose of colors definitely a great
purchase definitely a favorite in the
year 2017 palette that absolutely stole
me from the moment I got it is the
morphe brushes and that Jaclyn hill eyes
shadow palette I just instantly became
obsessed with this palette I would
highly recommend this palette it is $38
which is pretty pricey especially for
morphe because they're 35 eyeshadow
palettes are typically more in the $20
range but they are also now available at
also you can use your points on there
and you know you can use Ebates now we
also use like the coupon codes and stuff
that alpha has which i think is really
awesome but this eyeshadow palette is
just one that i have continually
continually reached for I just feel like
the amount of looks that you can create
with this palette is like never-ending I
mean I have done so many so many
different looks with this palette I
reach for it all the time but there's
still so many more looks that I want to
create I'm not someone who is
artistically creative I'm not a makeup
artist or anything like that and
sometimes I have difficulties coming up
with looks because I just don't have
that kind of like pink moment every time
I look at an eyeshadow palette but no
matter what whenever I open this palette
I get excited I can see a look I can see
a shadow that I want to play with so I
found a somewhat lashes in 2017 that I
have been wearing like crazy I've been
recommending like crazy if you were down
new to my channel you know that I am
about the pur cosmetics lashes Wow why
do I love these why do I wear them all
the time I always look at my makeup in
the description box that you are
typically seeing a lot of pure lashes in
there over on my Instagram I'm always
linking what makeup I'm wearing you see
the pure lashes so much these ones are
in the shade diva which is one of my
absolute favorite just very wispy
beautiful lashes I have bombshell on my
eyes right now and these poor lashes
like if they look a little wonky it's
because they just need to be thrown away
I've worn them so many times I have
cleaned them twice but when I went to
purchase a new pair on the Ulta website
just last week they were sold out so
just wait for those to come back so I
can get a new pair of bombshell lashes
and throw these ones away because they
really just need to be tossed they're
only 14 dollars which I don't think is a
bad price for lashes again you can get
them on the Ulta website you can use
your points you can use the coupons my
favorite styles are definitely diva and
bombshell those are the ones that I
continually emerging for from here but I
love these they're so easy to work what
the band is so easy to work with you do
not need liner with these lashes I do
not have liner on today I don't need to
our liner with the diva lashes just my
absolute like standouts from 2017 and
the lash department I would highly
recommend them along with lashes I have
a tool here to talk about this might be
a little bit random but for sure this
would go on my best beauty video these
are from a Tarte cosmetics they are the
lash applicator I believe these are $14
on the alte website and these have just
really been a game changer for me when
it comes to my lashes I used to apply my
lashes with either my fingers or my
regular tweezers which my regular
tweezers are really sharp I've actually
like snipped my lashes before I really
enjoyed these ones a from Tarte I
recommend them all the time especially
when people are asking for like lash
application tips I would suggest trying
this one from Tarte I think you can get
it on the Sephora website too
so maybe if you're still looking for VIP
recommendations I think there at Sephora
if they are I will have them linked down
below but I like them but because they
have this like flat edge right here that
just makes it easy to hold the entire
lash versus a regular tweezer where
you're really kind of just holding the
lash by the center you can put that an
entire lash in there and just don't
easily pop it on to your eye I will not
put my
as on without these these come
travelling with me everywhere I tried a
new accompany for makeup brushes in the
year of 2017 and I would highly
recommend them I know I put these
brushes in favourites videos and the
brand is royal and langnickel and these
are the motor brushes these ones in
particular are the Mota metallic brushes
and these are just some of my absolute
favorites like these are ones that I use
on almost a daily basis this one I use
to just apply like my white base to my
eyes my eyeshadow base after I've
applied an eyelid primer I just love
this brush I use it nearly every single
day but I also really enjoyed these
brushes this one is called I think it's
called the contour brush you have the
contour brush it's what I use for
contour this one is called the buffer
brush and this is what I use for bronzer
you've probably seen me use these a lot
especially my Instagram tutorials I'm
typically constantly using these ones as
well I did try the mode of prismatic
brushes as well this year and I would
recommend those too but I think the
metallics are actually like my
favourites I know these can be found at
Walmart anywhere that I can find them I
will have them linked down below but
really just some of my new favorite
brushes are really excited to find this
brand know that I'm gonna have quite a
few highlights to recommend in my best
of beauty video but the one I want to
share in my little preview teaser video
today is a from Lancome these are one of
the dual finish highlighters and my
faith is in a sparkling peach or
sparkling Pesche I'm not really sure
this is a gorgeous highlight and this is
a highlight that I really wanted to
include in this one because I actually
passed over it I put it in a will I'd
buy a video and I was like nope I'm not
really interested it's 39:54 a worn the
highlight which is definitely a pretty
darn expensive it does have really nice
packaging though you're getting a lot of
product and you are getting a mirror
which is great but wow ho-hold wow are
these good highlights and it's
interesting because I feel like I'm
seeing them more and more like I'm
seeing other beauty bloggers talk about
them I've been seeing these in favorites
videos as well like a lot of people are
starting to realize this is actually a
really freaking beautiful highlight I
love this shade that I picked up I
honestly want to pick up another one
because these are so absolutely gorgeous
but and then I'm going to finish up with
lip products this might be the biggest
section of my festered community video
but I have three different lip of
products here that I would recommend the
first is the hooter boo
the liquid lipsticks I have full-size I
have mini size I just placed another
order with the support VIP so that's
coming to me I'm super excited about it
the full sizes are $20 she has different
sets with minis and them the said I just
purchased had four minis for $33 which
we don't think is a bad price at all but
this is definitely one of my favorite
formulas I'm honestly not sure if I
found her at the end of 2016 or if it
was 2017 when I found her lip products
but I have been recommending them ever
since I have found them some of my
favorite shades are in a girlfriend and
then also a trend Center I also have
bombshell which I can't find it's
probably buried in the bottom of my
clutch because I always have it on me
but those are some of my favorite shades
another liquid lipstick a formula that I
found in at 2017 for the first time
after hearing it recommended so often I
finally did it
these are the Ophir cosmetics a liquid
lipsticks I actually just featured them
in my makeup monthly in yesterday's
video I believe it was I'll link it down
below talking about how these are some
of my favorite liquid lipsticks they
truly are they are $17 you can friends
on the Oprah website and also in Ulta
and they just really became some of my
favorites these are only a few that I
have I actually have more of them but
some of my favorite shades are in nude
potion which was in a collab with
nikkietutorials Manila is like one of my
favorite nudes just like ever across all
of my liquid lipsticks Manila is a
favorite Manhattan is the shade that I
was wearing in yesterday's makeup
monthly video and it's gorgeous and
Atlantic City is the one that I was
wearing in my eyeshadow collection video
it's a gorgeous true red but again one
of my favorite liquid lipsticks formulas
if you haven't checked out all for us a
liquid lips yet you should do it and
then another new a favorite lipstick a
formula these are not too liquid
lipsticks I'm a big fan of liquid
lipsticks I'm trying to up range out
more and do it the whole glossy trend
that everyone's talking about but I do
have some favorite more creamier type of
lipsticks to talk about these are from
milk makeup and these are just called
their lip colors and there are $22 on
the Sephora website I have really been
enjoying these I know I put them in a
favorites video pretty recently I've
been wearing them a so often I have a
quite a range of colors these first sent
to me from milk makeup and I did the
really selfish thing and I kept most of
the colors for myself because I want it
like every shade in this formula because
it's one of my favorites but I did put
some in a giveaway I did I did pass them
along my favorite
shade is a cream which I had to dig this
one out of my clutch as well because it
always comes with me I love cream it's a
fantastic nude and then some of my other
other favorites are in whyphy wavy and
then girl I will insert some swatch
clips so you can see all of them but
those are some of my favorite shade from
the milk look at products and again I
just really enjoyed this formula it's a
matte lipstick but it doesn't feel like
super matte or super drying it's pretty
creamy to apply which most matte
lipsticks are not you kind of have to
kind of like tug and pull out your lips
when you're applying matte lipsticks did
not find that with these and I feel like
they were very long-lasting as well so
if you haven't checked out the milk and
makeup lipsticks yet these were one of
my favorites from the year okay so that
is going to do it for my top seventeen
products of a 2017 I really hope that
you enjoyed seeing this little teaser
video of my best of beauty 2017 and that
will be coming next month I'm so excited
to share that video as well let me know
in the comments down below some of your
favorite products of 2017 I would love

video I hope that you will give it a
thumbs up I hope that you will also
