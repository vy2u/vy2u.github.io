today's video is going to be all about
my favorite lipstick shades focusing on
nude and pink lipsticks I've been
getting so many video requests in to
make a video on my favorite nude
lipsticks but at the same time also my
favorite pink lipsticks so I thought I
would combine the two together I have my
top 20 lipstick shades we're gonna be
talking regular lipstick formula a
liquid lipstick formula drugstore high
end it's all measured in here together
I'm just gonna bring you my twenty
favorite nude and pink lipstick shades
so if you are ready to see them why
don't we go ahead and get started
feel like a completely different person
today my hair is up I have earrings in
and I ripped off on my fig nails last
night that's a little dramatic I safely
removed my acrylics last night but I
still feel like a completely different
person at least we're talking about
lipstick and we're talking about nudes
and Pink's two of my favorite things
because I'm feeling all kinds of weird
right now I need something to keep me
grounded and remind me of who I am but
I'm gonna do is a focus on the regular
lipstick formula first mostly because I
am also going to be sharing a lip
swatches and it's easier to remove
regular lipstick versus a liquid
lipsticks I'm gonna do all those first
and then swatch out the liquid lipsticks
so I'll have swatches on my arm to
insert in here and I will also insert
what the lipstick actually looks like on
me if that makes sense so if you aren't
ready first up I'm gonna share what I am
wearing it today and that is from
Maybelline and this is a truffle tease
truffle tease is one of my G's I love
this lipstick so freakin much I'm
wearing it right now it is such a nice
creamy nude Maybelline lipsticks have
been some of my favorite for the longest
time when I first started kind of
building my lipstick collection it was
full of Maybelline these are one of my
favorite lipsticks at the drugstore it
depends on where you go but typically
they're around like the seven or eight
dollar mark and I just think they are
fantastic truffle tease has been one of
my absolute favorite go-to nudes for the
longest time I wear it so often it's so
easy to apply it or get makes my lips
look really good and it's just been one
of my staple lipsticks for the longest
time so I love it truffle tease also
from Maybelline again you're gonna see
like repeat brands in here as well I
just wanted to
show you my favorite shades all of these
are also a favorite formula of mine of
course but I'm really just focusing on
the pink and the nude shades but you
will see some repeat brands in here as
well and Maybelline is definitely want
to go because like I said I just love
their lipsticks and I think that they're
so affordable especially like when I get
questions of you know I'm starting to
build my collection or maybe I don't
want to spend a ton of money but I
really want a nice good non liquid
lipstick I feel like I get that a lot
was a good nun liquid lipsticks I know
liquid lipsticks are not for everybody
but I always suggest Maybelline of
course everything will be linked down
below this is more of a matte finish but
it's also another nude and I absolutely
love it
so here is what a clay crush looks like
and again it's such a beautiful nude a
little bit on the darker side but it
also does have a matte finish to it but
I like it because it's also not it's not
drying at all I can still easily rub my
lips together with it where some matte
lipsticks you really can't rub your lips
together this one I can and because
these are more regular lipsticks even
the matte one they're not the longest
lasting lipstick but they're super easy
to reapply if I want a good nude but I
still want a matte lip but I don't want
to go with the full-on a liquid lipstick
route a lot of times I'm reaching for
clay crush I've had this in my
collection jar very a long time I
remember buying this because I have a
crush on Clay Matthews from the Green
Bay Packers have for several years now
that's how I actually ended up at
picking up this color from the drugstore
the name sold me on it but hey it's
still one of my favorites still one of
my favorites Thank You clay the next one
that I have here is from mac cosmetics
if you guys are watching my videos
lately you know what I'm about to say
let's all say it together chat room
style age sex location I love this new
trick I love this nude lipstick the name
definitely cracks me up but I love this
one this was in the Nicki Minaj
collaboration I did actually get sent to
all of those lipsticks from Mac which
was so exciting just opening a package
of nude lipsticks was like the last four
Christmases of mine rolled into one day
oh my gosh it was so exciting and I
tried out this one and it's beautiful
this one actually reminds me a lot of
truffle tease from Maybelline maybe just
a smidge darker but it reminds me a lot
of Maybelline and even though formula
they do kind of seem similar to one
another I think Mack is just a little
bit more on the drier side but they also
last longer on me so there's that but
really do enjoy the Makah lipstick
formula and this is hands-down my
favorite MAC lipstick especially right
now I just think age sex location is
absolutely beautiful one of my staple
news at the moment next up here I have
from Kat Von D and this is one of the
studded kiss lipsticks in the Lovecraft
this is a little sample guy it came and
run the Sephora give me some nude lip
stats I know that she has recently kind
of like reformulate at this one and
they're now called the studded lip creme
formula I think it is and there are $19
for the full-size at Sephora and such I
do want to try out that formula to see
if it's similar to this one because I
really really really like this formula I
have a couple other ones from her as
well they are more like darker tones but
this one is a really nice pink kind of
the next three that I'm going to show
you I feel like are all really similar
to one another shade wise but I really
really like this pink it's super creamy
as very pigmented and it's very opaque
on the lips I really enjoyed this one
and I find myself reaching for it a ton
I do also like Kat Von D's liquid
lipsticks which I had tried first and
then I got this one in the Sephora set
and I was like I don't know because I
tend to lean more towards liquid
lipsticks especially when going out but
I was like I you know I'll give it a try
and then a I loved the color I thought
it was a beautiful pink but then B I
love the formula on this one so I'll be
curious have you guys tried the new
formula I definitely want to pick it up
and see what I think of it but a
lovecraft is one of my favorite Pink's
next up I have this one from Marc Jacobs
this is the Lamarck a lip creme in slow
burn again it's a mini size it's from
one of the support give me some nude lip
sets this is the reason why I love these
nude sets so much I have another one as
well that came in those lipstick sets
and I feel like I find really good
lipsticks for such a good value and even
though these are smaller lipsticks you
still get a ton of uses out of them
especially if you're someone like me and
you have a big lipstick collection and
it's like you know you don't wear 50
lipsticks in one day giving these minis
are such a good value but this one is
slow burn and I remember when I got the
collection which was a while ago but I
was so excited one of the Marc Jacobs
lipsticks were in there
I heard so many people raving about them
but these are $30 for a full-size
regular lipstick and I was like your
girls just can't afford a $30 lipstick
right now so to get a mini and to be
able to try it out
I've gone on to repurchase a full-size
Marc Jacobs little products because it
sold me that much it sold me that much I
mean I'm pretty sure I bought them
during the vib sale to get a discount
but it still sold me that much on these
lipsticks I love this formula again it's
very creamy it's nice and long-lasting
it makes the lips look nice and makes
them feel nice this is a beautiful pink
shade again like I said the Kat Von D
this one and the next one that I have I
feel like those colors are all pretty
similar so it might just be do you have
a brand preference do you have like a
price point preference things like that
but this one is definitely the most
expensive that I'm going to talk about I
think out of all of the lipsticks I'm
talking about but man man do I like this
color I've been reaching for slow-burn
it for a very long time since getting
this one and I just think this formula
is really really nice trying to get at
this combo I mean I just you know I'm a
deal chaser guy that does kind of peek
in but next time I have one here from
makeup forever
again it came in a Sephora lip
collection this one is in the shade c21
one and it's one of the artists rouge
creme lipsticks make it forever has
really crazy names for these this
lipstick is so pretty and I did not
expect to enjoy it as much as I did I
think because of when I first got this
one I wasn't asked familiar with makeup
forever so when the lipstick came in
there I was like okay and I think this
is one of the last ones that I really
decided to test out other than just like
watching them for like my review video
and such this was one of the last ones
that I tried out because I just didn't
really gravitate towards a ton and after
I put it on I was like okay okay I
actually really like this again the
color is similar to the last year that I
talked about but I do like the formula
as well I think that this one out of the
three shades that I say are similar this
would probably be my least favorite
formula if I'm being honest it's a
little bit more on the drier side and
it's not quite as creamy to apply but
it's still once I have it on I think
that it looks really good
I feel like it stays really well on the
lips and I really do enjoy this color I
believe the full-size for the makeup
Forever's are about twenty-two dollars
and I really do enjoyed this color if I
have one here from milk makeup these are
just called their lip colors I believe
these are twenty-two dollars as well
talked about these quite a bit because I
feel like people either really really
enjoy them or you really really dislike
them but I'm someone who really really
enjoys them and this is always in my
clash with me when I'm going traveling
this is always coming with me when I'm
just going out for a night on the town
this is coming out in my clutch with me
because I love this color so much this
is definitely one of those nudes that's
like your lips but better it just makes
my lips look like they're pouty I just
enjoyed this color so much I also really
do like the formula I think it's easy to
apply especially for being a matte
lipstick sometimes matte lipsticks are
not my favorite like matte regular
lipsticks are not my favorite because I
feel like they can be hard to apply and
they kind of like skip around my lips
and such but these are really easy to
apply but then they do dry down matte
they're a little bit on the drying side
but I think that they last a frickin
crazy long time I can remember
tailgating for a football game this past
thought it would have button past fall
or whatnot and I put this on it like
5:30 in the morning when we had to go
out to tailgate and by the time we came
home which I mean it was like six
o'clock at night probably my lipsticks
still looked great I've been drinking
the entire time simply orange juice was
no champagne in it at all and my
lipstick still looks fantastic after all
those hours and all of the drinking I
thought that was pretty fantastic so I
really do like this and I take it with
me quite a bit so did I even say the
shade name of this one it's cream cream
from milk the milk makeup lip color
really you like this one and then the
final one is one of my newest lipsticks
to me and I kind of went back and forth
cuz I was like I've only had this one
before I don't a month maybe solves like
is it really fair to include in my like
top video but I know that I love this
lipstick formula because I've tried
others in the past I just don't have any
in the nude pink category and this is a
beautiful nude and I've already worn it
in several of my videos this is from
Urban Decay it's in collaboration with
Kristen and LeAnn and the new collection
that they did and this is in the shade
bun-bun this is one of the comfort matte
comfort matte lipsticks and these are
seventeen or so
18:50 somewhere around in there I'll
have prices listed on the description
box as well but this is a beautiful lip
color I love this nude it's it's it's a
nude with like a little bit of spice to
it and I think it's so beautiful but
like I said I have to hit the urban
decay lipstick formula in the past I
have the shade in 1993 as well which i
think is absolutely beautiful I love
wearing that lipstick but this is so
nice so comfortable it's not the longest
lasting lipstick especially even just
out of these regular lipsticks I've been
talking about there's a few others that
last longer but it's super easy to
reapply I love the color and again I
love how it says it's a comfort matte it
is it's super comfortable on the lips
and I think it's very flattering and I
just I really enjoy that shade so the
Urban Decay it Kristin LeeAnn bun-bun I
think it's a good one so then I'm going
to move on to the liquid lipstick
formula I have it to here from NYX these
are my classic staples from NYX
Cosmetics these are soft matte lip
creams the first shade that I have here
is London this is one of the first soft
matte lip creams that I purchased from
NYX Cosmetics and it is such a gorgeous
nude I absolutely love it I love the
soft matte lip creams I'm always
recommending them again this is another
one where it's like if you kind of want
to start to try out liquid lipsticks but
you're maybe nervous about them or you
still don't want to spend a lot of money
on them these are like seven dollars
depending on where you get them but they
are super super comfortable are more
long-lasting than a regular lipstick but
I will say that I don't feel like they
last the absolute longest but again at
seven dollars and four how comfortable
they are
I still think that's pretty freaking
amazing and they are just I mean the the
name describes them they're super soft
when you apply them to the lips and I
think that's pretty awesome but London
is one of my absolute favorites and then
my other nude that I really enjoy and
it's just a little bit kind of maybe on
the lighter side then London London's
maybe a bit deeper than this one but
this is Abu Dhabi
I got this off a recommendation from it
desi Perkins and it's been one of my
favorites I have repurchased both of
these London I don't even know how many
times I've repurchase Abu Dhabi I think
I've just purchased the one time since
it is a bit of a newer shade to me but
again I love Abu Dhabi as well soft
matte lip creams are one of my favorite
formulas but these two shades in
particular are two of my favorite needs
another one from NYX Cosmetics this is
one of the liquid suede lipstick
and this is in the shade at sandstorm I
love this shade I really really enjoyed
the NYX liquid suede formula they're a
little bit longer lasting than the soft
matte lip creams but they're a little
bit more on the drying side so it just
kind of depends on what it is that you
want but again these are around seven
dollars as well but sandstorm is such a
really cool color I really like the way
it looks on the lips so I enjoyed that
one next up I have one here from mac
cosmetics this is in the shade burnt
spice this is one of their retro matte
lipsticks which I believe are $21 this
was one when I put it on my lips I was
like just found my perfect nude found it
found it I think it is so so beautiful
again it's like one of those your lips
the better type of nudes I really love
the applicators on these how they're
like really kind of like pointed at the
end because I feel like it kind of helps
to line the lips because I don't use a
lip liner a ton I feel like I like to
gravitate towards nude lipsticks because
I do kind of like to over line my lips
with them and I feel like it looks more
natural with a nude versus like a red or
you know just a more colorful lipstick I
just feel like it looks a little bit
more natural with the nude lipsticks but
I love this one from Mac these I don't
think again are the longest lasting
liquid lipstick that I've ever tried but
they are easy to reapply which is not
always the case with with liquid
lipsticks but I love this color I love
this color so much one of my absolute
favorites next up I have one here from
Sigma Beauty and this is in the shade
nude mod these liquid lipsticks are
newer to a sigma but I was really really
excited over them there is also another
shade it's called foxglove but it's more
of like a brighter like blackberry type
of color but that I love it so much if
you guys would want to see a video on
like my top favorite more like colorful
lipsticks or red lipsticks or something
like that do let me know that one from
Sigma would definitely be included in
there but this is the first liquid
lipstick that I tried out from Sigma
beauty and I was very very impressed
with these when I first put it on I will
say that it felt pretty dry and almost
kind of more of a moosie texture which
is not my favorite type of liquid
lipstick and I was like mm ooh
good try Sigma but
I think you're gonna be for me and then
I wore it throughout the day and it
immediately got really comfortable I was
worried it was gonna be too dry and
almost kind of like shriveling my lips
up and just look weird but throughout
the day it held up really well so I
tried it out a couple more times and I
was like okay I'm I'm actually impressed
with this liquid lipstick I didn't think
you were gonna get me Sigma but you got
me so I do recommend these these are $15
and the shade new mod is a really
beautiful kind of like a nude pink color
I think it's really flattering on the
lips and especially when I wear more of
like a Mavi makeup look I do like to
pair it with the new mod because I feel
like it really pulls everything together
so I do enjoy that shade and then
another one here is from Oprah cosmetics
/ definitely has one of my favorite
liquid lipstick formulas as I was going
through my overall it cigs I realized I
actually do have quite a bit more of
like just like colorful or kind of like
different colors I had a few nudes and
Pink's but this one definitely would be
my favorite and the one that I really
wanted to make sure I had mentioned and
this one is in Manila I love this nude
as well this was like my summer go to
Oprah like lettering on here is almost
completely worn away and I think that
just shows you like how much I was using
it because I love Manila so much but for
cosmetics I feel like has a really good
liquid lipstick a formula long-lasting
again a touch more on the dry side but
nothing where it's so bad that again I
would need to wear lip balm like I do
some other liquid lipsticks and things
like that so I really do like these I
find them to be long-lasting and they're
about 17 dollars and you can also find
over at Ulta
all righty home stretch here so I have
some lipsticks here from a Kat Von D
like I was saying the first one here is
bow and arrow this is the first eye
liquid lipstick then I got from Kat Von
D and wow did I just mmm this shade is
so beautiful we went to a concert last
weekend we saw if I'm simple wool for my
Valentine and this is the lipstick of
that I wore I just feel like it goes
with like we go to a lot of rock
concerts I feel like this is one of my
most reached for lip shades wouldn't we
go out to those rap concerts it's a nude
but it's a deeper nude and I just think
it is so pretty and I feel like it's
really flattering on me and these hold
up for a very long time again on the
drier side but for me I don't mind it at
all because they stay I put this on at I
don't know five o'clock maybe last a
Friday night and at 2:00 a.m. I was
scrubbing it off my
lips with a makeup wipe in the hotel
room so I really really enjoy
bow-and-arrow it's been one of my
favorite shades for a very long time but
then also the Kat Von D shade and Ludwig
is one of my favorites I know I might be
mispronouncing that that's what I'm
gonna roll with this one is really
beautiful and it's more of like a nude
pink shade I just really do like this
formula because I feel like a lot of
times with liquid lipsticks when I put
them on I want to put them on once and
then go out and then forget about them
you know depending on what it is I'm
doing but if I'm having a night where
I'm going out living it up like the
crazy 30 year old that I am I'm not
crazy at all I'm having those nights I
want to apply my lipstick once and then
forget about it and I can do that with
the Kat Von D lipsticks and I really do
like this one for more of a softer look
next up here I have some shades from
Kota Beauty Buddha has some of my
favorite lipsticks and I feel like these
are like the most different out of my
lipstick collection but I still love
them because the formula is very thin
and very watery and if you've been
hearing me talk about my liquid lipstick
for vilas you're hearing me say a touch
on the dry side a touch on the dry side
these are the absolute opposite of dry
they are wet they take a while to dry
down I mean they take a few minutes to
dry down on your lips so I recommend
when you put these on like don't don't
be doing anything right away like don't
put a shirt on don't be eating something
because they will transfer but once they
do completely dry down that they do dry
down matte and then they stay in place
my two favorite shades that I wanted to
recommend are in wifey and then also
girlfriend girlfriend was my first a
full-size of hooda Beauty lipstick I
purchased two different sets of minis
from her and then when she had a bunch
of nudes come out I purchased a girl
friend which is a really beautiful
I think it's described as an apricot
nude and I would agree with that
strangely enough I mean I feel like
that's kind of like the perfect way to
describe girlfriend but I really enjoy
that one and then this one isn't the
latest nude set that I bought from huda
beauty and there isn't wifey haven't
wearing this in a couple of videos
lately cuz it's just such a I just feel
like it's such a flattering nude on me I
really do like this formula but if you
do not like thin if you do not like
watery liquid lipstick so you will not
like these at all again make sure to let
them
right down for a little bit but I have
probably I'm gonna say ten who had a
beauty like what lipsticks I've bought
all of them myself and I mean if that
doesn't tell you how much I love a
product I don't no one does but I really
enjoy her liquid lipsticks and those are
two of my favorite shades and then last
up I have dose of colors of course I
know if you've been following my channel
you probably knew I was gonna be talking
about dose of colors this is a shade
that I don't think is in stock yet
permanently you have heard Anna the
owner of dose of colors say that she was
going to be releasing these as well
because they came in a holiday set so
you could buy them in threes and she
said everything in the holiday set was
going to become available permanently as
well this one isn't lazy Daisy and it's
such a pretty pink like a deep rosy pink
and I enjoy it so much
I think the dose of colors a liquid
lipstick formula is absolutely amazing
I'm so glad I finally started trying
dose of colors I'm so glad that came in
to Ulta because that's probably most
definitely what convinced me to start
purchasing from a dose of colors and
I've been so impressed with so many
other products but especially their
liquid lipsticks are some of my
favorites I think these are around $17 I
want to say $18 but my absolute favorite
from dose of colors
is stone I love stone this is the one
that everybody was raving about for the
longest time and I was like I want dose
of color stone too and when it came into
Ulta I was there I was there on the dot
that dose of colors became available and
also online
I bought stoned the second it became
available and within like a like an hour
or something stone was sold out and I
was like I knew that was gonna happen I
knew that was gonna happen and that's
why I was there I did not do that for a
lot of makeup but I did it for stone and
I have no regrets about it I love the
shape so much it's a beautiful pinky
nude on me I love the dose of colors
liquid lipstick formula I probably have
seven or so of the liquid lipstick
shades but lazy Daisy and then stone
would be two of my favorites okay so
that's gonna be everything for my top 20
nude and pink lipstick shades and some
of my favorite lipstick formulas as well
I really hope that you enjoyed this
video or found it helpful in some way I
can do let me know if you'd want to see
IDEO similar to this with my more like
colorful lipstick choices favorites I
