today's video is going to be my five
best and worst eyes shadow palette this
is a requested video from a handful of
subscribers I haven't seen the requests
coming to make this video and I also
included it on my most recent Twitter
poll each month I do a poll on my
Twitter which is at by Samantha March
and I asked which video you want to see
me film first I usually do have three
different options and then whichever one
is the most requested that's what I will
film first and for the month of March it
was most requested to film my 5 best and
worst i shadow pelops so that is what
today's video is going to be so I'm
excited to share with you some of my
favorites and net of so much favorites
in the eyeshadow palette category so if
you would like to see my picks for this
video please keep watching so I thought
I kind of alternate the like best and
worst type of category so I'm going to
go worst and best worse and best etc and
so on and for the worst category I mean
I had a couple that I felt like I really
could talk about it but other than that
I don't have a ton of makeup that like I
hate you know what I'm saying like it
was the worst palace for me we're really
hard to chew and so for the ones that I
chose for the worst category I'll
explain you know the best that I can why
I'm putting it in that category but one
that I want to talk about is from pixie
Beauty so I just mentioned this in my
March makeup monthly video which is my
new series where I'm sharing my
favorites my fails and then the fine
makeup product and I mentioned this in
the fine so I wouldn't even put it like
in a fail but out of all of the
eyeshadow palettes that I have like this
one was definitely one that was really
like underwhelming to me this was sent
to me from pixie and their collab that
they did they teamed up with for Beauty
influencers recently came out with some
great collapse this is in collab with
its duty time but it just like missed
the mark for me I really really like
these two shades right here and this
mauve shade is like okay but like none
of the shimmers like worked at all for
me I didn't think any of the shimmers
were very good and like overall I just
thought it was like okay
unfortunately this one I don't love it
you know I don't hate it it Nelson
in my market makeup monthly like I don't
hate it I'm not going to get rid of it
but it's just like it just feels like
underwhelming to me in the best category
I'm not really going to any particular
order I just kind of like I'm grabbing
the products as I see them on my desk
but this should come as no surprise this
was featured in my 2016 makeup favorites
is from Tarte cosmetics and
collaboration was styled by her Rouge
and it is the eye and cheek palette
event they came out with I love this
palette I have talked about it so much
like I have talked about it so much and
I don't feel like this was like a super
hyped product I didn't buy this because
of the collaboration I bought it because
I'm super interested in what was inside
the palette it's only $30 you get a huge
blush and six eyeshadows and a mirror
and they're all really good shades so
here is a close-up of the palette so you
have the six eyeshadows and then the dry
Norma's blush the blush is amazing it's
beautiful I love it the eyeshadows the
masks are gorgeous I can wear the masks
by themselves I wish you guys could see
the discs that I've put in these I chose
like there's a dent in several of them
the shimmers are beautiful but royal
color like a very shimmer beautiful I
just all around I love this palette I
love that it's more compact and I has a
mirror and then I can travel with it
and then I had the blush inside and it's
not just eye shadow this thing has been
so worth the money I was so happy I
decided to pick this up so another
eyeshadow palette that I didn't love
this is from unique I believe this how
you pronounce the brand it's the mood
struct addiction shadow palette so when
you open it up it looks like this inside
it does have a mirror more compact as
well and then all of the shades are very
like neutral Brown there's a couple
shimmers in here this was sent to me by
a friend who sells unique overall again
it's not like it's a really bad palette
I just I really never do reach for it
like even when I first got it and my
makeup question was so much more smaller
than it is now and I wasn't doing near
as many tutorials on Instagram and using
the makeup that everyone wants to see
like even way back
and I just couldn't really get excited
to use this palette if the shimmers are
just okay they're kind of like that
chunky glitter and there was a lot of
fallout with them so the shimmer is like
I mostly stayed away from beau yeah this
one this one wasn't ago and this one is
just kind of like tucked away in my
drawers because I never really reached
for it at all so I mean I wouldn't say
it's like a palette that I hate I just I
really didn't get any good use out of it
and yet the shades just didn't work out
for me so another palette that I love
that I put in the best category is from
morphe and I feel like you guys probably
are going to know what's inside just
sell it who can guess what this palette
is yes it's this recital
obviously it's so thirty-five out like
what palette did you think I was going
to put in here bro morphe everybody
loves the three 5l palette and you guys
I was so late to this game I was so late
to the game getting this palette because
I was like I don't know it looks fine
but Oh lots of orange and what would I
do with this palette yeah man Samantha
like I missed out everybody started
buying it this thing could not be kept
in stock like more if we could not keep
it in stock for anything and then it
would come back and stock for like a
minute and then it would sell out again
and I kept missing it and I kept missing
it but finally I finally got it I think
it's back in stock more regularly now I
don't check it like I used to because I
used to want the palette I don't check
it like I used to but I'm pretty sure it
stays in stock a lot better now I reach
for this palette so often I don't know
if you guys can tell on camera how dirty
it is but I reach for this palette so
much some of these shimmers in here this
one in particular is an absolute
favorite I love the shimmer here I will
actually come back to that shortly and
talk to you guys more about that one
this one the shimmer right here is
absolutely stunning but then all of
these mats these Browns these oranges
this khaki color I wear all the time
just that alone all over my lids
I love the oranges you can do a smokey
eye there is so much that you can do
with this palette that's not 35
shades and it's only like $20 if you use
a more feet discount code which
everybody in their brother has not made
of no no not me but everybody else has a
mortgage code and so you can get this
for like 20 bucks I think it like 22 if
you don't use a code like it's so good
people people raved about it is out of
stock for very good reason I love this
eyeshadow palette I would definitely
recommend it for morphe so the next
Worst that I have I'm kind of cheating
because it's not really a palette
palette but it's like a little pellet
that I made myself but these are my
single unfussy Beverly Hills I shadow
when you buy four from also when I
bought these far from also you could get
a free like little palette to put them
in so that is what I did I picked out my
four shades I was hearing so many good
things about the Amistad via single
shadows and always think people use them
and might be excited for him I'm like
okay I need to get them so I did I
picked out two maps and two shimmers the
masks are Birkin and Bert orange the
shimmers are pink champagne and henna I
really dislike the shimmers and because
of the experience that I had with these
shades when the modern renaissance
palette came out and everyone was
freaking out over it I was like no I'm
not going to get it because I didn't
think the singles were all that great
and I will say it the math like I do
love Bergen and burnt orange I wear all
the time I wear them alone
I wear them together I really love the
matte but I really really don't like the
shimmers and it convinced me not to get
the Modern Renaissance palette even
after hearing everybody loving it I was
so like are they telling the truth I
don't know I have since gone on to
purchase the Minor Renaissance Palace
and I love it so I'm glad about that
but I just thought I would throw that
out there because I nice where like
these two I swear that I hear people
talk about them and they say such the
things about them and I think I want the
only person in the world that doesn't
like pink champagne and henna from
Australia but I really don't when I was
thinking about this video I had for like
I came up with the floor palette that I
could talk about and I couldn't find it
one in my collection like I just
couldn't think of a fifth pallet and I
was like you know why I'll talk about
these because I really don't like these
to shimmer shades so I've kind of gone
off the grid here but that's what I'm
going to do like to me pink champagne
was just like I don't know was like
nothing like I don't I don't even feel
like it's watches great I just don't
feel like it does anything I don't know
like it just kind of looks like I put
some glitter on my eyes or something I
don't know I didn't think it was great
and then henna I like the color and I
like the final look that it gives but it
has so much fallout and because it's
like a this darker orange color once I
get to fall out all over my eyes it's
just disaster City it's just a disaster
if I forget and I go in and do my face
first and then I come in and I use henna
no matter if I'm putting it all over my
eye I'm just putting a teeny bit on my
eye it doesn't matter the fallout of
silk strings and I've ruined my makeup
look or it's like one of those shades
that where if I do my eyes first I have
to come in with a makeup remover wipe
and wipe my entire face off because the
fall is so extreme like it makes me not
want to use these shades and like I said
there's a shade in the 3 500 from morphe
that's really really similar to this in
color and has like practically no
fallout so when I want this type of like
orangish shimmer type of look I reach
for the 3 5 L versus using henna and
henna was like expensive compared to
fine the entire palette you know what
I'm saying so I don't know those two
single shades from a massage yet did
nothing for me the math I was really
happy with the shimmers now happy with
it all like I never never reach for them
I thought I would mention that because
yeah I really really wasn't thrilled
with those two shades okay said when I
was talking about Anasazi single shadows
I did eventually purchase the mana
Renaissance palette and i'm glad that i
did because yes it is in my best
category I love this eyeshadow palette
and that's like what kind of frustrated
me even more about being so put off by
the singles that I didn't buy this
because I had a way for ever to buy this
because they kept going out of stock
everybody wanted this pal
it was like impossible to keep in stock
but I actually snagged it during the
supportive Eid sale so I even got mine
for 20% off which I thought was a great
deal
I love the outer packaging that's kind
of like velvety type oh I just yes like
that was awesome you got a nice mirror
inside and then all of these absolutely
beautiful shades this palette is the
bomb and people speak so highly about it
and I get it there are a couple shades
in here that I'd say like the fallout is
pretty bad with it's not to me to the
extreme of like the single shadows but
definitely you do get fallout with these
not anything too bad I don't think but
it definitely is there and I do hear
people complain about the fallout I
don't get it I would say if you are
using this palette do your eyes first
and do your face makeup second for sure
but it's beautiful like in my shade for
an oranges in here
I just love the burnt orange shade but
these mats are stunning they are so
freakin pretty these oranges this
realgar is like insane I love these like
pink burgundy type of shades these
lighter shades I'm in love with this
gold is beautiful like this is a palette
that has a shade where I would use every
single shade I'm pretty much confident I
have used every single shade in this
palette where there's some where you
just you don't really care for you don't
really want to use them they're not good
shade you don't grab you know whatever
the reason is but I can use every single
shade out of here this is the gorgeous
palette I know people talk about it all
the time I mean there's no way I could
have a best I shadow palette video
without including the mono Renaissance
like that would just be so ver this made
so this is the great one so the last two
palettes that I have in the worst
category I don't have them here to show
you because I returned both of them and
I don't like makeup and I don't foresee
myself using a product that I have
bought especially if it's high end I do
return it I got a comment other day in
one of my videos that I was trying to
like justify a purchase I wouldn't feel
bad keeping an eyeshadow palette that is
not the way that I roll I'm not
going I don't have a beauty room I don't
have a lot of space for my makeup
collection and I'm not going to clutter
up my office even more with makeup that
I'm not going to get good use out of so
I don't need to justify keeping my
makeup like I can justify my makeup
purchases I don't need to justify
keeping makeup around if I don't like it
I'm not going to get a use out of it I
hate it like whatever it is I will
return it so these last two piles I'm
going to talk about our palettes that I
returned because I just really did not
love them I have done videos about them
so if you guys are not new to my channel
you're not going to be surprised at all
when I talk about these but the first
one is from Smashbox it was their soft
light palette I can include pictures
here so you guys can see it Smashbox
came out with seven like more travel
size smaller eyeshadow palettes in
collaboration with actress Shane
Mitchell it ordered mine from Sephora
they actually sent me the wrong one and
then of course by the time I got it and
saw the issue with it they couldn't do
anything about it because this house
were out of stock so I ended up just
returning it but I did give it a fair
chance I was like well even though this
is wasn't the one that I want it may be
I love it and I didn't I can leave my
video link down below that I did on this
palette the shades were just so light
but the palette is called soft light and
that's why I didn't order that palette I
said you know what I'm saying like I
knew that I probably was not going to
love the shades inside and I didn't so
that's why I was like even more
disappointed that I got the wrong
palette and they couldn't help me out
with it and so I just you know I had to
end up returning it the shades were just
so so light they barely showed up on my
eyes it was really hard like I think how
many shades did it come with like seven
or something like over half of the shade
really did not show up there was a
couple in there that were really pretty
for a softer look but overall on the
whole it just didn't make any sense for
me to keep that palette and I get a full
look out of it because every shade in
there was a shimmer shade and like it
just was going to be a palette that I
knew I would not reach
or I gave it a best shot because I also
I don't love returning makeup I want to
like the things I buy and I'm very
careful about the things I buy I've
watched the reviews I see the early
reviews and I see what people are saying
I look at the swatches I'm very careful
with how I spend my money I don't have a
urge and just go out and buy whatever it
is that I want to buy it I try to be
more selective than that but if it's
something that's really not going to
work for me
I will return it I felt like I gave this
one a really fair chance I tried several
times several different looks and it
just it wasn't working out for me so
unfortunately the Smashbox soft light
palette it did not work the shadows were
just way too light and just not
pigmented enough for me just we think it
along we didn't get along that one
another palette that I really love and I
feel like I talked about it a lot but I
don't do a lot of others talk about it
this is from Smashbox it is the photo
Matt eyes palette so this is what it
looks like it's an all matte eyeshadow
palette it does have the mirror and it
also comes with a double-ended brush now
some palettes do like the Anasazi a
modern renaissance does and I think that
brush is like fine but most brushes that
come and palettes I actually don't like
but I really let's do like this brush
and I use it very very frequently which
i think is a huge bonus like you get to
you know essentially two brushes I think
that was a huge bonus but I really
really love this palette I have used it
in so many tutorials I reach for it so
often when I want like my go to Matt I
look I think it has tons of beautiful
Browns and like the neutral shades in
here but then they have like really like
interesting colors to me like there is a
blue over here that I absolutely love
there is a pink over here that I think
is so pretty
there is a really nice black in here
when I first got this palette this
listened to me from Smashbox like a very
long time ago when I first got this
palette and opened it up I was like yeah
I can create like one look out of that
like maybe two look no that is not true
and I think all matte palettes can kind
of get that especially like more neutral
table palettes I'm sorry the Sun just
like went away and I feel like I'm
shrouded in darkness right now that was
really crazy but I feel like all matte
palette and like neutral palettes can
kind of get like oh you can only create
a couple of looks out of it and this
palette and the next pot my michelle has
made not believe that anymore because
there's just so many looks you can do
with this I think the shades are so pre
they're very pigmented there's like
basically no fallout with this palette
like even with the black shade like the
fallout there's just nothing I use this
palette so much I reach for it so much I
feel like more people should talk about
it I think it's just so good so the
Smashbox photo Matt eyes palette is
truly one of my favorites
so my final worst palette you guys you
know if you guys are not new to my
channel you know what I'm going to say
don't you we could all say together one
two three the Too Faced white chocolate
chip palette no I don't have the palette
because I did return it and I was that
was a happy day when I did and I
remember returning it to Sephora and the
woman who was handling the return just
laughed she didn't even ask me if it is
anything wrong with it just no questions
she just laughed as she did the return
and I just thought to myself that's
interesting but it was so funny you guys
so to base came out with the white
chocolate chip palette Nelson came out
the chocolate chip palette they came out
with these before their big peach
collection craziness and I bought into
it was another one I got it right around
the time of the Smashbox one I gave was
a really fair champ I tried really hard
I wanted to make that palette work I
really did I wanted that palette to work
I was so excited about it and I did a
first impression on camera and you could
see me like oh oh something's happening
here this is not not good it just wasn't
a good palette and I really don't hear a
lot of good things about them both about
the white chocolate chip and also the
chocolate chip like it was just people
are very underwhelmed by this and I
think a lot of reach
once happened and I think that's why the
Sephora woman laughed when I returned it
because I think that she's probably been
dealing with that for quite some time
honestly like I talked about this in my
one of my most recent will i buy videos
when I was talking about while I buy the
Too Faced peanut butter and honey
palette I'll leave the oh I buy it video
linked below but I go into my thoughts
on like filler items that I feel like
makeup brands are coming out with
because Too Faced really sees too many
palettes and then came out with a huge
peach collection all these craziness
they were sending bloggers to LA and
there was a huge party going on
everybody was getting these ginormous
packages and it was crazy and I decided
and why did you come out with a very
very mediocre palettes why did you not
just wait for the peach collection so I
talked about my opinion on filler
products in that video so I'll leave a
link down below but honestly that
fellow's made me so mad that I haven't
purchased them toothpaste yet like I'm
still saucy with them I really am I'll
pop I'm sure I'll get over it and I'm
sure they'll come up with something that
I feel like I absolutely have to have
but that that whole situation made me
like take a step back I was like whoa
whoa well I feel like I got played I
feel like I got played so you know the
two-faced the white chocolate chip
pellet was not for me I don't recommend
it and it definitely made it into my
worst I shadow palette category I'm so
sorry about the lighting I don't know I
think there's a huge storm cloud came
and covered the Sun but it's like dark
and I only have one more power to talk
about so far I do the whole process of
setting up all my lights I'm going to
talk about the last palette and then we
can go and I can go look for the
sunshine but my very last eyelids talked
about in the best category is the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I love
this palette so much I recommend it all
the time that's like super special to me
it was one of like the first higher-end
palettes that I bought after being on
YouTube and like really starting to try
to learn makeup and listening to reviews
in washington toriel's
and you know trying to figure everything
out makeup wise because I really didn't
have a clue before I got on YouTube and
a lot of people would recommend this
palette a lot of people
tutorials with it and I bought it and
you know Kat Von D is more of a high-end
brand a little bit nervous about it said
mostly just been buying drugstore and
I'm super impressed with it it does have
a mirror and it has all of these
beautiful matte shades again this is
another all matte fairly you know
neutral eyeshadow palette it does remind
me of Smashbox photo Matt eyes palette
but it reminds me of that palette in a
very good way because again you can
create so many different looks at this
these eyeshadows are so good they are so
blendable from very minimal looks from
very smoky looks from over the top looks
bold looks just a straight neutral look
there are so many different things that
you can do and another thing about this
palette is kind of what it reminds me of
the Anasazi modern renaissance I have
used every single shade in this palette
and it will continue to use every single
shade there's not a bad shade in here
there's not a shade in here that I'm
like oh I just I just can't bring myself
to use that every single shade is good
this is such this is such a good palette
it's just one of my all-time favorites
if anybody asked me for a good you know
palette recommendation I'm constantly
saying this palette so the Kat Von D
shade + light eye palette is definitely
in the best eyeshadow palette category
hey guys that is going to be everything
for my 5 best and worst items cause I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video
it was definitely so much harder to
think of my five favorite ones like I
had other ones that were super close to
making the mark but there was just some
that if I had to actually stop and think
about it but I would recommend and that
I like just ate a little bit more
it was definitely harder to come up with
the worst ones but hopefully I did it ok
another job explaining why those
palettes just weren't for me but I
really hope that you guys like this
video if you guys so much for requesting
this video thank you for voting for it
on Twitter those polls really do help me
out let me know what you want to see I'm
fairly confident of crazy storm is
moving in because now the sky is turning
like green so I'm in front of a very big
window so I am going to go now because
I'm a little bit spooked right at this
moment I'm so sorry my lighting went so
dark but I'm fairly sure a crazy storm
is moving in so I'm going to go I hope

thumbs up if you did enjoy it make sure
