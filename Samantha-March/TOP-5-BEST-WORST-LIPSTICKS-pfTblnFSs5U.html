today's video is going to be another top
five best and worst and I'm going to be
doing lipsticks which I am so excited to
chat about some of my favorites and then
not so favorite lipsticks I also did a
top five best and worse with eyeshadow
palette so I will leave that link down
below and what that video everybody said
that they wanted to see my opinions on
the lipsticks I had a tough time not so
much taking my worst lipsticks because
that was pretty simple to me but to the
five of my favorites and ones that I
continually wear and really want to
recommend that was really hard I think I
started with ten and I somehow and
narrowed it down to five so I am super
excited to share with you guys my top 5
best and worst lipsticks so why don't we
go ahead and get started
I'm going to do like what I did in the
eyeshadow palette video I'm going to
skip back and forth between a best and
worst I don't have a particular category
like if I have liquid lipsticks in here
regular lipsticks lip glosses things
like that so I don't have a secure
category I'll be talking about both
high-end and drugstore in both of the
categories you guys are not new to my
channel recently you probably know that
these were going to be in here it is the
wet and wild
liquid cat food liquid lipsticks I just
really do not like these I did a full
swatch video on them when they first
came out and you could tell that I was
seriously underwhelmed at this I
mentioned it in one of my makeup monthly
videos and I put it in the fail category
and when I was doing my most recent
lipstick declutter I decluttered all of
my shades I did pass on quite a few of
them formula was just not for me I did
not find it to be long wearing in the
absolute slightest I mentioned in one of
my videos that I put it on to some video
and by the time I got done through that
video it was completely worn off on the
inner part of my lips like it just
doesn't have any sort of long wire to me
and I find them very streaky even some
of the lighter colors because I've tried
I think five different shades of these
even the lighter colors are very streaky
patchy you know a lot of people love
these and when I say that I don't like
them a lot of people are like you crazy
girl they are amazing and if they work
for you that is fantastic and I'm super
stoked for you because that's awesome
but unfortunately they do not work for
me
so they have to make it into the worst
category one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks and what I'm wearing on my
lips right now are the Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipstick I absolutely
adore these I have one in bow-and-arrow
which is still in my travel makeup bag
because I'm just getting home one was in
my purse because like I said it is what
I'm wearing on my lips today this one is
in Ludwig I just bought this in the
sephora vib sale because I knew I needed
to pick up another cap on dealing with
lipstick the bow and arrow was just not
cutting it anymore and I needed another
one so this one is a really nice nude
pink and I absolutely love it
I've only had this lipstick for 3-4 days
I think I've had the lipstick for four
days and I born it three out of the four
day as bad as how much I love it these
are $20 so they are more expensive but I
find them to be absolutely amazing I
love this color I was wearing it on
snapchat and immediately people start
asking what it was and I was like
usually I try to wait with my hauls if I
am doing up they call like this for the
IB I try to wait before I dig into
everything until I can do the haul video
but because I'm still waiting on one box
I'm like I'm sorry I had to dig into it
so this one is the cat want the Ludd way
to enjoyed this formula it's a thinner
formula and it feels very lightweight on
the lips like it doesn't feel sticky or
heavy or drying or anything like that so
I wouldn't say this is my longest
lasting a liquid lipstick it still does
last very long and especially if you
pair a lip liner with a Kat Von D's like
if you line your lips and then fill them
in and then put the liquid lipstick over
it I think it looks amazing I wear them
so much like I said bow and arrow is one
of my absolutely favorite shades done
quick is my new jam at this moment but
the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipsticks I love these I know that I
want even more shades so I have a lip
gloss that I also put in my declutter
video because they are just not for me
they are the colourpop lip glosses have
a mini here I got sent and mini because
kind of top messed up one of my orders
and spent a couple mini lip glosses as
like their apology and they are just
they are just not for me the shade that
I still have is in finders-keepers
I passed along the other one and I feel
like these lip glosses swatch really
well look I feel like that looks like a
good lip gloss swatch like ours can be
you know it looks great
but when I actually applied to my list
and start to actually move the wand
around all of this pigment is like like
this nice mauve color that you see it
just goes away and it just kind of looks
like I have a very very light lip gloss
on and I also found them to be very very
sticky and you know if you lick your
lips a couple of times you blitz the
lipgloss completely off like there's
just no lasting power to it at all I'm
not a huge lipgloss person in general
myself maybe if you just love lip
glosses and what they and they are what
you continually reach for maybe you
would like this one but I can't
recommend it I couldn't get it to work
for me I had two different shades and I
tried them both and they just really did
absolutely nothing for me color top is
pretty affordable I think these are like
five or six dollars for like an actual
like regular sized tube of lip gloss but
still I declared both of them I don't I
know I would never wear them so this had
to go in my worst category so another
one of my favorite liquid lipsticks I
feel like I talked about these a lot as
well are the huda beauty liquid
lipsticks I am so upset because the
Sephora vib sale was just going on and
who to just release a bunch of new news
I mentioned it in my vib sale
recommendations video and my wishlist
video and I said I was so excited I was
really wanting to pick up one of the new
nudes I mentioned wifey from Hooda that
I wanted to get and I was so fun to see
that they've only released on her
website so far they haven't made it to
Sephora yet I was like no I didn't take
up another hooda lipstick in that haul
because I'm really waiting for these
nudes because I just feel like they
scream me but I can't wait to get them
because I love this formula this is one
that I don't think it's going to be for
everybody though and I'll explain why
this formula of liquid lipstick is super
super liquidy it's very very thin on the
lips but I find it to be super
comfortable very easy to work with easy
to apply I think it stays on for a very
long time the lasting power on this
liquid lipstick I think it's fantastic
it can last me the whole night I
constantly reach for my foodle lipsticks
I have two shades so far I constantly
reach for them because I know as I'm
leaving my house at 10 o'clock in the
morning and I'm going to be out all
night
I know these liquid lipsticks are going
to last me and if they do start to fade
down I can just put another layer over
it like some look what lipsticks are too
like chunky and kind of like drying and
cracking on the list that when you try
to reapply you've just like dumped up
your lesson you are not going to look
very good anymore not with those who
don't look what lipsticks I tried i can
easily reapply them they can be a little
bit sticky even after you've let them
dry down for a little bit they can be a
little bit sticky so if it bothers you
you probably wouldn't like that but it
doesn't last that way forever I still
really like them one of my favorite
formulas again I just so impressed at
how comfortable it feels on the list and
how long-lasting it is this shade that I
have right now is in trendsetter
bombshell is the other shade that I have
which is a nude pink and that one is
still in my trouble makeup bags but this
is trend setter it's a gorgeous I love
these like nude Browns they're just new
Brown's new pinks nudes like those are
my jam those are my color family and
what I wear so much and I just love the
two to one I also love bombshell and I'm
super anxious to pick up a couple more
liquid lipsticks
I'm always recommending these these
again are twenty dollars a piece
so they are a little bit more pricey I
have little guys because I bought them
in a contour set that came with a lip
liner would have no problem spending 220
dollars for one more foot lipstick
because I know it's worth it so I would
do it oh the next one that did not work
for me is a liquid lipstick this is from
Giorgio Armani and these are called the
lips magnets is a wretched I think it's
in 404 all maybe I can't remember and it
doesn't say there is the swatch and I
don't know if you'd be able to tell from
the swatch like on camera I can tell as
I put it on my hand it just is not any
sort of like a full-coverage type of
lipstick it is very patchy on the lips
it's really hard to build up the color I
just this just did nothing for me and
these are $38 and I do not find that
price tag or thit at all I got sent two
different colors these were sent to me
from Influenster and just for the price
sake I just definitely would not be able
to recommend them but even if it wasn't
an expensive lipstick I just don't find
it good anyways even
so the drops are lipstick like it's just
not a good liquid lipstick I find them
to be long wearing either and again just
application processes to me it's just
like a disaster so the Giorgio Armani
lip magnets were just a they're a hard
pass for me our recent favorites of mine
but since I've gotten them whoa Nelly I
have been impressed and I know a lot of
people have been asking me about these
because I did recently haul them I've
been getting asked my opinions on them
and I'm super excited to put them in my
favorite category these are the morphe
liquid lipsticks okay I feel like I
don't hear a lot of people talking about
these I know the more feel is what
lipsticks are a bit newer they're not
new new but they are a bit newer and I
was kind of on the fence about buying
them because I hadn't really heard
anybody talking about them are using
them so like I don't know does that mean
they're not good these are $12 I believe
I bought them when I purchased the
morphe 35o palette I guess the morphe
35o palette and I grabbed some makeup
brushes and I was like you know why I'm
such a lipstick lover I love being able
to try out different brands who's going
to grab a couple liquid lipsticks and
see how I like them and I love them I am
obsessed with them I love the colors I
got I got peanut and then also
schoolgirl peanut is that brown shade as
well that I absolutely love I think I
have formed peanut in two different
videos now so there is peanut I know I
just wore it in a recent one and then
school girl I know I believe I wore this
one in my dupes video is a gorgeous
gorgeous pink as when a schoolgirl I'm
continually wearing them because I love
them this formula lasts a super long
time I was wearing peanut last night and
I ate Chinese food and I had noodles and
they were oily I was eating crab rangoon
I was drinking soda and I remember
standing in the checkout line with my
friend Ashley and she was like your
lipstick still looks really good I was
like it's more feet I love these liquid
lipsticks and this is why it's because
they last and they look so good
this is not a formula that I feel like
you can build up because it's a little
bit thicker it's not super super thick
because I do not like really thick
really smooth e liquid lipstick but it's
still a thicker formula it's not like
CUDA or Kat Von D at all so you can't
really
build it up but that's fine because you
don't need to because they last the last
throughout meals I'm super impressed
with them I love the colors that I
picked up I definitely want to get more
of these I believe they are around the
12 dollar range so there's typically a
discount code with more view so I highly
recommend these like I said I feel like
not a lot of people are talking about
them and I don't know why because I feel
like you guys should give these a try so
the next one I have might be a little
bit surprising because I feel like a lot
of people like these liquid lipsticks
but I don't that's okay I'm envy
minority because it is what it is but
the anasazi a Beverly Hills liquid
lipsticks I just don't like them and I
mentioned it in my declutter video
because I have three of her liquid
lipsticks I talked about it in my
declutter video and I was kind of going
back and forth and I think one of the
things that was like upsetting me was
that their $20.00 piece you know I
bought all of these I was like I don't
know do I give them up I decided to keep
them and then after I did my said
clutter video I was like you know what I
actually I don't need all of these so I
threw Katherine into my little declutter
bag to give away to someone it's a berry
color this one is Katherine this it's
the formula that I don't like because
it's so thick and so mu see it's so hard
to apply I feel like it's a mess I I
don't have big lips but I don't have
small lips a bit like a free average
lips I don't know but I feel like I
cannot get a good application and it's
not that I feel like the wand is really
big or like you know a really outlandish
wand but you can't find your lips like
good with but it's because of the
formula is just it's so hard to apply it
and it just it does not look good and I
feel like it wears very quickly as well
but again I just I don't feel like I've
ever worn an honest Asya lipstick and
been like confident with my application
and that's really sad to me like I said
these are $20 piece so that is more
expensive so I threw Katherine into my
declutter pile and honestly I think I'm
going to throw ashen in there too
because I have a lot of Browns that say
it is a brown lipstick and I mean I just
I have a ton of them and I just I don't
feel like I needed that one
Ashtyn and so I think Dulce is really
the only one that I'm going to keep some
what I mostly use Dulce for like I think
some of the only things I use Dulce for
which is up here is to put in the center
of my lips like if I want to do kind of
like the ombre effect
I have reached for dulce but even
putting this one all over my lips is
just like it's just not good so Dona
Sofia Beverly Hills it like what
lipsticks I'm just me personally I'm
just not a fan of another favorite of
mine that I feel like I have talked
about a lot and I've also been watching
a lot of best and worst lipstick videos
as I've been doing this video and seeing
what other people are saying too and I
think I have seen that this looks like
mentioned in like I would say at least
85% of videos but math is hard so who
knows what the actual presentation shows
I don't know but these are these
Smashbox always on a liquid lipsticks
these are fantastic liquid lipsticks and
I feel like a lot of people know and a
lot of people are recommending these I
have my shade in stepping out which is
the beautiful brown color that I love so
much and I do also have like a tester
shade of a pink color that I can't
recall the name of it right now but it's
just in like a little pink testing tube
it came from a social a box where you
get like samples of higher-end makeup
been able to try two different colors
and I can confirm that I love this
liquid lipstick and I think is fantastic
this is my most long lasting liquid
lipstick if you want something that's
going to stay on the entire day
it's the smashbox always on liquid
lipsticks they are just fantastic they
really are I absolutely love the shade
and sipping out these are $24 which is a
little bit expensive like the hooter is
$20 and the Kat Von D is $20 so at $24
they are a little bit more pricey but
they are also really good liquid
lipsticks so this formula as well it's
more on the thinner side I don't know I
wouldn't compare it it's not liquidy
like CUDA and it's not just like
straight thin like Kat Von D but it's
not thick like the morphe one it's just
kind of in between all of those not
super mozi but again it's just super
long-lasting and looks really nice on
the lips it does have a different type
of applicator but it's kind of nice how
it comes to that point because you can
really
almost like even like align your lips -
it's just a really really phenomenal
liquid lipstick one that I highly
recommend the last lipstick in my worst
category is from Bronx colors and it is
the legendary lipstick Bronx colors did
send me a package and let me test out a
few of the products and you know I'm so
excited about lipsticks I pulled out the
lipsticks right away to give them a try
and unfortunately I just didn't really
get along with them I'm the shade I
pulled out as an aubergine so first off
with the packaging it's kind of strange
because you have to like click the top
and then the lipstick slides out so when
I first got it I was like how do you and
I'm like trying to twist and trying to
open them in these are what the lips
legs look like and then again the shade
is aubergine which I don't know I mean
I'm sure that you can tell from the
swatch as well hopefully the cameras
kind of picking it up it's not a very
opaque lipstick and again it goes on a
little patchy this shade is darker but I
know I also tried a lighter shade and I
think I just got rid of it right away I
don't even remember these thing in my
lipstick declutter so I just was like
not a fan right away it was like half
lipgloss half regular lipstick it just
does not look very nice and it's also
like very messy I miss out with what
lipstick it you know it is more of like
the cream formula but even still I find
it like getting on to like my chin and
things like that I don't know I just we
just do not get along very well and when
I lift these up on line there 9:54 a
lipstick which I don't think is like
super cheap because you can get these at
Ulta this is considered more of like the
drugstore brand and I find that to be
pretty pricey for drugstore like the one
wild liquid lipstick that I talked about
I think was like four to five dollars
and you know there's good liquid
lipsticks from the drugstore I have the
Jordana liquid lipsticks on my list at
first and those are like $4 those are a
good liquid lipstick so for these to be
950 likes definitely not worth the price
but I was just super super underwhelmed
was at the bronze legendary lipstick so
the final favorite lipstick that I want
to talk about is from Marc Jacobs Beauty
like I said I had a lot on my list and
what I really wanted to do when I was
pulling my favorites was to pull the
ones that I'm
wearing the most that I have a lot of
lipsticks if you haven't seen my
lipstick declutter I'll leave it linked
down below I have a lot of lipsticks I'm
purchasing a lot of lipsticks I get some
packages from brands that send me
lipsticks I'm always feeling like I need
to be trying new lipsticks there is a
handful of lipsticks that I always go
back to sometimes I try to mix it up for
the videos but like when I'm going out
and about I'm constantly grabbing these
lipsticks and the five lipsticks that I
mentioned in this category are the
lipsticks that I'm constantly reaching
for and ever since I got this Marc
Jacobs it is one of the la creme lip
creams ever since I got this I cannot
put this down I think I've born in like
three different videos I'm just obsessed
with this so this is a little sample guy
because it came in with the most recent
Sephora give me some nudes collection
and I am so happy a day because even
though I've been hearing really amazing
things about this lipstick it was not
enough to get me to buy it because it's
Marc Jacobs beauty and it's more
expensive and I'm like I don't know if I
want to do it so this is in the shade
slow burn which is totally my shade and
I absolutely love it and I think it's
beautiful they're full-size it is $30 it
is super expensive to me for a lipstick
this is not a liquid lipstick it's more
of a creamy lipstick so I don't think
that I would have purchased this on my
own had I not gotten this sample and now
I want more because I think they are
fantastic
I would totally pay the $30 price tag
for this and even though that's hard for
me to say I would because I so strongly
love this lipstick what I like about it
too is that even though it's the creamy
lipstick it will say on your list your
list will be pigmented like the shine
will kind of wear way after a while like
if you eat a meal like sure the shine
can kind of go away but your lips are
still going to be that color they're
still going to be pigmented it's still
going to look like you have a lipstick
on and you know of course because it's a
creamy lipstick it's super easy to apply
when I wear this keep by the end of the
day when you wear the regular lipstick
you know it's usually pretty much washed
away when you wash your face it'll just
like wipe right off
I have to take the makeup remover and
actually remove it from my lips at the
end of the day I can't just do the
simple wash off when I could with like a
regular lipstick not this one it has
really good lasting power it's very very
creamy very pigmented very smooth on the
lips I really like it I'm very grateful
it was in that nudes collection because
I seriously don't think I would have
done the $30 price thing I just don't
think that I would have done it but now
that I've tried it I'm a I'm a believer
I'm a believer in the Marc Jacobs Beauty
Lamarck cream lipsticks yeah big
believer big favorite constantly wearing
this okay so that's going to be
everything from my top-five best in
worse lipstick I really hope that you
