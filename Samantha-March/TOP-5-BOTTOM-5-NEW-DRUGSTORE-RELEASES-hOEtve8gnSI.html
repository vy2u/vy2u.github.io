today's video is going to be all about
drugstore makeup I am going to do my top
5 in my bottom 5 of some new drugstore
releases I've been really lucky to get
some new releases lately from brands
like L'Oreal and covergirl Revlon so I
have 10 different products here and I
have them divided up into my top 5 and
bottom 5 I'm going to go through and
give little reviews on each of these
products and explain why I'm choosing
them in the top or bottom category but
if you're ready to talk about some drugs
for makeup why don't we go ahead and get
started already so I'm excited to be
doing a top 5 on 5 I actually asked this
question a really long time ago cuz I
remember I'm pretty sure it was on
snapchat and we all know what happened
is snapchat and I was asking for like
new series ideas and just like new ideas
and things like that but a bunch of
people were saying they really like top
5 on 5 videos so I want to definitely do
more of these and then when I was
getting in so many drugstore packages of
products to be able to test out and
review I thought doing top 5 bonafide
would be a good time to put this into
play especially because I have so many
products that I feel like I might get a
little overwhelmed if I try to put too
many into a video so like for me I can
get long-winded I can get chatty can you
tell right now so I thought doing the
top 5 bottom 5 not only was it requested
but it would maybe like kind of help
keep me on track as well so that is how
I decided it and then I also did a poll
on Twitter because I didn't know if
people liked to see all bottom 5 i'll
top 5 do you want me to go back and
forth and the most requested was to do
bottom 5 first and then do all the top 5
instead of alternating them so that is
the style that i'm going to do but of
course if you have other you know
suggestions go ahead and let me know but
doing it that way won by about like 72%
i would say so that's what we're gonna
do this video already so starting out
with some products that just
unfortunately did not work for me
this one here is from revlon this is
their color stay brow mousse okay so I
am NOT hmm I'm not like super
adventurous with my brows I typically
stick with brow pencils but everyone
smile you know I'll mix it up
something different but this one is
about $12 on the Ulta website and this
is what it looks like so it's a really
interesting little applicator and you
can probably see some of the mousse
that's that's in there from the last
time that I was trying this but you
twist it and the product comes out and
then you kind of spoolie it through and
this didn't really work out for me so
this is interesting because I tried it
the first time and I tried it on bare
brows I didn't have anything in my brows
yet just because I wasn't sure you know
I kind of wanted to see how it went
before you know I take the time to fill
in my brows and then I come in and like
ruin it somehow and when I was doing it
I was like I think maybe I could get it
if I have pretty like like I have
eyebrows you know what I'm saying like
even when I don't have bra product and
them they're pretty deep on theirs I
look probably like medium you know on
the brown scale and I was still like
what does this do is this is this doing
something and I went to the Ulta website
to look it up and just make sure like am
I using this product wrong and it says
it's good for people with medium to full
brows and it's good for covering great
brows and it gives you some structure
and it's supposed to make them look more
natural and then you know they do have
different shades
I was trying this one in blonde so
you're supposed to be able to kind of
but I it just nothing really happens
like I see the product going onto my
brow but when I actually use this
applicator and kind of like do the Shu
Shu Shu
it's nothing's really happening it's
just kind of like moving product in
weird places and that was kind of a
no-go but then I wanted to give it a try
after I'd filled in my bras because I
was like me is it supposed to be like
you know like a brow gel type of thing
and that I really did mess up my brows I
was glad that I was just testing out
makeup that day and I wasn't actually
filming because I would have been pretty
frustrated so I just did like a really
quick fill my brows in and then I went
over and did this and I could tell that
it was moving when I had already done
like it was kind of moving that product
around so I mean this is one where it
definitely could be like user error on
my part because I don't quite understand
this I've never worked with anything
like this I just didn't really get it
but even especially after it moved my
brow product around once it already
filled in my brows
I just did absolutely nothing when I had
no brow product on I was like I don't
understand what this is so unfortunately
this one from Revlon this one was a
no-go for you girl next up I have a
little eye shadow here from all Mae okay
so these are eyes shadow quads from all
mice so here's what one looks like this
one is in the shade 210 unplugged so I
have tried a purple I also tried kind of
a greenish one and then this was the
final one that I wanted to try I was out
of town for a couple days and not
filming and not really like going
anywhere
so that's when I took a lot of the
structure makeup back with me and was
trying it out and then this was the quad
that I chose to take with me cuz I was
like I don't know maybe the colorful
ones aren't work I don't know you know
how they like you try to justify like
make up not working you're like oh no
it's the colorful quads that aren't
working so I'm gonna go with a really
neutral one unfortunately it still
didn't it still didn't work out so so
these run for about $7 and you get the
you know the four little shades in here
and I did some swatches on my hand and
it's probably hard to see them and that
was for me like I was trying to build it
up so you can see them the shimmers in
here they're just not very shimmery so
that was kind of a disappointment when I
put it on my eyes and then I also like
the first time I was using this one in
particular I just put down like a
regular you know eyeshadow primer
nothing crazy and they were completely
completely faded on my eyes in like two
hours or something I put it on and I
worked for a little bit and then the
next time that I went into the bathroom
and I looked my eyes is how it was
holding up I was like where is the
eyeshadow
it helped a little bit putting like a
base on I got these new a Sigma I shadow
base primers to use and I use them the
next day with this one as well but I
honestly think they faded again and what
I was seeing was the Sigma primers
because those are actually really good
these just aren't really doing anything
they're not very pigmented they don't
have a lot of lasting power so I mean
it's only seven dollars for a little
quad but again I've tried the purple a
green one and now this one and that's
kind of they're all kind of working the
same so unfortunately that one was a
Miss from all Mei
next up here I have a product from
L'Oreal this is the True Match Lumi Glo
ssin Glo ssin okay so glow lotion
clearly here's what it looks like and I
was interested in trying this this one
is in shade 901 which is fair Glo and I
think I have one other shade as well so
I'll try to do a little swatch here on
my hand next of these eyeshadow swatches
so you can kind of get an idea of what
I'm gonna say here like okay see right
there you can see that shimmer right
like you can see that kind of glow but
once you start to actually work it into
your skin like so I put it on and I did
that same thing and I like did like
three swipes and I was like oh okay that
looks pretty cool and then I rubbed it
in the rest of the way and then I was
like oh it's it's where where did that
go it's basically gone and I was like
maybe again could be user error because
I don't use products like this a ton as
well so it's just kind of one of those
products that really just fade into
nothing once I started to blend it into
my skin I noticed no difference with it
there was no glow to it no anything like
that so unfortunately this one was a
Miss and I was also testing out a
different one from a different drugstore
brand I'm still kind of trying it out
because this was the first one I went to
now I'm trying out another product
that's similar to this and you can
actually see like even when I don't put
on foundation you can see the glow that
it's giving my skin when I blend it all
in as well so I think I like it so I
don't really like this product either so
this is just supposed to be a natural
glow enhancer but I didn't really I
don't really see that happening are $15
and I just I really want to be able to
recommend this so next up I have a
product here from a pixie beauty and
pixie beauty kind of confuses me because
at least when I first started watching
YouTube and hearing about pixie people
categorize them as a drugstore brand
because you can also find pixie Beauty
at Target but a lot of their prices are
pretty high and then you hear people say
you know there are drugstore brands but
their higher price and so I'm like I
don't know I feel like they're just more
like that mid-range brand so I don't
know if I'm kind of cheating here but I
did get a pretty large PR package from
pixie with our new pixie
and I'm trying to work in the reviews as
I can and because some people still say
drove stir because you can't find it at
Target I'm gonna go ahead and include it
in here and this isn't to me like the
highest priced item that I'm talking
about from that collection so I feel
like we're just gonna go ahead and roll
with it okay but this is the pixie
beauty in collaboration with Whaley
along I'm sure I am saying that
incorrectly but this is one of their
collaborations the entire pixie pretties
is collapse with Beauty influencers so
this is what the eyeshadow palette looks
like it's called let's talk eyes so you
have six different shades here matte and
shimmers and this one is $20 but it also
comes with a double ended liner so if
you were to buy this it comes in the set
so that's why I honestly don't think
about $20 for this and the liner is all
that terrible I'm still testing out the
liner to review the shimmers in here
don't show up on your eyes I don't know
I don't know what else just say and I
was really disappointed because I pulled
this out the other day to use it and I
ended up having to give up and grab I
grabbed up the persona identity pellet
to finish off my eye like it when I used
the mats from this palette but the
shimmers just do nothing now here are
the swatches of the three shimmers and
honestly I don't think that they swatch
that I was excited for that but
unfortunately on the eyes no matter what
of what I was when I was doing the most
recent eye look I even had concealer
down because I've been finding doing
concealer like the cut crease method
type of thing is helping to shimmers pop
more I even did that and I first tried
this shade right here and nothing was
happening and I was like okay that's
weird and then I moved up moved over to
this shade I was like I'll just use a
different shade then and again same
thing I had to stop I had to grab out
another palette the maps are pretty
light in here as well they're not very
pigmented and you do like when I was
working with them just the other day I
actually used just these two the two
Center ones right here for that I look
and you just have to take your time and
build them up I don't really mind that
though with these like matte shades in
particular like Brown transition crease
shades I don't mind that because it's
easier for me to to start little and
work my way up when it comes to to match
since instead of them being too
pigmented and I can't blend them out and
you know all that jazz so when I first
started using this palette and I was
using the mattes I wasn't mad at it but
then once I started to try to add in the
shimmers I was like oh oh no and so I
was pretty frustrated when I couldn't
even finish off an eye look with just
one shimmer from this palette and then
to have two shimmers Network from this
palette I was pretty disappointed so for
$20 I don't think that this would be
worth it but I'm so bummed about that
but no I just can't recommend it already
one more product and this one I don't
think it's necessarily like totally
terrible type of thing but if I had to
pick between top five and five five I'd
put it in the bottom five this is from a
covergirl this is their peacock a flare
mascara I feel like I was hearing really
good things about this mascara so when I
got it in the pr package I was like yes
can't wait to try this one and I'm not
even a mascara person so also keep that
in mind I typically wear false lashes
but every once in a while you know you
find a hidden gem drugstore mascara that
you want to keep it repurchasing so I
was excited to test this out but
unfortunately this just did really
nothing for me it definitely didn't do
anything for volume so if you're someone
who maybe you have long lashes but you
really need a lot of volume this really
did nothing in that category it like
lengthened him like in like a you know
what I'm saying is what they did for
length the worst mascara that I've ever
tried but it's also not something that
like if I'm not wearing lashes that I
would reach for this because it just
doesn't do enough for my lashes but I
have very tiny lashes they have no
length they have no volume to them they
have no nothing and this one just didn't
do them any sort of favors so the
covergirl mascara is nine dollars but
mmm unfortunately this one this one
wasn't missed for me but that is
everything for the bottom five for my
new drugstore releases ELISA and that's
on a happy note and talked about some of
my faves so first up let's talk about an
item that really surprised me really
caught me off guard so I got a really
nice a PR package from Alma you know
we've already seen I put one in my
bottom five but this one has to go in my
top five and I'm
surprise for a variety of different
reasons I feel like Alma is a brand that
has been pretty under the radar for many
many years now they just haven't really
been coming out with any like newer
exciting releases they've just been kind
of like you know I'm not sure this is
what my sound effects as of right now
but I got a package and I start trying
on a few things from them and for some
reason this caught my attention why I
don't know but it did this is the on my
instant glow highlighting duo so I'm
saying that I don't know why it caught
my attention because I don't prefer
highlights like this so you have a stick
highlight on one end and then on the
other end you have a liquid highlight
that looks like such I prefer powder
highlights
I don't like liquid highlights I'm not a
fan of cream highlights so why in the
world this caught my attention and I was
like I need to try this I have no idea
but Wow am I so glad I did it's the
highlight that I have on today and I
really really like this highlight and
I'm really excited about that so this
isn't something and this is the shade
talk pinky to me well isn't that cute
this is something that I feel like gives
more of a natural style of glow so if
you want something that is super
blinding which is normally what I go for
normally that's of what I want with my
highlight but there's also times where I
do want something a little bit more on
the natural side and this I think is
natural but like with a boost I just
think it's so pretty I like the little
pinky sheen to it it's nothing too
overwhelming that's not like too pink on
my cheeks or anything like that but what
I do is like I said I do have it on
today I've just been running my finger
over the stick side and then dotting it
on to my skin and then I've been taking
the liquid side and I'm basically just
dotting it right over where I put the
stick foundation and then I'm just
grabbing a damp Beauty Blender and
blending it out what I really appreciate
about the liquid side of this is that it
doesn't dry immediately on the skin I
recently reviewed the new liquid
highlights from the balm and I actually
tried him out in a first impression
video and it's like you have to dot it
on while already you're there ready
blended out otherwise it's drying and it
like dries and like patches on your skin
this one I mean of course I do work
quickly but I can dot it dot it dot it I
can come back I can close the cap on it
grab my sponge and then start to blend
it out and I can still blend it out like
seamlessly it looks good it looks blend
it into the skin it looks natural it's
like this glow from within man I'm
really excited about this when I was out
of town for the couple of days I
actually brought another highlighter to
test out but I ended up using those
again the next day I was so excited and
I've been wearing this like crazy I
don't know what it is I just oh man I
just feel like it looks really good on
the skin and sometimes with certain
powder highlights you kind of come into
like is it - pottery is it going to show
too much too much texture and again I
just feel like this is a really natural
really pretty highlight so hey I have
been really excited
these are $12 yes these are $12 for the
duo so this is your kind of thing and
you like the natural highlight I think
that you would really like that one next
up here this is from Revlon this is the
a photo-ready prep set and refresh I'm
not exactly sure how new this is because
I feel like I've seen this before but it
did come in a recent package that I did
get from Revlon so I thought I would
throw it in here to review it so this
guy is $13 I think that's kind of pricey
for a drugstore spray but that could
just be me but I actually really do like
this one and spray on it is oh that's a
nice that's a nice fine spray that
you're getting but this one actually
when I spray it I feel like I don't know
how to describe it the best but it's
like one of those things where you just
know that it's doing something for you
and it's almost like it doesn't leave my
skin like sticky but I can feel that
like I feel like it's making my makeup
last and again this is what I wore or
this is what I brought with me out of
town and I used it for the couple days
and I felt like my face makeup was
holding up really well and this is one
even after my testing period I keep
reaching for this one just because I
feel like it's doing a really good job
of setting my makeup in place so I'm
actually really impressed with this one
I like the sprayer on it I feel like I'm
seeing good results with it so this one
from Revlon that had me impressed
next up I have a foundation to talk
about this one is from a physician's
formula and this is the healthy
foundation
I feel like this foundation is getting a
lot of good feedback and I would have to
agree my friend Candace did send this
one to me she got it in the shade M and
three and she was like you know the
shape match isn't great for me would you
like me to send it to you and you can
try it out for review and I was like yes
that would be great
so one thing I'll say I am someone who
films almost every single day because I
put out a video six or seven days a week
so sometimes I have to be testing makeup
that doesn't necessarily work for me
that isn't necessarily a good product
and you can tell that it's on my face
but a lot of times when I'm testing out
foundation the shade match isn't always
perfect maybe I got it sent to me in pur
and they didn't send a shade match maybe
a friend sent it to me it's not a shade
match maybe I picked it out and it's not
a great shade match but I'm still trying
to review it so cuz sometimes I get
comments like oh girl just wanted to let
you know your foundation doesn't matter
oh I know that most of the time most the
time I know that and I can see that but
I'm still just trying to review and
because I film almost every single day I
don't have a lot of downtime to be
testing makeup alone that on camera I
hope that makes sense both say like
whenever I was wearing this foundation
so many people are like that foundation
is too yellow for you it's too yellow
I'm like I know just let me review it
though let me test out man but I will
say that I actually really do like it so
it has the applicator kind of like the
Clinique beyond perfecting which I don't
mind I don't hate I don't think it's my
favorite way for foundation application
but I don't mind it but I feel like the
finish that it leaves on the skin looks
so nice
it says it has a brightening complex in
here and it's good for all skin types I
really do believe that it just brings a
little bit of like luminosity or
something to the scan but it definitely
does just kind of like brighten the face
up that's something that I definitely
noticed and for the longest time I
didn't notice that it said it right
there in the bottle of the brightening
complex
and when I finally did I was like I knew
it I knew it that's what I was saying
about this foundation so it had me
really excited
I like the packaging of it I like the
glass bottle I think that's really nice
prepositions formula this one is $13 on
the Ulta website which actually I don't
think is terrible
for the one fluid ounce which is
standard because the position physicians
formula can be higher priced but that
wasn't crazy to me I honestly thought it
would be hired I do like the way it
looks on the skin I think it blends out
easily I think it's a really good medium
of coverage without being too heavy too
cakey or anything like that it has SPF
20 in it which is good I have been
hearing a lot of people kind of
complaining about the shade range
because so mn3 is supposed to be medium
neutral 3 and I try to go more neutral
like I try to do a cool tone foundation
if I can or at least a neutral and this
I thought was warm and when a lot of
people were commenting on the foundation
they were saying they thought it was
yellow which usually yellow is in the
form so I was like yeah I'm confused too
a little confused if you guys feel like
you found a good shade match maybe let
me know if you have like a comparison
foundation you could throw at me because
I do want to purchase one in my correct
shade but I don't know how to find it
and you can't swatch at least at my CVS
you can't swatch the drugstore
foundations so I don't know how to
choose one so that's the only downside
to it but I again I really like this
foundation I think it's really nice I
think it'd be a good summer foundation I
just can't find my shade moving on ok so
I have two products left and they're
actually both from covergirl I was so
incredibly lucky to get the giant
covergirl box that I'm sure you're
seeing a lot of people you know open and
haul and review and things like that so
exciting to me because covergirl was one
of the first brands that like I was ever
wearing I can remember those little tiny
single blushes because my mom used to
have so many of them and I'd always wear
them and I bought the covergirl single
eyeshadows for the longest time but to
get a box like that was super
overwhelming so I've been trying out a
lot of different things you know the
mascara didn't work for me but I have
two items here that really do excite me
the first one here is the covergirl
vital is healthy powder okay so I'm not
even a powder girl and when I saw these
I was just kind of like I don't know but
then I believe it was Jessica Braun that
I heard saying really good things about
this powder and I was like you know what
I'll go ahead and give it a try so glad
I did Thank You Jessica
because Wow am I impressed with this
powder I'm trying mine out in the shade
725 which is buff beige and just what
I've been doing so far is when I put a
foundation
I'm just kind of using this to set it
all over my face again it's not a step I
do a ton I typically do it more in the
summer if I'm gonna do it at all I'm
just because I'm outside a lot you know
I can get a little bit sweaty more oily
in the summer that sort of thing but
I've been trying it out and if you check
my description box I always link all of
my makeup down there a lot of times this
is past couple days weeks and whatnot
you keep seeing the covergirl powder
down there because I'm just so impressed
with it I just want to keep wearing it I
am actually trying out a new drugstore
foundation today and it's a mattifying
foundation which normally I don't think
I would really put powder over a matte
foundation but I don't have a lot of
mattifying foundations but I still was
like but I want to put it on it makes my
face look so good so I still did I feel
like I look really weird today like I
feel like I look super matte which is
not normally my style but again review
period we're testing things out seeing
how they go but that was how excited I
was like I still wanted to put the
powder on I just feel like it makes your
skin look so flawless and just so pretty
add something about this powder just
really makes my skin look so nice it's
not too cakey it's not too heavy or
anything like that I just I just feel
like it's making my skin look so good so
even though this is a step that I don't
normally take in my foundation routine I
still just want to keep putting this
powder on because I feel like it really
smooths everything out and just gives my
skin a bit of a lift so I've been really
excited for this powder and this powder
is $12 that's actually kind of pricey
for a covergirl but if you're a big
powder person powder foundation person I
would check that one out and then the
item that has me the most excited and
you guys might think this is crazy
it's a brow product it's a breath a
pencil it's a brow pencil I'm so excited
over this a covergirl brow pencil it is
the ultra fine brow pencil and I have
mine in the shade a soft blonde it's
what I have in my brows today it's what
I've been wearing in my brows so
frequently because I feel like my brows
I should look really good when I use
this pencil and that has me pretty
stoked this is only eight dollars which
I don't think is bad at all but I'm just
so excited to find a balm drugstore
pencil for my brows because I feel like
for the longest time I was really
struggling I was only able to use the
benefit brow pencils but this eye this
a good one this one and the Maybelline
brow definer those are like head-to-head
right now with my favorite drugstore
pencils and just favorite drugstore
pencils in general so this one has a
very fine tip on it you probably could
catch that from the name so is an
ultrafine tip reminds me of the benefit
precisely my brow sort of thing and it
has the spoolie on the other end regular
old spoolie over here but something
about this pencil it just allows me to
create like really fine hair strokes I
typically struggle for the front of my
brows because I don't have a lot of hair
that grows like towards the front of my
brow so I try to fill that in the best I
can with a pencil and sometimes it's
hard and I it doesn't always look the
best on me like sometimes it's like too
smudgy or something but with how fine
this pencil is I feel like I'm doing a
better job of actually creating hair
strokes but it still fills everything in
really nicely I don't have to take too
much time on it and I've been getting a
lot of compliments on my brows
especially when I've been wearing this
brow pencil
I'm just so hyped over this pencil it is
what I have been reaching for so much
it's so easy to use I'm so excited about
that so covergirl oh man you and me this
brow pencil we're gonna get along just
fine
I'm totally gonna be repurchasing this
one when I run out of it because I'm
loving the way my brows look after that
