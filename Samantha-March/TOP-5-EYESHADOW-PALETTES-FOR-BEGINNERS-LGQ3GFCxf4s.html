today's video is going to be my five
icicle pellets that I recommend for
beginners I saw this video requested
about a month ago I'm writing down all
your video requests and just working my
way through them as quickly as I can but
I saw this one come in probably about
last month that someone requested me to
do this video so that is exactly what
I'm going to do today I'm going to share
5 eyeshadow palettes that I think work
for beginners and explain my reasons why
before we get started I do want to say
thank you so much for clicking on this
video I am currently posting a video
every single day so if you enjoy giving
daily content on makeup and beauty I
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button before you leave but if
you would like to see my five eyes
shadow palette recommendations for
beginners when we go ahead and get
started so I decided to do this video I
know this video has has been floating
around for you know probably ever the
idea because a subscriber asked me to do
it so that's why I put it on my list but
how I decided to do my video was
basically to take some of my first
palettes that I bought when I was still
very much a beginner I totally still
consider myself a makeup beginner 100%
but these are the eyeshadow palettes
that I bought for myself when I was
either haven't even started my youtube
channel yet or I just started my youtube
channel and the ones that worked the
best for me because I had a pretty a
pretty solid pile of eyeshadows and an
eyeshadow palette from when I was more
of a beginner and then I picked out the
5 favorites that I would really
recommend and that really worked for me
so that's how I decided to do this video
so the first one that I picked out is
from a wet and wild this is their silent
disco palette so this is what this one
looks like so you have these three
different shades in here I remember I
got mine from Walgreens I want to say
it's like 4 or 5 dollars but their trio
are super super inexpensive I know a lot
of people recommend the wet wild trios I
think walking on eggshells is one that
is very very popular as well I never did
get that one for myself but I really
liked silent disco and the reason that I
feel like I liked this little trio here
so much was because it actually helped
me understand how to create a smoky eye
you can see from the shades and here you
have like your darker colors here and
then
your color that's exactly how I learned
how to do my smokey eyes and if you can
see its kind of let's press into the
eyeshadow but this top one says bra long
the second one says crease and then the
other one says eyelid that one is like
almost completely gone I almost couldn't
read that and that was also really
helpful to me as a beginner and that is
exactly what I did I put this in the
crease and kind of in my outer V I put
this one all over the lid I would put
this one in the brow bottom and also on
the inner part of my eyes kind of helps
link lighten the look up so it wasn't
too dark on me but this is the palette
that I used to try to help me create
smoky eyes and it's really what helped
me and it was super inexpensive it was
super affordable the shadows are really
really good that fly is back are you
kidding me right now are you kidding me
I do not see that fly unless I'm filming
also just think the shadows are really
nice I still reach for this palette I
have still used this palette recently I
loved that brow bone color so much as
though it was so pretty and this eyelid
shade all I mean I'll just go ahead and
do a swatch of that one but I loved that
shadow I thought it was so pretty but
this is one of my first eyeshadow
palettes it's from what in wild it's
affordable it's easy to use and I would
definitely recommend silent treatment
now that my first eyeshadow palette that
I bought that was really based off of
YouTube of recommendations and I
remember I was so excited when I bought
this palette and I felt like that was
like in some sort of club or something
like not like clubbing but like YouTube
Club you know what I mean it was from
morphe brushes heard so many people
recommending morphe brushes when i first
started really watching youtube and i
actually ordered from morphe before i
have a youtube channel which was kind of
fun because i watched youtube videos for
a while before i decided to start making
my own videos and i purchased from
morphe brushes and this was my first
eyeshadow palette that i purchased from
them and it was the 35 t now really
there's a lot of different working
eyeshadow palettes that I could
recommend to you I really like this
revival some of their newer palaces 35
are I highly recommend if you can get
your hands on the dress and Hill palette
I would say do it but this is the first
eyeshadow palette that I personally
bought from morphe brushes and one of my
first eyeshadow palettes in general it
worked out so well for me I don't know
if you can tell how beautiful it is but
it is seriously beat
there are so many different shades like
I'm trying to think there is there has
to be even though there's 35 chains in
here there has to be a less a less
amount of shades that I haven't tried
versus how many I have tried because I
have gone through so many of these so
when I got this you know obviously I was
a beginner but I didn't have the makeup
collection that I have now so this is
one that I just kept reaching for and
kept reaching for I thought the maths in
here were so beautiful and they were
very like workable for beginners as well
these kind of like light brown
transition shades these beautiful mauve
shades that we have like yes you have
like your deeper colors down here if you
want to do something more dramatic but
then all of these beautiful shimmers
like it was just so easy to come into
this palette and create an eye look also
the palette obviously has a theme it's
more of that taupe theme and then it has
these beautiful goals and these
beautiful mop it was really easy for
someone like me who I am NOT
artistically creative I can't look at a
palette and just come up with all these
bomb makeup look I'm super basic when it
comes to my makeup look because I just
don't have that eye for art I don't have
that eye for creativity like makeup
artists feel like I could never be a
makeup artist because I just I just
don't have that in me but this was
really easy to look at and still create
really beautiful looks I bought a less
of the morphe actual house because I
really do like them but the 35 t is what
I started out with so if you like that
color scheme like if those are your
colors I highly recommend this palette
it's 2299 and you get 35 different
eyeshadows and I think that is a really
good price and as a beginner this was
one of my absolute favorite palettes so
I have a non traditional eyeshadow
palette but I can remember placing my
first makeup geek order as a beginner
and being so excited when my order came
in I can actually remember what I was
doing the night that my makeup geek
order came in I was going to an I Cubs
baseball game and I was like hold on
wait I need to take my makeup off and I
want to play with these eyeshadows
because I was so excited about them like
isn't that random how you can remember
things like that but I started buying
from the makeup geek before I had my
channel this was totally a
recommendation off Jaclyn hill I sat
there and I watched her video about
makeup geek and I wrote down all of her
favorites I think I started off buying
for originally and then I
a couple more and then I actually just a
couple months ago I got a package from
makeup geek which is like super
overwhelming so then I even add it some
more
like these two on the bottom here you
can tell these are my newest ones that
they look nice and everything else kind
of like looks like it's been abused of
it but the first shadows that I bought
was this one right here which is Peach
Smoothie
this one is creme brulee this one is
cocoa bear and this one is shimma shimma
like these four right here as a beginner
this is what I use and I use them I use
them hard peach smoothie creme brulee
Coco bear shimma shimma those are the
four makeup geek eyeshadows that I would
recommend to a beginner because those
are what I use on my eyes all of the
time I would comment first with Peach
Smoothie I would either lay it as a base
over my eyelid primer or I would put it
into my crease then I would come in with
creme brulee that would go into my
crease then I'd come in with Coco bear
and I would put that on the outer V of
my eye and then I would put shimmer
shimmer all over my eye and sometimes I
did brow bone inner corner highlight but
not too much when I was a beginner and
then I would mix creme brulee and Coco
bear for my lower lash line so that was
my eye look all of the time like so
often that is what I was reaching for so
I really wanted to mention my makeup
geek shadows because they were really
special to me as a beginner like I said
I can vividly remember getting them I
can remember what I did that night I can
remember washing off my makeup so I
could put these eyeshadows on because
that's how excited I was over them so
right now to make a shadow pans are six
dollars a piece I think they're their
prices have started to go up but they
are really good eyeshadows and you
definitely hear a ton of people
recommending makeup date there's so many
you know my favorite makeup geek
eyeshadow videos so many people have
huge V pallets full of the makeup geek
single shadows and I do I just I
remember these as a beginner I would
totally recommend them really enjoy them
and those four shades are definitely in
my favorite from makeup geek so the last
develops I have our more high-end Palace
but these are what i also bought as a
beginner and i would still recommend
them even with a bit of a higher price
so the first one is going to be the
tartlet and bloom palette from Tarte
cosmetics so this is what the
Packaging looks like I know I've
mentioned this eyeshadow palette and a
lot of past video but here is what the
inside looks like it does come with a
mirror and then it has all of these a
beautiful and neutral shadow to me as a
beginner that's what I really need it
feel really hard for me to play with
color and like I said because I'm not
like super artistically creative it's
it's hard for me to do really colorful
and you know crazy makeup looks it's
just it's just not my personal makeup
vibe it's not what I'm most comfortable
with so pallets like these really do
help me out I just find these shadows
very easy to work with out of these
beautiful neutrals right here especially
are so pretty
the shimmers are super easy to work with
as well I honestly don't come into the
3rd row assignment sometimes for like
lower lash works but especially these
first three rows like all of those
shades in there I just think are so good
and so pretty so easy to work with very
pigmented but without going overboard
like they look very are super pigmented
yet you can still build it up and I feel
like that's what's kind of important as
a beginner because sometimes if
something is too pigmented and you come
in and you place it on your eye right
away if you're not super skilled at
blending or if you don't have great
blending brushes which as a beginner
that will totally be it's really hard to
work with it if it's if it's going to be
that pigmented so these while they are
nice and pigmented they're not overly
and you can still build them up which I
do think is important as a beginner and
then if these beautiful shimmer shades
that we have in there like that's kind
of my go-to look a crease color and
outer V corner and then a shimmer on the
inner part of my lid so this was a
palette that I reached for a lot it does
have a nice mirror I just really liked
all of these neutral shades in here it
is $46 but I would still recommend it if
you want to splurge on a high-end
palette as a beginner one really good
one to check out is the tartlet and
bloom and then my favorite high-end
pellet that I would recommend for
beginners and the final palette that I'm
going to recommend is of course the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette if you
guys have been following my channel for
a while I think that you probably
suspected that I was going to recommend
this one I recommend this eye shadow
palette over and over and over again
when my niece was getting into makeup
and she asked me for recommendations one
of the first ones that I recommended to
her was the Kat Von D shade and light
palette this is something that I truly
do recommend this was one of my fur
higher-end eyeshadow purchases I
actually purchased this one before the
tartlet in bloom this was the first one
that I purchased it was $48 so only 2
dollars more than the Tarte one and I
was really intimidated like really
intimidated I was nervous I was like oh
my gosh I just spent 48 dollars on eye
shadow palette like the wet and wild one
was for like what if I hate it what do I
do what if I can't get it to work for me
and I love it I find this so easy to
work with these shadows are definitely
very pigmented there are more pigmented
than the Tarte one so you just need a
very light hand but they are so easy to
blend out I tap on the eyeshadows at
least in this palette are some of the
easiest shadows to blend they just blend
well they blend well together without
losing their color without losing their
pigmentation they just all work so
easily together and as a beginner it's
really helpful to have a palette like
this where it is separated into quads
that's exactly what I did when I first
got this pellet I worked off of these
four shades and then I worked out with
these four shades and then I finally had
ventured into these four shades because
we have that deeper gray and that black
in there and that took me a while to
work my way up to but this is like
exactly what my eye looks are you know I
put a color into the crease and then I
put a color into the outer V and then I
put this one on the inner part of my eye
and sometimes I even went crazy and put
that one on the inner part of my eye or
is the brow bone highlight that is how I
work out of this palette for a very long
time it has a nice mirror I have
traveled with this thing I think I
mentioned this in my used and abused
because this poor palette has like my
fingernail marks in it everywhere
because it's come everywhere with me
it's dirty but it was one of my absolute
favorites this was such a good first
palette for me like first high-end
palette for me this one was such a win
and I was so happy about that because I
can remember being nervous and it's
funny with this one too I can remember
getting it and we were actually going
out of town to Chicago to a Chicago Cubs
game and I remember bringing this one
with me and I was so excited we were
getting ready in the bathroom together
all the girls Mel's like look I don't
know Ashville palette like I was so
excited about it so funny the memories I
can come up with some of your may
products but I do recommend this one
over and over one of my absolute
favorite pallets to this day I still
reach for it consistently even though I
have had it for two years if not more
now so yes highly recommend the Kat Von
D shade and light palette for a beginner
or really just anyone in general I love
this palette guys that's going to be
everything for my 5 eyeshadow palettes
that I would recommend for beginners I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video or found it helpful in some way of
