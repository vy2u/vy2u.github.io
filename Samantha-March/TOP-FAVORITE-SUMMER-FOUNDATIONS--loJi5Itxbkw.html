today's video is going to be all about
my favorite summer of foundations
I got requested to do this video and
then I did a poll over on my Instagram
stories to see like how much the
interest was in this type of video and
there was so many votes that came in for
it so I wanted to get it on my filming
schedule so I would be going through all
of my favorite foundations that I like
to wear on this summer so if you want to
see what those are let me go ahead and
get started so I'm going to be going
over like some regular liquid
foundations I also have a few powder
foundations and then I also do have a
tinted moisturizer that I want to
mention so kind of in the summer my
preferences are definitely more of a
lighter coverage I am NOT a full
coverage gal to begin with but sometimes
I like a lot of like medium full but in
the summer I definitely see myself with
a light medium type of coverage I also
prefer more of a dewy or a luminous
finish and I still like that in the
summer time even though I can get a
little bit more glowy in the summer I
have normal to dry skin but in the
summer I'm mostly normal but I can get a
little bit dewy at times but I still
prefer dewy foundation over a matte it's
just my personal preference
we happen my makeup what do you guys
think like just just give it to me I was
watching the makeup struggles the other
day and she had a reverse smokey eye on
and she said it made her feel
unapproachable
and I laughed for like 10 minutes after
she said that I thought I was the
funniest thing ever and I was like I
want to try a reverse smokey eye so I
tried it today I've never tried anything
like this and of course it's blue to
likes not even just like a brown river
smokey eye no it's a full-on smokey eye
and I didn't even mean to when I was
putting my lashes on I put the first
lash on and I was like you put that lash
on backwards girl I did so the inner
corners on the outside and the ends are
on the inside but I was like I kind of
like it and I feel like it kind of goes
with the reverse smokey eye you reversed
your lashes those are my vibes today so
you guys didn't let me know how you feel
about it I guess I've never tried
anything like this before but I just
thought it would be something fun to do
so that's what we did today but jumping
into the foundations so one of my
favorites one that I reach for so often
and come
like in my like beach bag with me my
travel bags with me when I'm out and
about in the summer is from Urban Decay
this is the naked skin one and done it
says it's a hybrid complexion Perfector
SPF and it has SPF 20 which i think is
very important if you watch my summer
essentials video I mentioned SPF and
sunscreen so often because it's super
super important to be protecting your
skin
so a lot of times I spend so much time
outdoors in the summer we have a friend
with a boat around the water a lot we'd
like to take areas to the beach so she
can swim a lot
we're on walk hiking all of that so I
always want to have SPF on my face have
it in my skincare routine because I
think it's important but a lot of times
my foundations or my powders will also
have SPF in there so this one does have
SPF 20 and I'm trying to think so it
doesn't say it on here but online and
how people were kind of reviewing it is
that they were saying it's a really
light coverage and a lot of people were
saying it's not even really a foundation
it's kind of like a tinted moisturizer
mixed with like a BB cream a type of
thing I find it to be more foundation
like it does give a nice light medium
coverage you can use a Beauty Blender
and kind of share it out so it's more of
a light coverage but I think it gives
more coverage than a tinted moisturizer
and I think it gives more coverage than
the BB cream so to me it's more
foundation base but it's just supposed
to be a really natural coverage for your
skin and just kind of blur everything
out and just make your skin obviously
look a little bit nicer what we want in
our foundations and I agree with that
but I really do enjoy how lightweight it
is on the skin and I like that really
natural look to my skin but I also like
that I can kind of build it up a bit and
you know especially if I have any areas
that I'm trying to cover up I can still
use it for less so this one has a pump
here I have the shade medium which I
can't find I know I just took it out of
town with me but I thought I'd unpacked
my bag all the way but I'm gonna have to
go check but I also have medium light so
those are kind of two shades that I go
back and forth from but medium is the
one that I use mostly in the summertime
so I am a little bit tanner but I do
have medium light as well but I really
really enjoyed this guy one of my
favorite favorite favorite summer
foundations I know this video is all
about my favorite summer foundations but
this one's like really really one of my
favorites this is from L'Oreal it's the
true Match Lumi foundation it is what
I'm wearing today and I love this
foundation I ran out of it I think it
was like towards the late summer last
year early fall or something like that
and I constantly was saying I'm gonna
repurchase it I'm gonna repurchase it I
was saying I wanted to get through some
of my foundations which is super super
hard to get through a foundation it
really is and I never made it through
one which was a bummer but I still
bought it anyways because I was like
this is one of my favorite summer
foundations so I wasn't necessarily
upset that I wasn't getting it in the
winter even though I do still like it
for the colder months but especially for
the summer this is one of like my number
one one or two top worn foundations
because I think it is so beautiful so
again this has SPF 20 now surprise
this shade that I have is in n4 or buffa
beige so it's neutral for and I just
love it it's from the drugstore it's
nice and affordable it does have a pump
on it as well which I think it's great
what it does it gives that natural
finish to your skin but luminous at the
same time so it just gives you it's not
too much so and I think that's why I
like it for summer because a lot of
times if I'm outside by the end of the
day I'm definitely more on the luminous
side so I don't want anything that's
like too too much - glowy for me like
the Loreal Pro globe that's really
really glowy on me so that didn't that
didn't make it into my favorites video
because by the end of the day I'm having
to powder quite a bit this one is like
the perfect amount of luminosity to my
skin it has a great medium coverage I
think and I feel like it's very very
long lasting this is probably my
favorite drugstore foundation but
especially for the summer I absolutely
love this guy
I had to have it in my collection okay
so another guy that I really really
enjoy for the summertime is from Anasazi
Beverly Hills and this is the stick
foundation I have the shade natural yes
natural I have the shade natural and
this was a foundation that I went back
and forth on it for the longest time
because at first I was like I really
don't think I like this it was so so
light coverage and I think I want to say
when it came out or at least when I
bought it but I can't remember if it was
right at the release but I want to say
it was more towards the winter colder
months where I'm more
it's like my medium-full coverage
routine and this one was just too light
coverage for my house like I don't
really like it I'm not a huge fan of
stick foundations to begin with but this
is one of the very few stick foundations
that I've tried that I do like for the
summertime again in the winter I'm just
not a huge fan of it in the summer I
like how light covered just how light
coverage it is you do with stick
foundations I think one thing that I
don't like is I feel like you have to
like use so much and you have to cover
your whole face you know what the
regular foundation I'm used to just
doing a few pumps and like putting a few
dots on and then blending it all
together with this it's like you have to
really take your time and cover your
whole face and what this it's still
you're doing that and you're using so
much foundation it seems like and you're
still getting such a light coverage so
that I'm like ah but again in the summer
time I lean towards light coverage
especially if I'm going to be outside
for a long time I don't want anything
too heavy or too cakey on my skin and
that is when I reach for this I also
enjoy this for traveling especially if
I'm doing something more vacation esque
even if it's just you know we're going
camping I don't like camping but somehow
we go every single freaking deer but a
lot of times I bring this for things
like that because I've still want to
have a little bit of coverage I still
want my skin smooth out a little bit but
I just don't want anything too heavy on
me and that's when I come in with the
Anasazi istic foundation so I reached
for this quite a bit in the warmer
months ok so another foundation that I
love that is super super dirty and I
know towns can't judge me on that yeah
but this is the covergirl vitalist
healthy elixir foundation my shade is in
740 which is a natural beige so it says
it's lightweight full coverage makeup it
also has SPF 20 this is just one of my
favorite foundations this me and if I
had to rank it with that L'Oreal I think
L'Oreal is still going to be number one
I think this is my second favorite
drugstore foundation so it's covergirl
it's drugstore it's a nice affordable
price again it has a pump on it mine is
super messy because I use this all the
freaking time I really enjoyed this in
the winter as well because it does have
more of a I mean it's a solid medium
coverage I think that you can build it
up more towards medium full ish but also
if you don't use this much and you use a
Beauty Blender you can kind of get more
of like a
good again I'm gonna say good salad
medium this one isn't really a very
light coverage to me but I really
enjoyed the coverage on this and like it
says I do think that it's lightweight on
the skin too but I love the finish it
gives because it again it's just really
really natural which I like in my summer
foundations I like my skin to look
natural
I do freckle sometimes in the summer and
I like my freckles to show through
you know snapchats telling us that
freckles are in right now and so I like
I like the natural finish but I like the
coverage that it gives at the same time
so I think this one is really really
good also okay next up another favorite
that I have is from Charlotte Tilbury
this is the light Wonder youth boosting
perfect skin foundation whoo so you can
find a Charlotte Tilbury on the Beauty
lish website there is a rumor that she's
also coming into Sephora I don't know if
that's true yet but I sure hope so
even I love Beauty lish I recommend
Beauty lish if you've never purchase
from them I recommend it I think they're
great so mine is in shade 5 and it says
medium this one I don't think this one
has SPF so I think this is the first one
that doesn't have SPF it doesn't say it
on here anyways the reason why I really
like this foundation is because I do
think it's more of a lighter coverage
this one is kind of what the new cover
FX where you kind of have this squeeze
tube here and doesn't say how much you
get one point for fluid ounces I
remember thinking it was just a little
bit more than the standard one ounce but
it really is it's definitely a
foundation I think on the back here it
says for a daily luminous tint but it's
more of a light coverage foundation you
can also build it up a little bit but
again it's it's a lighter coverage I can
you know my skin can still breathe I'm
not caving on any makeup with it and
again I mean I'm gonna be repeating
myself a lot because these are the
things that I'm looking for in my summer
foundations but it gives a very natural
finish to the skin with just a bit of
luminosity and I think it is so so
pretty this one is one of my favorites
this goes with me a lot I like the
packaging as well it's it's travel from
me also because it is just plastic
packaging and I'm not worrying about it
breaking or anything but this one also a
go to and the last you know kind of
regular liquid foundation that
is one of my favorites for the summer is
from Lancome this is the 10th adult
foundation and I mean if you can see I
have a pretty good dent put in its like
right there like I have a pretty good
debt put into this one and I really
enjoy it this is a foundation that I
will wear all year round and I think
it's phenomenal it's one of my top top
favorite just overall foundations I
think it's fantastic and I recommend it
all the time it is so long wearing it is
so long wearing it's more like a medium
medium to full coverage so I definitely
like to apply it with a Beauty Blender
to kind of get you know kind of bumped
down the coverage just a little bit
since I prefer more of a medium but it's
definitely more medium to full I would
say but it's going to last such a long
time so if I'm doing something in the
summer where I'm leaving the house early
and I know I'm not coming back till
later maybe I won't have any time to do
any sort of touch-ups or anything I will
reach for this foundation because it's
going to last me all day and it's going
to look really good from the time I put
it on the morning from the time I'm
taking it off in the evening this is
just like it's just one of my favorite
foundations
I recommend it wholeheartedly I really
enjoyed this guy but one this is a
pricier foundation one that I think is
really really similar so I wanted to
mention it is from number seven this is
the stay perfect foundation again this
one is more of a good medium coverage I
think you can get a little bit more
coverage with the Lancome but this is
still a solid medium coverage it also
has a pump as well I don't think the
number seven is as long-lasting as the
Lancome the Lancome it says it's this
also has SPF 15 in it the Lancome does
it says up to 24 hour color wear and
comfort transfer resistant foundation
like honestly I believe it I've never
worn it for 24 hours but I have put this
foundation told Burke timewise and I've
been very impressed with it the number
seven also has SPF of 15 in here and I
just the only differences is you get a
little bit less coverage and it's not
quite as long wearing but for the finish
and how it makes your skin look I think
that these are really really similar so
if the link home is just a little bit
out of your price range what you're
looking for a good dupe i would suggest
number seven I did want to recommend two
of my favourite powder foundations as
well sometimes want to have just a
a light a superlight coverage but it's
just evening out my skin a little bit
and maybe I'm covering anything that
needs to be covered so I have two
favorite powder foundations here this
first one is from Pierre this is no
surprise if you guys have been watching
my channel forever I have been
purchasing this for like ten years or
something I started buying it back in
college was that ten years ago what that
hurt everybody this a long time ago and
I've just really never stopped I've gone
through multiple ones of these so this
is the four and one press mineral makeup
again it has SPF 15 in it and I pick up
the shade tan because usually that's I'm
more on the tan side in the summer where
I'm reaching for these a lot more I just
really like the finish that it gives me
we were voting I'll begin and this is
the foundation that came in my bag with
me and what I was putting on again I
really like that it does have the SPF 15
in it as well especially if I'm wearing
you know if what I'm wearing underneath
it what did I wear this weekend oh I
wore the stroke cream underneath and
then I put this on top of it I don't
think the show-up cream has SPF I don't
know that for sure because I just have a
little mini guy but I like that this has
SPF because even though I have my
moisturizer with SPF I like having even
more on just you got to protect your
skin I hate when I get sunburned it
makes me so frustrated so frustrated
okay but then the other powder
foundation that I want to recommend that
this is a drugstore option and I think
it's fabulous this is from Maybelline
and it is the superstay better skin skin
transforming powder and this is I have
the shade 30 which is warm nude it has
salicylic acid in it but I don't think
it has SPF it does not say it does okay
then so this a foundation I also have
tried like the regular foundation that
came with a pump and I really really
like that foundation as well but the
whole point of it and kind of the name
behind better skin is that it does have
the salicylic acid in and it's supposed
to help clear up your skin it's supposed
to help give you better skin I felt like
I noticed that with the regular
foundation and I really want that one
back in my collection as well I don't
notice it as much with this because I
don't wear this on a very consistent
basis but come summertime I probably
will what I usually travel
what I have in my clutch with me when I
go out because I think that the
packaging is really convenient but also
what makes it different from the peer
they both do have a mirror but this one
also comes with kind of this like sponge
applicator which I don't mind especially
when I'm out and about and if I just
need to touch up on in a few spots I
love that I don't have to then put an
extra brush into my bag so that's why
this one usually goes in my in my like
going out bag with me like for going out
at night this is the one that usually
comes in my clutch with me because of
that I also really like this one I just
like how it looks on my skin that like
said that I like that it evens
everything out and just gives me you
know just a bit of a confidence boost I
would say so I also really enjoyed this
powder foundation and then the last one
that I want to talk about is a tinted
moisturizer now I used to wear BB cream
so like crazy tinted moisturizers like
crazy I'm you know several years back
like five seven eight years ago that's
basically what I wore instead of
foundations now I'm more used to wearing
foundations I kind of prefer it just you
know I am 31 you know when I was 19 21
23 like I didn't have as many kind of
like skin issues going on like that I
don't feel like I have a ton at this
point but I feel like now I just prefer
foundations like I don't have as nice of
skin as I did back then you know the
thing but I definitely wore them a ton
but I don't reach for them as much but I
did get a tinted moisturizer sent to me
to try out from number 7 and I've really
been enjoying it so I thought I would
mention it in here this is the airbrush
away it's called the tinted skin
Perfector and it says it's a satin
finish sheer coverage and it's enriched
with skin care benefits I really do like
this guy I have the shade medium it
doesn't appear that this one has SPF in
it either so again it's not a foundation
it's not a like I'm not even gonna say
as a light coverage it really is more
like sheer to light I would say because
it's not like when I put it on I don't
see anything like I can notice a
difference when I put it on but nothing
heavy nothing cakey nothing too
noticeable it just kind of smoothes and
blurs your skin out and it also gives me
just like a bit of like a tint as well
but yeah
to skin perfector I can notice that it's
giving me a bit of a tint as well I
typically like to wear this and then put
a powder over it or like if we're going
boating or if I'm going somewhere in the
water like I'll just
I've just been wearing this I've done
that a couple times too but so far I'm
really lucky I mean I've probably tried
it like four five five or six times I
would say and so far I've been really
impressed with this so I did want to go
ahead and mention that in here so I
think tinted moisturizers can be nice
for summer long hot days days by the
water things like that but after that
case that is going to do it for my
favorite foundations for the summer okay
so that is everything for today's video
I of course will have all of the
foundations that I mentioned linked it
down below let me know if you love any
of these foundations as well for summer
or just any other time in general as
well I would love to know if we have any
of the same favourites I really hope
