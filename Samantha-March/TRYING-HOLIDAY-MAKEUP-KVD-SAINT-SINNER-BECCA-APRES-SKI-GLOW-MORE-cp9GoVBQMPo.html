video I'm so excited for because we're
gonna be testing out some holiday makeup
releases so we are going to be trying
the Kat Von D st. and Center eyes shadow
palette and then for sure we're also
going it to be testing out the Becca a
price key glow a face palette I just got
this in and I'm so excited I have some
other holiday releases sprinkled around
but I've got you know we're just gonna
have to put this look together and then
see what else we need to grab but for
short we're going to using these two
items and I'm really excited to test out
some holiday makeup so if you are ready
why don't we go ahead and get started
since we're not doing a full face I do
have like foundation concealer and then
brows on and then everything else we're
just going to build as I go along
I am so excited were and served the eyes
using the Kat Von D Saint and sinner
palette my friend live from live loves
her makeup she sent this to me as a gift
and I was just like blown away because
like wow wow I will leave a lip stain
I'll link to down below of course I know
I mentioned her all of the time so
hopefully you are following here but if
you're not I will have her link down
below
I haven't even swatch anything yet it's
just been too pretty to put my fingers
and but I really like this kind of olive
shade right here it's called Immaculate
so I think that's kind of what I want to
roll with today first gonna come into
the shade amen which looks like a matte
kind of creamy white shade and I'm just
gonna apply this all over the lid I'm
using a sigma e40 for some concealer aw
holy that's really pigmented oh oh I
should call you zoom you guys in huh and
put yours on I'm just so excited that I
just wanted to hop right in that white
shade was really quite pigmented but
like I said I did put concealer on when
I was doing my like foundation concealer
I put it on my eyes so I'm just going to
apply that all over the lid up to my
eyebrow all right we got the ears on I
got just zoomed in so you can actually
see what the heck it is I'm doing I
really like that shade that's nice
I feel like that's a good indicator when
you have like your matte white shade and
it actually comes out I'll blazing like
that's a good first time for a pallet so
obviously this is gonna be a first
impression on at the Seton Center
palette since like I said
I haven't even likes watched it yet or
anything but I will be doing a review of
you know anything holiday that I pick up
or I get sent anything like that I will
be doing review video so the next shade
I'm going to go into is Maitri are I
think is how you pronounce it it's the
matte Brown and I'm using the Sigma e-40
it's just a big blending brush kind of
looks like a camel Brown and then I'm
going to apply this into the crease
really did like that olive green I
thought it was so pretty and it's funny
because as I'm doing this I'm shopping
for clothes and I have like five olive
things in my cart and I'm like do you
really need that much all of Smith I
like do you that is a really really
pretty
transition shade quite alike it's I'm
gonna do the same thing after my brush
of the palette like what I did that
beautiful orange no like why me like why
so it's trying to decide what shade I
want to come in with next and that you
know I feel like the brush told me which
shade to do I think we are gonna go into
this kind of burnt orange shade which is
called devil I'm gonna use the Sigma e25
and it's funny cuz like speaking of
clothes I also have a bodysuit
the shade in my card as well I'm really
attracted to that but maybe this kind of
like burnt orange and olive maybe will
get kind of like a grungy fall look
going on I'm not not really sure where
this look is going hopefully it turns
out somewhat decent but hey you never
know so because that orange does look
pretty intense I'm just going to Pat it
on the outer part of my eye first before
I start blending each time I pick up
more of that double shade I'm first
going to really Pat it on to the outer
part of my eye and then start to blend
it it's quite a bit of kick up in the
palette especially with the devil shade
you can tell there is quite a bit of
kick up there a little bit with the
brown but double has quite a bit more
but I'm not getting any fallout on my
eye thus far I have no I have no fallout
on my face alrighty so now we're gonna
go into the shade E
kill it immaculate right here it's so
hard like holding this palette up it's
so cute
okay I'm gonna use my Sigma Q 54 it's
the medium sweeper so this one it looks
like it has maybe a bit of a sheen to it
maybe it's like a satin but I'm not 100%
oh that is really really pretty yeah so
it does it has a bit of like a mess and
finish to it I would say that is
gorgeous I have a dry brush I didn't I
didn't spray it or anything
ooh but there's a lot of fallout a lot
of fallout happening let it fall out oh
man oh man oh man okay let me make sure
I have my brush up like like real good
okay so I'll have to dust that away
maybe I should have put some powder down
since I already have my concealer done
but that's okay that's fine
live and learn live and learn normally I
would do my eyes first before I do
foundation but because I'm only testing
you know a certain amount of items I
figured and the essence of saving time
not only being on camera but off camera
I could do some of the face makeup first
that shade is gorgeous I'm loving it I'm
loving loving loving the shade so far I
really enjoy how it looks with the
orange on the outer part of the eye
mm-hmm I'm gonna grab the Sigma e-40 and
then just kind of blend these two
together yeah I really I like that a lot
I think I am gonna do some winged liner
I was trying to decide if I wanted to or
not but I think I'm just gonna do I'm
gonna attempt to do a smallish wing
sometimes when I say small it ends up
very large but we'll just give it a try
I got a new like deluxe eyes sample of
the Kat Von D tattoo liner from one of
my recent Sephora orders and I had
forgotten how much I loved this liner
and how good it is so we got the small
ish wing on another reason I decide to
do a wing is because I am gonna use
lashes that are new to me and sometimes
certain lashes don't look good with no
liner like you need
have a liner down but I'm going to try
out these lashes and also the lash
adhesive from the set from TARDIS called
the man-eater set I don't think this is
necessarily considered holiday but you
know around holiday time companies will
put out sets of like certain items so I
found this one on the alte website I
think it was like 22 dollars I know
mostly for the lashes and eyelash
adhesive because I was curious about
these I always loved lashes and finding
new lashes and then lustre luxe or at
Katy has been like raving about the
Tarte lash adhesive so I thought that I
would give it a shot and see what I
think of it so these are the lashes that
we're going to apply I will need to trim
them in all that good stuff alrighty so
I got my lashes trimmed town and to a
more acceptable length for me so I'm
going to try out this lash adhesive so
it is a brush on tip kind of reminds me
of the house of lashes so I'm just going
to brush a thin layer onto the band and
then let that adhesive dry come in from
the top and then just kind of set it
down I'm using my Tarte lash applicator
which i think is so so helpful for
applying lashes
okay so first lash is on it was pretty
easy to apply the band does seem pretty
thin I will say the lashes feel I don't
know they feel different like not feel
different on my eyes but even just
touching them they feel just strange
they feel different no yet if that's
like a good or bad thing
I like that these have quite a bit of
curl to them that's pretty interesting
they're not like overly dramatic in my
eyes because I can wear some pretty
dramatic lashes so for me they're not
overly dramatic I wouldn't say they're
natural because they do almost reach my
eyebrows so I got both the lashes on so
far so good the lashes almost seemed
kind of like I don't know if I want to
say the word cheap but that's almost
like how they feel which is kind of
interesting I don't know we'll see you
can't judge them too hard on the first
time the adhesive so far seems to be
pretty good but I got to see how they
wear throughout the day you like how the
lashes curl I think that they look nice
and
go back into the palette and finish off
my eyes here before I move on to my face
so I think I'm just going to kind of
mirror what I did on my lash line I'm
first gonna come in with devil and sweep
out on the lower lash line I'm going to
use the Sigma f30 this is a pencil brush
so I'm just going to get this pretty
close to the lash line but I'm also
going to mostly just focus this one on
the outer half of my eye just going to
use the same brush I'm going to come
into immaculate the olive shade and I'm
going to start about halfway in and come
into the inner corner and then just kind
of flick that into the outer part of the
eye close off camera I did apply some
black liner to my waterline and then
also my tight lines for my inner corner
I'm going to take this a top shade up
here it's a white shimmer it's called
absolution this is the Sigma e-40 six
it's called the inner corner brush so
that's what I'm going to use it for so
I'm just going to pop this on to the
inner corner of my eye I notice that
that one even though I just put on the
inner corner that one does have some
like glitter fallout to and then even my
palate if you guys can tell there's like
now like white glitter particles
everywhere so that's kind of interesting
let me just that spit hmm a lot of times
I would do a brow bone highlight but I
don't think I want to with this look I
like the way it looks now and I did
bring that first matte shade all the way
up to my brow so I think that's going to
be good enough I use a little bit of
that maneater mascara up from Tarte
I hear really good things about this one
so I'm excited to give it a try but I'm
just going to apply this on to my lower
lashes to finish off the eyes the eyes
are finished just so next I'm going to
jump into the Becca a pray ski glow face
palette oh I am so excited I talked
about this one in was it my latest
holiday releases video and I said I
really wanted to get it and then a
couple days later I'll take
with the 20% off coupon that you could
use on prestige brands and I was like
well duh
that was a no-brainer so I got this and
I am so excited I saw my friend Liv I
doing swatches on her snapchat and I was
like sold
yes sold me girl so here's what the
palette looks like it is gorgeous but
this mirror is just you emboss
I said in my highlight declutter that I
wanted more Becca highlights and Becca
pellets in general in my collection so
when I saw this I was like yes I want
this so it does have a bronzer shade in
here so called bronze Bondy so I'm gonna
use the Sigma f10 I was a little bit
worried about the bronzer and blush in
here because I wasn't sure if they were
going to be too deep for my particular
skin tone but then when I actually see
them like when I opened the palette up
last night I was like actually that
doesn't really look as dark as I thought
it was going to be I apologize if you
can hear Aries snoring because she's
right next to me just this morning so I
was going in pretty light because I
wasn't sure of that but actually I think
it looks to be a pretty good match for
me I like it so far so I'm gonna use the
blush in the palette which is called
winter berry
okay I'm gonna use my Sigma f40 it's
just an angled brush really pretty again
I wasn't sure if this one would be too
dark on me but I think it looks really
pretty
mmm happy so far oh that bronzer by the
way my camera overheated of course but I
really like that bronzer I was going in
so light handed because I was worried
that it was gonna be too dark but it was
very flattering on me so wahoo
winning winning this palette is $54 so
it was pretty pricey I got the 20% off
which was good and I think I had like
three times points or something in Altis
I was like yes definitely need to get
that so that's all fantastic news but
still $54 is pretty darn pricey but so
far we are looking at so good so I need
to pick out which highlighter i will
swatch these like i
so this is really just like the first
impression video you know trying things
out I will do full reviews on both the
saint and sinner palette and the becca
palette and anything else holiday why's
that I'm getting I will do full review
videos on it but let's just go ahead and
do some swatches and see wow that one
was really pretty and see which
highlight I want to choose a for my look
so here are the four highlights so the
top one is rose quartz and then we have
icicle the next one is blushed copper
and then we have opal blushed copper is
actually a blush I thought it was a
highlight
that's my bad but blush copper is
considered a blush it has quite a bit of
shimmer in it though so it definitely
wouldn't be a blush or a highlight for
me like I could use that one on my eyes
so that's the only one that I don't
think I would get a ton of use out of it
didn't have opal I did declutter it
because it was shattered so it kind of
made me happy because I liked that one a
lot so I'm glad I have it back I'm
trying to decide I think I'm gonna go
with a rose quartz because it looks nice
and pinky I'm gonna use my favorite
highlighting brush which is the Sigma f
o3 this looks so pretty I'm so excited
okay I'm gonna apply that to the
cheekbones oh yes definitely that pinky
highlight that's really pretty
so excited love Becca highlights I think
there are some of like the best
highlights so I'm really excited to have
this palette now and I love a face
palettes I love that I have a bronzer in
here like I enjoy that it's not just a
highlight palette because I think I will
reach into it so much more I love that
shade oh that one was rose quartz I
think that's really pretty
hey I don't think that we have left to
do is a lip color so I did get scented
be a Sigma holiday collection this is
the creme de couture collection from a
sigma beauty and this is everything that
is included in the collection we have an
eye shadow palette and then for liquid
lipsticks I have been testing this out
I've had this one for a while so this
whole collection will be featured in my
first review video that I'm doing but it
is more of a pastel palette and I've
really been going on with this one
really well then we also have before
liquid lipsticks I have tried new mod
already so I kind of want to try a
different color think anything's gonna
be like a really perfect match but you
know we're just testing some new things
out no big deal there right it's just
makeup right though I'm going to use a
foxglove witch Sigma describes as a
bright black berry again that 100% sure
it's gonna go with this list but we're
going to give it a try I did try the new
mod lipstick like I mentioned before and
I was really really happy with it really
impressed with it I'm wearing it in my
holiday makeup releases part 2 video so
I'll have all of my I have three videos
on holiday makeup releases I'll have
those listed down below actually like
this color way more than I thought I
would I don't feel like I have a lot of
color so like this so hmm
I actually don't mind that one so again
that one is foxglove from Sigma a part
of their holiday collection it is
available now and Sigma also just
recently came out with a ton of holiday
scents and a lot of them look really
good especially they have ones like the
sick magic in there or the brush
cleaning gloves they have brush sets in
there as well but over this lipstick so
I just feel like it's different for me
you know it's not nude so it's different
for me okay so so once my lips are done
this is the final look
that we came up with and I have to say
I'm really really happy with this look I
like how everything I came out and I
feel like everything worked really
really well for me and that has me super
excited that doesn't always happen so
afford the saint and sinner palette this
has me way more excited than I thought I
initially was going to be everything
blended out really well for me these two
shades the brown and then the orange
those blended out super easily for me
and I love I thought looked really
beautiful on the eyes even without any
damp brush or anything and went in
really well
I experienced a little bit of fall out
with some of the shades but because I
typically do my eyes before my face that
doesn't bother me so far it's so good
for the Saints inner palettes my review
will be coming soon now I'm just even
more excited to get into this eye
thank you to live this was this was such
a cool gift and I appreciate it so much
I was going to pass over this and now
I'm actually way more pumped for it so
if you guys have been thinking about the
seitan Center palette I hope this little
demo helped you out I know I only used a
few of the shades but that's what I do
when I do first impressions but so far
this is looking so good
a little tart set I didn't mind it all
they have a lot of difference that's
coming out like I said that one I don't
think is necessarily holiday but it is
still available on the Aalto website bar
you know it's my first time trying tart
lashes I think they're okay I'll have to
see I'm kind of a lash snob so we'll see
how they do and how they hold up in all
of that and I'm excited to try that lash
adhesive as well in the man-eater
mascara I'm only used it on my bottom
lashes but it looked pretty good but I'm
excited to try out a couple of those new
items
I'm definitely super hyped over this
Becca palette wow I'm excited to keep
playing with this one I was super happy
with everything that I put on to my face
I'm excited to kind of mix and match
some of these shades and see what I can
come up with the mirror is a bus the
packaging is beautiful so sturdy this is
going to be really easy to travel with
I'm so excited to have another Becca
palette in my collection so far this has
me pretty hyped finally the Sigma
lipsticks like I said look what
lipsticks from Sigma that I've been
trying so far I've been very impressed
with they've been very long-lasting they
do dry very quickly on the lips so my
advice if you go to a sigma lipstick is
to you know apply the bottom layer first
and I typically do two layers even with
this darker one I did a second layer and
then move on to the top lip because if
you do bottom top and then go back to
the bottom it's probably already going
to be dried by then and you might have
some issues there so it does dry very
fast but I think it's very long-lasting
and very comfortable on the lips which
has me very happy and this shade again
it's just like it's like a pop and berry
I don't know if I would normally pick up
a shade like this but I'm pretty happy
with how this one looks on my face and
overall I'm just really excited with how
everything turned out which has me so
happy because like I said that doesn't
always happen with first impressions and
sometimes things can go very very wrong
but I would love to hear what your
thoughts are on the look that I created
the items that I used have you picked up
anything yet that I mentioned in this
video or are you planning on it I'll be
doing still many holiday videos
trying out some more makeup as well and
then reviews I'm going to be trying to
review my butt off for these holiday
releases that I'm buying or that I'm
getting sent because I know there's a
lot out there and I'm excited to be
reviewing everything so stay tuned lots
of holiday is coming up but as always if
you guys do enjoy this video I hope that
you will give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing for
you go and I have a bonus video coming
tomorrow I'm gonna doing a little office
tour so I will see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
