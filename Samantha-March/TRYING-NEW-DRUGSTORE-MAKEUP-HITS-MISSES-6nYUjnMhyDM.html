today's video is going to be all about
trying out some new drugstore makeup I
am so excited I have a bunch of products
here from brands like Maybelline our
Dell elf number 7 soap &amp;amp; Glory a lot of
these are like new to the market items
as well some are a little bit older but
I'm going to be putting everything on my
face for the first time and trying them
out and seeing what we can come up with
so if you are ready to try out some new
drugstore makeup with me when I go ahead
and get started already I do have my
face primed I'm gonna start with my face
because I'm not 100% sure yet what I'm
going to do with the eyes don't have
like a new new foundation but I do have
a tinted moisturizer from number 7 so
we're just gonna go ahead and see how
this works because it's in shade medium
so we'll go ahead and try this and I
have an interesting little set here that
was sent to me from ELF
so this is their silicone blender and
highlighting a sponge duo you know the
silicone blender we've seen a lot of
these a lot of brands are coming out
with them I like this one because it has
a little you know place for your for
your finger back there I don't know if
I've seen I've tried a few different of
these sponges and I've never seen one
like that so I thought that was funny
and it says we have the highlighting
sponge litter in the sponge which is
kind of weirding me out so I wouldn't
use this for all over my face I think
I'm gonna use this today though because
I have a highlight and it's not like a
creamer look what highlight but maybe
for cream or liquid highlights you could
use this but that's interesting but
we're gonna try the little blender guide
today so go ahead and shake up the
tinted moisturizer and hope it's got a
little I've never used this it's got the
plastic on it still I got to peel this
off I do want to say I guess I don't
know you can't see too much lip behind
me we are getting ready to paint my
office which I am super excited about so
what you notice behind me there used to
be shelves behind me we took those off
and then patch to the holes and zoomy in
a little bit more the things that I
don't like the most of all the silicone
blenders are the slapping noises that it
makes on your face makes me very
uncomfortable though the shade does look
pretty dark actually for being medium I
sarcana slowly starting to fade away but
I feel like it's like going on my skin
really blotchy and I don't know that's
the content moisturizer or if it's the
elf sponge just don't feel like my
complexion looks even they see it all
like right here like there's some
product and then there's like not
product let me grab a brush I put some
more product onto a motor brush so yeah
I feel like this is much better with a
brush I don't know what would be causing
that though because like I said I've
used several of those types of sponges
and that's exactly how I use them
so I have it all blended in I think it
looks a much better it is a tinted
moisturizer so it's not you know any
sort of like full coverage foundation I
mean I wouldn't even say it's a medium
coverage you can still see like I have
some redness peeking through in these
areas so I don't have a new concealer
but I'll probably just grab you know a
bit of a more full coverage concealer
I'll go ahead and play one off camera
here but yeah we are painting this
weekend we're starting Saturday slowly
moving everything out of my office and
then we have to move everything back in
reorganize get everything reset up so I
do have to take a couple days off of
filming so I will be pre filming as best
as I can so I don't miss a video but if
you noticed you know like my reverse
chickenpox background it's because we
are in the process of giving my office
it much need it and much awaited for
makeover going to move on and I'm gonna
try out this little guy this is from
soap &amp;amp; Glory it is called the mighty
contour so that's a three-in-one contour
blush and highlight kit it shapes it
shifts it lifts that's what it says I
didn't I didn't just make that up I'm
not that funny
honey so this is what the packaging
looks like oh I thought that would be a
mirror
mm-hmm no go it's cream it's a cream
contour I don't know why I wasn't I
don't know I wasn't expecting cream
under there's the mirror Hey
and then we also have these are creep
Roddick so I don't I realize these are
cream okay so then you have a cream
blush and then is that supposed to be a
highlight as well that's really
I don't know why I thought I would have
to like press really hard but you don't
that's like super soft huh okay so
there's the contour shade that looks
pretty good let's see what the blush is
the same with nails this is not this is
not super easy just so much with nails
well that looks like a very very pink
blush okay and let's try I don't really
know if I get how this is a highlight
how do I spot this I'm gonna swatch it
to my thumb hashtag nail problems
okay wait that actually does look really
pretty sorry that this is like the most
Awkward swatch of life but I don't know
why I like looking at it it looks like a
white cream but actually huh a huge fan
of cream blushes I like her and contour
I don't know um we'll see we'll wait I
actually have a different highlight that
I wanted to use hmm I could put this one
down and then I could do then I'll go in
with the other highlight it might not
match but you know what we're just
trying things out it's you know doesn't
have to be that serious today I mean
hello you guys might see my shirt and
says beach LA official dog of the
coolest people on the planet Vishal
we're not that serious today a
subscriber friend Candice is sent to the
shirt to meet and I immediately like
died put it on right away send it to my
husband it was awesome
so I'm just gonna take again another
Mota brush Charisse is right next to me
and she's snoring so if you hear that
that's area is the medium kit I'm pretty
sure
so the brushes that I typically use to
blend out cream contour are not
considered affordable so I grabbed out
this like little eco tools sponge I got
it in a duo at Target it can see now I'm
starting to wonder if I'm just having
issues with that tinted moisturizer
because as I'm doing this I feel like my
skin is like getting blotchy again I
don't know what it is but I feel like
I'm having these like weird blotchy
patches kind of looking a little bizarre
so I was going to blame the elf sponge
at first
but I don't know now as I'm blending out
the cream contour I'm just noticing all
these weird patches it's just like like
not not doing good things to my skin
that's a bummer though I feel like the
cream contour blended out well and I
still think that you can see that I have
a contour there it wasn't like I started
to blend it and it completely blended
away because that happened sometimes
with some cream products so I think that
still looks pretty good I think I'm
going to I don't have a bronzer I wasn't
going to bronze I think I'm gonna do a
little bit of bronzing off-camera and
just try to I don't know my skin is
looking really weird and blotchy I'm
gonna bronze and see if that helps it
all and then well we'll continue on now
I'm gonna try the cream blush and now
I'm gonna use a morphe m42 7 as a duo
fibre brush so I like it for like cream
products or a lot of like the color pop
super shocked you know blushes and such
I think it's good for those so I'm just
gonna go ahead and Pat it lightly onto
my cheeks at first areas this ring so
loud like I feel like I'm interrupting
her space and she's legit right next to
me hmm
looks pretty good okay so I feel like
that has some decent pigment and like I
don't know even swash I don't know if
you can see the swatch great anymore
because I've kind of been moving around
but it looks like a really like kind of
baby light pink which isn't my favorite
blush color so I was a little little
concerned but I actually like it more
than I thought I was going to nuts
blending out really easily like I said
I'm not a huge fan of cream blushes but
you know look up things a shot I think
that looks pretty good so majority of my
face is done so I'm gonna move on to the
eyes my camera is about too much like
giving me the warning that it's
overheating
so I'm gonna let it cool down at for a
little bit I don't have a new brow
product this time going in to do my
brows off-camera and then once this
cools down we will come back and start
in on the eyes for eyes I have a few
different things to play with I have
these eyeshadow quads from ardell they
are the sensual
in Cabana and then also let's live and
then I got some metallic liners from
Maybelline and I really want to try one
of these they're both pretty like I
don't know if I want to say like
simplistic eyeshadows but I'm thinking
maybe of just doing something really
simple with the shadows and then coming
in with a metallic liner and seeing how
these do I did swatch some of these in a
recent YouTube live video and some of
them had me pretty excited I'm actually
gonna go into this one right here which
is called let's live so our Dell is
coming out with a bunch of new products
here's what that palette looks like
they're coming out with a bunch of new
products and so far I know that you can
get them at Sally Beauty any other links
I can find I'll link them down below but
I don't know if they're gonna go into
anywhere else or like if altas gonna
start carrying some of the other
products that are Dell is coming out
with because they're coming out with
like a big old Beauty line which is
really exciting so I'm gonna go ahead
and try this one first did use when I
put my concealer on I used it as a eye
primer and then I put a translucent
powder over it so I'm first going to
come into this shade or right here it's
kind of a cool toned Brown I'm gonna use
my morphe ta 27 I'm going to put this
into my transition that is actually
pretty pigmented for being you know kind
of a lighter shade let's actually look
and look I'm pretty pigmented and I'm
not gonna lie you guys remember when I
was like oh I'm gonna let my camera cool
down and I'm gonna do my brows it
doesn't happen I got on the computer and
there was an email I had the answer my
mom was needing some return messages
from me and I started getting a
conversation on Twitter so that happened
that's always what happened that's why I
wish I had a camera that I didn't
overheat because a lot of times I'll be
like oh I'm gonna do my brows off camera
I'm gonna pop lashes on and then I start
doing something else and then I
completely forget about it I just wish I
could sit down film and not have to
always stop and go stop and go I think
I'm gonna come in with this first little
shimmer shade here and put it on the lid
I'm gonna use a Real Techniques brush
and I'm not gonna apply any setting
spray or anything first
just kind of oh that's pretty that's
still really pretty though because I
don't want it to be like too too
overpowering because I do want to use
one of the metallic liners and see how
that works but I just wanted a little
bit of shimmer and I thought this one
looked really pretty so that's actually
really darn good for not having any sort
of setting spray down I bet it would be
really you know pretty in metallic if I
did spray my brush try purple I think
that could be really fun I love purple
with green eyes this is called cosmic
purple I realized when I was doing the
light all that you do have to kind of
shake them up and I don't know if you
can hear it on the camera but it's kind
of like a nail polish or it has that
little like ball in there here is what
the applicators look like I'm pretty
nervous about this especially because
when I film I have to hold a mirror I
don't have a mirror I don't have a table
sitting in front of me or anything so I
don't have a mirror to sit in front of
so we're gonna try to apply this very
carefully on camera oh that is purple
Wow I'm gonna try to do maybe a small
wing I don't know this is gonna work but
I'm gonna try to do a little wing here
let's that's not gonna be a small wing
but it's really hard because normally
when I do wing liner I'm kind of like
pulling to make sure everything is tight
so it doesn't skip like this but I don't
have I don't have two hands at this
moment I'd make the wing look as best as
I could
again I really I just I need two hands
when applying a liquid liner so this is
really challenging but I wanted to be
able to try to do it on camera but I'm
getting a good vibe for it anyways even
though I was kind of scared of the
applicator it's actually pretty simple
and I feel like that's really really
pigmented it's a purple metallic I think
that's a very pigmented and pretty I
feel like that wing came out much better
than the other one that one was so easy
huh usually it's my other eye that I
have better luck with but for some
reason that wing came out pretty fast
and simple so hey that's awesome let's
just focus on this eye this is what the
liner looks
actually I'm pretty much digging this
miner I'm not gonna lie about the
applicator would be a lot harder to use
it's really not too bad and I think that
came out pretty darn good my camera's
gonna overheat once again so I'm really
gonna do my brows off-camera now really
gonna do it this time and then we'll
come back to finish off the eyes
remember to actually do my brows this
time and I'm like so hyped over this
liner you guys seriously as I was
off-camera I'm just kind of chill and I
was like oh my gosh I love it I just
wish I could have made this one sharper
like this one but that's that's on me
that's not the liner I'm just I'm not
the best with liner yet and sometimes
one eye is great sometimes one eyes not
so good I finish off the eyes so I'm
gonna grab a pencil brush from morphe
this is the Emma 506 and I think I'm
just gonna mix these two matte shades
together and put them on the lower lash
line I did put a little bit of a color
pop liner on to my waterline called the
cry-baby
and I was actually gonna do lashes
because our delt did send a pair of
their new faux mink lashes like I don't
want to cover this liner because I'm so
hyped about it oh so I'm not gonna do
liner but I do have a new mascara that
we can try a little bit ham on the lower
lash line I for some reason I just I
don't know I guess I didn't realize how
pigmented they would be and especially
this dark color it looks like a deep
brown like actually on the lower lash
line it's more of like a black so that's
a little smokier than I was intending
but that's okay I'm gonna grab a little
bit of the first shade that I use with
my morphe 36 I'm just gonna add a little
bit of sparkle underneath the brow bone
I'm gonna put a little bit on to the
inner corner as well I did notice that
this shimmer shade has you know faded
pretty considerably on my lid so I think
even though it applied you know pretty
decent right off the bat I think it
would benefit from you know some sort of
setting sprays we are gonna skip the
lashes I have this mascara from number 7
and like look how sparkly and amazing it
is this is called the lash impact ultra
instant
false lash vol whoo okay so it looks
like champagne and a mascara so I really
do enjoy number seven they quickly like
shut up on the top of the list of brands
that I recommend and use like I use
something from number seven almost every
single day I've tried their skincare
I've tried their makeup and I thought it
was all awesome here's what the wand
looks like so I'm a little like
disturbed that I didn't like that tinted
moisturizer that's kind of a bummer but
hey you know I really honestly hadn't
found a dud from number seven yet and it
almost was kind of like making me
suspicious because you know no matter
how good brands are they always are
gonna have but done in there so I was
like wait a second number seven we got
we gotta find something that doesn't
work so maybe it's that to dip oyster
oyster you guys don't know I wear
falsies almost every single day I just
love them I love wearing them been
wearing them for years
so mascaras it's really hard for me to
like fall head over heels for a mascara
but holy but that's looking really good
a really good job of lengthening them
but also separating each lash hey I'm
actually impressed huh that doesn't
happen very often eyes are done so I'm
gonna finish off the face now I did get
the Maybelline a master chrome highlight
in molten gold from Maybelline which I
am so hyped for and I really wanted to
use it but then with the soap &amp;amp; Glory
highlight it actually did look really
pretty but I just feel I don't know if
these two would be very flattering with
one another you know can't decide if I
should just put it down but I kind of
want to see how the Maybelline would do
on its own you know I don't really want
to layer it I want to see how it is by
itself so I think I'm gonna save the
soap and glory one for right now because
we did use you know two out of the three
products in here and then I really do
want to try this one and I know when I
did this in the live PR how people were
pretty excited over it this is like a
very hyped up drugstore eye light so
we're just gonna go ahead and use the
Maybelline highlight so I'm going to
my pixie brush of the strobe and sculpt
brush and let's see so excited hurts so
many good things about this highlight
all right whoa okay one thing I'll say
right off the bat is that it didn't
quite give that full oh no okay as the
as you build it up it definitely gains
more intensity but first swipe like I
could definitely still see it but
sometimes you put a highlight on and you
go like this and then that's the
intensity that you get but once you
build it up you really do get that
metallic shine there so I've gone in
three times on each side and that has
made a pretty killer highlight I did
notice that it does kind of show my
pores I have some larger pores
especially over on this side I do and
you can kind of see all of them which is
a bit of a bummer but but it's not too
bad and it's still really pretty and
gold and pop and I think that's pretty
good
I'm so happy I just threw it so don't
know how happy I am it didn't even break
to finish it off I have some lipsticks
here from ardell these are their matte
whipped lipsticks and they sent over the
shades
sizzling sunset and then also upscale
flavor I'm gonna do upscale flavor
because you know more nude and I'm not
sure if this kind of like hot orange
would really match my purple on my eyes
there's what the applicator looks like
on those right off the bat they remind
me of the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipsticks because it is a very very like
thick and Lucy but for me I actually
don't like the anasazi liquid lipsticks
for that reason it just almost feels
like it's too much like it's too thick
on my lips um you know I'll have to wear
it throughout the day and see how it
goes however I think is really beautiful
it's a pretty deep nude actually pretty
good for fall I would say that I feel
like it's dry really quickly and like
this is really weird but it feels like
my lips are super soft like when I press
my lips together it almost feels like a
weight almost feels like I'm wearing a
powder on my lips
see if it's transfer proof I don't know
this it is why that I was thinking when
I saw him that whipped I was like oh it
probably doesn't dry down all of the way
I don't know why that was my first
thought guys honestly it feels like it
feels like I've powdered my lips this is
the most bizarre feeling I've never felt
anything like this ah first impression
you know first impression so you know
take these with a grain of salt but
first impression I'm actually kind of
impressed because I feel like maybe
these will be different than the on
Stassi is because when her lips six
dried down I feel like there's lipstick
on my lips like I feel like it's like
heavy because it's so thick and moussey
and this doesn't feel that way so
hopefully it will be different than the
Augusta's is but I'm curious above these
so the Ardell a matte whipped lipstick I
will be testing this out over the next
few weeks alright guys so after the lips
are done then this a makeup look is
complete testing out some new drugstore
makeup and let me know if you want that
follow-up video because I come back in
about two weeks and follow up on
everything and let you know how
everything has been working for me and
kind of my final reviews and thoughts on
the products because I know sometimes it
can be hard with first impressions but
you guys seem to be liking these videos
where I'm trying out some new makeup so
I thought I could do one all focused on
drugstore and new items at the drugstore
you guys want to see a video like this
using all high-end products let me know
because I've been so lucky to get some
really cool packages from like Charlotte
Tilbury and Burberry and some more
higher end brands so if you want to see
a full face trying high-end makeup
please do let me know in the comments
because I can definitely do that as well
but if you guys did enjoy this video I
hope that you'll give it a thumbs up I
hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you go and I'll catch
you guys tomorrow I got a bonus video
coming for you tomorrow so I will see
you guys then bye
