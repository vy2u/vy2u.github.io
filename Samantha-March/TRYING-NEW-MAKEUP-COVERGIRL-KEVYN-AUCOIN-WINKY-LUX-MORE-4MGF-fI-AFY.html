today's video is going to be a trying
some new makeup so it's not all first
impressions of some of these products I
have tried a little bit but for the most
part they're still pretty new to me
but there are also newer to the market I
thought we could try things on together
so I have this milk makeup watermelon
brightening serum which I'm super
curious about I just got that I'm also
gonna try the covergirl trublend Mac
made foundation you can see the Big Oil
Foundation box behind me I'm super
excited to get this and I really want to
test this out I also have a new a face
palette from morphe this is the 8l or
the low side palette I have a new
eyeshadow palette from Winky lux this is
there coffee palette and then I have
some new blushes from Kevin o Quan that
I wanted to try out as well these are
the Neo boluses that the brand just came
out with so we've left to try out today
so when we go ahead and get started
alrighty so I got my ears on and we are
zoomed in I am gonna do my face first I
feel like I have quite a few face
products and the Winky looks coffee
palette is a very kind of like neutral
kind of like a basic palette I'll say
and so I feel like I'm just gonna do one
of my like a really simple kind of like
my go-to eye looks like I've been doing
here lately so there's not gonna make
too much going on with the eyes so I'm
gonna go ahead and start with the face I
also I really do want to try this out
and I'm very curious about this so this
is the watermelon brightening serum from
milk makeup they did just send me a
package with this in it I'm very excited
about it cuz I've been curious about
this one so this is a $36 product it
says is a brightening and hydrating
solid serum stick that will even skin
tone it will reduce the appearance of
fine lines and revitalize the complexion
of our luminous glowing skin so let's go
ahead and see I do like quite a few of
the milk makeup stick products the
matcha cleanser the toner the original
blur stick I really do like as well the
hydrating oil stick so this is what she
looks like so I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply it all over the face now this
is a serum so it is considered skincare
so normally I wouldn't do it like this
closely to apply my makeup it's probably
just gonna go in my bathroom and be a
part of my skin
care routine but I do want to whoa
there's a while that was not what I was
expecting
but I wanted to try it out on camera so
we could get that first impression that
just happened okay so it feels very
cooling I mean it feels like you're
putting a it feels like you're putting a
liquid onto the skin huh that is super
interesting I don't know why that was
maybe expecting it to be kind of like
the you know what the blur stick or
something maybe but yeah that definitely
feels it feels like a hydrating serum
that's for sure okay so once I have it
on the skin I'm just gonna kind of take
my fingers and blend it out though since
this is a skin care product you know
it's supposed to be something that helps
the skin as you use it with time so just
reading on the Sephora website it says
people noted an increase of brightness
after using it for four weeks more
smoothness was reported also people said
it made their skintone appear more even
the skin texture felt better and the
skin looked younger
that's what gold for so I will just keep
testing this out but like just based off
first impression that was really cool
the way it felt I quite enjoyed that I
don't know if I notice anything like
super crazy right off the bat I do have
tutoring lights on today because we keep
getting like storms and rain and stuff
which is not very fun my face doesn't
feel too sticky or anything like that it
does feel more like I can tell my skin
feels more hydrated again I don't know
if I noticed anything right off the bat
but that is the first time I was using
that product so again I'm just gonna go
ahead and pop that one into my bathroom
and to be able to try it on a regular
basis since the majority of these like I
said some of them I've tried out a
little bit but some will be first
impressions I did a first impression
last Friday as well so I'll come back in
a couple weeks and probably just combine
those two videos and give my reviews on
everything so stay tuned for that
I'm just been kind of hanging out for a
few minutes letting that sink in to the
skin before I move on to my foundation
like I said I'm going to be using it the
new covergirl trublend that Matt made
foundation I did get the big box sent to
me which was super exciting a huge thank
you to covergirl this is very heavy a
huge thank you to covergirl I was so
excited when I
and honestly I mean this is really
freaking cool
let me I'm gonna stand up so I can show
you this is pretty darn cool for a drug
store brand to come out with 40
different shades of foundation I mean
I'm standing it's incredibly hard to
hold this box I think that's pretty cool
we don't see a lot of drugstore brands
putting out so many different shades
Foundation and such a big range so
covergirl I feel like they're doing some
really awesome things lately already so
here is what the foundation looks like
so it's the true blend
Matt made a foundation it's supposed to
be a comfort mat and transfer resistant
with 12-hour wear okay so it doesn't
it's an oil-free formula it does have a
pump which is great so I've just got
this package in the mail yesterday in
the afternoon so I went through and kind
of swatched a few and was trying to find
my best shade without swatching too many
because obviously I'm gonna be doing a
giveaway hang tight
I just got the package I haven't figured
out what I'm gonna do yet but of course
I'm gonna be doing a giveaway with all
these shades because I only wanted to
swatch the ones that I really thought
would work for me because I just would
love to be able to to give some of these
away and let people try out this
foundation as well but I ended up going
with the shade L 90 so the how they
broke it down was light medium tan and
dark and then you have the shades in
each of those ranges so this is the last
lightest shade if that makes sense
before we get to the medium so the l98
into the foundation they also did
release new primers so we have the pore
minimizing primer we also have the color
neutralizing primer which is green we
have an illuminating primer and then a
skin smoothing a primer okay so I just
did the brightening serum which you know
supposed to help with brightening so I'm
gonna pass on the illuminating I don't
really need color neutralizing I don't
deal too much with redness so I'm
between pore minimizing and skin
smoothing my pores don't seem too out of
control today and maybe that was I don't
know if the milk makeup one I don't
remember it saying that it did anything
for pores but they don't look too bad so
I'm gonna go ahead and use the skin
smoothing primer and see how I like that
I feel like my I feel like the serum is
all settled into my skin okay so the
primer feels nice it has a sin
- up but nothing like too overwhelming
feels nice on the skin not to like it's
definitely more of like a silicon-based
primer but it's nothing like - I don't
like it when it's like too too much I'm
so so far so good but I'm gonna go ahead
and put a few pumps onto the sponge I
grabbed out this is a morphe sponge so I
just have my damp sponge here so I'm
just gonna do maybe like three ish pumps
and see how it goes from here so I feel
like it's blending out pretty easily
with the sponge on here the coverage so
far looks to be pretty good as well
stage-managed maybe a little bit light
at this particular moment but usually
once I finish off my face and everything
it all kind of balances out wait so I
zoomed in and I have it all blend it out
on my face so here is what the
foundation it looks like I mean so far I
think it looks pretty good I can
definitely tell that it is more of a
matte foundation it's pulling just like
a little bit dry on me I do have dry
skin normally it's not as bad as it is
during the really cold months but I do
still have drier skin so I kind of
noticed like sometimes with a matte
foundation I just feel like I don't look
as like I just look a little like flat
it's how I would describe a matte
foundation on me and I feel like that's
kind of what this one is doing the
coverage looks to be like a really nice
medium I do have you know a few little
red marks on my face and they covered it
pretty well not fully but I also that's
kind of like the coverage I prefer cuz
then I just come in with a concealer and
kind of hide those as well I'm not a
huge like full full coverage gal so I
like the coverage that it's giving me so
far that looked like it's like clinging
to any of my dry patches like I've been
dealing with some up here on my forehead
as well and sometimes matte foundations
around my nose can not be super cute I
don't notice anything at this time
that's kind of like making me angry
about it so that's good I'll just say
like it's not my favorite finish for a
foundation but I'm going to go ahead and
apply my concealer and my powder because
I don't have any new ones of that and
we'll come back and see how the
Foundation's holding up I went ahead and
applied my nyx concealer i said up the
RCM a powder I did not set my entire
face it's a step that I don't do every
single day I considered it because I
really do love the covergirl healthy
vitalist powder it's one of my favorites
right now but since it's not something I
do normally I decided I wanted to skip
it and see how the foundation worked
through today and also if I'm wearing a
more mattifying foundation I typically
don't like to put powder on it because
then I just feel like I'm too matte and
it's like too much um so that's what I
decided to do I also added just a little
bit of contour because I'm gonna move on
to bronzer I grabbed up this palette
here contour is another stuff that I
don't do every single day I enjoy doing
it I like doing it but I don't
necessarily need to do it but again when
I'm doing something more matte and again
I feel like my face can look kind of
flat I like to add in contour bronzer
highlight just to like hmm you know so I
decided to add a little bit of contour
it's just for makeup forever that's one
one to contour I'm so I will say you
know I've been sitting here for a little
bit and checking it out to me it's
definitely very mad I can tell that my
skin looks mad even without putting a
powder on even using the brightening
serum and you know the smoothing primer
maybe when I try this foundation again
I'll use more of the illuminating or a
hydrating primer and that's a personal
preference for me if you really love
matte foundations I mean so far this has
given me matte foundation vibes and I
like to the coverage on it honestly I
feel like my pores will look really good
right now um could be from the milk
makeup could be from the primer could be
from the foundation but I felt like once
I put the foundation on my pores really
kind of like blurred away which I
appreciate very much the shade metric
again I did l9t I feel like it's looking
pretty good right now it doesn't feel
too heavy on the skin which is another
thing with matte foundations sometimes
it gets too heavy it doesn't feel heavy
at the moment and again still I mean
I've only had it on for maybe 20 minutes
now but I still don't see it like
settling weird into any lines or
anything like that I don't see it
kicking up weird in any spots so so far
so good I don't know if this will be a
personal favorite of mine because I
prefer more of a dewy foundation
but we'll just have to go ahead and see
you never know you never know what
you're gonna like okay so moving on I
want to bronze and I have this new
palette here from morphe this is the
lo-fi 8l palette so inside this is a
pellet looks like so you do have a nice
mirror here and then you have these
eight different shades so you have some
setting powders contour on
contour bronzers highlights so they came
out with the 8 L and also the 8 H the 8
H so this is what the 8 H looks like and
so far I haven't dipped into 8 H so I'm
thinking about maybe putting that one in
the giveaway that I have coming up so
I'm gonna keep working out of the Al I
have used this twice now I've used
bronzer shades and highlight shades out
of this and I'm just like not quite sold
yet so I want to give it another try the
palettes are $25 you can find them on
the morphe site and they are also
available now on Ulta it's $25 I like
that you have the big mirror in here
more fees Reeb and rebranding
repackaging a lot of their items are
including mirrors which i think is great
it feels like a sturdy pallet which is
awesome I will say I couldn't quite
figure out the shade selections in both
and I had a hard time choosing which
palette I thought would be best for me
and I still don't know if I made the
right decision
this literati shade I just I just don't
know what I'm gonna do again I do have
two lights on so it's showing a little
bit lighter but it's almost kind of like
like the color reminds me of like a a
light handle color and I don't know what
for sure I personally would do with that
one I thought maybe donut could be a
contour shade for me this one right down
here but when i swatched and I'll go
ahead and swatch right now when i
swatched these because i was showing
them on my Instagram stories it seemed
like everything pulled more like orangie
so there wasn't like a good like because
look that's not a contour shade for me
so I just I don't know here are the four
so watched out I just don't feel like
out of here I feel like everything's
fairly warm and that's not what I look
for in my contour shade so that's why I
went ahead and did my contour already
because I just think that these are
probably better off as
bronzor shades so literati wouldn't work
for me w times I think it's just gonna
be too dark for me right now that's this
swatch right here and I used enemy the
last time which is right here that's
gonna use this my bronzer and I didn't
quite love it
I don't know let's just try donut I
don't know we'll just give it a shot and
see what it looks like you know we're
just trying new makeup hopefully no one
expects anything like super wild and
crazy here so let's just give it a try
okay I'm already liking that more than I
remember liking enemy so that's a
positive going on very smoothly and I
actually really do like that color okay
why we just had to try again see but I
am pretty happy with the bronzer out of
here I'm glad that I tried it again now
I'm gonna move on to blush and I have
these new blushes from Kevin the Quan
excuse my reach so these are the new
Neel blushes so I have three different
shades here they did send me all four
but I sent one to a friend recently
these are $38 here's what they look like
so they each do have a mirror this one
here is in Sunset which is super
beautiful I'm just like unique to my
collection so I thought that one was
really pretty this next one here is in
Grapevine which is described as a rosy
plum bullish and then the other one that
I have here this one is in pinks and
this one is described as a soft dusty
pink you can see the blush is kind of
have like this fade to them and for some
reason I'm really interested in sunset
which is the bright golden coral I just
feel like I don't have a lot length as
if I collection for some reason it's
like use me use media so I'm gonna go
ahead and try this one out I really do
like that they have mirrors in here
coming up on such a quality brand a lot
of hits for me from that brand some
misses some misses but a lot of hits so
I'm excited to try this out I'm just
going to take my morphe for of course
everything will be linked down below so
I'm just gonna kind of like do that and
see what we get I don't know that's
gonna be fluttering or not but we'll
just go ahead and apply to the cheeks oh
I can tell right away that it is going
to be very pigmented okay okay
definitely
you will need even a lighter hand than I
use so I'm gonna try to go an even
lighter on this side and see how we do
this side definitely better than this I
will have to go ahead and blend this out
this kind of looks like I got a sunburn
this aside I think is very beautiful it
looks very like much more of a natural
rosy glow at to the cheeks so that looks
pretty and it's almost like because
there's just a little bit of like Sheen
shimmer in here it's almost just kind of
giving like a glow from within and I
think that's really pretty so okay let
me go ahead and do something about this
I'm also going to do my brows because my
camera just flash so it's gonna overheat
so I'm gonna work on this side do my
brows and I'll be back by adding my
brows and tried to blend out the blush
as best as I could not really surprised
that you get a lot of pigment like I
said I do like a lot of Kevin of cons
products especially a face products so
not really surprised we can do a lot of
bang for your buck with this blush but I
think it looks really nice I think it
just gives a nice kind of rosy glow
maybe a little bit rosier than the
normal I still think that it looks
pretty nice these are pricey little guys
but I also like that you get kind of the
different colors and there you can kind
of like make your old little creation
with each one but I'm gonna move on to
the eyes so I have this palette here
from winkie luxe this is the coffee
palette so it's $25 and you can also
find it on the alte website and this is
what the inside of the palette looks
like so it's the cardboard packaging
there is no mirror on it and then you
have these nine different shades in here
so it is coffee scented as well as
shunted it is coffee scented and it says
it features every neutral shuttle you'll
ever need like ever no it really says
that so it's nine shades and mattes and
shimmer finishes that will take you from
a cup of Morning Joe to an after-dinner
espresso so it does have a coffee scent
but it's not too overwhelming I've tried
the coffee bronzer from a Winky Lux that
came out in this collection and the step
was just too overwhelming not only as I
was applying it but I could even smell
it on my face afterwards and if you're
not a big fan of the way coffee smells
like I am you're not gonna like that I
mean I can definitely smell it from here
it's not too overwhelming and I have
just a little bit on my eyes is so far
and I couldn't thankfully couldn't smell
it on my face after that but I'm not
kidding once I put the bronzer on I
could still smell coffee which was kind
of crazy I'm so like I said I've just
kind of casually dipped into this
palette so far nothing too serious so
I'm just gonna go ahead and give it a
try I'm gonna pick up this first shade
here I did a find my concealer to my
eyelids to act as my primer so I'm just
gonna go ahead and set down this white
shade as a base using a Real Techniques
deluxe concealer brush and since I did
want to do my face first I'm gonna keep
the eyes pretty simple I'm just it's
kind of like my go-to look as of right
now I'm spending so much time outside
and just like working up a sweat walking
with the dog going to the park and all
that fun stuff so I've been keeping the
eyes pretty simple as of lately and also
I think from just a few times that I've
used it the palette does get quite a bit
of Fallout so I don't want to do
anything like too crazy and have it all
over my face I don't know if you'd be
able to see even just from using that
white shade there is some fallout on the
palate as well and so let's just go
let's just go pretty typical here and
get through this I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this shade I'm going to use the
stove Lassa ll 216 at blending brush i
am trying out still Aza
brushes they sent me a bunch of their
brushes which I'm always excited to try
out new brushes I'm just gonna take that
first color and just work it into the
crease that one's coming off really
nicely pigment it looks like it's pretty
easy to blend into the crease there and
I like that color and I'm getting a lot
of kick up in the palette with this
shade but so far on that first day I
didn't notice any fallout on my face so
that's good
it's gonna take the shade a road down
from that first one I'm going to use the
Sigma e-40 for this has been like one of
my favorite brushes as of lately I feel
like I'm grabbing for it a lot so I'm
just gonna kind of use that to darken up
outer part of the eye here so again the
shades going on very nicely as well and
no fallout on my face so that's good are
so good I'm really liking how those
shadows look nothing on my face hmm
that's pretty nifty okay I'm gonna go in
with a shimmer but I kind of look I'm
really feeling like these coffee vibes I
almost a lot of times I'll do like a
light shimmer but I almost
kind of want to keep it just a little
bit more on the latte side if you will I
don't even know that I don't know what a
latte is I don't really drink coffee go
with this one right here it looks to be
kind of more of a satin so we'll see how
I like that one
and if need be I'll add in the other
shimmer so I'm just gonna get my brush
damp I'm going to use the Sigma e25 I so
I actually really like how it made the
look it's not like I said it's not a
shimmer it's kind of just more of a
satin but I feel like it like it
deepened up the look but nothing went
too dark or too extreme I actually
really like the way that it kind of took
this eyelid
I'm really happy with this palette right
now I was kind of skeptical going into
it like I said I just have kind of
dabbled into it a little bit
mostly for like lower lash work and
things like that and I felt like I
wasn't too impressed off the bat so I'm
really excited that I decided to grab it
out for this tutorial and you know just
give it another chance just like with
that morphe palette did get just a
little bit of fallout on my face from
that last shade so I'm just gonna go
ahead and lightly dust that away but
that's pretty good and it might be more
because I was packing on the shadow
versus just kind of like blending it out
add eyeliner and also mascara and then
we'll come back to finish off the eyes
and add some highlight but and it's on
that brown liner from the balm and then
I also put on the lash warrior mascara
from flower beauty this mascara is so
freaky nice I gotta send me from octoly
our requested I might actually FreeStore
then I actually got a PR package from
flower beauty which I totally was not
expecting but I was very excited about
it and this mascara is so nice I started
trying it just a couple days before I
left for my Oklahoma City trip and this
was the only mascara that I took with me
so that shows you how much faith I had
in it because I didn't even bring false
lashes or anything this is also at Ulta
so I believe it's linked down below but
other than that I'm just gonna go ahead
and finish off my lower lash line so I'm
going to come back into the palette I'm
gonna grab the Sigma pencil brush the
e30 and I'm just gonna do a mixture of
the two shades that I first blended out
on to my lady as I'm doing this there's
like a lot of powder kick up and I can
tell it's like going into my eyes and
like I was saying when I was first
trying out this palette it was for like
lower lash work and inner corner and
such and I feel like that's probably
what kill me the impression that I might
not love it but the powders are so
smooth when you're just kind of blending
them out so I like it better that way
but I'm just gonna kind of make sure
that's all blended into the lower lash
line and kind of meets the top of our
work I I live work as well I don't know
what I'm trying to say there I've been
filming for over two hours at this point
so forgive me if I'm starting to lose it
I grabbed my more can't you 36 just a
small pencil brush and I'm just gonna
put a little bit of shimmer into my
inner corner I'm gonna grab this top
middle shade here I did spray my brush
as well just like I said I feel like as
you're packing on shadows and such I
feel like it would help to have a damp a
brush to kind of help with the fallout
and whatnot I'm actually really feeling
this I like so I'm happy about that I
know it's very plain and just your
bronze smokey eye but I like the way it
came out I like the way that it's
looking and I'm like in that pellet so
that's pretty good now before I do my
highlight I'm gonna spray my face I've
been doing this a lot I feel like I've
been testing out some more matte
foundations which is not the norm for me
but I feel like I've been spraying my
face before I do highlight and then
spray my face again at the end I feel
like it's just helping give me extra
hydration might as well be in my head
but that's okay now I'm gonna use the
mac fix+
in lavender this guy I finished my other
pics plus that I had in my a 20-18
project pan and so I started using this
one it smells so freakin nice so nice
finish it off I'm gonna come back into
the morphe 8l palette so I have already
used this highlight right here which is
in cosmic so I think I'm gonna go with I
don't know let me swatch the highlights
actually okay so here are the highlights
in here I feel like this one's gonna be
too like yellow and this one has like a
purple shift to it that you don't
necessarily see in the palette so that's
kind of interesting yeah I don't think
the first one would look the best on my
particular skin tone this one just is a
little bit too on that purple side for
me I've used this one so I think I'm
just gonna go ahead and try that third
one which is in super No
I'm going to use the Sigma fo three one
of my favorites highlight brushes ooh
that's pretty
that has a bit of a shift in it as well
it has kind of like a pinky shift I
didn't notice that from the oh I didn't
notice that from the swatch that I did
that's very pretty though I don't mind
it it's just it's not quite I don't know
I just it's not quite what I was
expecting and not necessarily what I
always reach for when it comes to my my
highlight but it's still very pretty and
it's showing up very well I love color
I'm just gonna apply some Mac honey love
and then the mac lipglass and under the
sheets is one of my favorite
combinations I'm gonna spray my face one
more time and then we are done
alrighty so this is the final look that
I came up today trying out some new
makeup so to run through everything real
quickly of course the milk makeup the
watermelon and brightening serum I'll
for sure have to put into my skincare
routine and see what I think over the
next couple weeks here but so far I
liked it right off the bat I like the
way it felt it sunk into the skin fairly
quickly which was good I just I don't
know I liked how cooling and how like my
skin felt hydrate it once I put it on so
I appreciate that with my dry skin the
covergirl the skin smoothing a primer it
seemed like a pretty good primer again
I'm just gonna have to try it out a
couple more times primers don't
necessarily always get my juices flowing
but hey you never know it could be a
favorite in the next couple weeks here
now they covergirl foundations like I
said I've been filming now for we're
about to hit the three hour mark which
is crazy and I honestly still feel like
my foundation it looks really good I
feel like with everything applied you
know I got my bronzer working I got my
highlight working now I feel like my
skin does look really nice especially
for on that foundation which I don't
necessarily love I feel like everything
applied over the foundation very well I
didn't have any problems with the
powders are the other liquids that I was
putting on my skin I'm really excited to
see how it wears throughout the day
again I'll be back in a couple weeks to
give full reviews on everything and I
will just be testing this foundation out
the best primers to use with it the best
way to apply it and all of that good
stuff but off the bat I'm actually
pretty darn impressed with it there's a
lot of things I don't like about of
matte
that it's not ruining it for me at this
moment so that's pretty good stuff for
three hours of where I feel like we're
looking pretty good at the moment so
that has me excited again I think this
is a very exciting drugstore release a
morphe 8l palette I think it's a pretty
good palette again I just feel like the
shades in here aren't it's it's probably
not gonna be my most reached for a face
palette you can see my messy desk it's
probably not gonna be my most reach for
face palette because not all of the
shades will work for me so that's kind
of the hard part when you are buying a
face palette is is it going to be worth
it so hopefully some of my swatches
helped you out again it's $25 you get a
great great packaging here eight
different shades the mirror and all of
that it's just really gonna be a
personal preference of course when it
comes to makeup but I'll keep testing it
out of course the wiki luxe coffee
palette actually has me pretty impressed
I'm really liking the eye look that I
came up with it's super simple super
basic super me and I enjoy that but I
was very impressed how everything went
on how everything blended we'll see how
it lasts throughout the day if I have
any issues with fading or anything but
especially not having a lot of Fallout
on my face I thought that was pretty
darn good and then the Cavan of Quan
blush I mean like you saw very pigmented
you can become a clown Pro quickly with
these but I'm a big fan of the face
products from the brand and I think I'm
gonna be impressed with these is a $38
blush or $36 blush going to be totally
worth it for you you'll have to decide
like these I like these I like the
concept of them and I think I'm gonna
like that one so that is it for today's
video
