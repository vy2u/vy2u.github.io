today's video I'm going to be playing
with some new makeup so I'm gonna be
doing most of my face here on camera
going through any new makeup that I have
including one of the new NYX elements
palettes in your element palette this is
the one inspire I was talking about this
in a recent will i buy it video and i
picked it up so we're gonna see if it is
worth thirty dollars for a drugstore
eyeshadow palette i also have the new
tarte baked blush book 3 this was sent
to me from a subscriber so thank you so
much Katie we're gonna play with this
today as well I also got my foundation
sample in I mentioned it in my will I
buy a video when I was talking about 50
Beauty that they were having free
samples with Sephora orders so I have a
foundation sample so if you are ready to
test out new makeup why don't we go
ahead and get started I am going to
start off with my eyes so I do have them
primed and then just with a bit of
translucent powder over them but I'm
firstly playing with this NYX of fire
palette so this is part of the new
collection that came out with I think
they have a six different i shadow
pellets in there so this is what fire
looks like in there pretty decent pan
shades because this is $30 which is so
expensive for a drugstore palette and I
will it buy it I was like I just don't
know if I can spend $30 on a drum server
pellet but guess what I did it expect me
on this palette before they shared the
price with us and I thought that was
real rude like I see what you were doing
it does have a really nice mirror here
which is good the packaging feels nice
like it feels like quality packaging
it's not some like it's a nice packaging
so at least there is that so I don't
know let's go ahead and just swatch
everything first I'll just go ahead and
swatch the first row because I really
have no idea like what shades to play
with or what to do so here is the first
row there are the swatches Hey
okay so I mean you can't always judge my
swatches but that didn't really do a
whole lot and they appear to be pretty
like chalky and streaky so okay let's
try the second row right here is the
second row of swatches they all feel
really smooth and nice
but I don't know I'm definitely gonna
have to put these on my eyes because I
was live right now I'm not feeling super
hyped like even that red it kind of is
more like a pink red and not quite as
vibrant as I was hoping so let's go
ahead and try the last row and see what
we think I was pretty nervous to get it
especially because I bought it like
before you know really any reviews came
out I was like okay you caught my
attention like NYX if you're really
gonna charge $30 for an eyeshadow
palette like you must be pretty hyped
like you must think that this is you
know super quality eyeshadow palette and
the swatches are telling me otherwise so
this one's interesting it's like a
duochrome down there but I don't know so
now that I have the swatches I feel like
that didn't help me at all with what I
want to play with because nothing really
spoke over to me in this palette but I'm
just gonna I'm gonna go ahead and zoom
you in and let's just give it a try
whole well up there so I'm just gonna
maybe do somewhat of like a fire look
that's what I'm gonna try to go for but
I'm gonna come into the yellow shade up
here using my Sigma e-40 I wouldn't
really ever think of this as a
transition but I know I watched I love
Sarah ease video the other day and she's
kind of like the face for the fire
palette and not that I'm gonna attempt
to recreate her look but it because I
honestly I don't remember it and this
was a few days ago that I watched it but
I feel like I'm gonna try to mimic some
of the shades that I remember she used
and I could have swore she went in with
the yellow first but I could be way
wrong but I'm just gonna try to do
something a little bit you know on the
norm today because I feel like that's
kind of what this palette calls for so
we're just gonna start with the yellow
and put this into the crease I'm gonna
grab the Sigma e35 it's just a little
bit smaller and more dense than the e-40
I'm going to pick up kind of orange
shade it's on here in the corner and I'm
gonna put that on to the crease as well
just a little bit lower then the yellow
and
No Circle it around out here and the
outer corner of my eye I feel like on
the eyes they've been okay like the
yellow went on all right and blend it
well this orange one I mean it looks to
be pretty good I'm not you know I'm not
a makeup artist guy so I'm not the best
like makeup blender in the entire world
so we can't always fault the makeup for
that sometimes it's just my fault cuz
I'm not the best but I don't know if I
feel like it's it's not blending as
easily as some eyeshadows do but it's
also not like the worst I think it's
doing fine so far I just feel like I
have like the $30 price tag like I feel
like it's like blinking on and off above
my head like $30 $30 nix nix nix like
that's what I feel like is happening
right now I want to go into a shimmer
shade and see how it works I feel like
I'm most attracted to this one down here
in this corner so I'm gonna grab this is
a sigma e 56 I just got this brush it's
just a like flat shader brush but I
might obsessed with it so yeah that
looks pretty nice I didn't use any sort
of setting spray first that's kind of
how I like to test him first to see that
looks all right and there's not like too
much kick up in the palette or nothing
to be able to see it on camera there's
really not too much kick up not really
any fallout on my face that's actually
mmm
I'm not mad that shade that one looks
pretty good I am gonna try to spray my
brush just let's see if it gets it even
more of an mmm-hmm I can tell this a
little bit more metallic but honestly I
didn't think that but she'd really
needed it it doesn't give it like too
much of a boost because that's pretty
darn pigmented on its own so hey hey
that's pretty good actually really
impressed with that shimmer shade I'm
gonna come in I want to I want to dip
into this this red shade right there and
I'm just gonna put some more on the a 35
that I was using and just kind of make
sure everything is kind of blended out
over here see that's more pink I don't
know if you guys would be able to tell
on camera that's
red that's pink I want to be bred it's
like it's almost like a hot pink that's
so disappointing and that's not what I
wanted I want it red mmm oh well we're
just gonna go with it so we're just
gonna make sure this is blend it out
over here and then slowly start to work
it in hmm okay well the shimmer shade
has me all excited and then that one
just kind of took it away kind of it's a
good away cuz look at my brush can you
tell if you can see my brush it's pink
it's not bad I mean I feel like in a
fighter palette you have red so then I'm
gonna come back in with that same
shimmer and just kind of go over
everything wasn't wanting a pink in my
look so we're just gonna dry pretend
that didn't happen before I move on to
my face I'm gonna do liner I'm gonna do
a winged liner off-camera but I did get
these new lashes and I'm super excited
about them these have been on my wish
list for such a long time and they are
finally available at Sephora and I
picked them up and so far I was having
double cashback the other day double
cashback on them because these are some
expensive lashes these are from blinking
butte or blinking beauty I feel like I
hear more people say blinking buttes of
us wouldn't go with and these are in the
style Coquette so these are what the
lashes look like I think they're so
beautiful
Amanda n singh loves these lashes she's
always raving about them so they now
have a few Styles up at Sephora so I am
gonna need to like cut and trim them and
stuff but I wanted to show you what they
look like before I went to town on them
getting them ready for my lashes these
are $25 so I better love them because
that's even more expensive than my hooda
lashes so I really hope that I love
these but I'm gonna go ahead and do my
winged liner and I'll pop on these
lashes and then I will let you know what
I think of them flashes are on so again
these are blinking beaut in Coquette I
think they look okay I love how like
wispy they are they're not super
dramatic for me for me they're not like
the most super dramatic style I've ever
worn but I love how long they are there
very fluffy the band was very like soft
and light wasn't an overwhelming band at
all I think maybe I should have even
trimmed him even more I trimmed off so
much you guys but I feel like I maybe
could have turned off even more because
I can feel like this one is too far in
on my inner corner and it's kind of
bothering me a little but so I'm gonna
pause on the eyes for a sec and then
move on into my face if I have my face
primed already and I'm going to try out
my phantom UT sample of the pro filter
soft matte a long wear foundation so
when I place my support order the other
day they have these samples on there and
like I mentioned the Willy bite video I
said I went ahead and got a sample I
mean that's a decent sample and this was
free this was one of like their weekly
specials so I don't know if you want to
try the foundation maybe see if Sephora
still has the free samples but I'm
pretty sure this shade is gonna be all
wrong it said you could choose your
shade and then it had four shades that
was it isn't 2:10 and like I know some
of my friends who have skin like me and
they're like in 180 190 so this is gonna
be an adventure but we'll go ahead and
see I'm gonna use my Sigma 3d HD max
kabuki this is like all I've been using
for foundation lately I tried to use the
Beauty Blender the other day and I felt
I felt very weird so I'm nervous because
people say it oxidizes a lot too I know
Finn T beauty and so it does not oxidize
just dries darker but I don't know I
guess I thought that's what oxidizing me
so I think there's a lot of confusion
over that whole my goodness that is whoa
whoa what a full-coverage okay okay
okay I see you Rihanna I said am i will
i buy it video wasn't that I wasn't
excited like I don't know how many times
I said like I love Rihanna and I'm so
excited that she did this and I think
she did it right like so awesome that
things weren't selling out and someone
left a comment on my video and my camera
if they said they worked at Sephora or
they were talking to someone at Sephora
about centi beauty and they said like
they're stocked up for like the next two
years or something and I'm like why
can't all makeup lines do that because
that's freaking awesome
so I think that she did so many things
right it just not a lot of it was
catching my personal attention or things
that I wasn't sure looked good on me and
with the foundation like why not get a
sample first make sure you like it
instead of running out right away and
paying for a full sized like yes I know
that you can return things but just get
a free sample if you can I mean I don't
know that seems pretty simple to me so I
don't like the way it looks on my nose
because I don't know I have some like
dry patches on my nose and I feel like
it's like clinging to all of those
patches and making my nose like really
like scaly and bumpy so that's kind of
weird but other than that I think it
looks okay like shade match I think it
looks fine now but we'll see once it
starts to dry how much darker it gets
I'm a little bit nervous
it was definitely full coverage well
that was for sure I put on my second
skin everything else it looks fine it
looks mattifying to me I think it looks
pretty good it is kind of I have like
kind of lines around my mouth you know
cousin 30 so I have like smile lines and
it's kind of in those lines I lines on
my forehead too but I don't see them as
pronounced as my smile lines which is
weird because usually it's the other way
around other than that I think it's
looking pretty good we'll see if it
oxidizes throughout the video but I
don't have any new concealer or like
setting powder or anything to play with
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that off
camera I have concealer and powder on so
far so good
so next up I'm gonna use a bronzer this
is from Estee Lauder this is their
bronze goddess bronzer and I am super
excited about it I did get this sent to
me from octa Lee so a huge thank you to
actually an Estee Lauder I actually have
another Estee Lauder product I have a
brow product that I'm gonna be trying
from them in this video too so let's see
this is like a that's a baked bronzer
okay and it comes with this little brush
here and then there is what the bronzer
looks like it actually kind of looks
cool toned to me at first glance but
we'll go ahead and see I'm not really
like a fan of brushes so I'm have fan of
brushes that come with product it does
have a mirror on it so I'm gonna use my
Sigma f30 this is a powder brush but I
highly use it as better because that is
how I do so I'm just gonna kind of
defend a start and bronze up the skin
I'm kind of worried about like going too
much on the bronzing especially if it if
my foundation is gonna start getting
darker but hey we'll just give it a try
they so far so good on the bronzer this
is in the shade medium I think it's
looking for a nice on the skin
blending easily hmm so bronzer is on I
think that is looking pretty good as
well I'm gonna keep moving along with my
face before I finish off my eyes so I'm
gonna use this big blush book 3 from
Tarte this is one of their holiday
releases I was talking about it in a
will I might video and I wasn't sure I
wanted to get it because I know some
people say that the holiday releases are
you know different formula and from the
regular releases so I wasn't sure about
it but then it actually came in my PL
box and my subscriber friend Katie sent
this over to me so thank you so much I
did have to dip into it because I was so
excited about it so I've been trying it
the last two days so far I think it's
pretty good at the highlighter I did
have to build up just a bit it took me a
while to get it to the full illumination
that I really wanted it to but I think
the blushes seemed pretty darn good I've
been trying to to try a few of them to
really test them out but so far they've
been pretty good so I'm gonna come in to
this lavish shade up here and use my
Sigma f40 this is a angled contour brush
and I use it for blush because I prefer
to be a rebel so I mean I think they're
pretty I think they're pretty pigmented
because I actually the first time I went
to use it I kind of like went ham and
like dug my brush in it and like powder
kicked up everywhere and when I went
like this it was like boom clown stamp I
was like I wasn't expecting them to be
pigmented I guess I don't know did that
wrong my bad
I'll keep testing it out so I can give a
full review but from the two times that
I have tried it I think it's been
looking pretty good and even today I do
like this color as well well for the
highlight I feel like you do have to
kind of build it up a bit and I kind of
have a couple different brushes that I
use for highlighting
have some like bigger fluffier brushes
that I like for more like pigment
highlight oranges highlights that are
super blinding and don't need a lot of
help I like to use my fluffier brushes
but for highlights that just the need
they need a little bit of help I go with
the Sigma fo3 this really is just my
favorite highlighting brush in general
especially for a shade like this I've
just come to realize that it really does
need this type of brush that you just
kind of pick up the highlights
you're done there and I've had this
blush book and the highlight on in my
past two videos I'm pretty sure it is I
always have the makeup that I'm wearing
listed in my description box down below
hmm yes yes I have been wearing this
highlight and a lot of people have been
complimenting me on it so it has been
from here and I think that is so pretty
so once I started using this brush for
this highlight it doesn't take me as
long to build it up and when I was using
more of a fluffier brush I was like what
is going on this highlight it's not as
blinding as I wanted it to be but if you
use something that's just a little bit
more firm for a brush then you can
really get in there mm-hmm oh yeah oh
yeah that's pretty next up I'm going to
do my brows so then I can finish off my
eyes so this was sent to me from Estee
Lauder and actally as well this is the
brow multitasker and I'm very nervous it
is in the shade blonde so hopefully that
will be an OK shade it reminds me of
like the goof proof pencil with kind of
this teardrop shape and then oh it does
have the spoolie on the other end so
that is fantastic I thought I said it
was a three and one but what's the
what's the third one
what says on one end a unique triangular
tip pencil fills and contours brows in
the center a sponge tip applicator is
primed with brow powder and then it has
the spoolie brush so what you can take
this apart oh look at that you take it
apart in the middle and this is a brow
powder ah would you look at that gonna
go ahead and fill my brows in first so I
take the spoolie end
kind of brush everything up and together
and then I'm gonna take like the
sharpest tip and stir it up to face my
brow and start to make a line then I'm
gonna make a couple of light strokes in
the front here I'm gonna kind of just go
through and fill everything in any
sparse areas and then I'm done I just
kind of run the spoolie lightly through
everything again and make sure all the
hairs are in the direction I want them
to go that is basically my brow routine
as primed with brow powder to create
fullness and death I don't know about
this I'm kind of nervous I don't even
know how would you do this you just kind
of like stroke it through maybe I don't
know
I'm being I'm being very very light
handed with this because I feel like I'm
not 100% what I'm doing but you guys so
much of a difference or was it did I go
too light anthem because I get nervous
I'm not agree with brows so so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my other brow off-camera
to let my camera cool down and then
we'll come back and finish off the eyes
both my brows on I'm still a little
unsure what I thought of it but I think
we made it through okay
I added some a black liner into my
waterline and then also my tight line
and then I'm gonna come back in with the
NYX palette so I'm gonna try this shade
over here in the corner just looks a
little bit intriguing to me this is my
Sigma e30 my prey and a new pencil just
gather the money latest haul that I did
and I'm just going to start to smudge
that across the lower lash line let's
shine up pretty well that looks nice and
then I'm gonna add in actually a little
bit of this purple shade as well kind of
like a burgundy I'm sure your dad today
I'm just gonna use the same brush and
just kind of sweep that along as well
that looks pretty - it's gonna take a
little baby brush this is the Sigma e 21
but think I'm just gonna grab some of
this first shade here it kind of has
like it's kind of like yellow-green
iridescent I don't know I'm gonna see
what that looks like on the inner corner
just
because I'm curious that's kind of fun
it's not super overwhelming but kind of
gives a little something-something to
the inner corner okay
okay I'm just gonna hit my lower lashes
real quick with some mascara the eyes
are finished I think about the fire
palette let me know let me know in the
comments of course first impression I'll
do a wrap-up at the end but there we go
fire then lastly I'm just going in to
finish off with a lip color this is new
from morphe in collaboration with Orpha
and it is in the shade vinyl they send
along a lip liner but I'm just gonna go
right in with the liquid lipstick it's
said on the package that it was for like
girls of the 90s and this is such a 90s
color I thought that was pretty funny
this is the morphe and Orpha lip in
vinyl this is definitely very 90s it is
also very full I really enjoyed these
night these types of colors so after the
lip I'm gonna spray my face with some
setting spray and then this lip is
complete okay so this is the final look
they're testing out some new makeup let
me know what you guys think in the
comments down below I'm not gonna do a
check-in I'm filming on Thursday and I
do a youtube live on Thursday nights at
7:30 so I will kind of do an update in
that live video so if you missed the
live if you weren't able to come by I
will leave a link to it down below if
you want to check it out there but I
will also do a follow-up in about two
weeks this is what I did the last time
that I was doing like a first impression
type of video I'll come back in about
two weeks because I'll keep testing
everything out and come back to be able
to do a full review to give a rundown on
everything that we played with is so
first of course the NYX of fire palette
I have to say that the swatches did not
impress me at all I was super worried
when I started swatching and I just feel
like there's gonna be some hit and miss
shades in here like some shades I
thought were really really good and some
shades I was like not very impressed
with I am super sad but this is more of
like almost like a hot pink versus a red
that was really disappointing to me
because I would have thought a fire
palette red like I was so excited for
that red yellow and orange like to me I
was just I was just pumped and ready for
it so that was a bit of a letdown but
the shimmer worked out really well even
without like that's
impress me the most I think without
having any sort of setting spray that I
used with it and it still showed up that
well I really like the shades that I
chose for my lower lashline I thought
those are really nice and pigmented and
I did like the inner corner so I'm gonna
keep playing with this let me know if
there's any specific looks that you want
to see I'll probably do a couple
Instagram tutorials as well and I'll let
you know in two weeks time right off the
bat I don't hate it
I'm not gonna return it right off the
bat but I need to definitely play with
it a little bit more I didn't fall in
love with it on the first try either
we're just we're we're in a likeable
relationship right now that's where we
like each other the blinking abuse
lashes in a Coquette I'm really liking
them so far again they just they feel so
light on the eyes like I feel like I
don't have lashes on this eye this eye I
need to trim more because I can tell
it's too close to the inner corner of my
eye and I think once I do that it'll be
just like this eye where I literally I
don't feel like I'm wearing lashes and I
think the style is super pretty so I'm
really excited the blinking beaut is
that Sephora now because it was really
hard to pay $25 for lashes and not get
any rewards points any Ebates anything
like that now that they're at Sephora
I'm much more open into purchasing more
expensive lashes if I'll get like a bit
of a kickback somewhere so so far we're
looking so good has anybody tried the
blinking beaut lashes what's your
favorite style moving on to the face so
the Fendi foundation can you guys tell
that I got darker on my skin I can tell
but not as not as much as I thought
maybe it was going to I think it was
Jamie Genovese video that I was watching
and she tried the foundation and I could
really really tell a difference from
just that she was sitting down doing her
makeup I could really tell how much
darker the foundation got this is shade
210 I thought for sure I would be more
like 190 180 it's definitely full
coverage and I can tell it's full
coverage like it to me it looks like I'm
wearing foundation and I don't like full
coverage you hear me say that a lot I'm
not a huge fan of full coverage
foundations and I just I feel like you
can tell that I'm wearing foundation I
can see all these like lines around my
mouth which I don't love my nose looks
horrible like my nose looks so bad
I don't know if I just have a lot of dry
skin on my nose right now and it's just
really picking it up or what is
happening there but I don't know it's a
it's a matte finish and I like that I
don't mind a matte foundation because
then I come in and add my own highlight
so I don't mind that it's matte but like
I feel like it's like doing really weird
things so I scan like even right here I
feel like it's like pulling funny like
it's like pulling my skin funny
I don't know I'm gonna wear it the rest
of the night I'll wear it all through my
life and I'll be talking about it over
there too and you know obviously I'm
gonna wear it through the next coming
weeks so I can review it in about two
weeks I can't say right off the bat that
I'm like yes just found my new favorite
foundation I might have to play around
with it you know I used a brush maybe
I'll try a Beauty Blender I just feel
like it looks so heavy on my skin and
that's why I don't like full coverage
foundation I know a lot of people do and
like that's what you like but for me
personally I just don't really love that
but I'll keep trying it out I'll keep
trying it out again my shade was 210 in
case you're curious so moving on to my
bronzer from Estee Lauder like this is a
beast brother are you kidding me
look are you kidding me I could give
this to my daughter's 21st birthday and
I am not pregnant I have no kids like
this is going to last me forever and
then last her forever this is huge but I
didn't really like it again this is in
the shade medium I thought it looked
really good on my skin as well look like
there's shimmer in it like when I look
really closely it actually looks like
there's shimmer but I couldn't notice
that on my face I didn't notice
like I didn't feel like I was putting a
shimmer bronzer on it blended out really
easily and I thought it looked pretty
good so I'm excited I love bronzer I
love finding new bronzers that I love
woohoo you know a lot of you have been
very curious about the Tarte big blush
book 3 I talked about on my snapchat I
posted some swatches on my Instagram and
everybody is like is it the same as the
Tarte blushes honestly I don't think the
blushes are the same but I don't think
that they're bad either way I'm having
no problem and getting blush onto my
cheeks I'm having no problem picking up
any of the blushes I've tried three
different blushes so far but so far I
truly don't feel like it is the same
a couple of the Tarte Amazonian clay
single blushes though this is made in
China and I don't believe the Tarte
Amazonian clay blushes are made in China
so I believe that these are different
but I don't think that it means that
they're bad eye I'm impressed so far
with this I will keep trying it I will
give it a full review but so far so good
if you've been curious about it I would
say you can go ahead and purchase it and
test it out for yourself I don't think
this is the worst thing ever
the highlight is really gorgeous if you
like a gold highlight just takes a
little bit to build up and I would
definitely suggest using more of a dense
brush like the fo3 that I use don't use
anything fluffy because you're not gonna
get a lot of product out of it but other
than that I've been really happy with
this one so far so I'm excited to keep
playing with it and it's again Thank You
Katie thank you for sending this to me
the brow product that I use this
reminded me a lot of the goof proof from
benefit which is actually one of the
first brow pencils that I ever started
using it felt waxy err then the goof
proof it felt almost like I feel like
this is kind of like the waxy ass brow
pencil that I've ever used my shade was
blonde and I think that's a pretty
decent shade not you like it I'm not
sure what I feel about that powder I
just tried to do a really light hand
because I didn't want like super
overwhelming brows but so far it's
pretty decent I'm definitely gonna have
to keep trying this a couple more times
so so far brows weren't a complete fail
because you know sometimes when we test
new brow products it's a fail and of
course the last item that I tried was
the morphe and Orpha liquid lipstick in
the shade final I have more people to
put lipsticks and I really enjoy them
I've talked about them a lot I feel like
not a lot of people talk about them and
I think that they are very good and very
long-lasting so I'm excited to see if
this one is similar to the other two
shapes that I have which are schoolgirl
and peanut I love this color I love this
color I think you're gonna be seeing me
wear a lot of these types of 90s kind of
their I mean they're red but like not
totally red and I really do like the
look in general at first I was gonna do
a nude lip because that's always my
fallback but I was really like I saw
this color and got excited right away so
I'm diggin this color so far everything
application wise feels really nice I
don't like them working look what
lipsticks are super drying it is
completely matte on my lips it is
transfer proof as well so so far
so good with the more feet and Orpha
final liquid lipstick i guess so that is
everything for my testing out some new
makeup products like i mentioned i will
be coming back in about two weeks to
give an update on everything in my final
reviews and my final thoughts I'll be
doing a couple Instagram tutorials in
the meantime as well with some of these
