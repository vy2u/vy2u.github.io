today's video is going to be a follow-up
video from my trying new makeup video I
posted about two weeks ago where I was
trying out products such as the NYX fire
palette also the Fendi foundation I've
been using these products these past two
weeks so I could come back and give a
better review on them since a lot of
times trying out makeup for the first
time on camera you really can't get a
good feel for the item so I wanted to
come back and do a follow-up so that is
what we will be doing today so if you
want to see my review and thoughts on
some of these new products that I was
trying it why don't we go ahead and get
started first I want to say I apologize
if you can hear a lawnmower we just got
new neighbors right across the street
from us and apparently they don't know
yet that between the hours of 1:00 and
3:00 you don't mow your grass because
that's when I have filmed I don't know I
guess I should welcome them to the
neighborhood and let them know I'm just
kidding but they did just start to
mother grass as soon as I clicked record
on my camera I was like no way it was
real like but we're just going to try to
go ahead and get past that because I
really do want to talk to you guys about
this eyeshadow palette the NYX fire
palette I really want to talk about this
one today because actually I had not
planned on filming this video today I
had another video in mind a video that
will be becoming before this video goes
live and I started to do my makeup with
the fire palette and I got so upset that
I was like you gather just need to take
your makeup off and try again you just
need to take your makeup off not film
today you need to need to do something
because your makeups not looking great
and then I thought well I make my
schedule I'm just gonna pull inaudible
I'm gonna switch these videos around and
I'm gonna film this video first so you
guys can maybe see from a my eye makeup
like why I'm so upset with the fire
palette so obviously if you can't tell I
was not able to get along with this
palette you saw in the video me really
struggling and I was super bummed
because this is a $30 I shadow palette
from a drugstore brand a $30 hi shadow
palette that is expensive for a
drugstore palette I really enjoy NYX
it's a brand I've been buying
from very very long time I have a lot of
their products and like a lot of their
products so when I saw this one of the
first things I thought was if they're
gonna charge $30 for an eyeshadow
palette they really feel confident in
this palette like they really feel like
they stepped up their game and that they
can charge consumers $30 for an
eyeshadow palette the pros the packaging
is great
I enjoyed the sturdy packaging that's a
plus for your $30 you know I like all
these little fire element thingies here
that's very cool
the mirror is fantastic great mirror
very big very clear super easy to do
makeup in with this mirror I thought it
was really awesome the pan sizes are
very large that's great unfortunately
the actual products the actual shades
are not really so great and you can see
in the video I was having trouble
blending these eyeshadows a lot of
people were like my eyes actually hurt
watching you trying to blend these
eyeshadows I'm gonna come in with
different brushes to try to blend these
eyeshadows it was not really working out
and the pigment is really lacking in a
lot of them I was pleasantly surprised
with this shade right here when I was
selling that video I didn't have to come
in with any setting spray at first and
it showed up really well and then used
the setting spray and it was even better
I was very impressed so then today I
tried to use the Skjold one right here
and I was like I'm just gonna do the
same thing I'm gonna comment with no
setting spray first and I you know put
my brush in it and I looked at my brush
and I was like did nothing nothing
happened and so I put it on my eyes
nothing I worked so hard to get this
tiny bit of gold onto my eyes for my
brush dip it in put the eyeshadows on
take off spray my brush dip it in put
the eyeshadow on I did that at least 10
times I never have to spray my brush
multiple times and this is what I got I
also used this shade today this is
what's mostly in my crease extremely
hard to blend I don't know if you guys
could tell I tried so hard I used three
different blending brushes I never do
that either three different blending
brushes to try to get what we have going
on on the eyes and I was just getting
extremely flustered the
red is also extremely disappointing to
me you saw in the video it's more of a
hot pink wanted to create like a really
like fiery red eye in that trying new
makeup video and comment it in that
video your fire kind of looks like a
sunset I'm like you know what you are
correct so that was really disappointing
not all of the shades are truly terrible
on right here was a pretty nice blue
this one right here was pretty nice too
the orange wasn't too bad but like the
red is a total letdown the yellow total
letdown I mean that's why I'm buying a
fire palette is for those shades so for
those to be super disappointing that was
a huge bummer the gold is not good at
all this one is an extremely extremely
patchy shade I mean I'm I'm really upset
this palette I was excited for this
palette like right when I saw it I was
excited for I was ready for it I bought
it at Ulta the day that it released I
was super stoked for it but for $30 no
even for $20 better eyeshadow palette in
your collection you're gonna buy it
better eyeshadow palette before 2017 is
over like I don't get mad at makeup a
lot I really don't but I'm not at this
moment I will be returning this to
although this was not worth the money to
me
I did try several times using this
palette and it was kind of to the point
where I was having to bring in other
palettes to complete the look because
the shades were so bad or the one night
where I was like girl you really need to
try that palette again like just give it
a shot I waited until it was late at
night I'd already washed my makeup off
and then I went in and tried again
because I was like I don't even want to
waste like a filming day a filming face
with this eyeshadow palette because like
nothing's doing so then when I tried it
again today and I was so upset with
myself I was like you played yourself
girl you knew that was gonna happen
I can't recommend it I will be returning
it super disappointed someone commented
in that video and said that their pellet
is really pigmented and the red is
actually a red I don't know I hate the
whole like I just got a bad palette I
think that's really annoying so I saw in
that video that was not a red eyeshadow
you saw how tough I was blending you can
see what's going on in my eyes today I
tried really really hard it tends to
look hard knowing that I was gonna film
but no
this will be going back to alta the next
item that I tried in that video I'm much
more excited about those eyelashes that
I tried these are the blinking at beauty
or blinking beaut Coquette lashes I got
these from Sephora and okay I'm pretty
happy with these these are what they
look like they of course have been like
trimmed and used several times I have
been wearing the crap out of these
lashes
I love these lashes I love them I think
it's the fact that I can't feel them on
my eyes and I think that is really
really important I was away last weekend
I was traveling out of town and I put
these lashes on at probably like 10
o'clock in the morning I did my makeup
on Friday and I was up until 2:00 a.m. I
want to say and then again Saturday
morning I put them on around 11 o'clock
and I have them on until midnight
I was not bothered I had no idea I truly
did not feel like I was wearing false
eyelashes they are so lightweight and so
comfortable on the eyes
I think this style is really really
pretty as well and I think they've been
holding up really nicely I've been
wearing them so often haven't even
cleaned these yet and I've worn it I
know more than 10 times so feel like
they're holding up really well they are
expensive at twenty-five dollars so I
truly still want to get them like when I
bought these it was because I got double
cashback at Sephora I still would prefer
to get either double cashback or have
some sort of sale or discount at Sephora
because 25 dollars is really expensive
for lashes but truly these are really
really good and I am excited to try out
another style I claim will be picking up
another pair from blinking a beauty if
you are someone who loves lashes and you
wear a lot of lashes and you can invest
in lashes because you wear them so often
I would definitely check them out they
are at Sephora now so they're easily
accessible and I will be trying out more
from this brand next up in the video I
tried the frente beauty foundation a
little sample size I got it from Sephora
when I placed one of my recent orders
they were having free foundation samples
this is a really good size though it's
point2 fluid ounces use this in the
video and I didn't quite love it and
it's been very interesting because I've
been watching you know the 1.2 million
20 videos that are out there and it's
interesting that whenever anybody says
that they don't like anything from 20
Beauty the amount of like hate and
backlash towards that is really
bewildering to me I it's it's confusing
to me that people truly believe that
everybody is going to love something
everyone is going to have the same like
outcome when using makeup I mean it's
it's really mind-boggling to me that so
many people truly believe that because
that's just not the case
so I feel like I'm about to make people
a little bit upset when I talk about how
I've been getting on with this vintage
beauty foundation but guys you have to
remember that it's just makeup it's just
makeup and people have different
experiences people have different skin
types and skin tones and some things
work for some people and don't work for
others that doesn't make anybody a bad
person so there's that but I have been
trying out the fenty foundation in the
video I tried it with just one of my
normal primers I can't remember which
one I use probably my one from Urban
Decay I'm gonna think I applied it with
a brush so since then I've been trying a
lot of different ways to make this
foundation work and I have not found the
right way yet I think I do like it
better with a damp Beauty Blender versus
a brush when I use a brush it just
seemed like too full coverage on me and
I don't really like full coverage I
don't like the way it looks on me wasn't
a huge fan of that so using a Beauty
Blender and something that's you know a
little bit more hydrating can kind of
kind of bump that coverage down a little
bit more towards like the medium full
which is where I prefer it so definitely
I like using it with a sponge but it's
like I can't find the correct primer to
use with it I even use it without a
primer once because I was like maybe
it's just not meant for a primer I don't
know and that doesn't look good at all
so that that that didn't work out for me
but I have tried it with like
moisturizing hydrating primers and I
still was kind of having that that same
like you it's like it's to Matt on my
face and it actually is tight on my face
in that video I was saying that you
could kind of like really see the lines
around my mouth and you typically don't
see the lines around my mouth the lines
in my forehead yes the lines around my
mouth I typically don't have foundation
settle into them and this was settling
into everything and I just looked not
very great on me I also had a lot of
problems on my nose and I've been seeing
a lot of people saying the same thing
about this foundation is that it doesn't
look great on the nose like I guess my
nose has dry patches on it which I
really don't notice with a lot of other
foundations but this one really
emphasized that so finally when my
moisturizing primers weren't really
doing it yet I pulled out my big guns
the Far Sally rose gold elixir this
stuff makes your face I mean just
insanely dewy and moisturize a lot of
times I will use this with a full
coverage or a very mattifying foundation
because then I think I have the right
mix it wasn't very confusing when I use
this because this is supposed to be a
mattifying foundation and I was like
dewy AF and I wore this combo and my
latest will i buy it video and if so
many people comment it were like what
what foundation are you wearing your
super dewy you're glowing today and I'm
like it's the Finn T Beauty like I'm
what I'm supposed to be mad right no so
I don't know I've been trying I've been
trying so many ways the color match
actually is not bad on me
what was this 2:10 I think it is the
color match is actually not bad I don't
mind the color match and I really don't
think it that it got too much darker on
me it's like I can't find the right
combination and I've been trying a lot
of different ways I've been trying a lot
of different primers
I've been trying different like I don't
usually powder my face I've tried
powdering my face like I can't I can't
get it down with this and I don't I
don't know I'm kind of running out of
ideas but I'm feeling pretty frustrated
because I own how many foundations that
I don't have to do that with I can you
know pretty much going with anything and
that foundation is going to work and
going to look good on my skin so I just
like yeah
make those work for me I don't
for bombed because I want to like it and
I know my first impression wasn't you
know I wasn't like super in love with it
but I was like I keep trying it you know
people were leaving suggestions use the
Beautyblender use a hydrating primer and
I was like check check check I can do
all of that and it's still not working
for me I feel I feel a little
self-conscious when I wear this
foundation and that's why some of the
times that I've tried it it has when
that like just me at home trying it
without having to film I don't know if
I'm going to keep trying this because I
feel like I've given it a lot of chances
and I've tried it a lot of different
ways and like I said I have a lot of
foundations that I prefer more have
pretty normal skin all around I'm not
super dry I'm not super oily I'm not
super acne prone or anything like that I
don't deal with a lot of discoloration
on my skin so I'm pretty normal all the
way around so I don't know I mean I have
dry spots sometimes and you know I guess
my nose is pretty dry because this
emphasized that a lot but other than
that I have pretty normal skin and this
one didn't work out the best for me so
that's a bummer
I tried this bronzer from Estee Lauder
this is the bronze a goddess a bronzer
so I've been obviously wearing this the
past two weeks I'm trying to get a good
feel for it
and I liked it in the video and I was
impressed by the size of this bronzer
it's very large it has a very big mirror
you're getting a lot of product in here
but the more I'm trying it the more I'm
like I don't know I think I have better
bronzers in my collection which I'm
super bummed about mine is in the shape
medium it's 0.74 ounces of product that
you are getting but I feel like it's
almost just a little bit too white on my
skin like I'm really having to go in
there and build it up now I do have my
summer tan still lingering around it
will be fading very soon here so maybe
in the winter I'll come back to this
again and see if it's a little bit
better when my skin is a little bit on
the pastier side then it might be better
but it's surprising to me because this
is me
so it makes me wonder what the light
shade is like so I don't know
unfortunately I ended up not enjoying it
as much as I thought I was going to
based on my first impression so that's
kind of a bummer this was sent to me to
review from octal e and s a letter so
huge thank you there I'll be coming back
to it in the winter time but in the
summer this just doesn't work for me if
you were thinking about picking it up I
would say like go a shade darker than
you'd normally would because it just
doesn't really have that type of
pigmentation that moons that I really
like in my friends are so that was
Caliburn except in the video I tried the
tarts baked blush book this was sent to
me from a subscriber friend which was
really amazing I was really excited to
be able to try this out I know a lot of
people have been really curious about
these myself included I have never tried
a big blush book from tarte before and I
was always a little bit leery because
you hear a lot about holiday releases
not being the same quality as the brands
normal releases if that makes sense
so this I had used this before one other
time when I was filming that video and
so I kind of gave some feedback in there
but I said that I don't think that this
is the same quality as the Tarte
Amazonian clay blushes but I still think
that they're really good and I still
agree with that I have used almost every
single blush out of the palette now I
think it's only this top one that I
haven't used I've used all the other
blushes I've used the highlighter quite
a bit and I'm really impressed with
everything so I think that's really good
the entire book is $60 and you're
getting seven different blushes and one
highlighter do you think the Amazonian
clays are just like a little bit better
but though these aren't that far off and
I don't feel like this would be a waste
of money
you're definitely gonna be seeing me
using this quite a bit like in tutorials
and upcoming videos I always link all
the makeup I'm wearing in my description
box you can always check there if you're
wondering what I'm wearing and I think
that you're gonna see the tarte big
black book 3 quite a bit because i have
been very impressed with it the blushes
are super nice easily blendable easily
pigmented and that highlighter really is
pretty you do have to build up the
highlight just a little bit and I
suggest using a
more dense brush versus a fluffy brush
for that highlighter because it just
needs a little bit of help again just a
little bit of help but really nothing
too bad and I still think this would be
a good value so I've been pretty
impressed with the turn baked blush book
3 I gotta give it to him I did try a new
brow product in that video as well and
I'm very happy to say that this kind of
thumbs up for me this is from Estee
Lauder so the bronzer didn't work out
the best for me but this brow a
multitasker has really been doing good
things for me I've really been enjoying
this so I was a little confused at first
in the video because when you take the
caps off you have your spoolie on one
end like a normal brow pencil and then
you have your brow product on the other
end brow product is kind of a teardrop
to kind of diamond shape comparable to
like the benefit goof proof pencil but
then you can actually twist off the
middle and you have a brow powder in
there and I was a little hesitant in the
video I was a little concerned but I
tried it out and I got so many
compliments on my brows in that video
and I was like ok I'm gonna try this
brand multi tasker again so I did and
and I did my brows and I was like I
don't know I feel like they look ok but
I feel like they don't really look that
good when I was like wait a second I
didn't put the powder on them yet
I think the powder is what puts this
brow product over the edge and I'm so
excited and I'm still weirded out that
I'm excited about a brow product this
much but I think the powder really gives
it and umph because every time that I've
done that I'm like ok I'm just gonna go
in real quick and just do my brows with
just the pencil and then I kind of look
back and I'm like I'm just gonna put the
powder over it and I've actually gone
into this pencil just for that powder
when I've used different brow pencils
because I feel like the brow powder is
really like a game-changer for me
I've been reaching for this so often the
shade that I got was in blonde it's also
sent to me from octillion Estee Lauder
for review so a huge thank you to them
because I actually ended up really
really liking this I did look it up at
all because it's available there and
it's $29 which is expensive for a brow
product but I get what they're saying
that you're not just getting a pencil
you're also getting
I know I get it probably still want to
buy it for a discount but I would
totally repurchase this on my own I was
really really impressed with it and that
has me so excited item I tried in there
it was a lipstick this is from morphe
this is the collaboration with Orpha and
this is the liquid lipstick in vinyl I
did look at the morphe website because I
believe that you do have to buy this as
I said you have to buy the liquid
lipstick and then also the lip liner and
this set is 15 dollars this lipstick
cool in that video I put it on I
immediately got excited it gave me 95 it
gave me fall vibes I was like yes I
absolutely love this color but truly I
think the more field like what lipsticks
are really really good I put it on in
that video is probably about 1 or 2
o'clock or so afternoon I'm gonna say
and then I went the entire rest of the
day I ate a snack I ate it some more and
then I ate I believe was Chinese food
for dinner and then I sat down at 7:30
to film my youtube live didn't touch up
at all and I had absolutely no issues it
still looked absolutely fine I didn't do
a touch-up it these are very
long-lasting they don't crack
uncomfortably strange on the lips they
hold up really well and this was no
exception I do have two other morphe
liquid lipsticks so I was curious to see
if this one was going to be you know the
same formula companies are always
switching around formulas and stuff I
was curious if it would be the same as
those two and it definitely is so I was
really happy with this I definitely say
give more filled up sticks a try I think
they are really good if you love those
fall 90s types of shades like those
brick red shades check out the one from
Orpha because this is a beautiful shade
I will be reaching for this so much
involved I guess so that is everything
that I tried out in my trying new makeup
video about two weeks ago those are all
of my follow up reviews and definitely
the top choices for me was that morphe
lipstick and the Estee Lauder
brow pencil and my biggest fails were
the Fenty foundation and then by far
that NYX eyeshadow palette I would love
to know if anybody else has picked up
the next elements eyeshadow palettes
because I think there are six different
palettes I'd love to know if anybody
else has gotten one if anybody has had
the same experience SP I know what you
think in the comments down below
everything that I talked about will be
linked I will have the
video listed down below if you guys want
to see me trying out anymore a new
makeup if you like those types of videos
let me know in the comments you guys did
enjoy this video I hope that you will
give it a thumbs up I hope that you will
also consider subscribing before you go
and I'll see you guys in tomorrow's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
