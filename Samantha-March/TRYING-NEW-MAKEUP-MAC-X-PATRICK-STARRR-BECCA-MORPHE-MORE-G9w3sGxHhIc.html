today's video is going to be trying new
makeup video so I have some new products
here that I am pretty excited to try out
I have some new items from the Mac and
Patrick Starr the summer collection that
they came out with I also have a blush
palette here from pur cosmetics I have
the new Becca highlighter in Dreamsicle
I also have some new lashes to test out
and then also new lipsticks from morphe
so we want to try out today so I'm gonna
go ahead and get started alright we are
zoomed in got my ears on we are ready to
go so I do already have a foundation
concealer powder contour on and then
also my brows since I didn't have
anything new with that so a first up I
am going to start off with my eyes and
I'm going to use this new palette from
the Mac and Patrick Starr collection I
didn't even know that they were coming
out with a new collection I did get it
since the impure which I was so excited
about I didn't even know they were
coming out with another one so huge
congratulations Patrick Starr for
working again with MAC Cosmetics I think
this is the third collaboration now so
that is a pretty frickin awesome but
says here summer start there is two
different lip glosses there's an
eyeshadow palette there's a bronzing
powder and a face powder okay then so
when is this going to be available it
says June 7th act a Mac locations so if
I can find it online I will go ahead and
link everything it down below so I'm
gonna go in with the eye shadow palette
first and this is in heat stroke so the
packaging on it is very cute and then
here is what the inside looks like so
I'm actually gonna do a pretty like
neutral look because the new morphe
lipsticks that came out are all red so I
think I'm gonna do like neutral brown
smokey eyes and then a red lip I think
it's kind of what I'm leading towards
here so I'm first gonna come into the
shade right here with the morphe g24
it's just a big blending brush I'm I do
have my eye primer down and I also have
it set so this kind of looks like a
peachy it's giving me some peachy vibes
but I'm just going to go ahead and we're
that into the crease I'm just pick up a
smaller blending brush come in with this
shade so this is the Sigma e25 and then
I'm going to Pat this on the outer part
of the eye and then slowly also start to
blend it into the crease then I'm just
going to kind of like lightly tap my
brush in the inner corner of my eye as
well and then blend it out I think I'm
gonna do any shimmer up here as of right
now I'm not going to so I'm just gonna
go ahead and make sure everything is
really nice and blended together so so
far the quality of the shadows I really
enjoy I mean I have a couple of the
other palettes that Patrick Starr's done
with Mac and I enjoyed the quality and
all of them there was zero fallout on my
face everything was really easy to blend
I mean I only use two shadows so far but
again I mean I've tried these in the
past I've tried neutrals I've tried the
colorful palettes and everything has has
really impressed me this is where I'm
going to leave the eyes right now I
think I'm gonna do a little bit of my
lash line work since I already do have
my foundation and concealer on and then
try to side if I want to do any shimmer
or if I want to do a liner or just do
lashes I haven't really decided yet I
just I just start filling it and to put
a little bit of black liner from the
balm into my waterline and then I think
I'm just going to smudge those two
colors that I've already used I'm gonna
put those on the lower lash line I think
I'm gonna do the darker color first and
then use the lighter color to really
make sure that it's blended out
okay so I think I just say that I do
want to do a winged liner so I'm going
to do that off-camera
I'm just those are kind of the vibes I'm
feeling especially knowing that I'm
going to top it all off with a red lip I
just feel like it'll look really nice
with a winged liner since we're doing
something a little bit more neutral
because I mean obviously that eyeshadow
palette that's what I had to do but I'm
also gonna put on a pair of lashes and
these are new to me these are from a
velvet 59 these are the luxury vegan
lashes in Belle so I got these sent to
me from actually so thank you to Velvet
59 and actually for sending these to me
so here is what the style Belle looks
like so I'm excited about these I'm
ever tried this brand at all so I'm
pretty stoked to try this I'm gonna have
to like cut in trim these since I just
got them in the mail so I'm gonna go
ahead and do liner and lashes off-camera
that will come on back okay so I added
some liner and then also the lashes from
Velvet 59 so a couple of thoughts
um one I have done winged liner in a
while and winged liners like that thing
we're like if you don't constantly
practice it and do it you kind of lose
it so I was struggling a little bit but
I knew these lashes were going to be
really large so I thought I needed to
offset the size of the lashes and make
sure to have a wing especially as since
for keeping the eye so neutral so I
added some liquid liner and then I put
on these lashes and unfortunately
they're they're one of those lashes that
are just they're they're too big for me
and I don't know how to describe it the
best but like my eyes are different
shapes and sizes but for me it means
that sometimes if I have lashes kind of
in this particular style or really like
large dramatic lashes I can't pull them
off because they look so different on my
eyes like can you can you tell with me
looking straight on at the camera it to
me it looks like I have two different
pairs of lashes on and that's a really
common thing it's why you don't see me a
lot with these kind of super dramatic
lashes on because it's just I just can't
pull them off with how my eyes are
shaped so I was really trying I was
taking them off and putting them back on
and I was I cut them down even more you
know thinking maybe I needed to just
like keep cutting them down but
unfortunately it's gonna be one of those
styles that I just can't pull off
because of my particular shapes so oh
man I'm bummed about that but for the
actual lashes they were easy to put on I
really liked the bands on them the
adhesive was going on just great they
were really easy to pop on like I was
even taking them on and off mostly just
trying to get them to line up to look
better not on and off because I was
having troubles because they weren't
staying I mean the inner corners went
down right away I'm so so bummed let me
know if you've tried any of these lashes
and what your favorite style would be
but the show must go on
alright let's keep going
what are we trying next next we are
gonna try we're going to switch over to
the face because eyes are pretty much
done now so so switching over to the
face I got this
also from octoly this is from Pierre it
is the four in one blush book I just got
a bunch of stuff in the mail today so I
haven't even opened this guy yet but
I've actually been hearing really good
things about this it's $36 you can get
it on the pure website and I believe
it's also available at Ulta as well so
of course everything that I'm using will
be linked down below okay so this is
what the inside looks like whoo she's
pretty okay so here is what the blush
book looks like the blushes are super
intriguing to me I don't know the bus
with are super soft I don't know the
best way to try to get oh wow these are
very very creamy okay so here is what
the swatches from the blush book look
like wow that's pretty crazy this one is
insane
okay it says a stunning array of cool to
warm up pigments the four in one blush
book sculpt shapes and defines the
cheekbones the matte and shimmer
formulas are richly pigmented I would
agree and buildable to provide sheer to
bold color for a universal blush
wardrobe for all skin tones okay wow I
was not expecting that I would love to
put that on my eyes that's really pretty
and like deke for like even when I dip
my finger in it into it it was so darn
creamy so I think wow I'm kind of near
I'm gonna go in with a light hand for
sure I'm gonna take this a second one
right here and I'm just gonna try to
like lightly apply that to the
cheekbones make sure I tap off any extra
that looks nice don't want to overdo it
I feel like in a couple of my last like
first impressions my blush my blush was
very intense so I kind of try to be more
careful here so that is what that second
blush looks like I'm really excited for
this palette and to keep trying it out
because wow there are the swatches again
from
palate that was really pretty I like
kind of the different array that you get
and like it said it was warm tones and
cool tones Wow ah first impressions I
mean I'll come back in a couple of weeks
to give a review and everything like I
normally do with my first impressions
but first impressions I was not
expecting that and that's pretty cool
so I almost forgot to do my bronzer I
was hiding underneath the Mac and
Patrick Starr little file leaflet thing
that I had but I do want to do bronzer I
usually do bronzer first but we'll see
how we do so this is the give me life
bronzing powder from the Mac and Patrick
Starr collection I'm not sure if it'll
be too warm on me but we will go ahead
and see able to swatch it here next to
the blushes oh okay I don't I don't
think it will be too warm there's a
swatch of that bronzer there so I'm just
going to kind of like lately ooh this
one has a mirror too so that's nice so
I'm just going to kind of lightly try to
blend that in with the blush like I said
I normally do my bronzer first but whew
I think my eyes got me all out of whack
there for a moment and then it was
hiding under that paper so we'll just
try our best here and so it runs a
little on the forehead as well it looks
like a much more subtle bronzer than I
thought when I first opened it I just
wondered if maybe it would be a little
bit too dark or too warm for me but it's
actually more subtle than I thought but
it is also buildable so that's nice I
think that looks really pretty actually
I actually really like that bronzer and
I thought it went on really smoothly as
well I like that one so next up I have a
highlight to try and I'm really excited
about this this is from Becca it's the
nude Dreamsicle highlight I also got
this Afra Mach delay so big thank you to
Becca actally I was really excited when
I got approved for this one if you guys
aren't familiar with octillery it's a
site that kind of connects bloggers and
brands they put certain items up for
like in your free store it's called and
then you can write in a proposal
basically saying you know I want to try
this product because this is where I'll
feature the product and all that and
brands can either accept or decline to
send products to you and then you get
them in exchange for a review it's not
like sponsored you don't get paid for it
or anything you're just getting the
products in exchange for a review so
it's a pretty cool site and it's it's
letting me try out a lot of products in
this video so I'll have a link for it
down below I mentioned this in a will I
buy a video and I said I was excited
about it and I thought it looked pretty
but I wasn't sure if it would look great
with my skin tone and it's $38 so I was
kind of like blue but when I saw it come
up with my freestyle I was like oh my
gosh if you would send this to me like I
would love to try it out to see how it
looks on my skin so we're gonna give it
a shot so this is what the highlight
looks like it's beautiful packaging you
know the little stuffs are like normal
but with white and beautiful packaging
in there so I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch it first that looks really nice
okay so there's that and then see if I
can swatch it down here oh that looks
really pretty
that looks pretty I'm just worried I
don't know if it's gonna be like to
oranjee I don't know we'll just give it
a try well that's what this video is all
about okay so I'm going to use my lucky
brush it's pretty lucky because in case
this is like really intense but also
like not the best way sometimes this
brush can kind of help tone down the
highlights so I'm just gonna swirl it in
there tap it off and then apply to the
tops of my cheekbones so I think that
looks really pretty I actually don't
think that looks that it pulls more gold
on me from what I can tell in person I'm
not sure how how it will be in camera on
camera I've got sometimes it can be a
little bit different but on me I feel
like it's pulling just more more golden
which I do not mind I really actually
enjoy gold highlights so I actually
quite like that and it's really smooth
and it shows up really easily just like
with all the BEC highlights that I've
tried so that's awesome I actually
really really like that it's almost like
a peachy gold oh I like that a lot I'm
gonna run just a little bit down the
center of my nose and then just a little
bit on the tip of my nose and that's
really all I do for highlight anymore I
actually really liked that I was so
unsure about
highlight like I was even questioning
what brush to use because I was like if
it just looks like I put like an orange
streak on my cheek that's gonna be weird
but I actually think that looks pretty
darn good
that is the Becca Dreamsicle highlights
okay I'm just gonna spray my face a
little bit to lock everything in and
then we're gonna finish up with a lip
color and then we're done oh base I just
need to finish up with my lip color so
morphe just came out with new lipsticks
these are bullet lipsticks and they are
all matte red lipsticks so they did send
me all five of them you can get them out
on the morphe website they are nine
dollars each so I picked out two that I
kind of was going between one is simi
and it's described as a classic red
which is this one right here and then
the other one that I was also debating
about this one is called lover and it's
described as a watermelon red and then
there's a swatch of that one right there
I think I'm going to go with the
watermelon one just cuz it kind of like
it reminds me of summer just slowly
based on the name okay I'm not a huge
red lipstick wear but that's it since I
knew I had a red lipstick from morphe
that's why I wanted to do a neutral eye
and that palette was really neutral so I
was like but but the brown smokey eye
with the wing and the big lashes and
then to finish it off with a red lip I
feel like it's kind of like a classical
look so I'm gonna go ahead and see oh
okay
they're they're very bad so I'm not the
best with matte lipsticks I could tell
right away it's kind of hard to apply so
this might take me just a little bit
there not just with any matte lipstick
really they're not super creamy to apply
yourself go ahead and try to fill in
here it's a little more orange than I
thought it was gonna be okay that took
me a hot seconds foot on I do like the
color but it's very bright it's pulling
a little bit more Orange II to me in
person I'm not sure how it is on camera
but it's kind of like an orange II red
but it's really pretty I like the color
and I like the color with this you know
but I look that I have going on as well
it's very very matte though if you
really like
Matt bullet lipsticks you're going to
get that with this one for me personally
it's not my favorite to apply I find it
just really hard because it's not creamy
it's it's Matt it doesn't skip a lot on
my lips which is good but at the same
time like especially like lining my top
lips and stuff I think it would be
easier to do that first with a lip liner
and then fill in with this because it's
just really hard to get that kind of
like smooth application with these but
that's you know that's what I notice a
lot with Matt bullet lipsticks so I
really like to cut the color of this but
I just I don't think it's gonna be my
favorite formula but I'll try this one
and I'll try the other one that i
swatched as well and then I'll probably
put the rest in a giveaway I'm just
because I know it won't be my favorite
formula and again I don't wear red lips
a ton so you know it's better for me to
just keep a couple and try out and be
able to review and then just kind of
like spread the love as well but after
that guys that is going to do it for
this edition of trying out new makeup
okay so this is the a final look before
today's a trying out new makeup so just
a quick recap through everything I did
like the Mac and Patrick star palette I
figured I would I mean I only use two
shades out of here so how much can I
really tell you and I didn't use the
shimmers it's it's a very neutral
palette I do kind of wish maybe it was a
little bit more colorful for summer but
the last palette that he did with his
club with Mac was super colorful and
there was lots of you know there's two
different palettes but pinks and purples
and blues and things like that but I
just I kind of wish there was just a
little bit more color but you know I'll
try it out the other shades the shimmer
shades and come back and let you know
what I think of it but these have all
been really good quality so I'm assuming
it will be the same across the board who
really did like the bronzer in here I
thought it was really smooth and it easy
to blend bronzer and gives you kind of
like that natural bronze so I also
really enjoyed that one the blush book
from pure actually really surprised me
I'm excited to use this more and to try
some of these other shades in here these
are very vibrant I mean I could tell
from swatching and I tried to use such a
light hand when putting these on but
this
looks like a pretty darn promising blush
book so I'm pretty excited to keep
trying that one out as well and
unfortunately a Miss for me was the
Velvet 59 lashes again the actual lashes
applied really easily I really like the
band on it so I want to try some other
styles in here but Belle unfortunately
is just gonna be a style that doesn't
work well with my eyes but really easy
to put on so I want to try some more of
these and then Dreamsicle had me really
surprised I thought this was going to be
a Miss for sure for my skin tone and I
am so pleasantly surprised it's just as
good as any of the other Beca highlights
that I've tried off of you know first
time applying it and I love that color
so much I love the gold and the peach so
that's friggin awesome
and then the morphe lipsticks you know I
just I don't think they're gonna be my
favorite formula I like the color that I
put on but matte bullet lipsticks are
just on my favorite so there's just kind
of a wrap up of everything that I use
today I hope you enjoy to see me try out
some of these new products let me know
what has your interest what have you
already picked up but other than that
that's gonna do it for today's video
check back in a couple weeks for my
update with reviews on everything but
other than that if you guys did enjoy

thumbs up I hope that you'll also
