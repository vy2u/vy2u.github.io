thank you for watching so I'm very
excited for today's video because it's
going to be a makeup tutorial it's going
to be on this like matte eye nude kind
of glossy lip look but really I am using
a lot of new product some products that
were sent to me and some that I have
purchased for myself and I actually did
not realize it until like halfway
through that I was like oh wait I'm
using a lot of like these new products
because I actually am also going to be
filming a like new and beauty fab or
fail video so I thought it was kind of
fun because in this video you'll get a
makeup tutorial you'll see me using a
lot of the items that I'm going to talk
about in the fabric fail in this video
not all of them but some of them you
will see me actually being able to put
them on and apply them how they apply
some products that I use in this video
is the very first time that I'm using
them so that was kind of fun but then
you will also get a follow-up full
review video coming in the future
and I realized that I have not been
doing enough reviews on here like I'm
doing hauls and I'm showing unboxings
but then I'm not like a following up
with reviews which actually was really
upsetting to me because one of the
reasons why I started my channel is
because I'm a reviewer I started a
review blog back in 2009 and that's what
I've always done is review products and
somehow that has managed to split my
mind so I'm going to be trying so much
harder to make sure that I do at least
one review video a week going over new
products that I've bought products that
have been sent Influenster boxes I'm
gonna get back on the reviews I promise
because I get a lot of like follow up
questions about products so more review
videos are coming also this look today
that I did is very much inspired by one
of my favorite youtubers who is Amanda n
singh she did a matte eye look a couple
of weeks ago and as I was watching the
beginning of the video I was like I have
to try to recreate this look and it
actually worked out so well because
Smashbox actually sent me a few of their
new like summer releases and one of it
is an all matte eyeshadow palette and
she used something kind of similar she
used a matte eyeshadow palette in her
video and so I thought well I'm gonna
take inspiration from that and kind of
her technique and see what I can come up
with using the Smashbox palette so I had
a lot of fun doing it and I just
love Manas videos I definitely wanted to
say this is inspired from her and her
technique and all that but I'm very much
new in makeup and still very much
learning in the biggest way that I
learned how to do makeup was on YouTube
and from these youtubers of that I
watched so a lot of times my looks are
like repeating videos that I've seen I'm
just kind of putting my own little spin
on it of course we all have like
different shaped eyes things like that
so they don't ever always quite turn out
the exact same but it's fun to be able
to have some sort of idea inspiration
when I'm doing my makeup because since
I'm still so new it really does help me
out but I did want to say that it's
definitely inspired from a vanda's
tutorial and I love the look but I've
done this look probably four to five
times now with this new Smashbox palette
and I just love the matte eye and this
look actually it might seem complicated
but it is so so simple and after the
first time I did it and really
understood where delay shadows and how
to work with the tape
it's become one of my go-to looks right
now so I've just been absolutely loving
it so I hope this tutorial will kind of
inspire you guys as well to try
something new I'm excited to share all
these new makeup items with you and be
on the lookout for that fiber fail video
that will be coming soon but I hope you
guys like this video I hope you will
give it a thumbs up and subscribe before
you go and let's jump into it I guess so
first I'm going to conceal my eyes using
the maybelline instant age rewind
placing that underneath the eye and also
on my eyelid to act as a primer and
using my Sephora 57 brush to buff that
in then I'm just going to take some good
old scotch tape and a trick that I like
to do is put it on the back of my hand
and peel it off like two to three times
just to get rid of some of the tackiness
so it doesn't really tear and pull at
you when you eventually take the tape
off because I've done it and it hurts so
I'm going to place the tape on the wing
of my eye and then also put it
underneath my lashes don't tape down
your lashes because that hurts too
because I've done it too I don't use
tape a lot because I find it a little
bit hard to work with but once you get
it right and it looks good I'm coming in
it with this new Smashbox photo mat eye
palette which I've absolutely been upset
with I'm taking my morphe m4 for one
brush and picking up this like warm
brown color and sweeping that back and
forth into the crease and a little bit
above the crease and just blending it
out and then I'm going to pick up this
taupe gray shade and my Sigma e25 brush
and I'm blending that right beneath the
first color that we put down still in
the crease but a little bit below that
color and then blending them together to
give it like a nice gradient effect and
taking the shadow all the way out to the
tape so that's what it's there for then
I'm gonna pick up this like deep and
brown chocolate color and I am using my
Sigma e30 9 brush and focusing this
color mostly on the outer V of my eye a
little bit toward the lashline and then
when I have less product I'm blending
that into the inner corner of my eye and
I'm gonna do this a lot since this is
such a dark brown color I like to build
it up instead of putting a lot of
product onto my brush and then trying to
blend it out that is really hard so when
using darker colors I will just repeat
this process as many times as I need and
every time you see a clip cut that's me
getting more product and blending it out
but that's just the easiest way to do it
when working with darker colors and then
I'm going to grab this beige shade in
the middle and my Sigma E 54 brush and
I'm just placing that on to the lid and
then I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna blend
the two colors just to make sure it's
blended and then you will also see me
once again come back with the beige
shade and I just do this again as many
times as I need until I feel like both
colors are where I want them to be and
then I'm going to grab my morphe 18
brush and I'm going to use the dark
brown color and just again putting it on
the outer V and the lashline and then
blending it together just to kind of
give it a more like defined look with
this color and I really like how it came
out and then I'm going into the black
from the palette and I'm picking up the
brush that's in there there's a really
nice double ended brush that comes with
this palette including the one that I
like to use for the liner so this is
where the tape really comes in handy
because I'm just using that tape as a
guide and acting like I'm making a wing
liner this is the owner liner that I'm
using I'm not coming in with like a
liquid or a gel liner and I think it
just gives a really cool effect to the
eyes and then once you peel off the tape
voila and I sharp line eyes are looking
good so moving on to face I'm gonna
prime it with the Too Faced primed and
poreless and prime at my skin for
foundation I'm using the Maybelline a
better skin foundation and my Sigma of
80 brush and I'm just buffing this into
the skin and then after a foundation I'm
going to move on to a highlight and
contour and I am using this new product
from NYX it's their sculpt and highlight
face duo I do have a full video review
and first impression of this product and
I just have really really been liking it
so because I did already conceal my eyes
earlier before we did the eye makeup I'm
using this as a highlight shade so I'm
placing it underneath my eyes and then
I'm also going to put it on the center
of my forehead down the bridge of my
nose a little on my Cupid's bow and then
also some on my chin and I'm gonna use
my damp Beauty Blender this is the nude
Beauty Blender and I'm just going to
buff that out
and then to set the highlight shade I am
using the Rimmel stay matte translucent
powder and my eldest Mel tapered brush
as usual and just using that to set the
highlight and then for contour I'm just
going to use the other side of this next
product and contour out my cheekbones
and I'm also gonna use some on my
forehead and then also just a little bit
down the bridge of my nose or I'm sorry
on the sides of my nose I don't hate my
nose so I don't do nose contouring a
whole lot but I actually really like
doing it with this product because I
think it makes it easier but again I
don't do anything crazy because I feel
like if I did it would probably just end
up looking really weird and then I'm
just going to flip my Beauty Blender
over use the other side to blend out the
contour shade I love how well this
product blends cream contouring can
sometimes intimidate me because I'm
afraid I'm gonna have weird lines on my
face but I really really do like this
product from NYX and after I've done at
my forehead I just take my fingers to
blend in the contour on my nose and I
just like that I feel like it makes it
look just a little bit more defined like
nothing crazy I'm not making my nose
disappear here and then to bronze up the
skin and kind of set that contour i'm
using the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer and my morphe m5 3-0 brush I
just picked up this bronzer and wow it
is beautiful and I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques this is a blush brush but I
just do a quick quick little swipe just
making sure everything is blended and
we're looking put together and no crazy
harsh lines on the face I'm gonna use
from remote their exaggerated liner in
the nude and put that onto the waterline
I like using the nude to kind of open up
the eyes a little bit more and then
grabbing that taupe shade it was the
second shader that what we went in with
and my morphe 18 brush and sweeping them
down onto the lower lash line I also
gonna pick up the dark chocolate shade
in my Sigma e25 brush and also sweep
that on the lower lash line just to give
it like a really smoky blended out type
of look and then for blush I'm coming in
with this also another new product from
Smashbox their blush and highlight
palettes and I'm combining the two blush
shades in here
and I love the way this blush looks I
love it
I was using my morphe floor brush and I
got this new highlight the glow stick
from Marc Jacobs I got it in influenster
voxbox this is my first time using it
and look at that just look just look at
that it is so stunning I also forgot to
say off camera I did apply some
Maybelline master precise liner and the
Ardell wispy lashes which I'm obsessed
with and then to finish it off with the
lips I'm using the new Maybelline Color
jolt and stripped down really love these
products if you do not have these
lippies yet I highly recommend them and
then to finish off the look I'm just
going to spray my face with a little bit
of the Mario Badescu rose water spray
and our look is complete I hope you
enjoyed it guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
