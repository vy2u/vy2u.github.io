so pumped of for today's video because
this is going to be trying out some of
your favorite makeup so I am trying out
some of my subscribers have favorite
makeup products in this video I have
been asking on Instagram Twitter
snapchat what are your favorites I've
been making my list I've combined some
of the products I've actually got some
products sent to me from you guys that
you wanted to see in this video so I am
just all kinds of excited to film this
and see if any of your favorites
turn into my favorites I'm also doubly
excited for this video because it's
going to be another collab video with my
friend live from live loves her makeup
I'm so excited I'm so stoked to see her
video and see what her subscribers
wanted to see her put in that video and
just see how her look turns out so of
course lives channel will be linked to
down below I highly suggest you go over
there and check her out she's one of my
favorite friends here on YouTube I
obviously have no makeup on my face
because I'm going to be trying out some
of your favorites so without further ado
why don't I go ahead and get started
alrighty so like I normally do I am
going it to start off with the eyes I am
so excited to finally use this palette
oh yeah
it's the color pop yes the please
palette so this is a favorite of so many
this has been such a hard palette
together I've been restocking it and
selling out like crazy I was so shocked
I got a packager from my friend Candice
and she sent this one to me and I was
like no way they open the box and saw
this I was like thank you thank you so
much and I figured this would be the
perfect video to try out finally the
color pop yes please palette so first I
do see a matte white shade in the
palette which is fantastic I did put a
primer on so I'm just going to go ahead
and use this shade and dust it all over
my lid using it the Mota metallic super
crease brush so next up I'm going to
take the second shade in the palette
with the morphe g24 blending brush and
I'm just going to sweep that into the
crease this looks to be like a matte
orange shade I really have no idea what
I look I'm going to do with this palette
we're just going to start
and see what we come up with that shade
is very pigmented very easy to blend but
I am getting a lot I'll fall out on the
palate I don't know if you guys could
see that but there's a lot of boho and
then I'm gonna take a little bit of the
red on the same brush and I'm also going
to put that one and into my crease and
then blend those two together okay so
far I'm gonna use two shades but I am
very impressed with this palette I can
see why it's been getting so much
attention like not only do I love the
shade selection and it's so good for
fall but even that red very pigmented
but very easy to blend
sometimes when shadows are so pigmented
they can kind of lose their blend
ability but hmm I'm having no issues so
far woo hoo I do want to test a shimmer
shade in here I think I'm gonna grab
this one from the last row I'm going to
use the sigma e55 I'm gonna start off
with nuts
I'm getting my brush damp at all just to
see how it applies well that's pretty
it's not quite as intense as I want it
so I'm gonna go ahead and spray my brush
so I just got my brush a little bit damp
with a setting spray so it kind of gives
it more so once I have that the shimmer
down I'm going to come in with the first
brush and just make sure it is all
blended together I like to put down
these initial shades first before I go
on with my face because I do have some
fall out around my eyes not too much so
far so far so good for the yes please
spell it already I'm gonna switch over
to the face I am so excited to try this
foundation because I hear so many good
things about it this is the elf flawless
finish a foundation my friend Mickey
sent this to me and I knew I had to try
it out in this video she raves about
this foundation so much she does have a
YouTube channel so I will have her link
down below as well I was so excited she
got me the shade sand so we will see we
will see how it works I'm in let that
like weird zone right now we're like I
kinda still have my summer Tampa like
not really the winter Ghost is about to
creep up on us
the glass bottle - this feels like so
fancy 4l I love it so I'm going to use
my Sigma huh flat kabuki this is the f80
this is the pink one if you guys haven't
seen yet Sigma came out with a limited
edition of pink faad brush because a
portion of the proceeds from sales of
this brush goes to breast cancer
research link down below I am an
affiliate with Sigma so my discount code
is Samantha typically you can save money
on your entire Sigma order but with this
brush you can't use a discount code with
it because you want the full amount
donate it which i think is fantastic if
you were to order this brush and other
items you can still use the code it
would just be applied to the other items
in your order not the brush but I wanted
to make sure I mention that because I
think that's awesome October is almost
coming to an end I kober's Breast Cancer
Awareness Month and I feel like it's
really important the first thing and
then I noticed is that it does have
quite a fragrance to it it's almost like
a I've been consider that to be I don't
know almost like a floral fragrance okay
so I have it blended out so far so good
I would say the coverage is medium which
is usually my favourites coverage for
foundation like I can still see a guy
have a red mark here under my eye that's
always there like I can still see some
of those like I can still see my skin
basically it's not a super full coverage
foundation but it's enough coverage that
I like it I feel like it smooths
everything out very well it blended out
very easily very quickly I like the
shape match to me so so far so good I'll
apply the rest of my makeup of course
and see how we look with it but I like
the finish that it gives the skin it's
not like overly back but it's also not
super dewy hmm so I like that
that's the elf a flawless finish
foundation courtesy of Mickey thank you
so much up it's so excited to try this
out and let's keep on rolling so next up
for concealer I remember and it asked
this on Twitter what's your favorite can
see like what would you you know want to
see me use I got a lot of like shake
pave Maybelline fit me the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer is that I love but
that I've already owned and tried out
Mel wrote in and she said the benefit
Boyne concealer so I had just jotted
that down on my list and then a few
seconds later Shay from that girl Shay
also responded to me on Twitter and said
the benefit boying and I was like I love
Shay I love her Channel
I'll link it down below I love watching
her videos I think she is so much fun
and she follows me on Twitter and like
sometimes she tweets to me and I'm like
every time she does I get so excited so
when I saw her also say benefit boy I
was like okay for sure I got to do it so
thank you to Shay and also thank you to
Mel for letting me know that this is
your favorite concealer they did have a
couple different I don't know if I knew
this they have a couple different ones
of the Boyne concealer and I chose the
brightening concealer because that's
what I tend to go for with my concealers
I like the brightening effect so I'm
pretty excited to try this out I got
this at Sephora I think it was in like
the $20 range so this is what it looks
like so it's in a pot form so I'm just
gonna go ahead I'm gonna put some on my
brush and then apply it to my under eye
because I don't like putting my fingers
in makeup so I just am using my Sephora
57 brush and I'm just going to tap some
on to my under eyes okay I feel like so
far so good can you guys don't tell the
difference the concealer is on this side
I feel like you can definitely see that
it's brighter and then this side not not
quite so much I like the finish that it
gave it covered up that red mark pretty
well I also like that it's bright now I
just feel like when you use a
brightening concealer it almost kind of
like lifts the eye area as well it just
makes you look more awake which I
appreciate
alrighty so I have my concealer on and
set so far so good with the benefit
boying feel like I'm looking kind of
kind of ghostly again so we need to put
some color onto our face so I'm going to
move on to some that contour and blush
and I'm so excited my friend and Tinka
suggested these on Twitter and I was
like I have been eyeing these for so
long I wanted to do it and Tinka girl
you made me make this purchase so these
are new items from Make Up For Ever they
came out with these like little
myzel they have like singles duo's trios
and they are available on the Sephora
website so I picked up this one I wanted
this one at first released but this was
the like contour bronzer a shade that I
wanted and it kept selling out it is s 1
1 2 so I finally got that one and also
when I was placing my support order this
was actually a 100-point perk and it was
the blush color that I wanted to get so
I was like oh my gosh how well does that
work out and this is an s2 one for me
forever has some funny names but these
will be linked down below I was
originally going to do a trio and also
add a highlight but the highlight was
almost like a unanimous thing so many
people voted for the exact same
highlight so that will be coming up soon
so I was just going to do the duo
because you get a bit of a discount if
you purchase the full sizes with the
magnetic pan that's gonna do that but
once I saw this was a 100-point perk I
was like well I might as well save it
was like 20 or 25 dollars or something
like that I was like I'll go ahead and
save it and just cash in a hundred
points for the blush but I'm very
excited to try these oh thank you girl
I'm pumped thanks for making me finally
do this and realizing that the shade was
back so I'm gonna go ahead and try this
one first and I am going to use another
mode of metallic brush and this one is
the contour brush so let's go ahead and
get some color back in here I'm these
for a while I'm pretty sure I put these
in a will a bite video and I did say
that I wanted to get them but when this
contour shade was sold out for so long I
was like that's the one I'm like the
most excited for so I was happy to see
it back feel like this contour shade I
feel like it looks really really good on
my skin it's like it's not too
overbearing of a contour shade it's not
too deep it's not orange it's not it
just looks great so I'm so excited to
finally have this one for makeup forever
oh I did realize as I was going along
that I did get a bronzer because I just
asked I work I can recall asking on
Twitter for face palettes because I
wanted something you know maybe with the
contour or the bronzer of the blush or
the highlight together and that's why I
picked out these ones from Make Up For
Ever because it was the contour and the
blush but then I forgot
the bronzer hello Samantha uh-huh you
guys let me know what your favorite
bronzers are in the description box down
below and if you want to see part two
because I can totally do that but that's
my bad but I did just get this from pure
cosmetics of steeped contour Diaries so
it has these shades in here so I'm just
gonna grab but I think this middle one
which is called passion and use it as a
bronzer I did get this sent to me from
octa Lee and I haven't tried it out yet
so it'll still be a first impression but
oh my goodness I'm so crazy it does have
a mirror which is really helpful I'm
going to use another mode a metallic
brush and this is the buffer brush so
I'm just gonna grab that middle shade
and just bronze up the skin a real quick
I'll also leave this one link down below
if you guys have tried this one and you
really like it let me know as well but
so silly I can't believe that I forgot a
bronzer especially because I love
bronzing so far so good with that
bronzer and I still mmm
still really digging that make up
forever contour shade as well but that
looks like a really nice bronzer so I
gonna use the middle shade which is
passionate from the pier at contour
diary's okay let's go ahead and hop back
over into tinkas selection because she
also suggests that the blush so again my
shape was the two one for again this is
the 100-point perk so that's why it
looks a little bit different but it was
the shade that I had picked out for the
blush that I wanted so when I thought
was the perk I was like this is just
meant to be it's this is how I knew I
was on the right track and use my Sigma
f40 for this blush the only hard part is
kind of like putting my brush in there
but well okay we'll see how it goes
I like this blush looked very a
fall-like which is part of the reason I
was attracted to it it's kind of like
almost like a deep mom I would say mmm
looks pretty
I thought showing up or really well I
had I mean I thought I was gonna have
some problems
you know dipping my brush into it
because it's the deluxe sample here but
I mean really I feel like I got a lot of
color payoff on my cheeks I actually
might have to go in and just blend him
out just a little bit because thought
showed up very well
okay alright so most of the face is done
back to my eyes the first I'm gonna do
my brows off-camera brows are on so I'm
going to finish off the eyes so I'm
coming back into the yes please palette
I think I'm actually going to mix these
two colors the red and then a deeper
brown in the second row so I'm going to
come in with the morphe 43 and I'm first
going to pick up the red and push this
really close to the lower lash line I'm
gonna come in with the morphe M 507 and
pick up the shade right next to that red
and then just kind of sweep it along the
lower lash line and blend it with the
red I'm gonna grab at the morphe 18 and
this really pretty gold shade in the
second row and I'm going to apply that
to the inner corner it looks pretty
I'm just between this one and the one
that I did apply to the lid over which
one which one I should apply but I like
them both I'm gonna grab the third shade
in the palette it's kind of a pinky
shade I'm gonna grab just a little bit
on the morphe 36 and apply that
underneath the brow bone so that's going
to do it for all the shadows on my eyes
and really thicken the way those fall
look it came out I'm gonna pop on some
lashes off-camera these were also sent
to me from Candice and her little note
is still on here it says number one fave
high-end lashes so that is what we were
going once these are the tardis Pro
lashes and they are in the style center
of attention so I'm going to go ahead
and pop these on here is what they look
like I'm excited
I just tried some tart lashes a couple
days ago I thought it was in one of my
videos yes trying new holiday makeup I
try to a set from Tarte and have a pair
of lashes in there and they actually
weren't my fave but these are different
these are TARDIS pearl lashes the other
ones were not the pro lashes like the
packaging and everything just looks very
different from those so I'm excited to
give these a try so I'm gonna pop these
off off-camera and then we'll finish off
the face and this look using your
favorite makeup
ah alrighty so the lashes actually gave
me some trouble so don't mind if they
look a little on the wonky side they
have such an intense curve to them and I
couldn't get them to flatten out a
little bit so my eyes don't have that
intense curve that the lashes did so it
was a little bit hard to get them on but
I'll just have to kind of play around
with the band a little bit as best as I
can so I feel like they're looking a
little funky but we're just gonna move
on into highlight so I thought it was so
funny when I asked on Twitter for
highlight suggestions I had so many
people recommending this exact same
highlighter the first couple names I
wrote down Melissa
Pisces princess Malo you guys all
suggested the Urban Decay sin
highlighter it's one of the afterglow
eight our powder highlights into the
shade sin and it was crazy because even
more people kept commenting the Urban
Decay spin and I was like okay we're
gonna go with the Urban Decay spin I've
never tried these before here's what the
packaging looks like it's very fancy oh
that's pretty
ok ok so I grabbed out my Sigma fo3
which is my favorite highlighting brush
and let's just go ahead and see I feel
like I have a lot of expectations for
this highlight because I think the only
other one that had like you know
multiple people suggested the same item
was the benefit bowing but it was crazy
to me how many people were suggesting
sin from Urban Decay and that is really
really pretty
Wow and it wasn't even you know the
Urban Decay afterglow highlights it was
sick Urban Decay sin Urban Decay since I
was like this one I just most definitely
have to grab so thank you to everyone
who suggested Urban Decay sin that looks
amazing and that is way way pretty thank
you guys for suggesting this one to me
that's a gorgeous it's almost like wet
on the skin go Urban Decay sin that's
gorgeous a thank you everyone who
suggested this one this was the most
overwhelming voted on product for sure
for this video
hmmm that's really pretty though I had
such a tough time with lip color I asked
on Instagram what lip color you guys
would like me to do and so many of the
comments that came in war products that
I've already tried some of my favorites
I'm like what do i do what do I do and I
was able to pick out some of products
that I already have I just haven't tried
that particular shade but then I saw
this one come in and I had been meeting
to run to the drugstore all week to pick
up one of these and I didn't get the
time to do it but then I got a sample in
one of my Ulta orders and I was like oh
my gosh that was the lipstick I was
gonna buy so I'm going to use the sample
because I couldn't have enough time to
run out to the store this week but these
are the L'Oreal infallible paints so
this is what the little sample card
looks like and I'm really excited
I always ignore my samples so so I'm
like hey this works out really well for
me and a big THANK YOU to Emily from
Instagram she is the one who suggested
this and I've been wanting to try these
so I am gonna try nude star of course
I'm gonna try the nude but nudes are my
favorites and I think that's the one I
want if I would have went to the store
and bought one I was gonna buy it and
spicy blush but I feel like nude star is
really similar to it so let's go ahead I
don't have a lip brush so I'm gonna have
to use my finger and switch I don't like
putting my hands and makeup but that's
okay that's okay this is my punishment
for not getting to the store so there is
what nude star looks like on me it's a
beautiful nude I really like the shades
applying it I thought it felt very
comfortable it doesn't feel sticky at
all
hmmm yeah it's just nice and creamy and
smooth on the lips I really do like that
color so thank you to Emily for
suggesting the L'Oreal lip pains and
then after I have my lipstick on that is
going to do it for this video trying out
