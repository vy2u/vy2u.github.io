today I'm just going to be doing a quick
little review on tantowels I have
mentioned them before I think in a haul
video I mentioned that I bought the
tantowels just to try them out and see
how they were and that I would give them
a little bit more of a whirl and then be
able to do a review for you so this is
just going to be a quick little rundown
of the tantowels how I use them what my
thoughts were if I thought they worked
and if I think you should purchase them
so if you would like to see my thoughts
on the tantowel please click like do you
want to say that i'm trying out a new
lip color you guys can tell me what you
think about it this is Limbo from
colour-pop and it's basically just a
true brown color but I just got a bit
colour-pop haul I'm going to be filming
at that video shortly going over all of
the different lipsticks I got to lippie
stix and four of these ultra matte
liquid lipsticks and then two of their
blushes as well so I'll be doing a full
haul video and review and swatch video
for you but I'm testing out each of the
different products that I've got so I've
been using the liquid lipsticks
throughout the days this one was like my
wild card that I bought and it's pretty
much it's a wild card I mean you guys
can tell me your thoughts on it it's
brown Browns I seem to be very in and
especially with fall coming it's I don't
even know if it's gonna reach sixty
degrees here today in Iowa it is so
chilly outside but I thought it would be
a good fall color to test and try out
for you guys since it's probably like a
bit of a more intimidating color to buy
so that's kind of what I had in mind
when I purchased it but this is what it
looks like
that's limbo from colour-pop get into
the actual purpose of this video I'm
going to be talking about the tan towels
in this like cute little orange and
white packaging box the ones that I got
it says it's for half body application
for face and body okay I thought I was
reading that wrong you can get the
tantowels they have them for face and
body they have ones that are just for
face and the box that I picked up it
does say tan towel plus on here and the
plus is supposed to mean it's for like a
darker application and I think they had
tantowel classic as well when I was
buying these and
about the Plus mostly just because when
I do self-tan like I want to sell tea
and I want to I want to get at it I
don't just want to be like kind of tan
this box had ten towelettes in it and it
was $27
I bought him from topalov boutique it is
the boutique that my sister-in-law owns
I mentioned her in a recent clothing
haul that I did but she sells the
tantowels so you can buy them at a lot
of different locations but you know I
believe amazon has them
tantowels of course has their own
website and i believe it was like on HSN
or QVC or one of those like home
shopping channels that my aunt was
telling me that she purchased them on it
and it was like for some crazy super
awesome discounted price so if you watch
any of those channels their shop through
them I would be on the lookout for
tantowels because i parently they offer
really good deals on there so I mean
price-wise it's probably gonna vary
quite a bit for exactly what you're
looking for how many you want tant the
tantowel website does have more like
they had spraying mist and they had like
regular lotion they have huge packs they
have like packs that just have a ton of
towelettes in them I mean the website is
really good I thought and they have a
lot of different options on there for
you but sometimes you can find them for
cheaper at places like boutiques there
are other online vendors or even the
home shopping networks so that's kind of
a breakdown of the price and I thought
so for ten towelettes they say they're
for half body application for your face
in your body so what I did is I used one
towel and I basically tanned my lower
body i canned like my legs and like my
stomach sort of thing and then I used
another towel and I tanned like my chest
my upper torso my back my arms and my
face so it took me to towels to tan my
entire body and usually when I go in to
self tan at an actual tanning bed and
use like that versus spa is usually the
one that I use the most for my tan at
places it's like thirty dollars every
single time that I go into tan because I
don't do memberships because I don't tan
that often to feel like I need a
membership so just to do it like that
a la carte I believe it's around thirty
dollars for one and I've
27 for 10 towelettes which cut it in
half gives me 5 times so basically I'm
saving money already so that makes me
very happy
so that's kind of the gist on my
breakdown of the money if you're someone
who spends money to go get spray tans
and things like that
this could be a cheaper option for you
now when it comes to the actual
application of it I was my first thought
was to actually do it for you on camera
but honestly I just was in Chicago last
weekend for three days and the Friday
that we were there we went to a Chicago
Cubs and White Sox game and it was like
90 degrees at 3 o'clock at game time we
were sitting in the Sun we were in the
bleachers and I am actually pretty tan
right now so I didn't think the tan
towels would actually do anything for me
so I'm not actually going to put it on
for you on camera but it takes a couple
hours to develop anyways so it's not
like you would have seen anything if I
applied it on camera just come in a
little package like this and then on the
inside it kind of reminds me of just
like a moist towelette a wet palate
sorry if you are someone who doesn't
like the word moist I do is just take it
and you rub it in circular motions over
your body so that's really all you do
you just rub it in the circular motions
make sure you get everywhere that you
want to tan you know if you have trouble
you know maybe reaching your back if you
have a friend or spouse or someone on
hand that can help you out with that
that's probably good who recommend
having some sort of towel on the hand
that you're doing it with because the
first time I did it I just did it with
my bare hand I'm right-handed I just
used my right hand to do everything and
my right hand was stained pretty orange
so I would recommend going in with a
towel it wasn't super bad like felt like
I couldn't leave my house I look so
silly I needed to hurt Michael Jackson
glove but it was somewhat noticeable so
the next time that I used it I just wore
my husband does a lot of work in the
basement and he wears like he's like
plastic gloves to protect his hands I
just used one of those applied it and
everything was fine it went much better
so that's kind of an apple
tip that I found for you but after you
get done putting it on wherever it is
that you want to put it on it does say
that it will take two to four hours to
produce the tan and in that two to four
hours you want to avoid things like
showering and probably working out or
anything where you're gonna sweat a lot
I kind of want to avoid anything that
will get you wet because that could
cause problems with like streaking and
things like that
I will remember one time it was in
college I went and I had gotten a spray
tan and I went home and watched an
episode of Gilmore Girls then you want
to watch Gilmore Girls but I cried and I
didn't really like one tear started to
go down my cheek and I was like oh no no
I spray tan and I tried to wipe him away
but you could see the tear track in my
face and I was like cool what how how do
I fix this I mean I look like a clown it
was ridiculous so don't do anything
that's gonna cause you to sweat or
anything like that wait the two to four
hours and then I just take a shower and
wash it off what I found was kind of
interesting as I put it on you won't see
anything right away it's not like you
wipe it on you're like oh look Brown you
don't see anything right away but over
time it does start to develop that spray
tan smell like whenever I would get back
from getting a spray tan at the tanning
salon like you could smell it and some
people some of my friends I know
wouldn't shower after getting a spray
tan like they would even want to sleep
in it because it's kind of like the
longer you can keep it on the more you
like the deeper tan you get type of
thing and I know people that actually
sleep in it and like there is no way I'd
be able to do that because you just kind
of start to smell and it's not like you
smell like Bo or like garbage it just
has a very particular spray tan smell so
when I put it on the first time and
realized I was starting to smell like
that I'm like well this is like an
actual spray tan that I put on my body
like how cool is that
so that's another thing I noticed but I
wait at the full four hours and then I
took a shower and you will notice when
you shower like your water is kind of
brown and I know you know one of the
first times that I ever spray tan - and
I showered and it was brown I was like I
just washed off my entire
right and like why did I do that but
what it's doing is just like taking like
the excess off so you're not sticking
anymore you don't have any like residual
residue on your body or anything like
that
but you still will be tan so don't panic
if you see the brown water and think you
washed up your spray tan because you
still will be tan and then really after
the four hours you take a shower you
come out and you are tan my tan from the
tantowels lasted just about two weeks I
mean it does fade over time and it
probably fades more if you shower more I
have mentioned this in some of my past
videos that I work from home and don't
really go anywhere so I only wash my
hair like twice a week but I do like
body showers probably three or four
times depending on like the workouts
that I'm doing and things like that if I
get really sweaty I need to rinse my
body off type of thing but my spray tan
lasted about two weeks which I was
really happy with as for the actual
color I did like the color of it it did
make me look tan but it did have kind of
an orange tint to it and I would say
especially like the first like days one
and day two I noticed that it was more
orange and then over time that orange
kind of seemed to fade so the first two
days or so I would say that I noticed an
orange tint to it
but I will also say in certain spray
tanning beds
I noticed Orange as well so I mean I
don't know it didn't bother me that much
just because I've seen it happen before
in spray tanning bed and it faded after
the two days and I thought it just
looked tan and like a regular tan so I
wasn't too upset with it but some of you
may notice that it can turn kind of
orange so that was what I noticed with
the color and then for application tips
I mean I don't know if I have a whole
lot of application tips like I talked
about using the glove for the hand that
you want to tan I do recommend like
starting with the larger areas of your
body so if you're gonna do your full
body I say to start with the legs just
because you know legs take longer to tan
and you want to give
you want to give the areas of your body
that you have the most of the most time
to tan as well I don't think that's a
huge deal I don't think that's
necessarily how you have to start but
when I do watch a lot of other
self-tanning videos most people tend to
start with their legs and kind of worked
your way up did tan my face the very
first time I used it just because I
wanted to be able to use it on all areas
of my body so I could talk to you guys
about it so I did Tan my face the first
time and I didn't the next time just
because I truly don't feel like my face
and needs to be tan it's probably the
one area my body gets that gets tan the
quickest naturally just when I'm outside
so and it's also the part of my body
that I'm constantly washing you know I
wash my face twice a day I'm exfoliating
my face I just felt like I was going to
be immediately taking the tan off I also
did think my face turned pretty orange
and it didn't fade as easily as the rest
of my body so I thought my face stayed
kind of more orange Rius and the reasons
why I avoided doing my face I know they
do have the face towels that are
specifically for your face I do not have
those so I don't know are they different
are they only smaller towelettes from
the regular half body towelettes I'm not
totally positive but they do have ones
that are specific for your face you know
maybe they have different ingredients
for it for you know there's things like
acne I'm really not sure on that but I
probably would not tan my face again
what these tan towels are really even
with any other self-tanner just because
I don't feel like my face needs it
sometimes when you spray tan they do
recommend to put lotion in areas that
you don't want tamp like between the
webs of your fingers places that like
look awkward and that don't necessarily
get tan like the webs of your fingers
I've talked about I usually put the
lotions I like on the sides of my feet
and on my heels places that you kind of
want to avoid the tan I didn't see that
I needed to do that with the tan towel
so I didn't use lotion the first time
anywhere and I thought everything turned
out fine I didn't use lotion the second
time either and I thought everything
turned out fine so that's something a
little bit different from a spray tan
and a salon that I noticed
I didn't necessarily need when I get a
spray tan in the tanning salon
I'm always use that lotion i I have to
have that that was for application tips
i I didn't have too many I would
recommend putting down some sort of
towel when you are self-tanning snow
sometimes if it does transfer onto your
feet then you're not getting it on your
bathroom floor things like that so the
second time that I stopped and I just
stood on a towel and did it and
everything worked out fine for me I also
wear loose clothing afterwards and you
know I'm just kind of like bigger
t-shirts not shirts that I would be
bummed about if any product did transfer
to it but I did not notice a lot of
transfer onto my clothes after I used
the tan towel I would say I probably
noticed him more when I use an actual
spray tan machine so I didn't think that
was a big issue though all in all for
the money and for the convenience and
for the overall effect I really had a
good experience with the tan towels it
wasn't anything that I was like super
blown away by I mean that I'm like you
can't live without this product because
I mean panning is kind of like a ticket
or leave it especially if you live
somewhere in a more sunshiny climate and
you can be out in the Sun a lot you know
maybe you don't need to worry about self
tanning but for me for someone who you
know a lot of times just for special
events I would like to be tanner these
came in really really handy for me I
used him before I was a bridesmaid at a
wedding and I thought it gave me a
really good color payoff and I like to
get out of my bridesmaid dress which was
awesome but it helps save me money on
going to the tanning salon and it's also
such a huge convenience factor I don't
have to worry about going anywhere I can
do it in the comfort of my own home
which i think is a really big deal I
don't have to worry about lines you know
sometimes at our tanning salon
especially because we all know how
dangerous tanning beds are the sunless
tanning has become so popular I've had
to wait a half hour at a time before to
get into our vs. spot or tanning salon
you know this is just hey I have a free
moment I'm just gonna go quickly tan
myself wait a couple hours and then
shower it off in the afternoon and boom
I'm tan so I mean for the price the
convenience and
I think the color does look good it
worked out really well for me so would I
recommend this product I would I think
it worked out really well I'm really
happy that I got to try it out I'm happy
that I was shopping at topple off one
day and noticed the tantowels and was
like I should give these a shot because
they really have come in handy
especially now that we're getting more
into like the fall I don't know if I
will self tan a lot in the winter just
because it does kind of look out of your
tan and it's 20 below with six feet of
snow outside am I going to have a tan me
oh my god
but in the fall when you just don't want
to let go a summer it'll probably be a
nice thing to have around the house that
is my review of the tan towels I hope
you enjoyed it I hope you learned
something maybe if you were on the fence
about purchasing the tan towels or
another self-tanning item I hope this
helped and gave you some information if
you guys do have any other questions
that maybe I didn't address or I miss or
I probably I'm sure I forgot something I
meant to write this down but I never
write anything down for videos and I was
like nope let's just go with it and see
what pops up but if I miss anything or
Eve any other questions please just
comment below and then we'll be so happy

to say leave your experience below as
well you know maybe help someone else

purchasing a few other sunless tanning
items just to be able to talk to you
about them and give you like more
options so if there's anything that you
guys have had your eye on that you're
thinking about please let me know what
it is and hopefully I can purchase out
in the future and try it out for you so
