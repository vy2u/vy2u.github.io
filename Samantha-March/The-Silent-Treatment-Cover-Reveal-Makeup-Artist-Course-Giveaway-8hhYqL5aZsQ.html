doing this video this is the silent
treatment by melanie Serani and i love
the cover the woman on the cover kinda

i'll go ahead and read it to you so you
know what the book is about but it is 28
year old katrina is rebuilding her life
after escaping an abusive boyfriend the
last thing she needs is the mystery she
stumbles on during a bout of retail
therapy but she can't ignore the coil of
film a piece of movie history she finds
hidden inside her purchase unfortunately
Peter the handsome host of the estate's
Dale disappears before cat has a chance
to return it to him curious cat watches
the strip and a shock to witness the
brutal murder of a famous 1920s
film star by a fellow actor when a news
article cites cat as the film's honor
her already complicated life goes from
bad to worse someone begins stalking her
are they trying to silence her or what
has she discovered this book the silent

review below as well so you can read my
thoughts on it I did give it a 4 star
review I really enjoy mystery books i
know i feel like i say that in so many
of my videos but i enjoy a good mystery
and i also love love love the 1920s i
just recently i think i talked about it
in a video went to a bachelor party that
was 1920's themed and dressed up as a
flapper and it was so much fun and so i
absolutely love that this novel tied in
that aspect as well it's really really
good cat has a very intense backstory
happening with her family with an
abusive boyfriend and then we have this
whole mystery thrown in there and the
silent films and it's it's really really
good it was a lot of fun to read so
please do go ahead check it out on
Goodreads add it to your shelf read my
review see if it's something that you
think that you would be interested and
enjoy again you can pre-order it on
amazon and it would be delivered to your
kindle on august 10th or else august
10th is the date that it goes on sale
but the cover reveal was this week so i
absolutely love the new cover of this
the old cover will probably still be on
Chiclets plus but i will be updating
that cover so I depending on when you go
to it you only look at all cover the new
cover but I love the new cover again
just because it like brings you that
1920s field I think it looks absolutely
beautiful I love it that is the silent
treatment that is the book that is
bringing us this entire video and now
I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about the makeup look I'm
wearing and the contest that I will be
enduring okay so a little bit about the
look I'm wearing in a really fun contest
that I wanted to let you guys know about
so Melanie and her book marketing
manager teamed up was trendy me and I
really hope I'm saying that right they
are having a summer style contest anyone
can enter and it doesn't have to just be
a makeup look I mean you can you can
enter a makeup lug you can enter it like
nail design I think on their website
they even talked about like if you have
a cool like living room design decor you
can submit kind of anything that has to
do with style things like hairstyles you
know things like that but I'm going to
be entering this makeup look because
what I actually use on my eyes ties in
with the silent treatment because this
is a very cute little palette from wet
and wild and it is actually called
silent treatment so the name of the
palette ties in with the book that we
were talking about so I thought that was
really fun and it is the look that I
used on my eyes it's also really nice
because the palette has down which
colors to use so this like light pink
shade is for your brow bone the darker
color is for your crease and then this
like you don't even know what I call it
kind of like this tapesh shade is for
your eyelid so that is exactly what I
did the crease first with this darker
shade and just used a fluffy friend a
blending brush from BH Cosmetics and i
buffed it all into my crease and then I
went in with an eyelid with just like a
regular flat eyeshadow brush and put it
all over my eyelid and then i blended
those together and then I took a smaller
brush for my brow bone put it in my brow
bone all the way up to my eyebrow and
then I also popped just a little bit on
the corner of my eye lid so I can swatch
each of these colors for you so you can
see them so these are the three colors
that I used the light pink one is the
brow bone the middle one is the crease
shade and the end one is
eyelid which I used all over my eyes so
those are the three colors I think all
three are really really beautiful I
especially really do love this light
pink one and I could see me using that
all over my lid as well and then just
putting maybe like the crease shade I
could see that one too I also love that
eyelid color till has like a shimmer to
it so I just thought it turned out
really really beautiful so those are the
three colors that i used i did a regular
winged liner with my maybelline gel
eyeliner i also put the crease shade
underneath my lower lash line and i also
have my NYX gel eyeliner pencil on my
waterline and I smudge those out with
the middle shade with the crease shade
and then I just have heart lights camera
lashes mascara on so that is the look
that I did for my eyes it was super
quick super simple one pallet very easy
look and I absolutely loved that we
could find an eyeshadow palette called
silent treatment like I just I was like
whoa what are the chances of that how
amazing it is from wet'n'wild so it's
really affordable i think it was like
two dollars and i think they were
available at like CVS you know wherever
what wildest old CVS Walgreens dollar
general things like that so very
accessible palette as well and very
inexpensive if you want to recreate this
look if anyone what does want to see a
makeup tutorial on how i did it you know
i just kind of went through the basic
steps but if you do want to see a
tutorial just let me know and i'm sure i
can try really hard to put that together

very cool you will get your certificate

pro card once you are certified I know
Mac Pro cars are a really big deal I
think you get like 40 percent off of Mac
products I might be saying that
incorrectly because obviously I don't
have a micro card I am NOT a certified
makeup artist I just do this for fun but
I know a lot of people really do like
that mac pro card because of the big
discount that you can get so once you
complete and pass and get your
certification you can apply for your mac
pro card so one winner who is watching
