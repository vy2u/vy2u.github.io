so I am very excited for today's video
because it is all about the two-faced
sweet peach palette so this baby as I'm
sure many of you know was super hard to
get my hands on and if you were part of
my snapchat family you'll know that I
tried the first couple times to get it
online and it did not work out and I
just I just said forget about it I said
it shouldn't be this hard to get a
palette and I don't want to keep working
hard and like I was waking up in the
middle of the night to see if it was
like going on sale at the time said I
said it was and I was like nope I'm done
with it I'm over it then Instagram
happens if you are not familiar if
you're new to my channel of my Instagram
my snapchat fam my Instagram got
disabled on March 30th and my entire
account was disabled for exactly one
week and it appeared that several
several several several accounts also
got disabled during this time and no one
really knew why no one at Instagram was
saying anything it was basically just
being said from like people who are
speculating that it was when Instagram
was doing all of these updates and it
changes and lots of problems were
happening so we didn't know if it was
just like a glitch that caused it virus
a bug if they were truly disabled if
they were gone like no one had any idea
and it was pretty devastating I waited a
couple days to see if it would come back
and by the third day when it still
hadn't come back I was like well I need
to start over and I made a new Instagram
account and started over and my very
first post you know I just kind of
explained what was going on said who I
was and it was just it was really hard
it was hard for me to even remember who
I was following like I was like I can't
remember the usernames and I was trying
so hard for so many hours a day to find
all of my friends again like it was
crazy it was it was hard but I got so
much love and support and positivity and
messages coming in and people saying
like hold on you know maybe I'll get
your
back I'm thinking of you I'm hoping you
get your account back you know etc etc
and it was hard to lose Instagram
because I've had it for almost exactly a
year and I've put a lot of work and time
and energy into it and it meant all of
my pictures were gone because it wasn't
just that my Instagram wasn't there
anymore it would have been completely
gone no one could even find that all
those pictures were gone some patterns
that I worked really hard on you know I
bought this new camera specifically for
Instagram to take photos with and just
everything was gone and it was pretty
upsetting time but truly and I kept
saying to people on snap it on Instagram
and other social medias like thank you
guys for your positivity for keeping me
positive and for keeping me motivated
and then exactly one week later it was
Wednesday morning I woke up to so many
messages text messages Facebook messages
snapchat messages
Instagram comments that my Instagram was
back and it was like oh my gosh we still
don't really know what happened but I
noticed that everyone else was starting
to get their Instagram accounts back so
I don't really know what happened but
I'm just glad that I'm back and I was
like you know what I'm gonna try even
harder to get that palette because I
want to get a second one and I want to
do a giveaway and I did a giveaway it's
already closed and it's over with I did
it on my Instagram specifically like for
my Instagram peeps because I was just so
happy to get it back but then I was like
you know what I'm gonna pick one up for
myself this is what I really really
wanted to get myself for my birthday and
I wasn't able to get it so I got it as
the celebration of having my Instagram
back so that is a really long intro and
I'm sorry but I just had to tell my
story because it was crazy that I was
like you know what forget about it I'll
order other things and I did if you saw
my birthday haul I didn't shirk myself
on my birthday or anything like that but
this was what I really really wanted and
I was really upset when I realized how
hard it was going to be to get and I was
really bummed out but I tried to move
past it then when everything happened it
just kind of like put me into a tailspin
so I decided to get for myself but she
said give one for you guys really happy
I was able to give one away on my
Instagram as well do stay tuned I am
closing in on 2,000 subscribers here on
YouTube and I do
I'm doing a very big giveaway for that I
also do plan on doing a 5,000 follower
on Instagram which is what I originally
was going to do before I lost everything
but now I got it back and now we're back
on track I'm going to do something big
for 5,000 followers this was just like a
little flash giveaway to say thank you
not back hello
but so I need to stop talking because we
have plenty to cover in this video I'm
gonna do a little review my feedback on
the palette if I think you guys need it
if I think you guys should get it I'm
gonna do swatches of all of the shades
in here and I'm also gonna do a little
demo just on one eye just a quick little
demo of me putting a couple different
shadows on and coming up with this a
look that I created I also do have a
mini tutorial on Instagram of a couple
of the shadows that I put on as well and
I can leave that video link in my
description box below but yes
sorry I think this is my longest intro
that I've done in a really long time but
if you would like to see a demo of the
two-faced sweet peach pellet and my
reviews I wanted to do something a
little bit different than what I've done
on my channel and I feel like I kind of
do the same like technique makeup look a
lot and recently I've been trying to get
past that and be more creative with my
looks even though I'm not like any sort
of trained to makeup artist and I'm
really I I don't feel like I'm
artistically creative and I say that
because when I say I'm not creative
people will say well you're an author it
not takes a lot of creativity but
artistically I don't feel like I'm very
creative so I get challenged a lot when
it does come to makeup and I think
that's why it took me so long to finally
take the plunge because Mesa makeup is
basically art like your your face is
your canvas and I think that's why
makeup scared me for so long and one
thing that I've been trying to do
recently is a halo eye and that's
actually what I tried to do over here
but I am not feeling like my halo eyes
are coming out very halo II because it's
like when I do the inner corner I feel
like the two outer shades like I feel
like they're just all blending together
and they're not that like nice halo eye
look that I see
other people getting but I'm gonna keep
trying I'm gonna keep doing it but I
wanted to kind of push myself and do
something different so that's what I
decided to do today and even though I
don't think it came out 100% I still
wanted to do the other eye on camera and
show you guys the different colors
because really this video is not a
makeup tutorial it's me showing you
different colors in this palette and how
they apply and all that good stuff so
that's kind of why I wasn't like as
worried about it but I didn't think any
that I did think something was 100% but
it's also a real life not everything's
always going to be 100% so to get
started the first color that I came in
with was candied peach which is this
pink shade right here and it's got a
little bit of sparkle to it as well and
I just put that on my morphe M 4-3-3
brush it's just a nice blending brush
from morphe so I just dipped my brush in
there and then went right in with it I
have placed this on the outer V of my
eye and kind of blended it out
and then I also put some right on the
inner part of my eye and put the inner
part I just kind of like tapped it there
to try to get it to not move too much
towards the middle part of my eye and
then for the inner part of my eye is
luscious which is a right here and it's
a beautiful when i swatched all these
colors I was like I have to use this one
because it's gorgeous
I'm just gonna use a flat shader brush
from BH Cosmetics looks like that and
I'm just going to put this into the
middle part of my eye so what I see with
halo is you're supposed to have you know
a color in the middle and then the other
colors making a halo around it type of
effect but I'm not we'll see if this I
goes any easier than the other eye so
then I just keep coming back in with
candied peach and building up the outer
in the inner and then I'll come in with
luscious and then I just keep going
until I feel like till I feel like I got
something going you know you know what
I'm saying
and then to blend everything together
I'm going to use the morphe m4 for one
brush it's just another blending brush
and I'm just gonna kind of blend
everything together so there isn't any
harsh lines especially here on the outer
part of my eye and this isn't even the
part that because when I thought about
it I was kind of maybe I shouldn't be
blending but I see other people blending
so I'm like okay but this isn't the part
that I feel like I lose the halo effect
it's simply adding in all of those
colors I feel like it kind of gets lost
but that's okay I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna keep trying so I think I got it to
where I wanted I think maybe I actually
came out just a little bit better than
the other eye but I'm gonna pop off
camera and do liner and lashes and then
come back to dip into the palette a
little bit more okay so the liner and
lashes are on I'm gonna put some up the
Maybelline master precise skinny pencil
this is in brown I'm gonna put that on
my waterline and just so lightly smudge
it onto the lower lash line as well at
my morphe 36 brush and I'm gonna come in
with the shade just peachy up here this
really pretty pink shade and I'm just
gonna put that on the lower lash line
more towards the outer part of my eye
and the reason why I smudged a little
bit of the brow shadow from Maybelline
onto the lower lash is because sometimes
when me in particular use pink on the
lower lash line it can kind of look like
you like sick so that's why I put a
little bit of brown there and then I
wasn't going to do this because in the
first look that I tried out with this
palette and I put a little mini tutorial
on Instagram I put bless her heart on my
bottom lash line and so I wanted to do
something different but then I just like
wasn't feeling just peachy all the way
so I decided to come in with bless her
heart is
this gorgeous green shade right here and
I'm gonna put that on the lower lash
line as well as using the same brush and
more towards the inner part of my eye
still kind of like merging the colors
together but just that bless her heart
is going to be a little bit more towards
the inner part
I'm telling you guys when I saw this
palette and I saw bless her heart
that was what what like really made me
excited like I was like I have to have
this color I have like deeper dark
greens in my collection but I don't have
anything like this beautiful light green
and I just think it's gorgeous I want to
try to you do something on the lid and
that's what I was gonna try to do today
like maybe pink on the outside green on
the inside or something along those
lines and then I was like no just leave
it alone completely and then that didn't
happen and then for the final step I'm
going to use the morphe eighteen brush
it looks like this and I'm just gonna
grab a little bit of nectar which is
right here
and I'm gonna pop that on to the inner
corner as an inner corner highlight this
shade as an inner corner highlight is
absolutely bomb like can you see that
it's insanely insanely gorgeous this is
what I used in my other tutorial too so
I was like a little maybe I could do
something different with the inner
corner but I'm like no it's just it's
too pretty it calls to be an inner
corner highlight like that was nectar
sculling I mean I think it would look
really pretty on the lid as well and
I've seen a lot of people use it on the
lid but the inner corner is just
beautiful alright so that is just a
quick little demo of the eyes I'm gonna
go put some lipstick on now so I stop
feeling so bare and then you enjoyed
that little demo here with the shadows
and now I wanted to jump in to my review
so first of all this is what the palette
looks like like a hard plastic and then
when you open it up it is magnetic easy
to open and close it's just magnetic
shut when you open it there
is a mere right here but I don't want to
blind you with it and then this is what
the inside of the palette looks like so
I mean obviously it's set up very nice
where it goes from like our lighter
colors and transition shades over into
the shimmery shades and then the last
row is the darker colors so I mean you
have a great variety you have math you
have shimmers you have the lights you
have all the way darks you have like
really fun pops of colors in here
the Pink's are very cool I don't have a
lot of pink in my eyeshadow collection
because I'm not big on putting pink
there but I saw Amanda and sang she had
like a pink look in her snapchat the
other day and I kept watching our snaps
over and over so I was like wait a
second that is really pretty so that was
kind of my inspiration because I've been
wanting to do a pink look but I just
truly don't have any pink shadows and so
when I got this and I was trying to
think of what to do for today I was like
I kind of want to lean towards that pink
look me as I just thought it looked so
pretty so very very pretty shades my
favorites nectar for the inner corner is
just absolutely gorgeous
bless her heart which is the green I'm
obsessed with that color I think it is
so beautiful luscious is what I use
today and it is so pigmented and bright
and it's so beautiful on the lids I'm
very excited to try some of these darker
colors especially like delectable or top
Derby to me I have to figure out how I
would be able to use them and see if I
can like get my creative juices flowing
when I use them but summer yum and puree
I have used as well and they are
gorgeous peaches and cream I thought was
a really good one as like a matte lid
that's what I did in my first tutorial
and white peach is really pretty for
like a brow bone highlight that's what
I've been using a lot overall I can see
myself reaching for this palette so much
not only in the spring or summer time
but there's also these darker colors in
here as well that will be really good
for fall and winter
but we don't really want to think about
fall and winter because I'm ready for
spring to actually get here so let's
just let's just not think about that for
right now this will be a great palette
for spring and summer and you have so
many different varieties there's so many
different things that you could do so
many do
lux you could do with this pallet from
an odd mad guy from shimmer eyes to
colors to neutrals there's just a lot
that you can do in here I was very
impressed so far with every shade that I
have used I've been very impressed with
the pigmentation out of every single
color that I have used so far which I've
use one two three four five six seven
eight nine I've use note 10 I've used
ten of the shades so far and I have
loved all of them and that to me is
saying a lot there's I mean there still
are obviously some that I haven't tried
some maybe there will be that dud in
there and I actually haven't swatched
everything so when I give until the
swatches next we can see if maybe
there's like that one that you know
maybe doesn't work out there's always
got to be that one like there's always
that one in a palette that you're like
nope but so far from the ones that I've
used I have not found it yet and I'm
just I'm really really happy that I got
my hands on this I know that it's being
a little bit difficult to find it but
honestly I'm seeing it pop up more and
in more places and more people are
getting it so hopefully two-face will
understand that people really do want
this palette and for a good reason
beautiful shades in here very pigmented
lots of different looks that you can do
and of course it smells like peaches
I actually don't own any of the
chocolate palettes from Too Faced I am
NOT a huge huge eye shadow palette girl
just because like I was saying there's
always those shades that you don't use
in your palette and I like to order from
like makeup geek or I recently ordered
from Anastasio where you can order the
singles put them in a Z palette you can
have your own custom palette made of the
shades that you know that you're gonna
use but since getting on YouTube and
being a beauty vlogger now and wanting
to do more looks and be able to show you
guys more things I'm slowly getting into
the world of the eyeshadow palettes but
none of the chocolate palettes really
really spoke to me but for some reason
when I saw this peach palette come out
there I was like I need this and I'm
really happy that I changed my mind and
decided to pick up the palette decided
to go to alta at 10 a.m. on a Thursday
morning when they
and pick up one of these pallets if you
guys can get your hands on it I
definitely would recommend it when I've
been seeing it come available
I've left my snapchat BAM nope also
trend mood one on Instagram is a really
good account to follow they do a lot of
updates on there when makeup comes out
and I think they've done every single
times the peach palette has come
available somewhere they have news about
it but again this palette is just I mean
it's just it's so pretty it smells good
there's so many different looks you can
do with it I'm happy I bought it I feel
like you're gonna see this in a
favorites video real soon and if you can
like I said I would definitely
and that is everything for this video
hope you find it helpful and enjoyed my
little demo the swatches my little
review on it I feel like I just kept
repeating myself in my review but the
times that I have used this palette I
have just been so impressed with I'm so
happy with it I really hope that you
guys can get your hands on it if you can
if you are able to I definitely suggest
you pick this up I don't feel like you
will be disappointed
very good palette very impressed with
your face for putting this together and
okay I just wanted to smell or more time
I never knew that I'd be a fan of like a
peaches smell but this ballot it's so
funny because I opened it up to start to
do my makeup and then the smell gets up
to me and it just like puts me in a
better mood like I don't know something
about the peach smell it just like makes
me happy it probably because it like
makes me think of spring and I'm like
crossing my fingers for warm weather
it's gonna come sometime I just know it
but I do hope you guys did enjoy this
video if there's any other looks that
you would like to see me do with this
palette please just comment below let me
know if there's any sort of shades that
you want to see used in a makeup
tutorial please just comment below let
me know and I would be so happy to do
another tutorial using this palette and
