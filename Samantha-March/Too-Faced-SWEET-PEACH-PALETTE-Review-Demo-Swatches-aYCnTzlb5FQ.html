Oh
everyone and welcome back to my channel
so i am very excited for today's video
because it is all about the today's
sweet peach palate so this baby as i'm
sure many of you know was super hard to
get my hands on and if you were proud of
my snapchat family you'll know that I
tried the first couple times to get it
online and it did not work out and I
just I just said forget about it I said
it shouldn't be this hard to get a
pallid and I don't want to keep working
hard and like I was waking up in the
middle of the night to see if it was
like going on sale the time said I said
it was and I was like nope I'm done with
it I'm over it then instagram happens if
you are not familiar if you're new to my
channel my instagram i snapchat fam my
instagram got disabled on march 30th and
my entire account was disabled for
exactly one week and it appeared that
several several several several accounts
also got disabled during this time and
no one really knew why no one at
instagram was saying anything it was
basically just being said from like
people who are speculating that it was
when Instagram was doing all of these
updates and it changes and lots of
problems were happening so we didn't
know if it was just like a glitch that
caused it virus a bug if they were truly
disabled if they were gone like no one
had any idea and it was pretty
devastating I waited a couple days to
see if it would come back and by the
third day when it still hadn't come back
I was like well I need to start over and
i made a new Instagram account and
started over and my very first Palestine
I just kind of explained what was going
on said who I was and it was just it was
really hard it was hard for me to even
remember who I was following like I was
like I can't remember the usernames and
I was trying so hard for so many hours a
day to find all of my friends again like
it was crazy it was it was hard but I
got so much love and support and
positivity and messages coming in and
people saying like hold on you know
maybe I'll get your
back i'm thinking of you i'm hoping you
get your account back you know etc etc
and it was hard to lose instagram
because i've had it for almost exactly a
year and I put a lot of work and time
and energy into it and it meant all of
my pictures were gone because it wasn't
just that my Instagram wasn't there
anymore it had been completely gone no
one could even find that all those
pictures were gone some pictures that I
worked really hard on you know I bought
this new camera specifically for
Instagram to take photos with and just
everything was gone and it was pretty
upsetting time but truly and I kept
saying to people on snap it on Instagram
and other social medias like thank you
guys for your positivity for keeping me
positive and for keeping me motivated
and then exactly one week later it was
wednesday morning i woke up to so many
messages text messages facebook messages
snapchat messages Instagram comments
that my instagram was back and it was
like oh my gosh we still don't really
know what happened but i noticed that
everyone else was starting to get their
Instagram accounts back so I don't
really know what happened but I'm just
glad that I'm back and I was like you
know what I'm gonna try even harder to
get that palette because I want to get a
second one I want to do a giveaway and i
did a giveaway it's already closed and
it's over with I did it on my Instagram
specifically like for my Instagram peeps
because I was just so happy to get it
back but then I was like you know what
I'm gonna pick one up for myself this is
what I really really wanted to get
myself for my birthday and I wasn't able
to get it so I got it as the celebration
having my Instagram back so that is a
really long intro and I'm sorry but I
just had to tell my story because it was
crazy that I was like you know what
forget about it I'll order other things
and I did if you saw my birthday haul I
didn't shirk myself on my birthday or
anything like that but this was what I
really really wanted and I was really
upset when I realized how hard it was
going to be to get and I was really
bummed out but I tried to move past it
and when everything happened it just
kind of like put me into a tailspin so I
decided to get from myself which says
give one for you guys really happy I was
able to give one away on my Instagram as
well do stay tuned I am closing in on
two thousand subscribers here on YouTube
and I do play
and doing a very big giveaway for that I
also do plan on doing a 5,000 follower
on instagram which is what I originally
was going to do before I lost everything
but now I got it back and now we're back
on track we're going to do something big
for 5,000 followers this was just like a
little flash giveaway to say thank you
not back hello but so I need to stop
talking because we have plenty to cover
in this video I'm going to do a little
review my feedback on the palate if I
think you guys need it I think you guys
should get it I'm going to do swatches
of all of the shades in here and i'm
also going to do a little demo just on
one I just a quick little demo of me
putting a couple different shadows on
and coming up with this a look that I
created I also do have a mini tutorial
on Instagram of the couple of the
shadows that I put on as well and I can
leave that video link in my description
box below but yes sorry I think this is
my longest intro that I've done in a
really long time but if you would like
to see a demo of the two-faced sweet
peach pellet and my reviews I wanted to
do something a little bit different than
what I've done on my channel and I feel
like I kind of do the same like
technique makeup look a lot and recently
I've been trying to get past that and be
more creative with my looks even though
i've got like any sort of train to make
up artist and I'm really I don't feel
like I'm artistically creative and I say
that because when i say i'm not creative
people will say well you're an author
not takes a lot of creativity but
artistically I don't feel like I'm very
creative so I get challenged a lot when
it does come to make up and I think
that's why it took me so long to finally
take the plunge because Mesa makeup is
basically art like your your face is
your canvas and I think that's why
makeup scared me for so long and one
thing that I've been trying to do
recently is a halo I and that's actually
what I tried to do over here but i am
not feeling like my halo eyes are coming
out very halo II because it's like when
I do the inner corner I feel like the
two outer shades like I feel like
they're just all blending together and
they're not that like nice halo I look
that I see other people getting butt
keep trying I'm gonna keep doing it but
I wanted to kind of push myself and do
something different so that's what I
decided to do today and even though I
don't think it came out one hundred
percent I still wanted to do the other
eye on camera and show you guys the
different colors because really this
video is not a makeup tutorial it's me
showing you different colors in this
palette and how they apply and all that
good stuff so that's kind of why I
wasn't like as worried about it but I
didn't think any that I didn't think
something was 100% but it's also a real
life not everything's always going to be
one hundred percent so to get started
the first color that I came in with was
candied peach which is this pink shade
right here and it's got a little bit of
sparkle to it as well and I just put
that on my morphe m4 33 brush it's just
a nice blending brush from morphe so i
just dipped my brush in there and then
went right in with it I have placed this
on the outer V of my eye and kind of
blended it out
and then I also put some right on the
inner part of my eye and put the inner
part i just kind of like tapped it there
to try to get it to not move too much
towards the middle part of my eye and
then for the inner part of my eyes
luscious which is a right here and it's
a beautiful what i swatched all these
colors I was like I have to use this one
because it's gorgeous I'm just going to
use a flat shader brush from bhcosmetics
looks like that and i'm just going to
put this into the metal part of my eye
so what I see with halo eyes you're
supposed to have you know a color in the
middle and then the other colors making
a halo around it type of effect but I
don't know we'll see if this goes any
easier than the other eye so then I just
keep coming back in with candy peach and
building up the outer in the inner and
then I'll come in with luscious and then
I just keep going until I feel like till
I feel like I got something going you
know you know what I'm saying
and then to blend everything together
i'm going to use the morphe m4 for one
brush it's just another blending brush
and I'm just going to kind of blend
everything together so there isn't any
harsh lines especially here on the outer
part of my eye and this isn't even the
part that because when I thought about
it I was kind of maybe I shouldn't be
blending but I see other people blooding
so I'm like okay but this isn't the part
that I feel like I lose the halo effect
it's simply adding in all of those
colors feel like it kind of gets lost
but that's okay I'm just gonna just
going to keep trying so I think I got it
to where I wanted I think maybe I
actually came out just a little bit
better than the other I but I'm going to
pop off camera and do liner and lashes
and then come back to dip into the
palate a little bit more okay so liner
and lashes are on I'm going to put some
up the Maybelline master precise skinny
pencil this is in brown I'm going to put
that on my waterline and just so lightly
smudge it onto the lower lash line as
well at my morphe 36 brush and I'm going
to come in with the shade just peachy up
here this really pretty pink shade and
I'm just going to put that on the lower
lash line more towards the outer part of
my eye and the reason why I smudged a
little bit of the brow shadow from
Maybelline onto the lower lash is
because sometimes when me in particular
use pink on the lower lash line it can
kind of look like like sick so that's
why I put a little bit of brown there
and then I wasn't going to do this
because in the first look that I tried
out with this palette and I put a little
mini tutorial on Instagram I put bless
her heart on my bottom lash line and so
I wanted to do something different but
then I just like wasn't feeling just
peachy all the way so I decided to come
in with bless her heart
this gorgeous green shade right here and
I'm going to put that on the lower lash
line as well as using the same brush and
more towards the inner part of my eye
still kind of like merging the colors
together but just that bless her heart
is going to be a little bit more towards
the inner part I telling you guys when I
saw this palette and I saw bless her
heart that was what what like really
made me excited like I was like I have
to have this color I have like deeper
dark greens in my collection but I don't
have anything like this beautiful light
green and I just think it's gorgeous I
want to try to you do something on the
lid and that's what I was going to try
to do today like maybe pink on the
outside green on the inside or something
along those lines then I was like no
just leave it alone completely and then
that didn't happen and then for the
final step I'm going to use the more
feet e18 brush looks like this and I'm
just going to grab a little bit of
nectar which is right here and I'm going
to pop that on to the inner corner as an
inner corner highlight this shade as an
inner corner highlight is absolutely
bomb like can you see that it's insanely
insanely gorgeous this is what I used in
my other tutorial too so I was like a
little maybe I could do something
different with the inner corner but I'm
like no it's just it's too pretty it
calls to be an inner corner highlight
like that was nectar stalling I mean I
think it would look really pretty on the
lid as well and I've seen a lot of
people use it on the lid but inner
corner is just beautiful alright so that
is just a quick little demo of the eyes
I'm going to go put some lipstick on now
so I stop feeling so bare and then you
enjoyed that little demo here with the
shadows and now I wanted to jump in to
my review so first of all this is what
the palette looks like like a hard
plastic and then when you open it up it
is magnetic easy to open and close it's
just magnetic shut when you open it
there
is a mirror right here but I don't want
to blind you with it and then this is
what the inside of the palette looks
like so I mean obviously it's set up
very nice where it goes from like our
lighter colors and transition shades
over into the shimmery shades and then
the last row is the darker colors so I
mean you have a great variety you have
math you have shimmers you have the
lights you have all the way darks you
have like really fun pops of colors in
here the Pink's are very cool I don't
have a lot of pink in my eyeshadow
collection because I'm not big on
putting pink there but I saw Amanda
ensing she has like a pink look in her
snapchat the other day and I kept
watching our snaps over and over I was
like wait a second that is really pretty
so that was kind of my inspiration
because I've been wanting to do a pink
look but I just truly don't have any
pink shadows and so when I got this and
I was trying to think what to do for
today I was like I kind of want to lean
towards that pink look me as I just
thought it looked so pretty so very very
pretty shades my favorites nectar for
the inner corner is just absolutely
gorgeous bless her heart which is the
green I'm obsessed with that color I
think it is so beautiful luscious is
what i use today and it is so pigmented
and bright and it's so beautiful on
please i'm very excited to try some of
these darker colors especially like
delectable or top derby to me i have to
figure out how i would be able to use
them and see if i can like get my
creative juices flowing when i use them
but some are young and puree i have used
as well and they are gorgeous peaches
and cream i thought was a really good
one as like a matte lid that's what i
did in my first tutorial and white peach
is really pretty for like a brow bone
highlight that's what i've been using a
lot overall I can see myself reaching
for this palette so much not only in the
spring or summer time but there's also
these darker colors in here as well that
will be really good for fall and winter
but we don't really want to think about
fall and winter because I'm ready for
spring to actually get here so let's
just let's just not think about that for
right now this will be a great palette
or spring and summer and you have so
many different varieties there's so many
different things that you could do so
many diff
looks you could do with this palette
from an odd mad guy from shimmer eyes
two colors to neutrals there's just a
lot that you can do in here I was very
impressed so far with every shade that I
have used I've been very impressed with
the pigmentation out of every single
color that i have used so far which I've
use 123456789 IV is no 10 I've used 10
of the shades so far and I have loved
all of them and that to me is saying a
lot there's I mean there still are
obviously some that I haven't tried so
maybe there will be that done in there
and I actually haven't swatched
everything so when I give until the
swatches max we can see if maybe there's
like that one that you know maybe
doesn't work out there's always got to
be that one like there's always that one
in a palette that you're like nope but
so far from the ones that I've used I
have not found it yet and I'm just I'm
really really happy that I got my hands
on this I know that it's being a little
bit difficult to find it but honestly
I'm seeing it pop up more and in more
places and more people are getting it so
hopefully to face will understand that
people really do want this palette and
for a good reason beautiful shades in
here very pigmented lots of different
looks that you can do and of course it
smells like peaches I actually don't own
any of the chocolate pallets from to
face I am NOT a huge huge I shadow
palette girl just because like i was
saying there's always those shades that
you don't use in your palate and i like
to order from like makeup geek or i
recently ordered from Anastasio where
you can order the singles put them in a
Z palette you can have your own custom
appellate made of the shades that you
know that you're going to use but since
getting on YouTube and being a beauty
vlogger now and wanted to do more looks
and be able to show you guys more things
I'm slowly getting into the world of the
eyeshadow palettes buzz none of the
chocolate pallets really really spoke to
me but for some reason when i saw this
peach palette come out there i was like
i need this and I'm really happy that I
changed my mind and decided to pick up
the palette decided to go to alta 10
a.m. on a thursday morning when they
came
and pick up one of these pallets if you
guys can get your hands on it I
definitely would recommend it when I've
been seeing it come available I've left
my snapchat fam nope also trend mood one
on Instagram is a really good account to
follow they do a lot of updates on there
when makeup comes out and I think
they've done every single time the peach
palette has come available somewhere
they have news about it but again this
palette is just I mean it's just it's so
pretty it smells good there's so many
different looks you can do with it i'm
happy i bought it i feel like you're
going to see this in a favorites video
real soon and if you can like i said i
would definitely
you
whoa
Oh

hope you find it helpful and enjoyed my
little demo the swatches my little
review on it I feel like I just kept
repeating myself in my review but the
times that I have used this palette I
have just been so impressed with i'm so
happy with it i really hope that you
guys can get your hands on it if you can
if you are able to I definitely suggest
you pick this up I don't feel like you
will be disappointed very good palette
very impressed with your face putting
this together and okay I just wanted to
smell or more time I never knew that I'd
be a fan of like a peaches smell but
this ballot it's so funny because I
opened it up to start to do my makeup
and then the smell gets up to me and I
just like puts me in a better mood like
I don't know something about the peach
smell just like makes me happy probably
because it like makes me think of spring
