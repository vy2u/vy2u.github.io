video I'm pretty excited for because I
was challenged to pick my top ten
babysitter Club books and I feel like
I've talked about the baby-sitters club
a lot on my channel because it was what
I you know first started reading when I
was a young girl and you know of course
I read everything and the regular series
the mystery the super specials even like
babysitter's little sister I read even
though I felt like that kind of like I
was going backwards you know in my
reading like instead of reading more
challenging things and I start reading a
little sister and I'm like the soul well
too easy for me but just the baby
circuit club holds such a special place
in my heart if you are part of my
snapchat fam I kind of had like a short
story time on why I love the
baby-sitters club so much and what it
means to me but baby-sitters club I just
felt like takes some credit in my life
for helping me stay on a good path
imagine that you know I've had some bad
things happen in my childhood and it was
so nice to be able to escape into this
different world and you know like what's
more wholesome than the baby-sitters
club I learned so many lessons from them
I feel like I learned how to be a good
person how to get over obstacles like I
just really credit the baby-sitters club
a lot for helping me get through some
tough times so it just it really will
well the baby-sitters club will always
hold a special place in my heart so when
I was challenged to pick 10 I was very
nervous because I was like how do you
pick just 10 and I have to say I have 11
and someone in my snapchat fam said why
don't you just say it's your top ten and
an honorable mention so I have I think
eight from the regular series and then
two super specials and one mystery so
I'm going to say my mysteries like my
honorable mention hopefully that will
work but if you'd like to see my top ten
just was going through the list I was
writing down
books that when I saw the title it
immediately took my mind somewhere it
made me remember feelings that I felt
all greeting it it made me remember
lessons that I learned it made me
remember wanting to try something out
for myself like those are the books that
I want
to feature here not just books that I
thought like we're fun or funny or you
know the best to read but like things
that 10 years no 20 years after I've
read them 20 years after I've brought
them I can still recall vivid memories
so those are the ones that I wanted to
pick so those will be the ones that are
included in here but the first one of
course has to be Krusty's great idea
because obviously that's number one
that's what started everything that's
the what kicked off the entire
babysitter Club craziness so I sometimes
have to wonder if and I'm Martin knew
when she sat down to write this series
like what it would become because how
amusing I chose is Logan likes Mary Ann
I was booked at number 10 in the series
and I chose this one because who doesn't
love Logan and Mary Ann like they were
like the bomb couple they were they were
they were relationship goals before
relationship goals was even a hashtag
before there was even a hashtag you know
what I'm saying and I just I absolutely
loved their relationship and they were
everything the third one I picked I'm
not going in any specific order I'm
basically going in numerical order for
the books so I'm not like number 10 and
as number nine is so just gonna throw
that out there but the next one I have
on my list is Jesse's secret language
this was number 16 I remember reading
this and with the reason why I chose it
on my list is because I can recall where
I was sitting when I started reading
this book I was at my stepdads parents
house and they had a neighbor and they
had like a tree in their yard and I went
under there and sat under that tree and
read this book like I can recall that
memory and I remember another thing why
I loved it so much is because it made me
want to learn sign language in the book
jesse has to learn sign language for one
of her charges and I mean I went out and
I bought a book and I learned that like
a b c d e okay that's probably where i'm
gonna end but like i know there's like
some other random letters like i knew
sign language for a good while like a
few basic
very basic but I knew I could do every
single letter and I could do some like
basic words and sentences and that was
because this book inspired me to learn
sign language so thank you I have as
Marianne in the memory garden this was
number 93 and I remember this is because
Marianne loses a classmate in a car
accident and and I just remember not
experiencing death in my life up to this
point and just kind of the feelings that
it brought to me and what it made me
think about and you know it goes into a
lot of life and death and how to deal
with death and how to deal with that's
the friends and I just I can remember
reading it and feeling a lot of feelings
for it and being able to understand even
though I've never gone through it I felt
like I could understand
Marianne her feelings so does another
one that stuck out to me then we had
book 100 which was Christie's worst idea
which is where Christie wanted to
disable the baby-sitters club and I
remember reading this one like seeing it
was gonna come out and then picking it
up to read and being like no this series
can't end like what what's happening I
need a new book every single month of
what is going on this can't be the end
of it and yeah I can remember the
feelings that I brought in me like mom
know it's gonna be over it can't be over
it wasn't our bond there is Abby's point
and this is number 104 this is the book
where Abbie's twin sister gets diagnosed
with scoliosis and has to wear a brace
and all these like really bad things but
I remember then becoming super paranoid
that I was gonna have scoliosis and we
would have scoliosis test in our school
and I remember we tapped it was like
always during gym class and we would
have to go in you know take her like
baggy t-shirts off bend down and touch
her toes and they would like feel your
spine as you bent down and they would
like if you were okay like you could go
back out to gym and if you weren't okay
you had to go into the nurse's office
and they had to do another test on you
and I remember the day came I was either
in seventh or eighth grade because I was
at the middle school and I bent down and
they took me to the nurse's office
for further testing and I was just like
I'm gonna have to wear a brace and she
had to buy bigger shirts and like I
remember vividly feeling all these
feelings because I'd read it in the book
and I knew what to expect and like I was
ready for my scoliosis diagnosis but I
didn't have it so that was good the last
one that I have from the regular series
is the fire at Mary Ann's house which is
number 131 and I remember this one
because then after I read it I was just
for sure that our house was gonna bring
down I mean I made my mouth go out and
buy me it like a fireproof box and I put
really important things in it like books
and like I was like preaching to my mom
about fire safety and how we needed more
fire you know fireproof boxes in the
house and I was teaching my little
brother what we would do when the fire
started how it was get out like who's
gonna open the window and who's gonna
jump I was telling our neighbors like
when you see our house on fire you know
come over with a mattress because me and
John are gonna jump off the window and
we need to land on the mattress like I
was I was just for sure that our house
was gonna bring down at any moment
because of this book and I was so so
scared I can't remember for how long it
was that I was like into this but I
think both like my mom my brother and
the neighbors were like just I'm The
Specials that I picked out one was
babysitter's onboard which was the super
special number one and it's where they
all get to go on a cruise ship oh I've
never been on a cruise ship yet to this
day as I'm filming this but I remember
it just making me want to go on a cruise
so bad and I would like become obsessed
about it I would never leave my mom
alone
I was just we needed to go on a cruise I
probably read this book I don't even
know how many times I read this book I
would just constantly reread it because
it was so interesting for me to learn
like the different stops that they went
to I'm a huge travel bug too so that
probably I might have always been a huge
travel bug that probably had a lot to do
with it but I loved reading the
different places they were going you
know how they ate activities that they
going to do on there it's about another
one I have is babysitter's island
adventure which is the super social
number for this one I loved so much
it's where a couple of the babysitter's
go out with our charges they learn how
to do a boat what am I trying to say
steer a boat drive a boat sail a boat
you know and a storm comes and they end
up getting stuck on an island and this
book moved like moved me so much
I remember in it was an elementary
school no yes no I think it was in
elementary school it was either
elementary or middle school in China I
can remember I can see the classroom
that I'm in it was elementary school it
was elementary school I think I was in
either fifth or sixth grade because I
was on an upper level but I can remember
being in that classroom and we had to
write a report I don't exactly remember
what like the paper or the report was
supposed to be on but I basically like
plagiarized the Snapple I mean it was
about two friends who went out on a boat
with a bunch of little kids and they got
stuck and they had to spend the night in
a cave so I mean my very early works of
my books that I wrote were basically
plagiarized from Anna Martin and also
the Olsen twins the they had a book
series out I basically that's that's
what but really early early works are in
case anyone's wondering I do not write
my own stuff so don't worry but it did
this book just I just thought it was so
interesting I learned a lot of like
survival skills I feel like it's had a
lot of fun reading it I was so worried I
remember being like really scared but
they weren't gonna be rescued and I'm
like what's happening here and then the
last one so this should be number 11 and
my honorable mention because it's a
mystery novel and I'm sorry I couldn't
pick ten it was so hard I did a really
good job and I actually thought it went
through my initial list and I crossed
things off and I thought I got to ten
and I was so pumped and then I recount
it and I realized - it was 11 was a bad
night but I have the babysitter's
haunted house which is number one and I
can remember reading this my mom used to
play bingo like we would go to a bingo
hall and we'd have like the bingo
dabbers and get popcorn and like her
sisters came it was a big deal but when
I was the only child that would go with
her I would just bring my books and I
would read she'd usually let me like
play all game but I wasn't very into it
I would usually just sit there reading
this and being so scared and being in
this like crowded Bingle hall and people
are shouting and people are excited and
people are yelling bingo and I'm reading
and in my own world and so afraid and I
was like scooting closer and closer and
closer to my mom like mom I'm so scared
right now it was so funny but yeah
that's just a vivid memory that I have
that I can remember reading that book
and I don't think I read the full book
while we were up and go because those
like mysteries and super specials were
really thick books but I remember
reading a big chunk of it there just
being like terrified out of my mind all
