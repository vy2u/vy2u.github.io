channel so today's video is going to be
my top and must-have makeup brushes all
right of line I'm lying you guys have
already caught me in a lie
it's 11:00 I'm sorry I tried so hard to
get 10 because I just think that looks
so much nicer as a title like top 10
brushes it's 11 but I tried my hardest
try my hardest to get it to 10 but these
are like my favorite favorite brushes
brushes that I use all the time
constantly using in tutorials you guys
have probably seen them several times on
my channel like I just wanted to feature
my top top brushes that I think that you
should have so I'm so excited for this
video this was actually requested a few
weeks back I think it was right after I
did like my morphe haul and i've
mentioned something about like possibly
doing like a brush favorite type video
and there was a couple people that said
that they wanted to see that so i was
like okay let's do that
so yeah if you would like to see my
must-have makeup brushes please care
about with face brushes because that is
what I have the most stuff I think maybe
first hour of the face anyway is because
that's what we have to start with and
I'm going to start with the foundation
brushes I have two different foundation
brushes to talk about the first one is
from Sigma this is their flat kabuki it
is their f80 brush looks like this so
it's the kabuki style a flat top this
brush just like is very special to me
because this was like my very first like
real makeup brush that I bought and I
was just so excited actually my Sigma
brushes I ordered I think maybe like
three brushes in my first Sigma order
and they were my first like real brush
it is all so excited about it so the f80
like will always just hold a special
place in my heart for that reason but it
is $24 on the Sigma website and it's
just a brush that I go to all the time I
mean for a year this was my only
foundation brush and it worked fine I
mean I had to clean this bad boy so
often because I used it every single day
but I just I absolutely love this brush
so much I cannot
enough good thing is about it this is
one of Sigma's like top-selling brushes
and definitely for a good reason
so if you are in the market for a good
foundation brush or you're gonna place a
sigma order soon and you don't have the
f80 yet this is definitely one that I
would recommend and the other foundation
brush that i have is from morphe and
this is the m4 3:9 it looks like this
sorry it's still a little dirty I tried
to just like spot clean my brushes
before I came on here but I used most of
them before I came on so this looks
buffer brush it is $13.99 on the
Murphy's website where more fees are
really great brand because they have
great products that are a little bit
more on the affordable side so if you
can tell it's different from the kabuki
brush because it's more of a rounded
brush but it is still very tactically
densed just like the SAT which means
it's going to do a good job at packing
the foundation into your face and then
being able to buff it out as well and
which is you know you want to make sure
your foundation gets in there and stays
in there I really like this one because
it is so so soft as well that was one of
my first when I got this one and
compared it to my Sigma this one just
felt so much softer to me so I like
putting it on the skin still feels nice
and it actually was kind of worried
because of how soft it was I was like is
this really gonna do anything or is it
just gonna soak like I thought the brush
was gonna soak up the foundation and I
never worried about that with my Sigma
one but it really it does not it does a
great job it gives a really nice finish
and I just these two foundation brushes
are just I love them I also i definitely
recommend like if you're someone who
wears foundation frequently and you're
using foundation brushes
I mean having more than one in your
collection is a pretty good idea because
again a foundation brushes are one that
you do want to clean often because you
don't want to miss cleaning your brushes
and then your keep coming in and you're
just like spreading bacteria over your
face and that's not good but I hate
cleaning makeup brushes it's not fun for
me I don't really enjoy it so having a
couple that you can use and use this all
the other one is being cleaned and
drying it's just it's a good idea so
this is another favorite of mine
the
morphe M 439 another one that is a
favorite of mine that you guys have
probably seen in so many different
makeup tutorials is from morphe it is
the g2 looks like this this is their
pointer buffer brush and it is $13.99 on
the market website
this is what I use to buff in concealer
on my under eye and it's just who I was
watching different makeup brushes like
makeup recommendations because I was
getting ready to put in an order with
morphe this was a long long time ago not
my past morphe order but like a couple
more of the order's ago and I was
watching brush videos and so many people
kept bringing up this g2 and I was like
mmm I don't know like I got the Real
Techniques makeup sponge I have a little
brush from Sephora that sometimes I use
for concealer Mike I don't really need
this do I and I decided to get it just
because so many people are talking about
it use it almost every day
it really really is amazing and what I
like about it is that it's full when
it's fluffy at the same time and it just
does such a good job of pushing like the
product into your skin and blending it
out it does not take much work and also
because it's a little bit bigger like it
just is faster at doing it I have the 57
brush from Sephora that I would use for
this task but it's so much smaller it
would take me forever to be buffing out
concealer especially when you do the big
old triangle under your under eyes it
would take a really long time but
because this one is bigger it takes less
time all about that so this is just like
I said I use it every single day I love
it you know sometimes I'll use a Beauty
Blender especially if I have a new one
like I do now but this is just what I
always come back to it the more feet
okay and then my favorite blush brush
and just a brush that hands-down
recommend is the morphe e for looks like
this this is their angled contour brush
and it is $13.99 on the website but so
many people use this as a blush brush
this is a brush that I first heard of
from Jaclyn hill when she did her
because maybe like her morphe favorites
she mentioned this
blush and I've been in the market for a
different blush brush for a while I have
a couple dual fibers and I thought about
putting them in here because I think
dual fibers are good to have in your
collection for blush especially with
color pop blush I'm a big color pop fan
and I have a couple of their blushes
they have such a different consistency
that duo-fiber really works the best for
them versus more of like a fluffy brush
but they just aren't my favorite you
know what I'm saying like I just I
wanted this to be like my absolute
hands-down favorite and this efore from
morphe is just I love it the first time
I use so that was like yes we just
became best friends but it's so nice to
place like on the apples of the cheek
you can pack it in and it does a good
job packing the blush on or you can
sweep it on for a lighter look and I
just think it's it's just it's so pretty
I it it's so weird because I'm actually
not a big blush person and sometimes I
just forget to put blush on I'm not
gonna lie like some people just
absolutely love blush I can take it or
leave it I don't have a huge blush
collection I know I've been tagged a
couple of times to do the blush tag
that's floating her on YouTube and it's
like all these different questions and
you have to like pick a blush for each
question I own like five blushes one
tooth five I own five lashes and then a
blush palette so you know six I don't
own that many blushes and they don't get
me excited but I get excited to pick up
the this brush so I feel like that's not
something right and some more feet it is
the e4 if you're looking for a good
blush brush check this one out
the next one that I have is from morphia
as well and it is their e3 it looks like
this I'm sorry I totally forgot to spot
clean this one who is this one's dirty
but it's dirty for a reason
because I use it every single day
everyday I'm obsessed with this brush
I'm obsessed with it I was seeing it
like started to pop up in people's
videos and I was like that's an
interesting-looking brush like I don't
really have anything like that I didn't
have a brush to use for the specific
reason that I wanted to purchase it for
I don't know if that makes any sense but
basically what I use the ìiî for is to
dust loose powder on my face so I really
like the Maybelline loose powder and I
will just dust it all over
phase two set my foundation I think this
works great it's also really good if you
do any like baking under your under eyes
or on your face and you just need
something clicked like wife the powder
away this works great for that I have a
couple of just like not loose powders
but powder foundations that like days
where I just don't really want to do
foundation or maybe I just do like a BB
cream or tinted moisturizer and then I
just want a little oomph with like some
powder on top this is the brush I use
like I just I love this brush so much
and seriously I feel like so many other
people do because I'm looking at the
morphe website it's their precision
pointed powder brush it's out of stock
I'm fairly confident when I filmed my
latest Murphy haul and I featured this
in here it was out of stock so I'm
seeing a lot more people talk about it
clearly it's been out of stock I'm
working for a while like other people
are really loving it and for good reason
I think it's bomb the e3 another brush
that I think is so important and again
one that I use every single day is from
ELF cosmetics so you know it's gonna be
affordable it is their small tapered
brush you guys have probably seen this
in a lot of tutorials it's kind of like
the e3 but like a little mini baby
version of it but what I use this for is
to set powder underneath my eyes like to
set my concealer basically what I was
trying to say but I use it to put powder
on my under eyes and I just love it I
use it every single day any time that I
have concealer on my under eyes this is
the brush that I'm using to put the
powder on underneath and it was two
dollars two dollars for an everyday
brush like I mean you just simply can't
beat that there's a lot of other
companies that have brushes that
literally are like the exact same thing
and they're charging double and triple
and quadruple the price but seriously
elf small tapered brush either that
target that's where I got mine I think
even like my grocery store carries elf
products in there and they're awesome
elf I think it's the white handles are
one dollar which is pure insanity and
then the black handles are two dollars
pretty much confident on
so yeah if you're looking for just a
good under-eye brush get that powder on
there elf small tapered $2 and I think
this is going to be my last like a face
brush it's from morphe as well and
they're just BM a 501 if you guys are on
youtube and you probably know that this
is used for highlighting if you don't
and this is used for highlighting this
is such a loved highlighter brush and I
couldn't get it for the longest time
because as I was placing orders with
morphe this bugger was always sold out
and I was so bummed about it but again I
found it from Jaclyn Hills favorites
like she was constantly using the 501 to
highlight and then everyone else started
using the 501 to highlight and I was
like I want the five little one and then
I finally got it and I was so excited it
is $7.99 on the morphe website it's
called the pro pointed blender but again
so many people use it as a highlight it
has just like this great little tulip
shape and it comes to a point right at
the very end and it's so perfect like if
you just tap it into your foundation and
get it on that little point and then
spread it on it just it does an amazing
job I had like a fan brush I had a it
was actually a concealer brush I'm
pretty sure it was and I just I thought
they were okay but like nothing was
really like blowing me away when it came
to my highlight and if ever one has
totally upped my highlight game totally
so the Emma 501 if you're looking for a
good highlighter brush this is what I
would recommend
so my first I brush that I have to talk
about is like one of my oh geez BH
Cosmetics is like the first company that
I ordered makeup from like before I was
on YouTube like when I was just like
starting to try to understand makeup I
was ordering like eyeshadow palettes and
brushed kits and things like that from
BH Cosmetics because they're so
affordable and I think they're very like
beginner friendly but a brush that I
picked up because everyone was like if
you want to learn how to do eye makeup
you need a blending brush you need a
blending brush a blending brush a
blending brush and I was like okay so I
got this blending brush from BH
Cosmetics it just looks like this if you
guys have been on my channel for a while
or if you
any of my old tutorials like this is the
brush that I'm constantly using I
recently like try to kind of step up my
brush game and order more from like
morphe and Sigma and places like that
and I kind of thought once I started
ordering blending brushes from those
companies that my BH Cosmetics brush was
just gonna like no longer be but that is
not the case and I just I still love it
I still use it so frequently you know
not quite as much because it's basically
what I was using every single time I did
an eye makeup look until I bought a
couple new brushes and now I can finally
like let this one breathe let this one
breathe a little bit but it's a really
great blending brush it's very big it's
very fluffy and so it's not good if you
want something like defined in the
crease or if you only want crease Burke
you know things like that because it's
so fluffy it kind of makes product go
everywhere but sometimes like when I'm
in a hurry and I want to just like lay
one eyeshadow down I kind of wanted in
the crease but it can go up and it can
go on my lid like no big deal it's kind
of like an all-in-one brush I guess to
me this is what I use it for I cannot
find it on the BH website right now
I bought it alone like this was not in a
kit like most of my other BH brushes
about this one on its own and there's
been so many times that I can find it on
the BH site because I've linked to it so
many times in other tutorials so I'm
gonna keep looking to see if maybe I can
find it but just a good old basic
blending brush from BH Cosmetics I just
wanted to mention it because I just I
use it so much it's definitely and I
have the two more blending brushes for
the eyes blending brushes are definitely
one that I think that you should have
multiples of and hope so glad that I'm
finally getting more because it's so
frustrating when you go in with
different colors you're constantly
having to clean your brushes or else
you're gonna like make a mess on your
eyes like you need several several
blending brushes can't have too many but
to that I want to talk about they're
very very similar to each other but
they're different in price so you know
that's why I was like maybe I can get
away with like still calling this my top
ten you know you know what I'm saying so
the first one that I have is at the
Sigma e25 blending brush this is what it
looks like again this was ordered along
with my f80 kabuki brush and so it's
just like
my first like real blending brush like
it just is so exciting to me it's just
stuff I just love it but I like it
because it's still very firm and like
kind of pointed toward the end and so it
helps like keep the colors just where
you want it to go versus the BH brush
which can kind of like go all over this
is much much better at keeping colors
you want them to go which I very much
appreciate it does such a fabulous job
blending like if you want to get a good
blended look
the e25 from Sigma is just the way to go
I love it on the website it is $14 so
wanted to mention this one because
definitely one of my favorites I use it
nearly every day I used it today but
then the other one that I wanted to
mention is the morphe m43 3 so you can
see very very similar to the Sigma one
but this one is $5.99 on the morphe you
website so I can kind of like put them
together so here they are side by side
the Sigma e25 and the more PM 4-3-3
definitely very very similar they do the
same jobs one is just about you know
half the price so I think that's pretty
awesome if you're looking for something
more affordable I would check out morphe
if you're a fan of Sigma you're gonna
place an order with Sigma check out the
e25 but they're both fantastic I love
them both I use them both nearly every
single day I'm happy that I have like
two of basically the same brushes
because when one's dirty I can use the
other one that sort of thing you know I
always take turns cleaning these guys
this will never be cleaned like deep
cleaned at the same time because I can't
lose them both to being dry but yes the
Sigma e25 at the more pm 4-3-3 to
fabulous of blending brushes and then
the last brush that i have is from
morphe and it is the e36 it's just this
tiny tiny little guy this is the detail
crease brush and again I feel like
everyone's starting to understand that
this brush is just like so needed
because it's out of stock I think this
might have been out of stock when I know
this I don't think this one was out of
stock when I did my more because I want
to say that I saw the price and it was
like a $5.99 again as well or $4.99
something like that so I mean it's just
this tiny detail crease brush like it
says but what I use it for is to push
shadows onto my lower lash line and kind
of buff them out and I think it's
fabulous for this and mentioned it in my
morphe video that I just really didn't
have a brush like this I had pencil
brushes but they were either too big or
they were too stiff or they just coming
irritated my under eye and I just I
didn't love them and I never felt like I
could get a good smoky lower lash line
like you know when you see that lower
lash line that's just like smoked out to
perfection I'm like how do people get
that I don't understand it and then once
again
Saud and Jaclyn Hills favorites and
that's like what she always uses for
under eyes and then I thought let's
relax didn't I thought does he did it
and I was like okay I'm gonna need to
get me the e36 and I have not regretted
it and used this every single day that
I'm putting a shadows on my lower lash
line this is the only brush that I use
now this is the only one the e36 I want
more of these I actually ordered I'm
pretty sure this is the brush I actually
ordered two of these in my latest more
if you order like on accident and I
think you're gonna see it in an upcoming
giveaway and my two thousand subscriber
giveaway I'm pretty sure that you 36 is
gonna be in there so watch out for that
but the e36 for the lower lash line and
that is everything for my top must-have
