thank you for stopping by today today's
video I'm going to be doing my top 15
drugstore beauty pics of 2015 now i'm
not sure i have 15 I might have closer
to 20 but I was trying to get as close
to 15 as I possibly could and you know
some things I talk about lip colors I
have a few different lip shades to talk
about I don't know what we're getting is
close to 15 as we can because 2015 is of
course almost a distant distant memory
it is almost time to ring in 2016 and I
am so excited I absolutely love the
start of a new year I love the start of
a new month like I just I just love it
something about it something about
starting fresh I'm into it now you may
notice I have a different setting going
on I am trying to film in a different
area of my house I'm actually filming in
my yoga room and we do have a big window
in it and we have closet doors behind us
so I just put up a sheet for right now I
know the sheet is probably not in the
best condition because I just kind of
like sounded and stole it but I'm trying
something new I don't know if it's going
to work out I might not even post this I
might just go back into my regular room
and try but I wanted to do something
different i'm hoping to get a few
different backdrops but one of my
resolutions for 2016 is hitting it hard
with youtube i have been loving my time
on youtube so much and I really want to
give it a hundred and forty percent in
2016 so trying new things please bear
with me as I do Abba yes so a little bit
different location today I also did
mention to my snapchat friends this
morning when I was talking about filming
this video that I thought about doing a
high-end video of to but because i
didn't get on youtube until May and I
really didn't find that much high-end
before I came on here I don't have a
whole lot of products to talk about so I
don't think it would be a very good
video honestly I'm just going to do the
drugstore for now but then I also i'm
going to do my favorites of december it
just might come a little bit later in
the month but i am still going to do the
favorites video for december
because I have a lot to talk about but I
really wanted to get this one out here
too just so you guys can see what I
loved at the drugstore there is a lot of
really great products coming out the
drugstore I went shopping today I picks
them up have a drugstore haul coming for
you soon that's all I have left to say
why don't we just jump into my favorite
drugstore pics of 2015 I have this
neutrogena the ultra ultra light
cleansing oil and this oil I have just
been loving I picked it up on a whim at
target and have ended up completely
falling in love with it and it's such a
light oil on the skin I like to use it
for removing makeup I like to use it
even after I do remove my makeup and
then I want to make sure I got my makeup
off like maybe I had a heavy makeup day
I use this and it gets everything off
still light on the skin it smells so
good it feels good going on I love it a
cleanser that I really love is this
clean and clear morning burst um says
the facial cleanser oil free with
bursting beads I love using it in the
morning that's kind of like what it's
specifically designed for its smell is
supposed to help wake you up but I love
it I i use it quite a bit I mean I
haven't had it for that long and i'm
already about halfway through it and i
use this almost on the daily a makeup
remover that i wanted to talk about is
these all my eye makeup remover pads i
have been buying these makeup remover
pads for years and I mean probably since
back in my college days I I mean these
are just always always in my drawer
whenever I see always having a sale this
is what I stock up on I love them
they're small and round they're easy to
use one or two to take off your eye
makeup depending on how much eye makeup
you have on but then I even use them to
remove my liquid lipstick because liquid
lipstick is harder to remove and because
they are so small if I doing like a
dramatic I look I can take the the pad
and just shoosh and help clean up my eye
and that way I'm not wasting like a
whole facial makeup remover Pat so I
love these and then one last skin care
to talk about is a moisturizer and this
is from a Garnier it's the moisture
rescue refreshing gel cream
and I am almost out of it if you guys
can see I do not have a lot left I
absolutely love this stuff this is
another that I have been buying for
years and I will always have in my
collection I love it so I don't know
what it is if it's because I'm in a new
setting but I realize like I feel like I
don't know what to do with this hand
when I'm not using it it's like I don't
know i don't i have no idea why that is
but sorry i forgot weird hand fighting
going on but next I want to talk about
foundations I love drugstore foundation
and you will be able to tell the first
brand I want to talk about is Maybelline
I have three different foundations from
Maybelline hopefully these are all in
the frame I love Mabley they are my
favorite drugstore brand by far but I
have been so impressed with the
foundations so the first one that really
like got me was just their regular old
fit me foundation I have it in 225 it
has SPF 18 in it I love it I think it's
great then they came out with the fit me
matte and poreless and I became quickly
obsessed with this I have it in 230
natural buff this is so good especially
in the summer or if you have oily skin
because it helps keep you Matt all day
long these are so long lasting so
wearable I really really love them and a
good thing about the matte and poreless
is that it doesn't have SPF in it which
means if you know that you're going to
be doing something where you're taking a
lot of pictures you don't want to wear a
foundation or a lot of makeup with SPF
in it for fear of getting that white
flash back so this is a really good
option and then this I was sent to me
was sent to me in an influencer box if
you guys are not familiar with
influenster I talked about them a lot
they will be linked in the description
box below is basically that you can
receive free products to review and use
your social media influence to be able
to earn more boxes and that sort of
thing but I had a full-size butter skin
foundation sent to me from Influenster
which was so amazing the color was just
a tiny bit too light for me especially
because I received this in the summer
where I'm just a little bit tanner but I
just use
a few drops i have a l'oreal true match
foundation just in a little glass bottle
and i have it as a really dark
foundation because then i just use a
drop and mix it in with something that's
too light for me and it worked out
perfectly now i don't need those traps
because it's winter and i'm quite pale
so i can use this on its own and i just
i love it the smell is a little freaky
but that's okay like look how dirty this
is I'm sorry I should have cleaned that
does have a pump on it which makes it so
easy and the fit meas do not have pumps
which really sucks so this has a pump
which I love and it's better skin
foundation because it is made with act
I'll see and it's supposed to actually
help improve your skin over time so very
good foundation i actually just picked
up the better skin concealer today and
I'm really excited to try that out
another foundation that I really love is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation
and it is also in this class bottle and
again it is so dirty why I didn't clean
anything I don't know I apologize hey it
is w5 warm a little bit on the light
side again but I love it for winter
especially because of the luminous
foundation which means in the winter
when I'm very dry and my skin does not
have a lot of glow eNOS to this I can
use this and it really helps make my
skin luminous which I love does have a
pump very easy to use very blendable on
the skin love it a concealer that I've
really been loving is the Maybelline fit
me concealer and I believe my shade is
in 10 light like I said I did pick up
the Maybelline better skin concealer
today I also picked that up and light
them pretty sure because I hear really
good things about it but again
maybelline their products are just so
good this is my like go to concealer if
you guys can see like I'm about out of
that but that's what the applicator
looks like it's very easy to apply very
easy to use very easy to blend lemon a
setting powder that I wanted to talk
about because this has been I mean I use
this nearly every single day it's the
Rimmel stay matte translucent powder and
it's just a translucent powder it's long
wearing I put it where I put my
concealer like under my eyes especially
it helps keep them from creasing and
skip the concealer in place and it keeps
me Matt again I have had this for such a
long time rimmel is such an affordable
brand if you're looking for a
translucent powder good I bronzer that I
have found is the NYX a matte bronzer my
shade is in medium it does come with a
mirror and then it has a lot of product
in here I've probably had this one for
over a year I still have not hit pan on
it and I use it quite frequently it's
the bronzer I have on today but it's
just a really good affordable matte
bronzer there's no shimmer in it at all
and it comes in a few different shades
also think I did want to mention too i
meant to say this in my intro is all the
items that i mentioned are drug store
items they are not just affordable items
even though i love more feat and i love
color pop and i love makeup geek those
are drugstore prices but you can only
find them online and so I really wanted
to mention only things at the drugstore
because I know a lot of you guys like to
go to your drug stores you like to go to
target and CVS and you know a lot of
these items can be found in Alta as well
say this blush is new to me I just
picked it up because everyone told me
that I should and I don't understand why
I haven't bought it before it is the
Milani baked blush in luminaux so why
didn't I have this in my life for so
long it makes me so mad it is such a
beautiful blush I have it on right now
it is a blush that I like to use like
today I have very minimal makeup on I
have eyelashes on and I have a brown
lipstick on i have on limbo from
colour-pop and so I didn't want to
really do anything crazy with my eyes
because i knew i was going to have a
brown lip so i just like loaded on this
blush and I could just keep putting it
on all day oh I just love it the color
is so so beautiful it has a little bit
of shimmer to it but not too much this
is such a good blush I'm not going to be
able to live without this a few
eyeshadows that i wanted to mention i'm
not huge into drug store eyeshadows it
seems like I'm honestly really not that
huge into eyeshadows in general I don't
usually buy a lot of pallets I don't
usually buy a lot of individual I
shadows but we do need eye shadows but
these two I think are so amazing and I
she just recently used both of these in
my New Year's Eve makeup tutorial but it
is the Loreal infallible eyeshadows
system in my most recent makeup tutorial
I've worn these colors in weddings the
colors i have are in ice to latte and
liquid diamond I think they are so
beautiful I also did pick one up today
for you guys for my 1k giveaway so that
will be something that you will be
seeing in the next giveaway coming up
for mascara I'm not huge into drugstore
mascara either I really like two-faced I
really like tart mascara Lancome mascara
but I do really love the define a lash
mascara from Maybelline i have used this
in several of my tutorials I think it is
especially great for the lower lash line
the line just felt like little and
precise I think it really helps the
lower lash line but it also really does
help lengthen the eyelashes and I really
love that about it I did pick up a new
maybelline mascara today at the
drugstore that i'm going to try out i
think it was the last lash sensational
i'll let you guys know what I think but
yeah if you need just a good like
especially lengthening drugstore mascara
I would check this one out I didn't want
to include eyelashes in here because i
love eyelashes and I wear them
frequently and hands down like the best
drugstore eyelashes are ardell our dell
comes out with some fabulous eyelashes
they have a huge line you can buy them
in like single packs like this you can
buy them in multiple packs you can buy
individual eyelashes they have natural
they have semi-natural they have
dramatic they have wispies and they're
always so affordable I love them I they
just recently had a sale at my cps the
other day I think it was like buy two
get one free and I bought a lot of
eyelashes but if you're new to the
eyelash game and you're not quite sure
yet I would say start off with our dell
that is what i did but then I realized
they are just that good everyone needs
them okay then just two more sections to
talk about I want to talk about brushes
and I want to shout out elf brushes if
you can get the drug stores you can get
a target I have all of these from the
black line which I think these ones are
three dollars they also have a
white-handled brushes and I think those
are only a dollar i usually get online
at target but these brushes clearly are
so affordable if you just heard me say a
dollar in three dollars they are so
affordable they're the first brushes
that I started buying once I started
getting into makeup and I think they are
great this small tapered brush I use
every single day without fail this is
what I use to set my under eye concealer
and I think it's amazing I know a lot of
people use brushes like this to apply
highlighter as well but what I use to
apply my highlighter is this flawless
concealer brush close up of it it's just
so easy to get right in there and apply
my highlighter I love it I like them a
lot more than a fan brush I just think
it's more precise when placing my
highlighter then I also have this small
stipple brush it's a little bit dirty
because sometimes i use it because it's
a duo fiber brush sometimes I'll use it
for my color pop blushes but what I
actually really love to use this for is
when I cream contour I use this brush to
apply and buff out the contour in my
cheekbones and I think it works really
really well for that the final items
that I want to mention our lip products
and I recently just bought these they
are the NYX soft matte lip creams and I
don't know why I waited so long and I'm
so stinking impressed with them so this
is a shade that I have in London it is a
extremely light brown nude shade like
pinky nude on my hand but it's more
Brown when I wear it on my lips I
absolutely love it but I feel like I
could put on these soft matte lip creams
all day like I could just sit there and
keep applying them because they are so
soft on the lips they also dry matte
which I really like they do not make my
lips sticky and they stay on for a
pretty long time they don't stay on as
long as like a liquid lipstick would but
they don't wear off like a regular
lipstick one and it's Nick's it's
affordable they have several different
shades this one is in london i also have
I think of Milan and it's a bear
bright pink I must have forgot to bring
that one up but this one is definitely i
absolutely love London I've been wearing
it all the time and if you think I'm
done talking about Maybelline I'm not
done talking about Maybelline yet their
lipsticks are some of the best lipsticks
hands down I absolutely loved their
lipsticks I need to give a special shout
out to their Matt line there matte
lipsticks are so good I had to buy one
for my best friend for Christmas because
I was like she's a beauty lover like me
and I was like I know you need this in
your life if you don't have any I'm
gonna give you more so I have the color
clay crush and this is kind of what
started it all it looks kind of similar
looks a little bit similar to London not
going to lies we clearly know that I
have favorite shades so we have london
from nicks and then clay crash views do
dr.mat as well they aren't like it
liquid lipstick or even like the soft
matte lip cream and that they do wear
off pretty easily they're not trans for
proof at all if I take a drink if I
because my husband is going to transfer
but they are just so beautiful i get so
many compliments on them their shade i
picked up as touch of spice and oh my
god the second I put this on I was like
we just became best friends it is such a
beautiful like deep what would you even
how would you even describe touch of
spice I thought the sheet was going to
fall down on me I'm so like
uncomfortable right now getting out of
my my comfort zone I'm like oh gosh I
just want to be finished filming this
video but it's like a pink and rose it's
got a little bit of red in it may be a
little bit of like a brown undertone but
I just think it's so beautiful and
whenever I wear it I get so many
compliments when I wear it in a video
people are asking what I'm wearing it's
a touch of spice maybelline Matt every
day I have for my top 15 drugstore pics
