are you doing today Oh quite well this
video is going to be another top-five
Tuesday video but it's going to be a
little bit different instead of talking
about like books our products or things
like that I'm actually going to be
giving my top 5 moments since starting
Chiclets plus so I'm excited for this
video I had a lot of trouble picking my
top 5 moments that yeah it was pretty
tough to pick my top 5 moments so some
of them aren't like specific moments
there like a lot of moments that I grew
up into one or just like events are out
of how things like that but it was so
hard to pick because chocolate plus has
been around since 2009 so that's a long
time and a lot of memories made and
special moments that have happened for
me like I probably missed a zillion
zillion things out there bleh I kind of
hit everything that I feel like it's
been really important to me over the
years since starting a chiclet plus and
getting into the book and the blogging
business hopefully I'm not freaking
anyone out with this yellow shirt this
is the only yellow shirt I have my
closet like legit only yellow shirt I
have green and yellow because I'm a
Packer fan but any cheese heads
subscribe to my channel anyone watching
that words for the Packers because
football season is right around the
corner and now getting pumped up for it
but anyways this is my only like yellow
shirt and for some reason I was just
scrolling through my closet today and
was like i'm gonna wear yellow i have no
idea yet how this is gonna look on
camera but hey we're gonna roll with it
but anyways if you would like to see my
top 5 moments since starting my baby
Chiclets plus please keep watching ok so
Chiclets plus is my book blog that I
started back in 2009 and kind of why I
started it is I knew that I wanted to
write a books myself one day but I kind
of always had that saying in the back of
my head that my mom always told me was
it's not what you know it's who you know
and I knew no one in the industry no one
in publishing no one in bugs nothing
like that so I thought what's the best
way that I can start to make connections
and looking around I found a few
different book blogs and I thought okay
that could be a way I'm an avid reader I
don't have a whole lot of friends who
are big reader
so I really didn't have anyone to talk
about what about the books that i was
reading and so I thought well why not
make a blog I can do my book reviews and
maybe I can meet other people and we can
talk about books i could find more books
and the main goal was to make the
connections to one day publish a book so
in october of 2009 ready to graduate
college i bought myself my first laptop
which is actually still the laptop i
used today i have no idea how it is less
of the song but i bought a laptop I
hired a web designer to create chiclet
plus for me and I start it from there
book blogs honestly were not huge back
in 2009 like blogging was like sort of
getting trendy but at the same time it
almost had a stigma to it like you have
a blog like mmm it kind of had that
stigma attached to it which was kind of
interesting because then I mean within
years it absolutely blew up everyone has
a blog about anything now and it was
kind of crazy but I didn't have a whole
lot to go on like I said there was a few
other blogs out there that I was kind of
looking at and seeing what content they
were doing but I really wanted to make
it my own thing and I knew that I didn't
want to make it only book focused
because i have so many different
interests and passions which is where
the name chicklet plus came from i knew
i wanted to focus on books chuckle it
was my favorite subject to read and to
write about and write reviews for but i
didn't want to be only in that genre and
i didn't want to be only books when
chiclet plus first started out we shared
recipes and had you know lifestyle
reviews we also did like celebrity news
and when i say we i mean me for probably
the first three four years of chocolate
plus i was the only one writing the
articles now I have a wonderful review
team I have contributors for articles
and it's great but Chiclets plus has
definitely moved and changed throughout
the years I took away the celebrity
aspect just because I think celebrity
websites are just everywhere you can get
them on your phone like it just to me I
just didn't feel like celebrity news is
really contributing or adding anything
to Chiclets plus so these days we focus
mainly on the book reviews we now offer
a lot of services for authors such as
like marketing proofreading blog tours
we have a newsletter
I think thirteen hundred subscribers
that you know we send out book
information to the subscribers we also
still do of course the beauty and the
fitness and the lifestyle reviews but a
lot of those are now being done here on
YouTube so that's kind of a little bit
of a background on Chiclets plus and
Chiclets plus to me is what started
everything it's what started my entire
foray into this industry in 2011 I did
publish my first book destined to fail I
started my own publishing company which
is called marching ink I'll have 11
books published 12 books published i
have four published books myself i have
one in a collection it's just it's been
incredible I now I offer a lot of
services for authors and I've been able
to work with so many different authors
I've been able to work with different
readers I've been able to travel around
the United States do book signings meet
authors who mean so much to me and it's
just it's just been incredible and I
really do credit chiclet plus for
starting it all I mean Chiclets plus was
the number one thing that got me into
this and I'm just so grateful for that
random idea one night sitting in my
apartment thinking how in the world am I
going to make something of my life how
am I going to make sure I do what I love
and to think starting a blog started all
of this is just so crazy to me so I mean
my I get asked advice all the time for
people who you know I want to do you
know maybe something like me or maybe
something along the same lines as me but
not with books there Beauty you know
whatever your passions is my biggest
biggest biggest piece of advice is to
just go for it when I was what 19 20 21
years old I don't know how it was when I
started this I did not have a lot of
money at the time to buy a laptop and
then to also pay for someone to design a
blog for me that was a huge huge deal
for me that was I mean that was so risky
to me to do that and not know if it
would pan out especially because chiclet
plus a blog you know I I offer
advertising but you don't really make
any money with a blog so to know that I
was going to be doing something and
basically just crossing my fingers and
saying hey I hope this works out but I'm
not going to see any money back from it
for probably a long time that was really
scary to me so I definitely do
understand you know if you have the
money issues and things like that and
you're just not sure if you can do it
try I mean obviously try to make it work
but try to see if you can be inventive
in the ways that you do it I just
started YouTube in April and I wasn't
sure it was something that was going to
pan out for me so I didn't go out and
buy a brand new fancy camera I didn't go
out and buy any lights I film solely off
of my s6 android phone I just used the
camera feature film off my phone I have
a crazy stand I posted a picture on
Instagram I have a huge pile of books on
top of that i have a canister that i put
my nail polish is in on top of that i
have a box with a bubblehead in it on
top of that is my phone I have no fancy
tripod I have no lights I only film in
front of my window because I don't feel
like I can afford to go out and buy a
fancy camera if I wasn't sure I was
going to be doing YouTube for the long
haul and I didn't really have another
reason to buy a camera if that makes
sense so if you can get creative if you
can borrow something from friends or if
there's something around your house or
something to be able to at least kick
start it i really suggest doing it I
just that is truly truly my biggest
piece of advice is to just try it and go
for it because you never know what will
happen I honestly have wanted to be so
many things in my life you guys I have
thought I wanted to be a travel agent I
thought I wanted to be a wedding planner
I I thought I wanted to do all these
different things and what I did was
either i worked jobs or I volunteered or
interned and I tried them out and
obviously none of those things panned
out because that's not what I do anymore
but I at least can say that I tried it
was like you know what nope that wasn't
for me and I didn't hold on to anything
and always have to wonder like oh maybe
that is what I wanted to do with my life
if I only I would have just tried that
so I'm going off on a whole tangent that
is totally not this video is about but
it's just a question that I get asked so
much is how
why start or how do i begin or where do
I even begin and honestly it's just with
step one just giving it a try anyways I
will stop preaching because ain't nobody
here for that we are here from my top 5
moments since starting Chiclets plus I
just wanted to give you a little
backstory on what chocolate pluses and
why I started it and now let's get into
the mice so my moment number one a
feeling that I was going to be taken
seriously and that chocolate plus was
going to be taken seriously and there
honestly there is one specific moment
that I recalled us happening that I
wanted to talk two years about but
basically Chiclets plus have been
running for a few months at the time and
I was doing book reviews and I was
writing the articles and you know
sharing recipes and things like that but
I thought wouldn't it be really cool if
I could interview an author and share an
interview on my blogs like wouldn't that
bring in more traffic wouldn't readers
be interested in reading these
interviews with authors and then my next
thought was nobody's gonna want to do an
interview with me like why are they
gonna waste my time I have like two page
views a day and one is probably my mom
like no one's given to want to do an
interview and waste their time with me
finished reading a book by Carol
Lockwood and I think it was like I do
and then I don't a wedding book I just
finished reading that book I googled
Cara's name and I found her online and I
found her social media and I ended up
finding her email address and I was like
I'm just gonna email her say Who I am
and see what happens so I emailed her I
said who I was but who am I blog was
what I was looking for you know I just
checked her book out at the library
reddit loved it going to be reviewing it
would she had all be interested in an
interview that I could run as well
within three hours Cara had emailed me
back and said yes I opened up that email
and it sounds I'm sure just to some of
you especially if you're like bigger
book bloggers you might think that
sounds so silly but this was the very
first time an author was responding to
me like now that she was seeking me out
I was seeking her out but she was
actually responding to me
she said yes and we did an interview and
it ran I did her book review and I just
remember feeling totally overwhelmed and
feeling like hey someone took me
seriously and I just interviewed a real
author I just interviewed someone who
has published books I just interviewed
someone who I rather book it was it was
such a highlight for me honestly and
that happened just a few months after I
started chicklet plus it was such a
highlight I was like telling everyone I
knew I called my mom called my boyfriend
at the time was like can you believe it
i'm interviewing a real author like it
was that was a really fun moment for me
then that kind of segues into my top
moment number two these aren't in any
particular order by the way I'm not like
that was my most number one moment
they're kind of scattered all about but
my next top moment was me being
contacted by Jackie Collins's agent this
happened chicklet plus had been running
I believe this was in the spring
chicklet plus started in October and I'm
fairly confident I got the email the
following spring from Jackie's agent and
they were just saying hey we want to
know if we can send you a view copy of
Jackie's latest book and would you like
to interview her I I I can remember
sitting on my bed in the apartment i was
living in at the time having my laptop
on my legs reading my email and seeing
that email come through and I just felt
like I had won the freaking lottery I
could not believe it i feel like i'm
gonna get emotional in every single
moment i talked about but it was so
extreme to me but plus wasn't even
around for a year yet and i was being
asked to read and review a book by
jackie collins and to interview her like
I couldn't even believe it I worked
really really hard on like my social
media following when i first started
chiclet plus I worked really hard on
getting a Facebook page up I had to
learn Twitter which was fairly new at
the time and I didn't quite understand
it the only reason I got it was because
of Chiclets plus some people said
Twitter was the new thing so I made
myself get it and learn it but I worked
really hard on trying to build up
readers build up pageviews build up my
social media and to think that somehow
that
across to the people of Jackie Collins
was just so crazy to me and now I have
such I don't think it was the same
publicist several years ago that
contacted me for Jackie but even now to
this day I have a really good
relationship with Jackie's PR person I
get sent every single one of Jackie's
books I did interview her a few years
ago her interview was running on
chocolate plus i will put all these
links to everything that i talked about
throughout this video they will all be
below for you guys to read and look at
and things like that but I just feel so
lucky because Jackie Collins is like an
icon in the book world and to be able to
know that's like oh I just I felt so
special and I felt so like I honestly
felt like in that moment I knew I had
made the right decision and I knew I was
on the right path it was like it was
like I just I just knew it that was the
moment where I just had a feeling like
yes you made the right decision so
moment number three is such such a huge
huge moment and I believed this happen
in 2011 so been around for about two
years um it was also around the time
where something borrowed was being
filmed for movie and that is the book by
emily giffin emily giffin is such a
well-known author especially in like the
chiclet women's fiction community her
books are absolutely wonderful I've read
all of them Something Borrowed was
turned into a movie and there's talks I
don't really ever know what's going on
with something blue it seems like it's
always something different there but it
was around that time I got an email from
someone on Emily's team asking if I
would do an interview with her over the
phone so I actually was going to talk on
the phone with emily giffin at that time
I was living in a condo with the man who
is now my husband we were living in a
condo I believe we had like just
recently moved in there and I felt
really cool because in there we had it
was two bedrooms so we have our one
bedroom and the second
was kind of being used as like my
makeshift office and I had like a tiny
little desk in there and I would put my
laptop on it I felt like so cool like I
felt like I was like really doing big
things and I remember reading that and
running out into the living room and
being like I'm going to interview Emily
given i mean i was absolutely freaking
out i was fangirling all over the place
I couldn't believe it the day that I was
going to interview her over the phone my
husband was like you are making me
nervous because I was just pacing
everywhere I was so nervous I had a
notebook with all the questions that I
wanted to ask her written down my hands
were shaking i had like my palms were
sweating when I was talking to her i sat
on the bed and just like chatted on the
phone I mean it was the most like ah it
was the craziest thing of life luckily I
do want to say it wasn't just me
interviewing over the phone it was me
and I think two other gals or three
other gals and we were all book bloggers
so we were all on like this group call
with Emily and then like her agent or
publicist or whoever else it was was
kind of like running the show like okay
Samantha now us a question and I think
we all got to ask like four questions so
it was a pretty long interview but see
we talked to her about her movie and her
books but we also talked about the
Royals I think the royal wedding did it
happen that year and she was really into
the Royals so we were talking about will
and kate and it was just so crazy she
was so nice she was so friendly she was
so like forthcoming you know we'd ask
her a question and she would laugh with
us and it was it was just amazing and to
be recognized at that point in time as
like a bigger chiclet blogger to be able
to interview someone who's movie I mean
especially in the book community this
movie was like everyone was so excited
for because we love the books so much
just to be able to know that I was being
recognized as someone to be able to
intervene oh my gosh it just that is
such a highlight to me and something
that I will never forget whenever emily
has a new book come out I am lucky
enough to be on her PR list too so I do
get all of her new releases but every
time I go to open one of her books I'm
just like I talked to her on the phone
like I'm such such a fangirl
so then moment number four I mean I feel
like I had to include this in here but
it was becoming published one of these
days I'm gonna figure out how to like
turn my emotions off when I filmed these
YouTube videos because I feel like I get
emotional in so many videos but I had to
include this moment in here because it
was the reason why i started chiclet
plus it was my driving force behind it
was one day I'm going to publish a book
and it wasn't just you know in 2009 that
I wanted to be an author I wanted to
write books since I was nine years old
and it is duly documented in like my
little books that my mom put together
for us what do you want to be when you
grow up starting around the age of nine
I wanted to be an author you know
sometimes I said like actress and I
think one time was like a vet the times
in there was always offer so this has
been a childhood dream of mine and I got
this super small idea let's just start a
blog and see what happens and see if I
can make any connections and it turned
into me becoming a published author I
credit I credit not only chick lit plus
and obviously my work ethic and you know
things like that but seriously it's the
people that are you Chiclets Plus that
helped me so much this is where I found
my editors and my proofreaders and my
beta readers and just other authors that
I could ask questions to when I was
publishing my first book I had no idea
what was going on I didn't know what to
do I didn't know where to look for
people i didn't ohio to higher cover
designer and so many authors helped me
out and that is something i really do
try to remember i get a lot of emails or
messages from people saying like i know
you might be busy but I just have this
question and I'll I'll answer all of
them and a lot of times the responses
back or like you're so busy you didn't
have to respond to me right away like
it's okay but no that's never going to
be my mindset is I'm too busy to help
someone or I'm too good to help someone
or I have information that I don't want
to give to other people because if those
authors hadn't helped me in the
beginning I wouldn't have gotten to be
where I was so I just so so firmly
believe in keeping that circle going I
want to help us many other people as I
can I'm so happy to answer questions you
know I get questions now even about blog
tours how do you
start a blog to your company I will
answer those emails i will answer those
questions even though you know yeah sure
you're probably going to be a direct
competition to my business but yeah I
want to help you it and answer those
questions and now I'm getting a lot of
questions even about YouTube like what
camera do i use and all this stuff I
mean I know YouTube I don't even feel
like I'm a YouTube novice yet like I
feel like I'm even below that because
I'm so new but I respond to everyone and
just say you know this is what I do for
right now I'm just so happy and thankful
to give back because if people hadn't
given back to me it wouldn't be where I
was so I just I credit chiclet plus and
the wonderful beautiful friends and
people and connections that I've made
since starting it because you know this
literally chicklet pluses is where it
all started and I just feel so thankful
my fourth book just came out on july
twenty ninth and and it was literally
like Christmas morning when I woke up
that day and knew that I had a fourth
book out in the world like it's just is
still so mind-blowing to me tell people
I'm an author and they're like oh do you
have like a book out and on and I get to
be like no I have four were like ah for
can you believe this i can't believe it
you know I'm saying trying to rein it in
and then my fifth and final moment is
again like this isn't a specific moment
it's just much more broader than that
but it's honestly the relationships that
I have made with people with people who
follow my blog people who read my books
other bloggers everyone out there that I
have met or talked to or even just know
virtually since starting chiclet plus
that's such an amazing thing to me that
I feel like I have friends literally all
over the world some of them I've never
met some of them I probably never will
meet which really stinks but I have had
so many great moments in meeting those
people as well like i mentioned i am a
publisher with marching inc and my first
author that took a chance on me and let
me publish her book her name is kat
lavoie i met her in where did we first
meet Kat
that we first met at a book signing in
toronto in canada and i got to meet cat
and it was so like we just both cried
and it was just the coolest coolest
thing to be able to meet her but then
also at that book signing i met some
wonderful authors I remember the next
was at the next year we did a new york
signing and i got to me even more
authors and i got to me readers but i
got to meet there was a few readers
there at the new york event i feel like
in the canada event i was very like
quiet and shy and scared I was so
overwhelmed that was my very first book
signing book event ever I was in a
different country I was kind of scared
and quiet but New York I am a little bit
more familiar with New York I'd been
there before my husband was there
supporting me I'd already met a lot of
these authors from the Canada event I
just felt like more in my element I felt
more comfortable going around and
talking to people and things like that
but I was able to meet people that say
they know chiclet plus and they follow
chiclet plus and that was just so
overwhelming and so and so amazing and
just so beautiful it's it's so hard to
describe when something like that
happens to you because it's just so
profound it's such a touching moment
when that happens it's just it's just
incredible so I absolutely love the
connections and the friendships that
I've made i love that i can email a
virtual friend of mine when I'm having a
bad day and tell her about it and that
she'll respond to me and try to cheer me
up and that she can feel the same way
she can write to me when she's having a
bad day or a problem in her life and we
can try to help work it out with each
other and we live thousands and
thousands of miles away and we just
happened to meet online because we're
both passionate about books I mean how
absolutely incredible is that I know
sometimes the Internet can get you know
bad flak and especially social media and
just how vocal an opinionated we can all
be and how hurtful and you know bad
things can happen
that I totally understand it there's
going to be a downside to everything it
is that we do but I also think it's such
a beautiful thing because it is bringing
people together like nothing else can do
and I just think that is so amazing I
absolutely love it I'm so grateful for a
very small idea of starting a blog that
has led me to having a huge network of
friends and supporters and people who
cheer me on people who believe in me and
that's just I mean does it get any
better than that okay you guys those are
my top 5 moments in starting to gloat
plus i'm so sorry that like half the
video is going to be like my craft and
wobbly voice as I try not to burst into
tears because I just get so emotional
when I think about this but chiclet plus
and starting out in this industry is
just such a huge huge thing for me it's
something I'm so passionate about this
is my full-time job now this is what I
do day in and day out is what this is
what I do to be able to say that this is
my job I get to sit at home and write
books and read books and write articles
and make these videos for you guys and
do the product reviews and just to be
able to talk of make connections with
more and more of you every single day it
is so amazing I just feel like I need to
pinch myself every single moment knowing
that this is my life and it just it
solidifies it every single day that if
you really do feel passionate about
something to just giving it a try and
seeing where it goes it could lead to
crazy big things things that you never
even imagined you would be able to do
one day so here I go with my voice again
