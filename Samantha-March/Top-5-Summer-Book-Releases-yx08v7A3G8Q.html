back with my next top five Tuesday video
and it's going to be the top 5 summer
releases and I had such a hard time
picking five and i was asking on social
media you know what you guys are looking
forward to this summer and I was taking
your notes and my list at one point had
like twenty three books on it and I was
trying to cut it down as much as I could
and I was trying to take in your
opinions and I was looking on social
media and looking on amazon and looking
at book reviews and seeing what people
are excited for so I try to come up with
the best list that I could for you guys
let's just hop right into it first book
on the list is in the unlikely event and
this is by Judy Blume and honestly like
who doesn't love Judy Blume and so I was
really excited when I saw that she had a
new book come out placed on jun 2nd and
I've already been seeing so many people
on Instagram talking about this book
reading this book I've been seeing other
authors sharing pictures of the book and
sign that they were reading it and they
were really enjoying it so I really
wanted to include it for that reason I
do hope that I'll be able to read it
because it sounds really interesting and
one part of the blurb that i found
interesting is where it says against
this backdrop of actual events that
bloom experienced in the early 1950s so
that was really interesting to include
in the blur because my eyes kind of like
honed in on that right away and I was
like hmm but the book really sounds like
something that would be right on my a
leased line let the elevator blurb is in
her highly anticipated new novel Judy
Blume the New York Times number one
best-selling author of summer sisters in
a vm adult classics such as are you
there god it's me margaret creates a
richly textured and moving story of
three generations of family friends and
strangers who lives are profoundly
changed by unexpected events so sounds
like a great one if anyone has read it
yet or you're reading it now please a
comment below and let me know because I
would love to hear your thoughts on it
so the next one that I have is a little
bit different and a few people mentioned
dogs
media about this book and then I
actually saw featured in People magazine
so I was like okay I think I need to
take a little bit closer look at this
one but I guess it's just it's a very
highly anticipated book of the summer
because this one is primates of Park
Avenue and it's by Wednesday martin and
i think this one releases yeah this is
june second as well a memoir from
wednesday martin and says she has worked
as a writer and social researcher in new
york city for more than two decades
looks like she's the author of
stepmonster and primates of Park Avenue
she writes the online edition of
Psychology Today she's appeared on today
CNN and PR NBC News the BBC news hour
and Fox News as a parenting expert and
our work has appeared in The New York
Times so this book right now it already
has an Amazon best-selling rink and it
seems to all be in parenting sections
social studies women studies cultural
there's a lot of reviews already for the
book and they look to be pretty mixed
which honestly if you it I feel like
that's kind of to be expected with a
memoir especially someone if you have
like any sort of celebrity connections
or anything like that typically the
reviews are like very all over the place
but hearing like very recently hearing a
lot of chatter online about it again it
was a featured I believe it was on
people calm and People magazine so I
wanted to include that one in there as
well have you guys heard anything about
it also what do you guys been hearing
are you guys gonna read it I don't have
it on my list at all but i don't know
maybe if i hear enough about it i'll be
interested and want to check it out and
the next one that i want to talk about
is the book i'm actually reading at this
current time that i'm filming and it's
the neck off by lucy Sykes and Joe
Piazza and I actually think this one
came out in late May and so I was like I
don't know do I clued it in in summer
reads but I feel like I just had to
because there was so much buzz going
into this book around the summer time
and I don't know if you can see that but
I'm about halfway through the book i
started it
the day before I'm filming this and I've
already gotten halfway through it is
really funny it's really snappy it's a
really quick read so far I mean like I
said like I'm already halfway through
this book and I really just started it
and it is so far is a blast to read I
won't get into it too much because i
know that i'll do a review video on it
as well but i feel like it's very
chiclet there's a lot of fashion people
kind of compare the writing style
similar to the devil wears prada and I
think I I would agree with that but
really really good one so far if this is
a classic example of like a beach read
is the knockoff the next one that i have
is tiny little things and this is by
beatrice williams and we have featured
this author on chocolate plus like so
many times I've writer other reviewers
have read her and she seems to be just
such such a good writer a lot of her
books maybe all I'm not sure are more
like historical fiction and this one is
set in the summer of nineteen sixty-six
I absolutely love the cover it's just so
very classic looking and I believe we do
have this on the CLP review schedule I I
don't believe I'm the one doing they
review but one of our reviewers will be
reviewing that probably a little bit
closer to the publication date which is
june twenty third it is set in the
summer of nineteen sixty-six it says we
follow christina Hardcastle or tiny to
her illustrious family and she stands on
the brink of a breathtaking future so
again if you have this one coming up on
your reading list or you want to get it
on your reading list let me know and the
fifth and final one that I have is a
week at the lake and this is by Wendy
wax and again wendy is such like a
well-loved author on Chiclets plus i
have reviewed for her my other team of
reviewers have reviewed for her and I
feel like we all kind of get excited
when Wendy comes out she's an author who
we know that she has a book coming out I
actually have
all my reviewers email me like can I
review that one if it comes out so very
well-loved author on Chiclets plus and
she has a lot of books out there and
they are all really really good again
very good beach reads not quite as
Chiclets as maybe like the knockoff they
tend to be a little bit more you know
serious kind of in-depth books but
really good books paragraph on here says
20 years ago Emma Michaels Mackenzie
Hayes and Serena Stockton bonded over
their new york city dreams then each
summer they solidified the friendship by
spending one week at the lake together
solving their problems over bottles of
wine and gallons of ice cream they kept
the tradition for years until jealousy
lies and life disappointments made them
drift apart okay so that already sounds
great well just from reading that one
blurb I was totally hooked I I want to
say that I'm the one doing the review
but I could I could be wrong but I think
I am and I'm really excited because I've
given Wendy's books to other reviewers
the last few times so I think that's why
I was like okay I'm going to read this
one this time because I'm really excited
for it so you should see it come up in a
future review video only that video was
short and sweet I'm trying really hard
because i'm actually filming this at
night and the sun is going down i'm
gonna lose my light pretty soon but i
hope you enjoyed these top 5 summer
reads if you have any of them on your
reading list please do comment below and
let me know or if you have other books
that you're really excited to read this
summer please do let me know what they
are i know there was so many books that
i could have put in this video but i had
to only choose five which is really hard
and then i thought maybe i can choose
five but like do like an honorary three
and then I thought well no because every
time I do a top five Tuesday video it's
going to turn into like the top five
plus four more because I can't decide
like that so just limited to five so i
really hope you enjoyed this selection
and i will catch you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
