be doing a top 5 video and it's gonna be
my first one like this but again I've
been looking around other youtubers and
just kind of seeing what they're doing
and I see these like top 5 lists being
really popular I think they're mostly
uploaded on a Tuesday like top 5 Tuesday
so I'll try to put these up on Tuesdays
to go with the themes here but I have a
few ideas in mind of like top 5 lists
that I can do but if there's anything in
particular that you want to see whether
it be books or the beauty side of things
just let me know something on social
media and a lot of people are asking for
like the top 5 books of the summer that
are coming out and I think that's a
great idea and I've made my list and
I'll be recording that shortly any other
top fives that you want to see me do
please just comment below and let me
know and I will be sure to do that but
the first one that I'm going to do is
the top 5 chicklet blogs that I
recommend I'm starting to get asked this
question as I'm making more connections
on YouTube and people are saying that
I'm coming from the chiclet side of
things which I I'm not finding a lot of
other chiclet book tubers and like I'm
putting a shout out there if you're out
there on booktube or youtube and you
like Chiclets or you talk about Chiclets
or you know even contemporary anything
like that please let me know because I'd
love to find you I'm getting a lot of
questions being asked what other blogs
that I recommend because I'm coming from
the book blogging world my blog is
chiclet plus and it was started five
years ago so that's kind of where I'm
coming from
and now I'm crossing over into YouTube
but I'm having other youtubers and then
just other people in general that are
asking me what are some other blogs that
I could recommend to them and I thought
that was a really great idea and I'd
love to be able to give a shout out to
my friends because I consider everyone
on my top-five list a friend they're
people I mean I talked to these bloggers
like every day and one of them I even
have on staff
chat and we snapchat each other because
like these are my friends
so I'm really excited then I started to
get worried because I'm like I can only
pick five I know so many bloggers I love
so many people like how do I only pick
five so it took me a really long time
and I feel bad for everyone that I had
to leave out and I think this is just
going to be the worst part of these top
5 lists because I had to do the same
thing when I was I'm doing the top 5
summer releases I was like but there's
like 12 that I want to talk about but I
have to to 5 this part is gonna be so
hard but that's my little introduction
of what I'm doing with these top 5 lists
and just to jump right in to em the
first one that I want to talk about is
books etc it's books et Cie and I will
leave all of the links to all of the
blogs and the description box below so
you guys can go find the bloggers and
give them some love and tell them I sent
you and tell him I say hello and all
that fun stuff but books etc is run by
Kaylee and she's in Canada and Kaylee is
one who I really do consider like a
virtual best friend I have had the
opportunity to meet Kaylee which is so
awesome and I went to I had a like a
book signing event in Canada and Kaylee
actually came and picked me up from the
airport and let me stay at her house and
took me around Canada took me to a night
or falls and it was so so amazing and my
house is always open Kaylee if you ever
feel the urge to come to Iowa she's so
amazing we have each other at snapchat
she has a bunny and bunny is so funny
she's always sending me pictures of her
bunny and I'm sending her pictures of my
dog and sometimes sometimes we get some
bookish stuff in there too but I just
think she's such a great person and
she's so much fun and she loves books
and she loves reading and her reviews
that she posts on her blog I think are
so honest and that's what I love about
her because I know when I read a book
review from her she's completely honest
matter what outside factors there are
she's gonna give it to straight her
thoughts on the book and you know of
course we like the same type of books
and which is great because then you know
I want to read her reviews because I'm
interested and if there's books that she
really loves they go on my to read list
because I know how she loves it I'm
probably gonna love it she's also a beta
reader for me which is so amazing and
because I value her opinion so much and
I know how honest that she's going to be
that's what I need when I write a book
and no one else has seen it yet no one
else has touched it yet I send it to
what are called
my beta readers and they give me honest
feedback and let me know their thoughts
and let me know what works and doesn't
work for them and you need honesty you
don't need someone who's just gonna be
like oh yeah that was really good
because then I'm gonna put this book out
into the world and people are gonna be
like why no that wasn't good at all
so that went a little longer than I
thought it might be but I would
definitely recommend Kaylee over at
books etc I think she's amazing I think
her reviews are so good and you should
probably find her on social media too if
you like pictures of bunnies cuz her
bunny Tonks was really funny blog number
2 is going to be chiclet goddess and
this is run by Isabella and Isabella is
another beta reader for me which i think
is awesome she loves chiclet which i
think is great and her she does so much
for the chicklet community I think she
started a wonderful group called
chocolate goddesses and that's her blog
name if I didn't I already said that
right chicklet goddess she started this
wonderful community for people who love
chocolate and authors and we can get
together and talk about Chiclets and I
think that's so cool she is actually an
author as well she has written the book
of the right design and I will put a
link under her blog in the description
box below so you can go find the book if
he might be interested in it
but I've read the book and I think it's
a great book and I would definitely put
that on your to read this and I think
it's so cool to see
bloggers who have turned their blogging
career into something more and I just
think that's wonderful she is such a fan
of Chiclets she has such passion for
Chiclets and actually writes Chiclets
and I think that is so amazing so I
would definitely check out Chiclets got
us as well and the third one is Chiclets
central and this is run by Melissa and I
have actually met Melissa as well which
is so cool we met in New York I was
doing another like book signing book
event in New York and Melissa came and I
got a reader and I thought that was so
much fun I think there's a few like
administrators for Chiclets central but
I believe it was Melissa who kind of
like started it all got it all going and
I think Chiclets central is a great
block you know what focuses on Chiclets
it has book reviews it has you know
author interviews and it has like guest
posts from other authors which i think
is really good but they have a lot of
Giveaways too so if you were interested
in giveaways they often have giveaways
going on but I think they are so good at
starting discussions you know it whether
it be on the blog or on their social
media that's really like a place where
you can go and I feel like you can talk
about books or what you're reading or
you can get feedback on what's being
promoted on their website and I just
think that's so cool for people to be
able to have that outlet and you know
that's kind of like the beauty of social
media we can all kind of get together
and have discussions on certain topics
and you have that one central plan north
place to be able to do that so that's
what I really love about Chiclets
central and I know they've been around
for a long time they always have new
content going now fans of the genre big
fans of supporting authors which i think
is so amazing so they are one that I
highly recommend that you check out as
well and then the fourth one
and bubbly and it's run by Kayla who I
consider my friend of course consider
everyone friends but this one is not
solely buck focused you know
it's you know it's kind of like checkol
it plus you know we talk about books but
then we talk about beauty and other
things and Kayla she has a lot of book
reviews on there and she she does a lot
for authors but then she has like
product reviews and she talks about
beauty and she really likes fashion and
that's kind of you know when I started
Chiclets Plus Chiclets has kind of all
of those elements in their books too and
so that's where the name Chiclets plus
came from and I feel like Kayla does a
lot of that too I feel like her blog is
very Chiclets even though it's not just
focused on books I've just focused on
that genre she kind of has a lot of the
elements from what chick litters love in
there and so I love being able to read
her blog before that because I find it
so interesting that you know one day
she'll have a book review the next day
she'll have a product review and
sometimes I have found new products from
her reviews which i think is so cool so
that's one that I definitely recommend
too and Kayla is another fader reader of
mine I love my beta readers they
seriously saved me site now my fourth
book should be out this summer I
actually just got everything back from
my beta reader so I'm going through all
of it and they like seriously saved my
life like they are so they're so good
they're so they're so good they're so
honest they're so straightforward with
me they find small things you know like
half the time they're doing the work of
an editor like in one scene my character
is drinking the margarita and then like
two sentences later she's drinking a
diet coke and they're like I think all
of them are like oh we're the margarita
go and I'm like thank you to my lovely
betas I'm so happy I was able to include
when I first wrote the list out I didn't
even realize it and then I was planning
like maybe what I was gonna say for each
blog and I realized all through my
videos are in here so thank you fifth
and final blog is called the it's the
Jersey girl book reviews and this is run
by Kathleen and Kathleen I think
is such a supporter of books she loves
books and she loves reading and she has
so much content on her blog and she has
all sorts of Jean her features genres
featured it's like you go to her blog
and she will have I mean it's not every
day I don't think it's every day but a
lot of times you just has multiple post
growing up and you're able to find new
books from there and you're able to see
new genres and a lot of times she has
interviews going on - and her interviews
are so good and so in-depth it's just so
much fun to read about but you can tell
that she just has a passion for reading
she has a passion for books she's very
honest in her reviews - and I think her
reviews are so thoughtful and concise
and she really points out what she loves
and she points out what she doesn't love
and I feel like if you get a five star
from Kathleen like that's a true five
star if you get it from Kathleen so I I
love going to her blog she does so much
for authors and I run CLP block tours
she's an almost every single blog tour
that I run and we run a lot and I think
it's because you can just tell she has a
huge passion for reading ever books and
so that's what I think makes her blog so
great those are my top five chicklet
book blogs that I really hope you can
check out I love all these women I
consider them my friends I think their
blogs are great I think what they do in
the book blogging community is great and
for authors is just fantastic so if I
can only recommend five book bugs for
you to check out right now those are the
five it would be and I will have all the
links to their blogs below so you guys
