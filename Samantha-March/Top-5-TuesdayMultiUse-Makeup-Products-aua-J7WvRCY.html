today's video is going to be another
like top five Tuesday video and it's
going to be on multi use makeup products
so what I mean by that is i'm going to
be going through beauty products that
have one main purpose but can be also be
used for other purposes as well like
maybe like six or seven but i don't all
kind of go go through it because some i
don't use all the time some are like
special occasions so but i tried to keep
it pretty minimum trying to get as close
to five as i could but i will explain as
the video goes along but i just thought
it would be something kind of
interesting i haven't done a lot of top
five tuesday videos in the beauty part
of this channel I've mostly been doing
it for books so I was trying to think of
something beauty wise to do and for some
reason I thought of this I think it was
because when i was doing my five-minute
makeup i was also using my concealer as
a shadow primer so that's kind of what
gave me the idea but if you guys have
any other top five categories that you
want me to discuss for beauty whether i
don't know whatever it is if you guys
think of anything at all below let me
know if there's anything out there that
you would like me to record and if you
would like to see my multi-use beauty
products of police presence i already
mentioned them the first one that i want
to talk about is using a concealer as an
eyeshadow primer now i do this like all
the time these are my two favorites to
use one is the Maybelline instant age
rewind which I'm pretty much out of I
just mentioned in my empties video it's
I just need to throw it away I don't
know why I'm like holding on to it until
I buy a new one it's really sad but the
other one is the l'oreal true match
crayon corrector I like this one because
it's like pretty thick like I don't know
it's a pretty like thick consistency and
I just feel like it really does a good
job at priming the eyes I use the
instant age rewind when I'm doing makeup
looks where I don't do it a lot because
i usually will do my eyes first my eye
makeup first and then the rest of my
face but sometimes if i'm doing just
like a very
oh look like in my five minute makeup I
only had one eye shadow on my eyes so I
actually do my face first and then I put
the concealer all I do you know all
under my eyes but then I also do my eye
shadows all the way up to my eyebrows
and I think that works really well so
yeah this can be a huge time saver or if
you're traveling and you don't want to
take your eyeshadow primer as well you
can just take your concealer another one
I have to talk about is using
highlighters as your eyeshadows my two
favorite that I use sometimes as my
eyeshadows is the mary-lou manizer from
the bomb also from Becca cosmetics and
youtuber jaclyn hill is a champagne pop
i like using both of these this one is
more on the white highlight this one is
more on the champagne PG highlight but
they look so beautiful also on the
eyelids say you're going somewhere and
you can't bring a lot of makeup you know
but you want to make sure that you have
your hand a litter but of course you
want an eyeshadow I mean you can bring
these they can double it up both of them
are so pretty on the eyelids but the
opal is another one that I think is so
pretty so I've done that a lot if I'm in
a rush or I don't want to get one of my
palettes out or I just want to apply
something quick with my finger I I use
my finger to apply the highlighters on
my eyelid and I think it works out
really well then on the flip side you
can also use your eyeshadows as your
highlighters so to that I have that I
use this a lot use this trick a lot is
the L'Oreal Paris infallible I shadows
this one is an iced latte and then the
other one I use is the maybelline color
tattoo pure pigment this one is in
barely brazen so these are so simple
again I mean look how small these are so
if you want to use these you know you're
going somewhere you want to bring just a
few products you can use these you can
use them as your eyeshadow then you can
dip your finger or your brush in them
and applying this your highlight two
down your nose on your cheekbones
wherever it is that you want to apply
them and they work out really well their
trick that I like to use is
having a foundation be used as my
contour shade so i have this L'Oreal
True Match super blendable makeup and
classic tan and seven so that's what
this little bottle looks like so this is
a foundation but because it's so much
darker than my skin tone I use it when i
creamed contour most times i will use a
powder contour if i want to contour my
cheekbones but I also do like using
cream contours and I actually for some
reason like to do this in the winter I
feel like maybe it would be more popular
to do in the summer but in the winter I
find myself using this a lot and
basically what i do is i will just take
my contour brush a lot of times i use
like a small stipple brush from ELF and
I just dip it in the top and then I will
just use it to contour my cheekbones and
then blend it out and I feel like it
works really well so if you know maybe
you don't want to go out and buy a
contour kit because you don't contour
that much you can just grab a darker
shade of foundation and use it to
contour you can use it to bronze and
sometimes what I also like to use these
for is say I buy a foundation and it's
just too light for my skin I have done
that before I think shockingly enough no
one does that right yeah what I do is I
will pour a little bit of that
foundation into my hand and then I will
pour a little bit of this in there mix
it up and it's like I've made my own
shade and then you can match your
foundation really well so I have done
that before so there's a lot of really
good uses if you want to buy a darker
foundation but another one i have that i
have is using blush as an eyeshadow now
I don't do these last two that I'm going
to talk about I really don't do all that
often but i wanted to mention them
because i haven't done it before so this
is my elf blush palette and it isn't the
light they have a dark and the light has
a huge mirror so i feel like i'm not
going to be able to shield that whole
thing but it does have a bronzer shade
as well but then it has three pink
shades I don't use pink on my eyelids a
whole lot but sometimes I just want pink
in there are some times I'm doing
something fun like one time
did an 80s party and so I put like pink
and blue on my eyelids or years that I
like I've dressed up as barbie before
for Halloween and I use pink all over my
eyelids and so that's a really fun to do
but just because I'm not a pink person
on my eyelids doesn't mean you are maybe
you like big eye shadows I don't know
but then blushes a really good multi-use
product for that if you don't have a
certain pink that you love in your
eyeshadow collection take a look at your
blush collection and see if you have one
in there because they work just as well
on the ice last one I have to talk about
is kind of random but I have seen this
product mentioned a lot on youtubers I
found it from carli bybel when I started
watching her like last year she talked
about this so much that I went out and
bought it it is the brow bar to go and
it's by whitening lightning flash Gerard
cosmetics I still don't really know if
they're one company or the two companies
I don't know but basically it is a brow
bar for your eyebrows and it has a dark
shade a light shade and then like a gas
setting wax that you put over it and I
think I've mentioned on my channel that
I'm not really in the eyebrow game I
just recently bought the Maybelline brow
drama for my eyebrows but I have very
thick and full eyebrows anyways so I'm
not someone that really needs to like
paint on my eyebrows because they are
there but I bought this because i like
thought I could convince myself to get
in the Iraqi when I was first getting
into makeup it didn't really work out
for me but I have used this several
several times as eyeshadow especially
this dark shade right here I use that so
often in my crease I mean pretty often
just with a blending brush you just grab
that dark color put it in your crease
and then even the lighter shade
sometimes I will even just pick it up
with my finger and Pat it on my eyelids
there has been a time where I have gone
on a trip to Las Vegas and forgot all of
my eyeshadow palettes I forgot all my
eyeshadow palettes I mean I don't know
why I don't know what i was thinking i
think it was two years ago me my husband
went to vegas and celebrated our wedding
anniversary and i forgot my eyeshadow
palette but i had this
in here so had I have another l'oreal
infallible shadow it's called like
something diamond I can't think what
it's called as something diamond but I
had these two I'm a robar to go and
those are what i had to use as my
eyeshadows because I just forgot
everything but I used the bra more to go
quite a bit on this on that Las Vegas
Strip my shadows okay let's stop talking
about it that was a really sort but that
sucked again if you have you know
something that you use for your eyebrows
I mean you can put it in your lashes I
even see people who have like brown
mascara use it for their eyebrows did I
just say eyelashes i think i did but
brown mascara you can also use that as
like your gel wand Ziggy for your
eyebrows that's what I have from my
bowling and then vice versa you know
maybe you could use it on your eyelashes
too I don't really know how hygienic
that is because they say you know we're
not supposed to like SWAT mascaras and
all that stuff so i don't know if it's
just on yourself is it ok to use mascara
on your eyelashes on your eyebrows mmm I
don't know that one I have not tried
before but I have done the brow bar to
go a lot I think that is it for my top
five six seven whatever that was
