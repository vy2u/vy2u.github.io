today I'm going to be doing another top
5 Tuesday video and this one is going to
be on the top 5 chicklet series I
seriously I'm struggling so much with my
top 5 videos because it's so hard to
only come up with five and I had a huge
list the other night and then I asked on
social media your opinions and you know
what are your favorite series and then
all these other new series were coming
in that I had forgotten about and it was
really hard to narrow down to only five
I really tried to do some that I
personally loved some of that were voted
on a lot on social media some classics
some ones that maybe you haven't heard
of some chicklet mystery genres are
thrown in there as well because you know
I love mystery so much but these are the
five that I came up with if you notice
my nails I am filling this about 40
minutes before I have to leave my house
and head off to vacation for the fourth
of July we're going to a lake for the
long weekend to celebrate some bachelor
bachelorette parties for my very good
friend Ashley and so I just got done
fitting my nails now I'm filming this
video up and I have to finish packing
and head out the door so without further
ado the first series that I want to talk
about oh and please ignore my hair too
because like I'm in kind of the process
of starting to style it and then I
paused so I could film this video so
that by the time my husband gets home I
can be like finishing getting ready so
you can go with our trip and I'll hot
mess today but we're not gonna be back
until late on Sunday and this video
obviously need to go up on Tuesday
because it's a top 5 Tuesday video so
like we got to get on it anyways
whoa let's go first one I want to talk
about is the girlfriends series and this
is by the author Savannah page and I
mentioned Savannah page I think I
mentioned one of her books and like my
milestone tag video I think it was and I
made a comment like if I ever do the top
5 chiclet series like this is one that I
have to talk about because I love love
love love the series so much it starts
off with when girlfriends break hearts
is the first book and then there is 7
books total of
a group of girlfriends and each book is
from a different girlfriend's point of
view and so you get more details into
her life specifically but you always
learn about each new friend in the book
and I just I love reading books about
friends I love writing books about
friends I love my friend I mean it's
such a classic chiclet series I feel
like every single book I loved I am just
getting ready to read the last one in
the series which is when girlfriends
find love that is the last book the
seventh book and I'm going to be
starting that one very soon Savannah did
also just put out a standalone novel as
well and I will link that in the
description box below as well as all of
the girlfriends books if you love
chocolate you love reading about friends
and you love to follow a really good
series like when you get done with book
one you're like yes I want to read a
book too and then you get done with book
two and you're like but is book three
out yet all seven books are out so you
can read them I know she has I think
it's one through three are in a
collection on Amazon so you can purchase
books one through three all together if
you want to do it that way so really
good C really recommends so that is my
first chiclet series that i think you
should check out and the next one when I
said something on social media I swear I
mean this was like 90% of what people
were saying that they wanted to be
featured and that is confessions of a
shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella and of
course this one has to be featured
because this is like the cult classic of
chiclet I feel like I have read every
single one of the shopaholics books I've
seen the shopaholic movie you know the
shopaholic series I mean I feel like I
don't even have to say that much because
if you're a chiclet fan I'm sure you
could probably brought them Sophie
Kinsella is such a wonderful author not
only have I read all of her Shopaholic
series I've read all of her standalone
books as well I always get excited to
see she has a new book coming out and
she does on a fairly regular basis which
is amazing of course for the shopaholic
series the first one is confession
of a Shopaholic and then we go through
like we have Shopaholic and sister
Shopaholic and baby there was a short
story is the honeymoon one is the short
story and we I mean Hollywood we just
follow Becky's life and she has an
asterick Eric tur I remember starting
confessions of a shopaholic and like on
the first few pages as she's getting
like those bank notes and things like
that that you're just like yes this is
gonna be a really good time she feels
like she could be your friend
and again if you for some reason haven't
read any of these Shopaholic books like
please just go do it because yeah I
thought you'll really like them so just
go do it feel like my hair is like
getting weirder as this video goes on
the next one that I want to talk about
is the get it together samantha is the I
heart series and this is from Lindsay
calc and this was one I thought of right
away when I knew that I was gonna do a
chiclet series and I thought of this one
and then actually a few people did
respond on social media munching this
series so I was like oh perfect because
I really didn't want to talk about it I
have not read all of the books in the
series out of New York Hollywood and
Paris I think and there is five books so
there's New York Hollywood Paris Vegas
London how does that sound
that's I'm pretty good that might not be
a that could be in the right order cuz I
know those are the three that I've read
and then there's two more so these might
be for thought but so there is five
books in this series I have read the
first three of them I really liked
Lindsay's writing style again you know
all these books I'm talking about our
chiclet above that we get to follow
Angela to different cities to different
countries you know there's always
something new happening in each book but
then you also it's like you get to
travel along with her and then these
writing style really brings you into
those stories and you know I read a lot
of books of course and there are several
books that you know I'm just reading
them I'm reading the words and I'm I'm
reading with the characters and that's
all great but books that you actually
can get put
into the books with the characters I
think those are so amazing and
especially for me who I love traveling
so so much and it's absolutely something
that I love to do when I get to read
books about different places especially
places like Paris and London places that
I have not been to before those are just
they always turned out being some of my
favorite books so I had an absolutely
wonderful time reading these books if
you haven't read any and the I heart
series I really think that you should
and if you've read the last two please
do comment below and let me know if you
love them because I do have them on my
wish list to read in the future
okay and then the fourth series then I
want to talk about is the French twist
series and this is from Glynnis Asti and
please forgive me girlfriends I have no
idea if I'm saying your name right I'm
saying Glynnis and then I'm saying
Glynnis and I'm saying like both of my
head I'm like I don't I feel like
neither of those song right but we've
met before so this is like the worst
part that I'm like ha I just hate
pronouncing names on camera it's always
feeling I'm doing it wrong what it is
that's what you do but I need to show
you this cover again because I hope you
guys can see it I hope the glare isn't
like - hysterically bad because it
always s in these videos cuz I fell in
front of a huge window but look how
freaking cute that cover is and then it
only gets better because book two is
called french toast well look it up and
cover blue do you guys like it then
french fry is book 3 the absolute cutest
covers to buy solely based on the cover
like these would be it because I love
the covers so much I have read the twist
in the series and then I have yet to
read French toast and french fry but I
know that I really want to not only
because I consider the author a friend
and I feel so lucky to have met her we
met at a book signing in New York what
was that like two years ago I think
maybe it was and it was such a blast
such a good time to meet so many
different authors and readers and other
bloggers did tell me a little bit about
the book and it is on the Amazon page -
I was going to read the
/ - you guys after 13 years in the human
resources industry Glynnis was inspired
to create a work of fiction rather than
continue to the employees fabricated
complaints each day and her debut novel
French twist
she chronicles like seller dat courtship
and marriage to her husband Sebastian
with just a little judicious editing and
I love that because her husband was in
New York at the book signing and I met
him - and we talked about the book and
how she got inspired to write it and
what stories that she wanted to put in
there and all that good stuff and and I
have a package hole in the back the mail
lady came and dropped off the package
and I'm really glad because I was really
worried I was going to miss it today
since we were gonna be gone for the
entire weekend and I knew it was gonna
get delivered so I'm glad it's here
while I'm still home thumbs up David
talking about it I just get so excited
over I get so excited over ma'am
the French twist series and I really
really hope that you can check them out
as well get the fifth and final series
like I am throwing it way back and the
books that I'm gonna talk about is the
Molly Forrester novels from Cheryl J
Anderson the first one is killer heels
and when I say I'm throwing it real back
so I wanted to include a mystery series
in this video because I love chiclet
mysteries so much that I was like I need
to pick at least one series that is
mystery which one should I do I had so
many featured on chiclet plot I did not
know how to pick and I was going through
all of the pages like I have different
categories on chiclet plus if I want to
look at British chocolate or mystery or
historical or things like that I haven't
broken down into categories so I went to
the mystery category and was going
through the pages and I was writing down
I was like oh yes love that one Wendy
Linda Watson yes Terry Austin yes Susan
Boyer I love her - Dianne Valerie I was
like how am I gonna pick just one and
then I got to the very first page of my
mystery book reviews and I'm talking
from 2009 I wrote these reviews for the
Molly Forrester novels back in 2009
killer heels killer cocktail
killer riffs and killer deal there's
four and I believe I have that all right
probably not in the right order but
killer heels is the first one but I got
all of these books from my local library
once I started chiclet plus these were
some of the very first books that I
reviewed on CLP back when we started in
2009 getting them from my library
absolutely loved him I I wanted to
include this series because I felt like
it was what started my love of Chiclets
and mystery and I was able to combine
like two of my favorite genres and
mystery like really scary mystery
suspense horror thriller that stuff is
too scary for me
I watched the new Rihanna video music
video today for better have my money and
I'm terrified on plugging up nightmares
and that was like that was super creepy
and I didn't like that at all even
though I like to read a good mystery I
don't want to be super scared and not be
able to sleep at night so when you
combine it with something like Chiclets
it's just like the happiest of all
marriages and I absolutely love it and
can I just like okay this is we're just
gonna have to do this I'm sorry I'm
sorry I know I don't know what's better
or worse but smile was driving me crazy
this was the very first series that
really really got me interested in the
Chiclets in mystery and even though the
books are you know really old by now I
still can remember reading them and
remember how much fun I was having with
them so I just really wanted to include
those in this video so again is the
Molly force for novels from Cheryl J
Anderson and book one is killer heels
okay so I think I did it I don't know
how put this video is gonna be hopefully
it's not too bad I'm gonna try to get
these at least upload it and work on the
editing before I leave on my trip so I
can have these ready for you to go on
Tuesday morning I hope it's not late
both are five chiclet series that I just
think are so much fun that chiclet fans
would love to read I hope maybe you
found some new books I hope maybe you
saw some oldies that you're like yes I
love those books and if you have any
favorite series that I didn't mention or
did mention please comment below and let
me know what they are maybe
can learn about a few new ones because I
certainly was on social media when I
asked the question of you know which
books you wanted me to feature in this
video I was finding some new ones to
read myself I feel like I'm talking a
million miles a minute because I got the
go cuz vacation is starting I hope
everyone has had a wonderful 4th of July
weekend by the time you're watching this
video I hope you stayed safe and you had
fun and I gotta go bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
