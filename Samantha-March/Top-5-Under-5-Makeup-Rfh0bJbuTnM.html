video is going to be my top 5 makeup
products under five dollars so i got
this idea i got it like a while ago when
i first started youtube and i started
writing ideas down because i really had
no idea what to film and i had 505 like
ten under ten twenty under 20 that sort
of thing and i don't think i've done any
of those have I done any of them now I
have to look because I can't remember
but I don't think I've done any of them
just because I started actually getting
busy with better ideas or halls or you
guys have ideas that you were giving me
that I wanted to do so I've just never
been able to do it but I've actually
been seeing a lot of people doing it
suddenly I don't know what the deal is
but oh but I've been seeing a lot of 505
and so I thought hey that was on my list
from the beginning so why not do it and
then actually was kind of harder than I
thought I was going to be I was like
raiding my makeup bag i was looking
through all my cabinet some googling the
prices and it seems like everything i
found was like six or seven dollars i'm
like no and then I was thinking could I
say well this place always has a coupon
or you can always get a disc of no don't
do it stick with it but I did it and
then I actually have like a bonus 12 so
I actually ended up with like six so so
really it wasn't that hard i can stop
complaining at any time now but if you
would like to see my top five under five
please keep are they so before we start
a I feel like I'm like a million miles
away from the camera what what's
happening here but I want to say that I
just got a new color pop Holland I
mention it one of my last videos and I'm
saying how like I'm you know testing a
lot of different things bearing a lot of
different things so today I'm wearing it
their liquid lipstick in trap which love
it hard and I have two of their new gel
cream liners on my eyes I have maybe is
the green on top and then i also have a
pesto on my bottom waterline and i wore
best o in the last video i wore it on my
top upper lash line and absolutely loved
it
I don't love it on the bottom and mostly
because I didn't really notice this
until I was playing the playback of the
intro of the video and I was like it
kind of looks like my eyes are like
bloody or something I don't know it
kinda is kind of a creepy look because
beso is like a really deep burgundy and
I don't know just the way it like a
looked on camera I'm like I don't think
I like it on my bottom waterline my
upper lash line absolutely loved it
loved it so much today with the maybe on
top with the green since such a bright
pop of green I've gotten so many
compliments on it so far today and I'm
like okay Pat myself on the back so i
will have the whole color pop hull
coming up i'll do the haul and review
like I normally do so I'm just testing
everything out so you guys can let me
know what you think of the two colors
and also trap because I'm diggin trap
hard but anyways just to get that up
there I have a little eye shadow palette
and this is from Wet'n'Wild wet'n'wild
is a super affordable brand that you can
find at the drugstores this palette i
think was like three dollars three or
four dollars and it's called silent
treatment i actually did a video with it
i can link it up here even though i did
it in collaboration with a book release
that was actually called the silent
treatment actually did get sent this to
do a makeup look with it and to tie in
the whole video on the book release but
it is only like three dollars and i
thought it was really great it's really
good if you want a smoky eye but maybe
if you're new to make up which at the
time like I was super duper knew at the
time it was like in April hello like see
what your kind of scared and you get a
palette and you're like what am I
supposed to do with all those shades it
can be kind of overwhelming I thought
this one was really nice because oh
that's upside down well tells you right
on here where to put each of the shades
so there's a close up of all the shades
on there but it tells you you know the
lighter color goes on your brow bone and
where to put the crease color and then
where to put for like your actual eyelid
and I've done looks literally following
the Q's right here and I've also mixed
it up I've had
eyelid as my crease shade I've tried the
brow bone as my all over eyelid color
I've used the brow bone you know of
course it's my brow bone highlight but
I've used it as the inner corner
highlight I mean this is so good and
it's so small but it's not small like
you don't get a lot of product because
you still do get a lot of product i have
used this palette multiple times and I
feel like you can barely tell like maybe
in the eyelid shade you can kind of tell
but other than that like I mean it's
going to be a while before i go through
this bad boy and then I feel like if you
guys have been watching my channel for a
while you know that i love my Baline
like I love Maybelline something fierce
and I was trying to figure out which of
my products for under five dollars that
i could mention because i was like there
is no way i can film this video and not
mention anything from maybelline like
what what am I going to do so I was
going through all the products that i
have i was looking up all the prices and
honestly a lot of the things were like
six dollars and seven dollars and then
of course we have liked to ten and
eleven dollars as well but i did find
something um there maybelline the fit me
concealer is four dollars or right at
five dollars but it's in that i think it
was like 450 or something like that on
the target website and I was like yes
because this is one of my favorite
concealers I have the shape what 10
light one of my favorite concealers and
I mean Maybelline I own probably five or
six different Maybelline foundations I
have this concealer I have the
Maybelline incident a drink nope nope
rewind Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer I love it all and this for
only being 450 works so good I don't
know if you guys can tell like can you
guys see that it's starting like I'm
starting to get down there and i will
definitely repurchase this ok next i
wanted to talk about some tools and i
wanted to give a shout out to elf
cosmetics have three brushes from Alf
and i love them and i recommend them to
so many people I've used it a lot of my
videos and I just think they're great
but they are so affordable so this one
that has like the white handle it's a I
think they call it a smudge brush that's
not what I call this yeah smudge brush
but what I use it for is to put eyeliner
underneath my lower lash line or
sometimes if i'm doing a look we're like
i'm using black eyeshadow instead on my
upper lash line and i'm using eyeshadow
versus eyeliner and i want to smudge it
out then i will use this much brush to
do that but this is only a dollar hi 11
dollar and you can find out at drug
stores I they carry em they carry the
elf line at hyvee in my town which hi B
is our grocery store but they also have
a little beauty section and they carry
the elf brush is there yeah the ones
with the white handles are a dollar I
with it okay and then the brushes with
the black handles these are three
dollars so seriously I mean how much
better does that give sorry I feel like
the camera is so far away today so far
why did I do that but the two brushes
that I have are the small tapered brush
and then I also have the flawless
concealer brush now the small tapered
brush I use nearly every single day and
I use this to set my under eye concealer
so I use like a translation translucent
powder from Rimmel and I will just set
my under eye concealer and helps it from
you no creasing throughout the day and
staying and all that good stuff but this
brush it just works great for that and
it's three dollars you can get it at
Target what do you do the flawless
concealer brush I actually use this from
to apply my highlighter so I just dip it
in my highlighter and then I just apply
it to tops of my cheekbones and my nose
you know all that good stuff and I think
it works great I really didn't have i
use i do use a fan brush as well to
apply the highlighter but i feel like
this one just like gets more product on
there and that's where i wanted at if
that makes sense the only other way that
i use to put on highlighter is my finger
and then sometimes I
like I'm kind of like smudging myself up
and I'm getting fingers everywhere so I
really like to use this brush and again
three dollars okay and then I have a few
lip items to mention as well of course
the first one going back to wet'n'wild
this is the shade bear at all and that's
what that one looks like the wine and
wild lipsticks I believe are like two
dollars to 50 something like that I've I
picked up this one at my walgreens like
walgreens CVS I believe they have wet
and wild target at the other drug stores
and all that good stuff so i love how
affordable they are i bought bear at all
because i heard that it was a dupe for
max velvet teddy well I don't on max
velvet teddy i can't say that for sure
but like looking at the pictures and
looking at what it looks like on me I
say it's pretty darn similar it's just a
really pretty nude shade with a little
bit a little bit of an emphasis on it
it's not super nude but just enough
color that I think it looks really nice
i can wear it everyday i can wear it you
know to work i can wear it out to lunch
i love it the only things that I don't
love about it is like I don't I don't
love this what the packaging is got
going on like I don't like having to
roll it up and down because it doesn't
really work and if you guys can tell it
like I've done some serious damage to
the lid on there because I'll go to put
it in and I'll miss and I'll just just
gets everywhere when it's kind of messy
but for two dollars I mean you can't
really be mad okay and then my fifth
item is more lipsticks because why not
but these are from colour-pop cosmetics
and obviously I was just talking to you
guys about color pop but I absolutely
have come to love color pop I have
placed two or three orders with them now
and I'm just blown away but they are so
affordable which is just amazing and as
I was filming this video I look to see
what these gel eyeliners were because I
am already loving them so much and I've
only been testing them for like four
days and I'm already like yes the gel
eyeliners are only five dollars so i was
like technically i could put them in
here but i'm still trying them out you
know even though
right now my initial opinion is like yes
they're great they're fabulous I want to
keep trying them out door before I like
make a bold statement like that so I'm
just started out there that they are
five dollars the ultra matte liquid
lipsticks are six dollars still super
affordable and I love so many of the
ultra matte liquid lipsticks what ok I
have them somewhere hold on i'm starting
like my little collection and i believe
i still have some of my purse too but
what shades do i have let me just let me
let me tell you i have trap beeper what
should be limbo chilly chilly solo MIDI
and I thought I have bumble and bumble
so those are all of the ultra matte
liquid lipsticks that i have and i just
love them we'll keep on keep on place
and my orders for those because i just
think they're great but for this video
of what i wanted to really share with
you is there lippie Stix i have two of
the lippie Stix and these are five
dollars on the colour-pop website which
will be linked below of course but I got
these in my first order to try them and
I'm such I don't I don't know what I was
thinking when I went to go place my next
order I knew that the three liquid
lipsticks I really wanted beaver trap
and chilly chilly I knew I wanted those
and I knew I wanted to try out the jello
cream eyeliners and I just completely
forgot about lippie Stix and it was like
two days after i placed my order or
something and i was looking at the color
pop website and i was like no i forgot
lippie Stix and I was so upset with
myself so next time I placed an order I
already have like I think four different
shades of libby sticks that I want to
get but duh but so for right now I have
to and I just think so cute first of all
I think the packaging is adorable I love
all the clerk pop packaging i think it
is so awesome but this first color is
westie and it's just a really pretty
like light pink shade and then the other
one i have is cookie and i actually used
cookie in my latest makeup tutorial I
believe the cool tone cat eye I used to
cooking in that one because it's just a
beaut
fo like brown nude and they are just
they're so easy to apply they stay on so
long i believe at these both matt yes so
these are both Matt's so they're not
they're not like the liquid lipstick but
they do dry Matt and I feel like that
helps them stay on so long and like I
mentioned in the makeup tutorial like I
part of the reason i chose cookie for
that one is because i was going for like
a longer lasting makeup and I feel like
that one just stays on so well so both
of these shades I absolutely adore I
think the packaging is great I think
they stay on great there are five
dollars I mean does it get any better
than that so yes color pop in general
but also the lippie Stix they're great
okay and then as my bonus item because
everything that I had was from like a
drug store that you can easily get it
you know the targets of the walgreens
are the CVS and then I threw clutter pop
in there because i love that brand so
much right now and i really want you
guys to know about them but then also
just in case anyone was like well I
don't want to order online or I like to
go to the store whatever I do have just
a few more olympians to talk to you
about and of course they're from
Maybelline but they are the Maybelline
Baby Lips now I have two three right
here because these we're just sitting on
my desk but i think i have three more in
my purse because these are so great if
you just want a quick like they're
almost like a chapstick but kind of like
a lip gloss like you can get them in
different shades and let's see what this
one says purple one is one of my
favorites because it's just like a
really um it's just like a really sheer
nude and i don't even know do these have
like names i think they have names but
they're not anywhere on the packaging
they're on the actual like the box that
you take them off on i think their names
are on there but they've come out with
different lines of them like this one is
pretty pink and it leaves and leaves
just like a little bit of a pink tinge
on your lips i have a red one that makes
your lips a little bit red but it's not
like lipstick you're not putting on
lipstick it's more for chapstick and for
me it's like if I'm just running around
running errands I don't want to put
lipstick on I don't
when I have to worry about reapplying
lipstick etc etc I just shoot swipe
these on and I love them I'm kind of
obsessed with them my best friend is
obsessed with them for her birthday I
literally bought how many did I buy I
bought her like eight or ten or
something maybe about ten and I put him
in like a big old base for her like her
lip gloss holder she really loves lip
gloss but I bought her a bunch of those
because she loves him too and I believe
they're like three dollars so if you
guys really like chapsticks like lip
glosses you just want a little cheap
option to be able to throw in your purse
the Maybelline Baby Lips everyone loves
them I feel ok so those were all my top
five on five and makeup products i hope
