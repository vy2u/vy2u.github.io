so I'm very excited for today's video
because not only is it a video about
spring makeup also excited that were in
the spring ish it's kind of cold here in
Iowa today and I said like there's even
a chance of some snow in the forecast
this weekend seriously but spring is
coming so we're getting excited about
spring lugs I've been obsessed with
watching spring makeup tutorials like
obsessed as I feel like that's like all
I'm watching these days and getting me
excited and the inspiration but I'm also
excited for today's video because it is
another collaboration video and this is
a collab with que Bella beauty her name
is Kelly here on YouTube we connect it
via YouTube and Instagram the regular
old thing and I was so excited when she
reached out and asked if i wanted to
collab with her and of course i said yes
because I just I love doing
collaborations I think I've only done
like two or something so far but each
time they're just so much fun they make
me kind of like even put more effort
into my videos maybe then I would on a
regular basis because I feel like
someone's counting on me to do a really
good job too but it also is like you're
forming like you're forming a friendship
but then you're forming like an even
better friendship because the girls that
have collaborated with like I'm always
seeing what they're up to it I'm
connecting with them more than I think I
would anyone else like always watching
the snapchats and just commenting for
them commenting to them things like that
so I just I love doing the club's I've
been having so much fun with them so
again collab with que Bella beauty but
what we are doing is we are sharing our
top spring lipsticks one of our favorite
things to talk about am i right
lipsticks I'm a huge loopy lover if you
guys don't know I don't think I've ever
said this here in YouTube it was
probably like last month I started on
Instagram a hashtag it's just hashtag
purse lippy Monday if you share a
picture of like your favorite lipsticks
what you've been wearing that week if
you share it on instagram with the
hashtag and you tag follow me on
instagram I'm March bucks beauty and
take two friends in your photo for every
photo that you enter you can do one a
week I put all those names into a
drawing and I draw one out at the end of
them
month and send a winner a lipstick so
last month was the first month that I
did it and the winner was liz williams
who's here on youtube as well that
was pretty cool and i sent her namaste
from the TARDIS lip paint so I don't
know kind of fun if you're a big
lipstick Glover I suggest you check it
out if you are over on Instagram because
yeah I draw a winner every single month
you just need to share a photo so pretty
simple but anyways we all love lipsticks
now we're getting into spring I did like
my top fall lipsticks back in the day
and I feel like that video went over
very well and people like seeing it and
we're just excited you know changing of
the season changing up the trend like
three different shade groups to talk to
you about basically it's like light pink
nude and then bright colors so that's
what I narrowed my choices down to I
tried to do three in each category the
new tech for because I like nudes but I
actually started out with like 27
lipsticks or something and I was like
you can't you gotta narrow this down
like just because they are good look for
spring or think what is my favorites for
spring what am I constantly grabbing it
was a narrow down a little bit more so
i'll be sharing my favorite lipsticks
also make sure to go check out Kelly's
channel i will leave her video in her
channel link down below and her
instagram information she has a great
channel she does things like reviews and
first impressions and halls all that
sort of good stuff that we love so make
sure to go check her video out let her
know that i sent you give her some love
and yeah if you would like to see a my
top lip stick pics for spring please
keep watching first up shade family-wise
i'm going to talk about is pinks and i
have just become like crazy attracted to
light pink whether it be on my lips are
on my eyes today i went with light pink
on my eyes and so i went with the nude
lip but no matter like if I'm not doing
Pink's on my eyes I'm doing Pink's on my
lip I just have been loving it one of my
favorite light pink lip sticks and it
has been since i bought it is from
Gerard cosmetics it is called buttercup
Intel like I really I've loved on this
but it's just a beautiful light
pink shade I mean it's like a baby pink
lipstick and I just I wear it so much
that's what it looks like on my hand I
never know like where when I'm actually
showing you guys anything but I just
think it is so so beautiful so this is
better cut from drug cosmetics this was
a collab with jaclyn hill and it was
basically like the reason i bought all
of the dried lipsticks that Jaclyn hill
came out with and I know she's not
affiliate with Gerard anymore but I
believe you can still buy all of the
colors that she did on there it just
doesn't have like her name or her
picture next to them anymore but I
believe they are all still for sale on
the website so this should still be on
there but I'm obsessed with it I wear it
so much i bought it last summer if you
can tell like I wear it a lot this is
probably like my most like worn lipstick
I don't know if I've ever gotten a
lipstick down that far but yeah
buttercup from Gerard cosmetics the ones
that I have are from colour-pop one is
one that i bought in like my first order
with them and it is sallow this is one
of their ultra matte liquid lipsticks
the sallow is just a great like basic
paint there's a swatch that so it's just
a really good like solid pink color like
if you want some pink pink on your lips
you Sal oh I use it a lot it was one of
my favorite ones that i ordered i also
really like midi and sometimes i'll mix
the two together I love putting midi on
top of my lips but I don't wear it alone
a lot so that's why I did mention it in
this video but salo was a good choice
then the other one I have from
colour-pop is clueless I got this in my
most recent order and I actually thought
it was going to be very very similar to
sell oh I mean it's it's similar but
they're definitely different so I was
pretty happy about that but clueless is
another like I mean it's a pink but it's
kind of like a dusty rose dusty mauve
color and it is gorgeous like I wearing
this so much like what I want to do a
liquid lip thats pink I'm reaching for
clueless and it's just beautiful I'm so
happy with it I kind of bought it based
off of its name because I love them
we clueless but the first time I put it
on I was like yep this is such just a
great everyday pink color the next a
family color that I'm going to talk
about is nudes and i just love nudes
like you can't go wrong with nudes right
and I feel like I've mentioned both of
these lipsticks in like favorites videos
but two of the lipsticks are from
Maybelline one is from there Matt line
and it is called clay crush so this is
what this one looks like it's a leg
deeper nude if that makes any sense this
is a matte lipstick from maybelline to a
duster i'm at on the lips and it is nude
but it's got like a little bit of an
oomph to it it's gorgeous I wear it all
the time the other one i have from
maybelline is called truffle tease and i
feel like i've just like raved about
this in so many different places but it
is just a really nice basic nude shade
here it is right there just like a
really nice nude when I first got it I
thought maybe it was going to be too
sheer um but like if I just put it on
like two or three times and some which
might seem like a lot of layers but it
doesn't feel that way on the lips but
when you build up the color it just
gives you like a really sheer brown nude
and I think it is gorgeous so that one
is truffle tease the two others that i
have is actually what i'm wearing on my
lips right now it is a color combination
that i do so often but first what I'll
do is I'll come in with a lippy stick
from colour-pop this is another one that
I got in like my very first order with
color pop this is called cookie and it's
just a beautiful brown nude shade again
it's what i'm wearing on my lips right
now kind of reminds me a little bit of
clay crush but maybe a little bit more
on like the sheer nude side and this one
is cookie from color poppin is one of
their matte finishes so it will dry
matte on the lips and then I come in and
I put on a NYX soft matte lip cream on
top of it and this shade is in London
and like the colors are so like pretty
similar London is just a little bit
deeper but it gives a really nice matte
finish to it and I feel like the soft
matte lip creams kind of help keep the
formula on longer than the colour-pop
one would
so that's why I put it on on top of it
and I just feel like it gives it a
little extra a little extra dimension
and a little more like staying power so
that's why I like to mix these two up
but yeah that's what i have on my lips
right now i first went in with cookie
from colour-pop and then London from
Nick and the last ones i have to talk
about our pops of color and I feel like
pops of color are going to be very very
popular for spring like you can't go
wrong with nudes and you can't go wrong
with like baby Pink's but like pops of
color or what makes spring and summer so
exciting i'm working on adding some more
into my collection because i did
actually have quite a few and i'll go
into like what I'm not talking about
more but it's just that they're not my
favorite like formulas of the ones that
i do have so i'm trying to get more into
my collection that I actually really do
want to wear if that makes sense but I
know everyone's different for spring
like I just don't feel like the brown or
the deep lips are like spring ish but I
mean hey everyone's got their own ideas
from what's bring us these are just my
ideas and my topics the first 1i have is
another NYX soft matte lip cream and
this is in the shade milan i bought this
thinking it would be more unlike a very
light pink maybe even like the dusty
shade no it is the right pink so when
i'm feeling bold like i feel like i can
put this one on but i like I need to
make sure that I'm feeling bold like you
guys see that one like that is a bold
bold pink right there but I really do
like the soft matte lip creams I
actually bought one for the Knicks that
I don't like it it's more the color that
I don't like and I felt like I had to
work so hard to build it up it's in the
shade Rome I think I've talked about it
in a hall and it's like this London and
Milan I absolutely adore Rome for some
reason was a Miss for me and I know
wrong came out later than these guys so
I don't know something changed the
formula change I don't know what
happened but didn't love that one but
these two for the next soft matte lip
creams I love so one that I wanted to
mention is from Too Faced it's not their
melted lipsticks and I actually own two
more of these and i just don't really
love the formula of these
I love this color so much this is in
melted jelly donut I love this color
it's so bright and it's so glossy and it
looks so good on the lips but within
like 10 minutes of me wearing it it's
like bleeding a lot and it's like all
over my face and it's on my teeth like I
just don't feel very confident wearing
this I can wear it in pictures I can
wear it in a video that I'm going to
talk for ten minutes but to actually
like wear it out especially anywhere
that I'm going to be eating or drinking
like I just don't feel comfortable doing
that which really bums me out but this
color I love this color so much and I
see so many people that love the two
face melted lipsticks so I wanted to
mention it because if you're a fan of
the melted lipsticks melted jelly
doughnut is such a cute color but for me
the formula is just a Miss so i actually
have other really bright colors from
this line and i first had pulled them
out and then I was like you know i just
i don't like this formula i don't like
it for myself so I don't want to sit up
here and recommend three lipsticks when
I don't firmly believe that so the only
reason why I'm really mentioning this
one is a I think the color is so
freaking bomb but be I know a lot of
people love these so I just wanted to
mention if you're if you do and you
really like like you're looking for a
new color melted jelly doughnut is such
a cute cute color so this is it right
there on the top of my hand that is
melted jelly donut like it is a bright
electric pink and I just it's such a
pretty color I wish it like stayed
better on my lips I don't know how to
make it like we only had liked Astra fee
I finished filming all of my favorite
lip colors and swatching the mall and I
camera run to turn my camera off and it
wasn't recording and I was like you have
got to be kidding me I just SAT here for
20 minutes and swatched all over my
hands did that not record but it did and
then my memory just was full so it cut
off right as I was going to talk about
the very last lipstick thankfully cuz I
was like I don't know if I have it in me
to film this today i'm dogsitting so not
only do i have my dog but i have a big
German Shepherd here today and they're
playing but they keep like coming up to
the door and whining to get in I tried
to have them in here with me when i
first started recording sales like maybe
they'll just lay down
no they immediately came in knocked into
my tripod and my camera fell out I'm
like okay you gotta go outside but I
feel like you can keep hearing them so
if you hear any weird noises it's the
dogs but I was like there's no way I can
refill this and like I said it's the
club so I don't really have like a whole
lot of time to edit I'm really really
really glad it was just the last one
that it cut off on but my very last
lipstick that I was talking about is
from Tarte and it is from their TARDIS
lip paints these are fairly new from
Tarte and I ordered one a couple months
back the shade was in TBT which is like
the really pretty mom shade and I loved
it these formulas I feel like are either
love hate because they are they're kind
of similar to like the NYX soft matte
lip creams like in field that's how I
feel that they go on but also I feel
like the big downfall with them is that
they say that their liquid lipsticks but
they don't dry down completely how most
liquid lipsticks are completely dry on
your lips they are transfer proof and
they're not going to go anywhere these
do not dry down totally and I think that
was maybe a little bit misleading when
these came out because people are
putting them on and then like you know
kissing their hands or taking a drink or
something and their lipstick was
transferring it doesn't really come off
your lips honestly but it does transfer
so I don't know I feel like a lot of
people get mad about that but what I
find good about that aspect is that they
are more comfortable to wear on the lips
they don't you know like when you put on
the liquid lipstick and some of them can
be a very very dry formula and they can
kind of do that cake keeping on your
lips that's not very attractive these
don't do that and when they do start to
wear off you can actually very easily
reapply these whereas with like the more
traditional liquid lipstick you can't
really reapply them because then it just
like dunks up even more and you
basically have to remove your entire
lipstick and start over so I mean I
think there's pros and cons to each it
just depends on what you like and what
you want to wear like some days I want
to wear I liquid lipstick and I know
that my lipsticks not going to go
anywhere some days I want a really
comfortable lip to wear but with a bomb
color and then
the TARDIS lip paints because so far the
two colors that I've got have been very
pigmented and I've loved both colors and
I really like the formula and I'm gonna
probably pick up even more so the shade
that I got is in so fetch and of course
I've already swatched this for you but
it is this pink shade right here and I
just think this color is like bomb for
spring and that is why I bought it
because when I was going through the
website I knew I wanted to buy one and i
was buying a few other things from Tarte
too but I was like I want to pick up
another one of the lip paint i was
reading through all the descriptions and
watching swatch videos on youtube and i
saw this one and it's like a neon coral
pink and i was like if that doesn't
sound perfect for spring like i don't
know what does and i love it I ward in
my skincare routine video and shared a
few photos on Instagram and everyone was
like that lip color that lip color that
lip color what does that lip color that
lip colors bomb I was so fetch from
Tarte it's beautiful it just makes me
think spring and I love it for this
