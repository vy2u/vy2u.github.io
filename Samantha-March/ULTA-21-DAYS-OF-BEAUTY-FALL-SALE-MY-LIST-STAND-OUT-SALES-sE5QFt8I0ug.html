so excited for today's video because
it's going to be all about in the
ultimate 21 days of beauty event we're
just starting today if you are watching
me at the day of posis which is Sunday
September 3rd I have done this video I
think maybe the last three times that
Ulta has been running their 21 days a
beauty event and it seems to go over
really well and I've been getting so
many requests to do another one so
that's what we're gonna be doing today
we're gonna be talking all about the
Ulta 21 days of beauty I'm going to be
running through a few of the items that
they're gonna be having on sale letting
you know what I would recommend also
letting you know what I am planning on
picking up before the sale for myself so
if you would like to see my
recommendations and kind of my wishlist
as well for the Ulta 21 days of beauty
event starting today why don't I go
ahead and get started so if you are not
familiar with all the 21 days of beauty
basically it is a makeup sale for 21
days at Ulta Beauty each day there is
specific items or brands that are on
sale and each day is a different sale
there's a calendar on alte 21 days of
beauty it's not a surprise it's not wake
up and see what's on sale they list
everything out for you so you can get a
good handle on what you want to pick up
from the sale which i think is amazing
I will have it linked down below to the
Ulta website where you see the calendar
of everything that is on sale the sales
are just for one day only and they do
sell out they are available both in
store and online but if there's
something that you know you really want
i suggest either getting to your store
early or ordering it online because the
deals will run out after that day that
deal is over then we move on to the next
day also included in the Ulta 21 days of
beauty is what is called hot buys I will
run through some of the hot buys as well
those are available the entire time
during the 21 day sale not like specific
days or anything for that but those also
do sell out so if there's something you
want it as a hot buy I suggest getting
it early if you are a platinum member
with Ulta your hot buys do ship free so
even if you buy something that's only
ten dollars it will ship free if you are
a platinum member so let's kind of just
all the 21 days and beauty event in a
nutshell so it is running from today
Sunday September 3rd and then the last
day will be Saturday September 23rd
which is my half birthday so if anybody
wants to send me anything on that day
I'm open to it also leave everything
that
mentioned specifically linked in the
description box down below so for the
first day which is Sunday September 3rd
I am kind of curious about a cosmetics
brow power super skinny
it's a eyebrow pencil it's regularly $24
gonna be on sale for 50% off which is
only $12 I really been trying to switch
up my brow routine I kind of have always
used the same products and I think it's
because I was always you know just
learning brows and once I found
something that worked for me I really
stuck with it but I've been trying to
experiment and try different brands and
you know different types of products I
definitely think pencils are easiest for
me so that's why I'm kind of curious
about this one and I don't have a ton
from a cosmetics so I'm kind of curious
to maybe try it out and twelve dollars
is not a bad price I just bought the
anasazi brow as it was 21 so I have my
eye on that one I might do it for only
$12 to be able to try something new I
might have to go ahead and give it a
shot on Tuesday September 5th I noticed
the Mario Badescu enzyme cleansing gel
is gonna be 50% off it's only $14 it's
gonna be on sale for seven I have a
couple of items from Mario Badescu and
I've always really enjoyed the line and
I've always typically recommended it so
I don't think I'm interested for me
because I actually have a ton of
skincare right now I just took a big
donation actually of skincare that I
haven't used are opened
I don't need it for myself but I do like
Mario Badescu if you're looking for a
new cleanser or a new skincare brand to
try they are pretty affordable anyways
but then to have 50% off for a cleanser
had only $7 I don't think that's a bad
price at all and then I also noticed the
pier all of their primers are going to
be a 50% off
it says regularly 33 and they're gonna
be on sale for 1651 nation on the
picture is the no filter primer I like
that primer it does kind of remind me a
bit of the becca like back light priming
filter but i like the pure one even
better the becca one i just really I
don't know we didn't mesh the bus but I
do like the Pier one to make my face
shiny but it just makes it more glowy I
would say I do like that primer so if
you're looking for a new primer you can
maybe check that one out at 50% off and
Wednesday September 6 the first day
Beauty this is going to be online only
they're ready set hydrate kit is going
to be 50% off it's regularly $44 it's
going to be on sale for 20
two dollars looks like you get five
different items I'm assuming they're all
mini since they are in a set first day
Beauty is one of my favorite skincare
brands I own a ton from them I've bought
a lot from them and I really do enjoy
buying their sets that is how I first
found first a beauty I bought a set from
them I highly recommend first aid beauty
especially if you have sensitive skin if
you're looking to restock maybe see if
one of you favorite items is included in
this set or if you just want to try out
for safe Beauty buying a set and then
buying it for the 50% off I think that
could be a good deal Thanks September
8th had definitely caught my attention
so first the Urban Decay Naked flushed
palette is gonna be 50% off regularly
$34 it's gonna be on sale for 17 looks
like there is a blush a bronzer and then
I'm assuming that it's a highlight shade
the packaging caught my attention I
think this looks really pretty I don't
feel like I've heard a lot about the
naked flushed palette but I am super
into these types of palettes that have
multiple different uses in there so that
one kind of caught my attention I'm not
sure I would pick it out for myself just
because I have a lot of those types of
items in my collection but it was one
that caught my eye so I kind of flagged
it for myself but the other thing that
got me really excited is that Oprah this
is gonna be online only because as of
right now Oprah is only on line at Ulta
sorry if you hear my dog barking ups
manage this game but select highlighters
are going to be 50% off so it's there
regularly between 29 and $32 they're
gonna be on sale for 1452 $16 that has
me very excited because I continually
hear great things about Oprah
highlighters I've had my eye on them for
a very long time but I haven't done it
mostly because I've been on a highlight
no Buy and I broke it
thanks to Alda actually and there are 10
times points day that they're having for
platinum appreciation day I bought the
Wet n Wild precious petals highlighter
which is what I have on today and
because I did it now I've been eyeing
other highlighters like I just I just
picked that one up too right I just pick
it up I once you break your know by is
broken it's broken so I have my eye on
it I'm not gonna lie it does say select
highlighters so I'll have to see what
exactly like when I click on it it
doesn't take me there yet because the
sale hasn't started but that one has
my attention we will see but I wanted to
point out to you guys as well because I
know a lot of people love those over
highlighters and I am also eyeing them
number nine I feel like has some really
good deals that Saturday the philosophy
micro delivery exfoliating a facial wash
it's gonna be 50% off twenty eight
dollars it's gonna be on sale for
fourteen I don't try a lot of philosophy
myself but I get it recommend it to me
all the time I always see other people
talking about the brand we wanted to
pass it along because I know a lot of
people like it so the benefit roller
lash lifting mascara it's gonna be 50%
off its regularly $24 it's gonna be on
sale for 12 so one of my favorite
mascaras I just pulled it out over the
weekend and wore I'd IR repurchase that
mascara so many times and then another
one that I'm interested in this is gonna
be another online-only it's from cover
FX it's their perfect setting powder
regularly $35 it's gonna be on sale for
1750 so it's gonna be 50% off I feel
like I had just heard someone talking
about the setting powder for some reason
that one caught my attention I don't
know for sure if I would need it for
myself 50% off of course is a great sale
especially for something like a setting
powder which I don't use a ton so it's
better if I can get something on sale
that I don't use on a consistent basis
but I still like to have around but if
you love setting powders this could be a
good one to check out and I'm gonna keep
that one flagged for myself and we'll
see if I get it on a Sunday September
10th one thing that caught my attention
this is gonna be online only as well for
NARS the narcissus cheek studio palette
looks like it has different I think it's
bronzers blush and highlight shades in
there as well it's gonna be 50% off so
regularly $55 on sale for twenty seven
fifty so I don't think that is bad oh
this is going to be a platinum perk
sorry I just saw that little platinum
perk over there that one cuz I actually
got so many tags on that one to put it
in a will I buy in video but other items
kept beating it out so I know a lot of
people were interested about that one on
Thursday September 14th of the Urban
Decay Naked skin color correcting fluids
are 50% off regularly $29 on sale for
1450 and we are interested in these sort
of items I know a lot of people really
do enjoy color correcting I personally
am NOT one of them I don't do color
correcting a ton but if you are that
could be a good time it to snag
something like that especially if you
like color correcting but you don't do
it
a regular basis to be able to get
something at half off could be nice the
one that got me most excited on that day
is from LeBrock this is gonna be online
only their tantalizing buildable
bronzing powder is 50% off regularly $32
on sale for 16 I actually have my eye on
this one for a while and I don't know
why I love bronzers I just bought a new
bronzer from Sigma like I don't need to
know their bronzer but I'm like 50% off
hmm
so I have that one flag for myself just
because I've been interested in it for a
while so I'm fighting to be picking up
that lorac bronzer but that one caught
my attention Saturday September 16th
looks like a pretty good day it brushes
for Ulta their airbrush complexion brush
the number 115 it's gonna be 50% off
regularly $24 on sale for 12 I know a
lot of people swear by these brushes and
absolutely love them I've always had it
in my plans to buy one but I've never
done it maybe this will be the day maybe
not because I just did a brush to
clutter
maybe not also the benefit brow service
you get a free brow wax with any $50
benefit purchase and that's a $21 value
so if you're buying anything from
benefit in the store and you also want
to get a brow rocks that could be an
idea excites me the most is that dose of
colors they're matte liquid lipsticks
are 50% off this might be the thing I'm
most excited about in itself because I'm
picking me up some lipsticks they're
regularly $18 they're gonna be on sale
for nine dollars and I'm like yes I am
actually wearing one right now it is
from the new their new mint collection
it is in mint tea I featured it in my
latest haul I also have their ideal duo
the mint one on my eyes as well you'll
love the dose of colors or liquid
lipsticks the formula of this one I also
have stone and I love it I have so many
more on my list and so many more like
loved or on my wish list or whatever all
plus super stoked about that only nine
dollars for a liquid lipstick that I
think is like a top notch liquid
lipstick you definitely gotta mark your
calendar for that one I am stoked about
that Saturday September 16th dose of
colors is only available online only
I'll turn right now so that's an online
deal only on Sunday September 17th the
Becca under-eye brightening corrector is
going to be 50
than off regularly $30.00 gonna be on
sale for 15 I feel like this one for
myself because I heard a lot of really
good things about it I don't know if I
need it I think there's like like almost
like a salmon peachy color to kind of
help color correct under the eyes as
well and like I said I don't color card
for me a lot but I've seen a lot of
people use this in tutorials and it
seems like people like it I've had a
friend go through a complete bottle of
it or like a completely little jar of it
so I've always kind of wondered about it
so for 50% off I'm like it might be
something that I might go for if any of
you guys have tried it and you think it
would be good to pick up at 50% off let
us know so on Wednesday at the 20th
Clinique is gonna have their take the
day off makeup remover on sale for 50%
off regularly 19 on sale for 9.50 I've
heard a lot of really good things about
that and makeup remover is something
that I go through a ton because of
course I use it on almost a daily basis
so I flagged that one for myself but I
thought I would pass it along also and
then also on that day Mac there Russian
red and velvet teddy lipsticks are gonna
be 50% off regularly 1750 on sale for
875 haven't read Russian red but I do
love Belva teddy I continually still
reach for that one and I think it is
really nice if so only 875 it's a
regular lipstick but I think it's really
nice I do like the color so I thought
that was interesting as well but I
believe it's just those two colors for a
Mac that will be on sale that day now
Friday September 22nd the Thar Dias lash
paint mascara from Tarte cosmetics it's
gonna be 50% off regularly $23 on sale
for 10 I haven't tried this myself
personally I don't think I would pick it
up because I'm also in like mascara
overload right now but I've heard a lot
of people mention it I see it used quite
a bit in tutorials so I did want to pass
that one along also from Dermalogica
their daily super folium is going to be
50% off regularly $18 on sale for nine
is this at least once a week if not
twice a week it's one of my favorites I
think I've almost gone through my entire
first bottle of it and I do have another
bottle on standby because it's one of my
favorites it's a really cool exfoliator
it's actually a powder and you mix it
with water and apply it to your face and
I just I really do like it
I use it
every single week the final day of the
sale which is Saturday at September 23rd
the benefit cobra is going to be on sale
for 50% off regularly 24 it's gonna be
$12 on that day go from Mario Badescu of
the vitamin C serum is gonna be 50% off
regularly $45 gonna be on sale for 2250
I love vitamin C I use vitamin C all the
time I think it's awesome for your
skincare routine so I wanted to point
that one out and then also butter LONDON
they're glazing eye gloss is going to be
50% off regularly $24 gonna be on sale
for 12 I believe this is what I hear a
lot of people like go crazy over and
they get really excited for these I've
never tried them myself but I think I'm
saying it correctly that a lot of people
really like these from butter LONDON so
wanted to point that out but that's
everything that I wanted to share during
the actual 21 days of beauty and
breaking down each of the days but I did
also want to touch on the hop eyes
because I thought there was some really
interesting ones in here so from Tarte
they're double duty Beauty empowered
hybrid gel foundation well it is
regularly $39 it's gonna be on sale for
$27 I'm curious about this I love
foundation I hear a lot of good things
about this one I've never really
gravitated towards towards it because
it's like in a jar and I don't know for
some reason that just kind of like
weirds me out but it is gonna be on sale
so it might be a good time to give it a
try it's really excited to see from
Benefit Cosmetics their hoola cream to
powder quicky contour stick is gonna be
on sale it's regularly $28 it's gonna be
on sale for $21 so a couple dollars
cheaper but how you just find all the
time I really do love it I use it more
as a bronzer versus a contour cuz it's
kind of warm but I do really enjoy that
notice the lorac alter-ego collection is
going to be 40% off that's their
lipstick lip gloss lip stains and lip
liners from bareMinerals
they're gen nude matte liquid lip color
regularly $19 it's gonna be 13 I'm
thinking about picking one up because
I've heard of amazing things about these
lipsticks from bareMinerals and they've
kind of been on my list for a while to
check out so $13 not a bad price
Smashbox is gonna have their travel
primers regularly $16 they're going to
be on sale for 10 so if you want to get
little primers I did notice their primer
water is included in that I picked that
up as a
hop buy in a regular-size during the
last up to 21 days of beauty and I still
really enjoy it so there's that the
Urban Decay Naked smoky is going to be
50% off regularly 54 is gonna be on sale
for 27 I own that one
I think it's decent it's not my favorite
palette in the world but I do think it's
nice and to get it half off is not bad
especially for those naked palettes
because those are expensive I was really
excited to see this this is when I feel
like for myself the peer eye polishes
are going to be 40% off so regularly 26
on sale for 1560 these I'm super curious
about I've seen a lot of people using
them and I'm interested in they're kind
of actually remind me of the ideal duo's
like the one I have on my eyes right now
from dose of colors so I might pick one
up myself because I have been eyeing
them for a while but those are some of
the hop eyes that caught my attention
either for myself or that I wanted to
pass along so don't forget about the hop
eyes because there's usually some good
deals in there too a lot of times these
do go fast so make sure if you do want
something that you get it
okay so that's gonna be everything for
my Ulta 21 days of beauty of
recommendations and kind of wish list
video I would love to know what you guys
are excited to pick up in the sale what
caught your attention the most mine I
think was the dose of colors like what
lipsticks that made me so excited I have
to say that I kind of was a little not
as excited for this sale as I remember
being for the last one I actually
purchased multiple days last year I got
quite a few of the hot buys as well I
just thought like I was most excited or
not even last year I think it was like
in March I'm pretty sure I just remember
being more pumped for that one are still
you know a few good items in here and
some that got me pretty excited so
notice what it is it's a makeup sale and
anytime you get to save money on makeup
that is a nice thing but let us know
some comments down below what you were
planning to pick up from the sale if you
didn't enjoy this video I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys
real soon in my next one bye
