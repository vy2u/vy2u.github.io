really excited for today's video because
it's going to be all about the Ulta 21
days of a beauty so the also 21 days of
beauty event kicks off today sunday
marks 19 and I'm going to go through the
calendar of all the deals with you let
you know what excited me the most to
work out my attention what I'm thinking
of purchasing what I think maybe might
be good for you to purchase I'm also
going to talk about their half eyes and
I'm just really excited to bring this
video to you I did this for the last
awful 21 days of beauty event I believe
it's an event that happened two times a
year I'm pretty sure and I got really
good feedback on it and then recently
after the the event was announced I have
been getting asked questions as I'm
doing another video and not really meant
a lot to me that you guys remember that
I did the video and you liked it so much
that you wanted to see another one thank
you so much for everyone who's been
asking me if I was going to do another
video so I'm really excited to share
this with you I am going to try to get
through it as fast as i can because
there's a lot of different days and
deals to talk about and I know I make
longer videos I try so hard to make them
short but I just love talking to you
guys I love making these videos so
that's why I talk a lot I also apologize
if I seem kind of like sassy today I'm
filming this on Wednesday March
fifteenth which is doing these days for
my fifth novel so it's a really busy
crazy exciting wonderful day for me and
I still wanted to try to film a video
because i am taking a vacation next week
so i'm trying to film as much as I can
but i have my book right here I've
talked about it in a couple of my past
videos but this is my fifth novel it's
called defining her and it's on sale
today was the days i'm filming mar 15 so
it's on sale so I'm just having a really
busy day promoting it and talking to
readers and watching the reviews come in
and saying thank you want social media
and all that good stuff so I'll leave
the links down below in case you are
interested in picking up your copy of
defining her the e-book is only 299 and
I'm also doing a giveaway for a fifty
dollar gift card if you're interested in
entering that giveaway I will have that
linked down below as well but I'm just
really excited about it so i'm going to
have one a wild and wacky day so I
apologize if I just seem crazier than
normal for the altar 21 days of beauty
like I said I believe that happens two
times a year so it's starting today
19 and it goes through saturday april
eighth and what it is each day there is
a daily deal it is for that day only so
you can either purchase online some of
these products are going to be online
only I will try to point those out as
I'm talking about them some are online
only some you can buy in the store but
it is going to be only for that day I
think it's really cool because Alta
gives us the full calendar which i think
is really helpful you can plan on what
days you want to buy online you can plan
what days you want to go to a store if
you want to visit the store I think
that's really fantastic then they also
have what are called hot buys and
there's some hot bias and I'm really
excited about really excited about and
excited for you guys about and neither
deals that will happen during the entire
event so you can get these at any time
items can go out of stock usually the
daily deals I don't see him run out of
stock too much unless it's like a really
hot item but if there's something that
you really really want I definitely
suggest getting it as quick as you can
same things with the half eyes because
they are over the full 21 days they can
run out of stock I've seen it happen I
don't it's not like super common we're
like you know a makeup product launches
and within two minutes of out of stock
I've never seen that with all the 21
days of beauty but things can run on
stock so make sure you keep that in mind
another thing with also 21 days of
beauty some of the items are going to be
for platinum members only again if I'm
talking about those in this video I try
to point out this is a platinum perk but
another good thing to keep in mind if
you are a platinum member at Alta the
beauty deals will ship free for you so
if they're the day and all you want is
something that's like 10 bucks you just
want that one item you don't have to
spend the fifty dollars to get the free
shipping that item will ship for you for
free and that is just for the Platinum
members and it's just for the beauty
steel so you can't just like pick
anything else out of the store it has to
be that day of that beauty's deal that
makes sense I'll try to leave it all of
that link in the description box down
below and what I recommend for the sale
look at the calendar pick out what it is
that you want and then kind of make your
game plan from there if you're not a
platinum member I suggest looking at the
calendar and seeing what it is that you
want and seeing if there's any hot buys
so the day that you
to buy something if you can add in a
half I and then anything else that you
need to restock or something else that
you've had your eye on try to get it all
on that one day so you can hit that
fifty dollars for the free shipping if
that's something important to you that's
something that's important to me that's
kind of how I would go about it but I
just think it's really cool that we get
the calendar kind of time we can kind of
plan it out I think that's really
helpful so I will leave a link down
below to the calendar of events I'm not
going to go through each day because
that would take too long like i said i'm
just going to highlight and pinpoint a
few items that i'm most excited about
but i'll leave a link to the full
calendar down below I'll also leave
everything listed that I talked about
and linked in the description box down
below and one more thing if you do
purchase online make sure to use ebates
because you can get cash back I always
have my ebay playing it down below
because I think it's super important get
cash back it's super easy so if you're
doing this online make sure you do that
because you can save even more money I
think that's going to be everything but
I wanted to explain with all the 21 days
of beauty is and kind of give my tips
and tricks for shopping the event but if
you want to see the beauty steals and
half eyes let's go ahead and hop into it
so to kick it off on Sunday March 19 I
thought it was really cool because the
two-faced love flush blushes they're
going to be fifty percent off which is
amazing they're regularly $26 they will
be just thirteen dollars on Sundays
today also the philosophy micro delivery
exfoliating wash will be fifty percent
off regularly $28 it will be on sale for
fourteen dollars and then this is going
to be a platinum perk it's the eight
brushes for all tied you can get the
complexion perfection of central three
piece brush set for fifty percent off
regularly it's forty nine dollars going
to be on sale for 2450 I am interested
in all three of these quite honestly I
hear nothing but really good things
about the two-faced love / blushes like
I hear great things so for thirteen
dollars for a really big blush I think
that's a great deal up here so much
about philosophy but I've never tried
them myself so to try them at fifty
percent off seems like a great idea and
then I feel like I'm always hearing
coffee break with Danny talk about the
it brushes for alta and how great they
are so again to get three brushes and
one is like a big brush and you guys
know if you saw last video was I talking
about my love for big brushes
might have been my most recent makeup
all I said I like big makeup brushes and
I cannot lie there's like one really big
fat russian the air and I'm like I see
you and it looks like it also comes with
like a traveling case which is really
cool so I mean kicking it off in a big
way Santa is a 19th I feel like those
are all really fantastic things so
that's pretty exciting moving on to
monday at March twentieth what I am most
interested on this day is to Fiona
styles sheer sculpting palette it's
going to be fifty percent off so
regularly $28 it's going to be on sale
for fourteen dollars I am super into
contouring and bronzing and just being
able to sculpt the face I'm super
interested in that right now I keep
buying cream browsers and contouring
policy that is like what I'm super
interested in right now and I'm hearing
really good things about Fiona styled
I've not tried anything from that brand
but it is definitely on my radar so to
be able to try it again for fifty
percent off I think that's a really good
steel so that's definitely what's got me
interested for Monday be night catches
my eye on Tuesday March 21st is the
juice beauty stem cellular anti-wrinkle
moisturizer it's going to be fifty
percent off this one says it is online
only regularly $68 and it's going to be
on sale for 34 I hear good things about
the juice beauty the stem cellular line
is like what it seems like everybody
really loves that one I have tried to
sue T in the password and try anything
from that particular line I wasn't super
thrilled with it but everyone came back
in my videos like on snapchat and they
were like the stem cellular line is
where's that I'm like okay I clearly
messed up so I don't know i think most
risers i like anti-wrinkle almost my
birthday 30 30 so i don't that one's
going to be curious that that one is on
Tuesday of March 21st on Wednesday March
twenty second i'm sorry i'm going to try
to go as fast as i can and no my videos
are usually pretty long and we've got a
lot skitters i'm going to try to keep
the speedy for you guys but on Wednesday
of march twenty seconds the buxom
full-on whipped cream are fifty percent
off there regularly twenty dollars
they're going to be on sale for ten
dollars it does say it excludes limited
edition shades I recently just got the
buxom full on the cream in the shade
White Russian it came in my Sephora give
me some lift set and
I really enjoyed it I really liked it
kind of gives like that slumping feeling
I was super into it and I highly enjoyed
it so I don't know i'm curious about
maybe getting another one at only ten
dollars like that doesn't seem that bad
so that was got me interested on Sunday
March 26 the best of backlight priming
filter is going to be fifty percent off
its regularly $38 it's going to be on
sale for 19 I do own this and I like it
it's not my favorite primer and it can
leave me a little bit too doing a little
bit too luminous like I can't match it
with a luminous foundation at all or
glowy foundation anything like that I
cannot match those two together because
then I just kind of look super oily and
I'm not an oily person I remember really
liking it in the summer and I would wear
it like just by itself especially when I
had like a nice pan going I would wear
just that I know a lot of people seem to
like it if you've been wanting to try it
out try it out for fifty percent off i
think that seems like a pretty darn good
deal and then also the Urban Decay after
glow blush this is going to be a
platinum prints for that day and online
only but they are fifty percent off
regularly there are twenty-six dollars
they'll be on sale for thirteen dollars

hmm I'm namitha Friday March 31st the
Smashbox photo finish primer water is

$32 is going to be on sale for sixteen
dollars I might take this up because I

though I kind of struggled to buy into
the mic though they really do anything
does it really work but so many people
love it and talk about it and rebuy it
and I see it in MPs and I'm like to get
it for sixteen dollars I think that's
going to be a good time to try it out on
Saturday April first
cosmetics your skin the better CC and
airbrush perfecting powder is going to
be fifty percent off its regularly $35
it's going to be on sale for 1750 I just
got the CC cream like the squeeze tube
it's actually what i have on my face
today and I really liked it I don't know

hear really good things about the it
cosmetics CC creams and powders and all
that good stuff so that interesting and
then also on the same day Saturday April
first Mario Badescu the entire brand is
going to be twenty five percent off
which is awesome I have the rose water
spray and i love it and i know the line
just came out with a new spray i think
it's like a cucumber type of spray some
curious about that too so might have to

secondly excited about this this is
going to be a platinum perk so for
platinum members only but the lorac
unzipped palette or on fifth gold
palette will be fifty percent off it is
online only it's regularly $42 is going
to be on sale for 21 so i just recently
got the lorac i love brunch palette and
i did a video about it i can be linked
down below and i got so many comments
saying like because it's a pastel
palette it's a very light palette I like
the palette I'm not like mad at it and I
don't feel like I gave it a like a bad
review but so many comments were coming
in like don't go to Little Rock on this
palette and get the lorac unzipped
palette or the unzipped gold outlook I
kept seeing those comments so to see
that they're going to be fifty percent
off this might be a good time for me to
buy that Lavrov palette so would you
guys recommend the unzipped or the
unzipped gold Palace let me know it does
interesting on Tuesday April fourth from
pure cosmetics therefore and one pressed
mineral powder foundation regularly 2950
it's going to be on sale for eighteen
dollars I talked about this powder so
much I've talked about it in my ride or
die I testified and my most repurchase
makeup I love this stuff I use it all
the time I've gone through so many been
wearing it since college I personally
don't need a backup because I just got a
backup not that long ago but if you guys
want to try it out I'm telling you it's
a really really good powder and you can
get for a little bit cheaper so on
thursday april six there's going to be
another item from juice beauty and
another one from their stem cellular
line this is the anti-wrinkle booster
serum it's going to be fifty percent off
its regularly $78 and it's going to
on sale for 39 I'm I have to think about
that one on a Friday April seventh from
Tarte the Amazonian clay blush and
highlighter are going to be fifty
percent off regularly 28 on sale for 14
this is another one I hear such good
things about the tart blushes and I
don't own any so to try them out at
fifty percent off i think that's going
to be a good way to go and then the last
day of the sale which is saturday april
eighth the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow
with pencils are going to be fifty
percent off regularly $21 they'll be on
sale for 1050 but I know everybody likes
Diana Southey umbrellas pencil I don't
know if I would pick one up for myself
because I have a hard enough time doing
bros over those but maybe it'd be a good
time to get it a little bit cheaper
since I probably won't know how to use
it but hey if you're a big fan of the
bro is it's gonna be on sale and also
the benefit brow service you get a free
brow wax with any fifty-dollar benefit
purchase at the $21 value I believe if
you buy something online on that date
like if you were to get fifty dollars
worth of budgets of products on that day
so i'll send you a coupon to use in
store i'm pretty sure is how that works
but that's the whole calendar not the

like what really excited me to talk
about in this video but that's the 21
