really excited for today's video because
it's going to be all about the Ulta
21 days of a beauty so the Optus 21 days
of beauty event kicks off today Sunday
March 19th and I'm going to go through
the calendar of all the deals with you
let you know what excited me the most
what got my attention what I'm thinking
of purchasing what I think maybe might
be good for you to purchase I'm also
going to talk about their Hot Buys and
I'm just really excited to bring this
video to you I did this for the last
alpha 21 days a beauty event I believe
it's an event that happens two times a
year I'm pretty sure and I got really
good feedback on it and then recently
after the the event was announced I've
been getting asked questions if I'm
doing another video and that really
meant a lot to me that you guys remember
that I did the video and you liked it so
much that you wanted to see another one
thank you so much for everyone who's
been asking me if I was going to do
another video so I'm really excited to
share this with you I am gonna try to
get through it as fast as I can because
there's a lot of different days and
deals to talk about and I know I make
longer videos I try so hard to make them
short but I just love talking to you
guys I love making these videos so
that's why I talk a lot
I also apologize if I seem kind of like
spazzy today I'm filming this on
Wednesday March 15th which is they
release day for my fifth novel so it's a
really busy crazy exciting wonderful day
for me and I still wanted to try to film
a video because I am taking a vacation
next week so I'm trying to film as much
as I can but I have my book right here
I've talked about it in a couple of my
past videos but this is my fifth novel
it's called defining her and it's on
sale today with the day that I'm filming
March 15th so it's on sale so I'm just
having a really busy day promoting it
and talking to readers and watching the
reviews come in and just saying thank
you on social media and all that good
stuff so I'll leave the links down below
in case you are interested in picking up
your copy of defining her the e-book is
only $2.99 and I'm also doing a giveaway
for a $50 gift card if you're interested
in entering that giveaway I will have
that linked down below as well but I'm
just I'm really excited about it so I'm
kind of having a wild and wacky day so I
apologize if I just seem crazier than
normal for the author 21 days of beauty
like I said I believe that happens two
times a year so it's starting today
Sunday
2:19 and it goes through Saturday April
8th and what it is each day there is a
daily deal it is for that day only so
you can either purchase online some of
these products are going to be online
only I will try to point those out as
I'm talking about them some are online
only some you can buy in the store but
it is going to be only for that day but
I think it's really cool because Ulta
gives us the full calendar which i think
is really helpful you can plan with days
you want to buy online you can plan what
days you want to go to a store if you
want to visit the store I think that's
really fantastic and then they also have
what are called hot buys and there's
some hot buys that I'm really excited
about really excited about and excited
for you guys about and these are deals
that will happen during the entire event
so you can get these at any time items
can go out of stock usually the daily
deals I don't see him run out of stock
too much unless it's like a really hot
item but if there's something that you
really really want I definitely suggest
getting it as quick as you can
same things with the hop eyes because
they are over the full 21 days they can
run out of stock I've seen it happen I
don't it's not like super common where
like you know a makeup product launches
and within 15 minutes of out of stock
I've never seen that with all the 21
days of beauty but things can run on a
stock so make sure you keep that in mind
another thing with the Ulta 21 days of
beauty some of the items are going to be
for platinum members only again if I'm
talking about those in this video I try
to point out this is a platinum perk but
another good thing to keep in mind if
you are a platinum member at Ulta the
beauty deals will ship free for you so
if there's a day and all you want is
something that's like 10 bucks you just
want that one item you don't have to
spend the $50 to get the free shipping
that item will ship for you for free and
that is just for the Platinum members
and it's just for the beauty steal so
you can't just like pick anything else
out of the store it has to be that day
at that beauty's deal that makes sense
I'll try to leave all of that linked in
the description box down below only what
I recommend for this sale look at the
calendar pick out what it is that you
want and then kind of make your game
plan from there if you're not a platinum
member I suggest looking at the calendar
and seeing what it is that you want and
seeing if there's any Hot Buys so the
day that you
to buy something if you can add in a hop
I and then anything else that you need
to restock or something else that you
had your eye on try to get it all on
that one day so you can hit that $50 for
the free shipping if that's something
important to you that's something that's
important to me that's kind of how I
would go about it but I just think it's
really cool that we get the calendar of
ahead of time we can kind of plan it out
I think that's really helpful so I will
leave a link down below to the calendar
of events I'm not going to go through
each day because that would take too
long like I said I'm just going to
highlight and pinpoint a few items that
I'm most excited about but I'll leave a
link to the full calendar down below
I'll also leave everything listed that I
talked about and linked in the
description box down below and one more
thing if you do purchase online make
sure to use Ebates because you can get
cash back I always have my Ebates link
down below because I think it's
super-important get cash back it's super
easy so if you're doing this online make
sure you do that because you can save
even more money I think that's gonna be
everything but I wanted to explain with
Ulta 21 days of beauty is and kind of
give my tips and tricks for shopping the
event but if you want to see the beauty
steals and hat buys let's go ahead and
hop into it so to kick it off on Sunday
March 19th I thought it was really cool
because the Too Faced love flush blushes
they're gonna be 50% off which is
amazing they're regularly $26 they will
be just $13 on Sunday today also the
philosophy micro delivery exfoliating
wash will be 50% off regularly $28
it'll be on sale for $14 and then this
is going to be a platinum perk it's the
8 brushes for Ulta you can get the
complexion perfection essentials 3-piece
brush set for 50% off regularly it's $49
it's gonna be on sale for 2450 I am
interested in all three of these quite
honestly I hear nothing but really good
things about the Too Faced love flush of
blushes like I hear great things so for
$13 for a really big blush I think
that's a great deal here's so much about
philosophy but I've never tried them
myself so to try them at 50% off seems
like a great idea and then I feel like
I'm always hearing coffee break with
Danny talk about the it brushes for Ulta
and how great they are so again to get
three brushes and one is like a big
brush and you guys know if you saw what
video was I talking about my love for
big brushes and
might have been my most recent makeup
all I said I like big makeup brushes and
I cannot lie there's like one really big
fat brush in there and I'm like I see
you and it looks like it also comes with
like a traveling case which is really
cool so I mean kicking it off in a big
way so no to the 19th I feel like those
are all really fantastic things so
that's pretty exciting
moving on to Monday March 20th what I am
most interested on this day is the Fiona
Styles sheer sculpting palette it's
gonna be 50% off it's regularly $28 it's
gonna be on sale for $14
I am super into contouring and bronzing
and just being able to sculpt the face
I'm super interested in that right now I
keep buying cream bronzers and
contouring palette like that is like
what I'm super interested in right now
and I'm hearing really good things about
Fiona styles I've not tried anything
from that brand but is definitely on my
radar so to be able to try it again for
50% off I think that's a really good
steal so that's definitely was got me
interested for Monday V night catches my
eye on Tuesday March 21st is the juice
beauty stem cellular anti-wrinkle
moisturizer it's gonna be 50% off this
one says it is online only regularly $68
and it's going to be on sale for 34 I
hear good things about the juice beauty
the stem cellular line is like what it
seems like everybody that really loves
that one
I have tried Juice Beauty in the past
but I didn't try anything from that
particular line I wasn't super thrilled
with it but everyone came back in my
videos and like on snapchat and they
were like the stem cellular line is
where it's at I'm like okay I clearly
messed up so I don't know I like
moisturizers I like anti-wrinkle it's
almost my birthday dirty 30
so I don't that one's gonna be curious
that that one is on Tuesday of March
21st on Wednesday March 22nd I'm sorry
I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can I
know my videos are usually pretty long
and we've got a lot to get through so
I'm gonna try to like keep it speedy for
you guys but on Wednesday a March 22nd
the buxom full-on lip creams are 50% off
they're regularly $20 they're gonna be
on sale for $10 it does say it excludes
limited edition shades I recently just
got the buxom full-on lip cream in the
shade of white Russian it came in my
Sephora give me some lip set and
I really enjoyed it I really liked it it
kind of gives like that plumping feeling
I was super into it and I highly enjoyed
it so I don't know I'm curious about
maybe getting another one at only $10
like that doesn't seem that bad so that
one's got me interested on Sunday March
26 the Becca backlight priming filter is
gonna be 50% off its regularly $38 it's
gonna be on sale for 19 I do own this
and I like it it's not my favorite
primer and it can leave me a little bit
too dewy a little bit too luminous like
I can't match it with a luminous
foundation at all or glowy foundation
anything like that I cannot match those
two together because then I just kind of
look super oily and I'm not an oily
person but I remember really liking it
in the summer and I would wear it like
just by itself especially when I had
like a nice tan going I would wear just
that I know a lot of people seem to like
it if you've been wanting to try it out
try it out for 50% off I think that
seems like a pretty darn good deal and
then also the Urban Decay afterglow
blush this is going to be a platinum
perk for that day and online only but
they are 50% off regularly there are $26
they'll be on sale for $13
I hear really good things about these I
actually purchased this in the last of
the 21 days of beauty for my upcoming
giveaway which is coming this week stay
tuned keep it rollin on Tuesday March
28th that's my little brother's birthday
the Tarte man-eater self sharpening
liner is 50% off regularly $20 is going
to be on sale for 10
I like tarts liners and I think I might
go for this I really like eyeliners so
$10 for a chart eyeliner I'm like hmm
I'm not mad at that
Friday March 31st the Smashbox photo
finish primer water is going to be 50%
off regularly $32 it's gonna be on sale
for sixteen dollars I might pick this up
because I hear so many people talk about
it even though I've kind of struggled to
buy it because I'm like doesn't really
do anything doesn't really work but so
many people love it and talk about it
and rebuy it and I see it in empties and
I'm like to get it for $16 I think
that's gonna be a good time to try it
out on
Saturday April 1st the a Cosmetics your
skin but better CC and airbrush
perfecting powder is gonna be 50% off
it's regularly $35 it's gonna be on sale
for 1750 I just got the CC cream like
the squeeze 2 but actually what I have
on my face today and I really liked it I
don't know maybe the powder would be
good too but I hear really good things
about the cosmetics CC creams and
powders and all that good stuff so
that's interesting and then also on the
same day Saturday April 1st Mario
Badescu the entire brand is gonna be 25%
off which is awesome I have the rose
water spray and I love it and I know the
line just came out with a new spray I
think it's like a cucumber type of spray
some curious about that too so my hats
pick that up as well
Sunday April secondly excited about this
this is gonna be a platinum perk so for
platinum members only
but the lorac unzipped palette or
unzipped gold palette will be 50% off it
is online only its regularly $42 it's
gonna be on sale for 21 so I just
recently got the lorac I love brunch
palette and I did a video about it I can
leave it link down below and I got so
many comments saying like because it's a
pastel palette it's a very light palette
I like the palette I'm not like mad at
it and I don't feel like I gave it a
like a bad review but so many comments
were coming in like don't judge a little
rock on this palette and get the lorac
unzipped palette or the unzipped goal
pout like I kept seeing those comments
so to see that they're gonna be 50% off
this might be a good time for me to buy
that lorac palette so would you guys
recommend the unzipped or the unzipped
gold palette let me know but that's
interesting on Tuesday April 4th from
pur cosmetics they're four and one
pressed mineral powder foundation it's
regularly 2950 it's gonna be on sale for
$18 I talked about this powder so much
I've talked about it in my ride-or-die I
talked about and my most repurchase
makeup I love this stuff I use it all
the time I've gone through so many been
wearing it since college I personally
don't need a backup because I just got a
backup not that long ago but if you guys
want to try it out I'm telling you it's
a really really good powder and you can
get it for a little bit cheaper so on
Thursday April 6 there's going to be
another item from Juice Beauty and
another one from their stem cellular
line this is the anti wrinkle booster
serum it's gonna be 50% off it's
regularly $78 and this can
be on sale for 39 I might have to think
about that one
on a Friday April 7th from tart the
Amazonian clay blush and highlighter are
going to be 50% off regularly 28 on sale
for 14 this is another one I hear such
good things about the Tarte blushes and
I don't own any so to try them out at

good way to go
and then the last day of the sale which
is Saturday April 8th the Anastasio
Beverly Hills brow Wiz pencils are gonna
be 50% off regularly $21 they'll be on
sale for 10:50 but I know everybody
likes silence that's the umbrellas
pencils I don't know if I would pick one
up for myself because I have a hard
enough time doing puzzles of those but
maybe it'd be a good time to get it a
little bit cheaper since I probably
won't know how to use it but hey if
you're a big fan of the bow is it's
gonna be on sale and also the benefit
brow service you get a free brow wax
with any $50 benefit purchase that's the
$21 value I believe if you buy something
online on that date like if you were to
get the $50 worth of benefit products on
that day they'll send you a coupon to
use in-store I'm pretty sure is how that
works
but that's the whole calendar not the
