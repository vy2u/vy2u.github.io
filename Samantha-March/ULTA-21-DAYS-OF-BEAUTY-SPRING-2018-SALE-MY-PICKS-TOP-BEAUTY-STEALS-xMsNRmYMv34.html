today's video is going to be my Ulta 21
days of beauty video I'm so excited I
love making these videos as famous
listed for a vib sale videos they're
just humph my favorite to make also 21
days a beauty sale does a start today I
was hoping to have my video up a little
bit earlier but they took their sweet
time getting it the rest of the deals up
online typically if you're signed up for
like the ultime lers you'll get the
catalog in the mail but then it's a few
days later that they release even more
deals and platinum perks and things like
that they'll release it on their website
and they finally got that up so I wanted
to make my video and get it up the day
that it is starting the Ulta 21 days of
beauty over on March 18th to April 7th
and what it is every single day they
will have a couple of new deals on there
they are 1-day deals some of them will
be online only some of them you can also
get in store some of them will be for
platinum members only I don't know if
I've seen really anything about the
diamond members I feel like everything I
saw said like platinum perks but some of
these deals can run out the quantities
could be limited or also what is called
hot buys and those are discounted items
that you can get all during the sale
they're not just a one-day thing but
they also do run out as well so if
there's something that you're very
curious about I always suggest grabbing
it because they can go out of stock the
last ultra 21 days of beauty I think it
was dose of colors that had their liquid
lipsticks like half off and I went to my
computer first thing in the morning and
they were all completely sold out
already and I was pretty bummed about it
I hear that the deals a start around
midnight but what time zone I don't know
I hear very conflicting things
some say it's PST s I don't know that
for sure and I think maybe it is varying
but I did want to throw that out there
because I feel like that's one of like
my most asked questions I will have the
link to the altar 21 days of beauty
calendar in my description box of course
and anything that I highlight I will
also have linked in there how I do my
Ulta 21 days of beauty is that I
mentioned products that I think are a
good deal or a good item or a product
that I am I am for myself so anything I
don't mention is just something that I
mean they're not interested in maybe I
don't think is a great deal of maybe I
don't think is a great product or things
like that so I mostly just cover the
items that I'm excited about or that I
would recommend to you or that I think
is some
things that I've seen be talked about a
lot that I think would work well for
somebody so that's weird of you doing
today I hope that you guys are excited
for this video and why don't I go ahead
and get started with the calendar so
like I said I won't be touching on every
single day but it starts March 18th
today and I saw that a platinum perk is
the lorac pro 3 palette it's 50% off
regularly $44 it's gonna be sale on sale
for $22 I don't think that I'll be
getting this myself I don't have any of
the rock pro palettes and I've always
kind of been interested in them but I
don't think I need a new eyeshadow
palette right now even for 50% off but
if you've always want to pick up one of
the lorac pro pellets it could be good
to do it at a discount on March 20th the
pier 4 and one press mineral powder
foundation is going it to be on sale
it's normally 2950 it's gonna be on sale
for 1475 that's one of my favorite
powder foundations is actually the first
items that I ever purchased from Pierre
many many many many years ago it kind of
what just got like me started on the
brand Pierre in general so it's one of
my favorite powders I have one in my
collection and I would highly recommend
it as a powder foundation on Wednesday
the 21st the Smashbox photo finish
primer water is $32 it's going to be on
sale for $16 I think it was also in the
auto 21 days of beauty
last time typically it is in the spring
and like fall time I believe it usually
happens twice a year but during the last
one it was also half off and that is
when I picked up my primer water I do
enjoy it it's just hard for me to spend
$32 on a primer water so when I saw it
was on sale the last time I picked it up
I do not need to refill yet but you've
been interested in it I think it would
be a good deal I also saw this one this
is interesting to me it's the my phone
keeps lighting up it's like freaking me
out like what what okay online only the
persona identity palette is going to be
50% off so it's normally $32 it's going
to be $16 I was just talking about
persona cosmetics recently in one of my
will I bias and I was talking about her
highlights and I mentioned that I'm
interested in the brand because I have
heard rave reviews about this identity
palette so for it to be half off is
pretty amazing I actually just got it
sent to me I'm persona cosmetics saw my
will i buy it video and ended up sending
me over a highlight plus the identity
palette which I am so excited for I
can't wait to try it out but if I didn't
get it
that would have been one that definitely
would have caught my attention because
like I've said I've heard amazing things
about that palette so I think that's a
pretty good steal at 50% off on March
22nd that is a Thursday my best friend's
birthday the buxom full-on lip creams
are half off they're normally $20
they're gonna be on sale for $10 each in
case you were wondering I still have not
found my buxom white Russian or dolly
lip glosses can't think of which video I
was talking about the my nose my
February lip pics and I said I moved
them to put them in a safer spot can't
find them I'm kind of thinking about
grabbing one though at $10 because I do
like them for a lip gloss I like that
they have a little bit of a plumping
effect but it's nothing like too extreme
and they don't like hurt my lips or
anything like that I do like the two
shades I have and I mean if I if I
really can't find them maybe I should
get another one I think that's a good
deal for half-off March 23rd that's my
word thick that's not very good
there's 23rd Urban Decay eyeshadow
singles are gonna be half off they're
$20 each they're going to be on sale for
$10 I don't think that I would need any
single shadows myself I have plenty of
like Urban Decay palettes and I'm just
more I'm more of a palette girl that I
am a singles but I know a lot of people
enjoy the Urban Decay singles
I think half-baked is like one of the
most popular eyeshadows out there and
also notice that online only the velour
lashes are going to be 50% off so it
says they're regularly about $14 and
they'll be on sale for 7 I might do this
because I've never tried velour lashes
and I'm not super familiar with the
brand obviously I've never tried them
but I feel like every once in a while
I'll hear someone say that they're
wearing bluer lashes and I just I love
lashes I'm not wearing them today
because I have a super hair i am super
tired today but i knew i had to film
this video and i'm going to go lay down
after this i have been hanging out with
georgia harris a fellow youtuber here
she drove down to iowa and we did some
filming together but whoo and it's been
a whirlwind until we filmed before i
probably close to like 3 hours when she
was here so I'm just like all sorts of
tired so this was the best that I could
do for today so I don't have my
is on today but I love wearing washes I
just feel like they complete the I look
for me personally so I'm interested in
that one I might grab a pair and see
what I think on March 25th the 8th
Cosmetics has some sales the confidence
in a compact is regularly 38 it'll be on
sale for 19 I haven't tried it myself
but I feel like I hear a lot about it I
don't know if it would be something that
I would grab for me but I feel like I
hear good things and then also it
brushes for Ulta that airbrush
smoothing soothing smoothing foundation
brush the number 102 is regularly 22
it's gonna be on sale for 11 I feel like
every single uLTA Beauty sale uLTA
Beauty sale also 21 days of beauty sale
I said that I'm interested in the it
brushes for Altima that comes out and
I'd never purchased one I don't think I
need another foundation brush at the
moment but a lot of dollars I mean
that's not bad it's not bad
a platinum perk on that day also is the
benefit Porefessional is going to be 50%
off so it is normally 31 dollars it's
gonna be on sale for 1550 if I can read
my handwriting I do like the
Porefessional it's not my absolute
favorite primer but I do think that it's
pretty good and for a pricy primer to
get it half off I don't think that
that's terrible
let's see here March 26 we have some
sales from oh this is a good day for me
the Becca backlight priming filter and
first light priming filter they're each
$38 they'll be on sale for $19 each I am
NOT a huge fan of the backlight priming
filter I think it makes me look to like
to oily like it's not like a good glowy
than it makes me it's like oil
especially when I wear it for a
prolonged period of time so that one's
not my favorite but I actually really do
like the first light priming filter
that's one that I feel like makes you
just look hydrated and gives you a bit
of a glow I really do like that one I've
been through some samples of it I think
it is really good so for half off I
don't think that's bad steel at all
also the lam comb Hypnose drama instant
full volume mascara is regularly 2750
will be on sale for 1375 that's one of
my favorite mascaras I actually have
repurchased that I was probably like in
a VIP sale because I have a hard time
paying full price especially for
high-end mascaras because I wear false
lashes so much but that's actually a
really good mascara so for the half off
that's a pretty good deal and there's
also a skincare
from a first aid beauty to love your
skin that said I think it has five
different items in there it's gonna be
50% off normally 44 it'll be on sale for
22 I'd really like first aid beauty
they're kind of geared more toward
people with sensitive skin which is me
so I've tried a lot of their products
and I almost always have the facial
radiance pads in my collection and I
don't even know why I'm saying almost
always I always have the facial radiance
pads in my collections or just like one
of those staple products to me but I do
like a lot of their skincare but see
March 27th that is my husband's birthday
we have so many birthdays in March it's
crazy this is something that I'm
interested for me this is it's online
only it's from San Tropez it's an inch
shower gradual tanning lotion normally
$25 gonna be on sale for 1250 I'm just I
don't know I'm always really interested
in self-tanning I felt an almost once a
week like sometimes it's depending on
what tanner
I'm using if I can make it happen but
especially in the winter pale this time
and now Iowa I like to stay itself tan
if I can so I was interested in that one
and I also wrote down a book this one is
online only as well the COPE re coconut
melt is gonna be 50% off regularly 28
it's gonna be on sale for 14 the KO
party coconut melt I feel like I've just
heard a lot of people talk about I feel
like I've always kind of like seen buzz
about this one so it's always kind of
been on the back of my mind so when I
saw it for the half off I was like
mm-hmm what do you guys say what do you
think about Coco has anyone tried the
coconut milk I would be interested I
would be interested to know that but I
thought that that day it looked pretty
interesting March 29th at the Benefit
Cosmetics roller lash super curling and
lifting mascaras half off at normally 24
it'll be on sale for 12 that's a really
solid mascara it's one that ivory
purchased several times over myself and
I almost always do have that one in my
collection so it's just a good mascara
especially to lengthen and curl the
lashes and let's see here next up I have
on March 31st the anasazi Beverly Hills
brow Wiz it's going to be half off
normally 21 it's gonna be on sale for
10:55 the unsiyyah
Braille Wiz and I don't absolutely love
it but I don't absolutely hate it and
I'm kind of thinking about it for half
off because I would not want to purchase
this one at full price because I don't
absolutely love it
but it's
Dease eyebrow pencil to me so I don't
know that one I'm kind of considering
for just the time 50 I'm like I could
maybe do that so I might do that one I
know a lot of people really enjoy that
brow pencil as well and I feel like I
see it in the alte 21 days a beauty
quite a bit but if you love it and you
want to back up of course now's a great
time to do it or if you've wanted to try
it out and see if you think it's worth
the hype half-off is definitely a great
time to do that and then entering into
the third week so we have a Sunday April
1st online only this caught my attention
for sure the dose of colors marvelous
mobs eyeshadow pellet it's going to be
half off it's normally $32 this can be
on sale for 16 Thank You T needy get
that eyeshadow palette
I love the dose of colors 5-minute
palettes I think that they are fantastic
I have marvelous moths I have fake brown
I have sassy Sienna's I'm super bummed
that it's not like you know maybe I can
understand that not all of the palettes
would be half off but I'm bummed then
it's only marvelous moths because I
would really love the berry eyeshadow
palette and then I feel like there's one
more is there one more do I almost have
them all I want them all so it is the
marvelous mobs it's a beautiful
eyeshadow palette I wear it a ton I talk
about it a ton I talk about the dose of
colors eyeshadow palettes just in
general ton so that's a really really
good deal like I said that one might be
one that goes fast just like the dose
that liquid lipsticks during the last
sale so that one's online only girl
second I see a platinum perk at the it
cosmetics in your glow this was like a
I'll be inserting photos in here but
it's like a blush palette and it does
come with a brush if you wanted I think
you pay more to get the brush but it's
50% off so normally 13 it's on sale for
16 when these came out they have a
couple different shades of them I think
it's just blush or maybe it's blush and
highlight but I don't know they were
just kind of cool they reminded me of
the Kevin a Kwan like highlight palettes
as well how they kind of like ombre and
they have like different shades and
tones and finishes in there you can use
them individually or you can swipe them
all together I can actually remember
putting these in a bowl i buy a video
being like I'm super interested in these
for whatever reason I actually don't
have a ton from a cosmetics I think I've
maybe only tried the CC cream so I don't
have a lot from the brand that I'm like
yes absolutely we're gonna try but for
some reason that one always gave me a
double
so I don't know I don't know it did
anyone try those are they even any good
or would you be interested in getting
them would you recommend them to me I
don't that's just this one that always
caught my attention and then I also
notice that Mac is having a lip kit on
sale and this one is pretty interesting
to me this is a platinum perk if I
didn't say it's gonna be half off
normally 3950 on sale for 1975 but you
get the full-size that prep and prime
and then you also get a full-size of the
velvet teddy lipstick which I absolutely
love and then you also get a full-size
lip liner and a boldly bear I believe it
was I thought that was a pretty good
deal I don't use the preppin prime a
time to kind of like prep and prime your
lips or lipstick but velvet teddy is a
beautiful shade and boldly bear is I
don't use lip liners a ton but that's
one of like my most you use lip liners
because it's a nice nude so I think
that's a pretty good deal for those Mac
products we are almost done I feel like
I'm whipping through this that my bed my
bed is called my name real hard on April
5th the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion is going to be on sale looks like
it says it's regularly 20 to 24 dollars
will be on sale for 10 to 12 dollars I
really want to pick one up I have the
original and I do really like it but I
hear really good things about Eden and I
think that's the one that I want to pick
up I feel like that's the one that most
people use and recommend so I think that
is one that I might do because I really
I like having a good eye shadow primer
in my collection I mentioned several in
my overlook makeup products I do think
that they help especially for me like I
just I don't skip priming my eyes
anymore I think that they really do help
so I'm interested in that on April 6 the
Dermalogica at daily Micro Foley and
it's normally $57 and it's gonna be on
sale for 2850 Dermalogica is one of my
most used skin care brands I have a ton
from the brand ivory purchased items
from the brand and they have some really
solid products and the daily micro Foley
and I think would be a good one and
especially at half off like that's a
good time to buy a history much but it
does have very pricey skincare and then
the last day on April 7th I noticed that
Mac has their mac fix+
is going to be half off normally $26
it's going to be on sale for 13 I love
the fixed plus I'm almost out of the one
that I have now I already
back up of it and this is the original I
know they've come out with like
different scents and things like that
but I believe it's just the original one
I believe there's going to be on sale
but solid setting spray I really enjoy
it I use it for a lot of different
functions as well I would highly
recommend that so if you need a backup
I've always wanted to try it all the 21
days of beauty is the great time to do
it so that is each day of the calendar
that interests me again everything that
I mentioned will also be a link to
separately down below in case you're
curious about anything and then also
moving over to the Hot Buys so like I
said that the Hot Buys are going to be
available at our discounted prices
throughout the entire duration of the
auto 21 days of beauty and just the
items that I mentioned prior those are
the one-day sales these also do sell out
so let's see here the pure miracle mist
hydrating spray is regularly $18 it's
going to be on sale for 40% off at $10 I
do like that spray it has a very very
fine mist to it which I do appreciate
about it and it is nice and hydrating I
noticed I referred out quite a bit in
the summertime when I just need a little
bit of a boost so it's not my absolute
favorite setting spray but it's a good
one so I would recommend it for the $10
there's a lot of different eyeliners
that are on sale and the ones that have
me really excited and that I will be
making some purchases from are these
Smashbox always on eyeliners there are
regularly $21 they're going to be 40%
off and available at $12 I do want to
pick up a couple different shades of
these this is one of my favorite
eyeliners it's so it's it's selfish
opening but when you put the cap on and
you twist the eyeliner it's actually
always sharpening it so it's like super
easy and you always have a really sharp
point to the eyeliner but it's also very
creamy and pigmented and I think there's
great eyeliners so I want to pick up
some more of those some has the monster
big duo mascara set normally 21:50 on
sale for $14 I've never tried these but
I feel like I hear a lot about them it
looks like it has like a primer and then
the Mahseer big getting mascara I don't
know about that one $14 isn't bad but I
don't really do much with the primer so
and I don't know if I'll if I'll end up
doing that one but I feel like I hear a
lot about it and then there's some
skincare that is on sale but honestly
like nothing that really jumps out at me
that I
think I absolutely have to have anything
I'll have the the hot bite link also
down below I did see that pathology has
it's called the spoiled run at home at
pampering kit it's regularly twenty five
dollars it's going to be at thirty
percent off it's going to be seventeen
fifty I do really like pathology I like
a lot of their sheet masks it has the
rejuvenating eye gels the hydrating look
gels the illuminate flash masks and then
also the posh peel pedicure intensive
foot peel treatment I really do enjoy
the foot peel I think of that it works
very well but I do really liked our
sheet masks and if they don't have any
of like my absolute like must-have
favorites on here like the milk peel is
a really good one and the mud mask I
think is fantastic so I think this one
is still pretty good if you want to try
out how Geology it could be a good way
to do it but they don't have any of like
my absolute staples besides that that
foot peel which i think is really good
but other than that there wasn't a ton
of the hop eyes that like really caught
my attention that I absolutely needed to
have but there was plenty in the
calendar that you know intrigued me that
I'm going to be making notice of so
other than that that's gonna be
everything for the calendar and then a
simple Hot Buys the items that caught my
attention or I wanted to recommend with
Auto 21 days of beauty sale okay so
that's gonna be everything a for today's
video again like I said everything will
be linked and listed in the description
box down below
I'll have the calendar down there the
link to the hop eyes and then also
everything that I mentioned in here I
will also link that one individually in
case you are interested in anything but
like I said the sale starts today if you
are a platinum or a diamond member your
items will ship free no matter what it
is that you're getting so even if
there's only one Beauty still that you
want or one hop buy that you want even
if it's only ten dollars if you are a
platinum or diamond member it will ship
to you for free otherwise you do need to
spend the minimum of fifty dollars for
free shipping I wish that they would
just have free shipping during this but
if you're a platinum or diamond member
then you can get that advantage but
other than that I think that's all the
information that I have but for today I
thought you guys are excited let me know
what you were most excited to see in the
sale and what you are planning to pick
up but other than that if you guys did
enjoy this video or you found it helpful
and that you'll give it a thumbs up I
hope that you'll also consider
