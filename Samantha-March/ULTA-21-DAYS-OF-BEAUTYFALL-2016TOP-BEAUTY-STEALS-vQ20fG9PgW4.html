today's video I want to go over the
Alpha 21 days of beauty event so this
video is coming a little bit late and I
do apologize for that for some reason i
did not even think to do this video and
it was actually my snapchat that
convinced me to do it the Ulta 21 days
of beauty if you are not familiar with
it i will kind of explain what it is and
go over the sale but the reason why when
people started asking me on snapchat if
i was going to film this video the
reason that I decided I was going to do
it was because the 21 days of beauty
that alta had in the spring of this past
year before then i actually was not
familiar with the event and it was a
youtube video i I'm pretty positive it
was jammed beauty 89 she did a video
about the altar 21 days of beauty and I
watched it and I was like dang I really
didn't even know that was a thing like I
get the emails and I'd get the the
catalogs for also but I just kind of
like briefly glanced at it figuring like
oh it's just another sale you know
everyone has sales this isn't a big deal
but really like it's kind of similar to
me to like the support behav Salem we
all go crazy for it so I was really
thankful for that YouTube video because
it really helped me understand all the
21 days of beauty and then I got real
excited for it and I went to Altos
several times over the event to buy
things and even placed an online order
so I'm hoping this video will be helpful
for you guys as well maybe if you aren't
super familiar with it or maybe you are
familiar with it but you haven't decided
like what you're going to get what what
looks good on the calendar i'm going to
pick out a few of the days that i think
are like really bond days and let you
guys know what i think and what I think
you guys should get so yeah hopefully if
I'm this helpful and I'm really sorry
that I didn't even think to do this
video I was sharing the calendar of
events on my snapchat and so many people
are screen shouting and then people were
asking me questions I got asked if I was
going to make this video and I thought
duh I should do that but this past
weekend was Labor Day weekend we were
traveling so I'm filming this as fast as
I can i'm going to edit it as best as i
can but i can get it up in somewhat of a
timely manner thought I am a few days
late but regardless i'm really excited
to be doing this video for you guys i
hope you find it helpful and let's
and I will explain what exactly the Alta
21 days of beauty is the Alta catalogs
in the mail this is the one with the 21
days at Beauty you can see the 21 days
of beauty is little icon up there and
then right when you open it up to the
first page it has the full calendar of
the event it breaks it down for you by
day because basically the also 21 days
of beauty is every single day starting
September fourth and the final day is
sep tember 24 there are special daily
deals these are called beauty steals and
they are for one day only so it's not a
surprise I really like the way that also
breaks it down for you you can also i
will link it down below so you can see
the calendar online as well if you did
not get the catalog but it is really
helpful because you can plan your
schedule it's not like it's going to be
a surprise you wake up and they're like
oh today's special is so and so and
you're like oh should I get it should I
not you can plan ahead you can figure
out what it is you want to do for me
personally I really do like to place
online orders because of course they
love ebates if you don't have ebay so
i'll link it down below I like getting
cash back for my orders I like in
examples but honestly when it comes to
the altar 21 days of beauty i typically
go in to the store because a lot of
times it's just that one thing that i
buy and you guys know if you watch my
videos i don't like to pay for shipping
and so to get free shipping like I feel
like I would just be buying things that
maybe I really didn't need to buy just
because I'm trying to get these beauty
steals so for me it's typically easier
just to go into alta grab the product is
that i want you know sometimes it's only
a ten dollar item is it ten dollar item
pay for it check out boom you're done a
number with so that typically is what i
do and that just kind of saves me from
not overspending you know i'm saying i
mean if you look like built up your love
the list with in alta and you have all
these products that you want to purchase
yeah maybe you can break it down to
several online orders you can get you
guys you can get your samples do you you
know but i just think it's really cool
that we have the calendar broken down so
you can see each beauty steal every
single day i think that's really amazing
so I definitely suggest going through
the calendar looking through it picking
out which ones are your favorites which
day
you want to go seeing if it's better for
you do you want to go into Alta do you
want to place an order online but also i
suggest especially on days where the
beauty skills are like really hot ticket
items if you are going to go into alta i
suggest getting there early if you can
because these items do sell out and they
will sell out so that's another thing so
if it is going to be easier for you to
order online right away in the morning
because you can't get to Alta until
later that night you might want to order
online because i have seen these items
sell out and i have had items sell out
that i wanted to get and i was very
upset about it so learn my lesson there
so i'm going to pass that over to you
these do and will sell out bo thing what
I think about these beauty steals within
the also 21 days of beauty is that some
of the products that go on sale our
prestige brands and you know that alta
usually has that like three dollar and
50 cent coupon you know you get 350 off
your order you get ten percent off you
get twenty percent off you know they
have these coupons that comes out a lot
but always in the little you know terms
and conditions that says not valid on /
speech makeup so you know to face tart
benefit anastasiya your coupon codes
cannot be applied to those high end
makeup brands they are only for the non
high end makeup well during the sale if
you look at the calendar we have urban
decay it cosmetics lorac steal a
two-faced heart Anasazi Beverly Hills
Smashbox Laura Geller these are the
items that are going on sale so this is
a really really good time to buy the
prestige brand items that you might
really want like if there's something on
here that you are really interested in
getting in you see it's for sale and
it's from a prestige brand this is the
time to get it because more unlikely
those are not going to go on sale again
you don't see sales on the prestige
brands you can't use your coupons on the
prestige brands so during the altar 21
days of beauty that is the best time to
purchase these items I'm not kidding so
that's another thing that I think is
really really awesome so definitely take
a look at that calendar again pick out
what you think that you really want
maybe your favorite mascara is we're
gonna be for sale on here you know maybe
even stock I want to grab a couple
because they're not going to go on sale
again so I think that's really awesome
I also believe the 21 days of beauty I
think it happens twice a year I think
it's in the spring and in the fall so
kind of like the Sephora vib usually has
like spring and fall as well type of
dealio I think that's what this one is
too so we won't get another 21 days of
beauty until next spring i think it was
in like april that it happened last year
want to go through and pinpoint some of
the beauty steals that i think are
really really awesome the ones that I
definitely have my eyes on so the first
one that kind of caught my eye is for
thursday September eight that it says
the juice beauty kids are doubt nineteen
dollars and fifty cents to 2450
regularly there were 39 249 intrigues me
because I hear a lot of people talk
about the juice beauty skin care and how
much they love it and I really really
enjoy kits and trying out minutes before
I go and like purchase a full size of
skincare because if you don't like it or
if it doesn't agree with your skin and
you've just wasted your money and now
you have a huge product that you can't
do anything with so I'm really curious I
think I'm gonna try out one of these
juice beauty kids just because I've I've
almost pulled the trigger so many
different times on buying a few
different items from them so to be able
to get a kit and to be able to get it
what like essentially half off yeah I
think that's a pretty good deal so
that's Thursday September eighth been
hearing a lot about the tart lip
sculptor lipstick and gloss they are
regularly $24 they will be on sale for
twelve dollars so they're double end at
you have a lipstick in one end and a lip
gloss at the other I personally don't
know how I feel about that really but so
many people are talking about these and
I'm kind of like huh okay I get it
twelve dollars you get a lipstick and
you get a lip gloss that's not a bad
deal and I really do like tart so that
might be something to think about as
well on Saturday September tenth of
philosophy is having their micro
delivery exfoliating wash you get eight
ounces for $14 regularly it's 28 I hear
a lot of the things about the philosophy
brand as well I've never tried anything
from them so again might be a good time
to try something out where you get it
half off that's pretty cool I'm really
excited for sunday September 11th the
tart lights camera lashes eyeliner will
be on sale for half off regularly its
twenty dollars it's going to be
on sale for 10 I love eyeliner I'm a
complete eyeliner junkie I hear a lot of
good really good things about this tart
eyeliner so I definitely have that one
in mind think I'm going to need to pick
one up for myself if you use a
clarisonic I don't put this kind of call
my eye on Friday September 16th you can
buy one brush head and get one free
regularly their 27 to 32 dollars so buy
one get one free like that's a pretty
good deal I know a lot of people use the
clarisonic soar even something similar
to them so if you use the clarisonic and
you need more brushes I won't go in free
you might as well do it the really big
day that I think is going to be a very
very popular one like this is the day
that I have marked in my calendar to
actually go into Alta is going to be on
Saturday September 17th the Urban Decay
afterglow blushes regularly $26 they
will be on sale for thirteen dollars
they just had a lot of hype around them
for a while and I've even been hearing a
lot of people like once the sale came
out was announced this is the one that
everyone is sharing about because people
are really really excited for this to go
on sale I am NOT a huge blush person
myself but because I've been hearing so
much about these afterglow blushes I'm
like might have to pick me up one so
that is a really good deal but also on
Saturday September's 17 you can get a
free brow wax at the benefit brow if
you're also has one and there I know are
so I don't know if every Alta does but
ours for sure I know has one but I was
like okay there has to be like a catch
here you can't just go and get a free
brow wax right you do have to spend
fifty dollars on benefit products or I
think it's fifty dollars on another
service so you can get another so long
service done and then get the free brow
wax so I don't know for sure if i'll do
it i've actually been doing a pretty
good job of keeping my eyebrows plucked
and everything so I don't know if I want
to grow them out in the next two weeks
to be able to get them waxed but I'll
have to think about it but if you know
that you want to pick up some stuff from
benefit you know hold off until this day
for someone who needs a brow wax or it
gets your browser / waxed regularly hold
off for a little bit then go into ulta
on what was it saturday September 17th
by your benefit products stop at the
brow bar
get your brows waxed that could be a
pretty good deal so I thought that was
interesting but definitely the Urban
Decay blush to like I think that one's
going to be a pretty pretty big deal on
Sunday September 18th Mario Badescu
house their acne facial cleanser for 750
it's a regularly $15 i really like the
Mario Badescu line so I have this one
circled as well I might need to give
that a whirl also on Tuesday September
20th and the if brushes for also their
buffing mineral powder brush regularly
$13 it's half off at fifteen dollars
I've never tried the it cosmetics
brushes but I hear so much good about
them and I'm kind of like maybe I should
get a thirty-dollar brush for fifteen
dollars like that's not a bad deal and
it's so funny because every time I go
into alt I swear I go past they
cosmetics brushes and I just like feel
them cuz they're so soft and they feel
so good but I've never done it I've
never bought wine so that could be the
day that I do and then on Saturday
September 24th the tart lights camera
lashes mascara its regularly $21 it's
going to be on sale for ten dollars that
is actually a beauty steal that I picked
up at the last alta 21 days beauty event
everyone seems to love this mascara it's
very very hyped about so to get it you
know a little bit more than half off
even $21 for only ten dollars if that's
like with your favorite mascara cuz i
know so many people love it like grab
two or three you might as well because
it's going to be on sale and it's not
going to be on sale again for a very
long time if ever so i thought that was
a really good deal so those were just
some that i wanted to pin point out to
you guys that kind of got my attention
that i think could be kind of like
popular buys but definitely go through
the calendar like i said there's so many
prestige brands in here are not usually
on sale you don't usually get to use
your discounts with them so if you see
something that you want to try or
something that catches your eye
definitely during the also 21 days of
beauty is the time to try it out so I
thought that calendar was really great
again I will leave the calendar linked
below like a link to it so you can
easily find it as well I'll also link
all of these products directly in the
description box below so if on that day
that you do decide that you want to get
it you can have
link so you can get to it right away and
get it purchased or of course if you
want to go into your alta too so i'm
going to be making a couple altitudes
probably in the next few weeks here but
hey it's worth it i love getting stuff
at a cheaper price which it's fantastic
the last thing that I want to touch on
with you guys is what is called hot buys
and these are a couple of items that
will be on sale during the entire 21
days of beauty event so the beauty
steels are only for those one day you
can only get them at their sale price on
that one day but these three hot bias
will be on sale from September forth
through September 24th so I wanted to
point those out real quick you guys as
well in case you are interested in
getting it you know maybe you've picked
out a day like next week that you're
going to get into ulta to grab the
beauty steal well you can also grab
these Hot Buys while you're there if
they are not sold out because these can
also sell out because they are on sale
for the entire time you know they might
sell out earlier than the event gets
over so just a fair warning there but
one is the skin Iceland hydro cool
firming face gels and these are on sale
that are regularly $35 and they're on
sale for 1750 which is a great deal I am
NOT personally familiar with this brand
even I've never tried anything like this
but it sounds pretty cool and I'm really
into like that I have like the gel under
eye masks that I really like and I also
really like sheep mask so I don't know
the firming face gels that sounds pretty
cool to me and that's a really big
discount so definitely if you're
interested in something like that you
could check these out another hot by is
from julep and it's the it's whipped
matte lip moose it's regularly twenty
dollars and it's on sale for twelve
dollars again not something that I've
tried myself so I can't personally tell
you if I would recommend it or not if
you're a big fan of lippies as well or
if you really like the brand julep I'm
not super familiar with the brand either
but could be a good option you get to
save a couple dollars on this one and
then the last hat by that will be on
sale through the entire alta 21 days of
beauty will be from Tarte and it's the
colored clay CC under I corrector
regularly $24 and it's going to be on
sale for fifteen dollars i recently
watched coffee break with danny she did
a video on this all to 21 days of beauty
which was a very very help
video I can go ahead and that link down
below as well she also talks about a
couple of alta exclusives that i thought
were interesting but to be honest i'm
not sure how they tie in with the 21
days of beauty event so i'm not going to
go over them but i will link Danny's
video down below because i found it very
helpful as well but she raved about this
heart color corrector i personally have
not tried it myself but because she
talked about it like so hyped in her
video i kind of want to try it and since
it'll be at this kind of like maybe that
will be one of the days that i happen to
alta to grab something else i might try
to pick this up for myself because she
made it sound like it was really really
good so that is another product that
will be on sale through the entire alta
21 days of beauty event so that ends
again on sep tember 24th so I didn't
want to point out those Hot Buys to you
as well because they'll be on sale the
entire time so while I'm not super
familiar with any of these three
products I wanted to make sure to
mention it to because it's another sale
is happening and we love sales I love
sales you probably love sales to
everything for the also 21 days of
beauty sale info that i feel like i can
give you guys i really hope that you
found this video helpful like i said it
was really how I found out about the
auto 21 days of beauty I really didn't
pay much attention to the catalog or the
emails that were coming in and I don't
know why because this is a really really
awesome event and you know maybe it's
just because I've been buying makeup so
much more that I'm really understanding
that when prestige brands go on sale and
you get to have money off like that's
the time to buy them and you guys know
that I'm always doing giveaways as well
so also when I can buy prestige brands
at a lower price for giveaways that is
like music to my ears because i had to
pay for everything for the giveaway so
that i put on for you guys so to be able
to buy something at a little bit of a
cheaper price that helps me out so much
so if you're a youtuber and you need to
get a few giveaway items definitely
check this calendar and see what would
work for your outcome and giveaways
because you might as well get it I
cheaper price because I know that the
giveaways can be a really really
expensive for those of us who try and
put them on for you guys and we don't
get the PR packages you have to spend
our own money for it so definitely check
into it but like I said I hope you found
this helpful these videos have been
really helpful to me in the past
even just yesterday when I watched
coffee break with Danny I learned a lot
from her video so I really hope that I
was able to help some of you guys out as
well if you guys are going to buy
anything from the auto 21 days of beauty
event please do let me know in the
comments below which items you are most
excited to get or since it's been going
on for a few days have you already want
anything let me know if you have I hope
you will give this video a thumbs up if
you did enjoy it or found it helpful I
hope you will subscribe before you go
and I will cut you real soon in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
