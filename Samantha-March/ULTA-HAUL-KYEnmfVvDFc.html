hopefully quite well today's video is
going to be well originally it was going
to be an alcohol I went to Alta probably
at like the beginning of this month and
picked up a few items and I was going to
haul them and then I couldn't wait and i
started using them then i was like oh I
could make this like an alcohol plus
reviews and then i went to walgreens and
bought some stuff then i went to Alta
again and then I picked up a few items
from target so it's gonna kind of be
like a mishmash hall I have a few
reviews thrown in there that i can give
you guys as well so we're just kind of
all over the place today but if you
would like to see a few of my new makeup
and beauty products please keep watch
okay so i just kind of shove everything
into this bag so let's just see what we
got okay right on top okay goody we're
starting with bad news right on top when
I went to Alta I picked up these Vegas
nay lashes by i lure and they were in
the style shining star so that's what
the packaging looks like I got these
lashes because I've heard a lot of
bottom on YouTube um Vegas nay I believe
that she's the really popular Instagram
her and she teamed up with i lure to
create these lashes which I just thought
was really interesting i love when you
know youtubers instagramers etc a team
up with makeup lines and beauty lines
and are able to do a collaboration I
think that is so neat so I was really
interested in getting them a lot of
people were saying that they liked him I
was like yes so I got them and I didn't
I I don't love them so I don't know oh
well almost lost them they don't have
anything to like hold them in here but I
don't know how to do this for y'all I
don't know that's what the lashes look
like on there and so that's kind of what
they look like if you can see that on my
hand at all and the reason why I don't
like them well there they are extremely
large I cut off a good portion
the side which is not a big deal and
sometimes you have to do that with
lashes not a big deal but I remember
opening the package and being like these
are like twice the size of my I live
like what's happening here so I trimmed
him up and stuck them on and the day
that I decided to try them out we were
going to a bar to watch the Cubs
Cardinals playoff baseball game and then
we were planning on going out afterwards
and I thought these seemed like a little
bigger and fuller than you know what I
might normally do so I wanted to make
sure that was like going out somewhere
to wear them and so I thought oh you
know that'll be okay so I did all my
makeup and then I went to put on the
lashes and I was immediately just like
this isn't gonna work they are
incredibly long big fake looking I mean
I just I looked pretty ridiculous with
them on to be honest and I'm trying to
say these in the nicest way that I can I
I don't like not liking products that I
mean it sucks but my biggest issue with
them is that when I put him on and I
would like look up all I could see was
black it was like I had a black smudge
in my eye because these were like so big
and like thick the band is also
incredibly thick which I think played
into that as well but seriously I had
him on around my house her maybe 10
minutes and my eyes hurt because again
they're just so big and the band is so
thick it was hurting to blink my eyes
and I was just like I can't there's no
way that I can go to a bar to watch a 4
30 game laughs throughout the whole game
and then go out at night with these
lashes on there's just no way so I
literally took them off and had to redo
my eye makeup we were late to the game
was a very unhappy day I wasn't very
pleased but unfortunately you know I can
wear these probably for like new year's
Halloween things were like I'm really
trying to be more dramatic i can
probably wear them too but just like
every day or even going out at night I
can't wear them she does have I think
it's maybe like two or three other lash
the line like I have shining star I know
that there's grand glamour which I
looked at the other day and they look
even more ridiculous than these so grand
glamour is probably that one that I
would get but it really did bum me out
the thing was fake eyelash this is that
I love them and I do wear them a lot and
with big eyelashes you know obviously
they're fake I mean there's no fooling
anyone but kind of to me the point of
fake eyelashes is so people kind of look
at you like hangar eyelashes are really
long and pretty do you think they're
real not that people would be like oh my
god have you seen that girls big
eyelashes she looks cry so unfortunately
they don't work out for me okay also
during that ulta trip I spent some time
in the next aisle and I got four new
goodies from nicks and I have used all
of these so I can chat about them okay
let's just get it like all the bad out
of the way so I needed a new my NYX tray
Joel a black gel eyeliner pencil is
almost out and so I wanted to get
another black eyeliner and going through
the Knicks Isles I saw this two-timer
pencil so one end is a coal regular
black liner and then the other end is
like a felt tip more like a liquid liner
and I just thought it was interesting I
think this was like eleven dollars ten
or eleven dollars um I thought it was an
interesting product there was the only
reason I kind of held back was because I
was like I don't know it sounds almost
like kind of gimmicky to me and
sometimes I don't really feel like those
kind of products really work out very
well but I was like that you know i'll
give it a chance something new to talk
about i haven't really seen anyone talk
about this unfortunately it really
doesn't work very well um especially so
the coal side it it's fine that's I mean
if you guys want a swatch that's what it
looks like it's fine but it wears off so
fast and I mean so fast and I really
have to like push hard and go over at
several times like with their gel
eyeliner pen
I mean it's just like one swipe and it
stays on for hours so i use the kohl
pencil when you know i'm not going
anywhere for a long time i don't have
it's not like my special occasion it's
just a regular black eyeliner if i need
to slap some on quick it'll work but i
didn't love it and then the felt tip
side that's a swatch of it there so a
little bit blacker stuff like hair all
over my sweater life it's a little bit
blacker than the coal but again I have
to press hard I think it um it just
doesn't last very long I have the
Maybelline graphic liquid liner and I
think that black stays black for hours
this phase really fast and I don't know
i'm honestly i'm not used to felt two
pencils i think this is maybe is the
first one that I use and it just the
applications for me just was not the
best so unfortunately I don't love this
I'll use it in a pinch or you know like
i said up from not like really going out
and need my long lasting makeup but and
another thing that I got that I was
really excited about was the NYX micro
brow pencil so this is supposed to be a
really good dupe to the Anastasia brow
pencil which like everyone loves but
this I believe was like eleven dollars
it's a lot more affordable so that's I
don't know can you guys see that tip I
don't want to roll it up too much but
that's what it looks like um what color
did I get I think I got blonde got it in
the shade blonde which I'm sure like
wouldn't show up if I try to spot it for
you I'm going to roll it back down so it
has the product on one end and then it
has the spoolie on the other I actually
really like this and I think it really
does make a difference i was really
impressed for someone who's never used
eyebrow pencil before it did take me a
few tries to get it right i was looking
at different youtube videos learning how
to fill in the eyebrows my thing is that
i already have pretty sick and pretty
full eyebrows so I didn't know if I
really needed it but I could definitely
tell a difference once i actually like
shaped them out and i thought it looked
a lot better i did not use it today so
I'm kind of in a hurry and I didn't want
to use it I just used my Maybelline
like gel want to fill in my eyebrows
today but if I have a special occasion
and want to make my eyebrows like butter
I really did like this so yeah very
happy with the micro brow pencil and I
picked up two of the NYX lip liners and
again I don't know what it is with me in
the whiners but this just happened to me
with the Maybelline lip liner to for
some reason I go and thinking they're
like the retractable kind of crayons and
I get him home and they're like the
wooden pencil ones I'm like why why I
don't know that nyx has obviously the
next Idol is huge but I just I must have
saw the sign and then like reached the
wrong one but whatever I didn't even
look at them because they had plastic
all around them but I got two shades one
is nude beige and the other is current
so that one is nude beige it really it
reminds me of whirl from Mac so if you
like world from Mac or wanted to try it
out what you want a more affordable
option nude beige from NYX could be a
good one that one is current so I got
this one because I knew I was getting a
lot mom darker lips lippies for the fall
so I want a darker lip liner to go with
it and I really i like both of these
I've used them quite a bit and this one
really does the nude beige it pairs
really well with lighter shades pink
shades underground from drug cosmetics
that I'd mention a lot is like the gray
lipstick pairs really well with this
again very similar to world by Mac and
then yeah current for your darker
lipsticks and you need a darker lip
liner I thought that one worked really
well so happy with those real quick
because I won't get too in depth with
these because I just filmed my fall
favorite lippies video that I will leave
in the card up low and all three of
these Maybelline lipsticks are mentioned
in that video so go watch that video i
have 9 lipsticks that I've call out for
being fall favorites of mine but these
I'll picked up in recent hull so I want
to talk about them the first one is clay
crush these again are all by Maybelline
this is clay crush this is one of their
matte lipsticks so this dries matte I
think it's
absolutely stunning I'm pretty much
obsessed with it right now that is it
right there it's like a nude beige with
a little bit of brown and I have said
with a brush of fault Linux it's just a
little bit on the darker side but again
the matte lips from Maybelline I have to
get more of these I think they're
incredible and I do think they're longer
lasting than their regular lipsticks
it's not a liquid lipstick and it
doesn't last all day but it's definitely
more longer lasting and then I also
picked up rum Richie which is actually
on my lips right now and this video I
think it is beautiful that is it right
there and you can see it on my lips I
love rum Richie last one I have is
deepest cherry which is the one that I
actually wore in the fall favorite lip
use video so you can see a live swatch
of that one on there as well but that is
Phoebus cherry a beautiful deep cherry
color new fall obsession like obsession
with this thing in killeen lipsticks I
talked so highly in the fall favorites
Lippi's video about Maybelline lipstick
I recommend them to everyone I love all
their lines and i'll be getting more and
then from Walgreens I picked up some
more fake eyelashes because the I lures
did not work out for me I just went back
to the tried-and-true ardell I mean our
dell lashes are the bomb they're super
expensive you can get them at all so you
can get them at walgreens target any
drug stores I just think they're great
i'm wearing some right now i think i'm
wearing like they're naturals i think is
what they are that i have on today but
these ones that I got are the soft touch
and it says they have like feathered
tips is that what it says tapered tips
with ultra lightweight fibers and soft
flex fit lash band so I just thought
these looked really pretty like natural
but with a little bit of an oomph to UM
so I haven't tried these out yet but I
will be really excited too so if you're
new to fake eyelashes or you're just
starting to get into your eyelash game
check out our dad I have a really big
line and their lashes are great also on
my walgreens trip I picked up the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I haven't used it yet i just
mentioned in my recent empties video
that I was almost out of my Maybelline
instant age concealer and I was like I
can't be out of this this has to be in
my collection at all times so I wasn't
kidding I went out and picked it up this
stuff hands down is fabulous it's a Holy
Grail can't not have it and then if
you've been following me on my Instagram
these are the last two items and then we
are done but if you've been following me
on my Instagram I've been talking so
much about the sally hansen miracle gel
line i'm holding them at my hands i can
look the miracle gel lined that i'm just
in love with these nail polishes they
are so good i picked up totally yours
was the first one I picked up and I was
so blown away I was so impressed by it
so I have gone out hand picked up two
more one I got in my walgreens trip and
another one we just went to target the
other day for a few things and I was
like I'll just put this nail polish in
here don't mind me geek but the first
one that I got is persuade that's what
that one looks like and don't mind I was
painting my nails I think while watching
YouTube videos and as I went to put the
wand back in I realized i was actually
put in the wand all over the actual
Tampa oops my bad but I love this one
perfect for fall it's it's like honestly
when I put it on my finger so I was like
it kind of reminds me of like pumpkin
spice that's what I think of when I look
at it I don't even know really anything
about Punkins bias i don't i'm not
really a pumpkin spice kind of girl but
that's what I thought when I have this
one on I wore this in the fall favorite
lippies video i have this nail polish on
so you can see that one on my nails I
also always share nail pictures on
Instagram as well and then this is the
one that I have on my nails right now
this is gray fede oh this polish I put
it on and was like mmm obsessed I said
something on Instagram with this nail
polish is giving me life I just think it
was so pretty i love these like pale
blues and grays I just think it's so
gorgeous the Sally Hansen
okay so i bought one at alta i think it
was and it said it was like no it was
walgreens and it said it was 999 on sale
for 899 and I was like mm kind of
expensive for a nail polish but the
thing about these gel polishes is that
they last usually when I put on like OPI
or señor even the sally hansen like
insta-dry i have a lot of those within a
few hours especially within a day it's
cracked if I take a shower the nail
polish is peeling and it just looks
horrible and hate it these I can wear
for at least a week like a lot of times
when i change my nail polish with this
on it's just because I want a new nail
polish color not because my nails look
bad like I painted these can you guys
see that I painted these probably what
16 hours ago and I don't have any cracks
I have no peeling and that's not normal
for me I mean usually it's just like
nope it's over in a few hours so so
impressed someone did ask me on facebook
if these are hard to remove they are not
hard to remove I can use my regular nail
polish remover that I would do for
anything else and it removes these no
problem the sally hansen 3d gel top coat
that i have that I've mentioned before
that is really hard to get off I have to
use like a special nail polish remover
that I do for like my glitter nail
polish and stuff I have to use that to
remove the sally hansen 3d top coat but
these gel polishes remove super easily
and they drive really fast when i talked
about totally yours i think it was in a
favorites video that i mentioned it I
said how fast it dries it's it's
incredible I love these I will be
picking up several more okay so that is
all for my ulta also again walgreen flew
low target thrown in there that is it
for that Hall I hope you guys enjoyed it
