video is going to be a little bit
different basically I just purchased a
couple of new items recently from Ulta I
wasn't going to be able to do a haul
because it's it's truly three things but
I thought that I could do like a haul
Tryon style a video so that's what we're
going to be doing today I picked up the
dose of colors at sassy see on this
eyeshadow palette I also have the new
Tarte clay played to eye and cheek
palette and then I also have a Catrice
the liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer this isn't a new product but I
hear a lot of people say good things
about it
so I wanted to give it a try so I
thought we could try out all these items
on today and a see what I think about
them so if you would like to see me try
out some of these new items that I
recently picked up from Ulta why don't
we go ahead and get started
all right so we're zoomed in down my
ears long did an eye primer set the eye
primer I do have foundation and brows on
but that is all that I have done so far
and I have to say that my skin is so dry
I really was like do I even want to do
this style of video today because my
skin is just like suffering right now
today is the first day in like four or
five days that we have had positive
temperatures where I live out in Iowa
and I'm not just saying like oh look
it's in the negatives overnight then
like last Saturday the high that day was
negative 3 and then the following Sunday
the high that day was negative 6 like
it's been so crazy cold and even though
I'm fairly leaving my house my skin is
just like done like it's it's just done
and over with I'm doing everything I can
to help it but it hurts like it actually
hurts when I wake up in the morning and
I like yawn it feels like my skin is so
like tight that it's just it's just
painful so there's probably like dry
flakes all over my skin but there's
really I really know that I could do
about that so I wanted to do this video
anyways I just bought these products
I've been excited to test them out so
this is what the sassy siennas palette
looks like from dose of colors I'm so
excited to try this out I believe it was
$32 on the Ulta website I have the
marvelous moths I should I shadow
palette from a dose of colors and I
really do like it it does come up with
this double-ended brush here which I
might bring in a little bit later first
up I'm
come into the middle shade here which is
called foxy I'm going to use my Adel um
tools this is the tapered blending brush
and that's just going to be my crease
color transition color I will say what
dose of colors palettes you get a lot of
kick up in the palette like if you can
see that you get a lot of kick up in the
palette but I don't ever really have a
ton of Fallout on my eyes which I enjoy
and they are super super pigmented like
look at that like well that's very very
pigmented so I'm just compare it was
really beautiful and again very
pigmented this I have not dipped it back
in at all I'm just working on blending
in I think that looks really really good
so I'm gonna take the color right next
to it it's a bit of a richer brown and
this is a morphe brush from the copper
dreams set I believe it's called and I'm
just going to pack that onto the outer
part of the eye and just really kind of
focus that one out here I also really
hope that I don't have like dried blood
on my nose I get nosebleeds when I'm
stressed which is super fun and I'm very
stressed about my six book if you guys
don't know I'm a published author and my
sixth book is going out to beta readers
and going into editing and it's gonna be
the first time I'm getting like true
feedback because the book is written
like the first draft is completely done
it's gonna be the first time that I'm
getting feedback on it and I'm just like
you know it's such a scary feeling
because you don't know or if nobody
likes it then it's like okay well back
to the drawing board you know it's just
kind of a scary feeling so this week has
just been super stressful someone knows
keeps bleeding which is cool so in
between having like a super dry face I
keep having nosebleeds I'm like I am
just a hot mess but you know what um
that's real life loving this like really
rich brown kind of smoky look we have
going on right now I'm really diggin
that but I'm gonna come in with some of
these later shades to get a little sassy
if you don't they use the brush that
came with the palette I'm going to use
this kind of like flat side
and I want to pick up the shade oh my
goodness that is like electric going on
super pigmented as well this shade I
want to keep it focused mostly on the
inner part of my eye and just kind of
have it like fade nicely into the darker
colors on the outer part so I'm just
kind of like tapping my brush around to
deposit that color I love that that
looks so pretty
mmm okay so that is what that shade
looks like and I think it's freaking
gorgeous I'm loving this I'm gonna do
for the eyes for right now I don't think
I want to do winged liner so let me show
you what lashes I'm gonna put on oh I
know this video is mostly focused on
what I picked up from Ulta but I do want
to try a new pair of lashes today - I
got this crazy package from morphe which
had me super excited I was not expecting
to get this and inside is all of their
new lashes and you guys might know how
much I freaking love lashes so when I
got this I was like what I do get some
PR from morphe but not all of it so when
they showed up like this is like the
perfect thing the perfect thing I was so
excited so excited to get this I was
looking at earlier I think the lashes
I'm gonna try today are called a total
babe they just look really interesting
to me how they kind of are longer in the
front I don't know if I have like try to
style like that before so I want to give
these a try
these are $10 and that there's a bunch
of different styles in here I believe
these are only available on the more
people website but I will have a link to
down below but just thought I would show
us which lashes I'm going to put on so
I'm gonna go ahead and pop those on and
then we will move over to the base so I
just got the lashes on and it was
actually pretty challenging it's like
the band is so thin it was almost like
hard to put the adhesive on and the
adhesive was actually like running off
the band onto the lashes because the
band is so thin so the first time I
tried to stick the slash on it actually
didn't even hold because it was so hard
to get that adhesive to stay on to the
band so it was a little bit challenging
I'm not sure yet what I think of them
they feel really nice now like they feel
really nice and
wait and I think they're really pretty
and wispy but I'm gonna have to play
wrong with it a little bit more I like
having a thinner bands of course but
sometimes if they're too thin it's it
makes it more challenging like there
needs to be a nice balance so I'll try
them a little bit more of course on the
lashes I've seen that most lashes I'll
say are easier to put on for the first
time like it's just super easy and they
just pop on right away
but some lashes need a little love first
before they start going on a little bit
easier and that might be what these are
like so I'll keep trying them if anybody
has tried the more peel ashes because
I've know they've been out for a bit let
us know in the comments what you think
and if you had any troubles with them
but I'll keep trying them and I'll
include it in my follow-up video that I
do here in the next couple weeks but I'm
gonna move on into the face for right
now so I picked up the Catrice liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer looks
like this it was $5.99 at Ulta I hear a
lot of people say really good things
about it and I know Nicole Vernon Cutler
always talks about this one I was pretty
sure it was one thing that I noticed
right away what shade did I even get
light beige hopefully that works but
they only have like three shades and
it's like pale list pale and paler and I
was like really that was kind of
interesting to me and I was like I like
I didn't even know how to pick from the
three shades I was like what in the
world they're all very light but we'll
go ahead we'll give a try we're gonna
try here so I'm just going to apply some
to the under eyes the shade looks to be
pretty good for me I'd say like normal I
like to kind of bring my concealer out
here to kind of clean up the shadows it
does have a fragrance to it I'm just
going to do that for right now it does
have a fragrance to it and this is what
the applicator looks like pretty
standard concealer applicator and I am
going to use my L'Oreal sponge I
actually did picked us up from Alta as
well not this one this is my older one
but I did pick up a backup I know I've
had this one for a very long time so I
figured I would get a backup it
definitely is one of my favorite sponges
and super affordable blend out very
easily it looks like a good shade match
for me again light beige but really I
didn't see a whole lot of difference
between the three options that they had
to be honest
it out really smoothly and one thing I
noticed because I have do have so much
dryness going on right now is that it
didn't really make the dry patches look
worse like it almost kind of made them
look a little bit better to be honest at
least on this side let's see how this
side goes but I was kind of worried that
it would look really bad but it just
looks back you know it's just dry skin
is bad so it looks bad not really bad so
hey that's pretty good
so I'm actually like really pretty
impressed I did have a slight red mark
here this morning I slept with up like a
sleeping mask on last night because I've
been having some troubles sleeping cuz
I'm stressed about my book and it's I
lay in bed and I was like oh no did I do
that and you know you know comas come up
in your nightmares and things like that
so I tried out a sleeping mask last
night I don't normally wear them but I
thought I'd give it a shot and I woke up
and I had like a little red mark here so
I don't know if it's from the mask or
what but it actually covered the red
mark pretty easily as well and I really
like how it looks on the under eyes that
it really seemed to cover well too like
it it feels to me like it's full
coverage like it looks like it's full
coverage it doesn't necessarily feel
full coverage I should say it didn't
really feel like really thick at any
point even like as I was applying it and
as I was blending it it didn't feel like
super thick or anything like that so mmm
so far so good with that so I'm just
gonna go ahead and set this with some
powder and then we'll jump into the clay
play tubes I got some thoughts on this
this is the clay plate 2 eyeshadow
palette from a tarts
the outer packaging I mentioned this in
a will I buy a video a couple weeks ago
and I was like so excited for it because
I have the clay play one and it's one of
my favorites it made it my best beauty
video it's in my best music giveaway
video love that palette so much and I
was really surprised when the clay
played to came out because I felt like I
had really heard nothing about it I I
had no idea that release was coming I
saw it on trend mood it was already
available at Sephora I was like what is
happening here I waited a little bit
till it came available at Ulta because I
did have an all that coupon to use it is
46 dollars available at Sephora and Ulta
I still don't see it on the Tarte
website so this is what the inside of it
looks like I don't know if you'll be
able to see it super well because of all
of like the reflective lighting and such
but it has your eyeshadows and then you
have a browser of blush and
highlights now I have the original play
play like I said and you know it's a
similar layout which I expect you know
the clay play to is kind of like the
sister palette so I expect the layout to
be the same but what I don't understand
is why the shade names in the clay play
two are the exact same as the shade
names and the clay play one every single
shade is the same and like this shade
right here is called onyx onyx is
typically black that's a black but when
you come into the clay play - we have
onyx right here which is a bronze
shimmer how does that make any sense
smoke in the original palette is kind of
like a grey makes sense for the name so
right smoke in the clay play - is a pale
shimmer how does that make any sense it
doesn't make any sense desert as a blush
that doesn't make any sense
timber as a highlight that doesn't make
any sense and I am very confused and I'm
actually kind of really angry right now
you know when I saw it available at Ulta
I just kind of bought it right away I I
don't think I've ever looked at shade
names or anything like that when
purchasing something I've never really
been super like that's an important
thing something I care about and knew
that they were going to be similar to
one another I really wasn't expecting
the exact same packaging like I thought
maybe the clay play - would just have
maybe just some different colors like
the same kind of what is this like the
Chevron style but maybe like some
different colors to show that it's
different but then when I opened it up
and saw that all of the shade names were
exactly the same I'm like is this a
mistake a huge mistake because I'm not
the only one that's got a pilot like
this is this just a fail on Tarte are
they what what happened here what
happened and I actually posted about
this on my Instagram and was like what
and a lot of people are chiming in like
is Tarte just lazy did they just have
like extra you know palettes left over
and popped in new shades and what had me
even more frustrated is when I posted
this on Instagram a gal commented in
here and said actually there are some
I'll repeat shades in this palette and
I'm like so they didn't even give us all
new shades in here this has her
Instagram is beauty diction I'll have it
linked down below but it says 7 out of
12 shades are the same as the old
palette they swapped out three of the
matte eyeshadows in the old palette for
shimmers the bronzer is the same as in
the old palette and the blush and
highlight are new
she she said my guess is that they
basically just revamped the old one and
it will disappear at some point and I'm
like so basically I just bought the
exact same palette but with just a few
different shades what what and I've
known I've seen the clay play one being
like significantly discounted at like
$23 $26 $27 and I was very confused cuz
I was like wow like a lot of people seem
to really love the clay play like I'm
surprised it's going on sale etc but
then they come out with the clay play
too but what I thought was really
strange too is I really have not seen
Tarte addressed this palette and I did
ask that because you know I'm I can't
see everything you did I understand that
I missed things for sure
so I asked it on my Instagram because I
follow Tarte on snapchat Instagram I
watched their all other YouTube videos
and they're always playing with their
new items and I'm like why have I not
seen anything about the clay play too
and a couple people wrote in and said
they saw a snapchat tutorial where they
briefly used this palette but they said
not much much else was really mentioned
about it hard has not explained what
this palette is are they facing out the
clay play one why did they just give us
basically the exact same palette with a
few different shade it's like I don't
know but I'm honestly really mad and I'm
very much considering I haven't even
used this yet but I'm very much
considering returning those and getting
my 46 dollars back because for a blush
in highlight and what like to shimmer
shades or whatever but for a blush and
highlight and what the three shimmer
shades or whatever it is I why would I
pay 46 dollars to propel it like that
like it's just it's frustrating to me as
a consumer well I don't know I want to
get your thoughts but I was like you
know what I need to try it and I need to
see what I think of it because maybe the
blush or the highlight in here will be
so fantastic
they like nope I still want to keep this
one I think it's great but I'm really
disappointed like I'm really
disappointed and I wish that Tarte would
say something about this because it's
confusing to me and it's kind of like
why do I need to keep the clay play to
if I have the clay play one and I'm
getting so many similar shades like you
know what I'm saying so I'm frustrated
so I want to get your guys's thoughts
cuz when I mentioned this on Instagram a
lot of people are like wait what like I
didn't notice that I didn't see that so
have you guys heard about that have you
seen anything else about it you know
maybe I've missed something else
somewhere out there but clay play one
clay play too I mean done mystery
let's help solve it but let's go ahead
and give it a shot let's give it a try
I'm gonna use just the base powders out
of it and see what I think but I'm not
very happy about that well first up I'm
gonna pick up my Mota buffer brush and
I'm going to come into the bronzer which
is terracotta super bummed we didn't get
like a different bronzer and those
palette either so hmm hmm I'm just
feeling I'm just feeling a little
perturbed about this palette to be
honest and especially for a brand who is
as communicative with their you know
buyers as tart is there consistently on
snapchat they're consistently posting
YouTube videos and sharing tutorials and
sharing about new products etc etc like
I'm just really surprised that it was
like were you just trying to slip this
on us and think no one was going to
notice and I mean honestly I was not
going to be mad at this palette when I
thought I was getting new shades first
of all and just a new palette but having
it be the same names that feels lazy it
feels like someone dropped the ball
somewhere or someone decided to get lazy
you know that I was talking about it and
yes in Wednesday's will I buy a video
that it just feels like brands are in a
competition of who can release the most
stuff in the least amount of time and
that's really frustrating as a consumer
so then when you see something like this
it was like was this just a rush job and
something went wrong somewhere like it's
just very strange to me but then to have
so many repeat shades so many repeat
shades I mean come on you couldn't even
give us different shades I mean that's I
I can understand like maybe one of the
Matt Browns or something is the same but
what was what she say 7 out of 12 shades
were the same so basically every single
Matt shadow in here is the same except
for just these 3 shimmers and the bottom
row those are the ones that are
different and then the blush and
highlight are different like you kind of
give us different tones of browns and
grays I mean there's there's entire
palettes filled with 42 different shades
of Browns and you couldn't give us
different shades of brown so you gave us
the same ones like it just it's really
really rubbing me really rubbing me the
wrong way so I'm gonna place them to my
forehead as well I mean this is the same
bronzer from the clay play one and I
feel like it's applying the same looks
the same I really like this bronzer I do
like I was excited for the clay play to
like that's what I want to keep saying
like I was excited for it like new
shades you know I'm a highway like this
is gonna be awesome but when I realized
what it actually was I was like mm-hmm
really
I'm gonna grab out my Sigma f40 and I'm
going to dip into the blush shade which
is called desert and go ahead and apply
this I was always I want to hear your
thoughts I want I want to hear what you
think that tart was thinking with this
palette and do you do you guys think
it's not a big deal I don't know
let's not I'm gonna use the f-35 and dip
into this highlight I don't know is this
clutter there's a swatch of that well it
looks like glitter hmm yeah it's
glittery no I don't like glitter
highlights I mean if you like litter
highlights you probably don't like
that's fine but shoot
that's not really my vibe hmm hmm it
feels like when I put my finger in it to
swatch it it feels like really kind of
like chalky like like just kind of like
hard and like you can see kara can you
see on my brush like that's
that's that's like glitter that's mm-hmm
I don't like glitter highlights
particularly I've talked about that in
the past on my channel I just don't feel
like they really like flatter my skin
honestly cuz I was like you know if I
love the blush and the highlight maybe
it'll be okay my hair's always hurt
after a while but I was like maybe it'll
be okay and it'll be worth it but I
still like the clip play one as of right
now I mean I haven't tried the
eyeshadows out of this yet and I will I
still I still want to give it a fair
chance but I'm still just angry and
confused at this so I'll still try out
the eyeshadow so if anyone's got this
yet and you've tried it what do you
think about the blush what you think
both highlight what do you think with
eyeshadows but right now I'm just
feeling hmm
I'm just feeling not the happiest but
those are the bronzer blush and
highlight from the clay applied to on my
face okay so I just added a little bit
of black to my waterline I'm gonna come
back into the sassy Sienna's palette
like my favorite part of this video and
I'm gonna add some shades to my lower
lash line I think Oh first I'm gonna
come in with the first Brown that I use
and I'm gonna take the dose of colors
brush the pointy edge of it and I'm just
going to push that along the lower lash
line I'm gonna grab again the second
color and here and just kind of very
lightly blend that together I like I
have glitter in my hair I don't know if
you would be able to tell on camera oh
my gosh there's so much glitter in my
hair
oh no gonna be able to see it on camera
but there's so much glitter in my hair
I don't want glitter in my hair so
that's gonna finish off the eyes I feel
like star of the show this is sassy
Sienna's palette from dose of colors
again $32 which is bit pricier for only
five different shades but I really enjoy
how this eyelet came out it was super
simple like it doesn't take a lot to
blend it doesn't take a lot to pack on
the beautiful colors I'm very impressed
with this I'm super happy with it like I
said I've tried the marvelous mas
palette from them as well and it's
I mean the exact same quality as this
one really really happy with this one
and excited to come up with a few at
different looks from it but I just have
a lip color to finish off with and then
we'll be doing this video so I didn't
pick up my new lip color from that Ulta
purchase which is like a shocking but I
did get these sent to me actually from
octa Lee they are new lip glosses from
Lancome they're called the la absolutely
lost a sheer so they did send me four
different colors so I need to see which
one I wants to put on my lips these are
$25 on the Sephora website so I will
have them listed down below of course
though these are what the glasses look
like and these are the four colors that
I was sent along doesn't look like the
shade names are on the box but all I see
on here is like a numbers like this is
222 that's kind of bummer I wish the
shade names were on here but I think I'm
just gonna go with the latest one for
right now which this one is 222 and it
looks like it has a little bit of
sparkle in it but I'm gonna pop that on
and see what it looks like
so the gloss is a last year than I was
expecting a so I grabbed out one of my
favorite nudes from Mac this one is
called honey love and I just kind of
like how does look kind of dotted it
along I like how it looks a little bit
more glossy but I don't know I guess I
thought maybe it would be just a little
bit more pigmented but this one in the
222 this one is pretty sheer so it
looked good you know over top of a new
to give a bit of shine it does have just
a little bit of shimmer in there as well
bit of a scent too but one thing I
noticed right away is that it glided on
very smoothly and it doesn't seem sticky
at all which I really am NOT a fan of
sticky glosses so I liked that and I
liked this pairing just adding just a
tiny tiny hint of a light brown nude to
the lips so that is the color combo that
I use but then after that that is going
to do it for my mini alcohol try on sale
video okay so that is everything for
this video I hope you enjoyed seeing a
few new items that I picked up from Ulta
and also trying them on love the sassy
sianis palette super excited to keep
playing with it I love how the colors
came out I think it's beautiful the clay
play - I mean I'm just like really up in
the air about this I'll try it a couple
more times but the highlight appears to
be mostly glitter which is a
and then couple that with the fact that
I'm getting mostly the same the same
shades as the clay Playa one and it's
kind of like why would I keep this I
don't know of course let me know your
thoughts on this guy down below because
I think it's very intriguing I also it
really did like the Catrice a camouflage
a concealer I'm excited to keep giving
this a try Band kind of checking my
under eyes throughout the video and I
haven't noticed any creasing so far and
like I said it went on really nicely and
it blended out really easily so I will
definitely keep trying this one I love
that it's affordable because I feel like
my concealer collection has kind of been
leaning more towards high-end lightly
with like shaped tape Urban Decay Nick
it's can the cavern upon concealer that
I love so I'm excited to add in another
drugstore version but I'm just really
bummed at the shade selection because I
feel like that really does not a lot of
people a lot of good but if you guys did
like this kind of like haul Tryon video
let me know because sometimes you know I
don't place really big orders all of the
time sometimes I just want an item or
