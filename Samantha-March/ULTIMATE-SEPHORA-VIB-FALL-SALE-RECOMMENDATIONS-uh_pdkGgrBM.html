today's video is going to be my Sephora
vib sale recommendations video so the
highly awaited on sephora VIII IV sale
is coming up for fall of 2016 not have
the exact dates yet I haven't actually
received anything myself letting me know
the dates but I can put the dates in
here once I have it because I am Pre
filming this video to have it up around
the time as close to as I can that the
sale starts and then I will also leave
the dates in the description box below
and let you know when it starts for vib
rouge vib and then beauty insider
members so the Safari baby sale usually
happens about twice a year you get a
certain percentage off I will also leave
the percentages down below because they
usually vary between beauty insider vib
and vib rouge sometimes those
percentages are different do get a
percentage off of your entire support
order nothing is off limits here you can
get just the straight percentage off
your entire order when you check out
it's in stores and online it's an
excellent deal and it's a good way to
get makeup products that you've been
saving up for or maybe you have your
eyes on some of those more expensive
products and you haven't wanted to buy
them yet you might as well buy them at a
discount sephora really doesn't do any
other sales besides the vib sale so it's
a really big deal who take it very
seriously in the beauty community and I
think I've done one other of these
recommendations videos and I had a lot
of fun doing it it also helps me go
through my list and put everything
together for what I want to purchase
from the Sephora vib sale so i really
like doing this i have a very long list
for you guys i will try to get through
this as quickly as i can without having
to break it up into two parts so i
probably won't spend a ton of time on
each product but i just want to get
through everything as quickly as i can
i'll let you guys know what i plan on
purchasing myself to and what else I
just think is a hot item or product that
people are talking about that I think
you should buy when you have the
discount so without further ado why
don't we happen to my recommendations
for this for a vib fall sale brink
categories so first we're going to go
through like makeup essentials /
skincare so the first thing that I know
that I will be picking up from the
Sephora bab sale that I think is a great
time to pick up is a Beauty Blender so
you can buy just the regular beauty
blenders I have
nude beauty blender than I like there's
black beauty blenders but Beauty
blenders are expensive they usually run
twenty dollars so why not purchase it
when you have a discount because that's
expensive for a makeup sponge let's be
serious but also beauty blender has been
collabing with different makeup
companies and currently on the Sephora
website i found a Beauty Blender and
toothpaste collab and beauty blender and
benefit cosmetics collab both of these
sets are forty dollars and each set
comes with a beauty blender I believe
the bladder Rossi a and then also one
product each from that company so I
think to face has like a blush in there
and then benefits has the Porefessional
primer I think it is but i will leave
those sets down below so those are forty
dollars and you're getting a beauty
blender and then a few extras in there
as well so that could be something to
check out is an essential is the cinema
secrets makeup brush cleaner they have a
dry makeup brush cleaner I have it
myself a free purchased it several times
they have different sizes and the prices
vary from eight dollars all the way to
forty dollars I have bought the little
spray bottle and then I also by the big
juggs to refill my little spray bottle
because I take it with me what I travel
basically you just spray this on at
makeup brushes wipe them off they are
quick dry so they are not one at all you
can do this as you're applying your
eyeshadow and you only brought one
blending brush when you went traveling
but you want to use three different
eyeshadows you just spray it on wipe it
off on a paper towel and you can go
right into your next eyeshadow you don't
have to worry about your brush being wet
or anything like that it's amazing I've
repurchase it several times highly
recommend cinema secrets I have in my
current beg right now it is the tart
pack your bags the under-eye rescue
patches I have heard so many good things
about these and I and I have recently
become very obsessed with like under
iPads I think they are amazing and do
great things they were part of my
morning routine for so long until I ran
out of my current pair and I was like no
but everyone says really good things
about they start once they're $22 and
you get a four of them so i will
probably purchasing at least one if not
two sets during the sale he is one of my
favorite skincare brands and you can get
this at sephora i have recently run out
of my cleanser from first aid beauty i
once again am almost out of my facial
radiance pad
which are phenomenal I always always
always need these in my collection first
day beauty also has a ton of different
really cool looking kids available on
sephora right now that's usually the way
that I go is love buying sets that's
actually how I first tried out first a
beauty was I bought a set from them I
think it was during one of those before
a vib sales and I just became instantly
hooked they have a one-set called the
boutique first day beauty said I think
it is it comes with the ultra Repair
Cream which I need more of it comes with
the hydrating serum which I haven't
tried yet it also comes with the face
cleanser which I need I ran out of the
facial radiance path I need visual
radiance pads are key and it also comes
with the ultra Repair intensive lip balm
which I haven't tried yet myself and you
can get all of that for forty-eight
dollars right now that's the one in my
cart but they also have a lot of other
good ones though I believe as many
linked it down below as I can but if you
haven't checked out first day beauty yet
or if you need to restock on some
favorites the sale is a great time to do
that very very curious to get and it has
been in my loves us for a long time is
from Tarte and it's their friction
exfoliating stick I am super curious
about this and I see that a lot of
people have liked it it's $22 and I'm
definitely going to be purchasing this
during the vib sale because I think it
looks super cool can't wait to try it a
glam glow I just happen to think they
are very very expensive so to buy the
products during a sale is a great time I
have tried the glam glow hydrating
treatment i think it is it's the blue
one also recently tried the super mud
one as well and i really really like
that i think i had a sample of the super
mud and i really want to purchase at
least the little bottle which i think is
nineteen dollars versus the hit big huge
bottle which i believe is 68 the little
bottles really do last me a long time
but if you're a big fan of Glanville or
even wanted to try them out try not
during the sale we're going to have over
into the face now so one of my favorite
high-end foundations that i purchased
from sephora during the last VIP sale
was the clinic beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer it's $27 I
think it's amazing it's full coverage
but still lightweight on the skin I
recommend it all the time I just had my
friend Sheen and pick it up for her
engagement photos and also for her
wedding and she loves it as well just a
that I recommend to everybody so if you
haven't tried it out yet the clinic one
is a good one to grab right now is stick
foundations the anastacio Beverly Hills
a stick foundation is a fairly newer
release they are twenty-five dollars
each I do have one I think it's a nice
foundation it's not my favorite but a
lot of people really like it they have a
huge variety of colors and some people
are using the Assad only s foundations
concealers and as bronzers there's a lot
of different options that you can do
with them and at $25 not a terrible
price foundation that is super super
popular is from make up forever it's
their ultra HD in a visible cover stick
foundation is $43 I personally would
really like to try this one out myself
just because I've heard so many good
things about it I've seen it out of
stock quite a bit but as I'm doing my
research today and putting it together
this video it is in stock so that could
be one to check out fitting a lot of
hype is from our glass and it is their
vanish seamless finish foundation stick
and it's forty six dollars I've just
been hearing a lot of good things about
it I've been hearing that is a full
coverage of foundation as well I haven't
tried it myself I don't know if I would
pick it up I think I would rather do the
make up for ever one versus this one but
I know it's been getting a lot of pipes
so if you've been thinking about picking
it up pick it up at a discount
concealers to talk about Kat Von D
recently came out with the locket
concealer this is one that I've been
hearing pretty mixed reviews on but for
some reason I still want to try it
myself I don't know why that is what
I've just been gravitating towards it
right now it is in my cart will see how
I feel once I actually start checking
out and adding up the total I don't want
to do that but this one is twenty-six
dollars new face also has the Born This
Way concealer I haven't tried the
foundation or the concealer but I'm
interested in trying out the concealer
it is twenty-eight dollars so right now
I have both Kat Von D and toothpaste on
my cart will I purchase them both well I
not purchase either of them I don't know
but right now those are the two that I'm
interested in one like blush and bronzer
palette that I have had my eye on since
it came out and I just haven't been able
to purchase it yeah because I think it's
kind of pricey is the
athan palette from Benefit Cosmetics so
it's $58 but inside you get a
combinations of blush and bronzers so
inside there is the Dallas dandelion
corrilesa racket or and then the hula
matte bronzer so it was kind of like all
of their like best sellers are very well
known blushes / bronzers and they put
them all in one and then it also does
include like the little benefit brush
that comes in a lot of their sets as
well the hoola bronzer is absolutely
amazing I really do like the dandelion I
own that as well but I don't all the
other ones so I really have been
thinking about getting this palette and
I still see a lot of people use it like
i said it's $58 so this could be a good
time to purchase it blush everybody
seems to love the tart blushes I
actually don't own any of the
individuals myself but I do have a tart
blush in the style by her uche palette
from Tarte cosmetics and I really love
it the tower blushes are a little bit
more pricey so a sale is a good time to
buy them or they also do have like the
big old tarts blush wheel forty four
dollars and it has eight different
shades in there I think for one tart
blush it's in the 20s maybe like
twenty-six dollars are so so the blushes
inside aren't quite as big as the you
know full-size regular one but if you
put them all together I can get said it
was like a one hundred and fifty dollar
value and you'll get it for forty four
dollars so if you're big blush fans or
big fans of the tart blushes this big ol
blush wheel I think would be pretty cool
forget highlighters of course everybody
loves on especi of Beverly Hills and her
glow kit I do too I own that glow and
then I also own sweets I think they are
amazing most of the glow kids are forty
dollars there are some variances because
she has the ultimate glow kits that is
out and then also the moonchild loken I
believe both of those are a little bit
more pricey than her regular glow kits
but still a really great time to
purchase them like i said i have that
glow and i have sweets i would recommend
them both i really do like them
moonchild has been getting a lot of hype
and of course the ultimate glow kit that
is a new like holiday release and people
are kind of going bananas for that so
the glow kids are a good one to check
out during the sale I've been talking
about milk cause
lately I'm hearing more and more about
milk cosmetics but they came out with
the holographic stick and people kind of
also lost their minds over this as well
I saw so many videos dedicated to just
this holographic stick but basically
it's like a highlighter and it's
supposed to be a holographic highlighter
now some people have said this is the
coolest thing I've ever seen and it
works so well I've also some seen some
people get it and they're like this
doesn't even do anything it doesn't even
highlight there's nothing to it I don't
know I'm pretty curious about it its
twenty eight dollars like I kind of want
to get it for myself just to see if it
actually does work because the people
that I have seen that it does work for
them it looks really cool so I don't
know this could be a good time to
purchase something that you're like not
totally sure on but don't want to try it
out try it out when you get a discount
you know a touch on is a from marc
jacobs it's their glow stick highlighter
I actually own this and I recommend it
all the time I received it from an
influenster box because it's $42 and I
was like I don't know if I really like
it like I don't know if I get it has
gold and silver in it it's supposed to
be like the universal highlight I don't
know so I got it sent to me from
Influenster and i was like i love this
highlighter I love this highlighter when
I first got it I was obsessed with it it
was about the only highlight that I wore
I think it is so pretty so stunning so
even though it is $42 the VIP sale is a
really good time to make that purchase
because it's actually a really
phenomenal highlighter let's jump over
to the eyes so the first one that I'm
really excited to see is still in stock
I don't know if it's gonna last until
the sale but it's the modern renaissance
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills
it's a $42 eyeshadow palette and I have
wanted this for so long i actually
purchased it from Ulta online and I
don't know what happened it was
available i bought it i was charged for
it and then when the rest of my all to
order shipped i got an a note at the
very bottom and said this product is
actually out of stock so i was refunded
my money but i was like no what is it
wasn't happening here like i just bought
this palette why is this so hard so that
one is definitely in my cart right now I
really hope I can get it let's see if it
stays available through the sale other
palette
is the kat von d metal matte eyeshadow
palette this is a sixty-dollar palette
and a new palette from kat von d so i
recently mentioned this in my previous
will i buy it video and i actually said
that I was not going to buy it and I
knew I was going to make a lot of people
mad when I said I wasn't going to buy
that palette because those who have the
palette and who like it they don't just
like it they love it and they're very
passionate about it so I got a lot of
comments and they're like I love this
palette how do you not want this palette
it's an amazing palette and I'm like I'm
sorry I knew I was gonna make you guys
mad I knew it I almost like I considered
not putting it in there cuz i was like
people are gonna hate me for this one
and they sure did I still am NOT going
to purchase it myself for the reasons
that I list in my will i buy a video
which i will leave link down below but i
know a lot of people really excited
about this palette it is a little bit
more expensive at sixty dollars so
purchase it during the sale for the
discount I wanted to recommend is the
tart pretty paint box this is the part
of their holiday collection it's $59 and
you are getting a lot of product I think
I mentioned this may be in my one of my
previous will i buy it and I said that I
wasn't going to buy it mostly just
because of the price and the timing
being really bad what the holidays
around the corner I actually just closed
a business I have book releases coming
out like I just have a lot going on
right now so I can't just be spending a
lot of money towards makeup products but
now that the sale is going to be here
and I will have a percentage off I'm
going to reconsider getting the paint
box just because you get a lot in it and
I have seemed pretty good review so far
if anybody did get the paint box please
do leave it in the comments down below
because I would love to know your
opinions as well before I do purchase
this but basically in the pink bag
getting mascara blushes highlighters
bronzers are shadows a eyeliner the
TARDIS glossy lip paint I mean it's a
really big set that you're getting with
a lot of different products in there so
I was really excited to see it when i
saw that come out and their holiday
release $59 I don't think is a bad price
either so this is fun that I'm really
really considering getting again if
you've gotten it please leave it in the
comments below what you think of it a
touch on is one that I'm very curious
myself I have it in my cart right now
and I really do want to get it it's from
the company touch in Seoul I've
purchase anything from them before what
it is they're metallic liquid foil and
glitter eye shadow duel so basically one
then you have like your metallic
eyeshadow and then on the other end you
have more of a glitter of a couple of
different colors I've seen Babs Beauty
talk about this I've seen Nikki
tutorials talk about it and they seemed
really happy with it it's $25 if I
haven't said that yet but I'm really
curious about this from what I've seen
people using it it looks really nice and
again it's a company that I've never
tried before I like finding new
companies to try out from so this is one
that I have on my list right now another
one that is in my love's list right now
is from urban decay and it is their
liquid moon dust cream eyeshadow so
Urban Decay came out with the moon does
palette not too long ago and it looked
like amazing like very sparkly glittery
eyeshadow palette looked a like a lot of
fun and a lot of people got excited
about it also released these like cream
eyeshadows and people have been really
excited not only not only about the
eyeshadows but they also came out with
like glitter liners people are really
really excited for these so the cream
eyeshadows are $22 each they have about
seven or eight different colors i think
is what I'm seeing and they look like a
lot of fun I just think this would be
really good to have if you kind of want
that like fun pop of color pop of
glitter I've been seeing the swatches of
them and people using my tutorials they
look really cool it's not something that
I normally would gravitate towards
because it's not something that I would
do for like an everyday look but when
there's a sale when you get a discount
like good time to buy something that you
know that you're not going to use on the
everyday and save a little bit of money
touch on eyebrows real quick because we
all know you know getting into my
eyebrow game slowly but surely so I want
to talk about from benefit they have
recently released these eyebrow kids and
they are phenomenal I've already
mentioned them in my favorites video I
have the soft and natural kit it comes
with the goof proof pencil which is
absolutely amazing it comes with a ready
set bro i think it is which is like the
clear brow gel and then it also comes
with the high bro which is amazing they
have three different kids and they're
all at thirty four dollars so i suggest
looking at all what's inside the
different kits they have different
things for based on what you need for
your eyebrows but if they come and your
color because not
Rick it comes in all of the different
shades if they come in near shade and
you need what's inside they are actually
a really good deal like i said i have
the soft and natural i think it's
amazing they're all at thirty four
dollars and i love mine everybody loves
the bra is from anastacio beverly hills
it's $21 I've never tried it myself I'm
kind of a little intimidated by the brow
with because I'm so new to browse like
the goof proof was like a huge step for
me but maybe someday I'll get into the
brow is but if you want to try it or if
you need another brow is if you've run
out of yours I $21 get a discount
winning the last thing for eyes is of
course eyelashes I really do like the
hooter beauty eyelashes I have mine in
the style Samantha and they're like on
their last limb so I would like to get
another pair during the sale and then
also pick up another pair I'm not sure
which one I want the most I kind of got
a look around at them and I might go
into sephora and actually like a look at
the lashes and see which one I think
would be best if you have any huda
lashes that you would recommend let me
know what style down below there are
twenty dollars so i think picking them
up during the sale is a great time to do
it and we are winding down we just have
lips lift to talk about let's do it oh
so the first one that i want to
recommend is the always-on map with
lipsticks from Smashbox cosmetics this
is an amazing formula I have been so
impressed I have tried stepping out
which is a brown shade and then also
dream huge which is like a brighter pink
both are amazing colors I love the
colors especially stepping out for the
fall but also the formula is amazing I
cannot stop recommending these there are
twenty four dollars a piece i'll
probably pick up at least one more shade
during the sale because i love that
formula they came out with a set
recently it's the everlasting mini
liquid lipstick set it comes with eight
of the mini everlasting liquid lipsticks
and it is a forty nine dollars for all
eight minutes this would be a really
good option if you know that you love
the kat von d everlasting liquid
lipsticks or if you have wanted to try
them you haven't tried them out yet or
if you want to try different colors but
you don't want to purchase the full size
of them because include it in this set
is they feel like of the deeper darker
colors like the dark blue and the dark
purple and that sort of thing so if you
think you
want that color in your collection but
you don't necessarily want to pay for
the full price of this this set could be
a good option pretty curious about this
but not too long ago I picked LZ sephora
give me some lip collection and I
thought it was amazing it came with one
of the Smashbox liquid lipsticks in
there and it was just such an awesome
lip said it featured mostly like nude
lip ease in there it was twenty eight
dollars and I thought it was so worth it
it sold out so fast but the day that I'm
working on this video it's there it's
for sale it let me add it to my cart if
it's still for sale during the vib sale
pick it up this that was so good
everybody was loving on it I watched so
many videos about it people were really
really happy with this set like I said
its twenty eight dollars i think you get
six different lippies for our minis but
you get a full-size of the smashbox
liquid lipstick which is twenty eight
dollars and you also get a full size of
the lancome juicy shaker which i also
definitely recommend for you guys I love
my Lancome juicy shaker it comes in the
shade boomerang I think or something
like that in the set and it's been
amazing I've been addicted to it i've
mentioned in a favorites video that's
another one you could consider picking
up or you could just get it in this set
and save some money it's a good one but
they also have a give me some lip bold
so it's like the same concept but the
regular give me some lip was mostly
nudes and this one is like the deeper
darker bolder colors and that's also $28
i believe so i will leave both of those
linked down below the sephora favorite
sets are really really good but they do
sell out fast familiar with bite beauty
I don't think I've really ever tried
anything from them besides maybe like a
few like really small samples here and
there but a lot of people talk about
their amuse-bouche lipsticks I think
it's how you pronounce them so I have
them on my love's list right now and i'm
considering checking them out so one
lipstick is twenty-six dollars are they
also do have a trio set out right now so
you get three minis and it's $25 so i
have both of them currently in my love's
list that i want to take a little bit
closer look at has anyone tried these
bites beauty Lippi's let me know what
you think down the comments below but
i'm kind of a lipstick junkie so i'm
always looking for more lipsticks to try
and do companies to try them from the
fine
product is a recommendation from Jaclyn
hill she talks about this all the time
and I've always been kind of curious to
finally get it and see what I think
about it and I think getting it during
the vib sale would be a good time
because it's from March it goes so you
know it's going to be a little bit more
pricier but it is the high shine gloss
lip lacquer lip gloss okay so it's a lip
gloss well just it's the lip gloss but
it is twenty-eight dollars and she
always recommends the one and sugar
sugar I believe she mentioned this in
her ride or die video she just talks
about the sugar sugar lip gloss all the
time says it's one of the best as I pull
it up on Sephora it actually has the
little like winner of an allure beauty
award next to it so I'm like people
really like it too it's on my love list
right now let me know of course do you
guys have it do you recommend it do you
recommend spending twenty eight dollars
on a lip gloss like I think it's
expensive to spend twenty dollars on a
liquid lipstick and now I'm going to
spend twenty eight on a lip gloss I
don't know but I figure if I'm gonna go
for it I'm gonna go for it when I get a
discount be everything for my Sephora
vib sale fall a recommendation oh my
