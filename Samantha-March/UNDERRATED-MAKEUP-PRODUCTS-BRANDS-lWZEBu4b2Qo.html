number or my hair but it's been hot all
day from the face I take it down to me
like this large sums rolling with it I
feel like my butt is being cut off and
for you can i buy and sell I just hire a
little early but yeah what okay okay
buddy thank you for watching so today's
video is going to be all about under
rated makeup and beauty products this
was actually a video that was requested
a couple videos back and I saw it almost
like that's a good idea i really like
watching those types of videos on
youtube too because it's interesting to
see there's always that like really
hyped up a makeup products that
everybody wants and everybody is talking
about but then there's so many other
gems that it seems like never get any
love or attention so once i saw that
comment requesting the video i went
through my makeup collection was like I
don't feel like enough people talk about
this I don't feel like it enough people
talk about this so I have makeup I have
brushes I have skincare and I'm really
excited to share some of my favorite
products with you that I don't feel like
get enough love here on YouTube so if
you would like to see my top underrated
makeup and beauty products please keep
watching from pure cosmetics and this is
one that I mentioned in my ride-or-die
makeup tag so you guys should know that
I really really love this product it is
therefore in one pressed mineral powder
so that's the packaging looks like and
then when you open it up you do have a
mirror and then you're pressed powder
right here I'm almost out of this one
I've just got sent another one and I'm
very excited about it because it has
been my go-to powder foundation for so
many years I mean five years plus
probably more like eight years but this
has just been my favorite powder
foundation and I honestly don't feel
like pure cosmetics gets talked about
enough they have some really really
fantastic products out there and it's
just it's not like a super hyped up
brand I don't think in my opinion but I
really hear people talk about the
foreign one pressed powder and when I do
I'm just like hey that's my favorite
powder like I'm like letting everybody
know that this is like my go-to powder
so yeah I definitely wanted to give a
shout out to this it's just been a
staple of mine for so long next product
I have two from sigma and these were
both sent to me from sigma beauty when i
became
and affiliate with them and I was so
excited to receive these and once I did
and once I tried him out I was like wait
a second why does that more people talk
about these these are awesome so their
first one is their core DeRosa or a
powder so this is what that looks like
and this is what it looks like when you
open it up so you have your mirror and
then you have your blush right here this
blush is so super pigmented and it's
really funny because today I was
watching desi Perkins do her like purple
grunge look and she used the score
DeRosa powder in it and it was like I
didn't realize like how pigmented that
blush was like she had to like kind of
tone it down with her foundation brush
but it is that maybe it might not look
like anything like super special or
super crazy but this is a really really
fantastic blush you just need a very
light hand it goes on so well super
pigmented and is very very long-lasting
I was so impressed with this definitely
one that I think needs more love and the
other product from Sigma that I want to
talk about is there in spades power
lipstick so this is what the lipstick
too but looks like and it's very like
heavy like when I pulled it out I was
like okay to hang and then this is what
the lipstick looks like so it is the
lipstick that I'm wearing today so it's
a really nice pink color with a nice
gloss to it and I think it's fun because
it also i don't know if you can see that
on the camera but it says sigma on the
side of the lipstick as well and i'm not
going to lie like sigma sent via their
package i got all excited over the
brushes i got all excited over the
winged liner and then i finally tried
the blush and i was like dang that was
an awesome blush and then even later
than that I tried the lipstick and I was
like wait a second that lipstick is
amazing not only do I think it's a
really pretty color but you know it
feels like a regular lipstick on the
lips it doesn't feel like a liquid
lipstick it's not drying to the lips it
doesn't do any weird flaking things but
the pigmentation and the long-lasting of
this lipstick is phenomenal it truly
reminds me more of like a liquid
lipstick or maybe like the ultra statins
from colour-pop where it stays on so
long throughout meals it doesn't look
crazy after a few hours of where it
feels like a regular lipstick on the
lips it's so awesome i love it i was so
happy and so impressed when i first
tried it and then I was
gris myself for not trying it sooner but
I've been rushing mething this a lot
lately Sigma in spades power lipstick
gets my approval dan colour-pop I wanted
to touch on a few items from them but i
really love I feel like color pop is
known really well for their super shock
eyeshadows and known really well for
like their lippies the the lippie Stix
the ultra matte that ultra statins but
the two products that i want to touch on
one I feel like no one should be
surprised about because I try to talk
about these as much as I can but it is
their cream gel liners and again as I
say every time I talk about these
colour-pop has cream gel liners and they
have liners in the platform and I say
stay away from those I've tried them I
don't think there are any good the
pencil liners are phenomenal I keep
buying them i will keep continuing to
buy them I think these are five dollars
they're either five dollars or six hours
super super affordable they have a huge
range of colors I think they're
fantastic but the long-lasting of these
guys are crazy even at the end of the
day where I've worn it for a full day
and I take my makeup off I have to go
back in with a makeup wipe and remove
this eyeliner because that is how much
it stays on even if you splash your face
with water and you're rubbing your hands
around this is still not going to come
off your eyes it's crazy I love the
different colors of them I love helping
meant that they are I think they're
phenomenal and I think more people
should talk about them because they are
so awesome and the other item from
colour-pop that I want to talk about is
actually one of the first items that I
ever order from colour-pop I did not
order their eyeshadows right away but
one of the first things that I ordered
was there blushes and their blushes are
actually really good the two shades that
I have are in quarters in between the
sheets quarters was like my go-to blush
last year in the fall and winter it is
such a beautiful like coral color but
it's a little bit deeper than just like
a basic coral I just thought like I
could not stop wearing it in the fall
and winter and it pairs so well with so
many different looks and I just I just
love their blushes that I picked up was
between the sheets which is like the
really pretty like everyday kind of pink
color and you can tell like I I really
used that one I can't believe I haven't
hit pan
on it yet but I feel like any time now
I'm gonna hit pan on it but I was just
really impressed with the colour-pop
blushes when I first got him I could not
stop using them I definitely suggest
these with like a duo fiber brush if you
use like a regular blush brush you're
probably not going to really get
anything out of them but I actually went
out and bought my very first duo fiber
brush to use with these color pop
blushes and I think it worked phenomenal
these are eight dollars i believe so
still super affordable and they are a
bigger pan as well then like the
eyeshadow that you get from colour-pop
some brushes that i want to talk about i
did mention these i think it was in my
back to school essentials video but they
are at the brushes from bhcosmetics so
BH Cosmetics is a super affordable brand
that you can buy online at their website
but they are not only just affordable
too but they do have a really good
quality items and the bh brushes for
some of the very first brushes that i
ever ordered when i started seriously
getting into makeup and i actually
ordered brush sets and the brush set i
thought were really really amazing
because not only are you getting a huge
line of brushes for a good price but
you're also getting like a brush case so
i'll use these brush cases for like when
i'm traveling and I can put 12 to 20
brushes in these cases and then take
them with me like when we go out of town
on vacation which I thought was really
awesome but they really do have nice
brushes and the one brush that I use
constantly and everyone when I first
started going to make up and I said what
do I need when it comes to brushes i was
recommended a good foundation brush and
I was also recommended a good blending
brush for eyeshadows so this is a brush
that I actually bought individually I
did not purchase this one in a set it is
just they're blending brush this was my
only blending brush for nearly my first
year of really getting into makeup and
probably like my first six months or so
on YouTube it is a fantastic blending
brush I actually used it today for my
look I still use it even though i have
like other blending brushes now it's one
that i keep going back to this was a
very good brush but i've also been
really really happy with the sets that
I've gotten I'm not going to say that
I've loved every single brush out of
every single set but that's kind of what
you get when you purchase a set I can't
say with every single makeup brush set
that I purchased I've been like I'm in
love with iverson go one of them but the
majority of the bh brushes I've been
really happy
an eyeliner that I want to talk about is
one that I again I don't feel like I
hear anybody else talk about this a lot
of times i buy makeup products because I
see them being recommended on YouTube
this one did not get recommended I just
happened to see this product at a CVS
and I was like okay I'm gonna buy it and
you guys say we use it in so many
different makeup tutorials but it is the
Maybelline master precise liquid liner I
have this on my eyes today I think it is
such a phenomenal eyeliner this is what
it looks like and actually I think I'm
starting to finally run out I had this
for so long and I use it nearly on the
daily and as I was applying it today I
was like oh no am i running out because
I'm gonna have to go repurchase this
because I absolutely love it it was one
that was mentioned in my ride or dies
because I'm a big big eyeliner junkie
and I always got to have my eyeliner
going on so I'm definitely gonna pick up
a new one of these if I really am
running out of it but I just think it is
so good especially for a winged liner I
was still very very new at doing winged
liner it was a product that I picked up
again not on a recommendation I just
happened to see that CVS and I was like
I'll give it a shot and I ended up
really really liking it it's a very
black and has that super precise tip but
it's more firm than like the NYC liquid
liner which I just feel like goes all
over the place and there's a giant mess
this I felt was very very easy to get
the winged liner I love how black it is
and how long lasting it is and more
people need this there's just a few more
products left another one is a blush and
this is from when wild it's their color
icon hombre blush so this is what it
looks like and I have the one in at
might I buy you a drink it is a
beautiful peachy shimmery bronze II
blush it actually really reminds me of
luminoso from Milani which is that blush
is clearly super hyped about like
YouTube made me buy that blush because
everybody said I needed that everybody
talks about it everybody loves it I feel
like wet and wild gets talked a lot for
their like third color icons their trios
like walking on eggshells i think is a
really popular one there are
highlighters i know everybody was going
crazy for but i haven't heard a lot of
people talk about this blush and i think
it's amazing when i first bought it i
could not stop using it like ice
if you have luminosa from Milani you
probably don't need this one but there
are different shades in the ombre blush
I really like about this blush too is
it's almost kind of like a 211 and I say
the same thing about Luminoso because of
the shimmer in it but when you apply it
it looks like a blush but then it also
gives you shimmer on your highlight
points as well so it almost is kind of
like acting as a 211 so days where I'm
really in a rush and I'm like trying to
skip steps it kind of lets me skip the
highlighter step because it still kind
of looks like I've highlight on with
this blush so I really appreciate that
but I thought these blushes were very
very nice I don't feel like I hear a lot
of people talk about them and they're
affordable as well so I would check out
the wet and wild blushes if you're
looking for a new one so some skincare
that I want to talk about is from the
Garnier skin active line I have a couple
projects right here that I just grabbed
out of my bathroom but i have been using
the Garnier skincare for years and it's
some of my favorite it's also affordable
which is really nice but one of my
favorite products is the ultralift
miracle wake up cream they're all day
hydration is basically a moisturizer I
mean once once we get through all of
that it's a facial moisturizer and says
it's made with hydrogel and I love
Garnier's moisturizers I have this one I
have ones that come more in like a pop
form and is also another gel moisturizer
I have been using them for years and
years and years and I just love them so
much so this is what i use basically
every single morning but what i use at
night is there ultra lift miracle
sleeping cream so this is what that
looks like i have been using this for a
couple months straight nearly every
single night this is what i'm using on
my face as a sleeping cream it pretty
much replaced my first date beauty
sleeping cream which really shocked me
but this is what the inside of it looks
like I do have a bit of a dent in there
but I think it smells so nice it smells
really calming and I struggle with
sleeping because my mind is always going
like a million miles a minute the sense
that it has is very like calming and
relaxing to me so I feel like it
actually can kind of help me sleep and
like set on my mind which is really nice
but I don't hear really anybody I feel
like talk about the garden
skin active liner garne skin care in
general we have all these like fancy
brands out there that everyone is
talking about and using but while i do
like certain like higher end brands I
always find myself going back to Garnett
skin active last thing that I want to
talk about is actually nails so I have
done a full video on like the fake nails
that I wear but I thought I would
mention it in here because I really
don't hear a lot of people talk about
this brand but it is called nail her so
actually I was introduced to nail her
from Nicole Guerrero she did like a
collaboration with nail hurt that's how
I heard about it but then I started to
notice that I really didn't hear about
it from anyone else a lot of be like
bigger youtubers and that sort of thing
they basically have the acrylic nails
which I don't have yet I've been
thinking about getting them recently but
for the time being what works out really
well for me are these nail her nails and
they're really affordable and I can do
them myself at home and I've been
wearing them so much I think I've been
wearing them since March and either
march in February I've gotten really
good at putting them on it takes me
probably less than five minutes now and
so it's really easy and I like being
able to switch it up but these are what
the boxes look like decide you get 24
nails that are 12 different sizes you
get a nail file and a nail glue in each
one what really impresses me about these
nails is how long they stay on mine stay
on for at least two weeks without
anything falling off and that's me you
know showering like a regular person and
doing dishes and typing on the computer
and everything like opening pop cans
like things that I would be afraid of
when I had acrylic nails but these nails
stay on so long it's really amazing like
actually sometimes I can have troubles
getting them off and I have to be like
soaking them in hot water or a lot of
times I take them off in my shower and
let them soak in the hot water and steam
in there for a while before I take them
off but their glue is no joke I promise
you a little bit will go a long way but
I like it because they have a lot of
different styles wearing right now is
the square but they also have the other
box that grabbed out is stiletto and I
don't know if you can see that that's
like the sharp pointed nails but they
also have squaw leto which is kind of
like in between a square and
stiletto and then they also have oval I
have tried every single one out the only
ones that I don't particularly love is
the stiletto because it's too hard for
me to type on the computer that's
basically what I do all day but every
other type of nail I really love and I
actually really do enjoy the squall at 0
which are longer but it's still not hard
for me to type on the computer but I
ended up really liking that and I feel
like it makes the hands like very like
feminine really really like them but
what's cool about these is that I have a
huge jar of nail polish because I've
always just painted my own nails can
paint over the nail her nails like this
what I have on my nails right now is
like a Sally Hansen gel polish if the
nails don't have like 3d designs on them
or glitter or anything like that you can
paint over the nails and then take them
off take off that polish with a regular
nail polish remover and repainted or you
can leave the designs on it that they
come with if you want but I think that's
really really cool but if you just keep
changing up your nails if that's what
you want to do so i oftentimes will just
end up painting them myself and as
someone who hasn't wanted to pull the
trigger yet of getting acrylic nails
like i said i'm thinking about it but
for this time being these nail her nails
are doing awesome for me I think it's
like twelve or thirteen dollars for a
set you can also reuse them quite a bit
i think i am on number 10 with these
square nails they say you can reuse them
up to 40 x 40 i feel like is a bit of a
stretch because i can tell with each
time that I put them on it gets a little
bit tougher because the glue is really
hard to get off the nails so you kind of
like have a layer of glue that's really
hard to get off so I would say maybe
like 15 to 20 reuses which still is a
lot especially for how affordable they
are and I also do have a discount code
with them use the code Samantha March
and get ten percent off so if you want
to try them and see if they are for you
like I said it's just really easy for me
to put them on and then take them off
paint the nails and I just haven't
decided yet if I want to get the
acrylics if I want to do that to my
nails and have the upkeep with it so in
the meantime if I still want to have
nice looking nails for YouTube or for
photos the nail her nails are really
coming in handy I really feel like I
don't hear a lot of people talk about it
probably because they have the night
acrylic nails but yeah if you're like me
and looking for something kind of like
in between I definitely do suggest nail
her everything for my under rated makeup
products I really hope that you guys
