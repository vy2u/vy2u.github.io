today's video I'm so excited to do
because it's going to be a tag video and
it's also gonna be a collab video so
exciting day today so the tag video that
I'm going to be doing is the underrated
overrated makeup tag this was started by
my friend Georgia Harris and she
actually did in collaboration with
biohazardous beauty I'll have both of
their videos down below but basically
they came up with a bunch of different
categories of for makeup brands products
etc and we have to go through and pick
out what one we think is super
underrated and what wouldn't we think is
super overwrite it and here's actually
really hard to make this list but I'm
also really excited because this video
is going to be in collaboration with my
friend every day hiding over here on
YouTube and I am so excited to collab
with her we've been talking about
clogging for a while and honestly it's
so hard to come up with collab ideas we
were talking back and forth for a while
and then Georgia and biohazardous Beauty
came out with this video and we were
like yes let's do it
so I of course will have Heidi's channel
linked down below and make sure to go
check her out I'm really curious to see
what she came up with her her her list
because like I was a little bit
challenging but she has a great channel
she's so much fun to watch it she has so
much energy
you can tell that she really loves
creating her videos it's different from
me her videos are usually like short and
to the point
remind her a little bit longer and
rambling can you tell what this intro uh
but she also creates a lot of content
and she just has so many good videos
over there lots of fun review videos and
she comes up with a ton of fun makeup
look so make sure to go over there check
out her channel let her know I sent you
if you're coming from Heidi's channel
welcome thank you so much for coming I
do post a video every single day if not
six days a week sometimes I take a
Saturday off but other than that I post
a lot of videos over here and I love to
do this chat about makeup so if you want
to see my underrated overrated makeup
tag want me go ahead and get started so
we have quite a few categories to get
through so I'll try to get through this
as quickly as I can I'm also filming a
little bit later because it's the second
video because I'm pre filming cuz I'll
be out of town and it's not the Sun it's
not starting to set but the lighting is
starting to shift so I apologize that
looks crazy okay
so first off just like Georgia did in
her video and overrated doesn't
necessarily mean that it's a
that product or I don't like it you know
there's gonna be things on my list
really I like it but it definitely was
overrated or maybe it wasn't maybe it
wasn't worth the overrated nough sand my
mind that type of thing and then
underrated doesn't mean that like nobody
likes it or it's like the best product
in the entire world type of thing but
maybe I don't feel like it got enough
chatter about you know things like that
so just gonna throw that out there but
we kick it off with makeup brands just
in general makeup brands to me an
underrated makeup brand is a newer brand
but I'm still just like I'm someone
who's really excited about this brand so
I wanted to give them a mention and it's
lawless beauty so again it's a new brand
and it was a founded by Andy lawless who
is absolutely beautiful I follow her
like everywhere and every time she like
snaps it really does anything with our
life I'm like nah so they first launched
their liquid lipsticks which I
absolutely love baking of liquid
lipsticks continually recommend them and
they also just launched a foundation
which I am still planning and to pick up
from Sephora so again newer brands they
don't have a ton of products out yet but
I definitely am excited to see where the
brand's going how they're gonna expand
and I think it's one of those brands to
watch you know what I'm saying so you
feel like they're probably underrated
because they're so new but it's really
exciting that she got into Sephora
that's awesome and I also think she's
gonna be a brand to watch they're gonna
be a brand to watch Louis Beauty
overrated
honestly the first brand that came into
my head was Kylie cosmetics uh man you
know I just remember all the craziness
when Kylie cosmetics first came out you
know product selling in like 16 seconds
and you know all having to wait in line
as you were trying to you know check out
with your order and all of that you know
a lot of it was happening because of her
name because of who she is and I totally
get that I totally understand that but
at the same time I just kind of wanted
to like can we just calm down for a
second
like she's I think what frustrated me in
the beginning try makes us quick I think
what frustrated me was that people were
buying and selling out and making this
girl's a millionaire so quickly without
really anything to stand on without
anything to go on like you know what I'm
saying and that to me was what kind of
frustrated me was we don't even know if
these products are good yet we don't
even know how the customer services we
don't even know how any of this is
except it was just ah because of her
being a celebrity and you know her name
and so I felt like that was pretty
overrated especially in the beginning I
feel like maybe the hype has died down
like ish ish but uh definitely in the
beginning though for Kylie cosmetics
okay so next up was a makeup brand
collab so like if I make a brand
collabed with another person and
influence or etc so for underrated
honestly I kind of thought of the Urban
Decay and Kristen LeAnn collaboration I
felt like it didn't get a ton a ton of
hype associated as Kristin Leone is a
really big youtuber and I know the club
went on sale right away which you know I
think Urban Decay just does that in
general but I was like do people not
like the products or what but this
palette in particular I really enjoyed
it's called the Beauty beam highlight
palette so it looks like this you have
three different shades you have a mirror
I love this palette I think it is so
good I just this on one of my trips with
me I can't remember maybe it was my
Arizona trip I took with me and I just
really enjoyed this palette I liked all
three shades in there I think they're
really stunning I thought this was a
really nice highlight palette I feel
like I didn't hear anybody talking about
it or see anybody using it and I was
like but and then for overrated so I
thought of NYX Cosmetics for this one
and it wasn't necessarily like a collab
collab that they did but they came out
with those element palettes the fire
palette and the rest of those I bought
the fire palette so that's what I'm
speaking of but they had different
influencers as like the face of these
palettes like eat and each influencer
you know had a different palette and she
you know did a YouTube tutorial with
this and you know their faces and stuff
were probably on the buyer generally
remember but anyways we had influencers
kind of being the driving force behind
the different palace and I don't feel
like those palettes were very well
received I returned my fire palette
because I thought it was crap and I know
a lot of other people didn't love them I
think there
like one pallet that people seemed to
say was really good and I honestly can't
remember if it was like the water pellet
I don't remember but I felt like in
general those pellets did not do well
they pretty much very quickly went on
sale as well and then nobody talked
about them even the influencers that
were working with NYX like you saw their
initial videos and then silence I didn't
see anything about those pallets so I
was like mmm okay so I thought that was
a little bit overrated in my opinion
okay so next up we have a makeup release
in general this one was kind of hard
especially for under under rated I was
like what has been an underrated release
and honestly I just saw another one
today that surprised me because I didn't
even know about this
so Sigma Beauty recently did different
collaborations with influencers and I
feel like the entire thing has been
super underrated because they did a
collab with my friend Angelica I have a
box somewhere a collab with Angelica
that's one of my friends here on YouTube
so I bought her brush set and I was so
excited I was so pumped up for her like
the minute she released her videos like
yes I can't wait I'm buying him I love
all the brushes that she chose thought
it was amazing and then it was like a
week later I noticed another influencer
Kendall Alfred who I also enjoy here on
YouTube she did a collaboration with
Sigma and I was like oh my gosh like how
come I didn't know about that I didn't
hear about that
I think I was out on like her Instagram
stories and they had already been out
I'm like what and then just the other
day I saw that Taylor Taylor from that
tail of I can never say her channel name
correctly I apologize she did a
collaboration with Sigma and I was like
I didn't hear anybody talk I had no idea
that happened and then I was scrolling
through Twitter the other day
and somebody who I don't even know here
on YouTube did a collaboration with
Sigma and they were saying thank you my
brush is sold out not so exciting and I
was like what and because Sigma had like
retweeted it or liked it or something
stuff popped up on my feed and so that I
was checking out her channel cuz I was
like I don't even know who you are but
like all of these wonderful amazing
talented youtubers have done
collaborations with Sigma and I feel
like I like AI feel like Sigma's not
really announcing it or saying it or
putting it on their Instagram er I'm
just not a song like come on
and like that's really exciting
especially if they're collaborating with
a lot of like the smaller youtubers I
think that's so freaking cool and I
think the whole thing everybody's
everybody's brushes I feel like we're
underrated cuz that's really freaking
neat so yeah it should have been more
hype about that one okay and then
overwrite it honestly I'm gonna go back
to Kylie cosmetics
ah the momager palette that just
released sorry you pulling up my
top my romper I'm like does anyone else
not do a very good job at being able to
tighten and straps I always have to have
someone else tighten straps for me and
it's super embarrassing but I'm by
myself so this is what we did but
anyways so Kylie cosmetics the momager
collection that came out she did a
collab with her mom because she's
collabed with I think all of her sisters
except for Kendall at this point so then
she did a collab with her mom it came
out on Mother's Day but it was like a
very strange collab I felt like because
she had just launched something else and
then all of a sudden this momager
collection came out and he just kind of
like came out of nowhere we're all just
kind of like hey what huh what happened
cuz usually she's really good at sharing
what's coming up sharing sneak peeks and
swatches and all of that and it just was
kind of like boom there I was and I felt
like that was weird
but then also I think what frustrated me
and what made me feel like it was over
right it was so many of the big
youtubers that did videos because they
all got the PR packages they did videos
on it and I felt like I was feeling a
little bit flustered because there was
some bigger youtubers who maybe don't
post as much don't post as often you
know just things like that that I hadn't
been seeing a lot of like regular videos
from them and I understand these people
have amazing opportunities and they're
traveling all over the world and they're
doing big things and that's wonderful
and fantastic but they haven't been
posting as much and then all of a sudden
all of them do a video on the monitor
collection and I'm like in it I get it I
get it but you don't mind me happy and
it makes me think it's overrated okay so
next up we have an eyeshadow palette
this was kind of a tough one for me but
I grabbed out a couple so for an
underrated palette I chose the bomb this
is the meat matchmaker honestly I feel
like I really don't hear people
talk about the bomb pellets a lot in
general and I've only tried a couple of
them myself but I quite like them and
especially this one I'm really freakin
enjoy I really like the layout of it how
we kind of have like the couples the
pairings of the different eyeshadows you
have a nice mirror in it I really like a
lot of these tones in here and the
eyeshadows are really nice really good
quality and I really like this eyeshadow
palette I had good things to say about
it after I got it and was trying it out
so this would be my underrated palette
choice for overrated I had a few for
over way that I could have chose but I
went with this one from busy art and I
know there's people though they're gonna
be mad at me and like was it I think it
was this palette in a video when I was
saying like I didn't love it the other
day like someone just like schooled me
in a comment it was like an 8 paragraph
comment about like how I'm such a
terrible person I don't love this
palette and I'm like I don't know I
could only tell you my true feelings
like I can't tell you how to feel about
makeup I can only tell you how I feel
about the makeup and for me this is this
is kind of overrated oh it's just
because I feel like I hear so many
people say amazing things about the
quality of these palettes and keep in
mind this is an $80 eyeshadow palette
that I'm holding up like an $80
eyeshadow palette and people say this is
the best formula and all these other
crazy amazing things and I just I think
it's okay like it's not bad it's not
terrible I'm gonna keep it and I reach
for it sometimes but it just like didn't
you know I wasn't fainting over this
palette it's just all right to me don't
be mad okay I'm just gonna set that one
down quietly and we're just gonna it's
gonna keep moving okay so I shadow
formula so this one this also kind of
like tripped me up for a little bit too
and I was like mm what can I say here
are underrated I decided to go with
Divina cosmetics so I recently was able
to try out Divina cosmetics eyeshadows
and I was so impressed by them Davina
Cosmetics is an indie brand you can buy
single shadows on their website and
I was so so impressed with them I
reviewed them in an indie brands review
video and had great things to say about
them I was so excited they recently sent
me this new collection that they have
and I just got it I just put it in my Z
palette yesterday like late last night I
think it's so beautiful I can't wait to
try these as well I'll be reviewing this
in my next indie brand tutorial but so
excited about that but yeah the first
shadows that I tried for them the first
single shadows that I've tried I was
wildly impressed with them so I think
that's pretty exciting
and then overrated I I decided to go
with the Urban Decay Naked formula so I
got the naked smoky eyes like a
Christmas gift one year and I remember
being so excited sounds like everybody
talks about these naked palettes and I'm
totally a part of the credit map this is
fantastic and I actually didn't love
them and I ended up to cluttering it out
of my collection and then Urban Decay's
that made this guy so this is the
original Naked palette and I was like oh
my gosh like this is so exciting it so
this is what the original Naked palette
looks like and I've used it a couple of
times and again I'm just like it's
alright like I read it's just not
anything that I'm like man like people
talked about the naked formula of The
Naked palette for so long and had so
many good things to say about them and
then I try and when I'm like it's good
but like not great hey you know the same
but yeah thought of that one for the
overrated and then moving on to eyeliner
so they said either liquid or like a
regular liner so for under rated I
actually picked up two so I have a
regular and then also a liquid liner for
a regular liner I have these from Pier
these are the OnPoint pencils I really
enjoyed these and I feel like I hype
them up a lot but I don't see a lot of
other people talk about them they're
really creamy they're very pigmented
easy to get into the waterline they're
also self sharpening which i think is so
awesome when you close them and you
twist you're automatically sharpening it
and I think that's fantastic I really
enjoyed those and then also for a liquid
this here is from the balm it's the
shwayne eyeliner I did not think I would
get on with this eyeliner but I actually
really really do and I think it is quite
nice I was
really intimidated by this applicator
but I I find it so easy to use which is
super exciting it's very black it dries
matte and it doesn't go anywhere so I
think this one is so good and then for
overrated I don't have it on me anymore
but it's the Kat Von D tattoo liner so
many people raved about that liner and
they said it was the best liquid liner
and it's so easy to use and I got it I
think I bought it and then I also got it
in a point perk or something like that
and I was like I just don't love this it
was fine don't get me wrong like it was
fine but there's definitely other
eyeliners and liquid liners that I love
so much more so I was like I don't
really get that one okay and then moving
on to mascara hello there you are
okay so mascara for underrated this is
from essence it's the Rockettes who are
at mascara I love this mascara I talk
about it so much I've been through
either one or two of these it makes your
lashes long and it makes them full it's
waterproof it doesn't go anywhere it
doesn't get on your face I don't feel
like I hear anybody talk with this
mascara and I think it is so good for
overrated I chose the Tarte maneater
mascara this is just a mini and I came
in a set but I was so excited because
this was from a while ago but I remember
so many people saying my favorite
mascara is the Tarte man-eater and even
like when I watched the Tarte cosmetics
snapchat so many of the girls are like
my favorite mascara is the main heater I
can't wait to try it I don't feel like
it does anything for my lashes
nothing length or volume I feel like
when I put this on it's like the
invisible mascara like what so yeah no
this one doesn't know go for me okay so
I'm actually coming back to refill my
couple parts because if you guys didn't
notice in some of the prior clips there
is lipstick all over my teeth so I'm not
sure what my next liquid toy is doing me
so dirty cuz I wear these a lot but it
started to get like really out of
control so I'm just going to uh sit down
and refill them some of these real quick
so it's not I was distracting as it
probably has been the last couple of
minutes here so alright moving o it now
I'm gonna be like super paranoid too so
moving over to a foundation for
underrated foundation I chose the number
seven is stay perfect really like this
foundation it reminds me of the Lancome
at 10 T dual foundation which is one of
my favorites and I hear a lot of people
talk about that one this one
I think it's really similar to it and I
really like it and then for overrated
I picked the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation now I'm wearing it today and
I like the foundation again overrated
doesn't mean that you don't like it or
it's super bad but I felt like so many
people talked about this foundation and
used it and loved it and when I got it I
thought it was just okay it just it
didn't necessarily blow me away it's not
my favorite foundation I still like it
but to me it was pretty overrated for
concealers for underrated I think this
one was George's as well it's the NYX HD
studio photogenic concealer I believe I
tried this out when I did a collab with
Cam and we were trying to each other's
drugstore favorites so I bought this
because it was hers and it turned into
one of my favorites but I definitely
don't feel like I hear a ton of people
talking about it but it's full coverage
it's easy to blend I think it's a really
good concealer for overrated I chose the
NARS radiant creamy concealer it's just
a concealer that I tried because so many
people hyped it up it was like so many
people's holy grails and i did not like
it at all I got a sample of it and I
would not purchase a full-size of it it
was too much it was too thick it was too
cakey that did nothing for me I did not
like that one okay so going over to
primers so one that I think is
underrated and I think this was
biohazardous beauties as well is from
Scandinavia and it's the makeup primer
spray so it's oil control it's a fine
mist this one is so nice because I feel
like with a lot of primer sprays I maybe
don't necessarily notice anything on my
skin a ton but this is one where I spray
it and my skin instantly looks better it
feels better it feels like it's prepped
for makeup I feel like something is
actually really happening with this
primer spray and I really enjoy it
and then for the overrated again another
product that I like and that I use
pretty frequently but it got a ton of
hype when it was releasing it's the milk
makeup blur stick everybody was talking
about this everybody is raving about it
and like I said I mean you can tell that
I've used quite a bit of it I do like it
because I really do think it is a good
pore filler I like it to put right here
and then here on the center of my
forehead but for me it's kind of
overrated because it's just good for
that and I want a primer for the rest of
my face as well and I only really get do
this like
I typically use this and another primer
at the same time because yes this is
good to fill in pores but then I want
something else for the rest of my face
as well so again I like it but it was a
little bit overrated you know and then
for face palettes this one was actually
a little bit difficult for me so for my
underrated face palette I chose this one
here from Pierre it's the contour
diary's palette I don't know if this one
is still available but I really enjoyed
this one it has a mirror and then you
have six different shades I use kind of
all three of these but especially this
top one to set my under eye concealer
and I think it worked so good I have a
contour I have a bronzer you have nice
big shades I take this one traveling
with me quite a bit and I really do
enjoy it
I really couldn't think of an overwrite
at one though like I really struggled
with that one and couldn't really think
of anything so sorry about that and then
same for blush I can't really think of
an underrated blush I feel like a lot of
blushes I love everybody else does too
and we all know about them so I was like
and then for overrated I thought of this
one again I like it but from hourglass
and it's their ambient lighting blushes
these are expensive blushes and people
talk about these like they are
discovering gold and they're the best
thing ever and I got this one in
ethereal glow and I like it
yes great packaging I like the mirror
you get a lot of product but I was like
it's a blush I like that it lasts a long
time that's really good I like that it
gives a natural glow but to me I was
like I feel like I'm missing something
again I like it I like it don't get me
wrong and I use it and I will continue
to use it but I feel like these are a
bit overrated okay so moving on to
highlights okay so for my underrated
highlights these are from all May and I
hear like you feel like you don't hear
about all my a ton but I really like
these these are a new release from them
they're the instant glow highlighting
duos and I really like the one in a top
pinky to me so it's so interesting that
I really like these because it's a cream
highlight on one side which I don't
gravitate towards and then it's a liquid
highlight on the other side which I
don't gravitate towards and I just
thought that was kind of funny because I
like powder highlights but these gives
such a pretty glow I want to say it's
like a natural glow but it's like more
than that I think they're really nice
and I think
make a really nice duo as well and then
for overrated again I like these I
recommend these but I do think that
they're a little bit overrated and that
would be the highlights from Oprah again
these are really really pricey
highlights a lot of people recommend
them I I do as well
I recommend it pillow talk in my summer
essentials video but pillow talk to me
is a different highlight from the other
Oprah ones that I've tried and that one
is the best one this one in blissful is
the first one that I bought and I like
it
it's very blinding it's not subtle at
all but it also has glitter in it and it
can kind of emphasize the texture on my
skin and I don't love that about it and
I've noticed that with some of the other
Oprah highlighters that I've tried I
have so many of my collection and
honestly for my next highlighter
declutter I feel like there's gonna be a
few of them that go not pillow-talk
because I love that one but they're a
little bit overrated for me to be honest
okay moving on so we have Bullitt
lipsticks so or then I put my Bullet
lipsticks oh this is so crazy refilling
I'm already it's already 5 o'clock right
now and I'm just like so flustered and I
know I looked at myself at one point in
the mirror and I just had lips like all
over my front teeth I was like are you
kidding me and I was trying to pinpoint
where exactly I should start refilling
from and I was like I got super
overwhelmed so sorry that there's a few
clips with lipstick on my teeth I know
you all think I'm perfect in every
single way but that's just real life
okay alright so for my underrated
Bullitt lipstick these would be from
Maybelline this one here in truffle
tease is one of like my all-time
favorite nudes I think it's so good
these are affordable they're drug store
they're nice and pigmented they're easy
to apply and I just love these lipsticks
I've been talking about them and wearing
them for the longest time when I first
started my channel they're basically
like all I wore because I couldn't
afford anything else so there's that and
then for overrated honestly would be
these ones from colour-pop the new luxe
lipsticks a lot of people are talking
about them that got a lot of hype when
they came out but I tried three
different colors and they were all a
different formula which i think is
really frustrating they're not supposed
to be a different formula they're
supposed to be the same across the board
some were really creamy some were more
matte somewhere in between I was like I
don't get it so it's kind of
that you don't know what it is you're
going to be getting when you purchase
something so I don't love these and I
just feel like they they were pretty
overrated especially when they first
came out liquid lipsticks for underrated
I chose a loveless Beauty because I
really enjoy the all this beauty liquid
lipsticks that's what kind of made me
fall in love with the brand this one
here in Georgia is one of like my
all-time favorite nudes I think it's
beautiful highly recommend very
long-lasting they smell good they're
expensive but I think that's their
really nice
and then after overrated I chose the
anastacio Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks
I've declared them all out of my
collection and I just don't like these
and I felt like especially when they
launched so many people were talking
about them and hyping them up and
wearing them in their tutorials and I
was buying them I was going like around
everywhere trying to find them in stores
it was craziness and I did not like them
at all they were just they just did not
look good on my lips they were too much
they were too moosie they cracked off
immediately they were just not doing it
for me so yeah my over rate it would be
Anasazi out look of lipsticks then after
that we have finally made it through
this tag video okay so that is
everything for the underrated overrated
makeup tag thank you so much - Jo Jo
Harris and biohazardous beauty for the
fun idea this was a lot of fun and also
much harder than I thought to go through
my collection and pick one for each of
the different categories that they came
up with make sure to check out their
videos and of course and make sure to go
over to everyday Heidi
