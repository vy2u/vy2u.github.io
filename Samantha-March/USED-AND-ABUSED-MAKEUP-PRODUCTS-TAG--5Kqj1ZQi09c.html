today's video is going to be the used
and abused makeup tag I had a couple of
my subscribers refer me to Nicole Renee
Cutler's video I believe she's sort of
be used and abused makeup tag so I'll
have her video linked down below but
thank you so much to everybody who sent
me this video and asked if I would do it
that is what we're going to be doing
today and I'm not going to lie I kind of
at first was like I don't think I can do
it because I watched Anna clothes video
of course I am a subscriber to her so I
had seen the video and then I watched
some other people doing the tag as well
and I just thought I don't really like
abuse my makeup you know some people say
they like go ham on their makeup or
they're like an animal with their makeup
like I of I am just not that way I'm
super light handed and I'm like very
gentle with my makeup so I was like
could I even do this like am I even
going to be able to participate in this
but I went through my collection and I
think I found a few things that
hopefully you'll be able to tell that I
have really used and abused these makeup
products so the tag is basically just
all about items that we love that we
constantly use and that you can tell
have been used and have been loved so
that is what I'm going to be showing you
today from my makeup collection so is
where we get started I want to say thank
you so much for clicking on this video I
hope you enjoy seeing it the makeup that
I absolutely love and adore and I'm
constantly using I do upload a video
every single day right now which is a
lot of fun so if you enjoy daily content
about makeup and beauty I hope that you
will consider hitting the subscribe
button which want to take you away for
both YouTube and instagrams going on
right now a ton of makeup right as
they're out for grabs so those will also
be linked in my description box if you
want to get entered but I'm go ahead and
get started with the used and abused
mega peg so I do have a couple of a
drugstore foundations here that I feel
like you can tell I have really loved on
the first one is from Maybelline it's
their superstay better skin foundation
like I read I feel like that bottle is
just not even cute I mean can you tell
that I have loved on this foundation and
then I have used it a ton this is going
to be an empties video real soon because
I use this foundation all the time and
when I first started wearing this I just
couldn't stop I really loved it I
actually went out and bought the better
skin at concealer and the better skin
powder because of how much I love this
foundation so
spencer sometimes with me there in
drugstore foundation the head has been
very well loved is the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi these poor bottles have just
been through so much I would look at
those like yeah this is another one of
my favorite like this might be my
all-time favorite drugstore foundation I
love the L'Oreal True Match Lumi again
this one will probably be in an empties
video very soon along with the
Maybelline one and I would have to rebuy
both because I love them so these
foundations have been very loved on a
powder that I absolutely adore and I
thought through many of these as well
I've talked about them a lot is from a
pure cosmetics this is therefore in one
pressed and mineral powder I mean yeah
you can tell that I go through this guy
a lot I already have a backup on hand
because it's one of my favorite powders
I've been reaching for it so much in the
summer as well and I don't want to wear
a heavy foundation I reach for my pure
powder I think I have quite a few
eyeshadows that I could show and even
some eyeshadow palettes but I have to
color pop a single shadows here these
are their super shock shadows this one
is puppy love which I know is been
discontinued I mean color pop
discontinued like crazy but this one got
discontinued pretty quickly so the
collaboration with a no-kill Animal
Shelter in LA so it was only around for
a bit but you can see that I hit pan in
it I loved this for all over lid I loved
it as a highlight like cheek bone
highlight on brow bone highlight
everything I love to puppy love so much
and the proceeds went to a good cause so
this is one of my favorite shadows and
then the other one that I used so much
from colour-pop is mixed tape and you
can tell that I hit pan pretty good on
that one too and I mean it's just yeah
it just I use this one a ton it was a
really pretty like purple iridescent
shade and I just would put it all over
my lid and call it a day really I used
this one so much too from colour-pop
mixtape and puppy love got a lot of love
for me I do have a Z palette here and it
is filled with some of my makeup geek
shadows but I feel like even from just
the palette you can see like how dirty
it is these two are new editions but the
other what seven shades have been in
there for a very long time and if I go
like this
and look at appellate I can tell that
Peach Smoothie creme brulee Coco bear
and shimma shimma have been very very
abused by moi those are some of my four
favorite favorite shades from makeup
geek I've had the Z palette for probably
three years I would say maybe even over
three years and I have used those four
shades in particular so much some of my
favorite shades and I think these might
all be in my Instagram giveaway the four
that I just named I feel like those
might be the for makeup geek eyeshadows
that are in my Instagram giveaway right
now but you know this little Z palette
has been through a lot with me those
four shades in particular from makeup
geek we've been through a lot more
eyeshadows one is from her cosmetics
names and collaboration it was styled by
her Rouge if you are not new to my
channel you like have to know how much I
love this palette because it has been
featured and mentioned in so many videos
but I love this palette and again it's
like one of those that if I go like this
I can see the shades that I have just a
Mike Reider die for smitten the top
middle one definitely
and then vamp I'm surprised I have not
hit pan on vamp yet there's a huge dent
in the middle of that shade but those
two especially I absolutely adore this
palette is so nice and trouble friendly
it has the blush it has the mirror I
take this with me so often in such a
good travel palette but yeah I was like
addicted to tell oh when I first bought
it and I still really really loved it
so another palette I wasn't sure if
you'd be able to like really tell I mean
the outfit is still pretty clean which
makes me pretty happy but of course this
is the modern renaissance from Anastasia
I wasn't sure if you'd be able to tell
from the inside like how dirty it is on
camera but there's definitely not dirty
but you know there's like the shadow
follow in a lot of different places but
there's also a lot of shades in here
that have been very loved on Primavera I
think is the most loved shade from this
palette but raw Sienna burnt orange and
run Elphaba Saban fresco that's what one
of my favorite shades I think it is so
beautiful again I just when I reach for
this palette I was reaching for that
shade so much to create was a really
pretty ma for a groom and take a look I
think I even did a tutorial like last
year with this palette on
type of look but I love those shades too
but this is another palette that I chose
to feature in the user views tag because
I take it traveling with me so much like
this was just a palette that I don't
want to be without I wanted with me
because I feel like it has such a good
selection because we have like the
neutrals in the mass and the shimmers
over here but if I would ever want to
fun pop of color or even just a you know
darker smoky eye look I can get it all
from this palette so I just love it I
mean I just had to include it because
it's just one of my favorite palettes
another palette that has been used and I
feel like this one moved up when I've
been abused by me is the Kat Von D shade
+ light eye palette I love this palette
it's up for grabs in my 20 K YouTube
giveaway but this poor palette I feel
like has been through so much and again
I don't know if you'll really be able to
tell on camera but it is super dirty a
lot of the shades have big dents in them
but also I feel like it has been abused
because I have stuck my finger oh I see
of these shades this one has my finger
mark in it this one has my finger mark
in it
this has my finger mark in it oh this
one has my finger market and unlike this
poor palette I don't know what it is
when I open it up but I just immediately
stick my finger in it but I have had
this palette for so long it's one of my
very first high-end and I just did it
again
I stuck my finger in I don't know what
it is well as palette like it wants me
to abuse it I do not understand it I'm
going to close it before any other
shades get hurt but this palette was one
of my first high-end Hollis that I
bought because everybody on YouTube was
raving about it and it was one of my
favorites I recommend this all the time
and it's definitely one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes that's two eyeshadow
palettes are both from morphe brushes
you guys know that I really love my
morphe palette so this first one is the
Surrey 500 which this one has like a
cult following on a YouTube and
Instagram again I don't know if you can
tell how much I've left on them
especially this shimmer shade right here
it has a bunch of like crazy fallout
around it this one has my fingernails in
it as always because that is what I do
this one has been fingernails with one
of my fingers given all of these
palettes but I love it it is a super
super dirty palette and it's so funny
because my mom is up here
from Alabama I live in Iowa and we were
going through my office last night and
she was looking through some makeup and
she opened this up and her little
response was oh you must use that one a
lot like yeah yep that one's definitely
sent there some love
but then she opened this when she goes
oh you use this one even more huh this
one is the 35 t from morphe this was my
first two morphe brushes palette I could
never get the three 5l because always
out of stock so I settled for the 35 t
and fell in love this palette again I
don't know if you can tell how dirty it
is but or if you can tell just how many
shades are you it's like not even that
there's like one shade primarily that I
use there is I mean there's very few
shades that you can't see brush marks in
because I have loved on this palette so
much when I first got it it was when I
was you know first getting into makeup
and it's going to have quite the
collection that I do now and this was
like this is like my jam I love this
palette so much this is from Sigma
Beauty this is their wicked gel eyeliner
I don't know if you'll be able to see it
great on camera how much is down there
there is a little speck up the bottom of
the pan and there - there's eyeliner
like all around like this thing is so
dirty I just need to get a new one and
just retire this one it has been used so
much when I first got it I was
absolutely obsessed with it I wasn't a
big a gel eyeliner fan until I tried
this one from Sigma and then I was
completely sold this eyeliner we've been
through a lot together
I didn't feel like I had a ton of love
six that looked like they've really been
used like there's a ton that I really
enjoy or I use a lot or are pretty much
empty but I was thinking for this tag I
wanted to like kind of show the ones
that you can tell and I do a ton of
lipstick videos I recently did my top
ten nude liquid lipsticks I've also
recently done a top five best and worst
lipstick video so I'll leave a link down
below but I thought about lipstick all
the time such a lipstick junkie so I was
like I'm really going to pull all my
favorite lipsticks like we're going to
be here forever so I wanted to pull the
one that I felt like you could really
tell kinds of love that one is the bear
at all from what in wild I don't know if
you can tell probably even just about me
taking the cap off like there it's like
lipstick everywhere I use this so
so much I still use it I still use it
and I have had this lipstick for a long
time
that like I should probably just throw
it away because it's not looking too
good
but here is what bear doll looks like it
is a beautiful nude and I bought this
because kathleenlights recommended it in
a dupes video once and she said I was a
dupe to Mac's velvet teddy and I
couldn't quite afford Mac yet so I
bought the dollar 99 what does this even
call like the icon lipstick or something
like that from wet and wild I'll try to
find it and leave it listed down below
but she said bear doll was a dupe and I
bought it and I felt super cool because
I did and you can tell we've been
through a lot together but it's still
honestly one of my favorite lipsticks I
reach hard all the time it's a gorgeous
nude and then to wrap up the video I
wanted to talk about lashes because a
lot of you know I love false lashes I've
been wearing lashes for years I mean
years and years and years I just I love
lashes I wear them a lot I don't have
them on today I'm actually testing out
some new drugstore makeup this should be
the video that goes up tomorrow on
Monday I believe it will be so I put all
of this makeup on in the video and now
I'm just letting it shouldnt baron 8 and
sit and see what happens so I can fill
my final thoughts on it so I thought why
not film a video be in front of my
bright lights see how everything holds
up but I don't have lashes on because
I'm testing out a new mascara so that
video although up tomorrow but normally
you guys see me in lashes a lot and I
have three pairs here that have been
used and abused and I think that you can
actually kind of tell with these so the
first pair is from Koko lashes and these
are in the style Queen B my lovely
friend Kelly sent these to me and I was
so grateful because I've been wanting to
try these for so long because the left
her looks always raised about them and I
don't know if you can tell if you'll be
able to see on camera like how dirty the
fans are like I need to get a new pair
because I basically destroyed these
clean my lashes a lot I do have a video
on Instagram showing how I clean my
lashes because I have been asked but
sometimes you just get to like the point
of no return with lashes like you just
you can't do anything more from them and
I think my queen bees are just about
there I wear them so
I wear them too like more formal events
I warm when I was a bridesmaid recently
I learned more casual events like when I
went to a baseball game the other night
I just love these lashes the bags are
kind of melt stained with like
eyeshadows and there's like a cold
bronzy eyeshadow on there I'm definitely
going to get a new pair of the cocoa
queen bees because I think they're
amazing and they're only like seven or
eight dollars or something like that so
that is awesome but yes these have
pieces been through some love another
pair is from who - beauty these are the
Samantha lashes this is not my first
pair of Samantha lashes from who WD I go
through these quite a bit - my last pair
definitely got very abused because I
actually went to put them on with a
tweezer one day and the tweezers snapped
the lash in half like that's how like
old and brittle they had gotten to be
because I wore them so so much but again
these are kind of in the same shape and
I just washed these not too long ago I
watched some usually when I wash my
lashes I watch like I said like you know
I watch like five pairs or whatever at
once it's not really worth it to just do
one so I just watched these pretty
recently and you can already tell like
the bands are just full of goop and
eyeliner it's always kind of hard to get
the actual especially if you were like
glitter eyeshadows and things like that
it's really hard to get them off the
lashes no matter how much you try to
clean them and take care of them but I
do I try to reuse my lashes at least 20
times at least 20 times I try to reuse
my lashes if not more usually more but
if I'm trying to be like super realistic
of how often I can reuse my lashes at
least 20 times and again I'll have my
video on Instagram linked down below
I just use water and coconut oil and
clean them and things like that but yeah
my food of Samantha lashes we've been to
a lot together and a lot of pairs then
my final pair I feel like if you guys
watch my channel you're like when are
you going to mention the pure lashes
because I wear pur cosmetics eyelashes
all of the time their eyelashes are new
to their line and they are mom already
replaced a pair and I just think that
they're amazing this pair that I pulled
out though is diva because diva diva is
pretty much done I think I think he was
done and I just washed these again and
not too long ago but these
been washed probably three times maybe I
think I'd say and you can't I mean you
can't just continually wash and wash and
wash lashes at some point you do have to
throw the lashes away these are going to
wash so much but look it just sticks on
my hand because it's so sticky from all
of the eyelash glue that I used the
House of lashes eyelash adhesive super
super sticky but it's also really really
long-lasting but they have to be
officially retired which I'm so sad
about but the diva lashes I need to
replace these like ASAP because they are
amazing I wear them so very often but
these four guys because I've definitely
been used and abused by me I thought
doing everything is would be used and
abused makeup tank I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video or thought
it fun or helpful or informative in some
way thank you to everyone who tagged me
and asked me to do the tag as well like
I said I will have Nicole's original tag
video listed down below also if you want
to go check out her channel and watch
her video if you haven't seen it yet but
I thought it was a really fun idea and
kind of different from a favorite Orrin
empties but to show the items that we
really like get into all the different
reasons why we use and abuse them you
know we travel with them or we just like
to stick our fingernails in them you
know things like that so I hope that you
