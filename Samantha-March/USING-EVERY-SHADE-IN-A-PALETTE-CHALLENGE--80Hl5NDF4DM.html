today's video is going to be a makeup
challenge video I'm going to be doing
the using every single eyeshadow in a
palette challenge I've seen this video
floating around and all of a sudden my
comments section was so many people were
requesting me to do this video and at
first I was like there's no way because
I'm going to fail and then I thought
yeah let's just give it a try the more
people kept asking I was like I give it
a try I can do something outside my
comfort zone
let's just go with it so I've seen
Alyssa actually J kissa and also robbed
you Chrissy doing this video so I'll
have all of them linked down below and
honestly watching Alyssa and then Jay
kissa I was like okay you guys both
completely nailed it Robbie to Cruces
was just really funny to watch so if you
haven't seen any of their videos yet
I'll have them linked in my description
box but I thought let's let's just give
it a shot so I'm going to be using at
the yes please Pellatt from colour-pop I
was just talking about this palette the
other day how I feel like nobody really
talks about it anymore and it was so
like hyped up when it first came out so
I've been wanting to reach back into it
for a while and I thought let's give it
a shot it's twelve shades which I think
Alyssa and Jay kissa did and then
Christy tried to do the 28th and she
said probably using a 12 was a better
idea so I'm gonna use these twelve
shades and I'm gonna try my hardest to
come up with an actual like a wearable
look I don't know if that's gonna happen
but we're gonna give it a shot so if
you're ready to jump into this challenge
well let's go ahead and get started
okay we are nice and zoomed in so first
up I hope I like don't forget what
shades it is that I'm using so first up
in the palette I think I'm actually
gonna grab this shade and put it all
over my lid I do have some concealer on
my eyelid as my primer but I'm just
gonna go ahead and use this one first I
have the rest of my face makeup all done
but I feel like I was really nervous to
do this challenge video because I'm not
necessarily what I would consider like
an artistically creative person so it's
it's challenging for me sometimes to
look at a palette and come up with a
look and then as
when I'm being challenged to use every
single shade I mean how often do you go
into a pallet and you use every single
shade so I'm like how do I create like
an actual look from this and especially
watching Elissa Ashley's like beautiful
creation on her eyes I was like oh my
gosh I'm gonna be nowhere near that
level but I got so many comments and
people have been so sweet writing in all
these different video ideas that I can
be doing right now and I thought why not
do a challenge why not do something
funny and then seeing that broad beauty
Kristi's do it I was like you know what
even if I don't do well you know maybe
I'm entertaining some people or honestly
if just entertaining myself as well so
that's why I decided to give it a try
okay so I think next I'm gonna go in
with this brown shade right here I'm
going to use Adele iam tools blending
brush I kind of wish I've picked a
palette that had a mirror on it but
that's okay
so I'm going to use this as like a
transition blend it into my crease hole
boy I was looking up this palette and I
chose it because like I said I was just
talking about the other day and feeling
like nobody really talks about this one
anymore and had the twelve shades but I
also I like I kind of feel like the
shades do make sense to one another like
there's neutrals in here but there's
pops of colors there's Matt's they're
shimmers but I feel like maybe I can do
something with this palette that's
cohesive because I pulled out a couple
other palettes too but I was like I
don't know there's so many different
colors in the palette that I'm like
would I really be able to create
something that's like somewhat wearable
I am planning on going out after this
but we shall see if that works out okay
I'm gonna use the same brush I'm going
to come into this shade right here and
I'm just gonna do the same thing I'm
gonna kind of blend it as I was looking
at this palette I was like okay I'm just
gonna blend a whole bunch of shades
together and throw some shimmers
everywhere like I could not plan out a
look as I was just looking at it I
couldn't really plan it out I was like I
think I just have to like jump in and
see what happens as I go along I have
had this palette for a while my friend
Candace sent it to me but I haven't used
every single shade in it yet so I'm not
a hundred percent However shade like
performs or like would look on my eyes
or things like that but I was
you just got a you just gotta do it a
try and you know just have fun one that
I feel like somebody on the makeup
challenges are just fun you know they're
just they're fun to do they're fun to
create and they're fun to watch like I
was having so much fun watching the
other videos that people are doing for
this challenge so I just thought don't
put so much pressure on yourself just
have fun
okay I think I'm gonna take the red
shape now now this is where I'm like mmm
is this gonna work out but I'm gonna
take the red shade and a little more
feet g18 it's like a pencil like a
bigger of a pencil brush I would say so
I'm gonna take that shade and I'm going
to apply to the outer part of my eye and
to blend that out I'm going to come in
with the orange and use a not very clean
at all ah Sigma e25 brush you know real
life so I'm just gonna put a little bit
of that shade on there and I'm going to
blend that one into the inner part of
the eye this is like where I'm
absolutely terrified like I I have no
idea what I'm doing
from here on ol boy actually don't hate
the way that looks right now okay okay
let's do the other eye then this is
where things are gonna get a little bit
on the weird side because I just got to
be doing something I'm gonna take this a
shimmer shade actually with the same 825
and blend that into the crease because
I'm like how many showers can I actually
put on my lid and you know what
sometimes shimmers in the crease are
pretty so I'm just going to kind of tap
it onto the outer V and then blend it
into the crease cuz we breaking the
rules today it's still not not hating
not hating how this is going okay I just
I feel like I'm like setting myself up
to just like be absolutely devastated
when it doesn't turn out wonderful but
so far so far so good
alright let's get some my shimmers on
the lid I'm first going to come in with
this one from the
top a row and I use my Sigma e 54 and I
did get it a bit damp so I'm gonna come
in with that one and kind of focus this
one on the outer to the middle part of
my lid and why don't use that one you
know that one looks pretty great and
then I'm gonna come into this orange a
shimmer on the bottom room and use the
same brush I'm just gonna kind of like
flip it so the other side I'm gonna
apply that one to like the middle inner
part of my eye I'm kind of nervous for
this color but we shall see it's really
not too intense I did respray my brush
before I came in with it and it's really
not that intense of a shade so maybe
this one won't be the one that ruins the
look a bunch of fallout on my face so
I'll just clean that up which is a
bummer since I do have my face makeup
done but that's okay but still still not
hating it's still not hitting I'm
starting to get weirded out
hey so I think I have my eyelid done I
still need to do my lower lashline and
some brow bone and inner corner
highlight and things like that but I
think I only have four shades left to go
out of this so I think I'm doing pretty
good so far but my camera is gonna
overheat so I think I'm just gonna apply
my lashes right now which I'm a little
nervous about in case I changed my mind
gonna do my lashes off-camera and the
way will come back to finish up the look
and just keep let's just keep our
fingers crossed because I think we're
actually doing it I think we're doing it
wait so I added my lashes and I did add
a brown eyeliner to my waterline and I
have to say that I'm still not hating it
but now we're gonna work on the lower
lash line and we have to use that yellow
still so things could take a turn so I
think we have four colors left I believe
it's this one this one the yellow and
the deep brown okay okay we're gonna do
this so I think I'm first gonna take I'm
going to take the deep brown over here
and this is a morpheme 506 the pencil
brush and I'm going to sweep that on the
lower lash line
okay I'm honestly struggling with where
to put the yellow
I'm gonna try it on the lower lash line
first I'm going to use more feet e43
just like a flat definer brush I just
can't decide what to do with this yellow
it's like a wild card in here but I'm
going to press that against the lower
lash line nicely like not all that
pigmented so I got to work with it a
little bit but I'm gonna work with Nick
so I still want the yellow to somehow be
in here but it I'm gonna build it up
okay I'm gonna work on the other eye
it's so hard to get this yellow to build
up but I'm doing my best okay that's the
best that I could get the yellow I've
been sitting here for so long I'm going
in to highlight the brow bone with this
first shade here and this is a more feet
ether t-6 then I think we just have one
last color to go which is this gold
shimmer right here I'm going to use the
same brush and I'm going to highlight
the inner corner the other kid smiling
all right and then after that I am a
fairly confident that I used all twelve
shades in the color pop yes please
palette I'm so paranoid that I missed
one I just keep looking back like I
think I got him all right like I think
I'm pretty sure that I got him all in
this is the look that I came up with and
overall I have to say I'm pretty
surprised I don't hate it I kind of like
the sunset vibes on the top I like the
inner corner the only thing I don't love
is the yellow on the lower lash line but
I just could not figure out where to put
that yellow but that's really the only
thing that I'm not digging like I
actually really like how the lid shades
came out it was a lot of layering and a
lot of blending but still I think just
came out pretty darn good and much
better much better than I expected it to
so I'm going to add a lip color and then
we'll finish off this video already so I
added a fin T a lipstick and then this
is going to do it afford the makeup
challenge trying all of the eye
in one pallet with the colour-pop yes
please palette I would love to get your
guys's feedback what do you think how do
you think that I did I don't hate it and
I kind of thought I was going to but I
honestly I don't hate it the only thing
that I didn't love was the yellow but
other than that I actually had a really
good time doing this and it's something
that I normally wouldn't do I would
normally do like three shades on my eyes
I was talking about the other day I do a
crease color and that outer V corner and
a shimmer and I never would have put all
of these difference mattes and shimmers
together and see what it created but I
actually really do like it so I'm really
happy that I did this challenge and
thank you guys so much for submitting so
many comments asking me to do it because
it definitely did push me out of my
comfort zone but I really did enjoy it
I'd love to get your feedback and what
you thought of this makeup challenge
video and if there's any other
challenges that you would like to see me
do but other than that I hope that you
guys did enjoy today's video and if you
