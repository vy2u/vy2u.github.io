today's video I'm really excited to do
because it's going to be a bit of a
personal makeup challenge so I've had
this idea in mind since I did the using
every shade in a palette challenge which
was a couple months back as I was taking
on that challenge and I was looking
through my eyeshadow palettes I realized
that I have a lot of eyeshadow palettes
in my collection where there is multiple
shades in that palette that I have never
used if you are newer to my channel I
have my comfort zone
definitely when it comes to makeup I
have a preferred technique when it comes
to doing my eyeshadows I have preferred
colors that I like to use and even when
I go into my palettes a lot of times I'm
creating very similar looks with very
similar shadows and a lot of times I
completely leave shadows out of palettes
I have older palettes in my collection
that there are shades that have never
been touched in there and so I said to
myself you should do some sort of
challenge where you are using shades
that you've never used in a palette and
I had it on my list for a while and I
was like I don't know if that's really
like an interesting challenge because
you know it's not like I'm going to use
every single shade that I haven't used
in the palette because the point isn't
to like make myself look crazy it's to
get out of my comfort zone I talked
about being in my comfort zone a lot and
I don't think that that's a bad thing at
all in the slightest but I also think
it's fun to do these types of challenges
and just be able to challenge yourself
to do something different to mix things
up so that's what I want to do today I
want to challenge myself to take an
eyeshadow palette in my collection and
only play with shades that I have never
used before so I was going through my
eyeshadow palettes the other night and
it was a pretty embarrassing number of
how many palettes I could have chose to
do this with because not only with
there's so many shades in palettes that
I haven't used but I felt like I could
actually make color combinations you
know there was a course a few where it
was like a really deep black in a really
deep brown but I haven't use and it's
like okay I can't really do anything
like that but the palette that I decided
to use for today is the violet boss
hashtag palette
chose us because it's a bit of a newer
palette but it's definitely the newer
palette to me and I've only used it a
handful of times as I was getting ready
to review it and I felt like I had a
good variety in here and also kind of
when I was looking at this I had an idea
in my mind for something that I wanted
to do and I thought I could achieve it
with this palette so that's what we're
gonna be doing it today I'm going to be
trying to create an eye look that is
wearable and something that I still
enjoy but using shades and the violet
vos hashtag palette that I have never
used before I've never touched I've
never put them on my eyes so I have no
idea how this challenge of video is
gonna go it's gonna work out well or if
I'm just gonna like hate it at the end
but I thought it could be fun to
challenge myself and I thought it could
be fine it to film it as well so why
don't we just go ahead and get started
already got my ears on yep zoomed in
since this is just focused on the eyes I
do have like my face makeup on my brows
everything like that um since we're just
gonna be doing the eyes I do have my ice
primed and also set so we are ready to
go so I guess I'm going to use the
violet Voss
hashtag palette and there's a lot of
shades in this palette that I haven't
used this second row I have not touched
any of those shades
not a one and for me I don't know if I'm
really weird because I know people love
to swatch especially eyeshadow palettes
but for some reason I don't so it was
actually really easy for me to look at
my palettes and see which shades I
haven't used because I don't even
typically swatch so I knew exactly how
many shades out of here I haven't used I
also haven't used goat this ily I
haven't used um FOMO low-key living
haven't used those and then life haven't
used that shade either so I wanted to
use this I felt like I had a lot of
different options and you know maybe if
one like if I'm starting to do and it
doesn't work out it's just makeup I can
wipe it off and I can try again what I
have in mind is I actually kind of want
to do like like a halo III like halo
eyes but I don't do them at times I
thought it'd be fun to do something a
little bit different and I think I want
to try to put goat on the inner and
outer part of my eye and then
lit on the inner corner but I actually
do want to swatch these just to see if I
think that they would make sense
together because I really don't know
that
okay so goat is just a really nice matte
brown I'm honestly kind of shocked that
I haven't used it out of the palette and
then this lit is a shimmer and it's like
brown but like with a little bit of
copper to it so I don't know I I have no
idea when I say I'm not artistically
creative I can't see things in my mind I
can't visualize things so even swatching
I'm still like mmm how's that gonna look
on my eyes or if we've been in the
process of finishing our basement for a
while and my husband will call me down a
lot and he'll be like so that's gonna go
there and then this is gonna go here and
then that there and he looks over at me
and I'm like okay and he's like you you
have no idea what I'm saying I don't I
can't visualize things and I don't think
I'm not putting myself down by any means
because I don't think that's I I don't
think that does a put-down it's just how
I am it's just how my mind works so I
have a tough time and I think that's why
makeup was always such a struggle for me
because you know when you're doing your
makeup you're trying to visualize how
the end effect is gonna come together
and I don't have that so that's why I
work off tutorials so much and photos
and things like that because I just
don't have that end result so anyways
let's just get some makeup on these eyes
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and pick up
go with a small brush here this is the
essential crease brush from Real
Techniques so I'm gonna go ahead when I
do my halo eyes I'll just pack the first
shadow on the outer part of the eye I
also take that same a shade and put it
on the inner part of my eye as well this
is what I like to use a small brush but
also one that has that's you know it's a
little bit fluffy but it's smaller
especially so I can get right in here on
the inner part and when I do spotlight
eyes I don't worry about making sure the
color is built up exactly where I want
it
because a lot of times because we're
gonna put that that shimmer in the
center here I go back and forth I build
up the matte I come back in with the
shimmer I blend it a little bit
come back and build it up spotlight eyes
can kind of take me a little bit of time
as I'm trying to make sure that
everything is built up to what I want it
to be but I think that they usually come
out pretty I don't know why I don't do
them more often like I said I just have
this comfort zone with my technique if
you watch my Instagram videos like
sometimes I feel like they're super
boring because I feel like I do the same
thing a lot but I try to mix up like
palettes and colors and stuff but I feel
like my technique is pretty simple but I
always get a lot of compliments on them
and I'm like okay thanks like I'll keep
doing up if you like them so because of
this video is all about you know
challenging myself another thing that I
want to do is kind of do I don't know if
I would consider this a cut crease I
don't know I'm gonna use concealer and
I'm gonna put it in the center part of
my eye I've been kind of trying to do
this a little bit lately because I feel
like it helps shimmers pop a little bit
more so I feel like when I have been
doing this as well I get lots of
compliments on my eye makeup looks I had
used concealer for my shimmer when I did
my eye look in my new palette releases
and reviews and I got so many
compliments and so many people said did
you do something different with their
eye makeup and I was like I used
concealer so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that I've been watching a lot of videos
and tutorials like trying to help me
figure out what exactly it is I'm doing
so I'm taking the color pop no filter
concealer because this is a terrible
shade match for me it's like it's it's
lighter than white on me so I really
only have been using it for this reason
and I'm taking just a flat brush this is
a more feet g20 and so I'm just gonna go
ahead and put this on the center part of
my eye and I keep seeing videos people
saying to look up and then see I feel
like that's too far though that happened
to me the other day too so then I got
kind of scared of doing this but it's
okay it's it's okay we're just gonna try
to make it work
I'm gonna switch to an even smaller
brush and just kind of look around
everything out with no additional
product I tried to make sure the
concealer looks like someone blended
into those other shades before I put the
shimmer on but you know it's not always
perfect
done this a handful of times and I've
only done something like this on camera
once so it's a little bit challenging
for me but I think that looks I think
that's good for that good for now
so then I'm going to take the lit side I
have the Sigma Z 50
it with a setting spray to make my brush
damp that's what I like to do for all of
my shimmers so I'm just gonna go ahead
and get some of this like copper shimmer
on here I'm gonna go ahead and add it oh
that's really pretty I'm gonna add it to
the center of the eye not good not good
that's okay we'll clean it up no
perfection here funny is I almost said
look when I said it was pretty the next
thought in my mind was I've never used
this shape before I was like obviously
obviously you haven't Samantha I'm
taking my time and working on building
this up and like I said so you can kind
of already see that the the matte Brown
is kind of like fading with the shimmer
so that's when I'll go in and take my
time and build that back up too while my
camera was cooling down I went ahead and
finished off this I did want to show how
I kind of finish off that this one could
I don't know maybe you can see that this
is a little bit more blended and I
brought back in the mattes so then it's
just like the halo of shimmer in between
so I want to show that even though I
mean I'm not a makeup artist I'm not
trying to like teach anybody I'm just
showing what I do so I wanted to make
sure that I came back and show that so
I'm just gonna grab a little bit more of
the dope shade and then this first brush
that we used and I just kind of lightly
run it over the outer part of my eye
here and just make sure it looks nice
and blended in the crease to the best of
my collecting abilities and then I'm
gonna do the same thing on the inner
part of the eye here I'm just gonna
bring a little bit more of that color
back and then just again make sure it
looks somewhat blended if you need to
this I don't think it's quite like the
shimmer didn't quite lose its luster but
I'm just gonna come back you know it's a
little bit more lit and put that right
in the center and then again just make
sure everything looks blended over here
okay so that's what I
oh look like I really like how that came
out I liked both of those colors I
wasn't sure I mean like I said I just I
wasn't sure how they were gonna look
together I mean this isn't anything like
color wise out of my comfort zone but
those two aren't when I go to do a halo
wide those aren't the two colors that I
gravitate for a halo I I typically do
something really like light on the
center part of the lid and not as deep
on the outer part so I was like oh
really sure all this is good to go but I
do want to I'm gonna add lashes but I'll
go ahead and undo the lower lash line
too because I want to play with some of
these other other colors that I haven't
used yet - but I'm just going to go
ahead and put some liner in my waterline
this is an Urban Decay 24/7 glide on
pencil in Roche it's kind of like a
metallic brown kinda like what we have
going on here so I'm trying to decide
for the lower lash line like I'm looking
at the colors that I haven't used and I
can't quite decide what I think would be
best
I think I'm gonna come in with throwback
on a flat definer brush and just kind of
push that close to the lower lash line
and see if I think this is a good match
because I'm really not a hundred percent
I feel like I don't hate it
but I don't love it necessarily so I
think I'm also going to take maybe let's
try the lady boss the second one here I
feel like I like that more it's not like
a huge difference but it's just a little
bit more gold maybe that I think that I
like that so for the inner corner I'm
gonna come in with this a fomo shade it
looks really cool I don't know why I
haven't used that shade but I'm just
gonna pick up that small this is the e21
from Sigma and I'm just gonna put a
little bit right onto the inner part of
the eye I feel like that goes with the I
look pretty well the lower lash line and
so I'm not 100% sure on but I'd use all
the other mats in here besides the black
and I thought black would be too much
for this so I just had to go with
shimmers and with all those Gold's that
I hadn't used I wanted to give it a try
really like this foam I'll show you cuz
it looks like it has like a little bit
of a peachy undertone to it and for some
reason I'm like
in to peach right now I've been noticing
so that might be really pretty to put
all over my lid to see and I wouldn't
even have known wouldn't even unknown so
this is going to be it before the eyelid
before I put on lashes I don't have
lashes picked out honestly probably
takes me longer to pick out the lashes
that I'm going to wear and it even does
to apply them because I just never know
I go ahead and put some lashes on
off-camera and then I'll come back to
finish up the look with some lipstick
okay I added some morphe seductress
lashes ooh and so just to finish off
this look I'm gonna do at my lip color
on camera here this is from a bite
Beauty in honeycomb I just have a little
mini guy here I wanted to do a nude and
my lips are really dry so I wanted to
stay away from a liquid lipstick and I
feel like it's been a really long time
since I pulled out any of my bite
lipsticks so I'm just gonna go ahead and
add this already so this is what
honeycomb from a bite looks like with
this look but after that that's going to
have this little personal and makeup
challenge using shades in a palette and
I have never tried before okay so that
is gonna be everything for today's video
this little personal makeup challenge
that I wanted to give myself trying out
shades from national PAL in my
collection that I have never used before
I know that the shades are still kind of
like my personal comfort so but that's
also why I wanted to add in a technique
that I'm not necessarily comfortable
with just because this was all about
like challenging myself and pushing
myself out of my comfort zone so that
wasn't the first time I tried that
technique but I think it's still only
like my fourth time maybe third or
fourth time so it was fun to challenge
myself you know maybe this will inspire
some of you guys to challenge yourself
in a certain way when it comes to makeup
you know maybe you're the complete
opposite of me if it'll challenge
yourself to do something a little bit
more you know what I'm saying but I just
thought it would be fun to take on it
like I said you know makeup is a fun and
it should be personal preference and you
should be able to feel comfortable with
the makeup that you have on but at the
same time with you know everything in
life it's nice to step outside the box
every once in a while and do something
that puts you a little bit out of your
comfort zone so that's kind of the
underlying theme of this video but I
really hope that you guys enjoyed it if
you have any other challenges you'd like
to see me do or if you have any other
video ideas or suggestions for me oh
please to leave them in the comments
down below but I'm that if you guys
enjoyed this video or you found it
entertaining in some way I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
