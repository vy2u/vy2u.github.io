have a few like all things to share with
you I have two boxes that have come from
Influenster and then i also have a PR
package that i wanted to share with you
guys so I thought of putting them all
together instead of doing separate
videos we could kind of just do them all
at once hopefully you don't mind yeah if
you'd like to see a few items that I
have received recently plan to keep
watching very little makeup on today i
feel kind of weird being on camera I
wasn't going to fill and then I was like
no I really should cuz now we're going
to be busy the next day so this is what
I came up with OPI mine first one I got
from Influenster I got there slim-fast
box I was very excited about this i
joined influenster probably in the
summer and i have been so happy with it
i've talked about it a little bit on my
channel but i will leave a link to
influenster below if you are interested
in signing up basically you sign up on
their website and you can take like
surveys answer questions and they will
send you items to review you review them
on the influence their site on your
social media on amazon that sort of
thing you can be entered to win prizes
like I've won prizes with influenster
but you could just can get some really
cool stuff to test out and review and
give your opinion on you don't need to
be a blogger or a vlogger or anything
like that you can just be a good old
regular folk that likes to review
products on Amazon and and places like
that so yeah the link will be below but
I did get the slimfast box and I ate the
bag of chips I was in here and i also
drank the protein shake and i forgot to
save that Diaz like to show you because
I'm really bad at saving my empties but
those came in there and then also it
came with these 100-calorie snacks the
drizzled crisps and then also and there
was this advanced nutrition meal
replacement bar so it came with four
items like I said I ate the bag of chips
they were like sour cream and onion type
chips and it was just a little bag like
this
I and I ate the whole bag but like
towards the end I was like I feel full
like I don't need to eat the whole bag
but then there'd only be like three
chips left and that's just rude so I
ended up eating the whole thing but I
liked him they tasted just like sour
cream and onion chips except they didn't
leave my fingers like an oily mess which
I very much appreciate it but I really
couldn't tell the difference taste-wise
in them and then the shake that I got I
was very impressed with I was also happy
that I was sent the vanilla shake which
at first when I pulled it out I was like
ooh vanilla like I don't like vanilla I
don't buy the shakes I don't even know
ice cream like I was like oh I don't
know about this i always get milk
chocolate but I drank it and I was like
okay maybe I could buy the vanilla kind
too because it's still like it tasted
absolutely fine to me I do recommend
with like any shakes like this that you
shake them very well or else you can get
kind of that chalky taste which I've
seen a little bit of feedback like
people thinking that they're chalky but
if you just shake it really well and
even like while you're drinking it put
the cap on keep shaking it I didn't have
a chalky feeling at all but I drink a
lot of shakes like this I think I drink
the slimfast shakes no special k shakes
I drink those on a regular basis so just
got shake them when I was very happy I
was like okay my was a good thing I sent
me the vanilla because I actually really
liked it and then I have these crisps
crisps and a dark chocolate sea salt bar
to try out actually I think my husband
wants to try this out so maybe i'll let
him but i will probably eat these myself
but oh these are cinnamon to do that'd
be nice like in the morning so i was
very excited for this i was very happy
with the shakes they were a decent size
to like they were a big size the special
k ones i have are pretty small but this
was a decent size and like when I got
done I I felt full and I wasn't hungry
like sometimes after I drink the special
ok shake I'm like I could have a piece
of toast or something but I felt pretty
full outfit and I think it's because it
was a really decent size so I was super
happy to get the slimfast box because
I'm always looking for new ways to like
bring healthier option on
a PR package and this was from turns it
around here this is from two minute club
if you can see this so a while back on
my channel I mentioned that I was um
sent pura d'Or she and Putin
conditioners to test out and then they
also sent me like a vitamin c oil and a
argon oil to try out and I I fell in
love with the vitamin c oil for sure I'm
almost out of it and I'm kind of really
sad about it cuz i use it almost every
day i love argan oil always putting it
in my hair and on my body but i was so
impressed with the shampoo and
conditioner i actually mentioned it in a
favorites video it just it really made a
difference with my hair and i was so
excited about it so then pureed or
contacted me and asked if i would want
to be an affiliate with them i said yes
and then they came back and said they
actually have teamed up with this
two-minute club and basically it's like
a recurring membership type thing like
you pay some sort of fee and then you
get shampoos and conditioners said to
you on whatever sort of recurring basis
that you want I believe they're always
different shampoo and conditioners when
they get sent to you and I don't know
I'm not a huge fan of those types of
memberships especially when it comes to
shampoo and conditioner because I only
wash my hair twice a week so I don't go
through shampoo conditioner very quickly
but I know that not everyone can get
away with washing their hair twice a
week everything for two minutes Levin
pura d'Or will be linked in the
description box below I believe it is if
you use that link to check out you get
money off your second order so hopefully
that will help some of you out if you
are interested in shampoo and
conditioner membership options and to
get it at a little bit of a cheaper rate
but I didn't realize when I said that I
would be in affiliate that I guess that
like automatically signed me up for the
two-minute club and they sent me a box
recently which I was very excited about
very appreciative of I just figured I'd
be helping them and helping you guys I
didn't expect to get anything for it so
that was really cool that they sent me
another shampoo and conditioner I will
say with pura d'Or it worked really well
for me when I used it
a consistent basis like when I get
something to review like when I was sent
to the original products I only used
those products for probably four weeks
straight because I wanted to give an
honest review since then I went back to
my regular shampoos and conditioners my
Kendra's my biologische and I would work
in the pier door and I don't think it
works as well I think you really do need
to use these on a consistent basis to
see the results in your hair and I've
actually been not very happy with my
hair lately so I've actually gone back
it's probably only been three shower so
far but I started to go back to only
using pure door because I want my hair
to feel like it was when I used it again
so then I was really excited because now
i'm almost out of it and then I got
these and I was like oh thank goodness
because I'm really excited so they sent
me a thickening hair loss shampoo it
says it supports healthy scalp
regenerates and revitalize follicles and
thickens hair and increases volume which
is exactly what I need I have very thin
hair very fine hair and I have hair that
falls out a lot like when i get out of
the shower it's not pretty it's like you
can make a wig about the hair in my
shower and then the conditioner is there
ultra moisturizing conditioner with
argan oil and apple extract to nourish
the scalp moisturize and detangle hair
and add shine and manageability all
things that I want so I'm so happy I'm
so thankful that they sent these to me
because I had such a good experience
with their first ones and like I said
now I'm almost out because I use them so
frequently so I'm going to be super
excited to delve into these I can let
you guys know my feedback but again if
you would be interested in trying them
out for a little bit cheaper I will
leave that link in the description box
below I think I do get some sort of
commission if you are to use that link
so just to throw that out there it is an
affiliate link but yeah very excited to
try these okay and then the last box
that I've received recently is also from
Influenster and I was real excited when
I opened up my mail box and saw this
what I was like holy crabs be Saint
Laurent is like oh man I'm so excited
and inside was one of their new
touche eclat neutralizers have no idea
if I'm saying that right I'm not going
to lie I've only seen one person
pronounce these and I'm like okay let's
let's see if I can try to pronounce
these correctly but this is what mine
looks like so basically YSL just came
out with these neutralizers they have
them in violet which I have have an
apricot one and they have a green one
and each one is supposed to do something
for like color correcting the green is
usually used for like redness and that
sort of thing the violet one is used for
like brightening and I was trying to do
my research on it to see what I could
find and these have not really hit
youtube yet I could only find makeup by
Ali just did one by him that was
literally all I could find besides
influencers video the violent one after
doing a little research it's good for
brightening and how Ali used it was
underneath her eyes she would put this
down first and what I kind of thought
with this is maybe it's similar to like
the new Becca under eye primer how it's
kind of like a sandy color and it helps
eliminate those dark circles and also
kind of illuminates light back and then
you put your concealer on top of it so
that is what I'm going to try this out
for I literally just got this the day
before in filming so I have not been
able to try it I took a photo of it and
that's all I've been able to do so far I
tried to do my research on it before I
could figure out what to do like I said
I didn't think I was gonna be filming
today so I really wasn't even bothering
with makeup and I'm like oh shoot I
should have put this on so basically i
just clicked it a couple times and can
you guys see like the product coming out
there this is it's a very light purple
it's almost like it's almost kind of
like a pinky tone can you guys see that
ok so that's what it looks like ok so
I'm pretty excited to give this a try i
think i am going to try it under my
under eyes I've seen people also use it
just anywhere if you have like kind of
more dull skin are like yellow skin if
you put this on there and buff it into
the skin it can help brighten those
areas up I'm I'm really excited that I
got the violent one I don't usually have
a lot of redness that I feel
I would need a green color corrector but
brightening the skin and just making it
look healthier is what I'm all about
right now as actually thinking about
doing a video of like how to achieve
like more luminous skin especially in
these winter months just kind of maybe
going through illuminating primers
luminous foundations I could feature
this if I think it works out well
highlighters you know that sort of thing
so if you guys might be interested in
that video let me know but that's like
my goal in life right now is like
finding how to make my skin look better
because we are full-on in winter it's
got us it's got this right now but I'm
very very excited to try this I will
definitely be giving my opinion of
course I do need to review because that
is a part of a whole whole way that
influenster works is we get sent these
products to review so i definitely will
be trying it out but i am just super
super excited and so thrilled to get
chosen for those that is some of my most
recent products that i have been sent i
am so grateful i'm so excited to be
trying out some of these products and
just very thankful to have the
opportunity to be able to review some of
these things like I don't know if I
would ever purchase a wild neutralizer
on my own without at least being able to
try it or hearing a lot about it because
I think it's thirty-eight dollars for
the product and just to be able to try
it and review it and to be able to let
you guys know that's just the most
important thing that's what I started
out doing is reviewing and be able to
give opinions because I rely so heavily
on other people's reviews that for me to
be able to do it it's just like that's
what I want to do maybe trying out some
of these hopefully you'll see him in
like future favorites videos hopefully
we won't be any mrs. in there but you
never know gotta give my honest opinion
all that I have for today I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please do give
it a thumbs up if you did make sure you
are subscribed if you guys have any
other future video recommendations that
you would like to see please do leave
those in the comments below and I will
