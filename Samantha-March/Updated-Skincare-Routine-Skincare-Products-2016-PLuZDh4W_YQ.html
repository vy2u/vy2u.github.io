so today's video is going to be my solo
routine skincare products that I use
that sort of thing so it's not going to
be a skincare routine where like I'm
actually in my bathroom at night showing
you how I take off my makeup the masks I
use and products that I use mostly
because I do have a morning skincare
routine evening skincare routine I have
products that i use for when i use like
full face of makeup that day products
that I use when I don't wear makeup that
day like it's just different every night
so if I just showed you one routine like
it just wouldn't make a lot of sense I
also have like zero lighting in my
bathroom I don't have anyone help me
film so this is going to be easier
easier way for me to do it I'm going to
kind of go through like sections like
removing makeup skin Mexican care of
masks facial masks whatever you want to
call them oils products that's kind of
how the setup is going to be for this
video I have so many products sitting in
front of me so if you would like to know
about my skin care routines and the
products that I use okay so first I want
to talk about like what I think is one
of the most important things and that is
making sure that you remove your makeup
removing your makeup is absolutely key
in having great skin I can so recall so
many times in college where I would just
like roll into bed with all of my makeup
still on and it just like grosses me out
now no matter what no matter how long of
a night I've had no matter how tired I
am at night no matter how much I don't
want to do it you know even if I'm so
tired I can't go through and do it all
all the products at once and clean
everything I will at least take a makeup
wipe and wipe off my makeup because key
you guys take your makeup off so two
products that i have that are very very
handy one that i absolutely love is that
all my eye makeup remover pads i have
been using these for years and years and
years it is almost empty these are what
the path look like I literally have two
left these are the pads look like
they're just little makeup remover wipes
for your eyes they take everything off
there's a few different kinds this is
the gentle oil-free I honestly just buy
whatever it is that
to me that day I think there's like two
or three different kinds in these I get
my net target it's all my it's drugstore
it's affordable I literally I always
always always have these in my
collection always another items that I
think is absolutely imperative to have
is just makeup remover wipes keys from
Neutrogena it's so important to have
these because you don't have to fuss
around with other products with getting
like your pads out your cotton pads you
don't have to deal with anything you can
just grab a makeup wipe out of here wipe
everything off your face third way think
about it in the morning so these are
absolutely great like I said these are
the ones from Neutrogena so again
they're very affordable you can find my
target drugstores also things like that
I have tried several different kinds of
makeup removers and I just keep coming
back to these particular ones they are
not irritating it all especially towards
my eyes so these are just these are what
I love another product that i've
recently bought that i'm absolutely
loving for removing my makeup is the
Garnier micellar cleansing water this is
also a new product just in general to
Gagne but it says it's an all-in-one
removes makeup cleanses refreshes says
no rinse no harsh rubbing for your face
lips and eyes it's for all skins little
alcohol or fragrance so I love this
because it is so great at removing
makeup and that is specifically what I
use this for I don't use us as like any
sort of cleanser or anything like that
for my face I use it as a makeup remover
and what i'll do is i will just take
like a cotton pad i will put some on
there i will use it to remove my eye
makeup i will use it to remove my face
makeup and then i can also use it to
remove lipstick even liquid lipstick i
find that it takes us off i also find
that the all my eye makeup remover pads
take off a liquid lipstick just fine so
other people are out there like buying
liquid lipstick remover I'm like these
items from the drugstore work just fine
for me they take everything off I think
it's fine if this doesn't particularly
make my face feel clean so that's why I
still go in with a cleanser or something
else on top of it but to just remove my
makeup get everything out of there and
then go in with an ax
like cleansing product that is what i do
and i love it I've only had it for a few
weeks but I use it like pretty
religiously almost every single night so
very very happy with this this is
something that I like to use at home
where is the online makeup remover pads
and the Neutrogena makeup remover pads
those are usually what goes in right
travel bag because it's just so much
easier like with this it does have like
the pop top like that so paranoid that
this will like break open in my bag and
like bring my clothes I usually don't
travel with this this stays at home with
the other two items I talked about are
really good for travel and then to talk
about my favored favoritest favorite of
all times bow down product to that I
absolutely love and have found that I
can no longer live without these are the
facial radiance pads from first aid
Beauty I feel like I have talked about
him so much here in YouTube I talk about
him all the time on Instagram I'm always
on snapchat like look what I'm using
again today this is my second time I ran
out of my first bottle and immediately
wouldn't repurchased another one I
absolutely love these I get first day
beauty from Sephora but you can also
they are new to alta now i believe and
this is what one looks like so it's just
a little pad like this very similar to
like the aimer makeup remover wipe just
a little bit bigger and it says on here
that it helps to exfoliate tone and
brighten this I think is so wonderful
especially when i have worn like a full
face of makeup even after i go in and
use something to remove my makeup
whether it be the micellar water whether
it be and whether it be a Neutrogena
wipe when i use these it is still taking
makeup off and it is showing me how I'm
not truly getting everything off
sometimes when I come in with one of
these bad boys it is taking everything
off and I absolutely love it but it also
is toning exfoliating and brightening
your skin and you can tell after you use
one of these paths I use it all over my
face and on my neck not you like I don't
know how to explain it but you can tell
by the feeling of your skin that
something is happening like it is doing
something it kind of tingles a little
bit but it's not harsh it's not
uncomfortable it doesn't hurt first day
beauty is
really good for people with sensitive
skin and I do have sensitive skin first
day beauty has become a line that i am
absolutely like obsessed with you will
see a lot of first aid beauty mentioned
in this video because i love them i keep
buying products from them but especially
the facial radiance pads if you're going
to buy a one thing from forsake your day
to try out or you're going to buy one
thing to try to like up your skin care
routine these are absolutely what i
recommend i love that for the next parts
that i want to talk about our masks
because i love masks I have tried out
several different masks the ones that I
talked about are clearly going to be
like my favorites the ones that I use on
a regular basis and it really just
depends on the weather outside right now
I'm fairly normal I am slightly
acne-prone usually just around that time
of the month and I get breakouts around
my mouth which is very normal for women
not a lot of times do I get a really bad
nasty break out luckily that's good I do
credit my skincare routine because I
have really struggled with acne in the
past actually especially when i was
around like 19 probably like 18 19 20 21
even I did have really bad acne and you
know we have that lovely time hop app
and I look back at pictures and I'm just
like girl that's not cute so thankfully
I've been able to get acne under control
I think birth control honestly really
does help with that but then also paying
attention to what I'm putting on my skin
cleaning my skin like I said I was
probably around 22 23 that I was like
girl you can't go to bed and a full face
of makeup that is not cute so I started
taking better care of my skin I'm also
trying to lead a pretty healthy
lifestyle and that includes what I eat
what I drink that what I work out that
sort of thing which I feel like I'll
makes a big difference with your skin
but like i mentioned i do have sensitive
skin a lot of times products can like
irritate me or turn my red used to get
chemical peels on a pretty regular basis
I don't do them as much anymore and I
think it's because I've really settled
into what I think is a good skin care of
tea and something that was working very
well for me so I don't feel the need to
get the peels as often I would say
probably still get them maybe like once
every two months or so i'll get a
chemical peel but not usually attention
to what i put on my skin that's my
little skin story because I should
probably tell you guys that if you do
have any questions about my skin
reactions etc please just leave them in
the comments below and of course as
always I'm happy to answer them but
moving on to masks masks are like my
favorite thing lately I love trying them
out I love finding the ones that work
for me the ones that I like can no
longer live without that so one of my
favorite favorite ones right now is from
origins it's their clear improvement
active truck'll mask to clear pores
charcoal is really good to use when you
are like having acne so whenever I get
to be around that time of the month and
I know the breakouts are coming this is
what I stick with and it really helps
keep everything at bay I actually have
realized to realize this in like the
past two months so any time that I know
if I take it there this is what I bust
out a lot of times i've just been
finding that i can get these little
sample size as like a sephora gift or
the sephora samples that they have this
is what i will always have i think this
is like these are my second or third one
i love it but if it comes a time that I
can't get a little sample like this i
will buy the full size because I love it
and I feel like I need a charcoal mask
in my life like I don't feel like you
will ever catch me without charcoal now
which sounds kind of weird but yeah this
is on from origins I just posted a
picture of the other night of me on
instagram chillin with my mask on
because that's what I do and love it
another math that I'm super obsessed
with and I especially was obsessed that
this winter is the peter thomas roth
cucumber gel mask so of course i have a
little guy because you guys know that
I'm obsessed with samples but this is
what it looks like and it says that this
is refreshing cooling moisturizing
common gel who helps soothe dry
irritated skin with extracts of cucumber
papaya pineapple and a low and it's a
mass that you put on your face for about
10 minutes and then you wash off and
it's supposed to be like just intense
hydration so during the winter about it
usually be like once or twice a week I
would take this mask you need the tiny
is a bit of this stuff the tiniest bit
and it will cover your entire face like
it is incredible i have used this so
many times i think i got it in like
november or december i have used it so
many times and I still have this much
left to the point where I'm like I don't
feel like I'm going to need a hydrating
mask much longer because the summer is
about to come and that's kind of when i
get to oily and i like to use more like
exfoliates and things like that but i
love it i'm so happy with it i know i
posted a picture once on instagram to
just talking about how it's been my
go-to and yeah definitely a favorite
mask another mask that i absolutely love
is from glam glow it's they're thirsty
mud hydrating treatment i have the
little guy of course because why would i
have a full size up like idea though
it's just so silly right but i'm
actually almost out of this I've
actually like started to hit the bottom
of it but that's what it looks like it's
it's clear when it goes on your skin um
so is the peter thomas roth mask it's
just clear your face just looks kind of
shiny or the chancla mask is obviously
dark but this is clear and it says that
you can either keep it on for like 15
minutes and wash it off or you can
actually sleep in it and it just helps
bring hydration to your skin and helps
brighten your skin up and i believe that
what I prefer to use this for is to
sleep in I love sleeping in masks now
and the next product I talked about it's
actually a sleeping cream and so what I
prefer to do it's like I love
multitasking why not be able to give
better skin while I sleep I mean perfect
so I really do like this um I actually I
liked it so much I included it in my 1k
giveaway and i hope the winner who
received it like I hope she likes it as
much as I do I haven't tried any of the
other Glanville amassed yeah but I
really want to they're just super
freaking pricey like so pricey so I
haven't tried anything else out yet but
the glam glow thirsty mud I was super
happy with it and my final favorite
product to talk about it's not really
like a mask mask it's called a sleeping
cream but guess what company it's from
that's right you guessed it first aid
Beauty love first debuted this is not
sponsored by anybody I feel like I
should point that out this is not
sponsored by anybody any products that I
have
received from companies I'll let you
guys know everything that I've mentioned
so far I've bought by myself but this is
their ultra Repair Hydra firm sleeping
cream I first on first aid beauty i just
bought like a kit Oh tips around the
holiday time akm both like the sleeping
cream the ophtho Repair Cream a vitamin
missed the cleanser and facial radiance
pads which I quickly ran out of and then
had to buy more but it came with this
little guy of their sleeping cream this
is what it looks like inside you can see
I've put a fairly large dent in it I use
this mostly every single night usually
like one to two nights a week i will use
the glam glow usually only one night a
week i'll use the glam glow mask instead
and sleep in it but otherwise i'm
sleeping in this and i love it this is
another thing that when i run out of
which I feel like I'm never going to run
out of there's so much product in here
that I will buy more of the interesting
thing about this product is when you dip
your finger in it's almost like moosie
like and it's very thick it's a very
thick cream but it feels so good and so
moisturizing on the skin I love it I'm
obsessed with it this is another thing
that like if you're just looking to find
something new in your skincare and
you're about sleeping creams this is one
that I highly highly recommend i
absolutely much that i want to talk
about our ones that I feel like are so
so important as well and it is
moisturizers I think it is absolutely
key to moisturize and any like time that
I have Kate admire and skin care whether
it's like going to a class talking to
estheticians talking to dermatologist
etc and even watching YouTube videos and
hearing people talk and they say you
know what are some of the most important
things you need to do to have good skin
care one is always making sure that
you're taking your makeup off but
another one is to moisturize I remember
going to like a Mary Kay party years and
years and years ago and they had a thing
where it was like any time you asked a
question you've got a ticket to like a
raffled when Mary Kay prizes and I was
trying to come up with questions and she
had talked about moisturizing and how
important it is to moisturize moisturize
and de moisturize up night and I raised
my hand and I was like is there such
thing as too much moisturizing for your
skin and she said no like you should
moisturize as often as you can and for
some reason that always like stuck with
me and I just to not be able to put a
moisturizer on my skin like after i
clean my face morning or night to not be
able to put moisturizer I'm like well I
just feel like my skin is going to flake
off it feels like itchy it feels tight
like moisturizer is my best friend and
when I hear people say like oh you know
I don't really use moisturizer or i
don't own moisturizer etc I'm like what
do you want me to give you a moisturizer
album que fue moisturizer like please
moisturize your skin so I have two
products that I want to talk about the
first one is from botanics that's their
hydrating day cream it says it's
eighty-one percent organic with
nourishing rosehip and this was a sample
I believe I think I got this as a sample
from Sephora now for some reason I don't
feel like that's right no no I got this
in an influencer box look like this that
does not seem right I got this in a box
from Influenster if you're not familiar
with influenster I do unboxings like all
the time on my channel because I get so
much free stuff from them but they'll be
linked in the description box below I
definitely is something then I say to
check out you just get free products and
you review bottom and you talk about him
on social media and I got this in here
and I first opened it up and I smelled
it and it's got a very strong scent if
you don't like strong sense I say be
careful sometimes things that are super
strong and sense as well also tend to
irritate my skin or break me out this
one didn't also when I dipped my finger
into it it was a super super thick and I
was like I don't think I'm gonna like
this and i ended up becoming obsessed
with it if you can see i have made like
a huge dent in there because i wear it
so often it feels so good it feels so
light on the skin which i thought was
the craziest because of how thick the
cream is when you pull it out I was like
it's gonna feel like you know it's gonna
feel like that on your skin is full
that's what its gonna feel like it
doesn't it feels like you're wearing
nothing I
so happy with this this is one that I
feel like I will repurchase whenever I
somehow use this all up super happy with
it the other one I got is a new product
which is the ultralift miracle wake up
cream for all-day hydration obviously I
love things that say hydration like just
especially in the wintertime it's like
if I see the words hydration I'd like
come to mama this is what I need so says
this is anti fatigue hydrogel
moisturizer and I was like you type
Teague like I I like anti fatigue that
sounds nice so it comes with this a
little pump so how it says hydrogel like
I feel like that's how this should be
described it's definitely like a gel but
it's so soft like even when you touch it
to put your fingers in and put on your
face like it's so soft and it's so it's
you know how you see those commercials
were like people are getting hit with
like a balloon in the face and it like
explodes with water has anyone seen that
commercial because that's what this
reminds me of it's just like I'm
splashing water on my face and it feels
so good I don't know if I can really
confirm that it makes me like not
fatigued I'm not really sure about that
I don't really know how a moisturizer
does that but this has become my new
go-to I'm switching back and forth I
used this one for probably two weeks
straight because I wanted to see how it
was doing on my skin that sort of thing
and now I'm kind of going back and forth
between this and the day cream but I'm
actually I think I'm reaching for this
more than I'm reaching for the day cream
and this is drugstore and affordable
another quick thing that I want to
mention is a vitamin C I love vitamin C
for the face I'm obsessed with it I feel
like I'm saying obsessed quite a bit but
I really am obsessed with all these
products I have to jiggy jiggy of
vitamin C right now these were both sent
to me by the company's one is pura d'Or
and one is dell organics these are both
sent to me but I have been putting
vitamin C on my skin regularly for
probably about two years now probably
about two years vitamin C is really good
for the skin
for anti-aging is good for making the
skin brighter and I just I have to have
it in my skincare routine now I feel
like it has made a huge difference it's
interesting as I'm getting older I do
feel like my skin looks better I feel
like it looks brighter it's definitely
clearer and it's interesting because I'm
about to turn 29 29th birthday is
sneaking up on me but I feel like my
skin looks better now than when I was 19
and I think it's because I'm taking the
time I'm doing my research on finding
the products that work for me and I'm
being serious about my skin care not
just lacks Addazio like I was in college
but vitamin C I started perching this on
my own about two years ago I talked
about it so much that I feel like
companies saw that somehow out on this
interwebs and social media and whatnot
and now I get sent vitamin C on a
regular basis and I am so not mad about
it because i used the crap out of them
this bottle is half gone I've had it for
not not a year I feel like I got it last
summer and the bottle is half gone and
it is so like it's kind of gross but it
just has a pump I do about three pumps
and put it all over my skin so this one
is from pura d'Or it says its
professional strengths twenty percent
vitamin C serum it's infused with
plant-based organic ingredients it's for
anti-aging to increase skin elasticity
and firmness neutralize free radicals
and reduce fine lines and wrinkles i
love this i will find all of the
products that i mentioned i will find
and leave in the description box below
of course like I do every time so that
one will be in there and then the other
one that i recently got is from dell
organics again it's the twenty percent
vitamin c the same as the pier at door
and it says it's seventy percent organic
this product is not tested on animals
that's good fun i thought was
interesting because it has a dropper so
I just put about six drops or so onto
the back of my hand and then I spread it
all over my face um I just got this one
so I don't have a whole lot of product
used yet but I really just like switch
back and forth I found when I'm
traveling I usually take this
because it's just a little bit smaller
in size and easier for me to travel with
so when we go out of town I still take
my vitamin C serum I take my vitamin C
with me I don't let my skincare lack
just because I'm going on a trip where
I'm staying at someone else's house I
bring my vitamin C with me and I usually
bring this little guy and I love it I
can't believe I almost froze till I get
so I also do have a vitamin hydrating
mist this is from first aid Beauty it
came in the kit it says it's to hydrate
revive and refresh is this because I use
vitamin C so much I find myself not
reaching for this quite as often but
it's actually a really nice spray like
if I just want to like refresh my skin
almost like how people would use maybe
like mac fix+ or some other like spray
Mario Badescu has one that I feel like
is a lot like really popular with people
if you just want to like push yourself
up a little bit you spray a little spray
that's what i use the spore so yeah I
wanted to be sure I mentioned that one
thing I think is really important is to
exfoliate but i like to exfoliate every
single time that i take a shower i
definitely recommend exfoliating in the
shower and exfoliating like what i do
when i get in the shower i get in i
shampoo my hair i wash my body i put
conditioner in my hair and while the
conditioner is setting that's when i do
things like shave my legs and exfoliate
the exfoliator i have right now my
shower is from first day beauty it's the
facial of radiance polish and it says
it's to exfoliate brighten and purify
this is a new purchase to me I probably
use this maybe like five times in my
shower because I just got it I was so
excited to get it I was excited to get
this this is what I've been eyeing for a
while but I was like no I need to run
out of my exfoliator in my first before
i buy this because i know i'm just going
to put this in my shower and i was
really happy with it because it has like
the exfoliating beads that are in most
exfoliator and sometimes those can
irritate my skin well because its first
day beauty good for sensitive skin it
honestly doesn't feel like I'm
exfoliating because it doesn't hurt at
all it doesn't make me read it doesn't
feel like scratchy on my face it just it
feels really nice so I've only used it a
handful of times but I feel like this
will be a repeat purchase okay and
and to finally get into like my
cleansers and face washes and things
like that so I think I've gone through
everything else and now to get into like
these regular old products one that I do
want to mention real quick is from
Neutrogena it's the ultralight cleansing
oil if you can tell by how much I've
used I do love this baby I bought it on
a whim one day at target I just thought
and was like I'll do that actually I
probably should have mentioned this in a
makeup remover but honestly I don't
really use this as a makeup remover a
lot like I do with other products those
are strict like makeup removing but it
says that it removes dirt oil and water
proof from makeup rinses clean without
stripping sometimes what I'll do with
this is after i use something to take
off my makeup I'll use the oil on this
I'm a big fan of oil I'm a fan of oil
for my face I'm a fan of oil for my hair
which I feel like sounds kind of weird
and if you're an oily person you're
probably like we would not get along but
i like it i use a lot of different oils
especially for my hair i use them for my
body I have the Neutrogena oil for your
body like I love it so I wanted to make
sure I mentioned this little guy because
I really enjoy it I just think it makes
my skin like so soft a new product to me
that I absolutely fell in love with is
from Pacifica it's their seafoam
complete face wash I always sent this in
a yogi surprise box I do yoga with my
best friend Holly where the cheeky
chicks on Instagram and we competed not
competed we participated in a Instagram
yoga challenge where you post pictures

different sponsors etc we actually helps

a box through the challenge I came with
a variety of different things but one of
them was this Pacifica seafoam complete
bae / i used it i was really excited to
see these because i see these at Ulta
and I've always wanted to try Pacifica
whose makeup cleanses and tones has
coconut water and CLG complex and
powerhouse antioxidants it says it's for
all skin types
all skin types when I first used it it
smelled like butterscotch to me like you
know those butterscotch candies and I
was like mmm kind of want to eat this
but but not don't don't eat your face
wash that's not good I really really
like this because it's another one of
those facial products that to me after i
use it i feel like it did something like
my face feels like squeaky clean after i
use this and i really enjoy that i will
say i do have sensitive skin and this
does leave me read which kind of
surprises me because it's not like an
exfoliant it doesn't have any of the
like gritty ingredients or anything like
that it's just a smooth face wash but
especially around like my cheek area
right here I get really red after using
these so i usually use this in the
morning this is like my morning go to
and then i typically follow up with the
day cream because i feel like it's a
little bit thicker and I feel like
that's what I need so those are the two
products that I kind of paired together
for that reason this has been one of my
favorite cleansers for a very long time
this is probably like my second or third
bottle of this it's from clean and clear
it is the morning burst facial cleanser
says its oil free with bursting beads it
wakes you up it rinses clean and so with
vitamin C and Ginn Singh and I just I
love this I've been using it since
college I always do use it in the
morning like I feel like you can use it
at night but it's you know so it's going
to wake you up and I feel like it really
does i think it smells good this is one
that I then pair with the Garnier
moisturizer because even though this is
exfoliating it has the beads it doesn't
irritate my skin at all like sometimes
the Pacific who can leave me a little
bit red and like feeling like I need
more moisture just I feel like is very
good for sensitive skin doesn't bother
me at all so that's why I apparent with
the Garnier moisturizer instead but this
is drugstore very affordable and I love
it and then the last product that I have
to talk about is from first day beauty
it is their pure skin face cleanser so
it looks like I just have a little guy
this is what came in the first kit that
i purchased and i'm almost out like you
can see like I'm squeezing pretty hard
to get the rest of it out and i will def
to be repurchasing this once it is gone
I needed the support VIP sale is coming
up yes it's going to be excellent with a
first aid Beauty into accident booster
it removes surface oils that removes
surface oils makeup dirt and grime say
for sensitive skin once again it's just
a very nice cleanser it does the job it
leaves my skin feeling clean at least my
skin feeling smooth it doesn't hurt me
at all it doesn't make me read it
doesn't break me out it doesn't irritate
me this is really good for a daily basis
this is usually what I bring when I'm
traveling there's a product that I
prefer to use at night because I feel
like it's just maybe a little bit more
like heavy duty than some of the other
ones that I mentioned so I usually will
use this at night and typically I follow
up with the first APD sleeping cream I
think it works really well so I mean I'm
a huge fan of first day beauty i know
that i will keep buying so many more of
their products they can be a little bit
more on the expensive side but i have
found that they work they work well for
my skin and I'm just very happy with
them but so that's my last product to
talk about but those are all the
products that I had to touch on that's a
little bit about my skincare routine how
I use them what I do in the morning and
at night not that good stuff so yeah
alright guys I'll turn out to make this
outro too long because I feel like that
is going to be a very long video but the
skin care routine has been something
that has been requested for so many
months so I just wanted to make sure
that I was able to film it at some point
and maybe sometime in the near future or
faraway future I can film one like in a
bathroom I truly have no idea how I
would accomplish that maybe someday I
can but I wanted to give you guys the
breakdown of all the different products
i use why i love them what i use them

masks that I use any of my like little
tips and tricks that I can give you
