today's video is going to be a new fall
makeup tutorial I was inspired to do
this video because I went to my CVS the
other day and they had some pieces in
there from the new wet'n'wild Fall
collection well it's not like super new
anymore but it's there a fall collection
and I decided to pick up a few items and
I asked my snapchat if you'd want to see
him a makeup tutorial on it and they
said yes so the wet and wild fall
collection I know they had like some
mascaras out there to there were like
colored mascaras but what I picked up
was both of the eyeshadow palettes so
they are trios I really love the wet and
wild trios and I know a lot of people do
as well so I decided to pick them up
this one is plaid to the bone and this
one is the lure of vixen and then they
also had I think like five different
liquid lipstick shades and I picked up
this one in don't be a plum plum so
obviously just a very dark plum color
perfect for fall they were to 99 and 399
I think maybe these were 399 and the
liquid lipsticks were to 99 but I think
this is also the first time what and
wild is coming out with liquid lipsticks
so people are pretty excited over this
I'm excited to try the formula I haven't
seen a ton of tutorials or even reviews
yet on this fall collection so I was
excited to pick it up for myself let you
guys know what I think and I figured
what better way than to share a tutorial
so my last fall makeup tutorial I used a
lot of the burgundy colors so i think
i'm going to keep velu or vixen for
another time and i'm going to work with
plaid to the bone so it has like a
shimmery kind of bronzy color appear
blue and then green so we will see what
kind of look we can create with this but
why don't we go ahead and jump into the
tutorial I already have my eyelids
primed and ready to go so let's just
jump in so I am first going to pick up
the green shade at the bottom here it
says crease or it says eyelid shade but
you know I kind of just make our own
thing I'm going to grab a flat shader
brush this is the medium sweeper you 54
from Sigma so I'm going to take that and
I'm going to place this on the outer be
of
my lid so this shade as I'm actually
placing it down like I haven't swatched
or done anything with these this is
actually a dual chrome I was not I was
not ready for that it's like an emerald
green type of shade but it has almost
like a purple shift to it oh that's
pretty cool so far with this shades
there's really no fallout and it's
coming across pretty pigmented I'm not
using any sort of fixed plus or any sort
of spray with it so this shade is
looking very promising okay then I'm
going to pick up the first shade that
says brow bone I'm gonna grab my morphe
g13 and I'm going to paste this on the
inner part of my eye so again i'm not
using any sort of fix plus or anything
the pigment looks really nice and again
like no fallout I'm not seeing any sort
of Fallout and I wasn't sure what these
shades would be like and because i'm
working with darker colors that's why i
decided to do my eyes first but really
like there's like no fallout I'm way
impressed right now guys the g13 i'm
just going to blend everything together
so there are no harsh lines and then I'm
going to come back in with my sigma
brush and put some of the grain back in
because it kind of got lost in the
shuffle here so I'm just going to add
some more to that so we have the green
on the outer part of our eyes fact that
this is more on the duochrome side is
like taking this look to a level that I
did not expect it to and I am not mad in
the slightest I'm going to blend again
with the g13 so honestly when I was kind
of thinking about what to do for this
look I thought about putting the blue in
here as well I was going to put a little
bit of blue in the crease I did not
expect these shades to be as pigmented
as they were like the shade that I have
on the
our corner is very like actually very
overpowering that the blue would just
get lost like the green is almost kind
of getting lost as well because that
shade is so darn pigmented so that's
awesome so i think i'm just going to use
these two colors and call it a day man
surprised but in a very good way that's
for sure I thought that one appears to
be more duochrome like it's just giving
another dimension to the I look as well
so I'm pretty impressed this is going to
be a very easy i look I thought maybe I
would do something a little bit more
complicated but really with these shades
I mean I just I don't think you need it
it's been kind of hard to get the green
to come back as bright as it was because
of that first shades like I like that
you can see it a bit especially when you
move your head you can see it a little
bit more so I'm going to leave it as it
is right now I might go in and add more
but I kind of liked the effect that it
has right now I'm very very impressed by
this guy's and I like i said i think it
was only 399 so that's a pretty good
steel maybelline graphic liner i'm just
gonna make a pretty small wing I didn't
think to do like a large wing with this
look which is why I grabbed out this
eyeliner because this is what i like to
use when I want just like a very small
basic type of wing so it will go ahead
and see cuz i figured i thought i would
have liked green and blue and sparkle
going on and really we went in another
direction but i'm still going to do the
smaller wing
okay that's a bit bigger than the small
when I planned but you know what
sometimes you just gotta roll with it
switch over to my face work quick so to
prime I'm going to use the two-faced
hangover RX primer I got a little deluxe
size of this as a point perk at sephora
and i've been enjoying trying it out
it's very hydrating I am I've only used
it like two other times and I don't know
if I feel like it's like priming the
best but it feels really nice on the
skin and just like it almost feels like
you're putting another moisturizer on
and I think it smells really good so so
I'm going to use to Prime today I wanted
to use the anastacio Beverly Hills stick
foundation mostly so I can chat with you
guys about what I thought about this
foundation i did a first impression with
it a few weeks ago and so I wanted to
give a follow-up because i've been using
it more and you know I'll applying at
different ways and testing it out and
seeing how long it lasts so I wanted to
give you guys my feedback so i am in the
shade natural till the first thing that
I realized with this foundation is that
I feel like you kind of have to use a
lot of it I put quite a few stripes all
over my face like you'll see but i feel
like when i started to blend it out like
the coverage isn't it's not full
coverage by any means but to me it was
almost like a light medium coverage and
especially if i use a damp Beauty
Blender i feel like i have to go back
into an even three times to put more
foundation on otherwise I feel like it
doesn't look like I'm wearing foundation
so I definitely suggest using a brush
with it but that was kind of the first
thing that I noticed with this
foundation I actually was pretty happy
with my shade selection so I'm going to
use my f80 from sigma and what I do for
this foundation is that I will actually
spray a little bit of fix+ on my brush
otherwise I find it kind of hard to move
the foundation around and blend it in
that was why I decided to try the beauty
blender but with the Beauty Blender it
just was like making the foundation
almost like disappear I have found with
the mac fix+ it does not do that and it
does kind of help you know set the
foundation a little bit more as well so
I have a pretty normal skin
don't have super dry skin I do not have
super oily skin I don't have super acne
prone skin and this salvation to me is
nice is how I would describe it it
didn't like immediately turn into my
Holy Grail foundation it wasn't
something that like I'm shouting from
the rooftops that I think you need I
just think it's a nice foundation it is
supposed to be good for people with oily
skin so a lot of people have asked me
like does it make you super super dry it
doesn't it doesn't make me dry it
doesn't make my oily like it really
doesn't change anything with my skin
that way like I said it didn't like turn
into a favorite foundation or anything
like that but I think it's nice and once
I figured out the best way to apply it
which for me is using a brush with some
mac fix+ I ended up liking it even more
again still not enough that I feel like
I would put it in a favorites category
our twenty-five dollars for each stick
foundation there is a huge huge range of
colors if you're unsure what shade you
are I would suggest going into sephora
and swatching them because there are so
many shades I have no idea how I got
lucky and seemed to pick my correct
shade I did not expect that to happen
but it did it lasts a long time I
wouldn't say it's my longest lasting
foundation out there but it's not like I
feel like I need to touch up in two
hours or even like for our sort of thing
location at once i started using the
brush with the fixed plus i found the
application to be really nice with the
Beauty Blender I just felt like it was
too light but I haven't found any sort
of like patchiness um it did make me
break out anything like that so I
recommend this foundation sure maybe if
you do have really oily skin these are
supposed to be really helpful for you
guys so maybe check that out like I said
I'm pretty normal skin and it just
simply looks nice on my face it's a
lovely foundation it's not my favorite
but for twenty-five dollars I don't
think that's a bad price at all other
than you do kind of have to use a lot of
it at least I do but I didn't think $25
was a bad price for what you're getting
and I just think it's a nice foundation
the maybelline fit me concealer one of
my favorites i'm in the shade light 10
i'm just going to apply some underneath
my under eyes and i'm going to use my
concealer to clean up the shadows
and my wing as well because my shadows
typically tend to get away from me I
don't have like a lot of lit space to
work with so a lot of times when i'm
using eyeshadows they can tend to go in
all different areas because i don't have
a ton of space and then i'm also going
to use the concealer to highlight the
center of my face as well and i'm going
to blend that all in together with my
sigma f 79 is the concealer blend kabuki
this is a new brush from sigma and i
think it is amazing i received a new set
of brushes from sigma not too long ago
smelt without baking and strobing sets i
used this in my instagram body makeup
tutorial and this has become my favorite
brush out of the collection but then
also just my favorite brush for
concealer in general I've even used it
to like buffin contour and I just think
this brush rocks I'm going to go into my
wet and wild mega globe contouring
palette mine is in Dolce de leche I'm
going to grab out the setting powder
here and use my Real Techniques deluxe
concealer brush for this and I'm going
to place this powder everywhere that I
placed the concealer gonna do a light
contour using the same Dolce de leche
palette I'm just going to grab the
contour shade and my Sigma powder
sweeper it's the fo sixth it also came
into baking and strobing set and I know
it's supposed to be to like sweep away
powder or if you do like baking but
honestly it's so like small and precise
I really like it for contour I saw that
Nikki tutorials is using a lot for
contour as well and at first I was kind
of nervous because you know I'm gonna
like me go pro like I just recently
started understanding makeup and how to
apply it and so when I first got this
brush and I think I even set it in the
video like you could use this for
contour and I'm like oh my gosh what if
you can't and what if I just sound
really stupid and people are like that
is not at all what you would use that
brush for so when I saw that Nikki
tutorials was like I love this as the
contour brush I was like yes yes I did
something right I got I got weirdly
excited about it guys
that's something really soft and pretty
since I figured we were going to do a
little bit heavier on the eyes so I
grabbed out my benefit dandelion brush
it's just a really pretty like very
light pink blush and then I'm going to
pick up my morphe for to apply that it's
just such a light color just gives a
little bit of flush to the cheeks
without being like really overpowering
and we're for a minute I'm going to do
my brows I'm going to use the soft and
natural brow kit from Benefit Cosmetics
I'm especially going to focus on the
high brow and bring the highbrow down so
it kind of cleans up the shadows as well
because again since i don't have a lot
of the lid space my shadows can tend to
go up and the highbrow from benefit is
the perfect way to make sure they stay
where they are but I'm used the goof
proof pencil the high brow and then the
Ready Set route is set everything and
I'm also going to put my lashes on these
came in my fall beauty combox these are
the I slay lashes they were in
collaboration with makeup Shayla and
flutter lashes and then also in the
beautycon box came the duo it says it's
a clear white adhesive I'm going to put
it to the test right now and see if it
really is clear because I don't like
white adhesive but we will see so I'm
going to pop these off off camera in the
interest of saving time and I'll be
right back my eyes but I wanted to show
you the lashes so again these are the I
slay lashes from makeup toilet and
flutter and they're nice like on first
impression they're not like my favorite
lashes in the whole world I like mine a
little bit too like wispier and maybe
like thicker and fluffier but I mean
they're nice but here are the I slay
lashes so to move on I'm going to line
my waterline with the it cosmetics gel
waterproof liner my morphe 36 brush and
I'm going to grab a little bit of the
green shade place that on my lower lash
line and see what I think of that I just
really want to bring that green back in
because I feel like it kind of got lost
in the shuffle what's not being quite as
green
I thought it was going to be like with
having the more dual chrome effect to it
and then because the top shade in this
palette is still pigmented like I felt
the green kind of got lost i'm going to
try to bring it back by smudging it on
the lower lash line some of the Max
Factor precise mascara for at my bottom
lashes some highlight i'm going to use
opal from becca cosmetics and my morphe
m5a1 brush and highlight the cheekbones
i'm going to apply some on the bridge of
my nose and then also the very tip of my
nose and the Cupid's bow as well be
excited for I'm going to try them matte
liquid lipstick in don't be a plum plum
we shall see so here is what the
applicator looks like and i'll go ahead
and zoom you in who that is dork
ok guys so here is don't be a plum plum
on my lips very dark very bold very fall
ok so you can see don't be a plum plum
on my lips it applied very easily there
was a few spots that I was like oh I
think this is going to be a little
patchy but I just went over it again and
it seemed to work just fine honestly I
mean right now it's still drying down so
I do have to give it a little bit but it
seems to go on pretty nice i'm impressed
with the application I'm impressed with
the way it looks it's this don't be a
plum plum it's definitely very like bold
vamp you fall color it's not something
that I would normally gravitate towards
i would suggest using a lip liner with a
darker color typically will suggest that
anyways i just don't use lip liners a
whole lot myself so i wanted to try this
one out like I normally would which is
without using a lip liner but i think if
i did another time i would try to use a
liner i'm usually with darker colors
you'll get it kind of like the butthole
lips which is already happening which
happens but i'm planning to wear this
lipstick throughout the day and see what
I feel about it if you don't follow me
on snapchat yet I say do it because
they'll probably give an update over
there but it will try to feature this in
a future video as well to give you guys
an update on what I thought but after
the lifts are complete I'm just going to
spray my face with mac fix+ to set
everything and then our look is complete
ok so this is going to be my final look
I hope that you guys really enjoyed this
tutorial this kind of turned into like
my vampy fall makeup looks I hope that
you liked it it definitely was different
from what I was originally intending to
do with the wet and wild trio but hey
that's okay that's what happens when you
don't practice your looks at a time when
you just show up on camera and start
working with them this is what we ended
up with overall I was very impressed
with the wet and wild trio like I just
really did not expect it to be that
pigmented especially not using any sort
of fixed plus for the shadows I was
surprised and that's kind of what took
this look in a different direction the
green definitely surprised me I wasn't
expecting a duochrome with it so that's
what kind of made this look a lot
different as well because I just thought
it would be like straight green but it
really brought something else to the
love
I'm excited to keep playing with that
trio and the value or vixen trio as well
like I said I think there were only 3 99
so definitely super affordable if you
can pick them up I would suggest it the
lip I'm actually really liking it I just
like watch by myself the mayor and I
kind of do a double take because I never
really gravitate towards this kind of
vampy lips but you know every once in a
while it's fun to step outside of your
comfort zone it has dried down
completely matte so far I don't see any
sort of like cracking or peeling with it
yet so I think this look what lipstick
was 299 like I said I'll keep wearing it
throughout the day so I can provide
updates and a full review down the road
but first impressions like I'm pretty
impressed with it this color is don't be
a plum plum and if you're going for that
vampy fault look this is the lips that
will help kind of bring it all together
and give you that vampy sort of vibe so
definitely impress with the lipstick but
I really hope that you guys enjoyed this
tutorial I've been having a lot of fun
