back with another vlog thank you guys so
much for all the support and kind words
on my first vlog if you haven't seen it
I'll have it linked down below and it's
I don't know was it last week that I
posted that or maybe two weeks ago and
I've been getting so many comments up
like when's your next blog coming so
here it is what we're doing today
currently this is my situation just
sharing my office chair with my 60-pound
visually because she thinks that she's
very tiny and we somehow sit on this
chair together but today's video is
going to be the organization of laws so
in the first video I did some subscriber
mail unboxing and my friend Mickey had
sent me a really big box full of stuff
to organize my office and I'm really
excited about it and then I got a few
more things from a store that sells
their products on Amazon they sent me
some more organization stuff as well so
we're going to start to organize really
have no idea how it's going to go I
haven't planned anything out or started
or anything so I thought it would be fun
to do it all on camera which might be
crazy so I don't know how much we'll be
able to get done today but we're at
least going to start and start working
on it I'm also going live today on
YouTube for the first time at 4 o'clock
which is in like 4 hours so and I have
to fill makeup on at some point before I
do that so we have a busy day then I
have to go to my sand volleyball league
tonight but I thought I just need to get
it started my office is just so crazy so
overwhelming my makeup collection grew
so fast so quickly after starting a
YouTube channel and I just definitely
need some help so I'm going to show you
guys what I got sent from the other
Amazon store as well and then we're
going to get started okay so just real
quick hopefully Aries will stay in that
chair this is from I think the brands
name is song on minks songs mic I'm not
sure how to pronounce it 100% but I'll
have it listed down below and then all
of the links down there as well
they did send me this which was really
nice they're not like sponsoring a blog
or anything but I say must have saw on
social media that I was trying to
organize and they send me all these
wonderful makeup organizers are so
overwhelmed and thankful but we have
a little two-drawer guy here that pulls
out they're all like acrylic containers
as well here we have this little shelf
here and this top part comes out and
then this part comes out as well so you
can have it's stacked if you want to a
lot of these items are also like can be
stacked like they comment is that but
you can take them off but you can take
them apart and you can stack them if you
want and then this is their really cool
lipstick acrylic organizer that I'm
excited about and then we have like this
set right here which I'm super stoked
about it has the pullout drawers here we
have with more lipsticks or maybe even
like my stick foundations and another
little collector over here so again you
can take them off I can stack them
however you would like so I'm excited
about that one one is like a really big
Big Daddy and has a ton of different
drawers I don't know if I will leave it
all stacked up like this or if I'll kind
of take it apart I'm not 100% sure but
yeah just a ton of different drawers
here which I'm super excited about and
then they sent one last thing which is
this guy so more drawers on here as well
so between that and then that big old
box is what Mickey sent me that I
unboxed in the last vlog I'm just going
to go through everything and see where I
can put it I know between all of this I
mean like right now I think I have too
much stuff probably like maybe I don't
need to utilize everything but I'm not
sure until I actually like get started
but I know some of the items I think
would work well for like our bedroom and
even our bathroom so not everything
might be in my office but the majority
of it will be in here so let's just go
ahead and get started I don't know where
to begin I'm not very good at organizing
decor interior design it's just like not
my strong suit I have a really hard time
like visualizing that kind of stuff in
my head but I'm just going to go ahead
and give it a try because my office is
just like in a constant state of
disarray and it's really been really
bothering me lately stuff looks good
they're good but I want to work on first
so this is my desk and this little like
cubby up here
has almost all of my eyeshadow palettes
I don't know how well you'll be able to
see it in the light but
want to do is take all these out grab a
holder that Mickey sent you last week
and then just try to organize it I think
I want to keep my pals up here I think
but in like an actual you know organized
type of way Mickey sent this and this is
what I really want to do to like stack
the pallet I gotta figure out how to do
it in a way where I can actually make
sure I can see them because like how I
have them stacked how I did I just
couldn't even like see all the fellas I
like didn't know which month I had in
there and like I would always want the
one at the very bottom and I was very
stressful so let's see what we can do
okay so I got all of my pallets laid out
here is what we are working with I'm
going to see how many I can fit in to
this guy hopefully this fits in that
section of my desk I haven't tried it
yet but uh that's okay so one thing that
I noticed is that these are pretty deep
like that's a Too Faced chocolate bar
palette Mike look how far it goes so I'm
thinking maybe for the back row to do
like taller pallets so like my chocolate
bonbon palette the clay play palette the
new one from Tarte that one's pretty
tall what else is a tall palette that I
could use I don't know if my Carly one
would fit oh yeah that kind of fits okay
so that's the original Crowley Bible and
BH palette so that one fits there and
then on to the second row let's see do I
still want to do tall again like my
style by Haru Shin Tarte palette that's
kind of taller these color pop single
shades in a palette okay um what else
what else
the unsiyyah and
master by mario palette that's going to
be it for this row there's a few pellets
in here that I don't want to go in there
because I want to separate out palettes
that are newer to me that I haven't used
yet
so the kathleenlights and morphe palette
haven't used yet the tart reinforce or
the C eyeshadow pellet graveyard girl
and swamp Queen I've only tried this
once
christiana and cosmetics in the olympus
palette I just got that is there
anything else that I just got okay so I
think that's all like my newer ones that
I still want to try so I couldn't want
to leave that in their own little
separate pile so let's move on to this
little row here um let's take and cure
some of these I really really actually
enjoyed these morphe palette say 25 a B
so maybe I to put these in there okay
and then I think that's well I could
stack them and then maybe do something
here like oh I don't know what I could
second there maybe the tartlet okay so
this is the tartlet and bloom palette
from Tarte so we can stack that there
and then for the final row I have these
pure vanity palettes which I absolutely
freaking adore I'm thinking maybe I
could do or I could do yeah
so let's stack them okay but then from
Tarte like these ones are circles too so
this one is a TARDIS contour palette so
it has like contour bronzers blush and
highlights and then this is the make
believe in yourself so maybe if I did
like that okay what do you guys think of
that that looks okay
I'm just I don't want it to be like too
crunched and like too overwhelming
because I want to be able to readily see
what's in here and be able to grab it
easily you know I don't want to be like
fumbling around trying to grab stuff so
I think that would be okay see if it
fits in the
spot on my desk
okay so that does fit in there pretty
well I'm thinking we have some room on
the side here like maybe I could do I
don't know something there but this fits
in really well here and I think that
looks really pretty oh there's like
better light so you see it better but I
like how that looks it's way more
organized and having everything on top
of each other so okay step one so fun
fact I completely forgot about it a
whole lot of other eyeshadow palettes
that were in my spinners on my desk
behind me because I'm awesome this is
why I don't organize best here I have
these spinners and I had I shadow
palettes in each of these so that's cool
that I forgot that so what I decided to
do was like put some of my favorite
palettes in here so they're like really
easily accessible so I put the Tarte
clay plate in there because I've been
having such a good time with it this is
the Smashbox photo my eyes palette I
talk about it all the time
the modern Renaissance from anastasiya
the shade and light palette from Kat Von
D and then in the other one I put the
Tarte and her rush palette which I
absolutely love off of the toilet in
bloom and then my color pop single
shadows which I really love
so that's currently what is in the
spinners so in here now from Too Faced I
have the sweet peach palette and then
the chocolate bonbon palette and then I
put in the naked smoky from urban decay
and also the original Carli bybel and BH
palette then we have this is the light
and shade what is that what it is like
whatever shade the NACA for makeup
revolution of the Kat Von D shade and
light palette the Anastasia master
romário palette we have one of my deco
Scarlett palettes and then the lorac Pro
brunch palette my - morphe 25 a and B
palettes and I have these little D
palettes that I stuck in here at this
has my makeup geek of single shadows and
then also my a massage via Beverly Hills
single shadow so those are going to go
and that slot and then I kept the front
the same my cue pier palette and my two
circle tart palettes so huh how did I
forget about those like this this is why
I don't do this so what I have left
palette wise looks a little something
like this
I grabbed this out because I was
thinking of putting palettes in there
too but I'm not sure where I'm actually
going to put it so this is what we have
left of the palace I'm going to go ahead
and put this back on my desk and then
move on to the next step I am a hot mess
already so this is going just as I
expected
what do you think father dearies ah
thank you so much for your help
I got this back in place and then I
decided to put my three more few pellets
just over here to the side if you can
see it I just feel like they fit really
well and I have no idea where else to
put you know these big stonking huge
pallets I have the 35 t of the three 500
in the 35 R so I'm just going to stock
them there to the side and then the
spinners have me pretty happy I'll try
to leave everything listed down below as
well and clean the spinner so you can
get them on Amazon so some of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes are in here
for easy access so that makes me very
happy so one of the things like I was
really unsure about is like hey I want
to get everything in like their own
place like their own organization their
own drawer you know that sort of thing
but I'm not exactly sure where I'm going
to actually be putting everything like I
had the idea to put that eyeshadow
palette in that like little cubby hole
on my desk because that's resting my
eyeshadow palettes but like with
everything else I'm not exactly sure
where I wanted to go in the end so this
is a big project I mean like I said the
stuff on isn't going to be like a one
vlog thing because I just took that log
for me to do like half of my eyeshadow
palette collection like this is
definitely going to be a long like
organize my office series with me but
I'm just not sure where I want
everything to go yet like where its
final place will be so I'm trying not to
stress too much about like the end
result the end factor like I just want
to start filling up all of these amazing
organizers and then starting to figure
out and you know like move things around
and decide where I want them so so
there's that I'm trying to remind myself
of that because I'm feeling very
stressed right now this this isn't this
isn't my thing this isn't my strong suit
I just know that it needs to be done and
I'll be happier in the end when it is
done so just going over that so palette
wise what I have left I mean really it's
these so this is an empty Z palette so
that was really doesn't count this
moment this is highlights these are all
highlights so we have this one and this
one and then these are newer things that
I still need to use I want them to be in
their own separate section so really I
only have these four pallets like actual
eyeshadow palettes left to figure out a
home for
so that's really not that bad so I had
pulled this guy out and I thought maybe
it said in her note like this could hold
pallets as well so because I just have
the four here I'm just going to see if I
okay okay okay okay okay and then hey
that works okay so you know this might
not be like the final thing but for now
I can store the extra pallets in here
which is good I don't know what I can
put in here maybe I can find something
but that it's good so they have a home
so they're nice and tidy so now where
should I put this guy that is the
question we're here is my printer again
there's like no light over here so this
is just where I have my printer it's
stacked on top of some like acrylic
drawers I just have a little pink
tweezerman bag in the back and then this
is my Kim kardashian-west lip set like
usually you can just like very faintly
see this in a video but what if I just
go ahead for the time being and just set
that right there okay so for right now
that's where that's going to go at my
not be its final resting place but we'll
just put those excess pallets right
there
and we'll just call it day on the
eyeshadow palettes because that was
tough work okay so my eyeshadow pellets
seem to have a home right now again I'm
not sure if that's where they'll be in
the end and if you guys are watching
this and if you see anything like you
see where something could go or you have
an idea for something please leave it in
the comments because like I keep saying
like this isn't my strong suit this
isn't what I'm good at and I'd
appreciate your comments and feedback so
much that I have that cleaned up because
my I showed up house was definitely
stressing me out and I don't like where
they are now I'm just a living for this
big old pallet and I love how I have so
many eyeshadow palettes in here but I
don't feel overwhelmed and I feel like I
can see all of them and you know I can
just look at this and think okay is
there anything that I want to use in
here and I can just easily grab for it
more few pellets right here and then
this little guy right here and honestly
like in here is some of my favorite
palettes really so I didn't even mean to
do that it's just like these are kind of
more of an awkward shape but like the
lorac Pirates of the Caribbean I love
that palette the Karly the new palette
from BH oh my gosh I'm obsessed with
I've always talked about like since I
got the violet boss Holy Grail I've been
completely obsessed with it and again
the purest rolls palette like absolute
one of my favorites so that's kind of
fun that those four ended up together
and then in the spinners as well with
the haru's palette the tartlet in bloom
the color pop single shadows have to
love them they'll be really easily
accessible as well and then some of my
other favorites bigger palettes here two
of the clay play the Smashbox photo my
eyes modern Renaissance and shade and
light so those are in the spinner as
well so again easily accessible so hey
that's pretty good so I pulled out this
little guide that make you sent me I
have another one and I have sheet masks
in it so I thought that's maybe what
I've used this for but I'm thinking that
I could put my palettes like my new
palettes that I want to remember to try
out I could put in here I also found
this one on my desk this is from soap &amp;amp;
Glory it's my first soap &amp;amp; Glory ishow
palette my friend Kristina sent that to
me so I'm going to stack these maybe so
close though okay let's try again
let's try again let's see will these fit
I don't know why I thought that would be
different but I really did okay let's
try this again
mmm I cannot fit this guy anywhere if I
do it like that they spit and then this
is like my newest newest one so maybe I
could oh there it fits like that never
mind I got I figured it out okay so
these are all my new eyeshadow palettes
that I need to remember to try out so
I'm going to put them over here I
cleared out this little area on the
second cubbyhole all but will at six
it won't even fit oh you guys this is
not fun for me okay so take off the blue
eye palette I just try to put them okay
so that works I'll just like put the
Sylvan glory palette next to it it's
probably not like the cleanest look ever
and I clearly need to dust but I'm not
going to have you watch me dust on
camera cuz I'm sure that'd be really
boring and then maybe I could put my
highlight pellets in here and I think
I'm just going to like Jack these
highlight glow kits right here until I
move on to like that collection and what
I should do with them so I just have my
Anasazi a little kit and then my Jaclyn
hell I'm Becca which I love so I'm just
going to leave those there for right now
here are the eyeshadow palettes that I
need to remember to try and we're going
to call it good hey so I think that's
all I'm going to do for this vlog
because I'm sure it's probably going to
be long enough so this blog will be
organizing with me just my eyeshadow
palette collection in a little bit of
highlights but honestly that was like
super overwhelming for me like I got
really frustrated several several times
like I said this just isn't it's not
what I'm good at and I don't know like
he just doesn't come naturally to me
like this it's just not what I'm great
at so you know you're when you're not
really like good at something it's not
necessarily fun to do I'm just really
grateful for all of the organization
that was send to me and I'm excited for
like the end product like I said I'm
excited to see what my office will look
like once I get everything organized but
it's just going to be a struggle to get
there so I'm trying to think what I
should try to organize next week I think
I want to work on the desk behind me and
figure out what I want to do with it
like do I want to keep those two
spinners on there
do I want to put some of the acrylic
drawers on there not exactly sure so I
might try to come up with a good game
plan before I start to film that so I
think maybe that's what I'll try to
focus on in my next organize with me
Vologda what you guys want to see or if
there something else for my makeup
collection that you'd want to see me
organized or again if you have any tips
or ideas for me they would be totally
appreciated I hope that you guys like
this vlog I'm not really sure how it's
going to go and I guess I'll just have
to see once I start editing how we do
but a lot of you guys said that you
wanted me to vlog this organization
process so that's what I'm doing I don't
know if it'll be the most interesting or
the most fun to watch but but we're
giving it a try so we'll have another
writing vlog coming soon like I said in
the first vlog I will have one where I
talk more about my writing I'll have a
giveaway in that blog which I'm really
excited about in some fun are writing
book news to share and that one too so
that one will be coming sometime and
then another organization vlog so my
hope is to do a vlog maybe once a week I
thought this one came a little bit later
because I was just like trying to
mentally prepare doing this organization
because it's just not to my cup of tea
but I'll try to do one once a week and
maybe posted on like Friday or Saturday
so you can have like a weekend vlog but
yeah let me know your thoughts in the
comments down below I hope you enjoyed
it Aries had such a fun time organizing
she just she was such a big help for me
so that's great
but I hope that you guys enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching and for
requesting another vlog and I'll catch
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
