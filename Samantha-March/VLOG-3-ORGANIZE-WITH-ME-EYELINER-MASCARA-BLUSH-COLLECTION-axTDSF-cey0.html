back to do some more organizing for my
third vlog if you have missed either of
my other vlogs I'll have them linked
down below but in last week's vlog we
started to take on the challenge of
organizing my office organizing my
makeup collection because it's turned
into a bit of a disaster and I've had so
many times comments on that so thank you
guys I'm honestly like really
uncomfortable doing this video like not
uncomfortable like I feel like I'm being
forced to post or you know anything like
that but I'm uncomfortable during the
process of doing this because I'm not
good at this kind of stuff I don't have
a knack for organizing I don't have a
knack for design I'm a clutter person by
Nature it just it just is what I what I
am I can't help it but I really wanted
to have you know a better setup for my
makeup collection and just be better
organized and I thought if I could blog
this it would keep me motivated and you
know just kind of keep me on track and
and that sort of thing so thank you guys
for all the nice comments and for the
suggestions I got so many suggestions on
things like placement and and you know
things like that I just I really do
appreciate those and take everything
into consideration because like I said
this is it one's good at so when your
comments and suggestions come in I
really do appreciate that so for today's
vlog I honestly don't have a kind of
time I'm doing this on a Tuesday so I
have my sand volleyball league tonight
I'm also going live at 4 o'clock I'm
going to start doing the live streams
every Tuesday at 4:00 CST I also need a
filmer makeup tutorial with the dragon
hill palette and I need to film a video
regular video for YouTube so we have a
lot to do today
but what I wanted to do was just a few
very simple things mostly focusing on
like my eyeliners mascaras Beauty
sponges and maybe a few other things if
I have enough time but I do still need
to eat lunch to but I actually was going
to do that this weekend I had it all
planned out I was going to get this done
and film it for a vlog and then on
Friday I got the freaking
jacqueline hill and morphe palette and
that just kind of turned my weekend
upside down so I mean that just my
weekend plans basically went out the
window when I got that I was so
unexpected I have my review video up of
it right now but palette goals will have
gone live Wednesday of this week so let
me know if you guys got it but yeah that
was crazy just trying to work as hard as
I could to try all these different
eyeshadows on my eyes in 24 hours so I
could film a review video and get it
edited and getting it up so my weekend
was just insane so exciting it was so
cool so much fun to get that palette and
to make that video was so so cool but
definitely in my office and just my
health and general kind of suffered from
it and if I sleep schedule too but so I
wasn't able to do the vlog so I really
wanted to get it done
at least today so I can try to have this
video up for the weekend maybe Friday or
Saturday so we're just going to do a
couple things here and there but I
figure it's still good to stay in a
rhythm of doing this at least once a
week I feel like that is really
important and then I thought you know
maybe just get a couple of smaller items
out of the way maybe it'll be less
overwhelming because you promised on
last week's vlog if you caught it
I was so super overwhelmed doing my
eyeshadow palette collection I just was
very very overwhelmed so I'm like maybe
if I do a few smaller things it won't
make me as like stressed out maybe so
that's what we're going to do today so
what I have feel as my camera is like
not very stable today on this tripod I'm
not sure what's going on so what I have
is this little container this is from
what Nicki sent me if you didn't catch
my first vlog I will leave it listed
down below as well but the first vlog I
did some on boxing one of them wasn't
from my friend Mickey and she sent me a
bunch of organization stuff also another
company is always been linked down below
I think their name is like song minks
song mics they send me some stuff too so
I have this acrylic container down here
as well but Mickey also sent me this too
so these are just the three things that
I grabbed out I didn't even bring the
whole box down because I didn't want to
get overwhelmed again so I just grabbed
out these three items in here I think I
want to put like my eyeliners and my
a mascara right now I just have my
mascaras and this like little spinny
thing and I have too many mascaras
they're like spilling out there's like a
mascara back here like it's just kind of
a disaster and for my eyeliners I have
them in one of these spinny containers
but this is like so freaking
overwhelming I mean I know like some of
you like get anxiety over this kind of
stuff so like turn away because I mean I
don't even get real anxiety over like
clutter and stuff because like I said
that's like how I live but this like
freaked me out so so many different
eyeliners here and I'm never being able
to like find the right one and there's
just no organization and like these top
things they don't like fit very well so
like I'm not I'm like stacking things
together like I do hear it like when I
spin it things fly off and it's really
annoying so we're going to try to
organize those in the little container
that I showed you again we have areas
here who is helping me out are you going
to be like during this vlog are you
going to sleep like you did the whole
last vlog because that was a little
ridiculous
okay so this is my pile of mascaras and
eyeliners and see like I feel like this
isn't super overwhelming I feel like I
can handle this going to organize them
and this little guy this pile is all my
eyeliners so I thought maybe to put like
ones with color in one little section
and then like Browns and blacks in
another so see so in this tile we have
my Sigma pink liner I've been using it a
lot lately - so cool I love this liquid
one from Milani it's one of those stay
put mattes and it's in like a dark green
and then I have two from Marc Jacobs -
hi liners one is in blue and one is in
green it's over tan Odyssey and then
these three are from colour-pop so I
have Vesto which is a burgundy which
this one is crybaby it's like a lilac
and then maybe which is a green and then
this one is from Rimmel and it's just a
nude so so I'll just put those in one
little corner like that for my Browns
and blacks I was thinking of maybe doing
one little section with like kind of my
go-to like the ones that I use most
often and then the ones I don't use as
much and another one so like the color
pop mr. Bing is a really pretty brown I
use it all the time my DHC liner I've
been absolutely raving about this
definitely need that one this is the
Tarte double tank I don't really love
the liquid side one side is like a
regular liquid liner I don't love that
side but the gel side is really good for
the waterline and stays put really well
so these seria probably used the most
out honestly I don't have to say these
are like my three go to the NYX
collection noir black liner is pretty
good actually so I'll put that one in
there and then also the Maybelline
master precise I've gone through
probably I don't even know like four of
these so those are kind of like my go-to
salsa fills in one section and then the
other ones I have the NYC liquid liner
which I really don't like all that much
I have one from unique it's like a brown
liner it's okay and then I have a deck
of scarlet liner I wasn't like a huge
fan but it's alright
this benefit they're real liner again
not the biggest fan but it's alright the
Maybelline master precise now the
Maybelline master graphic eyeliner this
is an interesting eyeliner like on days
and I'm feeling adventurous I would
reach for it the elf liquid liner in
brown it is pretty good and then I just
got this one from La Bella Donna so I'm
testing it out I will put those section
right here so we have colored liners
everyday black brown liners and then
other select Brown liners okay and then
we have my mascara pile right here so I
do have a lot of minis because I love
minis like I have no problems with like
mini anything when it comes to makeup so
I'm thinking maybe I could put the minis
in one section and then the full sizes
in another so I have the Smashbox
x-rated mascara which I love the pure
fully charged mascara I think that one's
okay
the pure big look I haven't even tried
this one yet
my YSL the shock mascara which is
amazing too faced better than sex
classic mascara the pure triple threat
again I need to try that one this one is
from blink it's their mascara amplified
it's like a tube mascara it's alright
and then the benefit they're real which
is like staples those in this little
section right here so I'll fit and then
these are my other mascaras so for this
one again
maybe I'll deal because I have two
sections left like maybe I'll do ones I
use more and then once I use less so the
ones I use more benefit roller lash for
sure the Maybelline lash sensational one
quite a bit
the Too Faced better than sex I
definitely do use that one a lot and
then if I had to pick because I have
five left the Lancome Hypnose drama I
really do like that mascara so those are
going to go in one little guy and then
my other one so I do have a full-size of
the pure fully charged my Sigma pink
mascara it is a pink mascara super fun
also this one is from Sigma it's a green
mascara and then the Max Factor master
precise mascara so now we have this
little guy filled with eyeliner and
mascaras and I think it will just be a
lot easier for me to find and grab now
that they're in our own little sections
instead of being like everywhere over my
office so whoa I just went ahead and put
it on my door so it's going to go for
now a lot of these things probably
aren't in their final resting places but
until I have everything organized I just
need to put them someplace for now so
that is sitting in my little corner on
top of my printer next to a few I show
palette okay so the next thing I wanted
to get done micki sent along this nice
little glass jar and she said they could
be for my beauty blenders because
somebody may or may not be looking at
this lazy dog she likes to eat Beauty
blenders that's her thing so I didn't
really have any good place to put them
where I had just been putting them is
again back to this like Spinney
organizer stuffing them in here and then
trying to make sure that that's always
turned to the back but there's been
times where I've caught areas with her
paws up here spinning this with her nose
to get the Beauty blenders like are you
kidding me they're just all the beauty
blenders that I'm working with right now
I'm pretty good at trying to get rid of
them when they get too old or too dirty
if they get rips in them or anything so
these are just the ones that I have
right now this one and they're all dirty
because this is real life I'm not going
to like pretend I'm really amazing at
cleaning my Beauty blenders I do always
clean them before you so I don't reuse a
dirty Beauty Blender sometimes I try
after I wash my makeup but again I'm
like in soap here 90 days
that's not real life so this is my
lore'l sponge which I absolutely love we
have two of the more few flawless
sponges I bought one myself and my
friend Jordan sent one to me because she
knows how much I love them and I do -
from bio Bell Cosmetics they sent me a
little set with some of their sheet
masks and they also included this it's
very hard it's not the best one ever but
it is actually kind of nice for playing
like baking powder underneath your eyes
because it's kind of like more firm not
great for like foundation or concealer
but if you bake you know it's decent for
that this one is the Real Techniques
diamond sponge which is super duper
clean check that out love the sponge I
use it all the time I love all the
difference like grooves and stuff on it
I talked about this one a lot you can
find it at Alta this is a good ol beauty
blender like classic beauty blender in
black so that is what we have so far so
can just go ahead and pop these in here
and I think they will all fit in here
which yeah and then I can put the little
lid on and have a home for my beauty
blenders woohoo that's kind of Awesome
actually I really really enjoy this idea
probably like once I get done cleaning
them like they probably wouldn't fit
like super large but usually when I
clean them I just leave them sit out on
my desk like on a paper towel or on the
bathroom sink on a paper towel until
they're dry and then I can pop them into
their little home so hey that's awesome
that worked out really well I think six
I mean it could probably fit another one
but I feel like six is probably a good
number did we have six yeah six yeah
good number it's going to set this on my
bookshelf for now since we are slowly
working on this organizer which I
actually had this in my bathroom first
and I had skincare in it and then I
needed to bring it down to my office for
my makeup collection but my hope is to
actually get all the makeup out of this
into a different home and to get backups
in my bathroom for skincare so I'm just
going to put the beauty blenders right
here for right now
until they find their final home can you
guys hear this dog snoring yeah series
we're looking at you my goodness you're
so clothed so so I'm still feeling
pretty good so I am going to move on to
the third thing that I grabbed out
I think it's again because I'm taking
like these like really small steps that
might seem so tiny but in the long run
you know they need to get done and it's
helping me not be so overwhelmed so this
is from the company song mix which I'll
have it linked down below and you can
get it on Amazon also and it's just a
little too acrylic drawer here what I'm
thinking is I have a bunch of like
single blushes that I could put in one
side or maybe both I don't have to see
how many I have but my simple blushes
are like insane so I'll show you one of
these little powers I have some blushes
here I have these two hour blushes that
might be the only single blushes like
that's a blush palette I honestly I've
been finding myself using the palettes
more so I thought maybe if I could start
with single blushes it might help me
but then this jar oh yeah we have two
Milani ones right here that I almost
forgot about just shopping things like a
boss okay so oh wait I got some color
pop shadows here is all very tricky to
do one-handed okay those are from
colour-pop this drawer is like so
embarrassing overwhelming all of the
above like half the time I can't even
freaking open this drawer it's just
insane
so these are all my single blushes and
again like I said I mean I do reach for
these quite a bit but I feel like I've
been reaching for my blush palette even
more so I thought maybe I could put them
in here so let's start everybody told me
when organizing I start from the biggest
so what would be the biggest maybe my
Sigma blush in porta Rosa really liked
that one this one is a box it's really
strange or maybe this pixi one next this
is in realm rose then maybe this benefit
one which is the dandelion blush that is
going on with like this tripod today but
my camera is like so loose on it
like I can't set it down and one of the
like legs keeps popping off so I can't
actually like prop it up anywhere
because this keeps falling off which is
great because this is very important for
when I go live on YouTube in a couple
hours so that's a lot of fun so I put in
the benefit danda line and then the
wet-and-wild
ombre blush which I really like in my
sidebar you drink and then I have two
blushes from Milani what are they what's
the really popular one luminoso and then
like pink rosy or Dulce pink still say
pink so I feel like that's pretty good
maybe for this side so then on the other
side we can do some more stacking these
are color pop blushes and quarters and
then between the sheets and then I have
these left so this is my number 7 blush
in peach velvet which I really enjoy
and then we have this essence blush I
feel really liking essence they're silky
touch blush and then this is from tarts
and aparte I got it as part of my
birthday gift from Sephora and then this
is from Elizabeth Mott peach pink
show me your cheeks blush I got that in
an Ipsy bag and then this is the $1,000
blush from nice this is a gift that you
got last year for hitting vib Rouge at
Sephora so huh expensive little blush
right here with the tiniest blush a
little eyes so that fits in there I feel
like I could maybe add more items here
but like I don't know I feel like for
now this will be good enough I just
wanted something to do with my single
blushes because I feel like they're kind
of like hard to organize and maybe for
right now they can just go in here so
there we go have some blushes stacked up
in here and I like it because I mean
even if I have it I don't know where am
i put this yet but I can tell from the
top exactly what everything is like
maybe for like the milania's and the
color pops I'd have to pull out and
actually
see what shade it is but for everything
else I'll know exactly what it is so I'm
actually pretty excited about these it's
pretty cool I always wanted someone
acrylic organizing and you know this
side I can always fill up in case I get
any newer items so hey hey I'm happy
about that that's pretty cool so I'm not
going to actually end the vlog now I
haven't found a home for yet it's still
sitting on my floor but honestly I don't
know what's going on with that tripod
giving me so much anxiety and like right
before I went to flip this around to do
that ending the tripod just fell off the
camera like just off so I have to figure
out what's going on with that because
that is really uncool and I guess I'm
going live in a few hours and I use that
tripod so it basically just like
disintegrated and fell apart today so
that's a pretty neat so so now I'm
holding the camera like super awkwardly
so sorry for just like weird
outro but I really enjoy organizing
today probably because it was pretty
like simple and quick and not too
overwhelming
so that was I enjoyed today it
definitely had me not as stressed as
last week so I'm to say I'm glad that I
decided to still do the vlog today and
just get these little pieces done
because you know every part of
organizing no matter how big or small it
is it all has to be organized and it all
has to be done so even if it's smaller
steps you know it's still gonna help me
out in the long run so we got some
eyeliners organized mascaras Beauty
sponges and single blushes so hey that's
actually pretty good
so I hope that you guys enjoyed this
vlog and again like last week if you
have any like tips or suggestions for me
please just let me know in the comments
I don't know what we're going to
organized and next week I'll go through
everything and see what I think would be
good to go with next so we will see but
I hope that you guys enjoyed another
organized with me vlog I'm sorry Aires
wasn't in the vlog as much as she was
last week she is still sitting
underneath my desk just sleeping away
not sure if you can see her since it's
so dark under there but I mean I guess
then she pretty much overtook my blog
laughs like she thought maybe she would
stay out of the spotlight this week I'm
not sure maybe she'll make her
appearances again next week but I really
hope that you guys have been enjoying
these blogs and organ
I think with me it says we are in now I
feel like now we are really in like last
week we just started with a house but
now we are really in this organizing
game oh yes I will see you guys next
week for another little bit of
organizing thank you guys so much for
watching my vlogs I hope you will give
them a thumbs up and consider
subscribing if you are not a subscriber
