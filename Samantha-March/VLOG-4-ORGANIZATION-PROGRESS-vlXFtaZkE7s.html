and back with another vlog excuse me my
fourth vlog I am going to make a vlog
playlist so I will have the playlist
listed down below catch up on any of
them but I am back to do more organizing
I have been trying to organize my makeup
collection and my office space and these
past couple blogs has been fun to do
these as vlogs because I feel like it's
just more casual that is what I'm gonna
be doing today
I've pulled out a few more containers
like what I did last week I just
organized like small sections of my
makeup collection and it helps me not
get overwhelmed because if you've been
following the vlog series I'm not very
good at organizing and I get very
overwhelmed very quickly so I noticed
that doing it in smaller sections has
been helping me so I went through and I
picked out a couple of containers that I
think could work for what I want to
organize today and we're just going to
fill those up and see how we do and I'm
excited about it I think I'm going to
try to work on my single highlighters
and then some things like primers things
like that
and maybe even start delving into my
lipstick lipstick collection which is
going to be really overwhelming I my
lipstick collection is definitely
probably going to be one of the hardest
things - the eyeshadow palette because I
have so many lipsticks but I thought if
I could even break down my lipstick
collection and start putting little
pieces together here and there it might
help me from getting overwhelmed I know
if you guys follow me on snapchat or
even like Instagram I've been sharing
some photos you've seen that I got a lot
of PR this past weekend which was like I
don't I don't even have words for like
all of the PR that I received as you can
is absolutely insane but for a lot of
those you won't see them in my makeup
collection video what I'm really trying
to organize is what I already have out
and when I get new products I kind of
have them in like a special area aka all
these boxes home LeFleur is my special
area so I can take photos I remember to
put them in haul videos and just
remember to try out the product so I can
review them so I don't actually put
things into my collection collection
until I feel like that process
done so a lot of those packages because
I know some people ask me like well
don't you get this or don't you help
this too it's probably in my testing
section so I don't forget to do it and
doesn't just get lost in my collection
so if you see something that maybe
you've seen on snap or Instagram or
something like that but you're not
seeing it being in this blog collection
series it's because it's in that area
for the time being so how much legend
guys know excite did get a few questions
on that but why don't we go ahead and
just let's get started let's just let's
just do areas are you ready did some
vlogging here I did some organizing
ready was gonna stay there all right
that's cool
so this is what I pulled out to start
with today I have these little mini
organizers these were all sent to me
from my friend Mickey D's on my first
vlog I did like subscriber mail unboxing
and she sent me a bunch of organizing
stuff and this one is from the company
that sent me a box as well those
featured in my second vlog it's called
song mix and you can turn them on Amazon
so I'll have their page elicit down
below in case anyone is interested but I
was thinking so this is kind of like the
order that I have set up and we'll just
see how much we can get done cuz you
know I don't know I also I always seem
to be filming these on Tuesdays and then
right after this I have to do my makeup
to get ready to go live because I do a
live stream every Tuesday at 4:00 CST
and then I also go to my volleyball
league on Tuesday so don't always have a
ton of time but that's okay I will to
see how much we can get done so what I
was thinking of doing in here is my
single highlighters I have a bunch of
single highlighters so I'll show you
what I have right now because they're
just kind of spaced out everywhere so I
have some highlighters in here I have a
mini highlighter in here these two are
both highlighters as well and then I'm
not sure if I have any in this one yet
on diamond glow powder so oh my Marc
Jacobs highlighter and this drawer that
I showed last week is like super super
crazy with highlighters so
I'm just going to pull out all of my
single highlighters in here I'm skipping
over like highlight palettes like this
one I'm just going to do single
highlights for right now okay so these
are all of my single highlighters some
thinking maybe to do kind of more like
the traditionally shaped ones in here so
this is a makeup revolution highlighter
I feel like maybe that's one of the
biggest ones and then this is a Becca
and champagne pop highlights and then
this one is from essences or pure nude
highlighter is so so pretty and then
this one the bomb mary loumanizer my
very first highlighter issue and then
these two from pixie and the Aspen over
to collapse look fit and there and then
maybe we could do I don't know like the
Becca and then the this one as those are
like H traditionally shaped so those all
fit in there and then I have these ones
up here I don't know these have like a
little container guy in it but I can
take that out if I want to what they fit
and once I feel like this Marc Jacobs
one it's going to be kind of hard to fit
let me take out that divider and see if
I can make something happen here I don't
know if they'll be able to say oh yeah
stuff it's okay so there we can do
single highlights and then single
highlights was a bit of a weird shape so
hey that works out right that worked out
pretty well um so let's awesome okay so
there are my simple highlighters that
has me feeling pretty good I'm not going
to lie I'm things that I was thinking
about what this I actually wanted to
organize them last week but I didn't
have enough space I thought I could do
them where how I did my single blushes
but I didn't have enough room in the
containers but I was thinking about like
my setting powders and or my face
powders because those are kind of all
over my office too so in here I know
that I have a few of my studying powders
from here and then I think maybe my
other ones are all in this drawer okay
so like this like I'm talking about
like like baking powders like the loose
translucent powders and you know I have
one more though and then what I also
wanted to do was like my my space
powders either translucent powders or
like powder or foundations because I
don't have a ton but I have enough where
I feel like I can do something with them
of here I have baking powders like loose
powders and then these are face powders
like foundation powders and such like
that so I don't know we will be able to
fit them all in here but let's see this
is my Maybelline master effect pretty
big so I don't know which way I don't
know how they're going to say this one
is my Tarte Amazonian clay powder I
really like that one my friend Lisa sent
it to me and I really enjoy it this is
my laura mercier secret brightening
powder and then this one is my Kat Von D
locket powder in peach so I'm not sure
the best way to fit everything in here
so let's just play around for a second
mm-hmm shoot shoot shoot maybe if I
could move oh I don't know if I can move
this divider okay I try to move the
divider but now I made it uneven so
let's see if it helps it although mm-hmm
this took the divider out but like I
still have these and I kind of wanted
them in the same place because we're
kind of same concept but I don't know
the best way to do it unless I just did
like this we have a Maybelline fit me
powder powder foundation the remote
translucent powder this is a winky love
face powder and then these are both from
Pierre it's there for in one pressed
mineral powder and it's like one of my
favorites that's why I have two of them
okay so that all fits I don't think it's
like the most organized looking drawer
ever but I feel like these are like
along the same concept so it would make
sense to put them together and I feel
like we have a pretty good amount of
space and they'll still be easy to grab
outside need anything like they're not
jammed in there
so that'll work so there is another
drawer okay I pulled out this guy as
well and I was thinking about maybe
doing my face primers because my face
primers like make no sense to me by are
not organized in any sort of the sense
because I have one just sitting here on
my bookshelf by itself and then I have
some other ones like crammed into this
metallic spinner that I really want to
clear out and put it back in my bathroom
for my skincare I also think I have some
wear today okay so here is more as well
like I mean they they're just all over
the place and we don't make any sort of
sense all right so these are all my face
primers like I said they were just like
spread out everywhere they they just
made no sense so when I was thinking
about what I could organize today I was
thinking of these guys so this is my
Kevin Daquan sensual skin primer so I'm
going to start with the eye cause it's
real big and then the milk makeup blurs
Jess which I really enjoy so these guys
are all kind of like the same shape so
the Too Faced primed and poreless the
Milani Prime shield
the Maybelline master prime the amazing
cosmetics anti-aging face primer and I
have the number seven airbrush away
primer the this is the pur cosmetics no
filter blurring primer and then this
little guy is the Tarte clean slate
primer which I really enjoy so I could
put them all like that and have these
cute little face primers all set up
should I should I like spaced them out
more like will it be annoying if I try
to reach in for a primer say so I can
either do that okay now my mind's now my
mind is kind of rolling because this
shape kind of had me thinking I have a
couple of like BB creams that are over
here in this drawer too so I have like
these BB creams and then like a tinted
moisturizer like they're all kind of the
same shape so I wonder if I could put
them in here but then would it be too
much I'm just trying to think of let me
see I don't know let me see if it would
be too much because then I don't want to
to be like really hard to get primers
out but I mean it's only three more
things and if I could make it work I
feel like that could be pretty cool so I
mean it definitely made it more crowded
but not crowded to like where I can't
reach for things and then maybe it'll
help even like kind of hold everything
up a little bit better
I don't also make any sense so there is
now my face primers and then also BB
creams and my illuminating primer from
Stila so illuminating moisturizer sorry
so yeah I don't know I might have to do
a little bit of finagling to get them in
the best spot but I feel like I like
that more not it's still not super
crowded but it will kind of help keep
everything together but again I feel
like those two can kind of go well
together so it's like why not just put
them all in one thing if it'll all fit
so okay so we got some primers some BB
creams in here
alright that went better than I thought
so that's cool
and then the last guy I have is this one
so it is three drawers you pull out like
this when I saw this I immediately
thought of like lip liners for sure and
then I was thinking about maybe my color
pop lipsticks because I have a pretty
big collection of color pop lipstick so
I was thinking maybe I could put them in
here and then I don't know how many
drawers my color pop lipsticks will need
though so maybe I will start with that
so let's start with my color pop
lipsticks which are all in this spinny
organizer right here I do have quite a
few so I'm just going to start pulling
out my lipsticks another goal of mine is
to clear out the white spinners and be
able to have just one down here for sure
like maybe both but maybe just one for
at least on my desk and then the rest of
my desk can have the acrylic drawers so
I'm trying to get these cleaned out as
well okay I think that's all of my color
pop somebody have you decided to help
let me just say this help us a you
decided to help out thank you okay let's
go either on my colourpop lip sticks
until I have a shade range that I love
so I'm going to put them in the first or
I'm not going to be like any particular
orders it's because I don't I don't even
know what kind of order I would do but
they all are basically Pink's nude nude
Browns that sort of thing so it's not
like I need to categorize them like by
pinks and reds and all that good stuff
so season here oh my gosh no way oh oh
oh
they almost all fit there's just I mean
they fit just like one kind of pops up
that's pretty cool actually they fit so
well I can't believe that I'm pretty
happy with that that's cool there's just
one like it just doesn't like completely
flat but almost so that's pretty cool
and then for another drawer I'm thinking
about doing my lip liner it's really not
a big lip liner person but I've
definitely been getting more into them
and then for some reason I still buy
them or sometimes they come in said
there sometimes I get sent things so I
have them in this little lipstick
acrylic organizer over here on my
bookshelf I did have so many that I
couldn't fit them all I had just don't
lying in front of the organizer so I'm
just going to take all these lip liners
and see if we can fit them in the drawer
as well see I feel like when I do this
it really doesn't look like that many
especially compared to other people but
I also just did get a bunch of Mac ones
which again I'm not going to do anything
with until I can go ahead and do a video
and swatches and test out formulas and
things like that so think about putting
them in the second drawer so hold on um
they don't really fit shoot well I think
I'll have to put them in this way which
is fine again I'm not really concerned
with any particular order I know some
people might like do things like color
coordinated or Fred Berean but honestly
I'm just going to date like when I want
something
I'm just going to dig in and grab it
like so for me there's really not a huge
point in organizing especially for me
something like my lip liners so I reach
for you know not on a super frequent
basis so I'm okay with them kind of
being a little bit sporadic but those
are my lip liners I mean I have a bunch
from the NYX like this one is Jordana I
have some color pop ones si edit that
came in a sephora favorites I think we
have deca scarlet I have a couple ones
oh I do have this one from Mac this is
my very first Mac purchase was the world
lipliner
they heard everyone talk about it I have
some from bite Beauty the pure one if I
didn't mention I really do like that one
who Beauty Kylie cosmetics so those are
some of my lip liners so I am going to
see okay so those that works pretty well
like I don't know I don't feel like I
reach for my color pop lipsticks a ton
but I still think having them on the top
drawer is a good choice because I do so
like them and then my lip liners seconds
and then then this drawer we have so let
me do a few minutes of thinking this one
through and what I could put in here I
want to keep it still lipstick because I
feel like that would make sense but what
lipsticks could I do I decided to focus
on diesel six in here these are kind of
like my drugstore lipsticks - my Sigma
Beauty one so I'm just going to set the
Sigma one aside for a second but a lot
of these in here are like my Maybelline
lipsticks and I think I have a go
wet-and-wild in here too but they're
just like shoved in here so I'm going to
see if I can put them in a drawer and if
they'll fit it won't have like two too
many here but again I have like
maybelline ones these are all Maybelline
and then a wet and wild and then a
L'Oreal so these are all regular
lipsticks - and again not that I don't
reach for them a ton but I definitely
reach for them less than my liquid
lipsticks so I'm just going to put the
Maybelline once in first
Maybelline lipstick like regular formula
lipsticks is actually one of my
favorites I bought a ton when I first
started getting into makeup and then we
have this one in Blake's red and then we
have the wet wild bear at all so hmm
so I wonder if I have more I heard no no
yeah I do now I do my little acrylic
organizer first I was thinking about NYX
but I have quite a few Nicks ones and I
just got a huge package from NYX but
these two are both Maybelline they're
the color jolts and I bet that they
would a little bit yeah look at that
that's like a drugstore little drawer
JumpStart drawer drugstore lipstick
drawer hey this is so cool okay hold on
let me look at it when I look at it all
okay so we got color pop satin and altar
lips lip liners and then drugstore
lipsticks Maybelline's malarial wet and
wild maybelline hey that's pretty cool I
really I actually really liked Widow
doesn't that look cool I feel like that
was like legit you know something that
has me pretty excited I have cleared out
the majority of this the only thing
that's in there is a pencil sharpener
for my lip pencils and then my
Physicians Formula butter bronzer or not
butter bronzer bronze booster so I'm
going to put this maybe in that dust
drawer for now because then I will have
completely cleaned this out which means
that I can move it back upstairs to my
bathroom for skincare unless I think
when as I'm organizing I think that I
still do need it but I really did like
this for my skincare and it made my
bathroom vanity look a lot more
organized so that really actually
excites me because I took out lipsticks
I took out face primers and I took out
BB creams from this organization trip so
that's pretty cool actually and I feel
like I'm slowly working through that
desk drawer which is good too
so because eventually what I kind of
like to do is to be able to put some of
like these trays into that desk drawer
because I think they would be able to
it well so this is what we did today and
I'm pretty happy with it because I was
just explaining it on my snapchat when I
was taking a little break that really
all I did differently this time I felt
like was before I started filming I just
took a second and went through and start
like what really bothers you what what
bothers you about your collection and
like the one of the first things I
thought of was my face primers because I
had some on the bookshelf some on the
desk some in a drawer like it just
didn't make any sense and then also like
single highlighters they were everywhere
so I thought about single high layers
over here sorry single highlighters I
was think about them because they were
everywhere and then my lipstick
collection definitely overwhelms me
because it's so big and I thought if I
could break it down it could be easier
so I'm actually pretty excited about it
it took me like a solid five minutes
just to try to like think through things
and I mean even though some things
didn't quite fit exactly how I thought
they might fit it's still I was able to
take those out of my collection so if
you're someone like me who gets
overwhelmed just take you know
sorry ten minutes and think about what's
really bothering you out of your
collection right now and then see what
you can do with it because that actually
was a lot more simpler than I thought it
could be and then this is kind of our
final result for today's organization
and then we even have an empty center
now so ah I feels really good
hey thanks for helping organize to your
you're a really big help so I hope that
you're enjoying your bench does that is
that softbox bothering you but it's
right in front of your face or you like
it like that alright cool so I'm
actually going to go ahead and end a
blog here and I am just like stoked
right now I hope I can keep this feeling
always long until I start organizing it
next week I think this weekend's going
to be pretty busy too
with it being kind of like the July 4th
weekend and such we do have some plans
so it'll probably be next Tuesday
hopefully when art is actual for so I
don't know we might have to see but
hopefully next week when I organize I
hope I can keep this feeling of just
take a few minutes think about what you
want to actually organize and like what
pieces from your collection you want to
organize and then it just go for it and
I
like today have me in like pretty good
spirits so that's super exciting I mean
I know I definitely have a lot more to
go of course and I really want to get
these white spinners all organized out
and cleaned and then I really want to
get that desk drawer cleaned out so but
I mean honestly I feel like I've done a
pretty good job I'm really excited for
today's vlog so hopefully you guys
enjoyed it and enjoyed seeing me
organized a few more things we did
single highlighters face powders primers
BB creams my color pop lipsticks lip
liners and some of my drugstore
lipsticks so I think today was a pretty
good day and since I can take that
spinner off my bookshelf I'm going to
stack some of these organizers in its
spot right now so I'm pretty happy about
that as well as well have a good place
to be able to put these for the time
being until they find you know it's
probably not going to be until the end
until everything is really organized and
in their home so I'll find like the
final resting places for them these I'm
sure things will change and switch
around and things like that so I'm
pretty excited I hope that you guys
enjoyed this week's vlog and seeing me
organize some more of my makeup
collection
hopefully I will have another vlog up on
Friday with the holiday weekend
and doing some activities and such I'm
not for sure but I would like to try to
keep on the Friday vlog schedule so
hopefully I can do that I get my
playlist for the other vlogs will be
