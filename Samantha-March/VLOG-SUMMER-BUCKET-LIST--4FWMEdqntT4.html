am going to try to start blogging again
I don't know if this will see the light
of day but I'm going to go ahead and
give it a try if you guys have been
following me for a while i was doing
vlogs previously like organizing my
office and such I've kind of put that on
hold until I can get some shelves or
another desk in here and working out a
few options right now because it's
getting out of control again I think
it's just out of control like I don't I
don't even know what I'm supposed to be
doing at this point I like how I would
keep organizing until I find some more
storage space in here because it's crazy
not that I'm complaining complaining but
there just needs to be a few more things
before I can organize because those
vlogs would just be like a hot mess but
I thought what I could do so I talked
about this in my like summer makeup
bucket list video and that video was
inspired because my friends and I
created our own summer bucket list with
different like restaurants to try
activities to do trips to take things
like that and we've been working the
past couple weeks through our bucket
list and we have one thing that we know
two things that we're doing tonight from
the bucket list and then we have kind of
like a small party going on this weekend
but I thought I could take you guys
along with that and you know show you
some of the things that we're doing
around our town in Iowa and just like a
little glimpse into my life kind of
thing instead of being more of like a
structure type of vlog just doing some
more like casual into my life kind of
vlog so let me know if you guys like
that idea I just got home I had to run
to Verizon if you guys follow me on
snapchat I know I mentioned it on
YouTube obvious if you follow me on
twitter then you've been seeing me just
like blow up Verizon because I'm so
frustrated with them we keep getting
charged data like wow we're home
sleeping on Wi-Fi only my husband's
phone from like 4:00 to 5:00 a.m. it's
using like almost a gig of data like our
data is through the roof and Verizon's
like you guys should just switched on
limited data for two people one who
works from home no no no no I don't
think we need unlimited data I think you
need to fix your is what I
and and it's funny though because I said
it on snapchat and so many people
started coming back with Verizon do the
same thing to me
they fall behind this oh you must have
weak Wi-Fi signal again only Mitch's
phone God my phone is being affected
just midget on and we're on the same
Wi-Fi but okay sure thing Verizon so
that like you must have weak Wi-Fi
signal and everybody's like they're
saying the exact same thing to me so we
switch to another company and everything
is fine our data is completely fine all
of us in our Wi-Fi signal is fine with a
different company I'm like okay so I
went in today mostly fir to trade my
phone because I just got the new like s8
or whatever and the guy said to come in
and trade in my phone which of course
that didn't make any sense to me because
when I went in to get my phone there
were like oh if you trade it in it's
$300 and we put it in towards your
monthly bill like you won't actually get
the money it just goes to your bill and
it's only like 15 dollars a month for
the next year I'm like okay whatever so
I go in today and the guys like I can
give you 101 dollars and 50 cents in a
gift card I'm like can you guys just get
your story straight like just get it
straight get it together what is wrong
with you I'm like whatever just give me
the gift cards like Jesus and then I
switch to my plan there and it's so
funny that I was talking to the employee
and you know I'm a pretty happy person I
like to think I'm for every person but I
was just mad I didn't want to be there I
was so frustrated and as we were talking
he like publicly kind of goes oh did you
know that you're over your data
I go totes and you just kind of looked
at me I was like I've been fighting
what's Verizon all week on this issue
and you know now I've taken it to
Twitter and he goes are you roasting
them on Twitter like I like to think I
am ego stuff so cool keep roasting them
I'm like yo Verizon employee what do you
mean and he's like she goes I mean I
like my cell phone plan and I like that
the team I rent but I do not like this
company I'm like what like so many
people have snapped and sent me tweets
and even put on YouTube and I just keep
putting them all on Twitter like keep
sentiment I'll just keep putting them
out on Twitter I don't know if it's
going to do anything but like I hope it
does because it is ridiculous the amount
of shadiness that Verizon has
I was I just got home and I'm selling
all sorts of flustered I also had to
wait for 40 minutes to get help a
present at 10:30 on a Thursday afternoon
like oh okay sure thing so but other
than that I just got home traded in my
saw and changed my plan to 16 gigabytes
for two people one who works from home
on Wi-Fi but okay so we have 16 gigs now
we went from four four four burette it's
not bread and salt it's not residence
all there's nothing should be going on
yourself you okay girlfriend you all
right okay so anyways I'm just gonna I
don't know set the camera up throughout
my day I don't know if I'll be able to
get a workout in because that took so
long I was going to record some of my
workout but that might have to be for
another day cuz I'm about to make some
lunch I'm working on editing Saturday's
video I'm working on getting tomorrow's
video ready I have to do my makeup at
some point and then tonight we are going
to the des moines Botanical Gardens on
Thursday they have like drinks and food
and live music and things like that and
that's on our bucket list to do we've
never been to the Botanical Gardens and
then after that we are going to a ramen
place my husband Mitch actually put that
one on the list it's called like crunch
which or something like that
and it has a bunch of like ramen dishes
we've never been anything like that so
I'm super excited to give it a try so
I'll try to take you guys with me the
hard part for me to vlog
I mean hey like I don't blog and you
know I'm not comfortable yet and I know
a lot of people talk about this in their
vlogs like they feel weird with their
cameras on their tripods and talking to
a camera and and things like that so
that's definitely going to be weird but
I also don't know if I want to take my
sony a 5100 because if anything happens
to it
that's my only camera you know what I'm
saying so I might just bring my phone
and you know do some video clips on
there and like see how it goes and see
how I can even upload them to my
computer and stuff but I don't know I
might do that it just makes me a little
nervous to bring the so me out because
just if anything happened to it like I'm
pretty screwed filming videos and with
filming every single day you know I
definitely need a camera back to work
areas clearly just
busted so I don't know how much help
she's going to be to me today but I
might get back to work but yeah we'll
see how this vlogging thing goes now to
make some lunch earn a video to see
about the tops of the other day at the
grocery store and I didn't realize it
but it's actually Star Wars pasta so the
actual pasta noodles are shaped like I
think that Yoda I don't even know I'm
like cool that's that's what I do
so I do work from home full-time and
honestly I feel like one of the huge
benefits is like choosing what I want to
eat because before I went full-time and
I get asked a lot if I do youtube
full-time like I consider myself just a
full-time dreamchaser a full-time
entrepreneur because I do so many
different things I write books I worked
in like marketing the book industry I do
like a lot editing proofreading and
things like that and then I also do
YouTube when I do consider that to be
pretty full time I work really hard on
my channel my Instagram and my social
media things like that but so before I
went full-time at home I worked at
hospital I worked at a VA hospital and
it was always so hard meal wise like
it's so frustrating sometimes to figure
out what to bring in for work like
sometimes I would just have Lean
Cuisines there but then you have those
things where you eat a Lean Cuisine and
you feel like you ate a cracker and
you're like well I need more and then
you're going to like hospital cafeteria
and try and get food and or like some
days I would try to make my sandwiches
ahead of time but then by the time you
eat your sandwich like it's kind of
gotten soggy it just was always such a
hard thing and I don't think my husband
eats out every single day which I'm
trying to get him to stop doing I'm like
we have the means that you can make
something like I used to do these meals
a lot I would make them with a knife
before put them in a Tupperware I put
them in the fridge and then just grab
them and take them to work with medium
key them up I'm like you really need to
do something else because it's expensive
to eat out every day just seems
ridiculous I'm like it's not even good
for you like it's so bad because you
know it's not like he's like always
making the healthiest choices like yeah
sometimes he goes too so we're Jimmy
John's but sometimes it's like
chick-fil-a and Chipotle five guys I'm
just like how do you do like your body I
feel like if I would do that every
single day I don't even know on an
element like not even only just like
gaining weight but what does three on
the inside like that freaks me out I've
struggled with high cholesterol so just
thinking about eating that way just kind
of like wool I'm trying really hard to
give them stop but um but doesn't it
working from home like just eating being
able to choose right on what I want to
eat being able to like have the freedom
just like have time to make something
it's so nice and I don't always do the
best at it a lot of times I get a coffee
in the morning or sometimes I do like to
make smoothies so if we have like fruit
and stuff in the house I'll make us
somebody but even if for lunch a lot of
times I'm just so busy I'll just make a
turn being cheese sandwich and eat some
chips and you know that's that's my
lunch but we just went to the grocery
store last night and I bought this tops
and it's literally been on my mind ever
since so I thought I'd make the pasta
probably won't be able to eat all of it
but I figure if I have a little snack I
can eat it before we go to the event
tonight because we're not gonna be able
to eat dinner till later because we
probably won't get there until like 5:30
6:00 and it's just they have like small
plates or something like that but then
we want to have dinner at the crunch
which ramen place afterwards so we're
playing not going to have you know any
sort of early dinner so I thought I
could at least make somewhat of a decent
lunch and then either sell a big lunch
or be able to have a snack before we
have to leave the house so I'm not like
starving I'm used to eating dinner at
like 5:00 I swear like imaginaire I
don't know what we're just starving at
that time what time Isis if we ever got
to a restaurant they're usually pretty
not busy
really healthy lunch most because
there's peas in it but I'm not going to
eat the peas because I like peace so
just some chicken and some pasta today
we
just finished eating it is like 12:30
but I think for my makeup today
sometimes when I do my makeup I'm
filming for an Instagram tutorial and
those can just take longer to film but I
think I'm just going to film regular
makeup today and then film a YouTube
video so I think I'm gonna like let my
food settle for a little bit and I'm
going to do a workout Sara Lee do you
want to get I try to work out every
single day and obviously I know with us
being gone all night tonight I'm not
gonna be able to work out tonight so I
think I'm just going to skip them
Instagram tutorial that way I can fit my
workout in especially since I don't know
what I'm eating tonight and I'll
probably having a few drinks so today is
not a good day to skip a workout a show
on my snapchat my workouts but I use the
Crocker app I've been using this for
like three or four years or something
here comes areas I've been using it for
so many years it's just an app like this
is what it looks like when I pull it up
on my phone and then there's all these
different workouts you can do and you
have a calendar so I always add things
to my calendar so I can just come in
everyday and like see what's on my
calendar what I have to do next and that
sort of thing so and then I always take
a screenshot of it and I share on my
snapchat so today's workout I'm doing a
20-minute bar workout bar workouts are
so good for your legs in your butt oh my
gosh but they hurt so bad so I'm
probably not gonna be able to walk very
well tonight so just go ahead and
screenshot and I shared on my snapchat I
always have record listed down below
because you do have to pay for the app
but you can use it every single day like
if you're someone who works out at home
I really recommend it because it's a lot
cheaper than going to the gym or having
a gym membership they are having a
special right now if I'm an affiliate
with them you know because I love them
and I've used them for years they're
having a special right now for I think
like 20% off their one-year membership
so I always have gruffer a link down
below
I do have an affiliate links that you
can get a free two week trial if you
sign up with the link and then see how
you like it and if you would use it just
go ahead I'm going to show this on my
snapchat on the finish of this chapter
I'm always reading you will always see
me reading and then I'm going to get my
workout in
yes head on I work out my legs oh my

it's now Sunday the 23rd I don't know
how well I did
blogging this weekend I gave him my best
shot but I did not take my Sony camera
out I just like him just too paranoid
that I'm going to hurt it
so a lot of it was on my phone and I
don't know that's just like kind of
awkward especially holding it and I'm
just not great at vlogging yet I'm not
great at asking people to help me like
you know this is kind of weird but it
was some pretty good day hopefully I got
some good stuff at Botanical Gardens
because I was actually a lot of fun and
then we went to the ramen house that was
actually way good I really really did
like the ramen house and then Friday we
didn't do anything but Saturday we did
go to the smoke Lathon and I started to
vlog a little bit there but then we had
an incident happen
my friends were playing beer darts and
if you don't know what beer darts is
people like sit in a circle outside and
they have like a beer can basically by
their feet and then people around the
circle take turns throwing darts at the
beer can and I guess depending on like
wherever you hit like matters how much
you drink
I've never played because I don't want
people thorns darts at me okay like
that's not like a bad idea rattling who
masa do not know not me no thanks and so
I'm just sitting there watching and next
thing you know my best friend Shannon
has a dart embedded in her big toe okay
like so far in her toe I was horrified
like horrified and everyone's starting
to like jump up and run around like what
do we do and Shannon goes to pull it out
and then she realizes how deep it is in
her toe and she's like I don't know I
don't want to pull it out it's going to
bleed everywhere and it did and then
I don't believe your darts it just seems
like a bad idea I don't know oh my gosh
it was a girl it was so gross okay I saw
her today Sunday we had brunch today
which I totally meant to blogeee brunch
and I forgot I'm so sorry but we went to
brunch and she said that she can still
walk on it it's just swollen and pretty
sore but it seems like it'll be okay
hopefully but oh my gosh that happened
and then the rest of the night just was
kind of like how to funky vibe to it and
I didn't even bother to pull out my
camera so oh man oh man but I am going
to wrap up the vlog today and just see
how I did for these couple of days and
see if I'm able to put anything together
I'm hoping to try to vlog this coming
weekend - we're going to the Dubuque
County Fair we're doing on my volleyball
tournament we're doing a 5k and then
we're also I think we're going
rollerskating Friday night all three
things on our summer bucket list - so
I'm excited about it but it's about a
three and a half hour car right there so
I think we're going to leave Friday and
then the volleyball tournament isn't
until Sunday so we might actually just
spend the night there sunday - and head
back on Monday so I will try maybe I'll
even take my Soniya long I'm not sure
and then obviously at the fair I don't
know who's going to vlog us like doing
the 5k and the volleyball tournament
because we're all going to be doing it
but I will see what I can do but yeah
hopefully this vlog is somewhat cohesive
and makes sense and hopefully you enjoy
it you want to see more vlogs like this
of course I'll let me know and I could
try to get better at upload my camera
out and and things like that but yeah
just let me know in the comments down
below
you like the vlogs make sure to give
them a thumbs up I hope that you'll also
subscribe before you go and I'll catch
you guys real soon in my next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
