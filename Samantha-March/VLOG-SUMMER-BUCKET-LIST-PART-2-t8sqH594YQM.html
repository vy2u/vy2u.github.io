going to try to do another of a log I
just got done filming this and makeup
look for Instagram and I'm about to sit
down and film a video and then finish
packing we're going out of town let's
begin we are going to Dubuque Iowa I
used to live there my brother still live
there and some other family members and
my friend Matt is from east of you : oi
actually but it's literally like just
right across the bridge from a Dubuque
so he still have family there as well I
know we're saying what's his family this
weekend the four of us are driving up
today so that's our plan for the weekend
I'm going to see how much is logging I
can do for it I just have my camera
still set up on the tripod since I've
just got done filming those look but can
you finish a zoom in cool this book will
be on Instagram soon what was I going to
say but I'll try to take you along as
much as I can I'm still again once again
like debating if I should take my Sony I
have a feeling I won't but maybe I'll be
adventurous but yes tonight we're going
rollerskating that was on the bucket
list tomorrow we are doing a 5k and it's
like a mud run but obstacles and stuff
so that should be interesting and then
Sunday we have a mud volleyball
tournament I really have no idea what
else we're doing like are we going to
stay at the fair
that's where both of these events are
like they're we're going to stay at the
fair and go to the fair we're going to
do something else I don't know so I
really don't know how to pack and I've
definitely been struggling with it
it's definitely hard on the phone and
then some of my clips didn't really work
out so I wasn't able which really bummed
me out because I some the whole time in
the Botanical Center I filmed the whole
time at the ramen house I found a bunch
in the car and just a lot of the clubss
didn't come out so we'll see how I do
again this week but bear with me as I
get used to blogging and thank you for
all the kind of words they've already
seen coming in on the vlog that I posted
today Friday from last week so thank you
guys but um yeah I guess I will just
check in with you guys there later
we
hey guys so it's a what it's Tuesday I
talk first once of I just got done
filming so I still have my camera set up
here and for some reason the Sun coming
in is like blinding me at this moment I
don't know what that's about
but I realized as I was sitting here and
I was going to start uploading stuff
from the blog but I did do like any sort
of outro so I thought I would hop on
here and like say goodbyes because I
guess that's what you do in vlog this
weekend was probably one of the more
epic regions of my life that was crazy
we walked away from that weekend was so
many memories so what we were doing I'm
not sure how much I explained in the
beginning but what we were doing we've
been working on our summer bucket list
me and my husband he's the bearded man
in the videos my best friend Shannon and
then her husband Matt that's the four of
us that you're seeing a lot we decided
one night to create a summer bucket list
of just items that we wanted to do
places we want to see things like that
and we've just been working on checking
them off but we had on there a mud
volleyball tournament a 5k rollerskating
and eating at a marina and we are you
get to knock off all for those this
weekend we are really going back for the
mud volleyball tournament and the 5k and
then roller skating and eating at a
marina just kind of work there ways in
there which was fun but we left Friday
at the bus three and a half four hour
drive from Des Moines where we live to
Dubuque the newb is actually where I
used to live my little brother still
lives there when he's not traveling for
his job which he was traveling less
again which was a bummer Felson like
aunts and cousins and stuff interviews
too and then Matt is actually from east
of you which is an Illinois but it's
just right across the bridge if you
follow me on snapchat you saw that I was
in Iowa Illinois in and Wisconsin all
within like four hours or something
because they're all right there so we
stayed with Matt's mom who was such an
amazing hostess for us she was so
awesome she did a lot of like the
blogging for me at the volley ball which
was super cool so we went up there
Friday we got there Friday night maybe
around like 8:00 we would ski country
which was super fun because that's where
I used to go as a kid a lot so it
brought back so many memories we scared
it from maybe like an hour or so and
then we met up with some of Matt's
friends
my brother's girlfriend and we just
ended up staying out until 3 a.m. which
is a terrible decision in Illinois the
bars are open till I think 3:30 actually
whereas in Iowa they're only open till
2:00 so we ended up staying out till
3:00 a.m. and we had to wake up at 7:00
the next day because we were running a
5k mud run Saturday morning excellent
choice
so we got up and I remember Shannon
coming into the room where Mitch and I
were sleeping and she was like guys time
to wake up and my response was no that's
what I said I said no but we all got up
we made it out to the run and that was
super fine itself it was a 5k but it
also had obstacles in between so we had
to like jump over cars and run up these
hay bells and jump down them and climb
up these huge like vertical ladder
things and like army crawl through mud
and go down into this mud sand and use a
rope to climb our way out like it was
crazy it was so much fun but man we
struggled we struggled for like the
first 10 minutes of that thing that
whoo-hoo really but it was super
fun I'm really glad we did it I don't
think any of us had done a like mud run
challenge thing before so it was really
fun to do together and you got to go
down this like slip and slide thing that
had like a tarp with water and you slid
down this hill it was really scary I
screamed the whole time but it was
really fun I'm glad that we did that and
then you know we go back and we get
showered we ate brunch out of arena
which was on our bucket list as well
we ate brunch and then we were like
what's like let's do something else
that's fun and we ended up going to the
mines of Spain in Dubuque which is
basically just like a really big outdoor
you know you can hike and it has views
of the river because Dubuque is on the
Mississippi River and things like that
and like blood over looks and things so
we took like a random and prom to hike
and you know just saw a couple sights
there then we ended up at a winery and
Jana and I did some wine tasting and
then the guys decided that they wanted
to go into Wisconsin because Wisconsin
has a beer called spotted cow it's only
sold in Wisconsin so we go over into
Wisconsin but they really wanted the
beer on tap for whatever reason I have
no idea why they wanted to be on tap we
went to the first bar
didn't have it we went to a second
birthday and have it we drove 30 minutes
into Wisconsin because they wanted beer
on tap and at this point Shannon they
aren't even drinking we just want to
like take a nap or so tired from only
getting four hours of sleep running a 5k
mud run and now going out all morning
we're like oh my gosh we were so tired
we're not really driving into Wisconsin
but we did and we had a great time we
were into a wedding party the waitresses
were super nice like it ended up being a
really good time but it was so
completely random which is that's
usually one like the best times they're
had so then we finally come back we
clean up get ready we go out to dinner
with some friends we went to the casino
and then we found a karaoke bar and then
we stayed out until 3 a.m. what is wrong
with us I'm like this is a terrible idea
because we had to wake up at 7 again
because we had to do to the fairgrounds
at 8 o'clock to check in to play mud
volleyball why do we say also 3 god I
don't know why is my voice fun oh
because I was singing frigging Smash
Mouth and the Lincoln Park karaoke in a
car at 3 in the morning like yeah yeah
together so many bad decisions were made
but it was super fun something I like
literally they closed down the karaoke
bar they're like ok that's it we were
like this is not it and we started
seeing that somebody was television show
like and everybody joined in the entire
bar sir is singing with us and people
are looking at us like we were just the
most amazing people on the planet
clearly we were so that happened
so then 7:00 in the morning rolled
around and we just all feel worse we
feel so much worse than we did the night
before because we're already running on
low sleep and then we just repeated it
we check in a mud volleyball and buy
some sort of grace of God we get a first
round bye
which I think saved us because otherwise
I don't know like I don't know what we
would have done Shannon I ended up going
to McDonald's for breakfast my husband
was sleeping on the ground for a while
we were kind of a hot mess but then we
started playing and then we just kept
waiting we did lose one set so we went
to the losers bracket but then we kept
winning again we actually got fourth
place total out of 17 teams which
I'm bad and if we would have won our
last game we actually woulda placed like
we would have got in third place and I
guaranteed 100 bucks like okay I don't
know how we pulled that off honestly no
idea how we pulled that off but we ended
up playing from like 932 I don't know
two thirty three classes our last game
maybe and was so exhausting my body hurt
I mean obviously you're covered in mud I
think I have some blog footage that I
had in here but I can maybe pop in some
pictures too oh my gosh it was it was so
crazy that was our first time playing my
volleyball and it was so much fun I
would totally do it again super hard
much harder than you know regular
volleyball but at the same time just
hilarious we had a great time we none of
us could believe that we plays fourth
with how we showed up at the fair like
other people couldn't believe that we
plays for so they were like you were the
crew rolling in this morning or like yes
that was us got fourth place like I feel
like we should have won something
anyways for like Most Improved or
something I don't know but it was really
fun and I think honestly if we would
have won and we would have won money we
probably would have gone out again
because we all said Monday off because
we didn't think we would come back until
Monday with the mud volleyball being on
Sunday but we decided to grab dinner and
then just head back out of town so we
could wake up early get our dogs from
where they are being boarded and stuff
and probably it probably helped us out
though we did win any money because we
probably just went ahead a freaking
three I'm repeat again and I probably I
don't even know what kind of shape I
would have been in after that so
probably wasn't a bad thing that we
didn't win any money ended up just
driving home we had dinner and then got
back on the road but we didn't get back
until I think like midnight I honestly I
fell asleep in the car I'm so tired
I think we got back around midnight and
then I was up at 7:00 to go pick up Ares
from her daycare where she was being
boarded at but it was such a fun weekend
so many so many memories so many things
off the bucket list I'm exhausted
I'm still trying to recover and it's
Tuesday my husband has an infection in
at the eye his feet our tour of because
at one point he had to take off his
shoes playing my volleyball his feet are
tore up I have scratches all down one of
my legs my body hurts but it was a lot
of fun and I'm really glad that I did it
and hopefully it made for somewhat of a
fun vlog but
I'm not sure we don't have anything
planned for this weekend but I know
coming up we have a couple of different
things that we're going to be doing so
whenever we're doing like summer bucket
list activities or in doing anything
other than just sitting at my desk I'll
try to vlog it and see what I can put
together so as of right now I'm not sure
