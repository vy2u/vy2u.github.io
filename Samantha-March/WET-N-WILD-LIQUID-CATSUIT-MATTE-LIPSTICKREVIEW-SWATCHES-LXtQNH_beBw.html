today's video is going to be a review
and a few swatches on the new
wet-and-wild liquid cat suit matte
lipstick so these are new at the
drugstore drugstores coming out with a
lot of new products right now wet in
wild especially is coming out with a lot
of new stuff but they released some new
liquid lipsticks and I actually talked
about these in one of my past will i buy
it videos and i just had a ton of
comments on that video either asking me
to pick them up in a review or from
people saying that they've tried them
out and they're good or or saying that
they've heard that they're really good
so will I get something try them out so
I just looked at the amount of comments
coming in about these and was like okay
I'm gonna go try some out so I picked
them up last weekend I thought about
doing like a first impression and
swatches video but because they aren't
like super super new like there's
already a lot of videos out there about
them and a lot of people have been able
to try them out I thought that I would
try them out first I could actually give
you my feedback and my review in this
video as well as doing some swatches I
just picked up three different colors
there was not a huge shade selection
when I went so these were the only three
that I got but I'll swatch each one on
my hand and on my lips as well so you
can get idea of the colors that I was
able to pick up but I will also go
through and review them so if you would
like to hear my thoughts and see some
swatches on the wet and wild liquid
catsuit matte lipsticks please keep
watching okay so like I said these are
fairly new I mean what do they launched
like maybe a couple weeks back or so and
I had a lot of people asking me about
them that's why I put it in the will I
buy it video and then from the will I by
that video have the ton of comments so I
thought okay I'll just go ahead and
purchase them so I was able to get three
of them there was only seven shades
there I think there's like thirteen or
fourteen different shades there was only
seven shades that they had and two of
the shades were completely gone sold out
there wasn't any of them left so I
picked up these three and then the other
ones that they had were like real darker
colors so I don't normally gravitate
towards so they were $4.99 a piece I saw
some people saying I've seen them on
sale at their drugstores for $2.99 I'm
inside you do get point to 1 ounces in
each one just to compare them to some
other affordable lippies for color pop
you get point 11 ounces
and in a NYX soft matte lip cream you
get 0.27 so I don't know there you go
there's some little comparisons right
there
so looking at the wet and wild website
in the description it says what glides
on like butter feels like a second skin
and won't budge our liquid catsuit matte
lipstick it's made with glammed up
superpowers it goes on glossy yet
transforms and do a high pigmented matte
finish with some serious staying power
read our lips this color is going
nowhere so it's as it glides on glossy
transforms into high pigmented matte
finish it's a lightweight formula made
with serious staying power and intense
pigmentation without drawing the lips a
few other claims is vivid color and
ultra matte finish and comfortable wear
so those are the descriptions and some
of the claims I can go ahead and do some
swatches quick first so you can see them
and then I will give my like a little
review mini review on the lippies so the
ones that I have on right now is in
nudie patooty so this is what it looks
like on my lips it is incredibly nude I
mean it's not even it's not like a nude
Brown it's not like a nude pink it's
like the color of my skin
so here is what are the applicators a
look like on them okay so there is nudie
patootie on my hand like I said it's
very much like matches my skin color
which is kind of funny so I don't know
this one is I think a little too nude
for me like I love nudes love nudes if
you saw my best the beauty 2016 video
all of my favorite lippies are nudes
except for one pink wasn't there
but this is just to flesh toned nude for
me I would have to do some sort of
either lip liner with it or layer it on
top of Olivia or something so it's just
a little bit too straight nude for my
particular liking but that is also it on
my lips so you can see it there the
other shade I picked up was pink really
hard so this one is in pink really hard
I wore this in my best of beauty 2016
video I was wearing it in that video and
it was funny because that was the first
time I was trying these out and I put it
on and I was like this is just too pink
like I do not wear shades quite this
pink it's like a Barbie pink I would
describe it as and now I immediately it
was like I want to put a gloss on top or
I want to put nudie patootie on top of
it and just kind of like tone down the
pink but I was like no and you know this
is the first time I'm testing it out I'm
trying to wear it all day trying to wear
through eating and see what it lasts
like so I had to wear the pink shade and
I wasn't super confident in it but it is
it's it's very very bright pink so I'm
gonna go ahead and remove nudie patooty
and then I will put on pink really hard
so you can see it on my lips okay so
this one is in pink really hard and you
can see that it's very pink it's very
bright like it reminds me of like the
Barbie pink color like when people say
Barbie pink like this is what I think of
again it's not my favorite color I don't
wear pink like this a lot I think I was
kind of hoping that maybe it would be
more more like a mauve color on the lips
but definitely a brighter pink than I am
expecting but if you like this type of
color then there you go
this one is pink really hard and then
the last one that I picked up is in
berry recognized so I haven't tried this
one yet at all here's a better idea of
what the applicator looks like so it's
really clear right here and I don't know
how I would describe this applicator I
mean it's pretty standard for like the
liquid lipsticks but there's a pretty
big like groove and it needs to apply
with I haven't found any issues with the
applicators this is a horrible swatch
but here you go listen this one is in a
berry recognized we went all over the
place with that one so I'm curious I
tried this one on my lips because I
really do like berry shades so I'm gonna
put this on my lips and I'll be right
back
okay so here is a very recognized I
really do like the color on this one
I do like berry lips a lot it's still
drying so it's pretty sticky right now
but I really like the color this one I
have the hardest time applying though it
wasn't like super streaky but it
definitely had some streakiness to it so
it was a little bit tougher to apply
which bums me out because this is my
favorite color I was a three that I
bought but I don't know we'll see how it
dries the rest of the way but this is in
very recognized so now that I've showed
you each of the swatches of what I've
got I want to talk a little bit about
what I thought and just kind of my
feedback on the lipsticks so first of
all I mean the packaging was very cute I
like the packaging I like the applicator
I didn't find any issues with the
applicator or anything like that so for
the initial application I'm like it says
how it glides on like butter I mean I
thought that was true especially the
lighter shades they were super easy to
apply the only shade like the darker
shade berry recognized that's the one
that I noticed some streakiness with but
the other two I didn't notice any sort
of streakiness patchiness anything like
that it was only at the darker shade
which makes me think probably the other
darker shades will be like that as well
that is what I found with the wet and
wild fall collection when they came out
with the liquid lipsticks I picked up
one from there and it was super streaky
I mean very recognized was not as bad as
that one was I feel like I would still
be able to wear this and the other what
in wild lipstick wasn't it just wasn't
even wearable because of how patchy and
streaky it was so it wasn't that bad but
still it's gonna happen I'm taking to
prolong to dry while they are drying
they are pretty sticky so I just kind of
try to avoid like putting my lips
together or anything like that because
it is still pretty sticky as it is
drawing but it dries out pretty fast
I'm just within a couple of minutes or
so so I thought the drawing downtime was
pretty good they are completely transfer
proof which i thought was awesome
they do dry completely mad there's no
sort of transfer or anything like that I
mean I and I just recently put on this
lipstick and it was already matte so I
say it dries down within the 5 minutes
or whatever so that is good
another positive that I have is that
they're very comfortable I'm definitely
a more comfortable liquid lipsticks a
lot of time with liquid lipsticks they
can be really drying like just to dry on
the lips where and almost like hurts
like smile or talk because you can like
feel the formula like drying and like
crackling on your lips and it's really
uncomfortable these are not
uncomfortable at all so that's a big big
plus in my book another huge plus is the
price of course only $4.99 some people
are seeing them for even cheaper a lot
of times drug stores will have discounts
or specials or buy one get one half off
type of deals so the price is definitely
a really really big Pro so some of the
cons that I've noticed like I said with
the darker color it does seem to be
pretty patchy which is a bummer because
I really do like this color but the
darker shades I have a feeling that
might go on kind of patchy another big
con of mine is that I don't feel like
they're super long-lasting I said I
applied pink really hard and then I
filmed my best of beauty 2016 video
which it did take me a while to film
that video it's a longer video I had a
lot to talk about but I had just applied
it right before I did that video and
when I finished my inner lip was almost
completely gone of the liquid lipstick
like it did not hold up through me
talking and that was just talking that
wasn't me drinking anything I didn't
have any water or juice or anything
while I was filming that video no food
anything like that I did then reapply it
and it was easy to reapply so that is
good it kind of reminds me of the NYX
liquid their lingerie lipsticks where
they wear off a little bit easier but
they are also not bad to reapply it
sometimes would look with lipsticks you
just simply cannot reapply them because
they get to like cakey on your lips and
just like build up and it's really gross
and weird but these I thought that you
could reapply so that's kind of what I
would compare it to in that respect is
those NYX lingerie lippies so once I
reapplied it looked good again and
everything was fine and then I did an
eating test with it so I ate my dinner
it was a hotdog and fries thank you so
much very very healthy as we get into
the new year so I had
and then I checked what it looked like
after dinner and it my bottom lip was
almost completely worn off of liquid
lipstick so unfortunately I don't think
that they're super long-lasting and how
like one of the claims was like six
colors not going anywhere I can't say
that I agree with that because it
definitely wore off pretty easily and
with food like there's no match with
these liquid lipsticks against food it
is going to wear off but at the same
time a positive of that is that they
were easy to reapply and it still looked
fine after you reapplied it so those are
some of my initial thoughts like I said
I've only been testing them out for a
couple of days now so I'd still wanted
to give you guys my initial findings my
initial feedback let you know what I
thought about them let you know the pros
and cons that I have found and then also
show you the three colors that I picked
up in case you might be interested in
getting any of these colors maybe it'll
help you seeing them on my hand and on
my lips so hopefully some of those
swatches helped you out okay so to wrap
this up kind of my final thoughts on the
wet and wild a liquid cat suit matte
lipsticks I'm kind of mixed because I
think there was a lot of pros but the
cons for me are kind of a bummer like I
don't feel like I would be able to
really wear these out because I don't
think that they're super long-lasting
especially if they wear so much when I'm
just speaking like not even eating or
drinking or anything like that kind of
bumped because it seems like a lot of
people were liking them and like I said
there are a lot of pros to them like the
colors are really nice there they are
pretty pigmented especially the first
two shades like this one is just like
two flesh colored for me to really say
it has good color pigmentation it just
it looks like my skin so that one is
kind of hard like these have really good
color payoff I love this color I just
wish it wasn't a streaky as it was but
they just wear off a little bit too
quick for me so they would be really
hard to wear out somewhere or wear to an
event or anything like that so that is
kind of a bummer for me I'm glad that
you can reapply them easily but I think
I would just be like super paranoid all
night about what my lipstick is looking
like like it would be hard to enjoy
myself cuz I feel like it was my
my lips cracking too much you know what
I mean $4.99 and especially if you can
get a little bit cheaper at a drugstore
that is a really really good price like
if you just want a liquid lipstick to
wear while you make your youtube videos
or your Instagram videos maybe it won't
be a bad thing but I don't think that
you could really wear these out without
constantly having to reapply so I don't
know that's kind of my initial feedback
originally the liquid cat suits really
did not work out the best for me I hope
that my pros and cons helped you and you
think about what I said and you know
maybe the pros are like your number one
must-have pros or maybe the cons don't
you know that's not a huge con in your
book so hopefully my review or my
feedback helps you guys out but
unfortunately these actually turned out
to be a miss for me which I'm super
super bummed about I was really hoping
that I would discover a gem with these
but they just they just wear off too
fast
for me to really be able to enjoy I'm
glad that I got to try them out and test
them out
I was definitely super curious about
them that's why I put them in a will I
buy it and thank you guys for all the
feedback that you gave in that video I
love being able to test out makeup and
try it out it always bums me out when
something is amiss for me but hey it
happens every makeup product is gonna be
for everybody but as Gotha is able to
test them out I hope my reviews and
swatches helped you guys out let me know
what you think down in the comments
below have you been able to try out
these look what lipstick what should you
think of them do you have some of the
same pros and cons that I found with the
liquid lipstick and again I just hope
that you found this helpful I really
love doing reviews and testing out
makeup that's what definitely something
that I want to be able to keep doing
more on my channels I love wet and wild
I've been really excited about the new
releases that they're having but
unfortunately these look what cat suits
are just not going to work out for me
but is there anything else that is new
at the drugstore or new from what and
while they're coming out with a lot of
new products like I mentioned is there
anything else that you guys would like
me to get test out review please do just
leave that in the comments down below
and I will be happy to look those over I
do read and respond to everybody's
coming so thank you so much for
continuing to watch my videos like I
said I hope that you found this one
helpful but that is going to wrap it up
for me and my review and swatches on

of the wet-and-wild liquid catsuit of
matte lipsticks please may give this
