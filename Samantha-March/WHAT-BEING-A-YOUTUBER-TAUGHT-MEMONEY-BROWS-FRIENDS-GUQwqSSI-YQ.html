today's video is going to be like 10
things that I didn't know before I start
at YouTube or 10 things being on YouTube
taught me something along those lines I
haven't decided the title for this video
yet hopefully I picked one before I put
this video live but basically I just
want to go over a few things that I
really didn't realize before I started a
YouTube channel some are funny some are
more serious but there's just been so
many moments where I'm doing something
or working on something and I'm like man
I didn't know that was gonna be a part
of it or sometimes I'll get asked a
question and my response is something
that I felt like could fit in with this
video too so I don't know we're going to
be a little bit all over the place today
I just thought it would be kind of a
funny video maybe it'll be somewhat
insightful if you are thinking about
starting YouTube and wondering about
like different parts that go into
running a channel maybe if you're a
youtuber or a vlogger as well like maybe
you'll agree with me on some of these
things too but I just got to kind of be
just like a fun funny maybe somewhat
informative video to do but so many
times that I thought I didn't know this
I didn't know about that I'm like you
know what why not make that into a video
because if it's something that keeps
like sticking out to me like whatever
let's just make a video about it so why
don't I go ahead and happen to the top
10 things that I did not know about
starting a YouTube channel the first
thing that I feel like I did not know
before starting a YouTube channel is how
expensive it is we're just like a word
of a warning if you're going to hop on
YouTube it's going to be expensive not
necessarily getting on YouTube because
uploading a video is free but it over
time it definitely does get more
expensive when I first started out with
YouTube I was filming on my phone I did
not have any lighting I still do not
have any lighting but I have upgraded
you know I bought a $400 camera with my
tax return money this last year but even
you know someday I'll probably buy
expensive lighting but even more that
goes into the equipment is the actual
products that you're talking about
when I first started out I was trying to
come up with things like around my house
and I could talk about like one of my
very first videos was like multi-use
makeup like how to use an eyeshadow as a
highlighter things like that you know I
was trying not to buy a lot in the
beginning and any tutorials I was doing
was just sound like the old makeup that
I had sitting around but as I've been on
YouTube more you know I'm trying to buy
those new releases so I can talk about
them and review them so you're trying to
buy new products not only because you
are on YouTube and you want to talk
about them but because you are so much
more invested in the hype when you get
on YouTube but because that's a really
big part of it it's researching seeing
what's coming out see when people are
into and so it's almost like you feel
that pull every time that there's a
really big release you're like oh oh I
should get it like I feel it every
single time that there's a big release
which in the beauty world today is like
every single day so there is definitely
a point in time where I was like you
know what I think I'm buying too much
stuff and I should probably hold on
that's why I've really been enjoying by
like will I buy it and anti haul videos
because I'm being able to talk about new
releases without buying all of them
because I will admit like my spending
was getting a little out of control
after the first couple of months of
being on YouTube but it's also expensive
because I do like to buy giveaway items
I post giveaways very frequently as my
way of saying thank you you know thank
you for being the subscriber thank you
for being loyal to me thank you for
watching my videos and taking the time
like I never want to not show
appreciation for that in my way of doing
it is giveaways I have always been that
way I started a blog in 2009 and I used
to have a weekly giveaway every single
week there was some sort of book or a
package of books together or something
an Amazon gift card iTunes gift card it
didn't matter
I was holding weekly giveaways on my
blog to say thank you for coming to my
blog thank you for commenting so that
has always always always been my way of
saying thank you but for giveaways I'm
mostly buying everything myself which
can get really expensive so that was one
really big thing that I didn't realize
before getting on YouTube was how much
money you could spend at trying to put
into it and I've just recently started
seeing the paychecks
come in from you too but which is so
very exciting another reason why I've
want to say thank you to you guys I
didn't know that you could make money
having under ten thousand subscribers I
know we recently just hit over that but
it was right under ten thousand
subscribers that I got my first paycheck
from YouTube and I was like seriously
like this is the craziest thing so that
money that I get from YouTube goes back
into my giveaways or buying equipment or
find the new releases so I can talk
about so thank you guys so much for that
but that was definitely one thing that I
did not know before starting this
channel thing that I did not know before
starting a YouTube channel was how many
people will get mad at you if you don't
do your eyebrows oh my goodness you guys
I didn't even know doing your eyebrows
was a thing before I got on YouTube I
didn't know people did that like I had
seen women with like real like drawn on
eyebrows and I just thought it was
because they really didn't have any
eyebrows like I didn't know you had to
fill in your eyebrows I didn't know you
had to do all these like crazy things to
them and clean them up and concealer and
highlight under the brow I did not know
that and even when I first started
YouTube and my first couple of months on
YouTube I still didn't know that's a few
months back that really like it really
started hitting me hard
I had bought in like a tinted brow gel
and like the micro brow pencil from NYX
cuz I was like I think I'm supposed to
be doing my eyebrows everybody else is
there's all these eyebrow tutorials like
I need to learn too and I slowly like
tried to learn and then like all of a
sudden the comments started coming and
once the comments started there was like
no stopping it was like a hemorrhage of
comments about my eyebrows and I was
like oh my gosh
one night I stood in my friend Shannon's
house with her and we went through the
comments and just laughed hysterically
about like the things people would say
and how upset they were that I wasn't
doing my eyebrows I wasn't doing them
correctly or the shape was weird or
duh-duh-duh like whoa words to the
warning if you don't do your eyebrows
and you're gonna hop on YouTube and try
to be a beauty vlogger you're gonna have
to learn or else you're going
to get an even thicker scan to take some
of those comments people would even
direct message me on Instagram and be
like friendly tip you might want to do
your eyebrows and I'm like okay okay um
today I haven't really done them I did
the give me brow through them through
benefit that's that's what I did today
but I did buy some of the benefit
pencils and I'm really trying guys I'm
trying but that was one thing I
definitely did not know was coming when
I started my youtube channel that I
didn't even know existed before I
started my youtube channel was baking
and not just because I'm not good in the
kitchen but I didn't even know there was
something called like the baking
technique I do it aloud on my Instagram
page if you don't follow that on
Instagram I post a lot tutorials over
there but I'm making sure that I'm
always baking my face because people
seem to be fascinated by this technique
so I got to give people what the people
want and that is baking your face which
means you're putting like a setting
powder basically all over your face like
I usually put it on my under eyes
sometimes like under here to clean up
contour but some people just just make
their whole face like their whole face
just looks like you literally threw
baking powder on them and they're like
my makeups gonna stay all day and I'm
like okay okay okay I'm gonna do that
too so I did not know that was a thing I
remember the first time seeing a video
and watching I think of his Jacqueline
Hill was the first time that I saw
someone bake their face and I just sat
there at my computer like what are you
doing
so now I know what it is I know what
baking is I know contouring is I know
highlighting is like I got it I get it I
do it I'm down with it baking was
definitely something that I had never
even heard of before I got on YouTube so
not only baking did I learn but
highlighting I didn't know highlighting
your face was a thing I didn't know
people paid lots of lots of money for
highlighters to put on the face I didn't
know trying to get that crazy like
nikkietutorials I'm blinding you
highlight I didn't know that people like
that until I started my youtube channel
like oh man and I learned
very quickly that if you don't highlight
your face people get upset with you
they're like why didn't you highlight
girl like you could be glowing right now
and I'm like oh oh shoot I forgot that I
lied again like we have special
highlight brushes out there like we have
to take our highlighting seriously these
days so I have stocked up on
highlighters I recently have filmed a
video showing my entire highlight
collection and that was like so
requested when I started doing my makeup
collection series everyone was like I
want to see your highlighters and I'm
like okay I'll give that to you so if
you don't know what highlighting is yet
it's where you take a powder and you
like you see that right there that's
some highlight today because you've got
to make it glow and you know what
sometimes you have to put it on your
nose too and above your Cupid's bow
sometimes people say it looks like you
have snot right there but that's what we
want to see in the beauty community and
then something even came out it was the
full face challenge using only
highlighters you bet you I took that
challenge I will link it down below
I put highlighter all over my entire
face because that's what we do in the
beauty community that's what we do
another thing that I didn't realize
before started my youtube channel and I
do want to throw out here guys just like
a real quick disclaimer because I didn't
mention that in the beginning I really
didn't know how to do makeup before I
started YouTube it was just like a
couple of months before starting my own
channel that I started watching Beauty
vloggers on YouTube and I thought to
myself I can do that too
I'm interested in makeup and beauty
let's turn a passion into a paycheck
that's kind of like always my motto with
life
I love reading I love books now I write
books I'm an author that's where I make
my money from I always try to turn my
passions into my paychecks the best that
I can so I just wanted to throw that out
there as well in case anybody was
wondering that but another thing that I
didn't realize before I started my
youtube channel was how we have to
balance being perfect
and being imperfect and what I mean by
that is you feel like especially with
something like Instagram where we're
showing like the highlights of our life
over there and even you know it I mean
it comes across as social media in
general we're always posting the good
things we're always putting the positive
things we're always posting the best
selfie with the best lightning with the
best lipstick we always want to show the
best sides of us on social media not
everybody
and not all the time you know you know
what I'm saying but for the majority of
what we're putting out on social media
it's look how good this is look how
happy I am look at this happy status
look at this happy family photo etc etc
and you're not really seeing the behind
the scenes so what I have found with
social media is that you know yeah you
want to put out those good products you
don't want to share a non makeup photo
every single day with Bed Head
everywhere and drool on your chin but
you also don't want to be too perfect
because then people are like no one has
that perfect of a life like you you need
to have that balance in there but what I
have also found is that you can't be
imperfect either I remember one time
posting a makeup photo and I was so
proud of this photo because my winged
liner I worked so hard on it and I
thought it looked amazing it was sharp
it was ready to cut somebody it was
black I was like this is the best wing
liner I have ever done and I took a
photo so it was kind of like this you
could really only see like these nails
right here those are about the only
nails I believe that you could see and
they weren't painted because my nail
appointment wasn't until two hours after
I was taking those photos so I didn't
have any polish on my nails my nails
were not done I was getting ready to get
my acrylics put on and I got multiple
comments about not having my nails done
and I was just like are you guys kidding
me right now like no one else is looking
at the makeup which is the focus of this
picture no one else is looking at that
winged liner you're just noticing my two
finger nails in that photo that don't
have nail polish in them like come on
man I just remember being so upset and
even things like what the brow pictures
you know you post a picture and your
highlight is completely fierce and
people are like but you didn't do your
brows so doesn't count it's like wait so
there's such a balance that you want to
show the good pictures the best pictures
the perfect pictures but you also want
to make sure you're balancing that with
the no makeup photos with the
behind-the-scene photos but at the same
time you can too much of that either
because people expect you to be perfect
they expect you to be perfect but they
also expect you to be human and
imperfect but if you show that people
call you out on that
but if you show your perfect people call
you out for as being perfect I mean man
is in a tough line to toe I am telling
you guys but it's something that I've
definitely learned since getting on
YouTube and you know Instagram and
social media is there's that fine
balance between being perfect and
imperfect it's hard to achieve and it's
very frustrating at times but you know
what I can also sit here and laugh about
it so so there you go as you guys are
probably probably and noticing my office
more and more I'm doing that thing where
I slowly creep towards my window because
it's starting to get dark outside it's
like one of these days I'm gonna spend
the money and get actual lighting so I
don't have to be in my window during
these videos on these days it's gonna
happen so another thing that I didn't
know before I started my youtube channel
was how much time that you'd need to put
into it to have a successful channel now
as I'm filming this video I'm at 11,000
subscribers that to me is not a big
channel it's not because you see people
who have 2 million 3 million 4 million
subscribers and you're like damn that's
a big channel so 11,000 to me isn't like
earth-shattering but I real unch to this
channel in May I was more of a book
channel I relaunched it in beauty in May
of 2016
now it's September and I'm at 11,000
subscribers I work really hard at my
channel and I'd like to think that it's
successful I like to think that it's a
growing channel so I just want to throw
that out there because like I mean I
don't think I'm a queen or anything like
that one thing that you definitely have
to do a lot of is you know do your
research do your planning it takes a lot
to be researching the different products
the different and releases the different
companies and just making sure that
you're educated when you do your videos
and that really does take a lot of time
I also continually watch so many YouTube
videos I really didn't watch a much TV
anyways but since getting on YouTube
that is basically all that I watch I'm
on YouTube all the time because I'm
learning from so many different vloggers
not only like makeup techniques but just
little tips and tricks along the way
about makeup but even things about
lighting about cameras there's so many
different videos on YouTube that are
useful to fellow vloggers and I watched
them I even take like YouTube has
courses that you can take like little
like informational guides and such like
you can take those online classes and I
do I'm a part of a few different groups
where we support each other as vloggers
and his beauty influencers and it takes
time to make sure I'm watching those
other girls as videos I'm commenting to
them that I'm making sure I am making my
name and my face known in this industry
to hopefully keep growing it takes a lot
of time I didn't realize before getting
on YouTube that really honestly in my
opinion I feel like if you want to be
very successful at this it really needs
to become nearly a full-time job and I
feel very lucky in my position where I
do work from home I work for myself so I
can set my own schedule and what I do a
lot is I do a lot of my book stuff and
the day I'm best at writing in the
morning it just works out the bus for me
but then I can take all night and I can
watch YouTube videos I can film a video
in the day in front of my window in
front of the daylight and then I can
edit at night and I just feel very lucky
that I'm able to do that but honestly if
you're thinking about getting on YouTube
I really feel it's like what you put in
is what you will get out I'm not saying
that you have to work on YouTube for
eight hours a day or ten hours a day or
anything like that but I just do want to
tell you guys that it is actually very
time consuming to keep up with
everything to make sure that you're
seeing educated to be doing your
research and then to be filming and
editing and then finding other people
and staying up to date with other
friends in the community as well because
really the connections in this community
are really really key like I said I
belong to a couple different blogger
groups those have been so incredibly
helpful and have given me a couple of
different opportunities that I don't
think I would have had had I not been in
these groups so making sure that you're
you have you know your friends and your
support in this community is very
important and that means watching
people's videos and you know looking at
their Instagram and supporting them in
the same way that they support you so
when you put all of that together it
really is a lot of time to be spent on
it and I truly did not realize that
before I started my channe
I thought you know oh you just record a
couple videos a week and it can't be too
hard to edit them and that's all that
you need to do but really there is a lot
more to it so this is just something
that I want to let you guys know that
really it is very time consuming and I
did not realize that before I started my
channel feel like I'm losing my lighting
so much but I want to keep going so
another thing that I learned is that my
neighbors probably all think I am crazy
I'm really hoping that I can insert a
couple clips into this one because if
you guys can see what my neighbors see
like me outside standing on chairs
trying to take product pictures on a
table or me like with my hand holding a
product in the rocks taking photos or me
taking outfit photos outside like my
neighbors have to really wonder like
what the heck is it that that girl does
what is she doing what is her problem a
house next door for us is for sale and
I'm just curious like isn't me was it
something about me I'm just wondering if
I had any part of that because I would
feel really bad if I did but there has
been a couple times that I've caught
neighbors looking at me when I'm outside
like taking photos and I'm like hi like
I wish someone would just ask me like
what is it that you do so I could tell
them because sometimes I feel really
weird about it but you know what that's
okay sometimes taking your selfies or
your product photos or your album photos
and public is hard I have filmed a
lookbook in public that was kind of
weird to do but you know what it's all
in the name of getting those good videos
and those good shots
so before I start YouTube I didn't
realize how probably crazy I was gonna
look in public but you know what it's
okay
learned how to take really good selfies
from getting on YouTube and yes I have
watched videos on how to take good
selfies I'm not even kidding you I
really have watched videos I've watched
how to edit photos on your phone I mean
I have done it all I have learned how to
look into the light instead of looking
away from the light I've learned about
angles I've learned how to hold the
phone I've learned how to pose I've
learned what to do with my hands I've
learned what cameras are the best and
the settings that are best on the camera
oh yes I've learned it all I've watched
the videos I put in my time and research
and hopefully my selfie game just keeps
going up 4 things to talk about before
my camera completely
overheats and dies and it turns
pitch-black in my office but another
thing that I didn't realize when I
started my youtube channel is how much
it would help my creativity I am someone
who I write books for a living so when I
say that like I'm missing a creative
gene people are like no you're not
because you could make up stories in
your head and put that on paper and I am
creative in that way but in like an
artistic way I have never been creative
I feel some great art like I suck at art
I still got drawing it's like a painting
I still get visualizing my husband is
currently finishing our basement and
he'll be like and that's gonna go over
there can you see it and I'm like no I
see cement and drywall I'm very confused
and really since getting on YouTube and
really trying to learn makeup and
techniques and creating because really
makeup is art and learning how to put
all that together to create something
has helped me so much I could never like
even when I first started YouTube if I
was gonna do a makeup look I was pulling
up someone's video and copying them to a
tee and now I can make up my own looks I
can take an eyeshadow palette and create
different looks with it and I was not
able to do that before I start at
YouTube and I just think it's so
exciting whenever I create something on
my own or come up with the look on my
own I'm like oh my gosh I did that I
would never have been able to do that
and seeing it helped me in that sense I
really honestly think has helped my book
career in my creativity over there I I
felt a spark when I really started to
get the confidence in that creativity I
felt a different spark when it came to
my writing and at one point I remember
staying up until like 4 o'clock in the
morning writing and writing and writing
and not only for one certain project but
for multiple I had notebook has spread
out everywhere I had highlighters
everywhere and post-it notes everywhere
because I was so inspired and I truly
think it's it's a culmination of getting
on YouTube and finding a different
confidence and finding a creativity it
has really sparked and unleashed
something in me and that has been so
exciting I really wouldn't have thought
that learning how to to makeup would
would result in seeing a creative
boost for my writing but truly it really
has and I'm so grateful for it and I
just think that it's been something that
was really exciting to see happen and
I'm really really grateful for it the
last thing that I want to talk about
something that I didn't know before I
started YouTube is how big your squad
can get really I mean I had no idea how
far friendships could take me from
getting on YouTube I started a blog in
2009 and I saw what getting on social
media can do I have been to New York in
to Canada and to Vegas with friends in
the book world I've done book signings
in these different locations I've met
friends who are also book bloggers and
stayed at their house and had them take
me to Niagara Falls and it's been
amazing to see those friendships and it
was something that I never truly thought
could happen when I first started social
media but when I got on YouTube and I
started making friends with all of you
guys it it continues to blow my mind of
the friendships that you can make on
here and even with like my girls that I
talk to every single day that are here
on YouTube - Alex from Beauty next door
my friend Valerie Park Kelly from K
Bella Beauty Liz from wildflower Liz
these are girls that I talked to on a
nearly daily basis and we're giving each
other help and advice and support and
even though we're doing the same things
we're in the same community we're not
against each other we're not competing
with each other we're friends we're
building each other up we're excited
when we have support when I hit 10,000
on Instagram my friend Val was the very
first one who snapped me of my Instagram
page with the ten case there gold means
so much to me to have other women like
that in my life
it truly means everything you know these
are our girls that maybe I will never
meet one day I truly hope that I get to
meet all of them I hope I get to meet so
many more of you guys but even if we
don't get to meet just talking to each
other on snapchat on social media
supporting one another it means so much
and I truly could not have envisioned
that before I start at YouTube I'm so
excited to see where these friendships
go I love being able to talk to so many
different people around the world
I got a snapchat last night that said hi
from Venezuela and it's like that is
crazy though that were able to talk and
make connections with people and
it just it blows my mind every single
day and I truly did not know how many
more friendships I would be opened up to
from getting on YouTube and it's another
thing that I am so grateful for every
single day if you can tell I'm about to
lose my lighting completely but those
are my 10 things that I did not know
before starting YouTube I hope you found
some of them funny I hope you found some
of them insightful I hope I found some a
little bit helpful and it was just a
video that I thought would be a lot of
fun to make and share with you my
different experiences since getting on
YouTube instance entering into the
beauty of vlogging world the beauty
industry that sort of thing but I really
hope that you guys did enjoy this video
please do leave me some comments below
let me know what you thought of it
because I actually do have a few other
ideas kind of similar to this video so
if you guys like it I could do some
other ones as well if you are a part of
this beauty community or really any sort
of vlogging community social media
whatever together please leave in the
comments below some of the things that
you didn't know before you start it onto
your journey because I would love to
hear some of your guys's feedback as
well it's just it's been a great journey

couple of months since I started doing
this but it's been a lot of fun I
enjoyed every single day I have so much
fun making these videos and watching
videos and making connections with
