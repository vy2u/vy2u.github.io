today's video is going to be all about
what is in my makeup backup drooler what
do I already have backups of in my
collection this video idea came from
Katie she left a comment on my past
videos
she said hey Sam hey girl have you ever
thought of doing a video on what you
have a backup on I know I have a small
backup box but I'd be interested to know
if any influencers have backup boxes or
drawers and I said yep I will do that
video cuz that sounds like a lot of fun
so I went through my backup drawer I do
have one the desk behind me the top
drawer on this side that's where I put
if I buy an extra product but I'm not
out of it yet I'll put it in there like
sometimes I'll put in like certain
foundations that maybe they're not my
shade right now I'll put them in there
for safekeeping and all of that so I
went through my backup drawer this
shouldn't be too long of a video knowing
me I could probably make it long but I
just have a few items in here some
makeup and then also some skin care to
touch on but if you want to see what is
in my makeup backup drawer won't we go
ahead and get started
okay so first up I have two mascaras
here this one is one of my newer
mascaras to me but I really like this
mascara this is the Maybelline at total
temptation mascara I put it in the
favorite section of my makeup monthly
maybe two months ago I consistently
wearing it with days I'm not wearing
false lashes you see this one link in my
description box quite a bit it's just
one of my favorite mascaras right now so
I've already gotten it maybelline does a
lot of like buy one get one half off buy
one get one free types of things
especially at Ulta so that is why I have
a backup already of this one and then
this is another one of my favorite
drugstore mascaras this is from flower
beauty this is the zoom in mascara I
really like this mascara as well if said
really good things about it I've
purchased myself a backup I actually
purchased another one for a giveaway
that is coming up and very excited about
this mascara will be in there but I
really like it it has the three-in-one
so you can actually twist the wand and
the one will perform different things
you have length volume and then curls so
yeah these are two of my favorite
drugstore mascaras so I already have
backups of them I do have some skincare
that was in my
drawer that's not down here but actually
in my bathroom I have a little section
of items that I have multiples of I
didn't want to do things like sheet
masks there are things like that because
obviously like I have a ton of sheet
masks so I wanted to focus on the items
that I really love and have gone out and
repurchase and I also wanted to focus on
items that I've bought myself versus
receiving in PR or something like that
because I think that gives a better idea
of what I actually really love and would
go out and buy and like need a back
above so that's kind of what this video
is focused on as well but this here is
from a terminological I just got this
the other day this is the pre cleanse
this is one of my favorite ways to
remove makeup it just comes in a little
bottle with a pump on it and it's just a
cleansing oil and to me it's like the
quickest and easiest way to take off all
of my makeup it takes off everything my
liner my lash adhesive my glitter liquid
lipstick it takes everything off is my
favorite cleansing oil at the moment to
use it's just my number one and I am
almost out of having to really pump
pretty hard on the one that I have so I
have a backup here and then also this
one is from Olay this is the Olay eyes
deep hydrating eye gel I got this sent
to me in PR ended up falling in love
with it purchased it myself and then
Olay actually sent me another one as
well so I have another backup of this
one but I'm not mad because my one that
I have now by original one I'm really
like scraping at the bottom of that gel
to get it off but this is my go-to eye
gel in the morning it's really cooling
it's nice pretty puffing the eyes and
that's something that I deal with most
in the morning because I don't sleep the
best and I wake up a lot in the middle
of the night and such so I typically
have pretty puffy eyes in the morning so
I like something that has more of a
cooling effect to it and this one
definitely does and it's good for
hydration as well so the Olay deep
hydrating eye gel is when I have a
backup as well an eye liner that I have
a backup of this is from a DHC and this
is their liquid eyeliner I get these on
Amazon I was talking about this and my
over looked at makeup products video
that this is just my favorite liquid
liner it's my go-to it's $20 so it's
kind of expensive for a liquid liner but
sometimes you can get certain deals on
Amazon or you get like deals on shipping
or things like that so that's where I
get my liners from a DHD but
already have a backup in my drawer so
gotta have it I mean otherwise like I'm
just I'm not the best at doing wings and
I don't do them a ton so than what I do
do them again it's like oh man not so
well and I just feel like the DHD is the
easiest one for me to use so down a
backup of that and then also this one is
from NYX this is a soft matte lip cream
in London I think this is my third
repurchase of this one I do have an open
one already and this one still has the
packaging on it and then I also have
another backup of this because it came
in a PR package that I got from NYX so I
have even more London's but like I can't
like I can't get rid of if I keep them
all this is one of my favourite nudes I
love London I've repurchased it so many
times I should probably just toss the
one that I have open because it's like
you're really gonna be digging in there
and digging that one down there to get
any out but I use it to like the very
last drop but yeah I already have a
couple backups in here but this one NYX
London one of my favorites had to have a
backup of it this is my favourite lash
and he said I have to have a backup of
this I can't run out of this it would
just be too devastating it would just be
too devastating but this is from duo
it's their strip lash adhesive this is
in the clear up here okay
I'll flip it around for ya cuz the white
sash clear so when you put it on your
lash it does come out white but it does
strike clear I do have it this is what I
used on my lashes today when I don't do
a winged liner I typically go for the
clear because I feel like the dark tone
if it does dry down at all it kind of
blends in easier with the liner or I can
go over it with the liner to cover the
lash but this is absolutely clear so I
have to have this I can't when I start
getting down there on my little tube I
have to go out and repurchase this you
can find this at Sephora ultimate
drugstores that's like six dollars I
always have to have a backup of it
I have some lashes but I have a Becca
back well who saw that coming
none of you I'm sure and the styles are
in bombshell diva and bombshell these
are from pur cosmetics these are just my
favorite lashes I talk about them a lot
but they're my favourite lashes these
were the three pairs that I didn't have
opened yet like these aren't cut or
anything they're still all nice and new
in their package but between bombshell
and deep
I probably have two or three opened ones
in my last drawer and then these are the
ones that I haven't got around to like
cutting and stuff yet but yeah favorite
lashes obviously I have backups of them
so this guy is kind of random and I
don't I'm trying to think of what my
thought process was putting this in my
backup drawer and I'm excited to do this
video because would I open up my back
after I was like oh oh I didn't know
some of these items we're in here I
haven't opened it in a while I guess but
this is from Sigma Beauty it's a 3d HD
max kabuki like why did I put it in a
backup jar it's not like a makeup brush
is like a lipstick you're like oh when I
run out then I'll open a new lipstick or
a mascara I'm gonna wait till one runs
out and then I'll open the other one
it's a brush I can use it any time and I
only have one of the 3d HD max kabuki
and I feel like I wash it a ton I just
mentioned it in my makeup one place that
videos gone up I put it in the favorite
section even though it's not a new brush
to me I just have been consistently
using it I use it today for my makeup
look and I feel like I'm washing it all
the time I've had a backup brush sitting
in my backup drawer all this time I'm
like Samantha get it together girl what
is wrong with you you could man you know
cuz I have multiples of some of my
favorite brushes like the Sigma e-40
blending brush I think I have five the
Sigma e25 might also have five of them
because then you don't have to wash them
as much so look it's still in the
package it's like wow so I'm really glad
I did this video because I found my
extra 3d HD max kabuki brush a low
girlfriend and then another enema here
from Sigma this is the Sigma Jake the
brush a shampoo this is the liquid one
obviously I mean I feel like a lot of
the backups I have our Sesa T's to me if
you will like eyelash glue it's a
necessity for your girl look I can't run
like what would I do if I run out of my
eyelash glue that'd be embarrassing but
like this one like I have to have a
brush cleaner you can't run out of a
brush cleaner I like that would be
devastating and the cig magic the brush
shampoo that they have is just one of my
favorites I feel like it's really easy
to clean it with and everything it still
has the seal on ooh there we go well but
this is what it looks like you just pump
it out and it's super easy to clean so
my other one is getting pretty mad I
could probably throw that one away since
I have a new bottle here already but
I've gone through
couple of these and it's just one of my
favorite brush cleaners so I already
have a backup of that and then this guy
here this is kind of random too but
again it's a fur brush cleaning this is
the blender cleanser solid this is in
chill swirl this is just like a little
add-on that I picked up at Sephora I
actually really like these little guys
for cleaning my makeup sponges the most
I just kind of keep this on my Sigma
glove in the bathroom because I am
pretty good at cleaning my sponges I'm
not like I'm not super quick on cleaning
my brushes all of the time but my beauty
sponges I won't use them dirty I will
always clean them I mean I have a lot of
sponges but I will always clean them
every time and these are just kind of my
favorite way to clean them so my white
one that I have is mmm it's getting
pretty much down there so the last time
I made a purchase from Sephora I put
this in here as well so I wouldn't run
out of it so that's how I prefer to
clean my Beauty sponges and then
speaking of Beauty sponges the last item
that I have to talk about is from
L'Oreal this is their blend artist
infallible foundation blenders the
L'Oreal Beauty sponge I picked this up
from Alton because L'Oreal was having
like a buy one get one half off or
something like that as well and I put
one of these and one of my last
giveaways that I did and then 'hi get
one for myself because that's just
that's just how I do things okay but
this is definitely one of my favorite
sponges it's nice and affordable as well
especially when you get it at some sort
of discount my one I still do have it
I'm looking at it she's in ok shape but
mmm she's gonna have to go pretty soon
and like I said it's just one of my
favorites that I reach for a ton so I
have a backup here already but again
another one that like as I'm looking at
the L'Oreal sponge and it's in its
little area I'm like why am I still
keeping this in the bottle I Q can open
it you can use multiple sponges at one
time Samantha what is your problem I
don't know if I'm just like waiting
until that one does kick the bucket so I
can maybe like keep them apart and I
don't accidentally throw away the newer
one when I should have thrown over
though no I don't know what my has
anyone else done that I don't I truly
did not realize that I've done that with
my live brush and a sponge until doing
this video and now I'm a little bit
embarrassed but that's ok because that's
just this what it is but I do have a
backup of the L'Oreal infallible sponge
because it's one of my favorites
ok so this going to be everything
for today's video and what it's into my
makeup backup jar I felt like I kept
that pretty short and sweet I didn't
feel like there was a ton of like
specific backups that I have in there
like you know there's different like
formulas and things like that that I
have around the house but like exact
same items that's what I wanted to focus
this on and of course like items I
bought for myself too I wanted to focus
in on that and really not not too bad I
think for my makeup backup drawer but
I'd love to know what you have as a
backup if you are a content creator I'd
love to see you doing this video as well
thank you - Cadia for the idea because I
thought that was a really fun idea and I
had a lot of fun going through my makeup
backup dry sure to leave your backups in
the comments section so I can read what
you have as well but other than that if
you guys did enjoy this video I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
at tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
