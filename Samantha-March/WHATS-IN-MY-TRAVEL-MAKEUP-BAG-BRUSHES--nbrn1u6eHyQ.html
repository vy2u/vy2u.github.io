today's video is going to be all about
what is in my travel makeup bags and as
I said two of them so I recently was at
a Thomas beginner if you can tell I
still have a pretty recipe boys I losted
from not getting enough sleep playing in
mud all weekend and karaoke so you know
there's that but I've been getting a lot
of requests to do what is in my travel
makeup bag and I saw it this is kind of
the perfect time to show you what's
actually in my makeup bag so I just got
home yesterday before I unpacked my
makeup bags I thought I could show you
what's in it I'm also going to show you
what brushes I bring along with me so I
have all my brushes in this case so it's
going to go through my two makeup bags
and then my brushes and just show you
what it is that I take with me when I
travel out of town stand I'm really
excited to finally be filming this one
cuz it's been requested for awhile so
right now I am still posting every
single day so if you like getting a
daily content on makeup and beauty I
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button I also do a live chat
every single Tuesday at 4 p.m. CST if
you ever want to come by and live chat
with me but if you would like to see
what I take with me in my travel makeup
bag why don't we go ahead and get
started
I will say that when I pack my makeup to
go out of town it's like very organized
and I have like specific things in this
bag and specific things in the other bag
and everything fits nicely and then when
you actually go out of town you come
back like everything is just a disaster
so I really don't know what the
organization looks like in these guys
but it's probably not going to be very
cheap don't judge me because this is
what I get when you're just hurriedly
like packing up to get ready to go home
so this is the first bag I have this is
a bag bag I actually got when I placed
an order through Ulta it was like a free
gift with purchase from benefits that
purchased some of their bra products so
just has benefit San Francisco and it
says hello gorgeous and that zipped and
I like it because I feel like it's a
fairly deep bag I don't know if I can
show you with everything dropping out
but it's a fairly deep bag so it does
fit a lot of stuff so I take this one
with me quite a bit first couple things
I see in here this is the primer that I
brought the number 7 airbrush away
primer one of my favorite primer is it's
not like super super large it's not like
travel-size or whatnot but it's nice not
super large and easy to travel with one
of my fav
at primers I also brought the car to
rainforest of the sea foundation echoes
this should come as no surprise excuses
all of the time it's just a very super
long wearing foundation so what I'm
going to go out of town and I'm not sure
like how often I can do touch-ups and
things like that I need a long wear
foundation so I brought the Tarte one
with these is my Clarins face trio so
inside there is a setting powder a
contour bronzer shade and then also a
blush shade it up as a mirror I think is
traveling with me so often this is one
of my favorite face palettes to travel
with it's sleek it's compact easy to
travel with it has a mirror I love it
because it has the three different
shades so it's a multi-use palette which
is super easy so instead of I mean I
still pack other contour shades I mean I
still tackle their bronzers and blushes
but I have everything in here and I
don't feel like I need to grab as many
because I have this guy so yeah this
comes with me so often or I put in here
but I didn't actually use this one this
is the Beca first light priming filter
it's just a little sample guy I use this
in my full face using samples video and
I really liked it and then I actually
found this deluxe sample I think a
subscriber actually sent this to me when
they send me a box with like a letter
and in a couple different makeup things
that have this guy in it and I was like
man it's really just like that so I put
that one in there concealer I brought
with me is the maybelline instant age
rewind I love this concealer because it
is so good for dark circles when I get
asked like what you use to cover dark
circles
it's the instant age rewind it is so
good so when I'm going down to town and
knowing that I'm probably not gonna be
getting a lot of sleep I bring this guy
because it's so helpful a couple
different face items here let's see I
brought this highlight this is from Jake
at beauty it is there a Bella Rose baked
highlighter the purple iridescent shift
to it and it is so so beautiful I did
wear this the one day and I think I am
shared a snapchat of the pore room ah
staying in that just had like makeup
everywhere and this is in there and a
lot of people are asking what it was I
use this and my get ready with me using
unhide to make up I can leave a link
down below in case you want to see it in
action but it is so so pretty and
another highlight I brought is from
essence this is their pure nude
highlight again I bring this one
traveling with me very often too because
it's
like a federal highlight but with a bit
of a boost like it's not metallic or
glittery but it's not super natural at
the same time it's like a really good
mix I love this highlight again a
subscriber sent this to me and I'm like
oh thank you because it's like one of my
favorite lies I think it's so pretty so
if you want a good drugstore highlight
check out essence more face items here I
brought this blush from Tarte it's the
parte blush and it's a little sample
size of it so it's easy to travel with
and I also brought along my number 7
bronzer
looks like this it's the bronzer in
caramel it's the shade it has a nice
mirror - this is one of my favorite
bronzers I use it all of the time I like
that has the mirror as well so I've got
one and then one more blush that I
brought because why not
this is also from essence it's these
silky touch blush I like it you know a
little smaller as well so easier to
travel with with a super super pigmented
blush I think it's really nice so
essence makeup has definitely been
impressing me lately as well moving on I
have some eyeliners here it looks like I
brought three different eyeliners maybe
even more
but here's Tori oh I see so I brought
the Marc Jacobs highlighter in Odyssey
which is a really gorgeous teal blue
love it I brought my Pierre OnPoint
liner this is in brown this is awesome
for the waterline just so good for the
waterline if you want more of like a
basic color in there and then I also
brought my DHC a liquid eyeliner again
this is one of my favorite liquid liners
to create winged liner with I absolutely
love it for mascara I brought along the
Catrice a rocket or mascara this mascara
is the frickin bomb no joke utter proof
it's super long wearing this is the one
I'm fairly confident I wore in my sweat
proof makeup video and it lasted all
days throughout volleyball so this is
what I wore all weekend and it just
impresses me so much I also brought
along a little travel eyeliner because
why not this is the lorac eyeliner it's
in black so I brought a blue a brown and
a black for the waterline and then a
black liquid liner totally different you
know I have a couple of lash tools in
here I brought my duo adhesive in the
dark gray
it's called Darktown adhesive for my
lashes and then I also brought my Tarte
lash applicator tool but I always have
to have when I'm putting lashes on a
couple brow items in here that I have
this is from
Survive cosmetics it's their infinity
waterproof it's called their eyebrow
liner in the shade Audrey I am obsessed
with this brow pencil 100 completely
totally obsessed with this brow pencil
absolutely love it I couldn't fathom
leaving town without it and I also
brought the benefit Ready Set brow which
is there clear brow gel to be able to
set my brows and then the last couple
items in here
I also brought along with the it
cosmetics CC cream I really really liked
the CC cream I have a little bit left in
here and I also had two more like sample
packet sizes that I brought and I
actually used one the one day I just
really like those really nice coverage
for a CC cream and it lasts all day on
me so I like that one
I also brought the Anastasia Beverly
Hills sticks foundation I'm in the shade
natural this is if I wanted a lighter
coverage than the Tarte foundation and
then I brought along this is the elf
liquid foundation I'm not sure the
actual name of it because nothing
labelled on the bottom but I'll find it
and leave everything link down below in
the order that I'm saying them but it's
just a liquid foundation it reminds me a
little bit of the Marc Jacobs dewdrops
just not quite the same intensity of
course as the market goes to drop but it
kind of reminds me of them it's a really
nice liquid highlight really do like
this one everything in my first little
benefit bag and then moving on I also
have this bag this is from Victoria's
Secret and I got this like I mean so
long ago I think it was like a free gift
with purchase but again it's really nice
bag houses if we're on it and it is
quite large I mean I feel like I can fit
a lot of stuff in here too so I take
this with me like almost all of the time
so I will run through what I have in
this guy as well this one I have my
eyelashes and because this is who I am
I brought three different pairs of
eyelashes you know just engaged they're
all from here because these are my
favorite lashes right now I can't like
not wear them I love them
I brought these Styles in diva also
bombshell and then flirt just in case so
yeah three different pairs of lashes
came with me
I can tell the fishes who I am I also
brought a face powder with me I brought
the Maybelline a better skin at skin
transforming powder I like this one to
travel with too because it's pretty big
it has a large mirror here I really
liked the face powder it has its own
little sponge that I end up using more
than I thought I would when I first
bought this product but I do like the
sponge but the big mirror helps a lot to
just unlike doing makeup in general and
then let's see I have a couple of my
pallets in here so I brought four
different eyeshadow palettes I brought
my Tarte and style by Haru SH palette I
bring those palettes basically every
time I travel I just can't help it one
of my favorite palette to travel with
small compact it has six different
eyeshadows a little blush a big mirror
it's so easy to travel with
I love these matte brown shades it also
has some nice shimmers and it has a
steeper color in case I feel like going
crazy so really like the blush and I
just take this with me almost every
single time another one I always travel
with is the ancestor Beverly Hills
mother of renaissance I always bring
this palette with me I can't help it I
love this palette so much it has the
mirror as well but again just one of my
favorite palettes one that I always
travel with other color that I've been
finding myself grabbing for a lot when
at traveling is one of the pur cosmetics
vanity palettes and this one is in
dreamchaser I love these palettes I have
both of them but this is the one I
normally travel with because it has the
matte Brown eyeshadows which of course I
always gravitate towards so it has the
eyeshadows it also has a bronzer it has
a blush as a highlight it has a nice
mirror here but also what's interesting
about the mirror is that you can pop it
up and basically create your own little
vanity which is super helpful with
traveling I take this video with me
almost every single time that I'm going
from wearing the matte shadow so I
actually love the bronzer shades blush
highlight and the highlight in here is
so freaking nice it's really beautiful
but then the mirror and school vanity
concept like I love this and the other
palette this is a newer palette to me
but it actually is what I ended up
wearing on Saturday I think it was this
is from Joseph colors it's the marvelous
moths eyeshadow palette so you have the
five different mob shades in there has
its own little brush which I actually do
use so that's why the brush is still in
here but I love this it's just a bunch
of matte cool toned
of shadows and I think it's absolutely
gorgeous I reached for it right away on
Saturday and created a mop I look and
it's really nice to travel with again
very like sleek compact has the nice
mirror very sturdy packaging too which
is always something I think about as
well when I'm grabbing items to travel
with they don't want anything to break
on me and yeah I really love to pellet I
did bring a makeup sponge with me this
is the Eco tools sponge I really love
that too little guy
another brow pencil that I brought with
me is the benefit precisely my brow I'm
in shade number three so it also brought
him of course eyebrows guitar shaped
tape obviously I roll the star shaped a
holy how could I not bring the torch a
tape even though I love the Maybelline
instant age rewind I also am clearly
obsessed with the shape tape and I think
it's really great full coverage support
I had to bring that as a brought my ELF
eyelid primer I've raved about this
eyelid primer in the past so of course I
had to bring him and then we move on to
the lipsticks I did share a photo on my
snapchat as I was packing them I was
like yep those are all news so way to go
Samantha I did bring two different lip
liners with me one is from Mac in boldly
bare and the other one is from NYX and
this one is in nude beige ugly vs nude
beige so a couple of like regular
lipsticks that I brought along with me
this one is from Tarte it's in the shade
colada which is a peachy nude just one
of my favorite along where regular
lipsticks I just you know what mood
you're going to be in with your lip
safety mount liquid lipstick a gloss a
regular lipstick retinol so I had to
bring all of my favorites and then I
also brought with me the Mac velvet
teddy I really enjoy this nude as well
 watch all of these news so you can
see what they look like so you can see
how ridiculous I am I'll go ahead and do
it just for the fun of it why not so we
can see my lipstick selection that I
brought with me so they're our first we
have colada and then we have velvet
teddy from Mac and then the other
regular lipstick that I brought with me
is a new one that I just tried out I
think it was in my sample challenge is a
little guy from Burberry and it's in the
shade nude so that's what that one looks
like I'll go ahead
watch so that one is new from Burberry I
want to turn that one along because I
just traded in that sample challenge and
I thought it was really pretty so I
wanted to bring it with me and the
liquid lipsticks that I decided to bring
I brought three of them so one is from
Mac it's in burnt spice it was what I
was wearing
the day that we left actually I love
this I talked about it on my snapchat
and I said it was one of like my new
favorite go to news Plus Mac burnt spice
and I also brought a lipstick from huda
beauty these are one of my favorite
liquid lipsticks so of course I had to
travel with this this one that I brought
is in the shade girlfriend I just love
the shade girlfriend I have some smaller
sizes from the hooda lipsticks that I
thought to bring but I'm just obsessed
with girlfriend at the moment kind of
like a apricot both nude so beautiful
and then I brought along one from ultra
in Manila I love this nude as well
actually I made a mistake I was wearing
Manila when I left that day I wasn't
burnt spies in another video so is
wearing Manila the day that we left on
our trip so of course I had to bring
that with me but again I just want to
bring it anyways because I think it's so
freaking gorgeous so those are all the
lipsticks that I brought with me because
I love news and then of course I brought
along my little Marc Jacobs sugar sugar
lip gloss it's a pretty sheer lip gloss
so I'm not going to swatch exceed really
be able to see anything but it's just a
beautiful gloss and when I'm wearing
like a liquid lipstick if it starts to
like fade at any time throughout the
night I just put a little bit of sugar
sugar over and it kind of like gives my
lips a boost again so I always always
travel with my sugar sugar I know it's
expensive I also do up a full-size of it
too I know it's expensive but seriously
I always take it with me so these were
all of the lipsticks that I brought with
me
I literally brought foaming nudes I'm so
ridiculous okay so after my lipsticks I
thought I would also share what brushes
I brought along with me this case is
from morphe brushes it came with like
the copper dreams brush set and a bunch
of brushes came in em too actually they
could have sent to me from my subscriber
friend Jordan which is so amazing and
I'm so appreciative of it because I love
so many of those brushes but the case is
also super super handy so you can see
all of my brushes in here super super
need to bring with me and I don't have
to worry about any of them like getting
damaged or whatnot so these are all of
the brushes so I'll just run through
them quickly here as you can see what I
brought the first two brushes that I had
to bring because I'm obsessed with them
they're new they're from Sigma beauties
they're their dimensional brushes the 3d
HD max kabuki and then also the curved
kabuki I just love both of these I'm
obsessed with them this is what I use
for foundation and bronzer this one is
what I use for concealer I think they're
awesome they have these really unique
shapes and curves to fit like any part
of your face I just didn't want to not
travel with them because they're my
current obsession and then another face
brushes that I brought this is the Ã¬iÃ®
from morphe I'll use this to dust powder
all over my face I'll use it to sweep
away and baking powder and I'll also use
it just to blend everything together so
this one has a lot of different
functions and I always want to bring my
III or face brushes that I brought this
one is the bronzer brush that I chose
it's also from morphe stem at five-30
it's pretty small you can use it for
like contour or bronzing I typically use
it for my bronzer brush and then for my
blush brush
I bought the Sigma large angled contour
the s40 I'm obsessed with this for blush
at the moment a nice angled brush so
that's what I use for blush and then
this is my Sephora 57 brush I've talked
about this recently in my products that
I think you need in your Sephora cart
this is what I use for concealer under
my eyes or even on my eyelids I
literally use this brush every single
day every day this is the brush I love
it
it's one of my absolute favorites of
course as come traveling with me it's
just like a no-brainer the highlight
brushes that I brought with me is from
Sigma it's the SL 3 I absolutely love
this highlight brush one of my absolute
favorites it's amazing I had to go with
me as well this one is my Sigma baek
precision at p 89 so you can see like
the little angle to it this is what I
use to put setting powder under my eyes
if I'm not baking like I'll just put a
little bit of a setting powder right on
there and you can tap it into your eyes
you can also use it for your eyelids or
you can also use it for a nose contour
because it has a really nice just like
unique shape to it so I can use
for a few different options so that's
why I like to bring that and then I
think everything else is going to be my
eye brushes because you just never know
what I like you're going to create so
you just got real water brushes right
two brushes are both eye brushes from
the morphe copper dream set which i
think is filled out right now which is a
huge bummer but if it comes back I say
that you get it because they're blending
brushes in here absolutely phenomenal I
love them these two are definitely my
favorite blending brushes I just always
have to take them with me I have my
efore tea from Sigma which is a blending
brush one of my absolute favorites also
be e35 from Sigma another blending brush
and again another one of my absolute
favorites had to bring those those oh
this is another brush from a theme or
feline this is more of a like precise
but still blending brush at the same
time love it pretty sure I brought two
of my Sigma e25 because that like hands
down yep two Sigma e25 brushes because I
love the 25 when I say that Sigma has
like some of my favorite brushes I'm not
kidding and hopefully you can actually
see in this video this is what I travel
with and what I choose I am a Sigma
affiliate if you ever want any Sigma
brushes you can use my code Samantha for
10% off and I'm not kidding I love them
all face
I also brought these Sigma e45 this is
more of a pointed brush which I'm doing
any crease work this is the liner that
I'm grabbing my flat shader that I
brought with me is the e 54 I use this
almost every single day as well I love
it also from Sigma and then a couple of
my more like precise brushes this is one
from ELF it's just a small pencil brush
another pencil brush that I bought from
Sigma is their pencil brush e30 I use
this for like lower lash line work and
then I also brought along my morphe 18
and this is my favorite brush to use for
highlighting the brow bone and also the
inner corner so I always trouble with
those so after that that is all brushes
that came with me I don't it seems a
little crazy but hey I love these
brushes hi guys after that that's going
to be everything that I took with me in
my travel makeup bag when I was gone
this begin I think that I am going

husband and some friends so if you want
