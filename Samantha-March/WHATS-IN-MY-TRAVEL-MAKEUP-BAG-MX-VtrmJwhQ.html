going to be a like what's in my travel
makeup bag I'm going to go over the like
absolute must-haves that I have in my
makeup bag when I am traveling i'm also
going to share my makeup brushes i was
going to do other things like makeup
remover and skin care and hair and
things like that but i think i'm just
going to keep it to the makeup products
and the brushes or else i feel like this
video could be like an hour long so that
is what today's video is going to be and
if you would like to see what i have to
have with me when i travel to keep
acting like to bring to eyeshadow
palette slippy and these are just my
favorite ones that i keep bringing over
and over but the first is a Kat Von D
shade and light palette I did a full
video and makeup tutorial on this
palette but I absolutely love it it's
all mat bringing this one with me now
but I also like to bring my Z palette
that has my shades from makeup geek
cosmetics love makeup geek cosmetics I
think so many of their shadows are
gorgeous I really do want to get more
but these are the ones that I have right
now and so many of them are great peach
smoothie is one that I use as a
transition color literally almost every
single day creme brulee is next to it
it's another one that I use absolutely
all the time this one on the end is
called glamorous and that's really great
for if I just want to do something basic
I will literally just do creme brulee in
my crease and then I will do glamorous
all over the lid and it's beautiful
cocoa bear is this brown shade in the
middle it's great everyone needs cocoa
bear and their life as long as well as
shimma shimma this shimmery color down
here cocoa bear shimma shimma and Peach
Smoothie there like in a diagonal line
over here I just feel like you need
these in your collection cocoa bear is
such a pretty deep rich brown so
beautiful when blending out your colors
shimma shimma is absolutely gorgeous on
the lid you can also use it as like an
eyebrow highlight and it's stunning
these two shades over here the first one
this reddish one is bitten it is a
gorgeous reddish brown color it is such
a unique color I think it's beautiful on
the
lid I think it's beautiful blended out
with cocoa bear those two together are
like the perfect match ever this one
down here is envy I don't use this as
much unless I'm doing a more dramatic I
but it's a beautiful green shade and i
love it i don't use it as much envy is
probably the ones that I use the least
out of this palette but makeup geek
cosmetics all my shadows on here I love
it you can also get this Z palette
because the makeup geek shadows they
just pop right in there magnetic wise
and you can get the Z palette on amazon
but you can also get it right on makeup
geek that's what i did when i ordered my
shadows i just did the Z palette with it
so these two shadows I just I always
bring these when I travel these are the
two that going this is what my makeup
bag looks like it's just victoria secret
black and whites pretty big i can't zip
it now cuz i put like some random things
in here like perfume and deodorant that
normally wouldn't go in my actual makeup
bag when i travel but threw them in here
so i could forget all downstairs to show
you so opening it up right on top I just
threw in that of course i have to have
do turrent and I grabbed my perfume this
is Khloe and I love the cute little bow
on it and it just smells like it just
smells good honestly it kind of smells
like fall to me now it has kind of like
maybe a musky your scent I don't know
how to describe her firm yet clearly the
bottle is so cute and I really really
love my Gucci intense i've mentioned it
in a favorites video like i really love
it but i always get so paranoid then i'm
going to like break it or forget it
somewhere so I usually bring like my
second favorite with me when I travel
anyone else do that ok so then to the
actual makeup well let's see here I just
throw everything in so I'll just kind of
grabbed out see if I can try to group
things together as best as I can but one
thing that I always make sure to bring
is primer of course this is the
Maybelline master prime by face studio
it is the blur and illuminate primer
this is really good because sometimes I
will just wear this on its own and I
won't put foundation under it but
otherwise
I'm wearing foundation I will put this
underneath the other one that I always
travel with is my illuminating tinted
moisturizer this is kind of similar to
the primer but this gives me a little
bit more oomph if I don't want to wear
foundation and but I just want something
on my face this is from stila and I
really like it if I don't want to wear
foundation but still want to wear more
than just like powder or primer I will
wear this and I did grab two foundations
so these are the foundations that go
with me when I travel I grabbed the
maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
shade 230 natural buff I also bring with
me the maybelline superstay better skin
skin transforming foundation with SPF 15
in shade 25 nude beige I just did a full
review video on this foundation i will
link it below and it'll be somewhere up
here as well if you want to see my full
review on this but I bring those two
foundations as well and then you might
laugh but I bring three concealers and
I'll kind of tell you why so the first
one I bring is the Maybelline instant
age rewind and this I just absolutely
love like if we have an early morning
this is what the top looks like it's
kind of like fluffy if we have an early
morning and I just feel like I have a
ton of dark circles I just placed this
right underneath my dark circles on my
eye and then i use my um this is the
Maybelline fit me in shade 10 stare fit
me concealer and then I actually used
this for the highlighting of my face so
I use this to cover dark circles and I
use this to conceal and highlight then I
also do have this is the l'oreal true
match it's their super blendable cran
concealer so that's what it looks like
and it just has it twists up and twist
down this I mostly use to cover any
blemishes like if I'm only using powder
or primer and i'm not using full
foundation that will cover my blemishes
i use this to color correct those so
that is why I bring along three
concealer then for powder I bring the
maybelline fit me this is in 310
beige and it's from the matte and
poreless line as well that's what that
one looks like so this one I usually do
if I'm just doing primer I'll just put
some powder over it I don't use powder
when I use the tinted moisturizer or
sometimes even if i don't use primer
i'll just put some of this on my face it
kind of even out the skin tone it's one
of my favorite powders I do kind of feel
like I have to use a lot of it in order
to show up so i think the shade might be
a little bit too late for me but
otherwise i really like the coverage
that it gives other powder that I bring
is the Rimmel stay matte and it's the
translucent powder to set my concealer
like honor my ayah or any places that i
conceal our highlight I put this on I I
mean I will not leave without my
translucent powder hey to keep moving on
this I actually recently bought and I
haven't even talked about it on camera
yet but I now know that it will go
everywhere with me and it is the
Maybelline brow drama and I have it in
blonde and like I said I just bought it
the wand is kind of different sorry I
have a bunch of stuff in my hands but I
have this on my eyebrows it doesn't to
me it didn't make like a huge difference
but it makes a subtle difference and
that's kind of what I'm going for as I
start to get into the eyebrow game I
don't have any sort of like anything
when it comes to eyebrows and I honestly
have pretty full and thick eyebrows as
it is so I don't feel like I need a
whole lot but i thought i would get
something as i'm testing it out and
being on YouTube more so i picked up the
Maybelline brow drama just at target i
think it was like six dollars maybe and
so far i'm really liking it so i know i
will bring it with me when I do travel
few other eye pencils i bring i bring
along this NYX jumbo eye pencil in 60
for milk so it's just a really good
white base to have if i'm doing like a
lot of times when I'm traveling I just
do like casual looks but this is really
good it's almost you know can be a place
of a primer usually if i'm going to use
this crayon I don't use an eye primer
also I do want to say well okay so I
feel like I'm going insane but the last
concealer that I used that I'm literally
putting everything
front of me it's gone it's not there
it's not in my bag it's not on the floor
I have no idea where this concealer went
to but it was the l'oreal crayon
concealer i will also sometimes use that
as an eye primer instead of using like
an actual expensive eye primer that I
have like I have the two-faced primers I
typically don't bring those on vacation
with me just because normally i'm not
doing like crazy full face of makeup and
I feel like those concealers work for
primers just fine and I keep the primers
for more like special occasions since
they're more expensive so it's kind of
like a tune one that I'm using that for
but yeah if I'm going to use this if I
know I'm going to use it with a look
usually I'll use it if I know I'm going
to do like I want a really bright inner
corner I will use this because I feel
like it just enhances it but it also can
be used as a primer yes i am talking
really fast because i feel like i'm like
like i don't know why oh so excited i
have no idea what's going on kind of
weird and then i have to eyeliners that
I always bring with me this is the
knicks trays you lay eyeliner and it is
in just regular old black that's what it
looks like this is one of my favorite
eye liners for my waterline because i
feel like it does have better lasting
power than others that i've tested out
and then for the my top eyeliner this is
like my absolute favorite i mentioned it
in a favorites video it's the maybelline
new york master graphic by I studio it's
there it's just again a regular old
black eyeliner that's what the tip looks
like because it's pretty different it's
my absolute favorite I think it's so
easy to use it's easy to wing out I just
I won't leave without this either blush
that I always bring with me is because
it's so easy to travel with and my other
blushes I did just get a few color pops
but I haven't really tested them out yet
I do have an elf blush palette but I
feel like I don't want to bring the
whole palette with me so I just bring
along my Milani baked blush in dolce
pink I love it I use it almost on a
daily basis I think it's gorgeous so
that comes with me the bronzer that I
bring with me is the too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer and I have just
mini sample size and that works really
well for traveling I don't have to bring
a full-size bronzer with me love it we
do bring two mascaras and I love that I
have all these minis from my lash blast
to-go box that I got and I bring my two
favorites that I mentioned in that video
so it is the tart lights camera flashes
and the Too Faced better than sex
mascara so these little minis go with me
to Korres I have to bring a highlighter
with me I typically always reach for the
bucket cosmetics and your jaclyn hill
collaboration in champagne pop sometimes
I get really nervous to bring it because
I'm like what if something happens and
it breaks and I'm devastated but it's my
favorite highlighter so I usually end up
bringing it I know I know a few other
just like random things I bring is the
babe lash this is the eyelash serum I
know I mentioned it in one of like my
first videos maybe it was my mascara
video because it truly has made my
eyelashes grow and I really appreciate
this stuff so I put it on every single
day so of course that comes in my travel
bag and I also bring a teeth whitening
pen with me this one is from whitening
lightning and is there 0 white whitening
pen so it's just a I can open it it's
just a little pen like that you run it
over your teeth leave it on for a few
minutes and I usually just spit it out
rinse my mouth and teeth whitening
on-the-go other thing I have in my
travel bag is my Beauty Blender and this
is from Real Techniques and I think they
actually call it their beauty sponge and
I usually just throw it in my makeup bag
because I'll show my brushes next but I
don't actually have room for it in my
brushes even though it's considered more
of a tool versus makeup but of course
this has to come with me there's just no
question about it that is everything
that I need to have in my makeup bag
again these are pretty much only my
makeup products I'm not going to do hair
or skin care right now if you guys would
want to see like a what's in my travel
bag for hair or skin care please just
comment below and let me know and i'll
be happy to make that video too i mean i
could even do i could do just hair and
skin care I could do clothing and shoes
I mean you guys can comment below let me
know if you want to see that if you do I
will happily make that
one for you but next I'm going to hop
into brushes over brushes this is what
my brush case looks like and it came
with a BH Cosmetics brush set order I
have so many BH Cosmetics brush I
absolutely love them I think they're
very affordable and you also get a great
case which is really good for traveling
so when you open it up this is what it
looks like and these are my must have
brushes so I'll just start at the
beginning the first one is my foundation
brush this is the Sigma flat kabuki the
f80 this is just it's a great foundation
brush I definitely recommend it i'm so
happy i have it sigma is a little bit
more expensive when it comes to brushes
but this brush is so good is from the bh
cosmetics line this is what i use as my
blush brush I do really like it but I am
looking for a different blush brush
mostly because I just got a bunch of
color pop blushes not a lot I got to our
meal is so different you almost need
like a duo fiber brush and I know Real
Techniques just came out with a duo
fiber line so I'm really interested in
that but just looking to replace my
blush brush if anyone has any good
suggestions please comment below and let
me know I would love to hear them the
next one is also from BH Cosmetics and
this is just an angled brush and this is
what I use for like my bronzer and
contours I can really like contour out
my cheekbones and bronze with it the
next one is from elf and this is the
small tapered brush this is what I use
for setting my under eye concealer I
absolutely love it it's three dollars I
recommend everyone has this in their
collection then I bring along to
blending brushes and these are just my
favorite brushes of life like I use
these brushes every day these brushes go
everywhere with me if I could sleep with
my brushes these are the two that i
would pick but the first one is from BH
Cosmetics and it's just they're blending
brush absolutely love it it's really
thick and full and it's really great for
transition colors increased shades other
one is the Sigma blending brush it's the
e25 it's a little bit smaller in more
precise than the bh brush so this is
really good I really like to use this
one for blending all the colors together
like I like to use the vh1 to put the
colors on there and
take the smaller one and really define
the blend with it my ride-or-die brushes
just bring this is from bhcosmetics but
any sort of just regular old flat
eyeshadow brush for the colors that I
pack on my eyelid these two brushes are
what I use for like my lower lash line
these are both from bhcosmetics again
this one is just like their flat definer
brush absolutely great for picking up
product and just aligning your lower
lash line with it and then this one from
BH has the more pointed tip and I think
it's great for smudging and blending out
your lower lash line sometimes if I need
if I'm going to do something more
precise on my eyelids I will actually go
in and use this one as well so again
kind of like doubling up products trying
to save in my travel bag and I will just
like make the outer be with this brush
too and that works really well for that
and then the final brush I have is also
from ELF at star flawless concealer
brush and I just mentioned this in my
strobing video but this is my favorite
brush as of right now to use to
highlight with so I just highlight my
cheekbones cheekbones with this brush
and I think it works great again three
dollars at like target or the elf
website and love it I think it's great
for highlighting those are all of my
brushes in the handy little case I
definitely recommend like if you do want
a brush set I know sometimes it's hard
because when you get a brush that you
don't necessarily need every single
brush in there but if you also would
really like a case so you're not just
throwing your brushes in your bag when
you travel BH Cosmetics has really
affordable brushes they are really good
quality I think in my opinion especially
if you're just starting out this is what
I got when I first started getting
really into makeup I went to bh
cosmetics and ordered a set from them
and I think they're really good so I
really recommend them versus maybe not
knowing exactly what you're doing yet
with makeup or how exactly you do it or
what brushes you're going to gravitate
towards instead of going the Sigma R out
at first and spending you know 20 bucks
on a brush you can get a whole set for
like twelve dollars from BH Cosmetics
and then one last part just so you don't
think I forgot about lip products I
honest
Lee lip products are so hard for me
because i love them i have all of these
and then i also have a bunch of color
pop in this jar it is so hard for me to
say which are like my lipsticks that are
absolutely going to go with me because
it really depends on what I'm doing when
I'm traveling back to my husband's
hometown I tend to bring more like pinks
lighter pink the thing when I went to
Chicago when I was going to a baseball
game in a concert I brought gray and
bright red so it really just depends on
where i'm going to go but i will mention
a few of my favorite lipstick but i'm
not going to delve in the colour-pop
just yet because i still in testing a
lot of them out I do have a full color
pop video planned for you guys and go
over all the lippie Stix the ultra matte
liquid lipsticks and the blushes that i
got from um so I don't want to mention
them yet just because honestly I'm still
testing them out I've probably only worn
every lipstick twice so far and I just
feel like I need to have a better
opinion before I start saying like hey
this is my favorite one I just want to
be sure before I start throwing out
recommendations so I grab these this lip
liner will always go everywhere with me
the whorl from Mac and I really need to
sharpen it like this great pinkish
brownish color it's a really good pink
brown I guess I would say I just think
it's a beautiful lip liner paired with
so many colors it looks terrific for it
one to pair it with is probably
underground from Gerard cosmetics and
this is like a gray color when I wear it
without the lip liner it looks too gray
on me when I wear it with world it looks
perfect and I I love the combination so
that's underground other one from Gerard
cosmetics that I just love hands down is
buttercup and this is one that Jaclyn
hill collaborated with them to make it's
a beautiful light baby pink it is
stunning this is really good when I know
that I'm going like home or visiting
family just a great light pink is so
wonderful to have so that's buttercup
from Gerard cosmetics droid cosmetics is
more on the expensive side I think the
lipsticks are like nineteen dollars a
piece and do run sales and they have
like three package discounts for
lipstick discounts that sort of thing I
would definitely recommend finding them
on Instagram if you are interested in
getting them because they always
announce their sales there and then the
other two that I have are both drugstore
and the first one is from the l'oreal
collection it is JLo's nude a beautiful
nude shade it almost looks like it has a
pinkish tinge but it's a very light pink
like if you would put butter cup on it's
pink if you would put JLo's new Don it's
nude so it might look like it has a
little bit of pink to it but it's a
really terrific nude again if you're
doing something like visiting family
you're going out for a job interview
something like that a nude lip is really
great and the other one is bare it all
and this is from wet and wild this is
like a two-dollar lipstick the l'oreal
one was probably like eight dollars
wet'n'wild is so affordable and this is
just another really great nude so that's
it right there that's bare it all by wet
and wild I honestly don't love what we
got going on here but I mean for two
dollars like I'll get over it and I
really do love the shade I have heard
that it's a really good dupe for max
velvet teddy I don't own that so I can't
tell you that for sure but I have seen
that mentioned multiple times it's
actually why I bought it because it was
kathleenlights I can't remember now that
she did a Mac Duke video and she said
whoever it was said this was a dupe for
velvet teddy so I went out and bought it
I think it's absolutely beautiful I wear
it in a lot of my videos I just had it
on in my strobing video so if you want
to see what the lip color looked on me
that'll be below or up here or somewhere
but i think it's another great nude a
little bit more color to it than JLo's
new it has a little bit more of a pop on
your lips but it's so gorgeous my
favorite lipsticks I tried to give a
range depending on what I'd be doing but
again I just think about what it is that
I'm doing over that weekend and decide
do I want brighter lips do I want more
dramatic
klipsch am I going a more nude route it
really just depends on what exactly it
is that I'm doing and then I kind of pic
from there again my club pop video will
be coming in the next few weeks I just
want to make sure I get everything
tested out so when i do that video for
you and being as honest as I can be in
my recommendations so look for that to
be coming soon really hope you guys
