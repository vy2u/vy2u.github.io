I would like to welcome myself back to
filming YouTube videos I have been off
from filming for six days well I've been
vacationing in Arizona I've had pre
filmed videos going up while I was on
vacation but today is the first time
that I'm sitting down and filming in
almost one week which is pretty crazy I
actually was not planning on filming
today I was going to give myself the day
off to unpack and just get the house
back in order and you know catch up on
sleep and all of that fun stuff but as I
was getting ready to unpack my makeup I
thought maybe it would be an interesting
video to show you guys what I brought
with me on my vacation in terms of the
makeup the brushes that I packed and
also my skin care so I did a quick pull
on my Instagram stories and it seemed
like a lot of people thought that video
would be a good idea so I thought that I
would just quickly sit down and film and
show you guys what I brought with me on
my Arizona vacation and maybe talk about
my vacation a little bit share a few
photos on here and things like that so
that is what I'm going to be doing today
so if you would like to see what I
packed for a 6-day 5-night vacation into
the desert why don't we go ahead and get
started with today's video so I am gonna
do my makeup first and I thought it
would be fun to do the makeup look that
I basically just repeatedly wore this in
Arizona is super simple super easy but
the first day we got there really late
Wednesday night we got to our hotel
probably like 11:30 p.m. which would
have been 1:30 a.m. our time so we were
super tired we just went to bed and then
Thursday we were pretty excited to like
get out and about and start exploring
and seeing things and it was my best
friend chanath birthday that's why we do
these trips last year it's be my husband
my best friend Shannon and her husband
Matt our birthdays are all within a
really close timeframe so last year we
did a road trip to Colorado this year we
decided to go to Arizona
so Machinist birthday so we wanted to
get out pretty quickly so when I was
looking at my makeup this is the look
that I did and I felt like it held up
really well we did a lot of like walking
that day it was super super more about
very sunny and I felt like everything
held up really well and so on Friday
that one
actually my birthday and we were going
to a Cubs spring training game which is
a big reason why we picked going to
Arizona we thought it would be cool to
see a spring training game for the Cubs
myself Shannon and Matt are all Cubs
fans my husband is a White Sox fan it's
very interesting and so we thought it
would be fun to go to a game and I knew
it was going to be extremely warm the
game was at one o'clock in the afternoon
so I knew that it was gonna be a hot day
and so I thought well I really liked my
makeup look from yesterday I bet it held
up really well you know nothing was like
sweating off or anything like that so I
was like I'll just do it again and it
just kind of became like my go-to look
it was super easy like what you know
we're getting ready in the morning to go
and I didn't even have to think about it
so that's the look that I decided to go
with today this is basically what I
looked like in Arizona during our trip
but so this is the makeup bag that I
packed with me it's still a packed full
of makeup so this bag is from a flower
beauty if I can find it on their website
I'll go ahead and link it down below but
I like it because it's just really large
this is what it looks like on the inside
so it has three different compartments
actually it has one over here that has a
zipper and then there's a small one
right here and then you also have
another one here that has like more of
like a mesh bag so I just think it's
really easy to pack everything up in and
it rolls up pretty easily and you know
this was perfect for me for all of my
makeup for you know the six days that we
were there so let me show you what I
brought with me for makeup maybe try to
go in somewhat of an order here if I if
I can for the most part I packed two
different primers both of these are from
a flower beauty I should talk about
these quite a bit I packed the hydrating
one since I knew that we were going to
the desert this is gonna be super dry I
already deal dry skin so I packed my
hydrating primer and then I also packed
the pore minimizing primer because
sometimes I can deal with larger pores
sometimes I wear this one on its own but
I also do like to combine them just kind
of depending on what my skin looks like
when I wake up that morning but those
are the two primers that I brought with
me I brought two different foundations
with me and I ended up only using one
the whole time but these are both like
the squeeze tubes because I just thought
that that would be easier to pack
instead of dealing with a glass bottle
or anything or like a cap
come off or anything like that so these
are the two that I chose I packed the
Charlotte Tilbury light wonder
foundation I really like this foundation
because it leaves such a natural finish
it's super super lightweight on the skin
but it also gives good coverage at the
same time but I ended up not even using
it because the first day I went with the
Loreal Pro glow foundation this is one
of my favorite foundations and it's
almost empty that's a big reason to why
I decided to use this one the first six
that was like I'd be really cool if I
could you know work on emptying it and I
did not empty it yet
I used it again today but it's pretty
much it's almost out I have the shade
207 is sand beige but again just just
one of my favorite foundations and I
thought I'd get held up a really good
throughout the heat and everything it
still looked good at the end of the
night it gives a little bit of glow I
like the coverage to it so those are my
foundation choices did pack a face
powder with me this one is the
Maybelline butter skin skin at
transforming powder I like this one
because it does have a mirror it's a
nice compact and I do like the little
sponge applicator that comes with it but
it's also just a really nice powder
there was a couple days where I just
didn't really feel like doing anything
in the morning especially the Saturday
night we actually stayed in Flagstaff we
rented a car on Saturday and we drove up
to the Grand Canyon we drove through
Sedona first which was super beautiful
and then we went to the Grand Canyon and
then we ended up staying in Flagstaff we
stayed at like a casino resort that
night and so we were in the casino for a
while and then we were in the hot tub so
I like where I am which was crazy so the
next morning as we were getting ready to
drive back into town I was just like I
don't really want to do anything so I
just put some powder in my face and
called it a day but I really do like
this powder so I thought that would be a
good one to bring with me I also packed
this a from here this is their contour
Diaries I really do like this palette
but I packed it for a couple different
reasons it does have a mirror which is
nice and that's basically how I did my
make up the majority of days was in this
mirror but it does have setting powders
too and I really wanted a setting powder
for my under eyes and I just figured
because this one also has contour and
bronzer shades I was getting three
different uses in one palette so that's
why I decided to go with this one I
typically use this as my setting powder
and I use this as my contour shade each
day I didn't use the bronzer as much
I actually also packed along my
physician's formula butter bronzer and
this was mostly the bronzer that I used
this one is in my 2018 project pan which
I actually was going to film the update
video either today or tomorrow it's
gonna have this one be my next video
that I filmed but then I figured this
would be a good one to do as I'm
unpacking my makeup and whatnot so that
update video will be coming but because
I know that this one is in the project
pan and it's also just a really nice
bronzer I mean I just I just enjoy this
bronzer anyways so that is mostly the
bronzer that I use for the most part on
the trip I was also going to show you
guys the shirt that I'm wearing because
I know you can't read the whole thing
but my shirt says this girl runs on
books ice cream and gangsta rap which I
thought was super funny my best friend
got this for me for my birthday so I
thought I'd wear it today I just thought
it was super cute obviously I want to
show you guys that as well and see for
blush I ended up grabbing this palette
from lorac it's their one with Beauty
and the Beast because it comes with
three different blushes and I kind of
just alternated between all of them
sometimes I've mixed them together but I
really like this palette and I really
like the blushes in here and it also
does have a gold highlight which I was
like maybe if I'm feeling a little
toilet one day I would also have it in
here but I mostly brought this along for
the blushes and this is what I used for
blushes on my trip for highlight I
actually decided to grab the Urban Decay
and Kristen LeAnn highlight palette this
one is called the beauty be matte
palette and this is what I did use for
the most part it does have in here as
well and then I typically just combined
these two shades and that's what I have
as my highlight for today as well so
that was what I'm mostly used for
highlight on the trip but I really do Oh
like that palette as well and then let's
see oh I have concealers in here I
packed two different concealers both
from Urban Decay i did the naked skin
which is my favorite concealer and this
is what i used the majority of for my
under eyes i used it as an eye primer
cuz i forgot an eye primer i realized
that the first day i forgot an eye
primer so i was using this one as an eye
primer and this one i was mainly using
to like spot conceal because it's so
full coverage that it really covers up
any imperfections so well so that's
mostly what I was using the all nighter
for but that is the concealer
combination
that I grabbed I have a few different
liners in here for the different liners
the one that I have today is this one
from Rimmel it's in the nude one of the
exaggerated liners it's just a really
nice like beige liner and I thought it
complemented kind of like my daytime
looks like this was like my daytime look
quite a bit and then if I was going out
then I was putting on usually the Sigma
long wear pencil these pencils are so
bomb from Sigma I have been loving on
them and then one night I also did do
the Urban Decay this is the 24/7
glide-on eye pencil and deep end which
is a really pretty teal so it just can
kind of liven up the look as we went
into like a nighttime look and then the
liquid liner that I chose is also from
Sigma this is the wicked liquid liner
these new pencils from Sigma I just
think are amazing and I almost didn't
bring them on the trip because I was so
worried that like I would lose them or
like leave them behind somewhere or
something and I almost I thought that I
did at one point I think it was our last
day there I thought it had fallen out of
my little backpack and I was devastated
I was so upset with myself but I ended
up fighting it but these liners are just
really good so brought along two
different brow pencils I packed like
kind of two of everything I mean some do
have more but for the most part it was
like two foundations and two concealers
two browser options to highlight options
things like that and it's just mostly
just so I can have a choice I mean does
anybody else like that like you just you
want to have a choice you don't want to
be completely stuck in this box even
though I ended up doing mostly the same
thing but I like to have options but I
brought with me the Maybelline a total
temptation brow definer and one of my
favorite brow pencils I've been raving
about it I have it in my brows today and
then I also grabbed at the benefit
precisely my brow pencil again one of my
favorites I just I love both of these
pencils and I feel like they're just
really easy and quick for me to do and
I'm not you know super spectacular
eyebrows or anything so those just make
it easy for me the two of mascaras that
I chose this one is from a flower beauty
it's the zoom-in ultimate mascara again
one of my favorite mascaras I talked
about this one quite a bit so that one
came with me and then also I grabbed out
the Lancome Hypnose drama
I actually tossed a couple of my
mascaras so I opened this one because
I've had it for a while I just haven't
opened it yet and it's actually also in
my project pan and so I opened it a
couple days before the trip and news
and I was like this is why I already had
a backup because I had a many of this
one and then I bought the full-size and
I was like I remember this is why I
absolutely love this mascara I have it
on today so this was actually like kind
of my go to mascara down there I know I
did wear flower beauty at least one time
but it was mostly the Lancome one that I
was wearing so I just loved that mascara
and it held up really well even the day
that we saw the Cubs and it was I mean
it was scorching hot that day let me
tell you I mean it was only like I think
the high got to be like 82 but just
sitting with the Sun beaming down on you
and like no relief we kept having to
take breaks just to go stand in the
shade because it was so warm I mean not
that I'm complaining because when we
came back as 36 degrees with the cold
rain here in Iowa but we were having to
take breaks but my makeup again held up
so well I had nothing running on my face
I had no mascara transfer or anything
like that so lancome did pretty good
so in here let me show you the eye
palette that I brought with me I didn't
feel annoyed I went super crazy with my
eyeshadow palettes which I was pretty
proud of myself but the one that I ended
up wearing the most and what I have on
today is dose of colors marvelous Moz
this is probably the the palette that I
travel with the most its small its
compact it has a mirror
I love the shades inside it's just it's
easy for me to use they're pigmented
they're blendable I mean it's just like
a no-brainer for me typically what I do
is I put these at first the second and
third shades into my crease and I put
the lightest shade on my lid on the
inner corner of my brow bone and then I
put the third and fourth shades on my
lower lash line and then if we were
going out for the night look I was
basically just taking again this fourth
shade and buffing that into the crease a
little bit heavier and putting on a
black eyeliner and that was it so this
was like that's the palette that I used
almost every single day I also did grab
out the hood of beauty warm Brown
obsessions I did wear this one day as
well I just took two I took this brown
shade right here took the top middle
brown shade and boom that was all that I
did for my eye look as well but I
grabbed up this one and also the hood of
beauty of smokey obsessions they're just
you know small I like the shades in
there again pigmented blendable all of
that good stuff but they're also really
good I mean I felt like all these were
really good travel sizes and whatnot and
I wasn't really worried about you know
like some policy or just worried about
breaking and shattering and all of that
so I felt confident with all of these
pellets in here but yeah these were the
only pellets that I packed it ended up
mostly using dose of colors but a little
bit of the hood of beauty as well and
that was it for palettes I did bring
along lashes but shockingly enough I did
not wear lashes one time I brought the
pure diva lashes with me duh and then I
also brought the more feature Mia lashes
these lashes are super super pretty and
they remind me of the peered evil ashes
as well but those are two lashes that I
love and then I brought along my duo
dark tone adhesive and then also my
Tarte little lash helper to put lashes
on but again I did not wear lashes once
it was just mostly because I was busy
and I didn't want to take the time to do
it I liked the way my eye looks were
looking and again a lot of times when I
was thinking about getting ready during
the day I was thinking about the heat
and being outside and doing a lot of
walking and things like that and I just
didn't want to deal with sweating and
all of that and then by the time we got
to night like when I was like switching
over to the night look or switching
clothes or things like that I was just
like you know what I'm having fun I
don't want to be just like of so
concerned about my makeup I just want to
have a good time and you know be with my
friends and enjoying our trip so I
actually did not use lashes at all I
also brought a glitter with me this is
one of the Stila glitters and this is in
bronze bail I ended up not using this I
was going to the night of my birthday
after we got back from the Cubs game we
went the pool for a while and then we
were getting ready to go out to dinner
and I was like I should put glitter on
tonight you know it's my birthday I like
have a little bit of fun and again it
was just like no I don't watch it I
don't want to be like super concerned
with my makeup I don't want to take a
lot of time doing anything like I just
want to have fun enjoy my vacation I
really did a good job unplugging from
social media I felt like you know like I
said I had pre filmed videos going up
but it was super easy in the morning
just from my phone boom publish the
video you know set a couple things on
you know Instagram and snapchat and
Twitter like I'll have my videos up and
then I unplugged for for the majority
and I was pretty proud of myself for
doing that so I really felt like I just
was able to enjoy it and I wasn't so
stressed and I don't really
good time the setting spray that I
brought with me is from flower beauty
it's the seal the deal at long-lasting
setting spray this is in the matte
finish and I thought about bringing the
dewy one because of being in the dry
desert and all of that but this one's
just really my favorite and I feel like
it really does lock makeup into place so
that's why I wanted to bring it and I
just carried this with me and my little
mini backpack and like especially during
the Cubs game I was just like spraying
it on my face to get like some sort of
like relief and hydration back and so I
really do like this guy and then also in
the last thing that's in my makeup bag
this is from color science I did a video
recently where I was talking about this
one it's the total I three and one
renewal therapy it's a color corrector
for the eyes but this thing I mean I
talked about it in the video but this
helps me out so much especially in the
mornings if we were just gonna run out
quick somewhere if we were just like
going to the pool or something like that
again the morning of Flagstaff or I
didn't want to get ready and we had to
get up at 4:30 to catch our like 6:30
flight or whatever leaving Arizona and
again this is what I use it just
corrects dark circles it makes your
under eyes look brighter it just helps
me so much it's got like a peachy tone
to it it's not like a concealer where
you need to like set it or you need to
worry about creasing or anything like
that I literally just put it on and go
the applicator is cooling which helps a
lot but this thing was like a lifesaver
for me only had to bring that but that
is everything in my makeup bag and then
I'll show you the brushes that I packed
too as I went to pull my brushes out I
was like oh yes I also do pack my
lipsticks in here it's what I did this
time so guess you're like wait where did
your lipsticks go
I packed him in with my brushes so
that's why but when I pack my brushes I
have this a case here from Delhi until I
kit I think it looks really cool it has
a nice zipper it also has a ton of rail
mitt so I can pack all my brushes in
there I have a makeup sponge in there
and then in this little compartment here
is where I packed all of my different
lipsticks I don't ask me why I did that
but I did and I'm just gonna pull the
brushes out and run through them quickly
and show you guys what I decided to pack
this one here is the Sigma e60 to cut
crease this is what I use to apply an
eyelid primer or you know my concealer
since I forgot my lip rubber and that's
what I used to apply it on my eyelid I
also packed the Sigma e25 which is a
blending brush the more feet a36 this is
what I use for my inner corner and
problem I also packed the Sigma shader
inner corner e46 this is just a really
small flat shader brush I like to use it
for things like glitter so that's what I
I brought it for in case I want to be
spreading glitter or doing anything
really detailed I have that one the
Sigma e-40 is just a fabulous blending
brush used it almost every single day
and then also the Sigma cream color 858
and this is really good for packing
shadows on to the lid I also packed here
this is a Mota metallic super crease a
lot of times I come in and use this for
my first shade color like a white or
bone color to kind of set the eyelid
primer I also have from a moto metallics
this is the shader brush again just
another flat shader brush
I didn't bring with me like my cinema
secrets or anything like that to be
cleaning my brushes in between so just
in case I was doing a lot of like
different colorful looks or things like
that I wanted to be able to have
different brushes and not have to worry
about like transferring colors and you
know all that fun stuff I also packed
the dull iam tools a tapered a blending
brush I love this blending brush I think
it's fabulous the Sigma short shader e
20 just a small brush this is actually
what I'm mostly used to pack that really
light purple shade from dose of colors
onto the lid since I didn't need a lot
of like lid space with it and that's a
pretty small brush also the morphe m 507
this is what i use it to put on lower
lash eyelid color the morphe 27 again
just another blending brush I just
wanted to make sure I had plenty just in
case I was switching around a different
shades and all of that
moving over I think I have mostly based
brushes here these are two of my
favorite contour and bronzer brushes
again from Mona metallics this is the
contour brush that I use for contour and
this is the buff brush buffer buff it
just says buff brush that I use for my
bronzer I have the morphe 3 this is just
what I like to use either for powder or
just to kind of like make sure
everything is blended together on to my
skin that's one of my favorite brushes I
have the Sigma tapered highlight f-35 my
highlight brush i have the morphe 49 and
this is what i use to apply powder to my
under eyes love it's the sephora 57
brush my favorite concealer brush ever I
have the Sigma f40 this is what I use as
my blush
and then also the Sigma f80 what I use
for a foundation brush I also brought
with me the Sigma sponge this is their
sponge that is now back in stock so
that's a good thing that is the sponge
and that I brought with me and then
moving on to the lip products I wanted
to show you these in here I did bring
with me from the balm this is the
coconut bomb.com so this is just like I
really like nourishing lip balm and one
of my favorites so I brought that one
with me
I also brought dose of colors stone you
knew you're gonna see does the colors in
here I brought with me maybelline
truffle tease I love truffle tease just
look really easy new to wear this Kat
Von D Ludwig is what I'm wearing today
this is what I wore most nights out I
feel like the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
they just last a really long time on me
and I really like this shade that is
that one
I also brought hooda beauty with me and
whyphy probably not surprised to see
this either Marc Jacobs this is the
sugar sugar lip gloss and then I also
brought with me Urban Decay backtalk
I've been really obsessed with this one
also and finish it off I thought I would
show you my skincare so this is what I
packed my skincare in I do not remember
where I got this bag I've had it for a
really long time but I really like it
and I feel like it fits my skincare
items and they're really well so I did
bring with me these are the Olay Daly
facials they're a 5 and 1
water-activated dry cloth so they can
remove makeup cleanse tone exfoliate and
hydrate so they are actually just a dry
cloth and you just get them wet with
water and then you just rub them all
over your face so these are what they
look like so I love traveling with these
because all I did I knew we were gonna
be there for 5 nights I grabbed out 5
and just put them in my bag it's super
easy you don't have to worry about like
the bulk or I mean anything like that I
just grab the 5 out and slip them into
my makeup bag and every night that I
took my makeup off because I did you
know take your makeup off every night
even when you're on vacation you don't
get you don't get a vacation from taking
your makeup off but that's what I use to
take my makeup off I feel like they're
so just super easy to travel with the
affresh a soy face cleanser this is
mostly what I use for my cleanser in the
morning one of my favorite cleansers and
almost everything I just have one
product but almost everything was like a
mini or travel sized version or travel
friendly version which is super nice I
love collecting minis and travel sizes
especially
for something like this where we were
gonna be gone for five nights like I
knew I wanted to bring good skincare
with me but I didn't want to take up a
ton of room so all right love this guy I
brought these two from milk makeup these
are I feel like they're pretty travel
friendly this is the matcha cleanser
which I'm I'm getting pretty down there
on that one and then also the matcha
toner again I just really like traveling
with these I feel like they're really
easy to travel with
I also brought with me the Kate
Somerville exfoli Kate I did want to
bring in an exfoliator with me as well I
only use this one time on the trip but
it was when like my skin started to get
really dry and I feel like I just wanted
to just really get everything buffed off
my skin that's when I went with this guy
and it works really well let's see I
also brought with me this is from
Dermalogica it's the calm water gel it
says this a weightless water gel
moisturizer to hydrate dry sensitive
skin this is super hydrating you need
the tiniest drop of this and it's just
it's so intensely hydrating so again
knowing that's going to the desert I
already deal with dry skin I really
wanted to bring this and it really does
help me out the night cream that I
brought with me this was the only thing
that wasn't necessarily like travel
friendly but I'm almost out of it and I
was gonna try to help you know finish it
up on the trip this is from Garnier skin
active it's the ultralift miracle
sleeping cream so this is what I use as
my night cream I also brought with me
that Lula Hendrickson truth serum this
is mostly what I used in the morning and
I just I love this stuff I think it's
fantastic and I got a little chapel
sized guy of it so I thought that worked
out well I do have the Sunday Riley CEO
the repair moisturizer again I'm also
just brought this because it's a little
guy it's not my favorite moisturizer at
all but I thought I could like put
somewhat of a dent into it on my trip I
don't really feel like I did a great job
mostly because I was mostly using the
Dermalogica one but it's it's just okay
but I thought I could use it up on the
trip and of course for eye creams with
me because I need that this is the Olay
eyes deep hydrating eye gel I'm almost
out of this as well but it's just one of
my favorite idols it's really cooling
for the morning which I think it's great
and at night I mostly used the Shishido
benef yawns wrinkle resist 24 intensive
eye contour cream I actually
like this obviously this is like a
little tiny sample guy of I but I was
really good
I'm scared to see what the full size
price of this is because it's just a
dough but those are the two eye creams
that I brought with me as well and
lastly for skincare I did bring it to a
sheet mask with me I brought from
pathology this is the flash mask the
hydrate one again I wanted something
very hydrating I put this on on Thursday
so again we got in super late Wednesday
and Thursday before we did anything I
just figured you know I already have dry
skin I'm just I'm on a plane I know I'd
like I see people use sheet masks on a
plane which i think is pretty funny
so right when I woke up in the morning
and this is what I put on and I feel
like it really did help my skin and then
the other one that I used was from bio
Bell I don't have an extra one of that
but it is the happy hour sheet mask I'll
have everything linked down below of
course I used that one on Sunday and
again I really needed it for hydration
and just to to help my skin the Saturday
night was definitely our latest night
there like I said we were up till like
3:00 a.m. in the resort hot tub most hot
tubs closed at like our first hotel that
we say that I've got the first three
nights it closed like nine o'clock or 10
o'clock or something but since I don't
know most been different cuz it was a
casino resort they let us stay in there
till 3 o'clock no one even kicked us out
we left on our own accord you know I was
super tired my skin was feeling the
effects of staying up that late and just
doing all the different traveling we
were doing and it was just super dry so
I actually went to put like concealer on
Sunday morning while we were at the
resort and my skin basically was like no
do not put anything on me right now and
I was like I'm sorry I'm sorry skin I'm
trying to treat you so nice so we
actually started driving and we stopped
for lunch and stuff but when we got to
our next hotel which was in Gilbert
Arizona the first thing that I did was
put that sheet mask on and then I put
makeup on and my skin was so much
happier like I'm so glad I brought two
sheet masks with me and I was able to
use that one because otherwise I have no
idea how I was gonna put makeup on my
skin it was just dry and irritated and
mad at me so that was my saving grace
but other than that after those at two
sheet masks and that is everything that
I brought with me on my return trip okay
so that is going to do it for today's
video I know I was getting asked so many
questions my friend Liv from locals her
makeup does live in Arizona as well I
was getting asked a lot if we were going
to meet up at all and our schedules
could not work out she has been super
busy with her work and she texted me a
few days prior and said she had to work
15 hour days the days that we were gonna
be there we were only in her area of
town for two days and it was a Thursday
Friday which you know obviously our work
days and then we traveled you know the
four hours to the Grand Canyon and such
so we were not able to meet up I know I
just figured I was gonna get asked some
questions about that but she's actually
moving closer to me in a couple months
here I know she's said that on her
social media accounts as well and we
will definitely do a meet-up even said
it when she is closer up to me and I can
go visit her she can come visit me or
something but unfortunately we weren't
able to make that work but we still had
such a good time in Arizona we crammed
so many things into that trip like when
we go places because we travel with this
couple quite a bit when we go I mean we
go we very rarely have any downtime like
I said we run in a car we drove the four
hours and even took a little bit more
time because we wanted to drive to
Sedona we wanted to see the Grand Canyon
we were boom boom boom all over the
Grand Canyon we were seeing different
spots of it like it was it was a wild
trip like I said I wasn't planning on
filming today so if you notice that I'm
a little bit tired
it's because I'm a little bit tired but
it actually kind of helped me out
because I had to unpack this stuff
anyways and I figure I could probably
just show you but thank you guys so much
for all of the birthday wishes like I
said my birthday was on Friday when we
were gone I was doing a really good job
like I said staying off social media and
being unplugged but I still saw all of
the messages coming in and I thank you
guys so much it was a great birthday I'm
so excited to see what thirty-one gets
me I'm very confused as to I didn't mean
any Cubs players on Friday I can't quite
figure I'm not really mmm don't know why
that didn't happen but I still had a
really great birthday it was awesome
spending it in great weather and
sunshine and just being able to be
outdoors and seeing a new spot was a
great birthday vacation I couldn't have
asked for it for anything better for my
birthday I hope my husband had fun I
hope my friends had fun it was a great
trip and a lot of memories so thank you
guys for all the birthday wishes but
other than that that's gonna do it for
