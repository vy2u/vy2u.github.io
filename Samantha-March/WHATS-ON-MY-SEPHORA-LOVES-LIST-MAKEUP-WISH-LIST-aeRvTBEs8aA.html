today's video is gonna be a little bit
different I'm just going to be quickly
going over what is on my current Sephora
loves list I asked this in a video the
other day because I was chatting about
something that was on my loves list and
I asked if you would want to see that
video and so many people said yes I had
a different video idea in mind for today
but because I got so much feedback on
asking that question I thought I'm gonna
go ahead and film this today so I'm just
gonna run through what is on my current
loves list at Sephora so if you are
interested in seeing those products let
me go ahead and get started
all right so I've seen other people of
course do this type of video and
typically they're showing the love slows
on their computer I use my loves list as
just a shopping list for myself at
Sephora so I have items on there for
like upcoming giveaways gift ideas
things like that so if I were to just
show my entire love's list and feel like
well why aren't you talking about that
product or that product exists and it's
because it's not necessarily for me so
I'm just gonna run through I just have
the list pulled up on my phone and I'm
just gonna run through it here on camera
that's why I'm doing it in this type of
fashion
I will also say I did get a comment
asking like yes please do the Sephora
loves this video and also maybe do a
video on what's on my lust list but I
just haven't bought or like can't get
myself to buy and I did respond back to
that comment and said I did a video like
that fairly recently so I'll go ahead
and leave that one link down below too
it's called something like probably
Cosette never make it onto my Sephora
cart and that's exactly what I'm talking
about
item setup and on my love list for a
while but I just can't get myself to by
jumping into it I don't know how many
foundations I have on here I probably
should have looked at over a little
closely but first one is a foundation
this is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
invisible cover stick foundation which
is $43 I recently did talk about the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
like the regular liquid foundation and I
actually put that in my underwhelming
makeup products video because I feel
like that's really a cult favorite I
kind of feel like both of these are and
I ended up getting that one for review
but I still have the stick foundation on
my list but now I'm kind of like I don't
know if I should try that one too I like
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
but it did turn into like an absolute
favorite and considering how many people
love that foundation I was kind of like
shouldn't I have loved it as well but I
still have that one on there let me know
what you think
this one I've had on my list forever as
well this is from tacho and it's the
water cream which is $68 it's their
moisturizer attached it is super
expensive like a luxury high-end
skincare brand but I always heard really
good things about the water cream so
it's been on my loves list forever my
friend live from live loves her makeup
did send me a little touch of best
sellers kit a couple months back and the
water cream was included in there and
yeah I love it so that's good $68 oh
there's that it's gonna continue to stay
on my love's list $60 is just a really
high price for a moisturizer but I
really really did enjoy it so I'm glad
that I was able to try the sample first
I think that that's really awesome so I
really enjoy it
I and I do want to buy it maybe during
like the vib sale I could purchase it or
something with the 20% off but I really
do like it
let's go stick around of all those lists
also on here is the fresh soy face
cleanser for $38 this is one that I also
mentioned in products that don't make it
out of my cart because I always have
this in my love's list but I continually
purchase like mini sizes I just got a
little sample set from Sephora the fresh
so a cleanser came in that one in a mini
sized like I always have mini guys of
this cleanser so I don't know if I'll
ever purchase the full size since I
always seem to find a mini somewhere but
I really do enjoy that cleanser up next
I have on here and this is kind of just
a general one but it's from makeup
forever it's the artist face color
highlight sculpt and blush powder
they're 23 dollars each I actually did
purchase some of these for my testing
subscribers favorite makeup video which
I'll leave linked down below I purchased
a contour shade and then also I actually
got a little like 100 point perk of the
blush but they recently came out with a
bunch of different blush and contour
bronzer shades highlight shades and you
can either purchase one you can purchase
two and a palette or three in a palette
and you actually get a little bit of a
deal and I do want to still create I
think a three pan palette but it's
actually a really good value I feel like
so it's $45 with a $71 value or the two
pan palette is 35 for a $48 value so I
still kind of want to put
my own little three pan together I think
that would be really nice and especially
for traveling like I like that you're
able to customize it and have like all
your favorite shades in there so I still
have that one on my loves list another
item here is from the Sephora collection
it's their cream lip stain liquid
lipstick and these are $14 each I
believe I mentioned this in my items I
don't make it on my Sephora cart and so
many people wrote in saying these are
some of our favorites you have like 10
plus different shades of this one so I
definitely want to try these out one of
the shades that I do have selected is in
copper blush that was one I chose for me
and I know when I was in Sephora fairly
recently during the VIP sale i swatched
a bunch and I want to say there was one
that end it with like peony or have the
word peony in there that I really
enjoyed because i swatched a bunch of my
hands so I do I feel like I want to get
some of those for only $14 I don't think
that's a bad price I'm also on here I
have the Laura Mercier flawless a fusion
ultra long wear foundation for $48 I
actually got a sample of this guy I
think it was like a point perk or some
sort of like weekly deal or something at
sapore so I got a sample of it and
actually really enjoyed it I requested
the sample because so many people were
talking about the foundation and I was
like you know I'll try it I'm not a big
I like full coverage type of girl so I
was a little worried I wouldn't enjoy it
but I actually ended up really loving it
to the point where I came in and put it
on my loves list so I don't know I'm so
I'm still considering that wouldn't for
sure I have some lashes on here from
blocking a beauty they're $25 each I
actually have two of the lashes already
I have the Styles Coquette and bombast
but I would be totally happy to have
more they are expensive though at $25 so
this one I mentioned in my makeup I
won't pay full price for like makeup
items that I really enjoy but they're
just so expensive I would have to
purchase these during something like a
vib sale because that's just a lot of
money also on here is the Tarte pearl
pearl a girl vegan teeth whitening pen
for $22 I just mentioned this in makeup
I don't regret buying and I think maybe
that's where I mentioned something of
this is on my love's list I didn't like
it at first but now I really do like it
don't regret buying it it's on my love's
list so I can repurchase so I really
enjoy that one I used to it right before
I went to film this video as well it
just realize I haven't
in the viewfinder like at all like
hopefully I wasn't framed this alt I
have no idea um next up there I have
another foundation this is one I've been
up still I'm not a hundred percent on
but it's been on my love's list since it
came out this is from huda beauty the
faux filter foundation it's $40 my shade
has been out of stock though forever so
even if I wanted to purchase this one I
would not be able to because I think
like the three shades that I had picked
out for myself I think they've all been
out of stock forever it still says it's
out of stock so has anyone tried that
one I don't know I feel like they here
really mixed reviews so I'm not a
hundred percent on that one but it's all
my loves list also on here is from Marc
Jacobs Beauty it's the Highlander matte
gel eye crayon pencil which is $25 the
shade I really want is pink of me I have
like for like for sure three I think
four maybe five of the highlighters from
Marc Jacobs Beauty because they're one
of the best eyeliners around and I
really want this kind of soft pink color
I hear Babs Beauty talking about it a
lot and she's always using it and I just
I really want it I like kind of that
light pale color in the waterline I
think it's really pretty that's another
one though that I would like to get on
sale because $25 for an eye liner that's
pretty pricey
next up still take this I feel love this
girl nope okay this is from Tom Florence
the bronzer brush it's $115 yeah ah yeah
I put this one in items I don't make it
out of my Sephora cart and I was like I
don't know if there will ever be a day
that I will spend 115 dollars on a brush
ever but it just hangs out on my love
list it just it just chills there can't
think I'm ever going to be able to
purchase that but for some reason I just
can't remove it from my loves list I
don't know what it is but that's a
there's that mmm hey so on there some
skincare this is the Tarte friction
stick exfoliating cleanser for $22 I
really enjoy this item I actually tried
to purchase it during the vib sale and
it was sold out which I was super bummed
about but I really enjoy it especially
to throw on my shower because it's a
dark exfoliating stick so it's a little
bit messy so I liked having a my
shower really easy to clean once I am
done and it's one of my favorites easy
to travel with really enjoy it next
thing on there is the solo de Janeiro
Brazilian boom boom crema for $45 I
actually did just get a trio sent to me
from octoly which I'm super excited
about and I reviewed it in my latest
makeup mouth day from December I put it
in the fine category because I do think
it's pretty good I do kind of want to
sparingly use it right now because I do
want to try it more towards like
spring/summer as well because I hear
people say that it does good things for
the legs like it makes the legs just
look better and like firmer and younger
and all of those good things but during
the winter you know I'm I live in Iowa
so I'm wearing you know like snow pants
to bed because I'm so cold I'm just
kidding I've never owned snow pants
because your girl's not going out there
there's no no I kind of want to say but
one of them at least for that but I love
the sentiment so much it's so hard not
to grab for it right now some like you
just smell so beautiful so in here I
have the Sephora collection of Sephora
warm pearl palette for $68 it is out of
stock right now but I also mentioned
this and makeup that doesn't make it out
of my cart because this one is one that
I've just continually gone back and
forth on like I was almost sold on it
right away I talk to myself out of it
because of the price then I heard good
reviews about it so I talked himself
back into it and I talked myself back
out of it now it's out of stock so it's
basically out of my hands at this moment
but I don't know it screams me I just
don't know if I need it especially for
sixty dollars mixed up I think this was
also on the list the hourglass
confession ultra slim high-intensity
lipstick for $34 I think I think the
packaging is what's really calling to me
on this one
hourglass is definitely pricey and it
just it doesn't seem like you're getting
a ton of product and $34 for one
lipstick it's expensive so don't know if
I'll ever be trying that one out of the
Laura Mercier translucent loose a
setting powder for $38 I'm really
excited I just had a subscriber a sudden
one to me she said she had an extra and
she sent one along to me so I'm really
excited to be able to try this one I am
I am it's coming I swear to you it's
coming my cult favorites like testing
cult favorite makeup products and
reviewing them I swear it's coming I
have the Kat Von D shade + light contour
palette on today
mmm yes I am getting this video put
together very soon and now I can include
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder so try to not out very shortly
also on my list is the Becca shimmering
skin perfector pressed prismatic I don't
know the name cuts off it's a
highlighter the one in amethyst for $38
I've wanted this on for so long and I
love by the highlights but they're just
really expensive like 38 dollars I'm
like I don't know if I'll ever get that
one but it looks really pretty I do
think it looks pretty also on here the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
for $64 another one that I said I don't
know if this is ever going to make it
out of my cart everybody was raving
about this foundation like for a while
I'm YouTube this was everybody's
favorite everybody was using it I just
don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it
because 64 I mean that is pretty high
like I feel like some of the highest
that I will go is like in the $50 range
you know but once we get to 64 I'm like
the next three it's kind of funny that
they're all in a row because I got all
of these for Christmas my sister-in-law
had my name because we draw names for
Christmas and she sent me a text one day
and asked me what I want it and I was
like hold please and I took a bunch of
screenshots of my love's list and sent
them to her and she got me these three
items which is super cool but the huda
beauty obsessions eyeshadow palette in
smokey so I'm gonna be trying that soon
yes those $27.00 also the drive are
detox
dry shampoo I just asked for the mini
guy which is 13 dollars just to see if I
like it I feel like I've never really
found a dry shampoo that works great for
me so far I've only tried it twice but
it's in did seem to work pretty well and
then also the cover FX perfect light
mini highlighter which is $10 again this
was just a mini size so I could try it
out I mean highlights are so hard to go
through anyways I do have it on my
cheekbones today it's in the color
moonlight but I've been wanting to try
the cover FX highlights for a while I
hear really good things about them
especially the palettes so I got all
three of those things for Christmas so
thank you to my sister lot stuff I have
the tarte clay play face is shaping
palette 2 for $46
if you guys have seen my alcohol and
Tryon video I talked for like I don't
know 12 minutes about this palette and
why I am upset that they discontinued
with the clay play one for the clay play
to all just all my thoughts about the
clay play to
is on my loves list because I did want
to purchase it I did end up purchasing
it and then I ended up returning it
because I was not happy about a lot of
things that palette so also money here
from violet boss is the hashtag Pro
eyeshadow palette for $45 I mentioned
this in a will I buy it video I said I
was really intrigued by it and so I'm
definitely thinking of getting that I
actually have two Sephora gift cards
just like burning a hole in my pocket
right now I really need to buy some
things but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get
that ballot like I'm pretty sure I am
also on here some things I that I add
I'm like girl what are you doing but
this is the YSL Touche Eclat blur primer
for $52 okay I just saw so many people
mentioning this and the best of beauty
2017 videos like multiple people
mentioned this one and I was like what
is the deal with that primer but it's
fifty two dollars for a prime it for a
primer like I just said that I will only
spend $50 on a foundation now we're
talking primers but I did mention it on
Twitter and someone has said that you
can get like a sample of it on Sephora
so I need to look into that because I
would much rather get a smaller size and
see what the deal is than just going out
and spending $52 right away cuz that's
expensive for a primer but who's tried
it don't I have another primer on my
list this is just weird
this is the Smashbox photo-finish
primaries are for $42 I believe this is
a newer product from Smashbox but again
so many people are raving about it and I
was like on the fence on the fence and
then Jessica brown orgy of beauty 89 was
chatting about it in a video the other
day and she said that she really liked
it too and I was like great that just
pushed me over the edge thank you so
much I did it to my love still is for
right when she mentioned it and said how
much she liked it I was like having dang
it done here is the first Ollie unicorn
essence mini for twenty dollars I have
the Pharsalia rose gold elixir the
full-size one and I really enjoy it I
especially use it so much in the winter
I feel like it really helps kind of help
with my dry skin and just kind of give
me a glow and I hear really good things
about the partner two of the unicorn
essence and I think I would just do the
mini though if I were to ever get it for
the $20 because I have the rose gold
elixir for over a year and I feel like
I'm gonna have it for a very long time
because you use it so you know use a
little bit at once does anyone have the
unicorn essence
I really did like a lot of people
thought that this was just like an
Instagram type thing but I actually do
really like the rose gold one so we'll
see also in here is the NARS natural
radiant long wear foundations how many
foundations do I have of my loved ones
for $49 I mentioned this one I reviewed
at the NARS foundation the other day and
like a first impression follow-up video
I did get sent some of the foundations
from NARS directly which is super cool
but none of them really are my exact
shape match so I actually do really
enjoy the foundation I'm thinking about
getting it in my shade so that's why it
is on my love's list my shade is Punjab
I believe which is in the medium
category and I got sent everything in
the light category or a couple of
foundations in the light category so I'm
still thinking about getting that one at
the $49 and then this one is a new
product this is the Becca anti-fatigue
under eye primer for 32 I mentioned this
in a recent wilayat video and was like
I'm just intrigued by it like I really
like Becca a lot of products and treat
me this one intrigues me it just came
out and right when I saw it come out
went right on the loves list apparently
my love's us a little bit longer than I
thought I really thought I could do this
before my camera over heat it but I
couldn't so back at it and I have
another primer on here what how I don't
like a year ago I don't even know if I
used your primer every time I was like
one of those things I always forgot
about but apparently now I love them
this is from Benefit Cosmetics it's the
professional pearl primer I also have
the mini on my list which is $12 it's
their new primer I'm similar to the pore
fresh pore fessional but now it's the
pearl so it's supposed to have like a
pink tinge I don't know I added it to my
list I don't know if I'll get though I
feel like there's a couple other primers
especially I feel like the Smashbox one
is like at the top of my list right now
so I hope they'll let me know what's
your favorite primer I have some
skincare on here this one this one is
from Lula Hendrickson it's the banana
bright eye cream for $38 I love Lula
hendrickson eye pretty sure I have
another item here from them I do it's
the very next one yes but the banana
bright eye cream I'm hearing really good
things already about this and a lot of
people are asking me if I've tried it
I'm like not yet but it is on my love's
list the other one from Lula Hendrickson
is the poor balance facial sauna scrub
for $28 I've just finished the mini guy
of this one that I purchased around the
vib sale I got the three glowing scrubs
kit and this was the first one that I
tried
I loved it so I do want to repurchase
the full size of another foundation on
here this is from urban decay it's the
naked skin weightless ultra definition
at liquid foundation for forty dollars I
like a lot of urban decay products like
a like a crazy amount of urban decay I
love their one and done foundation I
actually really enjoyed the all-nighter
foundation which I did not expect to
enjoy like in the slightest but I really
do like that and I hear good things
about this one and I love the concealer
of this so I'm interested in giving that
one a try and then I have the clinic
take the day off cleansing balm for 2950
it's kind of a random price um but I
hear everybody's talking about this one
and I've heard it being talked about
forever and finally the other day I was
watching some skincare video like a bus
to skincare video and this got mentioned
again I was like just how did t really
loves us so you stopped kind of
forgetting about it I feel like that's
really nice about the loves list too if
I you know there's so many products and
it's nice to put it on there and then
when I am shopping I always check over
my love so I was like okay is there
anything else that I really want to grab
from my love's list um so I have that
one on there and then the last item is
the belief moisturizing eye balm for $48
I had a mini of this guy as well that
I've just recently used up and I'm like
devastated it's our time together is
over and I really do want the full size
so it's expensive though it really is
expensive some of these items are going
to be better for the vib sale for me but
yeah the moisturizing eye balm is the
bomb
you knew that was coming I know you did
but after that that is the final item
that is currently on at my Sephora less
list okay so that is everything for
today's video and what is on my parents
sephora love's list I hope that you guys
enjoyed it seeing my loves list let me
know what you thought in the comments
down below what do you have on your
loves list and do we have anything in
common and what do you think of
everything that I mentioned like I said
I have two gift cards coming up that I
really need to finally spend I feel like
I'm that weird person like when I get
gift cards I really want to be like 100%
confident in my purchases where it's
like it's a with my own money I'm like a
you know but like a gift card like I
have this different mindset which is
really weird but I've been like hoarding
these for so long but I really need to
just go ahead and make a purchase and
maybe do a Sephora haul or something so
let me know what you thought about the
product
on there and which ones you think I
really do need to try but after that
that's gonna do it for today's video
thank you guys so much for requesting
this one and if you did enjoy it I hope
that you'll give it a thumbs up I hope
that you'll also consider subscribing

in tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
