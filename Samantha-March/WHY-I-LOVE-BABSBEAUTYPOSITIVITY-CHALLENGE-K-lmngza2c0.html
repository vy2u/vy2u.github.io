I'm really excited for today's field
because it's going to be a little bit of
a different video and it is going to be
a video for the positivity challenge
seeing a couple of these videos go
around and it's basically just youtubers
talking about I've seen people talking
about other youtubers and I've also seen
people talking about brands and just
giving a few reasons of like why we love
them why we enjoy watching them why we
buy from them and that sort of thing and
I just thought this was really really
intriguing and I wanted to be a part of
it I wanted to film something for the
positivity challenge as well and I
talked to my snapchat a little bit about
it and was you know asking if they would
be interested in seeing it feedback was
really positive and so I thought why not
do it you know there's always so much
negativity out there and I just thought
it was a really cool idea to just have a
very positive focus video out there and
especially to be talking about someone
else like i'm i'm going to choose a
youtuber to talk about in this video and
i just think it's really cool to you
know in some way let someone know like
hey what you're doing i think is really
amazing I think that's such a cool thing
I was very inspired when I started
seeing these videos come up and I just
knew that I wanted to film something for
it so that's what today's video is going
to be I love the idea behind it I
definitely challenge you guys to make a
positivity video or a blog post a social
media post or something like that and
just whatever we can do to to bring as
much positivity as we can I think is
amazing we definitely need more of it I
love the idea behind this I'm excited to
film one for myself I hope you guys
enjoy it and yeah let's let's happen to
this positivity challenge and see how
many times I can say the word positivity
so the youtuber that I decided that I
wanted to talk about in this video is
babs beauty so like I mentioned she is a
youtuber I believe her real name is
Stephanie and so I'll probably call her
Stephanie and Babs booty throughout this
video but basically i first found her on
youtube and it was just one of those
things that kind of like popped up in my
subscription box and was like oh this is
recommended for you you know
you might like her videos and I remember
looking at her thumbnail and just
thinking that girl is a real life barbie
doll I I do want to watch her videos
thank you so much and I clicked on them
and I just got sucked into her tutorials
because they are so amazing that was the
first thing that really drew me into her
and I remember the first like probably
five or so videos that I watched from
her were just straight makeup tutorials
and really like no talking she would do
like music along with her tutorials I
mean she you know it would be in the
description box there would be right on
the video but products she's using work
brushes she's using and that sort of
thing but they're really like almost
wasn't a whole lot of like talking going
on and so it was almost kind of hard to
get to know her at first but honestly
the makeup tutorials were like blowing
my mind I thought they were so amazing
that I kept watching and I kept watching
and then she started to do a few other
videos and she even said it right in her
videos and she was like I want to make
my channel more diverse I want to talk
to you guys more and that really is
another thing that drew me in was that
in my opinion I think maybe she was
taking what some people were saying like
probably what people like me were
thinking was ok your tutorials are
bombed but like we want to get to know
you too and I think she was taking that
and being like okay yes I'm getting
ideas of how to make my channel even
better i'm going to listen to him and
i'm going to do them and she does a lot
of different videos now she's done some
really cool collabs with other youtubers
that have been really amazing and i
think i started watching her channel
around like 20,000 or 30,000 subscribers
and really I feel like it was not that
long ago that i started watching her and
she now has over 200,000 subscribers and
I'm just like so happy for her because I
think she does really amazing things
another reason why I was really drawn to
her channel and to keep watching her is
because I feel like she does very
diverse looks it was one thing that
actually drew me to lustre looks as well
in the beginning when I first found her
channel was I thought her looks for
diverse but also and this goes back to
Bob's beauty as well she uses different
products and a lot of times with the
bigger youtubers you know obviously
they're getting sent like these amazing
PR packages that we see on snapchat and
stuff but everybody is using the same
thing everybody's using the same
Russia's and it was refreshing to see
Lester Lux but also Babs beauty like
using a few different products and I
felt like that really helped me because
I can't always go out and buy the newest
Urban Decay palette or the newest to
face palette and I don't get a whole
collection of lipsticks and to me so it
was interesting that she was using
different items too and that really was
something that kept drawing me back to
her especially the diver cyl looks that
she did like she was doing looks I've
never seen it other people do and she
had different techniques of the way she
did it I really love the lips that she
does she's really into like the popsicle
lips i believe it's what it's called and
she puts like a lip seen in the center
of her lips and she had glossy lips and
it's they're just so beautiful and I
just was really really attracted to her
makeup tutorials and I felt like I was
really learning from her even though she
doesn't always necessarily walk us
through the entire steps and gives us a
long like drawn-out version of a
tutorial I can still watch them and see
her technique she tells you what brushes
she's using I can see the technique
she's doing and I believe Babs beauty is
the number one youtuber that I recreate
looks from I would say it probably is
babs beauty Amanda and sing and then
Jacqueline Hill Babs beauty I think to
this day is still number one she does so
many different tutorials and I'm like
you know what I have to try that look
even if I don't have like the exact
products or even the exact shades that
she's using I still try to make my own
twist on it and use the technique that
she's doing I just think she does really
amazing makeup to also show the other
products that she's got and she talks
about these smaller companies and she's
also very honest you know like she
doesn't get everything and she's like oh
I love this oh I love this oh I loved
one oh I love that too like there's
products that she gets and she'll swatch
him and she's like oh I'm going to be
honest you guys you know that was
crumbly that's not pigmented etc etc and
she's someone who I've come to very much
trust her opinion because of that
reasoning but I just really love that
she supports other brands that she goes
out there and tries to find new makeup
products too so in addition to like
doing the different looks and trying out
different products it's the same too
like I follow her on snapchat and she is
constantly buying makeup and she says
you know I'm a makeup junkie I'm a
makeup collector like this is what I
love doing and she
from so many different brands and even
though like she's been getting more and
more PR like when she gets the exciting
packages it's so weird because I feel
like I get really excited for her to
like she's like one of my friends so I
get so happy for her thus and I just I
very much appreciate that I can tell how
much she loves makeup and she loves
beauty and it's just really exciting to
watch her journey and I can't wait to
see where it is that she goes I'm
addition to that like also with her
snapchat it's so fun getting to know
someone on a personal level like this is
why I just think social media is so
amazing because it gives us an outlet to
talk to so many more people that we
wouldn't get to without social media I
started a blog in 2009 as a way to
simply connect with other people that
have the same interest as me because I
didn't have that a lot with like my
friends and family and it was a way that
just opened up so many new friendships
for me and it's been absolutely
incredible and then now with snapchat it
truly is like getting to see a glimpse
into their real lives and seeing who
they really are and I think her husband
is fantastic and I love her dogs so much
I am such a weird like every single time
she has a snap of her dog I'm like to my
husband Im look look look look that's
the bulldog like I could so excited and
it's just really cool see that side of
her so I'm very appreciative for
snapchat for that reason another thing
too that I just really appreciate about
her is at least for me every single time
that I leave a comment on her video she
responds to me every time I've left a
comment on her Instagram she responds to
me and I think that's really amazing and
you know obviously I'm a youtuber and
I'm much smaller than she is but I can
recall the feeling that I get when she
responds to my comments like how excited
that makes me like oh my gosh she
responded to me and that's something
that I try to carry over into my channel
as well because I remember that feeling
that I get and I want to make other
people feel that way and it's just
really interesting because even like
where I am now I especially get it on
snapchat a lot every time I respond to a
snap people are like oh my gosh I can't
believe you're responding back and I'm
like well yeah I mean it's just me
remember what I feel when every single
time that I see that she replies to a
comma
of mine I remember I can make someone
feel that way too and so I just think
that's really cool and I can't believe
it because I mean like I said she has
200,000 subscribers on youtube and I
have four thousand and sometimes I can
get overwhelmed with the comments and I
know how much time it takes to like
responding to all those comments and
that she can still keep up with that is
just it's amazing again so that's about
gonna wrap it up again those are just a
few reasons why I love Babs beauty I
just I love watching her channel I think
that looks that she puts out are so
incredible i love that she's the huge
beauty lover and that she cares so much
about her channel and she cares so much
about people watching her she's
constantly talking about ways that she's
trying to improve whether it's her
beauty room or her back her on our
camera or her lighting or the looks in
general or her techniques are mixing
things up and I just I appreciate it so
much I love her style I love the looks
that she does I love her connection that
she has with her followers I just think
it's really cool I just wanted to take a
moment here to give my thanks to her
because she's seriously a very very big
inspiration of mine I love watching her
videos I love being able to recreate her
looks even though some of them can be
super dramatic she just has a way of
breaking them down and showing them that
makes me a makeup beginner think hey I
can do that too and I just appreciate
that so much I'm constantly recommending
her to people when people ask me who are
my favorite youtubers to watch or who
should i look to for makeup tutorials
one of the number one youtubers that I
throw out there I just I love her
channel so much I'm sure you guys have
heard of her as well but if you haven't
I will link her YouTube and her
Instagram down below I hope that you
will check her out if you have not heard
of her yet you should because she is
pretty freaking amazing i was really
excited that i was able to make this
video and take part in this positivity

think it's very special and I think more

an amazing message to have so thank you
