that link down below as well time i go
ahead and jump into this week's will i
buy it so this was a comment from last
week so will i buy a video someone asked
if i would talk about the new laura
geller highlighter it was funny because
she said I know that you're on and he'll
buy right now with highlighters but can
you please talk about this highlight and
I said okay I'm but talk about it so
from laura geller beauty they released
the diamond dust baked gelato swirl
illuminator i'm looking on the train
mood instagram it says that it's sold
out for right now but it's going to be
restocked and it'll be available in june
at ulta beauty and other stores and it's
not stack i'm not sure what the prices
i'll have it listed down below if i can
figure out what the prices i said like i
mentioned i'm on a no x 4 highlighters
right now because I just have been
buying too many highlights it's truly
not something that I wear every day you
only need a little bit of highlight and
then it goes a long way like I just I
have too many highlights right now I
need to back off the highlight train it
was like all of a sudden once every
single makeup brand is coming out with
highlights it was like pure insanity I
feel like it's still going on like
people are still coming out highlights
really what in the heck is happening I
just don't need any right now it looks
really cool at all of course a picture
will be inserted it's like like like a
holographic almost type of highlight it
looks
really cool I've never tried any of the
Laura Geller highlighters I remember
deals it honey that was a really like
everybody was on the gilded honey train
for a while but i never did it i want to
say that highlights are like twenty-six
dollars i remember being at alta and
seeing it i was like twenty six dollars
for one highlighter like oh i just i
don't think i can do it so i think the
single highlighters are a little bit
more pricey and that's why I've never
jumped on them I would love to know if
you guys have tried to laura geller
highlighters you love them do you have
the guild it honey do you love it are
you going to pick up with this diamond
just one what are your thoughts on it
again it looks super cool skirt huge
highlight first and this would probably
be a really fun one to have in your
collection but I know that I just do not
need at this time that I was tied on
Instagram for this and it kind of made
me chuckles I think there was like a
funny smiley face behind it and I was
like I get what you're doing girl I get
it so make up forever just released some
new bra products so they release a brow
liner which is a liquid bra liner to
fill in and define the brows thats in
five different shades its twenty three
dollars each release a brow gel to
naturally fill groom and strengthen brow
Harrison five different shades and its
twenty dollars each and they also have
brow pencils which shades to fines and
shape sprouts in five different shades
they are twenty dollars each now if you
guys don't know I'm not a brow person
like a look at my brows right now I'm
not a bra person I don't do the
Instagram brow I don't do i've never
used pomades on my brows I don't use
concealer to cut my brows I don't do any
of that because it's just not what I'm
into it's not my style I don't think I'm
good at doing it so I I'm more
uncomfortable when I really try to like
go after my brows I think I look strange
and I am just not comfortable doing it a
lot of times I use something like the
gimme brow from benefit or the
Maybelline master precise those are both
like fiber gel for eyebrows and it just
kind of gives you a little oomph and
like cleans them up a little bit
sometimes I use a goof proof pencil from
benefit but I just I don't do my brows a
lot I'm not a brown person and I know
like I still get comments from people
like do something with your brows and
I'd like to do something with your life
being said I don't actually have a lot
from make up forever i don't know if i
have anything from Makeup Forever
actually I don't think I do it's just a
brand that I guess I've never
like gone for so i don't know i don't i
don't really have much from them i know
you can get them at sephora they're more
of a high end makeup line so the brow
liner that just sounds like a complete
disaster to me I cannot imagine myself
using a brow liner I just I imagine like
horribly box square eyebrows no that's
not going to work for me so with the
brow gel it says that it strengthens the
brow hairs so I don't really know is it
it doesn't say it's a fiber so I don't
really know what that is but I don't
need it I have a clear brow gel and I
also have the Ready Set brow from
benefit which is another clear brow gel
and I like it just fine and like I said
I don't do my brows every day so I don't
use that every day so I just wouldn't
need it and then they have some brow
pencils again I have the goose proof
pencil and I'm actually i'm going to buy
precisely my brows and benefit I hear a
lot of people say really good things
about it i think if i want to try to and
see how it compares to the goof proof i
can kind of give my thoughts on the
comparison between the two for people
who like don't arouse a lot or beginner
with browse I thought maybe I could test
out those two and kind of give my
feedback for a future review so i don't
think i'd get a lot of good use out of
them to be honest i'm going to pass over
this new brow collection from make up
forever it's just we're just not a good
fit you know we just don't we're just
not compatible with each other you know
but i'd love to know are you guys going
to get it are you guys huge brow fans
you have all these brow pencils and
pomades enough to know if you guys need
to get your hands on this makeup forever
collection I've been getting asked a lot
of questions on this next one so
youtuber desi Perkins has teamed up with
key Australia again to put out some
sunglasses I think it was last year it
does he teamed up with key Australia and
came out with three different styles of
sunglasses she is not coming back and
releasing new styles so she is coming
out with the Sahara collection it looks
to be the same style of sunglass but in
like three different colors there's out
of orange theta and yellow they'll be
available April sir so there should be
already on sale there's sixty dollars
each they'll be available on the key
Australia website so if it's still in
stock i'll leave it links down below I
think
he is also sold at like other retailers
so what do I think about these
sunglasses um let me say that I love
desi Perkins i watch all of our videos i
watch from snapchat I love desi I feel
like I'm part of her family I love her
dogs I really enjoyed it that being said
I do not like these sunglasses at all so
I do not like this style of glasses and
I don't know I understand that they are
super on trend right now I understand
that trend I understand that it is a
trend I don't understand the trend I
don't really know for sure when dislike
oversized lens-style started coming out
but I was seeing a couple influencers
wearing glasses like these and 90 min
sunglasses like regular glasses and I'm
like you look like my stepfather in the
early 90s like that is the type of
actual glasses on he wore I'm like why
are you guys wearing glasses like that
that looks kind of strange right is it
just me and then everybody started
wearing them and I was like okay it's
just me it's just me that does not like
this trend and more and more people are
wearing them and then when I saw that
desi was covered out with glasses like
these I was like I'm doing something
wrong these sunglasses are not for me
though they legitimately remind me of my
stepfather in like nineteen ninety-two
these are the glasses that you are I
don't find them flattering I don't know
if you love them and you can pull them
off I kudos to you I know that I would
not be able to pull these off and it's
not a trend for me so I'm just going to
say that also what I will say is that I
don't know if I really ever want to
purchase from key Australia again I had
heard really good things about key see
you telling people wearing key you see
celebrities wearing key sunglasses so
when desi like I was planning on
purchasing a pair from P Australia
hadn't done it yet and desi says she's
going to do a collabo I'm like okay I'm
gonna buy them so i purchased the Heike
i think it was the oversized aviators in
gold and they did not lift it on my face
is way too narrow for the oversized
aviator so ended up
going to give away I also ordered the on
the low sunglasses I think they were on
the load they were like the big black
sunglasses I got him and I loved him
like yeah they were oversized but was
how like six of frames were I just felt
like it worked I felt like a boss babe
when I wore those sunglasses I
absolutely loved them I wore them for I
think it was two months two months k
never dropped them never saru them in my
purse i babied these sunglasses they
came in this case they stayed in this
case babied these sunglasses sunglasses
here are the rest of the sunglasses two
months sixty dollars are you kidding me
can you see that that is insane and at
first it was just one and I was like
okay I'm topping this back in so I was
like no I love to see sunglasses like
how is this happening I I treated them
with the most respect that I've ever
treated sunglasses of how could this be
happening so I kept popping it back in
and then the other side broke too and
I'm like forget it just forget it I'm
done I was going to throw these away and
I don't know why I keep hanging on to
them but now I can make this video and
show you guys I I don't know if I can
ever purchase from key again because
sixty dollars to get two months of wear
out of something and I get it I would
have dropped these stepped on them you
know haphazardly threw them in my person
and through a heavy wallet on top of it
i get it and i totally would have reebok
the sunglasses actually depressed that I
no longer have these sunglasses because
I loved them but I can't spend sixty
dollars and have that happen again
that's ridiculous these are like my
normal sunglasses that I always wear
these were nine dollars at target I've
had him for five years 55 years I have
to wrap seed i have sat on these these
have been haphazardly thrown in my purse
with a wallet thrown on top of them they
are completely fine five years nine
dollars I feel like I only see good
things about Keith sunglasses and
everybody always wearing them and
talking them up and I don't know what I
did wrong and I'm sorry I don't mean to
go on a ramp it like
that was that was really really very
upsetting to me that that happened so
I'm not going to be purchasing the new
it desi and key sunglasses huge
congratulations to desi's like that's
super amazing that she gets a collab
again I know she's coming out with a new
shade in the high keys the silver will
be releasing some time as well but the
Sahara sundays are coming out April
thurs like i said i'll link them down
below there's sixty dollars hope that
you guys are all having better successes
what's the key Sundays and I am so I
just really don't the Sahara Sonny's
style wines are just not for me anyway
so I wouldn't purchase them regardless
even if I had a great experience with
key Australia I wouldn't purchase them
because they're just not for me and I
can't get into the trend so I'm going to
be passing over the new at dezzy Sonny's
please really do let me know in the
comments down below I'd love to know
your experience with key Australia like
it might really the only one who is fun
glasses have broke within two months on
her for no reason I I would love to know
your guys's experience with key
Australia and also adds up to know of
course if you are getting the Sahara
Sonny's that is no and then the last
item that I'm going to talk about for
this week's will i buy a video is
probably the most requested then has
come in it is the new AG locate from
anastacio Beverly Hills so honest idea
is coming out with a new bloke it it is
called Aurora it will be forty dollars
it will also be permanent it's going to
release on April fourth which was
yesterday on the anastagio website says
around June it'll be a sephora ulta
beauty macy's dillard's and more so this
one it looks pretty comparative to the
moon child glow kit i'll have the photo
of the over or down here but just
packaging why setup wise layout wise it
looks pretty similar to the moon child
and i know a lot of people really did
like the moon child the shades and there
are pretty unique and interesting and
almost more of like the holographic type
of highlight i would say so that's kind
of what the aurora is reminding me up
i'm looking at some swatches right now
and you know I I did say earlier that I
don't need to buy any highlights because
i do have so many highlights right now
but i definitely don't need to add any
more
he wants to my collection i also just
purchased the glow kits that Anasazi
released in collaboration with youtuber
Nicole Guerrero so I do have that glow
kit and i did a video about the glow kit
i will leave it link down below that was
the fifth glow kid i received in a row
Fisk locusts that came shattered so I
send it on my snapchat that I really
don't think i'm going to buy any more
glow kids from anastacio because for
whatever reason they can't get to me in
one piece I don't know what it is and I
know a lot of people got the Nicole
bloke it shattered and the other globe
can I was having a lot of comments with
was the sweet school kid I know a lot of
people were getting that shattered as
well so it wasn't like it was just me it
was happening to a lot of people but
still it's really frustrating to spend
forty dollars on a product and then you
get it and then it's broken and you're
like well no what am I supposed to do so
I set it on my snapchat that I really
don't plan on purchasing a glow kid at
least in the near future especially a
fact order online I just I don't want to
do it because it's pallid it's going to
be a waste of money because I can't get
to me not broken but of course that
being said I just have so many
highlights right now I don't feel like I
need this I'm kind of surprised because
they came out with another glow kit so
fast after than a cold Guerrero like
when I saw the news that the aurora was
coming out i'm like really why like what
why do you need to release another bloke
it right now that's insane to me like
please anastacio don't turn into color
pop wherever two weeks you come out I
like I refused to put color pop in this
video there is two more color pop
questions that I could have talked about
and I'm like I am NOT putting color pop
in another will i buy a video I feel
like I talk about them every single week
because they read these so much stuff so
I don't know the timing the timing was a
little bit strange to me on this glow
can't but again the colors they look
unique like if these are the highlights
that you really want and you're really
attracted to them I don't think forty
dollars is a bad price for AG locate
you're getting six shade and needed that
there's some very intriguing colors in
here though like the blues and my god
yellow and there I mean and the pink
actually like the blue kind
reminded me of one of the shades in the
da'kel Guerrero like some of the shades
in here seem similar to the Nicole globe
and so I guess that's why I'm even more
confused i just feel like there's
definite similarities between the two so
to release them basically like back it
back I'm like okay you know I don't need
to get it and I do not want to order
another glow kit pass over at the Aurora
glow kit if it is still in stock by the
time i have this video up I will have it
linked down below but it should be
available out of April fourth I'm not a
necessity website forty dollars for the
six shades let us know in the comments
down below are you planning on picking
up Aurora where you super excited when
you saw it come out did you get to
Nicole glow but you still want the
Aurora I would love to know let us know
in the comments all right answers going
to be everything for this week's will i
