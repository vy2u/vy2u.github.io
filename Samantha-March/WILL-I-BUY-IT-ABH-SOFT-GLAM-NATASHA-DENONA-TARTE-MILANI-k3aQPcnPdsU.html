today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post novella boy at videos
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about some new makeup releases
and launches letting you know a little
bit about them and then also chatting
over if I'm going to pick them up or
pass over them I know I say every single
week that I have so much to talk about
but this week was on another level so we
need to get started alright like I was
saying I don't know what the heck
happened this week but so many things
got announced released and my poor
Instagram could barely keep up with the
tags that were coming in it was so hard
to narrow down the items for this week's
Lily buy a video cuz a lot happened
first up I really do want to talk about
these eyeshadow palettes from Milani I
got so many tags on these Milani is
coming out with new eyeshadow palettes I
have two new ones I got a lot of tags
from people saying can you believe this
is Milania Milania is a drugstore brand
but these new palettes that they came
out what they really look like a step
above from what Milani has shown us in
the past with their eyeshadow palette so
a lot of people seem to really hyped
over these so there's two new eyeshadow
palettes they are both $20 each there is
a most love math I shadow pellet and
then also be bold obsessions eyeshadow
palette so I have both a link down below
truly I am more of a matte shadow lover
but I will say that my eyes a first went
to the bold obsessions eyeshadow palette
which looks have a mixture of matte
shimmers I just feel like there's a
little bit more diversity in that
palette I've been talking about lately
how kind of palettes that are too
monochromatic are just like not doing it
for me these days and so I wanted
something with a little bit a little bit
more to it so I'm going to on the Milani
website right now on my phone so I'm
gonna click on the bold obsessions
eyeshadow palette so does come with a
mirror which i think is fantastic
and like I said I mean these just look
these just look like something different
from Milani which is really exciting I
think it's really cool I'm just see this
so again it's 20 dollars right now
they're only available at the Milani
whomps website from what I see Milani is
now also at Ulta I checked the online
website and I didn't see it yet but I
believe I saw online that they are
coming to Ulta so I am pretty curious to
try these I've never tried a Milani
eyeshadow palette myself I did get a
couple
single shadows
and from my mom once actually I asked
for them because I was seeing so many
people I'll talk about them in YouTube
videos so my mom sent me a few of those
and I really did like them I thought
that they are a really nice quality but
I never rotated towards the palace so I
kind of really do want to try this one
and see if it is worth it um how many
different shades are in here three six
nine twelve so there's twelve different
shades $20 you get the mirror you know
it is drugstore and it is affordable so
I don't know $20 I feel like you're kind
of getting on the higher price point for
drugstore for more I don't even know if
I should say for Milani because Milani
is not a brand that I tried a ton of so
I'm not a hundred percent on that but
what do you guys think about the price
do you think $20 is good do you think
it's in the affordable realm do you
think it's getting up there guys have
the bold obsessions is the one that I am
more gravitating towards but I think
when this comes in to Ulta I kind of do
want to grab it and I really want to try
it out and see and see how it is like I
said I've never tried Milani eyeshadow
palette so I am curious and this one
definitely caught my attention I know a
lot of people seemed really excited over
these so I want to know what you think
of these Milani eyeshadow palettes are
you interested in both or one of the
other do you have to have it right away
like have you guys already ordered it
from the Milani website are you like me
and you prefer until they wait to come
into Ulta for you know the rewards and
the points and all of that I'm super
guilty of doing that but that just is
what it is but yeah I'm really
interested in these ones from Milani
when I first saw them I thought honey
know why it looks like fences so I think
that's really cool and I'm definitely
interested in these ones so my phone
just started blowing up when tarte
finally announced that they are coming
out with the shape tape foundation I
feel like we've been kind of hearing
this for a while like we think they're
putting out a shape tape foundation are
they putting out a shape tape foundation
win is the shape Day Foundation coming
and I can't even remember what night it
was but it finally did get announced it
all of a sudden not only was my
Instagram going off my snapchat was
going off I was like what's happening
what's happening right now sometimes it
kind of scares me when all the time I
see so many snaps coming in at one time
but all I can think is like oh gosh what
happened and it was because the shape
tape is a it's here it's here I thought
I mean it's already here like they
announced it and then it was here
within like three days or something it
was crazy and this is pretty interesting
because they actually have two different
formulas which I don't know I don't feel
like I see a ton of them now I'm looking
at my my foundation collection I mean
we've seen it before like especially I'm
thinking of like the Loreal Pro glow the
Loreal Pro matte things like that but
with the Tarte shaped a Pathan
foundation you're getting you can choose
between the matte foundation it says
it's full coverage smooths over pores
and imperfections with rich airbrushed
full coverage that dries to a flawless
matte finish using a unique a concealer
inspired wand it says the formula
absorbs oil and shine and lives leaves a
scan at creaseless and hydrated which is
weird because it's matte but okay and
then we have I'm reading off the turn
mood one Instagram so I'll have a link
down below like a normal eye do we also
have the hydrating one and it says it
provides the same rich creamy full
coverage as a shaped tape contour
concealer in a skin at smoothing
weightless gel the collagen and
hyaluronic acid pact formula is like a
drink of h2o for your skin continuously
hydrating while helping to plump skin
and refined pores for 12 hours without
creasing or cakey
oh my goodness okay so they also
released a couple other things like a
foundation brush a contouring sponge and
an eye primer I'm just gonna talk about
the foundation because that's what
everybody was asking me about so it says
that it'll be available January 21st
online at Ulta beauty and then February
4th in stores it is available though
already on the tarte cosmetics website
so I will have that linked down below I
am super excited about this because I've
been wanting a shave tape foundation for
so long I definitely am someone who
loves the shape tape concealer I've
basically used up my entire bottle and
I've been wanting to repurchase a new
one the price on it is $39 which I don't
think is a bad price I typically will
spend like up to the $50 mark when it
comes to foundation so $39 I was pretty
happy to see that price I know that I
already liked her foundations I have the
rainforest of the sea foundation on
today and like I said I'm just super
curious to try out this foundation I
know this has been like requested so
many people have been hoping for a shape
tape foundation so when I finally saw it
I was like yes can't wait to try this
one I love foundations of such a huge
like foundation junkie of this moment in
time so I'm really excited about this I
think the two different the
Matt and the hydrating I think that's
really interesting and I think that's
really cool so you can kind of narrow it
down to your skin needs for me myself
personally I am planning on trying out
the hydrating foundation especially
right now I'm just super dry because of
its like negative two degrees outside
right now or something I'm looking at a
ton of snow this video is probably very
bright but I would definitely try the
hydrating but that's just kind of what I
lean towards anyways even in the summer
I like leaning towards hydrating or dewy
or you know things like that I very
rarely go for like an all matte type of
look so I'm definitely interested in the
hydrating foundation I think I will wait
though until it comes into an Ulta again
I don't mind purchasing from the Tarte
website but I know they had some
security issues not that long ago which
kind of scared me off from purchasing
from them they do have a nice reward
system over there as well back and I
just think altas is better and while
this is something that I am really
excited for and I do want to purchase it
I can still wait the you know extra week
or whatever it is until it comes in to
Ulta I've been one of those that have
been hoping that the shape tape
foundation was coming so I'm excited to
see that it's here but what do you guys
think are you planning on trying the
shape tape foundation are you waiting
for it which one are you thinking that
you'll get the hydrating or the matte
you like there's two different finishes
I would love to know any of your
thoughts down below as well but yes I am
also interested in the shape tape
foundation yeah racking them up and this
will live a video that's fantastic I was
getting us o many tags on this new one
from Natasha Danone I'm like Oh Natasha
what are we doing here so we got a
diamond and blush face highlighting and
contouring shadow Noda she's coming out
with two different ones there is one in
citrus and then there is also the one in
let me click the other one I'm on the
Sephora app right now
the other one is Dhara Darya I'm sure
I'm saying that incorrectly so it's $89
so from the sephora app it says this is
a cheek palette created with a diamond
like sparkle based onon Tasha's idea of
a new generation of glow use it to play
and achieve a wide range of finishes and
looks from natural to extreme you can
create a duo chrome or a dime
hello the pilot also includes a new
cream blush as well as Natasha's classic
powder blush brush blush you know same
thing okay so between the two let me let
me pick which one I feel like I would go
for feel like between the two I would
look at the Daria because obviously I
tend to gravitate towards the ones that
I can't pronounce I do it with
foundation I do palates it just is that
what it is hang up this one it has a
glow cream a diamond powder cream blush
powder blush duo chrome highlighter and
the extreme glow man you know what I
think this looks beautiful do I want it
yeah hello I did a double-take I've been
wanting to try Natasha Jinan of products
for like ever I hear really good things
about them she also has another palette
similar to this I think it's more of
like a contour bronzer palette I want to
say I hear really good things I heard a
lot of great things mentioned about like
a single highlight that she has I saw
that mentioned in 2017 bested Beauty
videos so when I saw this I was like
that's pretty and then I saw $89 and I
was like ah Natasha I get doing it again
the time should have known it I mean one
of the biggest reasons why I haven't
purchased a ton from the brain that's
just because it's really expensive and
it is it's it's it's hard to break it
down it's hard to justify and I know
people do it and people you know they
will leave me the comments breaking it
all down and saying well when you break
it all down it really equals to this I'm
like I know but at one time that's a lot
of money it is already available online
I'm sure it's available in etosha de
Nonna I'm looking at the Sephora app
it's available at Sephora it is
available on beauty lush as well and it
says it'll be in all stores on January
26 so even though I really want this one
and I would love to try it and face
palettes are just some of my I just I
love going into face palettes I just did
a video all about my favorite face
palettes I love when I can go in and get
a mixture a variety of different
products but I think that $89 is just
gonna be too expensive for me I really
think it is I'm I'm thinking over my
face palettes that I mentioned and I'm
pretty sure the most expensive face
palette I mentioned was that one
Kevin Taquan and that was $65 so I just
think 89 is gonna be out of my price
range which really bums me out I do have
some Sephora gift cards hanging about
and I actually have I know another one
is on its way to me so I have a bunch of
Sephora gift cards but I still don't
know it's like do I want to spend the
gift card money on something that is so
high priced or do I want to spend it on
items that I've been wanting for a
really long time and I've been saving up
for and I've been on my loveless forever
I just what do you guys think I think
the 89 is just going to be too crazy for
me it looks beautiful I love the
packaging I feel like the colors inside
I would gravitate towards a ton but I
don't think I can do it I would love to
know where you guys so excited about
this one have you already ordered it one
thing that I tried to do in my mind to
like break it down when I saw this one I
was like okay you are getting six
different shades but it really is just
highlights and just blushes like even if
I think maybe if there would have been
like a contour or bronzer in there like
maybe I could have like started to
justify if there was just something else
like I know there's different finishes I
don't use cream blushes a lot though so
that was one thing too that kind of like
niggled at me like how often are you
really going to use because there's the
glow cream and then also the cream blush
I just don't reach for the cream
products a lot so I don't know if I
would go for those a ton so if I take
two out now we're talking four shades
for $89 so I just don't think I'm gonna
do it but let us know what you think are
you super hyped about this one I'm gonna
try to stay strong and say no and then
the last item that I'm gonna talk about
is of course the new Anasazi Beverly
Hills a shadow palette whoo my Instagram
I'm like seriously was like what is
happening what's happening with all
these tags man okay okay so we got a new
eyeshadow palette from Anastasia it is
called the soft glam palette it looks
very similar to a mana Renaissance
subculture all of that has the mirror
has the brush I don't see a price on it
I'm gonna go ahead and guess $42 because
that's what the other pellets are and it
says that it is coming sometime in March
I so inside is is the shades that I am
vibing on right now
have to say these pinks in there and it
looks like to be some gold these are
like my type of shades right now I'm so
into it as I'm wearing a blue eye shadow
today but these are my type of shades
right now so this one caught my
attention immediately
I passed over the the prism palette so I
feel like I feel like I'm very
interested in soft glam and I think that
I'm going to get it I really really hope
that this one is more similar to the
modern Renaissance I really hope that
the formula is more modern Renaissance
than subculture I'm someone who likes
the subculture but I definitely prefer
the formula in a modern renaissance so
this one is just mmm
digging this one so yeah I know that
there are a couple repeats shades in
here I think let's see Cyprus amber was
in modern renaissance burnt orange is in
modern Renaissance
I'm pretty sure and then tempura is also
in the modern renaissance interested in
the pinky tones the dusty rose shade
looks really beautiful as well so this
is just like my personal taste for
eyeshadow palettes especially right now
I keep saying in multiple videos and I'm
really into pink looks pink eye shadow
pink lipstick completely opposite of
what I'm doing today but that is what I
meant really into right now so yeah I'm
super interested in this one I'm excited
for this release and yeah I think I'm
just gonna go ahead and I have this one
on the wish list as well this was this
was a big big week for the will I buy a
video but I would love to know did you
see this one and you're like yes or did
you see this one you're like nuts not my
type of tones at all or I've already
purchased like the last how many
eyeshadow palettes anasazi is putting
out I don't need this one but for me I
feel like I definitely want it to give
this one a go and see what it's like so
