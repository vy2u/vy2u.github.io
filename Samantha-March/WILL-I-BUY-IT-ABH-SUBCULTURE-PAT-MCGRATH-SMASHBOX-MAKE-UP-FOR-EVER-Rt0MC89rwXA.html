today's video is going to see a new will
i buy it i post my valiant videos every
single Wednesday where I'm talking about
some new makeup releases and launches
and letting you know what I think about
them a little bit about them and if I'm
going to picking them up or passing over
them like I said I do postings every
single Wednesday so I will have my will
I buy at playlist link down below in
case you want to check out any of my
past videos right now I am also posting
every single day so if you like getting
a daily content on makeup of beauty I
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button my 20 kg avoid for both
YouTube and Instagram are ending very
shortly so if you haven't yet gotten
entered I'll have them linked down below
as well and make sure that you get
entered in them but I also want to talk
about in my will advice videos so now if
I go ahead and get started so first up I
was getting a couple tags on some new
items from Make Up For Ever they're
coming out with their artist base colour
and personalised palette now you can buy
different single pans of these and put
them in their own little pan so they
have 34 different highlight sculpting
and blush shades there's three different
finishes or smashing myrrh and pearl and
you can buy the mono palette or one for
$25 a dual palette for $35 or a trio
palette for $45 so you get a little
palette and then you can fill them with
a different amount of shades in there I
find that very interesting because you
can definitely personalize these to what
you want and I thought it was an
interesting concept because so many
times when we buy Palace you know you're
like oh I love this one shade in here
are these two out of three shades Berg
for me but this last one is too dark
it's too light I don't like the finish
to it etc etc so now you can go ahead
and you know personalize your palette I
thought that was super interesting so
they are available right now on the
website they've came available July 21st
as those will be available to like 26
online at Sephora and August 4th in
stores I'm reading from the train would
website like I normally do in my will i
bias videos so I'll have her page listed
down below I'll try to include a photo
in here as well as you can see some of
the different finishes and colors and
shades range that they have I was
super intrigued when I saw this like
like it immediately caught my eye
because I'm all about that
personalization sometimes it just drives
me crazy getting a palette buying a
palette and
shades don't work for you it just is
kind of a bummer so to be able to
personalize I'm so super into back I
thought right away I did a double-take
and I thought right away like yes I'm
totally gonna buy this I want to have it
I think that's really cool and then I
thought well wait a second I really want
to purchase one of the new Anasazi
Beverly Hills blush trios I talked about
that in a previous bill I buy a video I
said I wanted to buy it I still have my
eye on it and I still planning to buy it
so I went like up the prices anastacio
and for three blush shades and there is
$30 I thought okay so why would I spend
$45 on the makeup forever
versus the $30 on the anastacio you know
like I should probably both I'm Sofia I
wasn't able to compare the weights in my
grams of the makeup which honestly I
don't know sometimes I'm into that
sometimes I'm not because it's so hard
to go through makeup anyways I'm just
kind of like I don't know I know a lot
of people are really into that like your
value and like price program and stuff
but like I don't like mask so no no I
don't want to do that but I wasn't
really able to tell like from the
Anastacio on but also web site it just
said it was like point 11 ounces or
something of product and where's the
make up for ever it was like pearls of
different pants so I'm really not sure
on that if anybody has done the map and
you want to share it you can leave it in
the comments down below but I didn't but
so I thought why would I do that why
would I spend an extra fifteen dollars
on this and then I thought well because
you're going to personalize the shades
because as I was going through the
anasazi of blush trios and trying to
pick out which one I want there's like
one shade from you know three to four
different palettes and I'm like oh I
wish the shade was over here and I wish
the shade wasn't this one but I don't
like to finish it that one but I like
these other two blushes you know I'm
saying and those are all blushes where
is this one with the makeup forever you
have highlight sculpting and blushed
shades so I think I'm actually going to
go with the makeup forever
versus the anastasiya because I think it
just makes more sense yes it is more
expensive and I totally get that but you
also get to customize it so you will
know that you would want all three of
those shades I think it's super cool I'm
into this I think that's really neat I'm
down with this idea it seems like you
know because I'm
you buy make up and you think it was a
waste because I'm voicing this one shade
and with this one it's not so I know
it's more expensive when I compare it to
a new release from anastacio but the
personalization factor is really getting
me and I think that I am going to buy it
I'm going to wait till it comes
available in Sephora which is July 26 so
by the time this video is up hopefully I
will have been able to make a purchase
but I definitely have my eye on bees I
really want to try them out I think it
would be super cool I don't have a ton
from makeup forever but I do like the
brand some of the items have caught my
eye but this one like really caught my
eye I did a hard double take on this
just never going to plan to get this if
you want just the one shape the two
shapes of three shapes you have blushes
sculpting powders like let us know
because this one actually got me pretty
stoked so next up is a product from
Smashbox cosmetics it's their studio
skin shaping a foundation stick on one
side you have a stick Foundation and on
the other side you have a soft contour
stick super super curious about these
you guys so says they are in 60
different shades and there's a full-size
foundation on one end and then the
complimentary soft contour on the other
they are 42 dollars available to
Smashbox website and they're also
available online at the for us we'll
have any links and information down
below like I normally do including like
any makeup that I'm wearing I always
have that all listed down below again
double tape these will advice slightly I
swear I like killing me like the makeup
brand I but I feel like they're coming
out with such innovative things right
now a lot of them instead of seeing the
same thing and the same trend and the
same product over and over and over
again I feel like we're getting more
innovative products coming out it's just
like really exciting me I've been really
enjoying the stick foundations lately
I've been buying more and more of them
and I'm a huge cream contouring fan I
cream contour almost every single day
and I just really enjoyed cream
contouring so to get a thick foundation
and a cream contour in one unlike do I
gotta have it or do I gotta have it I
have a feeling the Sephora haul is
coming up in my near future and there's
just so many things that I'm excited
about right now $42 at first I was like
$42 it's expensive I'm trying to
remember that you get the two different
products in one so that maybe it's not
such a bad deal but again it
it made me do that hard double take it
the only thing that I feel like I would
be concerned about was getting the shade
matching correctly like getting your
right foundation shade and then you're
right contour shade I mean I haven't
really done a lot of in-depth research
on the different shades but obviously
you hope that from a foundation shade
that there's going to be a complementary
contour shade of course but that's
really the only thing that I'm like ooh
what they work out okay but other than
that I'm going to do some research into
the shades but I have to say that this
excited me a lot is lost think it's a
really cool spin on a stick foundation I
also think it's a really cool spin I've
seen some like contour and concealer
shades in one I have one from NYX I also
have one from Pierre the Cameo contour
plus the concealer at one in and then it
stick like cream contour on the other
end I've never seen a foundation and
contour and I just feel like this is
totally my jam so I'm really into it I
really like Smashbox cosmetics I have
quite a bit from them so I think that
I'm going to get this one too so I'm
just really excited about it but let us
know your thoughts down below what do
you think about the stick and cream
contour in one did it make you double
take like it did me because I'm pretty
excited about this one too from Smashbox
cosmetics so a lot of you guys know that
I may look like lover I'm a lipstick
addict I got a ton of questions on the
new lipsticks from Pat McGrath so these
are the left
matte trance lipsticks luxurious a
richly pigmented formulation with a
lightweight veil of a rich color the
singles are going to be $38 or there are
specific trios available as well before
95 for the 3 they are available now or
you can also apparently get the
everything kit for $275 looks like it is
available right now at Pat McGrath and
then it's going to be available at
Sephora on July 29th so I will have any
link down below and that information
down below as well I did see
nikkietutorials I made a video about
these lipsticks I think she's done some
work with Pat McGrath on path which is
really cool time aggress is such a huge
name and and I know that and you know a
lot of people are excited about these
lipsticks but I don't think I'm going to
be able to do it and for a second there
I feel like I almost had myself talked
into them but I really didn't even do a
double-take I was curious about the
lipsticks I know Pavan
and you know her past makeup items have
gotten a ton of hype and I totally
understand that send such a lipstick
person I thought well surely you would
want to have this $38 for one lipstick
is definitely a very large price tag
more than I'm usually comfortable than
paying for a lipstick so I did have to
think about that I know that's what a
lot of you all said to when I was
getting the text about the Pat McGrath
lip space a lot of you were saying I'm
really interested but the price is
holding me back I get it
that's very expensive for a lipstick and
most definitely is and I just I just
don't think I'm going to do it it seems
silly to me honestly sivaiah lipstick
especially at that price with the amount
of lipsticks that I've gotten recently
like I said I'm a lipstick ad I get so
hard for me to walk into a CVS and only
go in there for what I'm intending to
buy and not walk out with a lipstick
it's hard for me not to get excited when
I see new lipsticks on Sephora and I
want to purchase them but I have gotten
a lot of lipsticks specific packages
lately I have a huge giveaway going on
right now with a bunch of NYX lipstick I
have one that will be coming up with Mac
I got a huge package from Matt got a big
ol package from Avon as well like it
just would be so silly to me honestly to
buy a lipstick at $38 knowing how many
lipsticks I have sitting in my office
behind me that I want to be trying out
and that I want to see what the formulas
like and see what the color is like and
you know and then I have all of my
favorites and my writer dies and my Holy
Grail lipsticks that I continually want
to use as well it just it just seems
silly to me and I really do want to keep
that in mind that so I'm going to pass
over the Pat McGrath lipsticks I
understand the hype is very real and I
understand a lot of people are going to
be buying these lipsticks I'm just not
going to do it a it just didn't make me
do the double take and be I just don't
need them and see the price is just too
high even if for some reason I'd
convinced myself that I did need a new
lipstick the price is really really high
so for those three reasons I want to
pass over the new Pat McGrath lipsticks
but again I know a lot of people were
excited about it so let us know your
thoughts on these and if you plan on
picking one up but I'm going to say no
say no to lipsticks I am so excited to
talk about the final product because I'm
going to be doing some breaking news
here breaking news you guys do not know
about this new release and I'm so
excited to be the first one to tell you
that I'm saw a Beverly Hills is coming
out with a new eyeshadow palette I know
I know
I know I'm going breaking the news to
you I know no one is known know in Sag
to me on this but it's true
honestly Beverly Hills is coming out
with a new eyeshadow palette in the
subculture I'll obviously just kidding I
got so many pegs on this and that I had
to put in last week's Villa by a video I
put a comment in there and pinned it to
the top it was like I know I promise I
will talk about it next week I promise
because I knew the palette was coming
there was that weird leech thing that
happens I was really unfortunate I'm not
really sure what happened there but I
knew the eyeshadow palette was coming
but I hadn't actually seen the inside of
it yet I hadn't seen any of the colors
yet so I couldn't really talk about it
yet and I think it was last Wednesday
morning like as I was cleaning the
lullaby at live the pictures started
coming in and people are like why is it
not in your will I buy it like just so
you guys know I'm filming this video on
a Sunday it takes me a lot of time to
film and edit and upload and get
everything ready
especially with posting a video every
single day but I typically am filming a
couple days in advance so I hadn't known
about the palette yet when I was filming
for last weeks ago I buy a video but I
promise I put it in this ones I know you
guys are so excited so the eyeshadow
palettes are so see more on the dark and
sexy type side that be available July
25th on the anasazi website and then
August 1st online at Sephora Dillard's
and Macy's uLTA Beauty and then August
15th in stores we don't have a price yet
from what I could tell but what the
modern renaissance was in the $40 range
$42 I want to say somewhere around there
so I expect it to be around that same
price it does look like it comes with
the double-ended brush as well and I
believe it would probably have a mirror
and there too just like the modern
renaissance so super excited about this
obviously the hype is so so real I mean
the amount of tags on all of my social
media channels which is so crazy a lot
of people are very excited about it I'm
very excited for this palette I am
planning on picking it up I mean come on
I did take up the modern renaissance
right away it came out and everybody was
so excited about it I was like oh you
know whatever else is wait for a few
reviews to come in and the reviews were
just like so overwhelmingly positive
it's so hard not to watch a
top five eyeshadow pallete my favorite
eyeshadow pallete eyeshadow pellets that
you need favorite high-end makeup right
or die holy grail videos and not see the
matter of Renaissance it isn't so many
people's videos like that it's just kind
of one of those like instant favorite
palettes and I'm not going to make the
same mistake with the cell culture
palette because I ended up having to
wait a long time it kept going out of
stock as getting so frustrated I finally
was able to purchase the palette but I
will not make that mistake again would
be self culture I will be purchasing
this it comes out maybe like a week or
so on the Anastasio website I'm probably
going to wait till it comes in Sephora
just you know or also just to be able to
get my points because that's what I do
but I am planning on purchasing d-day
that it comes on those websites because
I do not want to miss this one the
colors look so cool the colors look so
cool I not if people are getting
frustrated that we're only getting the
warm tone palette and they want to see
something different and I totally get it
and honestly like this this palette and
what we have going on I just think it's
really cool I think it's very
interesting and very unique I see a
yellow in there looks like there's
mattes and shimmers I'm just excited for
it I'm just excited for it I've been so
excited for the Mya Renaissance mr.
palette to get here and I have to say
that when I saw this palette release and
I seen the packaging and I saw the
shades inside I got really excited for
it's so different from the modern
Renaissance it is so so different than
the amount of Renaissance and I thought
that was really cool because I didn't
know how actually similar that they
would be to one another and I've just
I'm so sorry I can't wait I'm excited I
am planning on getting it and love to
know your thoughts down below are you
like not excited about the sellers at
all like you saw the shades and you were
like nope not what I was expecting not
for me
you're just not excited about it maybe
you don't like the matter of Renaissance
let us know in the comments down below
I'd love to have some conversations with
you guys down there
but it's definitely on my wish list and
I am planning on picking up the
subculture palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and then after that one
