today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post me will i buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm trying
to watch some new makeup releases and
lunches letting you know a little bit
about them and then also chatting about
if I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them as always I have a lot to chat
about this week so why don't I go ahead
and get started so first up I have an
eyeshadow palette here from BH Cosmetics
I feel like the age is coming out with a
lot recently because I've been getting a
lot of tags on items and I feel like if
they've been mentioned in my wallet
videos quite often during the last
couple of weeks months here but they are
releasing a new eyeshadow palette this
is the Studio Pro ultimate neutrals a 42
color palette 42 different shades
it says mix up light shades warm tones
deep shades of shimmer shades and Max
it's $17.99 for a special launch price
and the regular plate and the regular
price it will be 20 to 99 and to check
at the BH website as I'm filming this
video and it is still listed at the
$17.99 on the BH website so that of
course will be listed down below I will
also insert a photo in here and just
like how it says it's the ultimate
neutrals palette and it definitely lives
up to that name 42 different shades for
the $18 or the $23 whatever it may be
that is an amazing amazing price I love
that BH can still consistently keep
their prices so affordable and I do
think that they have really good quality
items I mentioned at the VH and karlie
palette in my recent invested beauty
2017 video and I've tried out a lot of
BH from their makeup to their brushes
and I think all of it is really solid
quality so that is pretty amazing to me
I am going in to pass over this
eyeshadow palette though a I have a lot
of eyeshadow palettes right now like
I've been saying the past couple but I
buy it I'm really overwhelmed with
releases right now I've been buying a
lot with Black Friday and all of that I
just have a lot of eyeshadow palettes to
get through and I really do need to do
my eyeshadow palette declutter that
really it is coming sometime not sure
when but also even though I love warm
tones and I love neutrals and that's
like my vibes and I would think that
this palette would speak to me it just
it didn't quite speak to me it kind of
reminded me a little bit of the a violet
vu
hope and nosh palette that I featured in
a will I buy a video a month or so back
when I was releasing and I just said it
was a little bit too much of the same
like the top notch palette was very very
monochromatic and I understand that this
VH pellet you know it has the lighter
shades to the darker shades and then
kind of everything in between but it's
still kind of just that one tone and
with 42 different shades it's like how
different are each of the shades going
to be have you got 42 of them like I
could even understand something a little
bit smaller and and that being the
neutral palette but a big old palette of
a lot of very very similar colors I just
don't know if that would make sense to
me and because this is you know because
you know some of my favorite tones of
eyeshadows I have a lot of pellets like
that so I probably don't need to add
even more but if you're someone who is
starting out building up your eyeshadow
collection or your makeup collection in
general I started building my collection
with BH Cosmetics like I said I really
do like the brand and I purchased so so
much from them when I was first starting
out because of their affordable prices I
hear really good things about it the
studio pro palettes that they release
and I hear a lot of good things about
their eyeshadow palettes other palettes
that I don't own myself so I think that
this would still be a good purchase
maybe for someone who is beginning
makeup if you're looking to buy a gift
for them or something like that I do
think that this would be a good purchase
but for me I don't think it would make
sense to have in my collection at this
time so I'm gonna go ahead and pass over
the BH Cosmetics ultimate neutrals 42
color eyeshadow palette but I would love
to know if you plan on picking this one
up next time I got so many tags on this
palette from color great I actually did
touch about it just a little bit in my
recent live chat I did a live anti haul
a last week so I'll leave that one list
down below but people were asking about
color green and I just touched on it
briefly but I still want to put it in
the white video because I was getting so
many questions about it so color brain
is coming out with a new eyeshadow
palette it is called cheers to beauty
so it's going to be releasing on 12:20
and from the color rate Instagram it
says we'll be celebrating life love and
beauty with the color brain
cheers to the beauty palette of 13 pan
eyeshadow and highlighter palette and
looking on the website I can see it on
the website right now though it's not
available yet at the time I'm filming it
looks like it's going to be a $56 for
the 13
hands in there said in my anti hall
video that I'm going to pass over it for
right now I actually just had a really
lovely subscriber of Marina send me the
Barry cute palette the six pan eyeshadow
palette I touched on these palettes in a
past Phil I buy a video and I said I
really wanted the very cute one but I
was holding off because of how many I
shadow piles I have right now and things
like that and I missed the sale price on
them so they were even more expensive
for this expand so I was like that was
one that like I had makeup regrets on
and marine actually sent it to me which
was super super sweet and I am so
excited to be trying that one out and
seeing the different looks I can with it
but until I try that one like I want to
try and have a good opinion on that
first before I buy a bigger eyeshadow
palette from coloured raine so that's
kind of where I'm standing with that one
right now it looks like a really pretty
eye shadow palette the greens in there
the Blues in there gold silver and then
some of these like a lighter there's
like a really pretty mob and pink I mean
those look so pretty and then there's
that highlight shade in there as well I
feel like I was really gravitating
towards this palette but again I really
want to stand firm in using the makeup
that I already have getting my reviews
up there seeing what I think about all
especially these new eyeshadow palettes
that I have and again wanting to try out
the smaller palette from colored grain
forming an opinion on it and seeing if I
would want to spend $56 on the 13 P an
eyeshadow palette because that is pretty
pricey for 13 shades and I just don't
know yet you know if I'm going to
gravitate and love the color green
shadows I feel like there probably will
because I hear a lot of good things
about them but I would like to try them
for myself personally before I go ahead
and make the $56 purchase so that's kind
of where I'm at right now with colored
brain as always I would love to hear
your thoughts did you guys get the mini
palettes you know of course the Queen of
Hearts is like the most well-known color
green eyeshadow palette I feel like or
are you planning on purchasing at this
one at come xx which will that be today
yes that will be today I'm filming on
Tuesday but that will be today when it
goes alive I will have it linked in my
description box down below of course and
let us know if you just have to get this
one from color green I want to talk
about some new releases from efendi
Beauty I got a lot of tags on the new
Fenty lipsticks that are coming
I'm reading from the treadmill on
Instagram I will have her Instagram also
listen in my description box but says
there were going to be a 14 shades of
the Matt Amoy sell Fanta beauty the
quote in here from Rihanna or bad girl
RiRi on Instagram is I wanted a lipstick
collection where every shade works on
every skin tone I wanted to prove that
lipstick is meant to be fun and not
feared and there is a whole bunch of
different lip colors I mean I see green
I see blue I see purple you know I see
the pinks and the Reds and the oranges
but there are a ton of different colors
like I feel like for 14 shades at first
that might not be a time but then when
you actually look at them they span the
entire shade range it's kind of crazy
but that is what they look like I'll
have a photo insert it in here of course
as well in cases for some reason you
have not seen them yet they're going to
be $18 a piece as says will be available
at December 26 at 9:00 est online at
Sephora as well okay and China did take
this at the holidays so I'm not sure if
these are only available around the
holidays or this will be a part of the
full collection I'm not a hundred
percent on that if you know please leave
it in the comments of course I actually
talked about this one in my anti hell as
well I just kind of answering questions
as people are asking are you gonna get
this are you gonna get this and what I
said in my anti haul was that I'm
interested in it $18 for a lipstick
isn't the most affordable but it's also
not the most expensive so I'm curious
about these I've been trying a little
bit here and there from the Fenty Beauty
line I don't think I found anything yet
that I totally love and like it turned
into my ride-or-die or Holy Grail but
I'm still interested in trying items you
know I like Rihanna
I like the direction that she's going
with her brand and kind of what she is
dating for I think all of that is really
fantastic and lipstick is one of my
favorite products so I was kind of
waiting for the lipsticks to come out I
did pick up the lip gloss in the Sephora
vib sale I think it was do you still
have the lip gloss but I think I will
get the lipstick I don't think I'll get
it right away like on December 26th but
I am planning on picking it up it'll
probably be a nude shade of course but I
want to see what I think about it it
looks to be from the name it's gonna be
a matte lipstick so I'll be excited to
try it out see how I like it pair it
with the lip gloss see how I like
but yeah I'm interested in these again
not something that I'll purchase like
the minute they go on sale but like the
next time I place an order from Sephora
or something like that I think I will
sneak in a scent a lipstick in there so
I can be able to try it out and see what
I think and see if I like it see if it
becomes a holy gorilla from the Fendi
Beauty line but I'd love to know what
are some of your favorite products from
friendiy beauty what have you absolutely
been loving are you so excited to
finally see some lipsticks in here and
are you planning on picking some up and
what shades what shades are you going to
take towards last item I have here to
talk about is a little bit different but
I got so many tags on this and then just
this morning if someone asked again if I
was going to be purchasing this and I
was like hold the phone I will have it
in tomorrow's Oh will I buy a video this
is from Beauty lish and it is the lucky
bag so I'm really glad that I was
getting tags on it because I hadn't yet
seen in Beauty licious on the site that
I go to super often but I was really
excited to get the tags on it because I
did sign up to get on the list for when
the lucky bag does go out so if you
aren't familiar with it I'll just read
this here real quick because I didn't
know about this until last year myself
so the mystery bags it says it is a $75
and you get full sized goodies and extra
surprises and then there's also limited
quantities for the extra large bag which
is 150 dollars and it comes with even
more products so basically it's gonna be
all brands that are sold on Beauty lish
they put together kind of like a
surprise bag you know something similar
to like a boxy term or an Ipsy or
something like that except it's just a
one-time thing
and beauty lish is a website that I have
wanted to order from for the longest
time they have some really cool brands
on there like Charlotte Tilbury they
have Natasha de Nonna things like that
so um when I started seeing the videos
come in last year for people who got the
lucky bag I was like oh my gosh that
looks so cool and a lot of them were
really really awesome I saw videos both
for the regular bag in the extra-large
bag and I thought that is so cool like
how did I miss that I want to get that
and so when I started getting tags that
you can get on the list so you can get
notified first for when they come out
because I believe the quantities are
pretty darn limited I was excited and I
signed up right away so I don't know
when for sure they will be here but I am
on the list I get notified when it's
coming out and I really hope that I can
purchase it I would just plan on getting
the regular ones a $75 one I don't feel
like I would need the extra large for
150 especially it being the first time
that I'm getting the lucky bag and the
first time getting anything from Beauty
lish I feel like the regular bag will
will do me just well so I'm really
excited about it I'm signed up for it I
would love to know if I am able to get
it would you guys want to see like an
unboxing type of video with that I don't
really do any sort of subscription boxes
I didn't have if see for a while I don't
have it see any more right now but I
don't really do like subscription boxes
on my channel but I thought that this
was this would be a pretty different one
since it is just a one time lucky bag
but I will have the Beauty Lycia website
listed down below if you also want to
get signed up to get notified for when
it comes out but I'd love to know if you
guys got in in the past what did you
think of it do you think it's worth it
I'm really excited the only thing that's
kind of holding me back right now is
that unfortunately over the weekend our
bank information was compromised
and we had to cancel our debit cards and
we have a lot of money missing from our
bank account not just a credit card but
from our actual bank account and happen
right before Christmas it is a that hurt
so pretty pretty bad so like I said I'm
not sure exactly when the box is coming
out um you know our bank is working on
it right now
hopefully the money will be recovered so
we don't lose out on all of that money
so please cross your fingers for that
but if we are not able to get that money
recovered or get it recovered by the
time this bag comes out I will pass over
the bag because because that sucks
um so unfortunately that did happen so
I'm gonna have to kind of just be
keeping the eye on that and you know
hoping our bank can get it all recovered
but you had to go through that
especially right before Christmas and
traveling and still having to buy gifts
for people and then stop and pay bills
like a regular person on top of all of
that has been pretty frustrating and
pretty sad so hopefully as long as the
money can get recovered and all of that
I am planning on purchasing the lucky
bag if not then it's okay it just wasn't
meant to be this year I have enough
makeup I'm happy enough as it is
I will just happily watch everybody
else's videos on box in the bag and all
of that but and then maybe next year I
could do it but I know a lot of people
get really excited for the lucky bag so
thank you guys so much for tagging me on
it I'm happy to be signed up and fingers
crossed I will be able to pick it up and
I would love to know any of your
thoughts down below but after the beauty
