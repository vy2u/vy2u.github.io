today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my role I buy at videos
every single Wednesday
I'm talking over some new makeup
releases and lunches letting you know a
little bit about them and then chatting
over if I think I'm going to pick them
up or pass over them and as always I
have a lot to chat about this week so
I'm gonna go ahead and get started
ok so Becca cosmetics it came out with a
new highlighter this has been getting a
a lot of buzz so the new highlighter is
called Dreamsicle I'll have a photo and
started here in case for some reason you
haven't seen it yet
it says swirled a soffit tangerina shade
with gold and vanilla pearl for a warm
glow it does say it's gonna be a limited
edition which I thought was interesting
and it's gonna be $38 which is the
regular price up a but the highlight
Becca highlights aren't expensive for
one highlight is $38 but they're also
some of my favorite highlights and I
have quite a few from Becca cosmetics so
when I saw a new highlight I got pretty
interested in it I liked the design in
it I liked the swirl I liked name
Dreamsicle that's fun I just I don't
think this is gonna be the best on my
particular skin tone which is okay
because I mean I have champagne pop I
have for a sec I'll pop I have rose
quartz like I'm opal like I have a lot
of Becca highlights so do I need another
one no but I was interested in it but I
just think I don't know something maybe
the shade or the word tangerine maybe
it's throwing me off and I'm like how I
don't know could I pull that off I'm not
sure and then it says it does have gold
and vanilla pearl which I don't know
this did very recently launched and I
haven't actually seen anybody like real
people with it on besides like photos on
the Becca you know Instagram page and
all of that would rather see like a non
advertisement photo of it to see what it
looks like in other skin tones
I just don't think on mine it's going to
be the best maybe not
but also at the same time I know I don't
need another Becca highlight I know I
don't need a $38 highlight get it
together girl and again you know this is
my second will I buy it after the
Sephora vib sale my haul video has gone
up in case you're interested in seeing
it I'll have it linked down below but I
have so much new makeup that you know as
I earn money on and I want to be trying
that makeup so it kind of like boost
down my like a lot makeup you know what
I'm saying like that was definitely my
vibe and last weeks will I buy a video
for sure but this one I think it looks
cool but I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over it but I would love to know if
anyone picked it up yet what do you
think so Sephora collection is coming
out the holographic at face and cheek
palette says it's an all-in-one palette
of holographic pearl it's for $28 you
get six different shades it says three
times transformers and green blue and
pink and then three times matte blush
and warm rose purple and pink I mean I
have to say I was never really on the
holographic trend in the first place I
guess I don't think that's a terrible
price for a six pan palette and you know
it looks like the sizes are you know
pretty up there and stuff but I don't
see myself wearing this at all I just
wouldn't get a ton of use out of it so
it's it's interesting but definitely not
one for me so I've got some tags on a
new collection from Besame cosmetics and
collaboration with agent Carter so it
says I'm reading from the tournament one
Instagram like I usually do so her link
will be in my description box so it says
this 19:46 collection includes 102 sweet
dreams
which is $24 an invisible dusting powder
for 35 and a passport shadow palette for
$36 what is 102 sweet dreams oh is that
the lipstick maybe that's the lipstick
okay it says will be available April
23rd on their website at the dapper day
Expo at the Disneyland Resort April 21st
and 22nd what's the dapper day Expo
that's some fun I haven't heard of that
so Besame Cosmetics is I believe in Indy
brand and you can find them on the best
my cosmetics website and some of their
products are sold at Sephora not a whole
lot of them I've noticed but if you type
investment cosmetics there's a few
things on the Sephora website but this
one just says it'll be available on
their website still the passport shadow
palette I can't see a full picture in
here but I can't tell if that's gonna be
six shades or not like I'm trying to
like mm-hmm
what are you but I see a green in there
look that looks really cool
$36 I guess I would just want to know
for sure how many shades it is the
dusting powder I'm not really interested
in and the lipstick looks to be a red so
I would probably pass over that but
I don't know I haven't tried anything
from Besame Cosmetics yet I like their
packaging I like their vibe like kind of
that vintage vibe I think that's really
cool the agent Carter collaboration
doesn't necessarily get me going
they have like a Disney collection a
while back that got my attention a
little bit more but you know again I
just got a bunch of new items to play
with so I think realistically I'm gonna
pass over this one but I mean the the
packaging is super cute on this for sure
and best my cosmetics is always one that
kinda has caught my attention I just
haven't tried anything out from them yet
but I'd love to know what you guys think
about this the collection and if you're
just like so ready for this agent Carter
collaboration and who's going to the
dapper day Expo because I think that
sounds pretty cool so laura geller is
coming out with the life glows on
illuminator palette so this is a three
pan palette it says new baked gelato
swirl illuminator trio palette that
includes a new shade it's $29 it has a
iridescent violet inside a holographic
opalescent pink that moves with the
light and then a sparkling soft gold
okay so I've never tried the laura
geller highlighters they've always been
like on like my makeup I'm gonna buy
some day lists but I've just never done
it this a it's available now at Ulta
beauty so I'll have everything linked
down below but again the same as what I
was saying with that Sephora palette
they're just not highlights that I wear
or gravitate towards a ton I'm not
really interested in like the iridescent
the holographic opalescent that's just
not typically what I reach for when I'm
going for my highlight shades so again
$29 for three shades so that's
definitely more pricey than the Sephora
collection one but it's just one that I
wouldn't get enough use out of so I
would pass over this one so this is kind
of a random thing but I found this on
the tread mood website it said that
Stila cosmetics is coming out with a new
glitter and glow liquid eye shadow in
beauty junkie so it's $24 which is the
standard price of the glitter and glows
it says rose pink with a gold Sparkle
finish and I want this just the other
day I wanted to do a like pink and
glitter eye look and I grabbed out I
have like maybe five of the Stila
glitter and glows and I thought for sure
I had one that had a lot of pink to it
but I don't because I have silver gold
Gold I have like a couple blue ones
purple but not like not a pink one and
this like this picture is what I want it
my makeup look to look like the other
day but I didn't have it and I was so
upset but so it does say it's available
now but it must just be at this deal a
website because I actually made a
purchase from Sephora this morning I'm
filming on Friday so I'm filming quite a
few days in advance here but um today
vib Rouge has the discount once again
and for vib Rouge the Marc Jacobs
fantastic bronzer or Omega runs er came
available as an exclusive faroush early
you know I bought that and I was like oh
that's perfect I'll get the Stila
glitter too and then I'll be able to use
my 15% and it'll be a fabulous magical
day but it wasn't available on the
sephora website so maybe it's coming to
sephora website i'm not sure but it was
on the Stila so i would wait until it
comes to sephora just because I have
like my rewards and and all of that but
yeah I really want that one I really do
like the Stila glitters I was on the
fence about them and I do think that
they're pricey like I would prefer to
purchase them with a discount
especially because I just don't reach
for them you know it's not something
like daily I don't have glitter daily in
my looks those uppers happens but it's
definitely like I'm like in those pink I
want this pink pretty please next up I
was getting quite a few tags and
questions on a new palette release from
nabla cosmetics hopefully I'm saying
that correctly I am not familiar with
the brand I have not purchased anything
from the brand so this is where I love
in my villa buy at videos when I'm
unfamiliar with the brand to ask you
guys about it and to leave me your
feedback because I know not only it
helps me but I'm sure it helps other
people reading comments too so it always
helps me out to know about like customer
service and shipping and all of that and
then if you would recommend anything
from the brand to like in addition to
what I'm talking about I always find
those comments super super helpful so
I'm not gonna lie when I got it tagged
on it it's called the soul bloomin
eyeshadow palette because it doesn't
have a price on this post it says it'll
be available May 3rd on the website so
when I got tagged on the palette post or
I could see all inside the photo so you
know I'm talking about I was like ah
okay like I don't know like looking at
it I was like I'm not really sure cuz I
was getting a lot of tags on it and even
being asked in last week's video if I
would talk about this palette sounds
like people are excited about this I was
like I'm not really sure it's like I'm
sold on that I don't know and then they
released swatches of the palette and I
was like those swatches look beautiful
so I'll enter the swatch photo in here
as well so you can see and I don't know
if it's maybe I just needed it swatch to
be able to tell like what these shimmers
look like it almost looks like there's
some duo crumbs in there there's of
course you know that really deep blue
that's in there that's in like every
palette right now but that blue looks
really pretty but there's like this is
really cool like these shimmer colors
just look really cool but then there's
this violet that just looks freaking
awesome and then you know we have some
Browns in there and I have to say once I
saw those swatches it totally changed
the game for me I was like wait a second
that actually looks really cool I'm
pretty interested in this once I saw
those swatches I was like okay you know
I do like to try new brands and all of
that everyone's tomorrow so when
something does catch my attention cuz
like you should I wish I could have like
shown my face when I saw it so I swear
my eyebrow shot up to my hairline that
was likewise I can't what because
looking at the palette picture and then
looking at the sponges it just it was
like a total game changer for me so I'd
like to know if you guys are interested
in this one what you think about it do
you guys think that I should get this
one or do you think I should just be
happy with my eyeshadow palettes let me
know but I really would like to see our
price on it before like I cuz you know
if it's like something astronomical I'm
probably not gonna buy it but also like
how is the shipping like what are the
shipping costs on table cosmetics I
would like to know if any of you guys
have any sort of feedback on the brand I
would love to know but I have to say
that swatch photo got me super
interested so laugh the tags on the new
laura-leigh eyeshadow palette collection
so Laura Lee is a youtuber she just
recently launched her own brain which is
called Laura Lee cosmetics she released
one eyeshadow palette a couple months
back it was called like the cat's shadow
no that's not right it was called the
cat's pajamas that right I don't know I
feel like maybe I'm saying that wrong
but
she's releasing another eyeshadow
palette and a couple new items as well
looks like she's gonna have liquid
lipsticks and eye pencils but I was
getting asked a lot of questions under
what I thought about the eyeshadow
palette which is called nudie patootie
and has 14 shades with different
finishes both matte shimmer matte
shimmer and duochrome
and it's gonna be $45 so mmm I don't
know the eyeshadow palette it didn't
sometimes it's hard to talk about when
you're talking about like fellow
youtubers because people get very like
critical what you're saying because it's
not just like a brand you know it's not
just like a CEO putting out stuff it's
you know it's the youtuber and I totally
understand that as a youtuber it can
definitely be very challenging but I
don't know it didn't it didn't do
anything for me it didn't speak to me
and I'm someone who like I have a
neutral fan you know I get told like my
makeup looks are boring a lot and that's
fine but even this is pretty neutral but
it still didn't it didn't do anything
for me at all there looks to be like a
nice pink in there and like a nice pink
shimmer maybe like a gold shimmer in
there too I'm kind of looking up the
swatches as well but nothing that like
got my juices flowing I was like yes I'm
super excited about that I feel like
that I've seen some people saying it
looks like the soft glam and I honestly
I don't even know if I agree with that
the soft glam got me hyped I feel like
the soft glam just looks more
interesting and more not even like
colorful but you just have more like
there's so many shades in here that I
feel like look very similar to one
another and I just imagine like blending
on my eye and it would be like the same
thing so I don't know and especially for
$45 I mean I paid 42 for the soft glam I
didn't pay for the soft clay my friend
Katie sent it to me get it together
Samantha I paid forty two dollars for
the modern Renaissance and the
subculture my friend Katie sent me the
soft glam but that's $42 so you're
having to pay more for you know a new
brand and all of that and I feel like
I'm pretty sure it was the cat's pajamas
now that I'm saying I think I'm pretty
sure that's correct I felt like that
palette got a lot of mixed feedback so
I'm not really I'm not sold on this one
but again like the color selection it's
just it didn't jump out at me right away
if you if you take away who was behind
it like no matter what brand was putting
this out and I were to look at that
palette it didn't you know it did jump
at me because that's how I saw it for
the first time when I just saw the tanks
coming in I didn't even read to see what
it was what brain it was anything and I
wouldn't have known just by looking at
that palette photo that wouldn't have
automatically said to me that Laura Lee
Los Angeles just because you know knew
her brand I'm not familiar with like you
know I don't feel like she hasn't like
branding set up yet like some other
brands do so I had no idea that it was
her palette but it didn't jump out at me
I did do a double-take or anything like
that so especially for being at the $45
I'm more interested in the nabla
cosmetics one all right now those colors
got me excited those you know kind of
made my eyes pop so I just I don't think
it's gonna be for me I'll be interested
to see the reviews for it of course but
it's just it
I don't want again I don't want to say
boring but I feel like it's just a
little bit too plain for me and that's
coming from a girl with pretty plain
taste as I'm super pink today but that's
not what I think about the Laura Lee Los
Angeles palette I'd love to know if you
guys are gonna pick it up though but
it's just not gonna be for me and then
the last item that I'm gonna talk about
this week is a mascara actually and this
is from milk makeup I started getting a
lot of tags on it and I was like let's
kind of random because I don't feel like
I was just seeing that I was getting
tagged on mascara and I was like it was
kind of weird cuz I don't feel like
mascaras or where they get tagged on a
lot of you know what I'm saying and I
was like okay so those makeup is coming
out with the mascara and then I started
reading about it and I was like so this
is called the cush mascara it says one
boy one hit for high volume this is
awkward
it says CBD rich cannabis oil and it
says to condition lashes for thickness
about the fallout and don't worry
there's no psychoactive THC so the only
thing getting high are your lashes
that's fantastic but I do have to say
like once I saw that and I just I don't
always you know you see the word
cannabis and mascara I'm like wait wait
what's happening here it's awkward as
I'm filming on 4/20 it says heart shaped
fibers a lock under lashes in every
direction for a long-lasting volume and
curl
what is this real is this a I feel like
is a freaking April Fool's joke once
again since the puff-puff brush densely
packed a brush evenly coats and lifts
lashes from root to tip for a defined
clump Ria's act it's vegan in $24 I feel
like I'm freaking reading in April
Fool's or something because that is just
really weird for a mascara it is it's
available on the Sephora website it is
for sale because I honestly I almost
ordered it this morning when I was doing
Marc Jacobs especially when the Stila
glitter I wasn't there I was like should
I get this mascara I kind of want to see
reviews on it first though I'm just
because it it it sounds interesting it
sounds like it has a lot of claims but
that was just so weird to read out loud
on camera I'm not gonna lie all I read
first wasn't the cannabis oil one and I
read through it and then I checked this
for website to make sure like I wasn't
going crazy but I did read the like the
puffs puffs fresh oh boy that's just
interesting but honestly I'm interested
in this one it's $24 for a mascara I
wear false lashes mostly so a lot of
times I don't like to pay like full
price or purchase like a high priced
mascara just because I don't get a ton
of use out of them but the claims that
sound pretty interesting it got my
attention even without all the 420 notes
of it but I'm definitely interested in
getting a couple of reviews but if it
sounds like a good mascara I might go
ahead and do it like I said I had it
like I was looking at it on the sephora
website like should I do it should I not
do it and then especially with the 50%
off I was like I should just do it but
again I got something to make it play
with I want to play with it and it's
just one that I would like to see a
couple reviews on before I decide to
purchase it myself so that's kind of
when I think about the new milk makeup
mascara I'd love to know what you guys
think tell me what you think in the
comments down below that was really
awkward for me to read all on camera not
even gonna lie but after that that's
gonna do it for this week's will I buy a
video so that is everything for this
week's will I write video I hope that
you enjoyed it or you found it helpful
or entertaining in some way as always
let me know what you thought about all
the products that I mentioned what has
your attention what are you saying
no to and let me know what you want to
see featured in the next weeks of it I
buy a video like I've been saying the
last couple weeks I'm trying to put more
items in here so let me know anything
that catches your attention and I will
gladly get it in next week's video but
as always if you guys would enjoy this
one I hope that you'll give it a thumbs
up I hope that you'll also consider
subscribing before you go
