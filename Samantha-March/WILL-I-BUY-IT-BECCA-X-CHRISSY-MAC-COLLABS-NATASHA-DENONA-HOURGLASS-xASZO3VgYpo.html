today's video is going to be a new will
I buy video I plus my will i buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about new makeup new product launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then letting you know if I plan to
purchase them and why or why not like I
said I do post these every single
Wednesday so I will have my playlists a
link down below I also post on Thursdays
Sundays and Mondays so you do get videos
from me four times a week so I hope that
you will hit the subscribe button and
become a part of the fam I do have a
couple giveaways going on right now my
15k giveaway is ending very very soon so
you want to make sure to get entered in
that there is it's probably the biggest
giveaway that I've ever done on my
channel it's ginormous and then I also
have a giveaway for the new morphe 35o
palette so both of those giveaways will
be linked down below but as always with
my will i buy videos i have a lot to
talk about so why don't I go ahead and
jump into it so first up I want to talk
about some new blushes from hourglass
cosmetics I got a few tags on Instagram
for this so they have the ambient strobe
lighting blush the trend mood Instagram
it says it's a blush which combines the
illuminating effects of the ambient
strobe lighting powder and gives glow
and color to your cheeks they're in four
different shades and they are $38 each
so I will insert some photos and here
like I normally do I'm gonna go ahead
and pass over these I actually don't
think I've ever tried anything from
hourglass I've never tried their ambient
strobe lighting
I know those get kind of mixed feedback
from people I think you have to have I
think you have to really want it and
want the specific shades because some
people say they can use it as a
highlight and some people say they use
it as more like an all-over face to give
you a little bit of a glow I don't know
I just feel like I hear such strange
things about it this might have to be
something where I'd actually like go in
and try it and see if it worked for me
but I never have looked really cool and
I mean same with the the ambient strobe
lighting they always look cool the
packaging looks cool the actual product
looks cool but I don't think that I need
it and $38 for one blush like hourglass
is definitely more of a expensive brand
and $38 for one blush just does
scream to me like that's a good idea you
know what I'm saying
I also I'm not a huge blush fanatic and
I feel like I have a lot of blushes for
someone who says she's not a blush
fanatic so I think I'm pretty good for
blushes so I probably don't need to
spend thirty-eight dollars on a new
blush so there's going to be two new
ambient lighting bronzer shades and you
know I'm gonna pass over them as well
that didn't say a price but I'm assuming
it's gonna be around the $38 as well
it's just a little bit too pricey for me
and something that I don't think I need
right now I also have to keep in mind
that the Sephora vib sale is coming up
so I know that I'm planning it's
probably going on as this video goes
live so I know that I'm gonna be buying
a lot for that so I need to kind of keep
that in the back of my mind when I'm
thinking about what I'm going to
purchase because I usually go a little
crazy during that sale my Sephora VIP
recommendations video and what I want to
pick up that should be running as well
so I'll have that link down below but I
know even though if I could pick this up
with the 50% off it's just not something
I need and I'm not drawn to it enough
and like I said I'm not loyal at all to
the hourglass brand you know some some
brands you're just super super loyal to
and you get excited for all the new
releases I'm not there yet with
hourglass maybe I will be someday but
for me I'm going to go ahead and skip
over the new blushes and the new
bronzers just not something that I need
but as always let us know in the
comments down below do you absolutely
love these do you love the ambient light
strobe powders you need to have these
blushes and bronzers like are they some
of your favorite products or are you
gonna pass over this as well let us know
in the comments down below so I got a
couple tags on this on Instagram as well
this is new from Natasha de Nonna
so her new palette is a sculpting glow
palette I think there are going to be
two different palettes for different
skin tones and they're going to be $89
each there is six shades in them three
are cream shapes and then three are
going to be powder shades they'll be
available April 25th online at Sephora
and then May 12th it'll be available in
stores trend mood is also saying it will
be available on Beauty lish so I really
love like contour bronzing contour
palettes highlighting it's super what
I'm into right now and I'm buying a lot
of them so there's that
but at the same time that I'm saying I'm
buying a lot of them I am and I probably
don't need to buy more especially a kit
for $89 Patridge anona is definitely
she's a pricey pricey brand I hear
amazing things about a lot of the
products though really good things like
especially the eyeshadow pellets but
some of her eyeshadow palettes are like
over $200 which is crazy to me but I
hear really fantastic things about them
so I really like I have feel like I have
no doubt that this is going to be a
great palette but at $89 and with all of
the bronzers and contours and palettes
and highlights that I have recently
bought in I cannot justify spending $89
on another one like it's hard enough for
me everyday when I'm doing my makeup to
constantly be reaching for the newer
stuff I have a little like tray on my
desk behind me my super messy desk I
have a little tray on there and I put
everything that is newer or that I'm in
you know the review period process I put
it in that tray because that way when
I'm doing my makeup I can look right in
there and I can grab out what's new what
I need to be trying what I need to make
sure to remember to try and that tray is
overflowing like tray is so full that I
have a whole circle around the tray of
still new products because that hasn't
because that is how much I have been
buying and I'm kind of ashamed to say
that a lot of it is bronzers a lot of
its contour powders and a lot of his
highlighters so I don't need another one
right now and at $89 it's just too
pricey and I don't think it would be
available during the VIP sale I think
the vib sell ends the 24th and it says
this will be online on the 25th so there
wouldn't even be able to be a discount
with it which is a huge bummer but I'm
gonna go ahead and pass over it but like
I said I hear great things about the
brand I don't own anything from Natasha
to Nona myself I again I'm just not
loyal to this brain at all it's
definitely not a product I think I need
especially right now and at the price of
course let us know in the comments down
below is this something that you
absolutely have to have you have it on
your radar what other products from
Natasha de Nonna do you love let us know
I love hearing your comments I have been
getting asked a lot of questions on the
mac cosmetics collaboration so Mac
monix is doing a collab with ten
influencers from all over the world and
i believe each influencer is creating a
lipstick so I've seen about this I've
heard about it I'm not familiar with all
of the influencers involved but I did
recognize a couple of the names and I
thought it was really cool a neat collab
idea and from the trend moon Instagram
access they'll be available in the US on
April 20th I'm not sure how much the
lipsticks are gonna be I couldn't find a
price if I do it will be listed in the
description box down below and recently
I've been seeing on snapchats
a lot of other Beauty influencers are
getting a couple of the lipsticks and
they all seem to be getting the Laura
Lee and Gabriel Zamora sure if they're
only getting two or just everybody's
just showing those two I'm not I'm not
really sure what's happening to be
honest I'm just not really paying that
much attention to the collab because it
just is not doing anything for me
I don't gravitate towards mac cosmetics
I know a lot of people do I know a lot
of people buy from that brand and love
the brand I know a lot of people really
love the MAC lipsticks but I'm just not
very loyal to MAC Cosmetics and I've
talked about it in the past but it sucks
but I've had terrible customer service
at the only Mac store we have in my area
like really bad every single time that
I've gone I know that those employees
you know don't stand for Mac and they
don't they shouldn't represent the
entire Mac company trying to get better
at it and move past it and I recently
was gifted a couple of matte lipsticks
which I was very very grateful for
because I've never actually tried a MAC
lipstick I've only tried the Mike
lipsticks a total of three times now
they're in my to review to keep trying
out a tray that is on my desk behind no
bar I think they're nice I'm into them I
like the shapes that I have so I think
that's all good there but when I saw
this collab even though I was like oh
yeah that's really neat idea that's
really cool
ten influencers from all over really
super neat but it just didn't do
anything for me it didn't speak to me
and I feel like I could have a really
unpopular opinion here but especially
the two that I keep hearing the most
about and now that I'm seeing the
swatches and I'm seeing
people on snapchat talk about the Laura
Lee and Gabrielle Zamora I don't
gravitate towards them either I have
been subscribed to Laura Lee for a while
and I used to watch her videos like
really faithfully I felt like and I just
I don't know I'm just you know we get to
pick and choose who we like and who our
personalities mesh with I'm not saying
like I hate her or Gabrielle or I don't
think they're good people or anything
like that I'm just saying like our I
don't think our personalities mesh so I
just they just don't do anything for me
you know I'm trying to say this in the
nicest terms that I can because I don't
have anything like really bad to say
about them by any means but there's so
many other influencers that if they were
coming out to collab even if I didn't
need it I would still buy it to support
them
like Carly Bibles eyeshadow palette
super stoked for have already
pre-ordered it that Casey Holmes came
out with a collab with Smashbox and even
though I did not need any more
highlighters in my life I bought a
palette anyways simply to support Casey
because she's one of my favorite
influencers so you know it's kind of
like one of those things I think maybe
if there was an influencer in that Mac
collab that I felt that connection with
that I deal with someone like Carli
bybel Casey Holmes like even Jacqueline
hell I buy a lot of her collabs
kathleenlights if I love her collapse I
think if there was someone in that
category for me personally I would
probably buy one of these Mike lipsticks
but I'm just not so I feel really bad
saying that and I'm not sure why I'm not
sure why because I don't know if I feel
like I have to defend myself because I
don't like every single person I mean
that's just the way it is and not
everybody likes me and not everybody's
personality will mesh with mine and I
understand that but that's just kind of
my feelings on the mat collab so again
was not being loyal at all to the Mac
brand still in the testing process of
seeing how I even like the Mike
lipsticks and if there's something that
I would repurchase and then having none
of the influencers be someone who I
really felt that passion to support a
collab I'm gonna pass over this
collaboration so those are just kind of
my thoughts on it I mean again this is
what these wilayat videos are all about
and I always
bye-bye uh this should be a
judgment-free zone it's makeup it's your
money it's your purchases you know you
get to decide what you spend your money
on and nobody should judge you for that
no one should judge you for if you
support this person over that person or
if you love this person but don't love
that person you know it's just it's what
makes us who we are and it what makes us
different and those are just kind of my
thoughts on it but I'd love to know what
you guys think as well because I've been
hearing more and more about this collab
and I've been seeing a couple of vlogs
going up I haven't actually like watched
them but I think there's a lot of blogs
about the actual experience of being in
the lab and like making the lipsticks
which I think would be interesting to
watch I just haven't watched any of them
yet but I'd love to know what you think
about the club if there's any lipsticks
you want to pick up or you know who from
that influence or group like who's your
you know like your BFF that you really
feel that you really want to collab and
you really want to buy their lipstick
when it comes out I'd love to know you
know maybe your recommendations maybe I
can find someone new there are so many
beauty influencers guys like there are
so many and sometimes people will
comment in my videos and say like hey do
you watch so-and-so and I'm like no I've
never even heard of them but thank you
like now I can go watch someone new and
know who some of your favorites are so
maybe I can check them out as well
because like I said other than Laura Lee
and Gabrielle Zamora who I don't really
know Gabrielle Zamora at all I've seen
him on a couple of like snapchats and
stuff but I haven't really watched
anything more than that but those were
the only two names that like I really
really recognized but let me know just
let me know in the comments down below
who do you think I should check out who
do you think I should start watching
their videos and let me know what you
think about this Emeka cosmetics
collaboration and oh my the tags have
started coming in fast and furious when
this one was announced so Becca
cosmetics is doing a collaboration with
Chrissy Teigen super cool I had no idea
but that was coming you know no one like
phoned me and like you know gave me a
heads up it's very strange second bye
Chrissy they're coming out with a glow
face palette it includes a skin
Perfector pressed in rose gold which is
Chrissy Teigen favorite highlighter
other ones are new shades in Beach
nectar Malibu Soleil and there's a blush
in hippest
bloom it's going to be limited edition
most collabs are going to be limited
edition and it is going to release in
early May all around the world it's
gonna be $46
so this one is honestly a really tough
one for me it really is I really enjoy
it Becca cosmetics I like a lot of their
products I've had a really good
experience with a lot of that I've
purchased from them
I like Chrissy Teigen I wouldn't say
like I'm a huge fan of Chrissy Teigen by
any means but I like her and I think
she's really funny I think she's really
like down-to-earth and relatable so I
enjoy that I'm not like a writer died
for her I guess like I am like a Blake
Lively like I'm like if this was a
collab with Blake Lively I would be
dying right now like this one I feel
like I'm on the fence about because I
feel like I really like it I like the
packaging I like Becca I like Chrissy 46
dollars for the four shades I mean
that's pretty that's the price that I
would say that I would guess that this
would be yet Rebecca I just I don't
think that I need it I know I know I
don't need it not that I just don't
think I don't need it I know that I
don't need it because I have blushes and
highlighters and bronzers and I have
lots of new ones and I'm still trying to
make my way through them you know
everything that I've just said in this
video so this is a tough one for me
because I feel like I really do want it
it's just one of those things where I
have to decide want versus need and what
is more important and honestly I think
I'm I think I'm gonna pass over it I
think I think it's gonna be better for
me right now to say no to it just just
looking at everything on that tray and
everything to run into the tray and all
of the makeup that I need to get through
I just know it's not going to be the
smartest purchase and I know that it's
definitely if the scales are tipping the
scales are more in the want versus need
for sure and I just I don't think that I
need to do it I don't think I need to do
it do I want it yes do I need it no and
I think I can go ahead and talk myself
out of this one you like this one it
just I feel like it wouldn't get enough
love for me that I wouldn't use it
enough so I just it this is really hard
for me this is really hard for me but I
mean
I'm gonna pass over it I know especially
with the vib sale coming up Alta just
came out with another 20% off coupon so
I know I'm gonna be using that I know
I'm gonna be spending a lot of money on
makeup and I know I don't need it so I'm
gonna pass over it
mmm that was really hard to do I'm gonna
pass over it but let me know in the
comments down below are you guys super
excited for this one I feel like what
the amount of tanks that we're coming in
on Instagram I feel like a lot of you
are super stoked for this so I'd love to
know what are your feelings on the Becca
Chrissy collab like did you guys see
that coming because I totally did not
see that coming do you love Chrissy is
