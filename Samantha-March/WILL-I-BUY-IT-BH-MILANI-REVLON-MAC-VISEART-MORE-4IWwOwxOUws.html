today's video is going to be my will I
buy it I post have a live out videos
every single Wednesday from talking over
some new makeup releases giving my
thoughts on them and then trying to
decide if I'm gonna fix them up or pass
over them and as always I have a lot to
chat about this week so let me go ahead
and get started alright
I'm really excited to be filming cuz I
haven't filmed and I think it's been
like five days I'm just back from my
Oklahoma vacation not vacation work
conference not a vacation I'm just back
from my Oklahoma trip I got back
yesterday I wasn't sure if I was gonna
film today but it's always fun to come
back to film one of my favorite videos
which is definitely my will I buy it
so let's go alrighty so BH Cosmetics is
coming out the new palette I got a ton
of tags on this one and it is called the
nuevo neutrals
it's a 26 color palette it has both
eyeshadows and then also blushes shades
and it's only gonna be 16 dollars which
is so crazy so it says it'll be
available May 8th on the BH website so
it should already be for sale so I'll
have it linked down below and also BH
Cosmetics is sold on Ulta not everything
is sold at Alta but some things are sold
at Alta so it may I don't see anything
about it but maybe it'll be coming to
Ulta as well ok so I got excited when I
saw how many tags were coming in it
seemed like a lot of people are really
excited over this and I I really enjoy
palettes that have more than one thing
going on I think it's why I have such a
love for face palettes and I like pilots
that have eyeshadows and something else
like the Carli bybel BH palette has
eyeshadows and highlighters I really
enjoy that I think it's really cool so I
was excited when I saw this I feel like
I've been kind of getting more into
blushes lately as well like they're
getting me more excited so when I saw
eyes shadows and blushes I was like
super cool but I don't think that this
one is gonna be for me I think this one
is going like I'm a neutral fan I'm a
neutral fan I'm a neutral lover I
gravitate towards those pellets a ton
but sometimes like there's also a limit
you know what I'm saying and sometimes
when a palette comes out and it's like
too neutral or too similar to so many
other palettes that I have in my
collection
like I
can't get really excited for it and I
feel like that's what's happening with
this bh1 like I really I enjoy the tones
that are in there I wear these types of
shades a lot if I didn't have my
plethora of neutral palettes I would
maybe go for this one but I do and it's
man and I like that it has the blushes
and there's well and it looks like a
nice variety of blushes from what I can
tell from the photo so that's really
cool it's not like we're just getting
five shades of like a varying side of
pinky you know what I'm saying
so I think that that's really cool as
well and sixteen dollars is insane
that's an insane price for this palette
I think that's so awesome but I just
can't get excited about it and again
it's just sometimes it's one of those
weird things that you have trouble
explaining because you know oh yes I
have a lot of neutral palettes and then
soft glam came out and I was like needed
you know I'm saying and it's so it's
hard to explain why you gravitate
towards one thing and why you maybe
don't gravitate towards another but this
was just one of those releases that I
ate instantly was like I don't need it I
have others my collection you can move
on and like I say in my will I bite
videos if something doesn't give me a
double take if something doesn't make me
feel like I absolutely need this I will
not try to talk myself into it because
there is so many makeup releases and so
many items that I do get really excited
for that that's what I should be
considering should I put my money
towards that so when the BH one didn't
give me those bags right away I know
that I can go ahead and pass over it but
it's a really pretty palette and that
price point is ridiculous way to go BH
okay another more affordable style
palette we have one coming out from
Milani cosmetics and once again I got a
lot of tags on this one and it seems
like a lot of people are really really
excited for this palette this is called
the gilded desires it's an eye on face
palette so once again like those types
of palettes make me pretty excited it
does say it's a limited edition palette
which I thought was interesting flesh
bummer so it says new formulas and
finishes and mattes and shimmer metallic
includes a mirror it's going to be
twenty dollars all it says that I see it
says coming soon so I don't have a date
yet so it's the bottom two are
highlighters and then the other ones are
eyeshadows so I will say that it
- coming out - see it's a new formula
and all of that because so many people
really enjoyed the it was a couple of
bold obsessions
I know hooter has the obsessions as well
I think it was the bold obsessions that
blondie came out and I believe they had
two other eyeshadow palettes and so many
people were so excited about those those
are getting great reviews great hype so
then you see new formula and it's like
why like I just I don't know it's one of
those things that kind of baffles me
that makeup companies do people fall in
love with your products people fall in
love with your formula and it's like but
we're gonna change it that's kind of a
bummer so if it didn't say that I feel
like I to me it would be like yes I'm
gonna snap this up but once again it's
like okay well then do you have to wait
for the reviews to come out to see what
everybody else is saying and how the
formula is like come on man but but the
packaging looks beautiful I love that
there's a mere twenty dollars that's
great I don't know if this one would be
available at Walmart as well but I know
people were saying that they saw the
bold obsessions if that's what they were
they saw them at Walmart for like a
couple dollars cheaper - or like five
maybe five dollars cheaper or something
like that so that's something to think
of but this looks really beautiful the
into like the shimmer and the metallic
shades they look really beautiful I like
that there's highlighters included as
well the swatches look really beautiful
this one has me really curious and
because so many people love that other
Milani one I'm like should I get this
one as well I don't know I wonder how
many looks I could come up with it
though that's I feel like that's one
thing that I'm thinking when I look at
the swatches I'm like how many different
looks am I going to create with this
palette so this one I'm like kind of on
the fence about oh it says it's an Ulta
Beauty exclusive as well thank you so
much reading from the turn would one
Instagram her page will be listed down
below of course this one I'm like I'm
like a little bit on the fence about but
I'm pretty interested in it I'm pretty
interested in it I might go for this one
what do you guys think this has me
pretty intrigued way to go Milani
they're really stepping up their game so
Oprah Cosmetics is coming out with new
metallic liquid eyes shadows there's
three different shades under $15 each
I'll try to include a swatch photo in
here as well so this will be available
May 16th on the Oprah website and again
offers also flow that also so they might
be coming to Ulta as well
these months I'm not interested in
though I just don't reach for these
types of products a lot and I've said
this before I think I talked about the
Milani ones last week I just don't
research these a lot I would rather just
reach from my regular eyeshadows and so
this one doesn't have me really hyped to
me it's like not an exciting release but
that's simply because that's my personal
makeup preference I'm sure there's a ton
of people that are gonna be pretty
excited about it but for me that one's
just kind of like a yeah I don't need
that one but we have an interesting
release that I'm hearing a lot of buzz
about a lot of people seem to be pretty
excited for a new foundation from Revlon
this is the color stay full coverage
foundation along where it says 24-hour
matte finish I don't see a price on it
but it says it's in stores now let me
see if I can find the price so it says
that's available in stores I found it on
the Revlon website but it won't let me
like I can't see a price I can't add it
to my bag and it says buy from these
retailers and I was also listed it has
Target listed as CBS listed I've clicked
on all three of those websites and it
says foundation not found so that's not
pretty frustrating that's kind of
annoying so I don't know how much this
is because I'm I'm not currently in a
store so I can't see that but online
it's not telling me anything so if I can
find the price I'll put it on the screen
here but a lot of people seem to be
pretty excited about this one
I'm pretty curious about it as well
the last Revlon foundation that I tried
was the Revlon mr.eddy
photo insta filter photo ready
foundation there's something along those
lines and I hated it like I oh I did not
like it at all I thought it looks so bad
on my skin so I'm a little bit on the
Leary side like do I really want to try
this foundation i dodo it also is since
it says full coverage I'm more of like
medium coverage and especially in the
summer I don't really love to go full
coverage is cuz I spend so much time
outside and I don't want to feel like I
have like on my face you know what I'm
saying so I don't know if I'm gonna get
this one I feel like I'm still having
like a little bit of saltiness towards
the other other Revlon foundation
knowing that it's full coverage it's
also a matte finish that is also not my
favorite I liked
a little bit of doing is to me I do have
dry skin so I don't typically lean
towards Matt so this one like I'm on the
fence about like that I would be curious
to try it but I feel like there's too
many like cons leaning into it that I
feel like I probably shouldn't do it so
I'm on the fence about this one but
leaning more towards know like the
Milani eyeshadow palette I'm on the
fence leaning towards yes but let me
know what you think about the Revlon
foundation and if you would give this
one a try so many tags on a new Sephora
favorites collection stud I love when
you guys tag me when these come out
because so many times I miss them so got
lots of tags on the sunkissed glow
so Sephora they put out these Sephora
favorites collections and sometimes they
do it by lip products sometimes they do
it by like what I'm going to be talking
about is bronzers I do hair and perfume
and mascaras and I really enjoyed these
I buy a lot of them especially the lip
ones and I just think they're a good
value and you can try out new things and
I don't I just I like them a lot so I
love when you guys take me on new ones
because I always they always make me do
a double-take
so this one is the sunkissed glow it's
$40 it says it's a $99 value so you get
the the Becca cosmetics sunlit bronzer
and Capri coast the benefit hoola and
natural bronze the CIT London dewy
sticks luminous highlighting balm the
hourglass cosmetics vanished flashed
highlighting stick and champagne flash
the Laura Mercier matte radiance based
powder in highlight oh one the milk make
up highlighter in lit and the Tarte
cosmetics Amazonian clay waterproof
bronzer in Park Avenue princess so it's
kind of like a mix between bronzer and
highlighter products I think that's so
cool
oh my I think this is a really good
value I don't see on here which ones are
full-size and which ones are mini most
times the majority of them are minis and
then there's like one maybe one or two
products that is full-sized I can leave
it listed down below which one is the
full-size or put it on the screen if I
can find that information I'm not gonna
get it though because I have the Becca
bronzer I have the benefit bronzer I
have the milk makeup highlighter I have
the Tarte cosmetics bronzer so the only
ones I don't have are from sea otter
London hourglass and Laura Mercier and
that's not you know maybe
if I only have like two products from
there it would still be a good value for
me to try out but since I have almost
half of what's in there it's not really
gonna be a great value for me personally
so I'm not gonna be getting it but I
think these are really cool I love the
sets I'm always recommending them if
they would be a good value for you as
well or maybe I always recommend like do
you have a friend who wants a few items
in there as well and you can go in
together and like split the products I
think it would be great so this is a
great set especially for summer there's
some really cool products in there it's
just not gonna be for me so I'm moving
on MAC Cosmetics is coming off a new
product that has been intrigued it is a
new addition to the fix+
family this is gonna be the fix plus mat
it says it will be available around May
31st online and in stores I'm really
excited about this Mac has been having
some new additions to the fix plus line
I know they added in like since I have
the lavender one I want to say it is and
then they also came out with like the
shimmer fix plusses and now they're
coming out with the matte and I'm
actually really excited for this this is
a perfect summer release I think so even
though I was just saying I'm not someone
who likes to be super super super matte
I do like to be a little bit more dewy
sometimes in the summer since I am
outside a lot it can kind of get a
little bit more on the extreme side
usually entering into the warmer weather
I go back to pretty normal skin instead
of really dry skin nice day you know
we've had nice weather for a while come
on make sure you stay please we actually
have our AC turned on last night that
was pretty wild first time of the year
so as we get into the warmer months
that's when I'm more and I am more
normal and I can tell going outside like
there's just times right look in the
mirror like one powder my face you know
what I'm saying that's what the Urban
Decay all nighter setting powder has me
all excited that I chatted about last
week but this one definitely has me
really excited because a lot of my
setting sprays are kind of focusing on
you know more like a dewy style finish
because that's normally what I gravitate
towards you know I live in Iowa we have
like a solid eight weeks of war mother
you know inside and then it's cold again
love it but that's mostly what my
collection is comprised of and so I
would love to add in a matte spray
especially for the summertime I think
that's a great idea I'm thinking like
when I go to
the the Iowa State Fair you know what I
mean to have that Matt fix+ in there to
spray in my face that's perfect that
would be great
that would be great so yeah I did I
definitely am interested in this one I
am planning on picking that up what do
we got next
Oh a palette from busy arts okay here we
go
so busier is coming out with a new eyes
shadow palette so this is called the
busy art petit pro3 it's going to be $30
it has eight different shades I have two
of the pro tea Pro palettes I'm pretty
sure so this one petite Pro 3 it should
already be online this is a pretty
palette like I do think it's very pretty
I really enjoyed that olive shade in
there and I like some of the pink tones
in there but again it's just one of
those that like it just didn't get me
excited you know what I'm saying I just
I didn't really do much of a double take
at it $30 for the 8 shades
I mean busier does a more expensive
brand so it's definitely higher priced
and all that but I mean it does come
with a mirror and I like the packaging I
guess I do have the other ones which I
thought the other ones were like $45 but
I totally couldn't be wrong you know I
still got flavor another I wasn't really
gonna film today like I was like you're
gonna take Monday off but that's why you
pre fill them so hard so you could have
Monday off but like my flights on Sunday
we're pretty darn smooth especially
compared to Thursday I got a relaxed
last night I went to sleep early so I
woke up today like let's get it done so
that's why I mean if I still look a
little worse for wear it's cuz I've been
you know traveling and all that but yeah
it's just one of those palettes that it
just didn't intrigued me enough and like
I always try to say my rollabout videos
don't try to talk yourself into makeup
and sometimes it can be hard especially
as a youtuber you know I get comments up
it's my job to buy all of the makeup at
the same time it's also you know I can't
make money off of youtube so it's very
confusing you know you're very
conflicting things as a youtuber but if
you're youtuber or not I don't feel like
you need to talk yourself into makeup if
it's like you know I'm really popular
release the popular brand or everyone
seems into it if you're not into it
you're not into it and there's gonna be
another makeup product that you're gonna
be more into so I'm not gonna
go ahead and reach for that one then I
think I just have one more item on my
list here let's see yeah these are some
new liquid lipsticks and these are from
sugarpill so they are coming out with
their high tea collection is what it's
called and they have five different
shades of a liquid lipsticks and let's
see do they have a price on these these
are gonna be $18 each no there's four
five shades five shades five shades $18
each will be available May 14th on their
website and May 11 through 13th at the
RuPaul drag Con booth well there you go
who is going to that okay so the high
tea collection see now this time we
interested you know it's like you never
you just you think you know what's gonna
get you interested you think you know
what's gonna make you do double take and
then something comes along and kind of
surprises you I say that because I've
never tried anything from sugarpill
their brand I've never tried I don't
really have anything to go off of from
me personally but for whatever reason
these are kind of getting my attention I
really enjoy the packaging on them $18 I
mean that's high for a liquid lipstick
but not the highest price I've ever paid
lawless beauteous $25 so there's that um
so I don't know I feel like I shouldn't
though and here's why because I just
bought a lawless video lipstick in the
support VIP sale I also bought a cap and
a lipstick I also just did lipstick
collection D clutters both on like my
nude and pink lipsticks my red and
colorful lipsticks I just did my lip
glosses the other day and I feel like I
feel like I'm really happy with my
collection I'm happy with the
organization that I have now like I
don't have lipsticks overflowing
everywhere so it's like should I spend
$18 for a liquid lipstick that I really
have no idea how it's gonna perform I
don't know what the the formula is gonna
be like probably shouldn't do it but
these have my attention for sure they
really do they sound nice I like the
packaging I think I'm gonna go ahead and
say no unless I see a bunch of people
like really saying really really good
things about them and that they're
really awesome liquid lipsticks these
got my attention but I'm gonna try to be
a good girl and be happy with how I got
my lipstick collection going
right now but let me know what you think
about this release from a sugar pill but
after that that's gonna do it for this
week's will I buy a video yes and that's
gonna be everything for this week's of
Ally my video I really hope that you
enjoyed it or you found a helpful or
entertaining in some way again apologies

on the flighty side no pun intended but

in Oklahoma City and a wonderful time
