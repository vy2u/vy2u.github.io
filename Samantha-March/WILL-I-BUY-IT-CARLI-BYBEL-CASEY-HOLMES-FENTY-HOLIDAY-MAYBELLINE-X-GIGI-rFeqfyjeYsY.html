today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my bail about videos
every single Wednesday talking about a
new makeup releases and lunches letting
you know a little bit about them and
then letting you know if I'm going in to
pick them up or pass over them I always
having time to chat about in these
videos so why don't we go ahead and get
started
this week's well a right video has a
little bit of everything I have
drugstore I have holiday and then the
last few items I'd talk about are
actually going to be fashion but they
are with beauty influencers here on
YouTube so I did want to touch on those
because I was getting some questions on
them but I will kick it off first with
the drugstore item a lot of questions
have this one that is coming out from
Maybelline it is in collaboration with
model Gigi Hadid and this is the
jetsetter palette that we have seen so
far apparently she is going to be
releasing a full collection and there's
going to be three different items and
there I was looking at the Ulta website
i do list the three different
collections in there others west coast
glam there's east coast glam and then
there is also jetsedder I will insert
the photo in here of the jetsetter
palette it will be limited edition as
I'm assuming the whole collection is
most collaborations are it includes two
concealers tulip bulbs for eyeshadows
one blush one matte bronzer one
highlighter in one mini mascara and all
that is going to be a twenty nine and
ninety nine again on the auto website it
says all of the collections will be
available October 22nd and then they
will be in stores on November 5th
looking at the photo because when I was
getting asked and when I was reading the
messages that were coming in about this
a lot of people were like $30 for
drugstore once again we just went
through this with the NYX in your
elements eyes shadow pellets I picked up
the fire one to try out Asbury I was
very interested in seeing why the
drugstores hitting us was is there you
know our shadow palettes cuz uh that's
pretty expensive for a drugstore so
that's immediately what people are
saying
$30 what do you think do you think it's
worth it and will you buy it
of course honestly when I look at this
palette I feel extremely letdown and I
feel extremely frustrated that it's $30
now I have not seen it in person I'm
just seeing the photos of it but the
majority of the shades in there
look very small you know you get the two
concealers and their concealers in that
little pop pan form in a palette that
doesn't interest me those typically
never work for me you know so there's
that right away there's two lip balms
again I'm not a big bomb person and I
don't like them to be in a pilot because
then if I want to wear that out do I
have to bring the entire palette out
with me it just seems a little bit like
a headache and then you have your four
eyeshadows a blush a matte bronzer a
highlighter and I notice the blush the
bronzer and highlighter those are in the
vertical strips and immediately I'm
thinking it looks extremely difficult to
get your brush in there I mean
especially the blush it's like a tiny
little vertical row then you get a mini
mascara and then they do have these
brushes in there like one is a
double-ended brush it looks like a
blender brush on one end and then maybe
a flat shader brush on the other and
then what apparently is supposed to be a
contour brush I've looked at the
pictures of those as well and they look
very cheap but honestly on a whole when
I look at this I felt pretty
disappointed and I felt disappointed
that Maybelline's going to charge us $30
for this palette when I look at this
palette it and I don't want this to come
out the wrong way because I love
drugstore I've been buying drugstore for
so long and I love Maybelline Maybelline
is one of my OD brands
I own a ton from Maybelline I'm labeling
on my face today but when I look at that
it looks like one of those cheap
drugstore palettes that's what it looks
like to me and you're still gonna charge
us $30 that to me is really frustrating
I'm assuming it's because it's in
collaboration with Gigi Hadid is why the
price tag is happening and I really want
it to be like okay but you're getting
all of these different items and you
know yay but everything is so small in
the palette that I'm like it it just
doesn't really make a lot of sense to me
I know it's me I'd rather have a palette
with some bigger items items that I'm
actually going to be able to put my
brush into I won't be purchasing it
because I don't think that it's worth it
and I feel like I could go out and buy
even something high-end for what $10
more and I would be much more happier
with it and I feel like there's a lot of
items at the drugstore that are really
really good that are
way way more affordable than this one
maybe the quality inside is going to be
absolutely phenomenal and blow us away I
don't know
but to me I've tried a lot of Maybelline
eyeshadows and to me they are okay
so I've tried and I haven't been
impressed at all some I tried and I
thought were okay I tried one of the new
city of mini palettes from Maybelline
and I think it's okay so I just I don't
see how this is $30 other than Gigi has
to get paid so I think that's pretty
frustrating but that's just me
of course that's just my opinions that's
my first thoughts when I saw it again I
haven't played with it I haven't seen
any reviews of it so far I think it was
available as a platinum perk on Aalto so
if anybody did pick it up when it was
available as a platinum perk let us know
if you have any feedback I would love to
know those are your thoughts on the
palette do you think it's too much and
again this is just one palette in the
collection I haven't seen what the other
two collections are going to be maybe
something about those would spark my
interest a little bit more I don't know
but I honestly don't think so so that's
just me but let us know your thoughts as
well down below do you think $30 is too
much for Maybelline to be charging are
you happy with it you're fine with it
you think it's gonna be fantastic you're
gonna pick it up maybe you love Gigi I
don't just like Gigi not a celebrity I
follow a lot cuz I don't follow a ton of
celebrities anymore but I don't know
this one just fell really really flat
for me the next time I do have a holiday
release that I want to talk about I did
just recently post out part 3 and my
holiday makeup release is serious which
I call wish lists or one-touch they're
very similar to the lo-fi videos except
they're focused on all holiday releases
I will link the three videos that I have
down below I was going to talk about
this one in the video but I got a little
bit behind I had to pre film at that
video quite a few days in advance
because we were dog sitting over the
weekend
puppies sitting actually and I knew I
was not going to be able to film what I
was not able to film and so with that
one I wanted to watch some videos
because I saw more people who are
putting out renew videos and just
putting it in here I've been trying to
break up holiday releases versus regular
makeup releases but there's honestly
just so much holiday going on right now
that they're probably going to start
overlapping so there's just a lot to
talk about but of course with this one
it's the Fenty Beauty Holiday Collection
I was getting
so many questions on it is available now
and I'm looking at the Sephora app at
everything that is available by the way
the eyeshadow brush which is $24 I
wouldn't get it I have so many brushes I
don't I don't need a new sort of brush
like that so that's a no-go for me the
Eclipse two-in-one glitter liner it says
they have three different colors I
believe and it is a $20 for the liner
and says as a liquid eyeliner with the
transforming metallic to glitter formula
that lets you choose your own finish
that sounds very interesting
that sounds very intriguing but I don't
think that I would need this if you guys
don't know I'm not really into the
holographic trend which a lot of this
stuff is like holographic and like the
galaxy you know things like that and
that's not really my makeup vibes I saw
that Fendi beauty was coming out with
the galaxy collection and all the stuff
I mean I immediately kind of had my
thoughts put together but I thought I
would still you know try to watch
tutorials and review videos just to get
a better idea because you know maybe I
would be wrong but this isn't my
personal makeup vibes so I mean kind of
as a whole that's what I think at the
collection so the aligner when I do
anything for me the starlit hyper clicks
lipstick it's $19 and it is in four
different shades and it says it's a
metallic lipstick that's buildable to
the ultimate jewel chrome finish I don't
like metallic lipsticks I think I have
like one or two in my collection and I
barely reach for them because again not
my personal makeup vibes we have the
cosmic gloss lip glitter which is a $19
and it says limited edition glitter pact
a lip gloss that delivers the ultimate
triple threat of creamy color glitter
and shine again this is not something
that I wear on any sort of consistent
basis at all so I would not be buying it
because I would not be reaching for it
and honestly I was a little bit worried
to talk about Fendi beauty because
people get like personally offended when
people don't like Fanta beauty which is
very strange to me I don't I don't
really know why that is but watching you
know so many videos not even just on
Fendi beauty but I've been watching like
favorites and fails videos and if
anybody puts Fenty in a fail again
people are like personally offended I'm
like what why are we so upset
yeah honestly can't figure it out it's
very strange to me but the thing that
got the most requests the most tags on
the one that everyone kind of wanted to
see in this video or in the holiday
video was the galaxy eyeshadow palette
it's $59 at Flemington Edition it's a
glitter eyeshadow palette a 14 Stardust
it shades designed it to accessorize any
eye look
so this was the one that I wanted to pay
a little bit more attention to I didn't
want to just immediately write it off
just watch some videos see how the
eyeshadows work maybe it's something
that you will like really be into and
you know I try to be pretty open-minded
I honestly do my problem is that when I
was watching the different videos and
the different tutorials it's like
everybody is building this eye look
that's really beautiful with different
palettes and different single shades and
you know and then they're coming into
this palette for one shade and tapping
it up and being like and while I love
that and I think they're creating really
pretty looks and I you know that glitter
shade is really beautiful I don't need
that I don't need to go into a $59 a
limited edition pellet for one shade you
know when I think about the makeup looks
that I do I wouldn't need a palette like
this and if you are you know I die hard
Rihanna fan if you want everything from
Fenty beauty if you love glitter looks
and that's what you do like day in day
out those are your makeup vibes
why would you not consider getting this
palette I would totally understand that
but if you're someone like me who
doesn't do those types of looks a lot
you might have to stop and think do you
need that palette did touch on the Urban
Decay heavy metal holiday collection in
the holiday video and they have an
eyeshadow palette that looks really
really similar to this like very very
similar to this I think when I look at
the two and you know I said I was
skipping over it for the exact same
reasons as I'm skipping over this venti
Beauty one honestly a little bit
surprised that she came out with the
Holiday Collection it's so quickly after
the initial release that caught me off
guard I was not expecting it but I think
that's really cool and a lot of people
are very excited about it if it's your
vibes then you know think about it think
about if you want to buy it and
at the end of the day it's just makeup
it's also your money and you can do what
you want to do with it the same way that
I can do I want to do with mine but like
I mentioned in the beginning I'm going
to end with two fashion related items
but they both do have to do with beauty
influencers so the first one that I'm
going to talk about is with Casey Holmes
if you guys are not familiar with Casey
Holmes I'll have her YouTube channel
listed below she has over a million
subscribers and she was one of the first
channels that I started watching
I love pissy homes I feel like she is so
down-to-earth and relatable even for
someone with a million subscribers I
never miss a video from her I think it's
really intriguing to see what else it is
that beauty influencers are so
passionate about and what they are
interested in you know kathleenlights
with a kale polish now kissing homes
with her boutique I just think that's
really cool so like I said she did start
a clothing boutique it's called Rosie
day's boutique which i think is so cute
because I follow her on snapchat as well
of course her two dogs are rose and
Daisy so I thought the name Rosie days
boutique I thought that was from here
got some like dog themed items that were
available in her boutique like one says
dog mom and the O is a big little paw I
just thought that was super cute so when
I saw that she was watching the clothing
boutique I got super excited right away
I knew I wanted to order some items from
it and I I kind of wanted to mention
both of these items I'm gonna talk about
because I was talking about Casey Holmes
on my snapchat and people were saying
like what do you mean what is she what
is she doing I haven't heard anything
about this and I also mentioned it in a
YouTube live and I was watching the
comments come in and people write what
are you talking about what does Casey
Holmes doing and I was like how does
everybody know about this I'm going to
help spread the word I will link Rosie
days boutique the Instagram and then
also the website down below hey I'm
super bummed though because I was saying
this on my snapchat ad the day before
that I'm filming this video is one they
launched actually happened it was on
October 16th and I was there 40 minutes
after it launched which I had I had not
heard a launch time otherwise I would
have been there right at lunch time I
don't know if I just missed it if I
wasn't on my snapchat a lot over the
weekend because I was puppy sitting I
don't know if maybe it got announced
there and I just missed it somewhere but
I did not know and when I looked at her
a tweet because when I saw everything
was sold out on the boutique I went to
Casey's Twitter and I was 40 minutes
late I was like man because everything
sold out I think there's maybe I was
just looking at it this morning there's
like two items maybe that are still for
sale
but everything else sold out and I mean
I want it like sweater dresses I wanted
some of the tops in there I wanted the
dog mom sweater I was so excited I just
wanted to be able to support but not
only that fall is kind of the time where
I kind of revamp my wardrobe and buy
some new clothes so I was really excited
I've been saving for it you know I said
notice some makeup items because I knew
I wanted to get some clothing items and
I was just super pumped so I was
extremely bummed that I missed
everything did say on her Instagram and
on Twitter that they're going to be
restocking it very soon so I'll be
watching closely for when that date
comes around because I do I do want to
buy some stuff from the collection not
only to support Casey but to have cute
clothes in my closet I thought that's
pretty great usually in the fall too
because I know this is when I'm buying
clothes this is when I kind of go
through and declutter my closet and I've
already started I've been getting rid of
some of the items that I did not touch
at all in one year my hangers are still
on the opposite way you know I do that
hanger thing or you turn their hanger
around yeah there's still face in the
opposite direction from last fall says
not her clothing line like she did not
design these items you know she didn't
make them or things like that
what she does is that she buys wholesale
then she sells it in her boutique so
because I do have experience working in
a boutique I know that sometimes you
can't always get to the same items
because it depends on who you're getting
the wholesale from so I don't know if
she will always exactly have those those
same items and because I knew that that
was what I really wanted to get there
the day of the launch because I don't
know if all of these items will be
coming back and the turnover is usually
pretty high with boutiques but I don't
know her specific situation of course I
don't know what wholesalers she's
working with so I don't know that
information but she had so much cute
stuff the first time around I'm excited
to see what else is she brings in I will
definitely keep my eye on the restock
date and what else that she is coming
out with and the Rosie days a boutique
but I'd love to know did any of you guys
get anything from the first launch were
you able to grab anything
did you know that this was happening are
you excited do you follow Casey Holmes
and you want to support I would love to
know any thoughts that you have in the
comments down below but yes I'm super
excited about this one I will definitely
be buying hopefully in the near future a
nice fashion related I want to talk
about has to do with Carli bybel Carli
bybel is a huge beauty influencer here
on YouTube I don't even know maybe over
five million subscribers I think and she
is the very first very first youtuber
that I ever started watching though she
is coming out with a collaboration with
misguided now she did come out with a
collaboration with misguided I think it
was last year I bought quite a few of
the items and there and so when I saw
that she was coming out with another
collection with misguided I was like yes
I can't wait
and actually launched today of the day
that I'm filming and once again I had
not seen the launch time I even looked
at her Instagram yesterday I was trying
to see all it said was it launches
tomorrow and I'm like what time I woke
up and I was on Instagram it was about
7:15 a.m. and I saw on her Instagram
collection is live now launched at 7:00
a.m. and I was like oh no oh no and I
went to the website so fast but I'm so
excited because I got all of the pieces
that I wanted to get which I'm super
super stoked about so I will have you
know Carly's information and then also
the misguided website listen down below
in case you're interested in picking up
anything now these are items that Carly
did help designs a little bit different
than what Casey Holmes did with her
boutique it's a different you know style
that Carly is doing and not only that I
feel like Casey's boutique is kind of
for more like your average girl and this
collection that Carly is doing has a lot
of like has a lot of different items in
there but I'm excited because a few of
the pieces definitely did catch my
attention but said there's also going to
be a second drop of completely different
items happening in November so I'm
interested to see what will be in that
drop and fell want to purchase anything
in there to do a clothing haul and Tryon
coming up hopefully kissing homes the
restock will happen soon and I can get
some items because I would love to be
able to do a clothing haul with those
two together so we will see I wanted to
mention those two items because I was
getting quite a few tags on them and
getting asked if I had any
interest in them and if I would be
purchasing from them and I wasn't sure
how else to include it in a video so I
thought we could just kind of do a
little bit of everything in this week's
a will I buy a video but let me know
what you think about Carly's collection
wasn't misguided do you guys get
anything are you waiting for the
November launch let me know your
thoughts I would love to hear them and
what you decided to pick up if you did
okay so that's gonna do it for this
week's kind of all over the place a will
I buy a video I hope that you enjoyed it
I know it's a little bit different than
some of the other will i buy it's
because I mostly am just focusing on
makeup but like last week I talked about
nail polish to everything that I
mentioned will be a link down below and
as always I would love to know what you
thought of everything and that I chatted
about in here what are you getting what
are you passing over and of course what
do you want to see featured in next
