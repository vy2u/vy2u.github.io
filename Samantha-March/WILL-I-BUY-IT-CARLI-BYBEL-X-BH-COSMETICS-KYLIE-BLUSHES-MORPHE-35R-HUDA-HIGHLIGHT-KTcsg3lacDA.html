today's video is going to be a new oil i
buy it video where i am talking about a
few new makeup releases and letting you
know if i'm choosing to purchase them or
if i'm not been giving you some of my
reasons today's video is a little bit
difficult to make i'm actually filming
this the day after i'm returning from
vacation i mentioned in my last video of
that i was pre filling because I was
taking a road trip up to Colorado to
celebrate my 30th birthday we just got
home last night but I knew I needed to
film and get this video up for my will i
buy it wednesday so that's that and then
also well I was on vacation my Instagram
account disappeared she gone so I am
still trying to figure out what is
happening I'm trying to get help I would
recommend following me on snapchat which
is Samantha dot March or on Twitter
which is at by Samantha March those will
be in the description box down below
because I'm sharing more details over
there and really kind of asking you guys
for help and letting Instagram know that
something has gone wrong and to help me
get my count back I have no idea what
happened I don't think my account was
disabled because you get notification
when your account is disabled I don't
think my account was hacked I was able
to change my password I have no idea
what's going on I cannot get into my
Instagram account and it looks like my
page is completely gone and this
happened on Friday while I wasn't trying
to enjoy my birthday vacation hashtag
Instagram ruined my birthday and that's
what I keep putting on Twitter so I am
just kind of a mess right now I'm very
stressed to help I'm home from vacation
which is hard enough but then to have to
deal with all the instrument stuff is
very very difficult but I wanted to let
you guys know because I've been getting
a lot of comments on where's my
Instagram for a while it looked like I
was blocking people on Instagram people
were worried I was hacked and so I just
wanted to let you guys know I was trying
to respond to the comments as best as I
could while I was gone but I wanted to
let you guys know that there's that so I
feel like I look worse for wear I have
some eyeliner on and some lip gloss and
that was about the best that I could do
today and
it's just it's been it's been a rough
few days but I really do appreciate the
comments and the snaps and the tweets
you guys alerting me that something was
wrong
you guys trying to help me there's been
so many snaps coming in and tweets
coming in of you know trying to help me
get something figured out and I just I
appreciate it all so much so thank you
guys I hope that I can get my account
back but I don't know if I will if I
need to start over I will but the
situation I'm dealing with is actually
even more complicated than that I I
don't know maybe I'll do a full video
about it's a very confusing situation
that's happening right now but wanted to
let you guys know that but it's time to
make will I by Wednesday I need to jump
back into things so why don't we go
ahead and get started so the first item
that I want to talk about is a new
release upcoming a release from huda
beauty she is coming out with the 3d
highlighter palette there's gonna be two
different palette in the pink sands
edition and also the gold sands edition
it'll be available on April 17th on the
website which is a shop huge beauty each
palette includes a cream highlighter and
then also three powder highlights they
are each $45 these look really beautiful
I like huda beauty as a brand I really
love her Samantha lashes and I've
recently become very obsessed with her a
liquid lipsticks I have two different
shades and I absolutely love them I love
girl bosses boss babes I love that I
love supporting them which I definitely
think who they is I am NOT going to be
purchasing this though because I've said
it I think in last week's will i buy it
video I just have too many highlighters
right now I bought a lot of highlighters
recently so I can't really justify going
out and buying another highlight palette
it's just not going to work so I
definitely have to be on like a no Buy
in the highlight category right now it's
just not necessary for me right now so
even though they look really beautiful
I'll have the picture inserted in here
they look nice I'm not super obsessed
with cream highlights and I feel like I
have enough cream highlights for the
amount of time that I use them so like
the cream highlight doesn't really do
anything for me
and then the highlights like I said they
they look they look nice the
Eugene is really pretty and all that
good stuff it's just simply that I don't
feel like I need this I'm definitely not
a highlight junkie I love highlight I've
been highlighting more I have no
highlight on today because life but I
just I just don't need it
so I'm going to be passing over the
Buddha highlight pellets about let us
know in the comments down below
are you planning to pick one up both up
let us know I was getting a lot of
questions about the new morphia
eyeshadow palette that was recently
released it is the 35 are or the Ready
Set gold I think is what they were
calling the palette and I'll insert the
picture and here it's supposed to be a
part of the like 3 500 family I have 2 3
5 volt from morphe I have the 35 t from
morphe I love them both I believe the 35
palettes are 20 to 50 and this one just
like looked right up my alley golden
bronze brown dark shimmers a really
beautiful like gold shimmer in there I
mean it just looked like a super
stunning palette 22:54 35 eyeshadow
shades I think is a great price I like
more fees eyeshadows I use them a ton
there's also always like a discount code
floating around for more fees so many of
the big Beauty influencers have discount
codes where you can get 10% off so you
can save even a little bit more money I
really like morphe it's one of my
favorite brands I used their brushes
quite often and I am going to produce
this palette and I actually already did
purchased this palette I think I
purchased at the night before I left for
vacation or either the day we left which
was also my birthday I was like I do not
feel bad about this purchase so I have
purchased the morphe 35o palette let me
know do you guys want to see a first
impression video do you want to see a
swatch video do you want to see a
tutorial video let me know what you
would like me to do with the 35 our I'm
super excited to get it I just mentioned
in my makeup that I regret buying that I
didn't jump on at the morphe 25a or 25b
palace and I was really bummed out about
it but when the 35 are came out it kind
of looked like like maybe there was a
few similar shades between like the 25 a
and 25 B especially the gold that I was
really eyeing that I really have my
fingers crossed that I love it so when I
saw the 35
I was like I'm getting it and I didn't
even purchase this the day that it went
on sale I purchase it the next day and
it was still in stock I was like how is
this possible it has to be a sign but
this is neat it for me so I got the
palette and I also got a few brushes too
so I don't know maybe I'll do like a
haul video coming up or let me know what
you want to see for the palette I would
love to know but I'm super excited I was
really into this palette for all of the
reasons that I listed so I was excited
to purchase it but let me know in the
comments down below did you get the
palette are you still interested in it
did you pass over it
I will always love to know your feedback
sorry if it's getting darker it's
getting darker outside it looks like a
storm is about to come or some rain is
happening so sorry I'm gonna try to get
through this as fast as I can but the
next item that I wanted to talk about
was a new release from Kylie cosmetics
she's releasing single blushes for the
first time she's coming out with five
different shades they're all a matte
pressed powder and they are $20 each so
she has a range of colors from lights to
darks to like a nude blush looks like a
good range for different skin tones not
gonna be purchasing these I just I don't
love Kylie cosmetics and I'm not like
all about her that I know a lot of
people are a lot of people are big fans
of Kylie Jenner I totally get it
but I'm just not and I think if she were
to have a release that like really
excited me like maybe I would purchase
from her nothing is really getting me to
that like a level of excitement that I
need to actually make a purchase her
items are usually more expensive and you
can't return them if you don't like them
or they don't work out for you which
sucks I think usually she has her free
shipping now on orders over $40 but I
don't know I'm just not really drawn to
her I didn't totally love the packaging
on the blushes like the square type of
packaging I don't know it just seems a
little difficult for me I got to store
and things like that and I'm just not
really like a huge like passionate blush
person I don't even have blush on today
I have bronzer on today because I love
bronzer but I'm just not a big blush
person I can actually skip it in my
routine if I want to and I feel like I
have enough blushes and I have blush
palettes and you know all that kind of
stuff so it's just an item that I don't
think I need $20 for one blush is pretty
pricey you know I just spent $20 and got
35 eyeshadow
from morphe so it's like I'm gonna spend
$20.00 on a single blush
it just doesn't excite me enough Kylie
just doesn't really do a lot for me her
products are so hit and miss and so all
over the board like it's just you never
really know what you're gonna get from
Kylie cosmetics I'm like I said if you
don't like it you can't return it which
I think sucks for you no more expensive
makeup that's kind of like a big
downfall for me so I'm going to pass
over all of the blushes but as always
I'd love to know did you guys see the
blushes you were super excited about it
did you pick up any of the shades let me
know your thoughts okay I save the best
for last this is the one that I'm
getting the most questions on and it's
personally the one that I think I am
most excited to talk about in this
week's will I buy a video it is the new
palette from Carli bybel
and BH Cosmetics so Carli bybel she is a
major Beauty influencer I think she has
like 5 million YouTube subscribers she's
one of the very first youtubers that I
started watching I'm actually down to
Carli bybel made me buy it video she
teamed up with BH Cosmetics Inc was last
year and it came out with an eyeshadow
palette my mom actually bought me that I
should have held it for my birthday so I
have it it's an eyeshadow / highlight
palette it does have highlights in there
as well but can kind of intermix them
I've used the highlights as eyeshadows
I've used some of the eyeshadows as
highlights vice versa and I have only
had really good things to say about the
eyeshadow palette I adore it I reach for
it very often it's super easy to travel
with
I loved the shades in there I was very
very happy with my purchase at speech
cosmetics which is a more affordable
brand which i think is amazing and I
just thought it was super cool and
really to me showed me like how
down-to-earth Carly really is that she
teamed up with BH Cosmetics and I
appreciate it so much had a great time
with that palette it was going to be a
limited edition palette I watched
Carly's video she does have a video all
about the palette which I'll leave
linked in the description box down below
as well in case you want to watch it and
Carly was saying that the palette was
supposed to be limited-edition and they
got such a good response on it that they
decided to come back and make like a
deluxe edition of the eyeshadow palette
so it's just like a bigger eyeshadow and
highlight palette and I am really really
excited about it I actually watched the
video in the car as we were driving back
from Colorado
because I just was super excited to see
it and see you inside of it
so it's gonna be 21 shades in total the
original palette has 14 shades there's
going to be 59 shadows and also six
highlighters the palette will include a
few of the favorite of Carly's favorite
shades from the original palette and
then there are seven new eyeshadows and
three new highlighters and in her video
she does go over what is from the
original palette and then what is from
the new palette so if you have the
original palette and you like it enough
like the shades are enough for you you
might not need the deluxe edition you'd
really have to look and see what shades
are in the new one that you don't have
in the old one and see if it's like
that's what you want that's how I would
do it anyways it does have a mirror
which is a fantastic and then she said
in her video that the price for the
first 30 days is going to be nineteen
fifty which i think is fantastic and
then the regular price after that it is
going to be 2250 the palette is vegan
and cruelty free as Carly is as well
it'll be out April 3rd online at BH
Cosmetics and she did mention in her
video that the palette will be releasing
on uLTA Beauty sometime in the next few
months or so they didn't have an exact
date on that uLTA Beauty just recently
started carrying BH Cosmetics which i
think is really exciting so we'll see
the palette in stores and online at some
point but the first 30 days you get a
better price on it and the only place
that you'll be able to get it when it
first releases is going to be the BH
website and again that will be April 3rd
once that palette does release the
original palette is going to be
discontinued so if you think that you
want the original palette
I know it's available I've seen it in my
auto stores I've also seen it on Ulta
online if it is still available at the
time that I go to put the video up and I
can still find a link for it I'll leave
it listed down below because as of April
3rd that palette then will be
discontinued ok so I think that's
everything about the palette and that I
have to say I'll put the photos in here
I'll try to get as many of the best
photos that I can I was trying to take
screen grabs from her video as well and
hopefully I can find some good ones to
put in there I'm super excited about
this palette I love Carly like I said
she's one of my favorite beauty
influencers
I really enjoyed her first pallet and I
definitely do want to pick me up the
deluxe edition I love the packaging I
love what the shades look like inside
the new shades have me like totally
shook as she mentioned in her video that
they also amped up the pigmentation on
all of the shades so even if you have
the original the original shades that
are in the new palette are supposed to
be even better I really really hope to
get my hands on this palette and then
maybe I can do a video on it and then
also share with you guys you know what
the original shades look like - the new
shades and you know if I really do think
the pigmentation is better and that type
of thing let me know if you'd be
interested in that but this is
definitely something that I'm going to
try to purchase like this honestly might
be something that like I set my alarm to
so I can buy it right away on April 3rd
I don't know if it'll sell out my guess
is that it probably will so I really do
want to try to get my hands on this
because I'm super excited about it the
eyeshadow shades looked so beautiful to
me there's this like pink shade in there
that totally caught my eye the golds and
there's like a burnt orange copper
shades like I just I'm really excited
there's also some really beautiful mauve
shades in there too and it just excited
me um the highlights that are in there
they look really beautiful as well but
like I said you can wear them as
eyeshadows like honestly if this was
just an eyeshadow palette I'd buy it
anyways I think it's cool that we get
some highlights not that I need the
highlights like I said but you know
overall this is mostly an eyeshadow
palette and I definitely want to pick it
up I think for 20 dollars like I don't
know how you beat that price that is
such an amazing price it is super
affordable and I just think that is so
so very cool I am obviously super
excited for this palette if you can't
tell I I was so excited watching her
video I smiled the whole time my friends
were like what are you doing over there
and I'm like you wouldn't understand you
know but I'm just I'm I'm excited for it
I can't wait so I definitely plan on
picking up this palette fingers crossed
that I can get it if I don't get it
right away I'm sure that it will come
back in stock and I'll be able to get it
and you know this is one that I still
want to pick up regardless even if I
don't get it right away I still would
want to have it in my collection and to
be able to support one of my favorite
youtubers I think it's a really cool way
that we're able to you know support the
people that we watch so often and you
know feel like we really have a connect
with so I think that would be really
specialist so let me know in the
comments down below are you guys excited
for this one are you a big supporter of
Carly like myself or is this one that
you think that you can pass over maybe
you have the original you think you
don't need it I always love to know your
thoughts I read and respond to all the
comments I know I'm a little bit behind
right now but I've been in the Colorado
for the past five days and the whole
deal with Instagram has definitely got
me really behind but mark my words I
will get caught up one of these days I
will be caught up on my comments and I
just really loved interacting with you

with each other it's really cool to see
so much positivity and conversation on
