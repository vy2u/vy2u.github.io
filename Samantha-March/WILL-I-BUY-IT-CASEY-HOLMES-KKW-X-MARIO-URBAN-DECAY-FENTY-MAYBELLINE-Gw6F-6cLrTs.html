today's video it's going to be a new
Villa bias I post my beloved videos
every single Wednesday chatting about
some new makeup releases and launches
letting in a little bit about them and
then talking over if I'm planning to
pick them up or if I'm going to pass
over them and as always I have less chat
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started are you so kicking it
off I got quite a few tags on this new
palette from Maybelline it is called the
lemonade crazed eyeshadow palette I'm
looking at the trend with one Instagram
so I'll have her page linked in my
description box as I normally do it says
it's available now to pre-order on
Amazon and it'll ship on April 13th
looks like it's going to be 10 at 99 and
then it says it'll be available for all
US retailers in May and June ok so this
looks like a pretty interesting palette
I'll of course have the photo insert it
in here but I'm not gonna like like when
I heard the name lemonade I guess I was
expecting more than like one yellow in
there I mean I at least thought like two
yellows would be cool and I feel like
there was a time it was like two weeks
ago I was really trying to do a yellow
eye look I had this eye look in mind
that I really wanted to do and I was
pulling yellows from the palettes that I
had and I could not get like that
perfect like bright lemonade yellow and
I was getting super frustrated and so I
don't I feel like when you get a palette
that has yellow in it it's one yellow
that's all you get so when I was like oh
lemonade palette I was like oh that's
gonna at least have more than one try to
get nope it's just the one yellow so
it's kind of like letdown and I mean I
understand you know there's pink
lemonade and things like that so there's
more like Pink's in here and there is
one really like fun like like bright
pink that I think is really cool looking
but I don't I'm just a little bit
disappointed because I wish there would
have been maybe a little bit more color
in there to go along with the lemonade
name but to me it actually still really
does look interesting like I said I like
the Pink's in there I'm looking at the
swatches it looks like there's kind of
like a fun orange and there also and
then plenty of like neutrals which is
great because you know I do like my
neutrals it's only $10.99 which I don't
think is about price it
Maybelline eyeshadows are that hit or
miss for me when they were coming out
with their city mini palettes I think it
was like they were good but it wasn't
anything that like knocked my socks off
by any means but I still thought it was
pretty decent so I'm kind of like going
back and forth on this one I'm not like
it's calling to me I did a double-take
there's parts of it that you know I wish
for a little bit different maybe some of
the colors were a little bit different
but it's still kind of calling out to me
and you know $11 isn't terrible I'm just
worried because I feel like I keep
buying some of these drugstore palettes
and I'm being let down by them so this
is one that I'm not 100% sure about but
it did catch my attention for sure and I
do like the colors inside but let me
know what you guys think about this
Maybelline lemonade one is it something
that you would like to see me use in an
upcoming video or review or you're just
not interested in it maybe you felt the
same way about me like with the color
selection I just wish there was like a
little bit a little bit more in there
but you know price Boise isn't bad and
the colors do look fun and really cool
for spring/summer so that is a new
release from Maybelline so if any Beauty
has a new release and I'm not gonna lie
I got really excited when I got tagged
on this on-trend mood because the first
thing that I saw it's a glowing skin and
I was like yes if nd beauty is coming
out with like a luminous or a dewy
foundation like that's personally what
I've been waiting for from the brand I
tried the first foundation that they
came out with and it just didn't work
for me it's not my vibes it was too mad
on me it was too full coverage so I was
like yes yes he has a new foundation
that's not an adult he's coming out with
the fairy bomb it says it's a pompom
packed with shimmer so I'll try to
include the best photos that I can it's
42 dollars but basically it's like a
body shimmer and then also body Lama
lava Lama a body Lama who seemed up
before the body lava which is a body
Luminizer in two different shades for
$59 each and then also a kooky brush for
$34 these are just items that I'm not
interested in at all but I never used on
like a body shimmer very rarely use it I
know a big thing especially in like
summer is to like highlight like your
collarbones and your shoulders and stuff
I almost always forget that like I
remember
sure I was like oh it's gonna be
highlighted my whole body everywhere
like everybody else in these videos now
I pretty much never do that I highlight
my face and then I move on with my life
so that wouldn't be an interest to me
and then the body lava which is a body
Luminizer again it's just not something
that I use I have other ones in my
collection that's like a just in case
I'm going to use this at some point and
I very rarely if ever reach for them so
I know that there's definitely a market
for them I know people for sure use
these types of products but for me
personally it's just not something that
I use I'm so bummed because I really
really thought it was going to be a
foundation but I'll keep waiting I'll
keep waiting for fancy Beauty to launch
that glowy a foundation but let me know
what you think about these new releases
are these right up your alley are you
like me and it's just just not something
that you're interested
bourbon decay is coming out with more
new releases I feel like urban decay is
doing a lot lately like they're doing
the most they doin the most over here so
urban decay is coming out with the
beached Summer 2018 collection it looks
like they're extending their mat Beach
bronzers to a whole collection reading
again from the turn mood one Instagram
so they're kind of reap remoting their
Beach two bronzers and bronzed and
sunkissed I have these bronzers and it's
one of my favorites I really do enjoy it
for looking for a good bronzer I would
recommend these and then they're also
coming out with the beached eyeshadow
palette which is $34 and then more
lipsticks which are $18 I actually do
have an urban decay lipstick on today
it's like I'm Fuego I think it is loving
this lipstick I love their urban decay
lipsticks I would highly recommend them
they're also coming out with more 24/7
glide-on eye pencils $20 each I think
those are amazing but and I would
recommend those for sure but really what
I want to talk about for this one is the
beach I showed up Alex I felt like that
was that is what I was getting the most
tags on says it'll be available in May
8th online uLTA Beauty and may 10th in
stores so the action of palette $34 it
looks really cool I just I really like
Urban Decay eyeshadow palettes I feel
like I really like their vibe I feel
like I really like a lot of the new
releases that they come out with and not
only that but I actually really like a
ton of the products I realized I went
traveling over Easter we stayed up by my
in-laws and as I was unpacking my
back when I was getting ready to do my
makeup on Sunday morning I was like I
packed almost all over and again Oh
would you look at that not even reading
to do it or anything I just packed a
whole lot of Urban Decay but this
palette definitely looks really pretty
it has these beautiful blues in there
that immediately caught my attention I
like the packaging on it $34 I don't
think it's going to be a bad price and I
have to say that I'm definitely very
interested in this one the blue is
definitely have caught my attention I
know that I have other blues in my
collection though so it's kind of one of
those things that's like do you really
need the palette girlfriend $34 I I
don't think that's a bad price the
packaging looks similar to the backtalk
palette which my review is coming very
soon it looks similar to the backtalk
pellet except it doesn't have the face
shades in there so I honestly don't
think $34 is a bad price and ah I'm
interested in this one I really like
kind of that deep teal in there too and
that is a color that I do like to wear
blues can sometimes you know they can be
hard to work with but like at that deep
teal I really do like this is one where
I'm just feeling the vibes I did the
double take right away still it's still
got my attention and I just feel like I
have a table up for Urban Decay and I
just really enjoy so many of their
products and releases so mmm it's not
available until May which is kind of a
bummer because I know the vib sale is
coming up here I think we finally just
got the dates announced over the weekend
I wish it kind of would be a part of it
but Urban Decay also seems to go on sale
a lot but again I also don't think $34
is a bad price for an urban decay
eyeshadow palette so I'm definitely very
interested in this one I'd love to know
what do you guys think were you excited
over it are you kind of like urban decay
you're coming out with a lot sometimes
when brands come out with too much I'm
like well well let us like let us enjoy
the makeup let us enjoy it but they
Lerner's the brand that has my attention
so I'm interested in that one so next
time I did get quite a few tags on the
collaboration with k'kaw and makeup by
Mario so I thought I would chat about it
I don't normally talk about k'kaw beauty
because it's just not a brand that I
support and I've said that in past video
so I feel like it kind of gets too
repetitive but I know a lot of people
are very excited for this the
collaboration I think makeup by Mario is
someone who is very loved in the beauty
industry so I thought I would mention
I thought I'd give my thoughts on it
k'kaw booty it's just not really my vibe
I don't know how that's really all I'm
gonna say because I have talked about it
in the past but I wasn't really
interested to see what the collaboration
would be make it by mario has been Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist for a very
long time so I thought it was really
cool but they were doing a collaboration
together so I was interested in it and
then I'm just gonna talk about the
eyeshadow palette I know they're also
coming out with some lipsticks and high
shine lip glosses but the eyeshadow
palette has ten eyeshadows and also a
mirror it says the inspiration behind
the choice of shades is the looks and
Mario has created over the last 10 years
including the blue color where he used
it on Kim in the past to break her every
day choice of color and try something
different it's gonna be $45 and it'll be
available April 5th online at the kkw
Beauty website so I'm not gonna lie this
was one of those where I was like maybe
if I'm super interested in this palette
I would purchase it but one day it came
out and I saw the photos of it I was
like oh no I just I feel like it's
really easy for me to say like I have
all of these shades in here again you
know there's that pop a balloon there
which is really beautiful and just like
I was saying what like at the Urban
Decay palette I've know that I have that
blue in there in my collection already
so I'm just kind of like I don't feel
like I need this and I don't feel like
it's really something that's different
enough for me to spend the $45 on and
I'm sure you have to pay shipping on the
k'kaw website so it would probably be
over $50 in the end you know and I'm not
trying to say that that's a bad thing
either because I feel like Kim
Kardashian has her normal makeup looks
and I feel like this palette really does
embody that so the palette makes sense
to me but it doesn't make sense for me
to purchase and to have in my collection
so I am gonna pass over it but I know
like I said I've been seeing a lot of
people talk about this one and a lot of
people were excited and even like I've
talked to people who are like me who
don't necessarily who don't necessarily
support k'kaw Beauty but they're like I
love makeup by Mario and I would love to
purchase that palette so and that's kind
of where I was but you know it's not to
the point where like I absolutely have
to have it
or what it was if it's not something
that I feel like I'm gonna get a ton of
use out of and it's gonna be more pricey
than I would prefer to spend I'm just
not gonna do it so that's what I feel
about this pallet it just didn't get me
quite excited enough and I just you know
I feel like I can say that I have others
like this in my collection I also felt
like it looked really similar to a Kylie
palette I'm pretty sure right doesn't it
look similar I didn't look at and I look
up and see what palette it was but I'm
like fairly certain maybe like a
vacation palette or something that Kylie
cosmetics did I think maybe it's just
that blue though that's maybe is what's
triggering that thought process but it
just didn't do enough for me and I'm
just not going to be interested enough
in it but I think the collaboration is
cool I think the palette makes sense for
what it is and all of that it just
doesn't interest me but I'd love to know
where you like this is something I
absolutely have to have
do you love k'kaw beauty I would love to
hear about anybody's experiences with
purchasing from the brand I just you
know I watch a lot of the review videos
as well and it just seems like there's a
lot of misses out there I know it's a
newer brand and everything but this
one's just not gonna be for me so I'm
gonna go ahead and skip over that one
and then the final item that I want to
talk about is one that I was so excited
about so this is a collaboration with
Casey Holmes a youtuber and Palladio a
beauty so we have kind of known that
Casey Holmes was doing a new collab
she'd been dropping hints about it and I
was really excited for it I bought her
smashbox collab the pearl palette still
one of my favorite highlight palettes I
think it's fantastic and so when I saw
that she was getting ready to come out
with a new collab I was super pumped it
is with Palladio beauty which I'm not
gonna lie I don't have anything from
Pilate Oh beauty I feel like it's a
brand I hear a ton about believe it's
also sold at Sally Beauty and is a more
affordable brand and she came out with
three liquid lipsticks with them the
shades are in Georgia rescue and
obsessed and they are each $10 apiece
and so it says it will be available at
Claudia beauty it is available now and
then also at Sally beauty stores so I
love Casey Holmes that she's one of my
favorite youtubers she's one of the
first youtubers that I ever started
watching absolutely adore her channel I
love her dolls and all of that so I just
get really excited when some of my
favorite people people that I love to
support
come out with collaborations so I was
ready when her video post it
I watched it right away and then I went
and I purchased all three right away on
the plot II website you do get free
shipping on orders over $30 each of the
liquid lipsticks are $10 I'm just $30 so
I got free shipping and they should be
here soon I've already gotten the
shipping confirmation it from it so I
should have those soon when I was
watching her video these looked like
really interesting liquid lipsticks and
like I said I'm not familiar with
Palladio beauty but I was like is this a
new formula that they did or what
because it sounds super interesting to
me when she put him on it really did
look like a gloss and she said it was
really comfortable and easy to apply but
it dry sound completely matte its
transfer proof PopSugar was a PopSugar
did an article about it that I was
reading about and the person who was
right in the article said how completely
long-lasting they are lasted through
food and eating and all-day wear and all
of this and I'm like what if this look
with lips a formula so fantastic how
come I ever heard more about it so I
wasn't sure if the formulas new but I'd
love to know if you guys are super
familiar with Apple audio Beauty but
like I said I already purchased all
three I purchased them right away just
something that I was really excited
about it'll be a new brain for me so
I'll be interested to see how I like it
but it sounded like these liquid
lipsticks are just supposed to be
totally the balm and Casey's highlight
palette again with Smashbox was
fantastic so I feel like I don't know I
feel like she's not gonna steer us wrong
so I'm just so excited I'm so excited
for her I love the names I loved all the
tones in there the only one that I was
thinking like oh maybe I should get that
one was obsessed because it's more of
like a brighter they call it a rich
berry but I do like that stuff that I do
like that summer I do like that color in
the summertime and I know that I wore it
last summer so I'm like well as we're
getting into the warmer months I'm kind
of more into that kind of shade so I was
like I'm just gonna go ahead and order
all three I'm just too excited about it
so I place my order so I will have them
soon and I can do a review and let you
know what I think but I'd love to know
where you guys so excited when you saw
this collab do you watch a Casey Holmes
as well or this is something that you're
like I'm not interested in like a look
at what lipsticks maybe you're not a fan
of the brand I don't know but I was
really excited for it a big congrats to
take Casey homes and yeah I'm super
pumped to get my liquid lipsticks but
that was
I was just I I feel like I definitely
bought it because of the collaboration
but also because I do like the shades
and I am a big liquid lipstick wearer so
I'm excited to try out a new formula but
after that that's gonna do it for this
