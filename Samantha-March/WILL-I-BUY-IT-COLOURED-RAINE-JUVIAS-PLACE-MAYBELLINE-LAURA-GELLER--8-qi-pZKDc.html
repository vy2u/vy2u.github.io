today's video is going to be a new logo
I buy it I plus my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know
complaining to pick them up or pass over
them per usual I have a lot to chat
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started
alright I thought it was funny I had my
list and ready to go and then just this
morning Alice and I kept getting tagged
on this one specific product and it
wasn't even a newer post on the tread
mood on Instagram which will be listed
in the description box coz I read a lot
from her and sometimes use the photos
and stuff so I always have her listed
but all of a sudden kept getting post on
it was something from three days ago and
I wasn't just this morning and I'm like
what what's going on here and it's
because it is a new release from Laura
Geller and I just mentioned laura geller
in yesterday's video which was eight
brands I want to train in 2018 so that
video went up in the morning and the
next thing you know a lot of you guys
are tagging me on instagram which thank
you because I didn't even see this post
I didn't know that this release was out
there I completely missed it so but
that's your tags I wouldn't even know
this was out there so I decided to add
this one in here instead just because
the number of posts that were coming in
this morning so laura geller
is releasing a new baked gelato swirl
illuminator trio palette okay it is
available now at Ulta Beauty I did check
it it's available on the site it's $35
for three different shades which is a
French physics a pearl on the molten
copper and these aren't the baked gelato
swirl highlights which when I was
talking about it in the aprons video I
was saying you know I kind of feel like
I would mostly hear about the Laura
Geller highlighters especially the
gilded honey you know everybody was
always wearing gilded honey so I just
thought it was really interesting to see
this new trio palette come out and they
look to be you know just a little bit
smaller in size I think looking at the
photos and comparing them to the you
know the regular singles of the
highlights but you know obviously even
when you have a smaller highlight it's
just so hard to go through a single
highlight I don't think I've ever gone
through this and go highlight ever I
don't even know if I've hit pan on a
single highlight I mean
maybe for the my highlights that shatter
but you know does that really count I
don't think it does so I'm $35 for three
I don't think it's bad because I think
for the one highlight it's like $24 it's
in like the mid
when he arranged for one single
highlight which is why I was saying in
my trans video like that's kind of why I
didn't purchase them like I've had
gilded honey in my hand before and I put
it back because I thought it was too
expensive so I definitely did the double
take when I saw the trio I was like wait
a second there's a really cool pink in
there and a really cool what looks to be
like a gold highlight but then there's
one that looks you know probably that's
gonna be too dark for my skin tone so I
would probably really only be able to
get two uses out of it and I don't know
the pink it's called pixie pearl so it
makes me think you know pearl like a
pinky pearl type of color but I'm not a
hundred percent that would be my
favorite I feel like it's been more
adventurous lately with my highlights I
know the you know you're a decent trend
is like really popping right now and I
was kind of like a little I don't know
if I would like that as a highlight but
I actually have been liking them a bit
but I still don't I don't know for sure
that all three I would really get a lot
of use up I'm not sure if it would be a
great idea to buy a trio so I think I'm
gonna just hold off on this one for
right now I also am purchasing the Urban
Decay highlight palette that I've been
talking about the Sephora sale the 25
off 50 for Rouge members starts on
Thursday I think it is so I really
didn't feel like the Sephora black
friday cyber monday deals were all that
crazy so i didn't make a purchase from
them then but I just saw actually trend
mood posted that the 25 off 50 is
starting Thursday so if you haven't seen
that information yet that is coming I
know a lot of you guys were asking me
wondering if that was gonna happen again
and that's what I'm going to buy the
Urban Decay highlight palette so I know
I have another highlight palette coming
so I don't think I need to purchase
another one at this time but thank you
guys for the tags that's awesome I still
think one of these days I'm gonna try me
out some gilded honey but for the trio
for Laura Geller I'm gonna go ahead and
pass over it so Maybelline have recently
just came out with a whole bunch of new
items and I was getting a lot of tags
both on Instagram also a lot of types
came in on Twitter they just released a
whole bunch of stuff so I'm looking at
the Ulta website looks like they came
out with a few more colors of their
master holographic prismatic highlighter
which is $9.99 they also came out with a
new like kind of Beauty Blender it's
called the face studio blender so it's a
makeup sponge for $5.99 they came out
with a
hydrate and smooth face primer for 9.99
they came out with the total temptation
at mascara 949 also the total temptation
eyebrow definer pencil $7.99 they came
out with new lipstick colors which are
749 a new foundation which I think the
foundation was the one I was getting the
most tags on that's called the super
stay full coverage foundation for $11.99
also the lasting drama light eyeliner
for $5.99 a lip Studio Python metallic
lip kit for $9.99 the City cheeks all in
one eye and cheek palette for $11.99 and
also the total temptation eyes shadow
and highlight palette for 1199 I think
that was the second thing I was getting
the most tags on so I'll just kind of
touch really briefly on these um the
highlighter I wouldn't purchase I don't
feel like I need it you know especially
since I just said I was buying the Urban
Decay and I also have one of their the
like master chrome highlight and
honestly I have to try it a few more
times but it's just not really my
favorite it doesn't really call to me
the Beauty Blender I'm like someone
interested in but I just don't think I
need it right now I would need to throw
away some of my other blenders before I
really felt like I needed a new one a
primer I just recently got a new primer
that I love that I'll talk about in my
makeup monthly so I don't feel like I
need a new primer the mascara don't need
a new mascara I recently did a mascara
declutter and I still kept away too many
mascaras I did actually go ahead and
order the total temptation eyebrow
definer pencil for $7.99 I don't know
I'm just I'm interesting to me I follow
Maybelline on snapchat and they do some
tutorials or like beauty influencers
will do the Takeovers on there and do
tutorials and I've seen a few I'm using
the eyebrow pencil and I just thought I
would give it a try I'm I'm more
comfortable with eyebrows lately I was
kind of a late bloomer with eyebrows but
I'm more comfortable with them now and I
like trying out different things I
actually I'm trying out a new broad
pencil to me on my eyebrows today and I
like trying new things and seeing you
know what works for me and what doesn't
work for me and this one looks kind of
similar to the goof proof where it has
like the teardrop shape tip so I and I
feel like I can get the hang of the goof
proof pretty well so we'll see how this
one works I think I want to do kind of
like testing new drugstore makeup I just
got some things from ELF and also sleek
makeup and so I thought I could get a
couple of these Maybelline products so
I'll try out the eyebrow
pencil coming up here shortly power
matte lipsticks I don't feel like I need
any lipsticks I ordered I ordered some
lipsticks as well I will be doing like a
Black Friday Cyber Monday haul when I
get all of my orders in I ordered
lipsticks sets in there as well so the
super-safe full coverage foundation for
$11.99 I did go ahead and order that as
well along with the eyebrow pencil so
I'll be trying that in you know the
testing new drugstore makeup I really
like foundations I'm kind of on a
foundation caper right now and I don't
know it just seemed interesting to me
I'm full coverage kind of scares me a
little bit full coverage isn't like my
absolute favorite I'm more of like
medium coverage but I thought I could
give it a try I do like some of
Maybelline's foundations I really liked
D better skin foundation so I'm excited
to try this one and just give it a try
and see what it's like 1199 you know I
didn't think that was a bad price and
then I know I had like a 350 coupon and
that Altan usually does and I got six
percent cash back at Ebates because I
ordered on Black Friday so that was
awesome so I figured I'd go ahead and
give it a try they were actually sold
out of the color that I wanted so I went
with I think like a color lighter maybe
since we're approaching winter so I was
like oh maybe it'll work I don't know
we'll see but I did purchase that one so
we'll try it out pretty soon the
eyeliner I'm not super interested in a
plenty of eyeliners I also kept a lot in
my eyeliner declutter the metallic lip
kit wouldn't be for me I got a metallic
lip person and I'm also not like a lip
kit lip palette type of girl so I would
pass over that the all-in-one Iron Sheik
palette for $11.99 I'm gonna pass over
it I'm just not really a fan of these
palettes because you know Maybelline
kind of have this with the Gigi Hadid
collection too we're like each of the
pan sizes are like really tiny and I'm
like how do you put your brush in that
and I feel like I don't know I feel like
things would kind of be going everywhere
the powder would be going in the other
powder and some of the shades in there
too like just don't really scream out at
me so I'm gonna pass over that one the
eyeshadow and highlight palette it did
catch my attention I did a double-take
over there like kind of considered you
know should I purchase it along with the
foundation and the eyebrow pencil but I
don't feel like it gave me a strong
enough pull again the pan sizes are
small so you would have to use like tiny
brushes take it into the majority of
but it just didn't it wasn't speaking to
me enough and you know I have new high
light pellets coming to me so it's kind
of like I don't know what to do you know
twelve dollars isn't terrible for the it
looks like there's ten different shades
in there but I don't know it just didn't
call my attention enough decided to go
ahead and pass over that one but I know
like I said I think that was the one
that was getting like the second most
tags about so I would love to know if
you guys purchase that or if you
purchased anything from this new
Maybelline total temptation collection
what caught your attention do you guys
like the idea of me doing the you know
full face first impressions of drugstore
makeup let me know in the comments
because if nobody wants to see that
video then you know I definitely don't
have to post it I can just do a fuse
later on but I thought maybe that could
be a fun one to do and I have some new
drugstore makeup here so those are the
items that I picked up from the
Maybelline total temptation collection
let us know what you got let me know if
you liked that video idea so next I
might have a new eyeshadow palette from
dubious place to chat about this is
called the they'll say eyeshadow palette
not 100% I'm saying that right has 9
different shades in there I did check of
the dubious place website before filming
it was still available on the website
and it was $21.50 I know there's a ton
of dubious place codes out there as well
I think mostly for like 10% off so
always use the code if you want to save
a little bit of money there but I was
getting quite a few tags on this one
kind of my first thought when I looked
at it was that the colors are super
interesting I feel like this way with a
lot of dubious lies palettes so like I
feel like they have such interesting
color combinations and concepts and
their eyeshadow palettes like I don't
know you know how a lot of times with
eyeshadow palettes has like you know a
cohesive color arrangement in there not
juvey is like they're like we're doing
whatever we want to do we're gonna put
one of the colors we want here I think
that's super cool and interesting but it
takes me it takes my mind a minute when
I look at one of their eyeshadow
palettes it kinda has to be like okay
how would I use this this palette again
but I just kind of find that interesting
with Julia's place does anybody else
think that with some of their pellets I
do own the masquerade mini eyeshadow
palette from them and honestly like I
feel like they're I shadow and their
quality of their eyeshadows is so
freakin bomb like so good whenever I use
that map
great many like I know that I really not
even gonna have to put a lot of work
into using that palette because
everything just shows up so well so
vibrant it's crazy like they have really
really good eye shadows a four shirt so
but looking at this one you know I do
want to preface and say I've gotten a
lot of eyeshadow palettes recently and
I've I've kind of become overwhelmed I'm
trying to get through everything and
trying to review everything like there's
just a lot happening right now I'm
definitely very overwhelmed you know I
read all the comments as well and I see
you guys saying to you like how you're
so overwhelmed I just ordered the last
week I was talking about the color pop
all I see is magic eyeshadow palette I
just ordered that one as well like
they're just there's a lot happening
right now a lot a lot going on so with
that in mind like I feel like it looks
like a pretty cool palette and the
colors look neat and I'm sure the color
payoff is gonna be fantastic but I'm
just going to have to skip over it right
now because I just got I just cut too
much I just got too much going on and if
something isn't uh you know this
definitely made me do the double tank
but if it's just not like pulling like I
feel like I'm gonna cry myself to sleep
if I don't get this palette type of
thing then I have to say no to it
because I just got too much going on
right now I have so many review videos
coming up because I have so much to
review and I keep getting comments like
when are you reviewing that I showed up
hello what are you reviewing that
highlight palette I'm like it's coming
it's coming because I also have to you
know try everything several times before
I can review it and I'm just like oh
there's so much going on I mean it's
like the worst problem ever to have oh
no makeup must try but like I really do
want to be able to get there
everything's I can get my reviews up and
all of that so I want to pass over it
but honestly 2154 the nine shades in
there and they you know what the dubious
place eyeshadow palettes are normally
quite large I feel like that's really
good you can probably use the code to
get even more money off I don't feel
like that's a bad price at all maybe if
there was kind of like a less happening
right now and I kind of was buying a
little bit less
I totally would have gone for it but I
just I'm gonna say no I'm gonna say no
last time but let us know do you have
Allah Julius placed eyeshadow palettes
do you love them are you a collector
alright are you gonna get this one so
the last one that I want to talk about
has been on my list for a while the
child
these are from a coloured raine and
these are there are many eyeshadow
palettes I've had this on my list to
talk about for a while and I talked
about coloured raine and yesterday's
video as well the eight brands I want to
try because I've never tried anything
from color brain yet and a lot of people
brought up these eyeshadow palettes so I
thought it could be a good time at to
mention these as well
so they came out with these new mini
eyeshadow palettes each one has six
different shades in there and they all
have you know kind of like a certain
theme to them so there's Beauty rust
lovelyz smoke show and then very cute
and they are thirty-six dollars a piece
now honestly I'm kind of mad at myself
because they're thirty-six dollars for
six shades and I thought that was pretty
pricey they went on sale for like twenty
seven dollars I want to say during Black
Friday and I had I had the berry one in
my cart right yes the berry one very
cute I had in my cart and I had hit
check out and I had entered all of my
information and that it was like six
dollars for shipping and all of this and
I searched around for a while I was
trying to find a coupon code you guys
know I mean I just did the video of like
makeup I don't want to pay full price
for I always been trying to find some
sort of discount and I know that it was
already discounted from the $36 but I
think I still felt like 36 was too much
for a 6 pan eyeshadow I think that they
should have been $27 so then I wanted a
discount on top of the $27 you guys have
just being honest with how my mind works
and then I was paying for like the six
dollars shipping on top of it I was like
I don't know this is a good idea I
bought a lot for Black Friday Cyber
Monday not only for me I got a new
giveaway coming up soon which I'm super
super hyped to do but I've been buying a
lot for that and of course holiday time
my husband and I went shopping the other
day and went to like three different
stores buying for like family members
and friends and all of that and it's
just a lot it's a lot so when I was
getting ready to purchase it I was like
it was like all of my other purchases
were swirling through my mind I'm like -
ching ching ching ching ching was all
swirling in there and I was like do I do
it do I do it do I do it and I backed
out and literally this morning like
before I was filming and anything I was
like I think I should become ed I shadow
palette maybe they're still on sale and
I went to the website they're not walk
around
now there was $36 again and now I'm like
no now I regret it this is the life of a
makeup lover okay this is true life
right here I didn't buy them I just
thought they were too expensive for the
six shades and how I'm kind of bummed at
myself because if I had a hard time
spending $27 obviously I'm gonna have a
hard time spending $36 so I think we're
just not meant to be and I talked about
him in the 8th brand's video too and I
said you guys think I should buy the
minis or do you think I should just wait
for the Queen of Hearts to come back
because Queen of Hearts is kind of like
the most like well known color green
eyeshadow palette and a lot of you guys
said to wait for the Queen of Hearts so
I guess I'll just do that but I thought
it was kind of a funny story and you
know kind of one of the reasons why I
start the will i buy it series 2 is just
to get like an insight of what goes on
for when a regular galas behind makeup
and the thought process that we'd go
through and you can kind of see like yes
it's in my card no it's not yes I'm
gonna purchase it no I'm not like I just
think that's kind of like funny and
interesting that's what happened of with
the color green mini palette I talked to
myself and I talked himself out I talk
to myself in I talk to myself out and
now it's too late now they've gone back
up to regular price so I'm like shucks
but I think I'll continue to hold strong
especially now since they're at the
regular price I'll hold strong I'll keep
watching for that Queen of Hearts
palette to come back I I saw it come
back around the Black Friday they were
doing like a really good discount on it
and I was gonna get it then and I was
too late I think I think it sold out
within like minutes of it going on sale
for their Black Friday sale which was a
huge bummer I know a lot of you guys
said you missed out on it too I will
continue to just love on these mini
pellets from afar I guess oh it's gonna
be everything for today so will I buy a
video I really hope that you guys
