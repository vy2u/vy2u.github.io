today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will I buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
over some new makeup releases and then
chatting about if I'm planning to pick
them up or pass over them and as always
I've watched shows about this week so
let me go ahead and get started alright
I don't think this week is gonna be as
long as last week but what's crazy to me
is last week there was so much to talk
about I think it was like a 27 minute
video and I skipped a whole roll of
photos on my phone when I get tagged on
like Instagram I just screenshot it and
I have a special folder on my phone I
skipped an entire row while filming last
week's will about video so I'm gonna
start with those but can you imagine I
still had four other releases to talk
about in that video that would've been
so freaking long but I did get a lot of
text on this one here from colour-pop
they came out with a new new cool toned
essentials palette so said it was
available May 10th on their website and
it was in celebration of their birthday
month ok honestly I'll just kind of
briefly touch on it since it already did
come out it's called Fame I believe to
me it just was way too basic basically I
think when I saw it I feel like my eye
is just kind of like glazed over it and
I am a neutral silver I am a pretty
basic gal when it comes to my eye makeup
and I like having those kind of palettes
because I reach for them a lot but this
one it was just too vanilla for me if
you know what I'm saying so that one did
not did not get me excited at all
another palette that came out this is
like the complete opposite of it this is
from Maybelline so they're coming out
with a new eyeshadow palette called soda
pop so there's blue and purple and
orange and berry shades and they're all
like they're named like soda fizz tonic
ginger ale cherry cola that's kind of
fun root beer so that's pretty fun it
says it's not gonna be available though
until August which is kind of crazy so
that's a pretty I mean we're finding out
pretty far in advance about this palette
it definitely does look interesting
Maybelline's been releasing some of
these newer palettes they had was at the
lemonade craze palette things like that
I really didn't hear a lot of people
talking about that
so I don't really know what the formula
was like I think maybe I saw like one or
two videos on it so I don't know if that
means it wasn't a great palette not sure
what was going to have you guys tried it
let us know if you have in the comments
so I know but I'm assuming you know
maybe the formulas would be somewhat
similar that packaging is similar and
all that but Maybelline eyeshadows don't
usually get my juices flowing as I like
to say I I don't know I've tried a bunch
of them in the past and I think they're
okay but jokes where prices are like
creeping up there I don't know what for
sure what this one cost but definitely
like the prices are creeping up and I
don't always think the quality is
creeping up along with them the colors
in here are definitely a lot of fun I
wish it was releasing sooner than August
though because I feel like I don't know
I feel like these colorful looks at like
we want them right now but especially
for a summer like I love doing more you
know pops of color and stuff for
summertime makeup so I'm like why are
you coming out at the end of it cuz by
at the time of August rolls around we're
thinking about fall you know what I mean
so like hmm that's kind of interesting
but I'm curious about that palette okay
my eye on it okay another new release
this one has me interested this is from
BH Cosmetics so they came out with a new
brush set this is their marble luxe
brush set and includes ten brushes for
the face and eyes and they all have like
the marble handles so ten brushes
they're gonna be $38 and it says they'll
be available may 18th on their website
so I will have it linked down below I'm
not sure if these would be available at
Ulta but I'm actually pretty interested
in these and I kind of really want them
I love the look of the Marvel but I love
they've like those big fat based brushes
in there like I just love them so much
um but I like that they have the eye
brushes in there as well they look
really nice at least in the photos I'm
looking at like they look kind of Alyss
a little bit more luxurious but I
actually like BH brushes I that's how I
started buying and like building up my
brush collection was BH Cosmetics and
their brushes and I bought their big old
brush kits and all of that
I recommend their brushes quite
frequently and I'm pretty interested in
this one but I need to do a brush
declutter it's ridiculous I'm looking at
Rush's I'm once again out of room I have
I have like a bookshelf
I have little brush holders throughout
and everything is so full I now have
brushes just laying on that shelf so I
need to do a brush declutter before I
let myself buy new brushes but I really
want to get that going soon because I'm
actually really quite interested in
these I kinda want them okay was that no
one more that I forgot from last week so
a Lamar cosmetics I got a lot of tanks
on this one and this was the one when I
was watching back like editing my video
I was like I feel like I missed a big
like a big announcement or something and
does the Alomar cosmetics I hope that
I'm saying that right I feel like that's
how I've seen other people pronouncing
it so that's what I'm gonna go with but
this is by Gabi T mu way
Gabi T mu way that's her Instagram
handle she is one of kathleenlights
friends I think she does like her make
it for her on with the kale polish
shoots and things like that so it's
super exciting so she's coming out with
her first product which is an eyeshadow
palette eyeshadow palette is available
now she also has a brush trail that's
out so I'll have the website link down
below the eyeshadow palette is going to
be $28 and there's eight different
shades in there the shades look really
pretty there's definitely some very like
vibrant colors in there don't feel like
$28 is a bad price sometimes when you
see the indie brands pop up they kind of
have to have a higher price tag so I
don't I mean it is only eight shades but
when I saw $28 I was like oh I guess I
like I'm just I feel like I'm getting
accustomed to brands pricing things
higher like I feel like I'm just getting
used to that so $28 isn't bad it's it's
kind of one of those things like do I
need this palette probably not but it
looks really pretty let us know since it
is already available I don't know if any
of you guys ordered it if you do have it
already and what you think about it of
course when you're ordering from a new
brand it can be kind of be like you
don't really know what to expect on a
whole different facet of things so I
would love to know anyone's feedback
that you have this this one has my it
definitely has my attention I think
that's very cool it's always exciting to
see new brands popping up I think that's
pretty awesome
so I can't
for sure that I'm gonna purchase it but
maybe if I hear like some really awesome
things about the pallet I would but I
think it's pretty exciting so a big
congratulations to Yahweh that's a
pretty darn huge thing so very cool I
will have it linked down below be sure
to let us know your thoughts so I think
that was everything that I didn't
mention last week so then moving on to
some newer tags that I was getting so I
just saw this one today
Beautyblender has a new cleanser it's
called the insta clean and it says it's
like a dry shampoo for your Beauty
Blender and brushes and it's gonna be
sixteen dollars I okay so it says you
can clean your tools without water no
matter where you are where you're going
it's alcohol-free there's a quick drying
spray I'm curious about this I'm very
curious about it it sounds like to me it
sounds similar to like the cinema
secrets cleanser and cut because that's
a you know no rinse you don't know wait
time kind of thing to just clean it like
spot clean your brushes so that's pretty
cool sixteen dollars that doesn't seem
like a bad price I actually do like
Beauty blenders like their cleansers
that they have I actually buy I have one
right here actually do get these solids
and I really like to clean my Beauty
blenders with them and this is just
called the blender cleanser solid this
one is in chill swirl I just used up
like one of the regular ones so I've
actually got my curious about this
someone I kind of want to give it a shot
I just think obviously you need to deep
clean your brushes like I try to deep
clean my brushes I really like two weeks
or so but having to like spot clean them
even though I have a larger brush
collection I still find myself having to
do that so I don't know that could be
pretty cool I'm interested in sixteen
dollars too I mean that doesn't sound
terrible I don't think so of course I
got a whole lot of tags on the new glow
kit that I'm Stasi is coming out with so
we saw kind of like the outer packaging
first and I don't know yeah I was so a
glow kid I I couldn't quite get super
excited over a glow kit because I
haven't had the best experience but my
glow kits in the past almost all of my
glow kids have come to me shattered
they're just I don't know they just must
break very easily and transit or things
like that and I've ended
decluttering have I too cluttered all of
my cloak heads I might have had too
cluttered all of my Glo kits so that's
kind of a bummer sigh I can't say I was
like super hyped when I saw a new cloak
it was coming out but you know I still
wanted to see the inside so this is the
iridescent glow dream glow kit it has
six different shades inside it's gonna
be available May 22nd I can't say I'm
excited about that at all on iridescent
highlighters just better just not my
favorite I just don't really reach for
them a lot and I have a whole palette
from Sigma where like if I'm in the mood
for a iridescent highlight which
sometimes I can be I can be sometimes
but if I'm in the mood for that I will
reach for I think it's called like the
chroma glow palette I quite like that
one and I feel like I maybe have a few
more like scattered here and there
throughout my collection but it's just
not what I gravitate towards it's not
something that I would get a lot of use
out of so I didn't see a price on this
post and trend mood but most of the
globe kits are around the $40 price
range so probably it's gonna be that but
I can't say I got super hyped when I saw
that which I mean it isn't always a bad
thing last week there was a lot of
things that caught my attention my Ulta
Sephora and beauty lush bags are all
pretty darn full at the moment I'm
trying to decide like should I place an
order at one of these sites what should
I do
so it's it I don't know I don't get to
like butthurt when brands come out with
things that don't super excite me
because I'm find enough makeup as it is
like it's cool if I can skip over
release but yeah I can't say like luck
it really did anything for me personally
of course it looks like Physicians
Formula is coming out with another new
product they're kind of coming out with
a lot here lately okay so they are
coming out with the new body butter it's
gonna be a part of their new butter
collection so they have those pallets
that came out fairly recently so now
they have a body butter so I guess it's
supposed is it I mean assuming it's
gonna be for your whole body I don't see
too much else besides just saying that
it's gonna be coming to see on so that's
pretty interesting I wonder if it will
have that same scent that we're kind of
known that week and I know Physicians
Formula for I'm curious about this I
think it's an interesting release just
like their with their pallets they
have the fragrance release I thought
that was pretty intriguing so now I
think the body butter is pretty
intriguing honestly I've been using the
soap and glory righteous body butter for
like the past month now and I'm freakin
like obsessed with it it smells so good
I love how thick it is I feel like it
makes my skin look really nice so I
don't I don't know if I would want to
step away from that because I feel like
we're getting along really well so I
don't know what do you guys think I got
so many tags on that one so I feel like
a lot of people have to be pretty darn
excited about it it's not something that
maybe gets me like as amped up as other
things too but I don't know still pretty
interesting okay what else do we got
NARS orgasm okay
NARS is coming out with a new collection
a new orbit azzam collection for your
face and lips because why not of course
they are it's part of their summer 20:18
collection it includes the afterglow lip
balm for $28 a full vinyl lip lacquer
for $26 a special edition orgasm blush
for $39 and the illuminating loose
powder for $28 it's all going to be
available on May 20th
so not I mean I can remember NARS orgasm
from like way back in the day like some
of the first times I can ever remember
walking into Sephora and not wanting to
ask like just feeling really but I was
like everybody has that blush like I
want that blush I ended up never getting
the blush I've never tried swatched it
in Sephora but I thought it wasn't a
blush for me so I've never actually
tried the NARS orgasm
blush so this new collection that
they're coming out with the illuminating
loose powder for $20 I wouldn't be
interested in that I'm not super
interested in anything like loose
powders or whatnot and it's illuminating
some assuming it's a highlight powder
that's just not my favorite way to put
highlight on so they're lip balm is $28
that's gonna be too expensive for me for
a lip balm I don't wear a lot of lip
balms
I don't gravitate towards them a lot so
to pay almost $30 for one that's not
gonna happen the full vinyl lip lacquer
for $26 that one's I don't I'm kind of
about that one but still probably that
enough to get it but the special edition
orgasm blush for $39 I guess I don't
know for sure why it's special edition I
think it looks like it has maybe like
different packaging and whatnot but from
what I remember when I went in and
watched the blush which I mean I've done
this like multiple times so it's years
because I still always hear people talk
about it it's got a lot of glitter right
or it's like super shimmery am I
thinking of the right one you can tell
me I'm not but I felt like it was just a
blush that I wouldn't gravitate towards
to a lot so I never ended up buying it
so when I see a special edition one
still doesn't get me excited because I
just don't think it's gonna be a blush
that I would love so I don't know are
you guys interested in this new orgasm
collection from NARS let us know so glam
glow is coming out with a new mask this
is the instant mud 62nd pore refining
treatment
it's a foaming treatment mask to
instantly refine pores and even skin
tones leaving skin smooth and soft in
only 60 seconds that's gonna be
available for $42 and available May 22nd
at Sephora I think it's available now on
the glam globe website so it looks kind
of like a hot purple mask I honestly I'm
not super into glam glow I've tried
their mess before and well I think some
of them are okay some of them were
absolutely duds for me and they're very
very pricey I talked about last week
that Lula Hendrickson is coming out with
a new mask it's the cold pour plunge
called plunge pour mask or something
like that and that's currently in my car
at Sephora because I really do want that
so I would prefer that over the glam
glow and like I love Lula Hendrix in
there one of my favorite skincare brands
I buy a ton from them so I would rather
get that and I think that one's only
thirty six dollars compared to the forty
two so it sounds like like maybe they're
gonna be doing somewhat similar things
and I would just rather go with it
little Hendrickson to be honest I love
all the tags that came in on this next
one I remember opening my Instagram
yesterday and just seeing a whole row of
tags and I was like whoo what is it what
is it it is from lawless beauty they are
coming out with a foundation I'm so
for excited about this and I love that
so many of you guys knew I was gonna be
excited about this so lawless beauty it
has quickly become a pretty like
standout brand to me if you guys aren't
familiar with all this beauty definitely
check them out check out
Annie lawless she is like I remember
first hearing about lawless beauty and
just getting lost in all of the
different articles and interviews about
Annie lawless she's someone who like I
just love girl bosses female
entrepreneurs just like women who go out
there and like get it done and Annie
lawless is that to me so much so she
obviously found it lawless beauty and
their first product was liquid lipsticks
I love their liquid lipsticks I highly
recommend them I have four shades I
purchased one lately in the VIP sale
they're expensive but I do think that
they're worth it so this is gonna be
their next product and I'm so excited to
see a foundation come on now foundation
and liquid lipstick it's like two of my
favorite makeup products I was like yes
so this is called the woke up like this
flawless a finish foundation so it is
supposed to be let's let's just read
about it here lightweight antioxidant
rich skin balancing oils it does say
that it will help promote collagen
perfect for me it's medium to full
buildable coverage and a fresh radiant
satin finish for $46 all this beauty
recently came into Sephora which is
super super exciting so once it comes in
to Sephora it says it'll be available
june 1st on their website june 5th at
sephora you girls gonna pick this up $46
don't feel like it's a terrible price
medium to full coverage wonderful sweet
spot fresh radiant satin finish yes

is natural AF they just use a lot of
natural good for you ingredients are
also cruelty free so that is a good
thing but I'm pretty excited about this

film I will I buy but let me just check

real quick
Charlotte Tilbury is supposed to be
coming into Sephora I think they're
saying it's just a rumor right now it
says there's a rumor another brain is
coming in to Sephora Charlotte Tilbury
make up if that's true I'm gonna be
pretty excited but honestly Beauty lish
I should have a haul video up from last
weekend Beauty lish impressed me so much
made my first order with them loved how
everything came wrapped in packaged
super super quick they have that payment
plan that I think it's a wonderful
addition to have so I purchased a couple
items from Charlotte Tilbury in that
beauty list order but very cool that
they're coming into Sephora I do like
Sephora warts and all of that as well so
I think that's pretty awesome but after
