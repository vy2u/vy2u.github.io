today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them as always I have a lot to talk
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started so a first up I got a
lot of tags on this new release from Wet
n Wild they are coming out with a
highlighter palette it's the mega glow
highlighting palette which includes the
mythical highlighters in there they have
four limited edition shades in here
sweet puny wild Cosmo diamond lily and
blushing Elia I'm reading from the trend
would want instagrams so her page will
be linked down below it's going to be a
$14.99 it looks like it will be
available at Ulta beauty online a wet
and wild and then also at Walmart all
right getting lots of questions on these
and I feel like a lot of people are
really excited over this the first
thought was like oh my gosh that's super
cute it kind of reminded me of like the
Anasazi of glow kids type of packaging
when you first look at it and when you
open it up the highlighters in there are
very very large so one thing that kind
of caught my attention right away is
that all the four shades inside will be
limited edition I think I would have
been more excited for this one if it was
some of their regular shades because
I've only purchased one of the Wet n
Wild mega glow highlighters and I can't
think of which shade it was enough I can
remember I will put it here on the
screen it's already been a long day it's
only 2:30 so that's where I'm at right
now but I have one and there's other
ones that I want to try and I feel like
if maybe there was some in this palette
I would be like yes I should get this
palette because then I could have them
all in one but they're all limited
edition and I'm that person who doesn't
get really drawn to limited edition I
know a lot of people feel with limited
edition they have to go out and buy it
right away and I'm just like the total
opposite Limited Edition doesn't really
do anything for me so when I saw all the
shades in there were a limited edition I
was kind of like oh I don't know that
doesn't really impress me too much say
that I appreciate that the shades are
pretty different
sometimes with like highlighter palettes
or blush peláez when you're getting all
of the same product sometimes things can
look a little bit too similar
and I don't like that cuz I don't want
to buy a kit that has different shades
but they all look like they're just a
slight variation of the other there's
not really like oh these are kind of
similar to one another like know that I
feel like they are all very distinct so
I do appreciate that for sure and that
the pant sizes are huge like I said
14.99 I don't I guess that's not like a
terrible price for for highlighters
especially when they are so big I know
when some of you were tagging me or
sending it to my jerk messages on
instagramming or saying that you thought
the price was too high and I can totally
see that I mean drugstore is definitely
creeping up there with basically
everything lately so but I guess and in
my opinion I don't know I $15 it doesn't
seem terrible to me for these four big
highlighters but I do have to say that
for me I am gonna pass over this one I
don't feel like I need another
highlighting palette right now it did
just buy the Beca face appellant the one
that came out for holiday I have opal on
my cheeks right now from that palette I
did a highlight declutter and I'm pretty
happy with all the highlights I have in
my collection I felt like I was kind of
getting really cluttered there for a
while and then like I said I do have the
one wet wild highlighter and I like it
but I don't feel like I'm super in love
with it like I like it I didn't return
it you know I didn't declutter it when I
did my highlight declutter but I'm not
like super super in love with them yet
which I know a lot of people are so I'm
like waiting for myself to fall in love
finally but it hasn't happened yet so I
don't think I would need a highlight
palette with four of these shades again
with all of them being a limited edition
I would rather just purchase some of the
regular highlights that's how I feel
about limited edition I would just
rather purchase the the regular items
that are out but definitely caught my
attention I know a lot of you seem very
excited about it so I would love to know
if you're planning on getting it do you
like the highlight shades if they chose
in there do you think the price is too
high do you think it's just right let us
know your feedback down below but I'm
gonna go ahead and skip on be
wet-and-wild highlight palette so the
next item I was getting quite a few tags
on is from violet Voss they're coming
out with a new eyeshadow palette this is
called taupe knotch plan words they're
taupe instead of top notch and it is
going to be releasing October 24th on
their website and then it will
be in support of violet bosses coming to
Sephora well I am quite excited about I
do own a violent boss a shadow palette
the Holy Grail and I really enjoy it and
I have wanted to try more of their
products and I think once they come into
Sephora I'll kind of be more apt to do
that you know things for me like better
shipping faster shipping rewards points
you know all of that good stuff so I'm
very very excited let me know if you're
excited that violet boss is coming into
Sephora
because I sure AM so this eyeshadow
palette will be available on both the
abelev us website and also on Sephora I
believe it will be $45 I didn't see the
price on their Instagram but there are
other accidental pellets that have the
same amount of shades they are $45 so
that is what I am assuming that this one
will be I this one I did the double take
because like I said I've been wanting to
try more for the boss i shadow pellets
knowing that it was going into Sephora I
did the double take and I kind of had to
look at it and stare at it for a while I
mean it's a very monochromatic palette
for sure it's it's full of Browns and
topes obviously as the name would
suggest but to me I feel like it's just
too similar sometimes I can struggle
because especially with like the warm
tone palettes and like I feel like
there's so many similar shades in here
but they are different like they're
different enough that I can go ahead and
you know this will be worth it for me
but looking at this one I'm like I just
don't know they just it just looks like
I could create two looks with this I
don't you know I don't know what I can
do here
and I was watching a Babs Beauty
snapchat the night before I'm filming
this actually and she was watching it
and she even said that there was three
shades I think it was in the second row
it was like three Matt Browns she was
like I don't really see a difference in
these these all look to be the same to
me and I'm like see that was my that was
my concern with this palette I think
it's almost just too monochromatic and
my Holy Grail palette that I have it has
a ton of matte brows in there I love
doing a matte brown smokey eye it's one
of my favorite looks and I constantly
reach for my boss Holy Grail for that
look it's my favorite palette to do
matte brown smokey eye so I'm like what
I need a full palette of all of those
kind of tones when I know I love my
whole
girl for that it just didn't really seem
worth it to me so I talked to myself on
buying it I was like no I think it's too
monochromatic for me I feel like I have
similar shades in the Holy Grail that I
enjoy very much so I'm gonna pass over
that line then but I will continue to be
watching I'm excited to see what all
inventory goes on the sephora website
i'm not sure if everything will go on
sephora i'm not sure if they'll only
have a few select items to start off
with I'm not really sure but I'll be
curious I'll definitely be checking out
by Lovaas on Sephora as well but of
course I'd love to know it did the tope
nacho eyeshadow palette call to you do
you feel drawn to it or is this just not
your cup of tea like it's not mine
let us know so next one is some new
releases from a huda beauty she is
putting out a lot lately but she is
releasing four new mini eyeshadows so
there's going to be a smokey obsession
electric obsession warm Brown obsession
and mob obsession each one includes nine
shades it's going to be 27 dollars will
be available November 1st at cult beauty
November 2nd at Sephora so obviously
each of the palettes has its own you
know theme to it $27 for 9 shades I
don't think that's a bad price I haven't
tried any of the Hoodoo eyeshadow
palettes her bigger pellets are $65 I
believe the first one the rose gold eye
I didn't hear many great reviews on it
so I passed over that one and it was
kind of a big reason why I passed over
the second one that just released pretty
recently the desert dusk 1 I think
that's what it was called but I have
been hearing better reviews on that one
so sometimes I'm kind of more attracted
to these mini palettes like I talked
about the Natasha Danone a holiday
eyeshadow palettes in my last holiday
video because her you know bigger
pallets are so expensive I was like
maybe I should try some of these smaller
palettes so with this one I mean I feel
like definitely the ones that I'm more
attracted to our warm Brown obsession of
course and then also be a mauve one but
I don't I don't know to be honest to be
to be really honest and I don't know if
I'm going to be not super popular here
when I say this but these didn't cause
me to do a dump take like I saw it I saw
a tag came in on Instagram so I
I pulled up the photo and I was like huh
meaning I show pellets wonder what a
shape for lunch like I didn't have a
strong reaction to it
for whatever reason sometimes I have
strong reactions to items like I do a
double-take on an item that I'm like why
would you why did that catch your
attention of all things and then there's
other items like this hooter one that
I'm like I think I'm supposed to be
excited about this one and like really
pumped for it but for some reason it
didn't cause me to have that reaction
and a lot of times what I say in the
will I've added videos is that if you
don't immediately do a double-take or
have some sort of reaction to a product
just move on just move on to the next
one because there's going to be a new
release every single day so I try really
hard not to not to just get sucked into
the hype because I feel like these
pallets are probably gonna be pretty
hyped up I try not to get sucked into
the hype or to talk myself into makeup
because there's so many other makeup
products that I want to buy and that I
am buying and yeah that's kind of what I
feel about the Hoodoo ones I don't know
why I don't know what it is I feel like
I'm supposed to be attracted to these
but you know I picked out the two that I
thought maybe would interest me the most
but really even looking out the shades
I'm like I know I own those in different
palettes I just I'm not sure that I need
it and I like how to beauty as a brand I
like her eyelashes love the liquid
lipsticks I do want to try out the
foundation I have it on my loves list at
Sephora right now I do want to try out
the foundation I'm curious about that
one but for some reason these pallets I
just I don't know what it is with her
eyeshadow polyps you know maybe because
of the reviews that came in on the first
one that I'm still leery I don't know
cuz like I said I'm hearing good things
about the second palette but again the
biggest thing that comes down to for me
is that I didn't do a double-take so I
don't need to talk myself into it so
we're just gonna pass over them so I'd
love to know if you are curious about
these have you tried the who two
eyeshadows are these gonna be your first
purchase you like having the mini
palettes
I don't know I would love to hear your
thoughts so let me know down below and
the last item that I'm going to talk
about is of course the most requested
which is of course the color pop
eyeshadow palette that's going to be
released at Sephora is
buddy else's mind still blown how
colour-pop is coming into Sephora
because I'm confused like violet boss I
can understand violet boss has a higher
price point the color pop has always
been one to be more affordable brands
out there that I'm just shocked that
they're not in Ulta and that they're
coming to Sephora still totally confused
on this but a lot of people have been
very hyped we knew that color pop was
coming into Sephora so the eyeshadow
palette that is coming is called the
Golden State of Mind it's an all shimmer
palette it's going to be $26 it'll be
available October 31st online and in
select stores at us and then online at
Canada so we're getting 15 shades for
$26 not terrible I guess but for me my
problem is that this is an all shimmer
palette if you've seen me talking about
some of the pellets in the past the
Urban Decay heavy metal shimmer palette
I said I was going to pass over it
because it's all shimmers the scent
Abuna holiday palette the galaxy one I
said is gonna pass over it because it is
all shimmers I actually did get the
Urban Decay collection sent to me which
was so shocking I nearly fell over my
husband was like is this good or is this
bad what happened I was having such a
strong reaction to opening it I was like
no I'm just shocked I do have it on my
eyes today along with a heavy metal
glitter liner that came in that
collection - but whoo that was crazy but
it's something that I went purchase on
my own because I don't I don't tend to
prefer these all shimmer palettes
because I just don't feel like I reach
for them enough I do a lot of matte
looks and all matte looks you know I
have my my comfort zone that I do with
makeup and to me I want to purchase
something more practical because a lot
of times with these all shimmer palettes
I'm creating an eye look and then
reaching for that palette for just like
one shade you know a lid topper you know
maybe two shades things like that but I
just don't feel like they're super
practical purchases so that's why I tend
to skip over a lot of these all shimmer
palettes and it kind of seems like
that's what it's the trend right now it
is these all shimmer pellets the
metallic palettes and to me I'm not mad
about it because I know a lot of people
get mad with certain trends if they
aren't your trend people are like this
trend needs to be over and for me I'm
like this trend can stick around you're
saving me
money it's fine because maybe the next
trend I'm just gonna be like shelling
out all my money because I'm like I
can't help but this trend is just my
thing so the eyeshadow pellets I seem to
keep skipping over but I would skip over
this one from colour-pop too because I
just don't think it would be a practical
purchase for me and honestly I didn't do
a double take out this one either it was
kind of I don't know to me it was kind
of bland to me when I was seeing the
swatches of it I was just kind of like
hmm it just didn't do much it didn't
excite me $26 for the 15 shades I don't
think that's a bad price and if I were
to be interested in it I feel like I
could talk myself into buying something
that's maybe a little bit more
affordable to as my non practical
purchase and that's when you know maybe
I would like to buy something on sale
with a discount code or something for a
more affordable brand that's outside my
comfort zone it's like well at least I'm
not spending a ton of money on it and
then not reaching for it too much so if
the colour-pop palette caught my
attention I would be more inclined to
buy that versus like the urban decay and
the fancy Beauty because those are both
and like the $50 range I believe but the
palette didn't speak to me I still
wouldn't want to spend the $26 on it I
don't feel like I would reach for it a
ton I don't think I would get enough use
out of it and again the biggest thing is
I didn't have that strong reaction to it
it didn't make me do a double-take I'm
curious to see what else
colour-pop is going to be bringing in to
Sephora I'm definitely curious about it
I'm open to it I like color pop as a
brand I have a lot from them I'd love to
know are you so hyped for this palette
these shimmer pellets are your thing I
know I've been talking to some of you
guys in the comments someone left an
interesting comment the other day and it
said I tend to buy these more shimmer
palettes because I do the exact same I
look with mats every day and then I
always reach for a different shimmer as
a top her so she likes to have all these
different shimmers so she can you know
pick a new lid topper basically every
single day and I was like well that's
frickin sweet like I would totally
understand why you would want you know
have these shimmer pellets and all these
different options that's something you
do I thought that was really cool , you
know that's not my personal how I do my
makeup but I think it's interesting to
see you know how we're all different and
how you know we all have these different
makeup vibes I thought that was pretty
cool so you know in my real Evette
videos I'm
I'm never trying to encourage people not
to buy or to buy I tried really hard not
to do that because we're all so
different and we all have so many
different makeup vibes and what we
prefer to spend our money on and you
know what's practical to me is probably
not practical to you might not be
practical to the next person but we all
have like these differences and I think
it's cool and that's why I like to read
the comments especially on the wheel at
both videos because it's fun to see how
we are all different so I'm sure there's
gonna be a ton of you that are super
excited about this color palette I'll
let us know what you think about the
palette what do you think about color
pop coming in to Sephora what do you
want to speak coming in to Sephora next
