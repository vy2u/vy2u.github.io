today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my blind buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about some new makeup releases
and lunches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then also letting you know called
planning to pick them up or pass over
them and as always I have a lot to chat
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started so first of I did get a
ton of tags win at kathleenlights
launches this new a collection with her
nail polish brand which is called KL
polish we just launched a collection
called lips and tips and I was very
interested when I saw this if you guys
don't know I'm a huge nail polish fan I
own a ton of different nail polishes I
actually get acrylics put on at the nail
salon but I say don't paint my nails I
will paint them at home they think I'm
crazy but I've been going through long
enough that were okay with it now
because I just enjoy painting my nails I
like painting my nails
you know like once a week typically I
change up the color so it's so hard to
get off nail polish from the salon so I
say no I'll just do it I have a huge
collection of nail polishes and I love
them
I was really excited to see Captain my
launch KL polish I think it's really
cool to see youtubers doing more
entrepreneurial type of things I just
think that's really neat I do own one KL
polish so far snickerdoodle which is a
nude and I absolutely love it so when I
saw that Phillips and tips was coming
out I was especially curious about this
one because it's sort of a collaboration
with colour-pop not like a full-on
collab but it's like Kathleen has this
new set out and has six nail polishes
inside and each color is based on one of
her collaborations and that she did with
color pop so they are supposed to be you
know similar in color to that lipstick
color and then if you do buy the set
which comes in a nice box you will also
get a one of her color pop collaboration
that lipsticks would be in there which i
think is pretty cool I believe it's an
ultra satin lip that comes with the set
and you would get the six nail polishes
and the one colourpop lip for $45 that
box is limited edition otherwise you can
buy the nail polishes as separately for
850 each so I was excited when I saw
this I've purchased a lot of Kathleen's
collaborations with color pop especially
for lipsticks I really really enjoy them
so when I saw this I was immediately
interested and I did the same thing that
I did with her fall collection where I
first was like
I'm just gonna buy the whole collection
I actually touched on this in a will I
buy it you know last month or whatever
it was when she launched the Fall
collection I was like my first thought
was I'm gonna buy the whole collection
and then when I actually thought about
it
there was colors that I've already had
in their color so I wouldn't really use
and I ended up saying I first sure
wanted to purchase I believe it was two
of them one was that olive green and
there was a day where kale polish was
having a sale on the nail polishes and I
went to purchase that olive green and it
was sold out and I was very upset on my
snapchat so that was a bummer so I
didn't get that one but now she has
these new colors out and I once again
I'm like I really want these a lot of
them are kind of like nude or pink base
which is like my favorite nail color to
wear I have a nude on right now so I
watched Kathleen's video where she was
you know swatching all of the nail
polishes and showing them how they
actually look on the fingernails my two
favorites from the set that I really
wanted by and made notes of them are
Aquarius and Lumiere and then if I had
to pick a third I would go with point
zero that's kind of like the top three
that I picked out but I really really
really want Aquarius but I am holding
off I'm waiting until Black Friday and
Cyber Monday before I make any purchases
I will not let myself make a purchase
until those days because I were to see I
have a feeling Kayla polish will
probably do something for Black Friday
or Cyber Monday
and if Kathleen does I'm going to be
there because I really do want some more
nail polishes I would love to be able to
support but also I just really enjoy
nail polish and I really like the colors
that she came out with I wouldn't really
need to purchase the set you know I have
a couple shades in there that I probably
already have or there was some of the
Pink's that were a little bit like too
pink for me that didn't really interest
me a ton and also I would not need the
lipstick because like I said I think I
have almost every single lipstick Club
that she did with color pop so I
wouldn't need that kind of like bonus
lippy in there these could be really
good for stocking stuffers to give to
friends and things like that you know
maybe you keep two nail polishes and
then you can gift the other four out
things like that it would be a pretty
good value at the $45 but I have the two
in mind that I want to try to get
Aquarius and Lumiere but I'd love to
know if you guys are planning on picking
anything up from the new kale polish
line I feel like we were just talking
about dose of colors and not
no they released new lipstick sets for
the holidays but once again they just
announced some new release news and I
got tagged so much on that one I think
it's because you guys know how much I
love dose of colors they were a brand
that I tried out this year once they
came in to Ulta and I have been
impressed with everything that I've been
trying out from that brand and I just
think they're pretty fantastic so I did
want to go ahead and include these as
well since I was getting a lot of tags
even though I know we were going to talk
about those the colors but they are
releasing new eyeshadow palettes these
are called sassy Siena's and blushing
berries all I have right now is that
they will be available in December I
don't have the exact release date
I am pre filming a bit because we're
gonna be traveling for the holidays so
if I do have the pricing by the time the
video goes up it will be in the
description box down below where
everything else is listed out there and
also linked I'm going to assume that
they are $32 because that is what the
like the marvelous moth our shadow
palette has that I have and also the
baked brown where you know the packaging
is super similar the same amount of
shades and all of that so I'm assuming
these are going to be 32 dollars and I'm
like dose of colors what are you doing
to me right now because I want
everything I have the noodle upset in my
cart which I talked about in the past
will i buy it video it's in my cart I
once again I'm waiting waiting for those
Black Friday deals to come I'm waiting
patiently because I really want that
nude set I'm so scared it's gonna sell
out I have that in my cart they also
released a red one they released a
regular lipstick set with four lipsticks
then I saw they released a three piece
set on Alta I'm like oh my gosh and now
they're coming out with these new
eyeshadow palettes I did purchase
marvelous mobs earlier this year it was
my first purchase from dose of colors
along with their liquid lipstick and
stone I absolutely love them would
highly recommend the eyeshadow palettes
I loved the formula I thought they
performed so well and now when I see
these ones are out I'm like why because
I want both of them and I still want
baked Browns like I am still I'm that
baked brown eyeshadow palette so hard I
love my Browns I'm very colorful today
but I love my Browns and when I looked
at these two I was like okay just pick
one just pick one and it'll be okay and
looking at them looking at the swatches
I'm like I don't know how to pick one
because I want them both are you guys
interested in the
which one are you gravitating toward
just so torn between these I think they
are both beautiful I know I love these
eyeshadow palettes they're so sleek and
compact too they're so easy to travel
with but I love the shades they are
super blendable super pigmented and I
just really want them both I know I know
that I just need to pick one but I can't
decide I'm gonna need some help what do
you guys think which one do you think I
should go with do you think I should
give both I mean if the Black Friday
sales are just popping maybe I will get
both I'll be checking also also be
checking the dose of colors website you
know maybe they'll have something even
better for Black Friday
I'm usually someone who gravitates
towards Auckland Sephora for like points
Ebates
you know the reward system and all of
that but if dose of colors is gonna have
a bangin Black Friday sale then I would
most definitely purchase from the site
because I'm so super interested in these
but I would love to know your thoughts
so what do you think about these new
dose of colors I shadow palettes are you
gonna get them which one would you vote
on for me let me know in the comments
but Wow a dose of colors you are you are
all over the game right now alrighty so
next up we're gonna talk about faced oh
yeah Too Faced if you guys are new to my
channel you might not know that I have
been on a break with Too Faced for about
a year now I think it's been almost a
year since I decided to put my
relationship with Too Faced on hold
gonna kind of upset with their new
releases weren't quite what I had come
to expect from - face to face is one of
like my og brands one of my first
high-end brands that I started
purchasing from and I just was getting
really really disappointed and seeing
what they are coming out with and the
quality of everything it was just a
bummer to me and after I purchased the
white chocolate chip palette and
promptly returned it where I shared a
laugh with the Sephora employee as I've
returned it because even she knew what
was going on I decided I would put them
on pause I'm still using the products
that I that I have from them but I
haven't bought anything from them since
purchasing that white chocolate chip
palette I believe it was the last
December but I like to think that I
believe in second chances I like to
think that I try to keep them open mine
especially when it comes to makeup and
you know I always try to say at the end
of the day it's just makeup I did talk
about their sweet peach or their new
peachy collection that
came out and a past will I buy up video
I almost purchased that eyeshadow
palette but then I watched a bunch of
reviews and I ended up talking myself
out of it because I didn't think I would
need it for my collection you know I
have a pretty big eyeshadow collection
and I didn't feel like it gave me enough
of that double take that pull to justify
getting it because really do I need
another eyeshadow palette no but if
something pulls me enough you know I'll
go ahead and try it but I decided I
didn't pull me enough didn't need it so
now the tanks started coming fast and
furious on this guy and all of my social
media accounts it's funny because it's
usually a makeup product gets a lot of
attention on my Instagram or else on
everybody's sending me tweets of this or
snapchat it's kind of interesting but
this palette I was getting it from all
three outlets like people are just
asking me left and right about this one
so I was like okay let me look at it
I'm let's chat about it so from Too
Faced this is the chocolate gold bar
eyeshadow palette it has a mix of matte
and metallic shades reading from the
trend would one Instagram which will be
linked down below says will be available
for pre-order on December 3rd on my uLTA
Beauty December 11th online and in
stores at Ulta and Sephora ok so we
don't have a price on it that I see here
but again I think the chocolate bar
pellets are around $49 mark so I did
purchased the sweet peach palette which
I absolutely love
I had a lovely subscriber send me the
chocolate bon bons palette which I do
quite enjoy as well and the chocolate
bar palette I feel like are such you
know kind of like cult favorites I
actually mentioned them in my cult
favourite products that I haven't tried
video because everybody always hyped up
these palettes so much and I never tried
them so now we have a new one coming out
and what intrigued me for sure was
seeing swatches of these because the
swatch is like freaking killer and I'm
kind of like hmm interesting has two
faced finally redeemed to themself
I don't know so taking a closer look at
it there's a really cool green in there
there are some goals in there there's
kind of like a funky pop of pink that
I'm like where's that coming from
I don't know I have to say that I'm
curious about it and I honestly think
when I first looked at it I was like
yeah okay that looks pretty cool and
then ice well and then ice
the swatches and I was like those really
came from a two-faced fella are you
serious huh are you this he rias about
that so this one I've been struggling
with because I keep I really want to
like find that product that gets me
excited that gets me pumped that lets me
say to face you can call me again and I
will not let it go to voicemail but I'm
honestly not sure that this one is going
to do it I'm actually going to talk
about an eyeshadow palette NYX that I
feel like could be pretty similar to
this one that I feel like I'm more
interested in and I feel like that's
kind of what's like hanging me up with
this eyeshadow palette I also recently
have gotten quite a few palettes so I'm
trying to pay attention to what I shadow
palettes I'm drawn to especially as we
go into holiday time Black Friday Cyber
Monday time I'm like don't just load up
on eyeshadow palettes just because they
interest you or you know intrigue you
like just trying to watch what you're
spending your money on basically and
type of thing and since I just got so
many different actions of health I'm
like does this one call to me enough
that I can justify it to myself you know
we can all justify our makeup purchases
and really any purchases we can all
justify or we can't justify to each
other and I don't think it's fair to
judge someone on how they justify their
purchases because that's their decision
and that's their money you know
sometimes I'll say things like oh I
don't need an eyeshadow palette and
people jump all over me like no you
don't need anything and I'm like okay
well let's just calm down because it's
just makeup and we shouldn't be so
invested I don't know what other people
choose to spend their money on but back
to my original point is did this turn my
head enough for me to justify spending
what's probably going to be $50 on an
eyeshadow palette and I don't think it's
going to right now like I said I'm going
to talk about another eyeshadow palette
next and I kind of want to see it's
gonna be kind of like the Too Faced the
PG palette for me the sweet maps
whatever the heck that eyeshadow palette
was called I'm gonna watch the reviews
and I'm gonna see what people say I'm
gonna see the I want to see like live
swatches of this thing and I just I just
want to hear other people's thoughts you
know not only am i reviewer but I watch
reviews like crazy
I love reviews they're my favorite thing
to watch on YouTube I'm pretty sure and
I want to see what other people are
saying first maybe they can talk me into
it and I will buy
or maybe they will actually end up
talking me out of it like what happened
with the peach palette so I'm gonna hang
on to my $50 until I decide that I'm
going to let two-faced creep on in on
this you know what I'm saying I'm gonna
wait I'm gonna watch the reviews but I
want to know what you guys think too
because I got so many tags on this one
are you guys excited did you see the
swatches do they excite you like me do
you think two-faced is going to really
redeem some of these kind of like
releases of the past with this chocolate
gold bar palette I mean it got my
attention I will say it got my attention
I did the old double take the little
side I have this palette but I'm gonna
wait and see the reviews I want to see
what other people are saying before I
decide to part ways with my money and
then the other eyeshadow fella that I'm
talking about that has caught my
attention is actually from colour-pop
cosmetics
ah yes color 5 you always find a way to
reel me in you find that way I talk
about color pump a lot as well because
they are always releasing a ton of
different items that is so crazy it is
so hard to keep up with color pop and I
go through this kind of like love-hate
relationship with color pop where I'm
like slow down you're putting too much
out right now it is too overwhelming I'm
not gonna purchase from you no and then
they release something and I'm like
color pop come into my life I just want
to give you a squeeze and that's where
we're at right now with the release of
the all I see is magic eye shadow
palette now I really really enjoyed the
color pop pressed eyeshadows differ from
the super shock shadows that they are so
well known for some of their first
releases but color crop ever released as
a brand they have these press a shadow
palettes now I mentioned them in my gift
guide video I'm so impressed with them I
have three smaller palettes with four
shades my friend Candace sent me the yes
please tell it very impressed with that
palette that's a very hyped up palette
finally got my hands on it thanks to
Candace and I really do enjoy it and
I've wanted to add another one to my
collection but I was kind of like no
nope nope and then all of a sudden I see
the all I see is magic and I'm like you
getting me now this one it's not like an
exact dupe or anything for the two-faced
one I'm not trying to compare it that
way I'm just trying to say not only do I
have the dose of colors eyeshadows that
I'm seriously thinking about getting the
eyeshadow palettes but now I have this
one from colour-pop so it's like do I
really need to add you know five
total pallets to my collection within a
two-week period probably not that's not
what I need
personally myself might be different
from you but this one really caught my
attention and there is that green in
there that I feel like maybe might be
similar to the two-faced one but there's
mattes in here and there shimmers in
here at the shimmers are totally calling
to me the mats are calling to me I know
that I really enjoy the color palette
press eyeshadows and I just think this
palette is so so beautiful I know some
people didn't get it in PR and I haven't
been able to watch all the videos yet
except kind of have a busier weekend but
I want to sit down I want to watch the
videos and see all the swatches and just
make sure but as of right now I'm really
considering getting this one I again I
am waiting for colour-pop to see if they
have some sort of special ordeal that is
coming out I know they've had a couple
specials the last few days but nothing
has applied to this palette and I'm like
I'm just watching and waiting and I see
something on Instagram or snapchat about
a color pop sale I'm like yes yes yes
and then it's like oh not available on
palettes I'm like but it actually is
still available even at the time that
I'm filming it is still available and
it's been released for quite a few days
now so it's not something that like sold
out immediately like the yesplease
palette like sold out within 30 minutes
type thing so I'm really really hoping
that it sticks around and I'm hoping
that I can get it for a discount like I
said I really am trying not to purchase
anything until the Black Friday Cyber
Monday deal start coming out because I
would hate to purchase stuff and then
just a few days later it's like 50% off
you know 20% off free gifts free
shipping and I'm like great I just
bought everything so that was stupid so
I'm gonna try to wait but this palette
really really has caught my attention
and $20.00 is better than the $49 for
the toothpaste one and honestly if I had
to you know pick color pop or two-faced
I am still gonna go with color pop like
yes they can really overwhelm me with
releases sometimes but I also really
enjoyed the quality of their products
and I don't have as many problems with
them as I do with Too Faced so I would
rather choose color pop but I would love
to know what do you guys think about the
all I see is magic palette I got so many
tags on this one and a lot of you guys
seemed really excited has anybody
purchased it yet do you actually have it
in your hands yet what do you think
about it I would love to know but this
one like oh yes this one you got my
color pop okay so that does give me
everything
for this week's of a lie by it I really
hope that you enjoyed this week's video

some way as always I hope that you will
leave me some comments down below what
did you think about all the items that I
