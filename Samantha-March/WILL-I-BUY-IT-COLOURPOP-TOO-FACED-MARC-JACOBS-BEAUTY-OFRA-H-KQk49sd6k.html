today's video is gonna be a new will I
buy it I put some oval I buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about some new makeup releases
and lunches letting you know a little
bit about them and then also talking
over if I'm going to pick them up or
press over them as always I have left to
chat about this week so why don't we go
ahead and get started
alright I want to say I woke up with my
eyes like super super swollen I was
trying out some new products the other
day and I woke up with eyes like super
swollen so I wasn't really able to do
anything with my eye makeup today but I
was like let's just throw in a purple
lip and call it a day so yeah if you
notice that my eyes are looking a little
crazy I think I'm having some sort of
reaction to some makeup I was testing
out which is a bummer but anyways I just
thought I'd throw that out there but the
first item that I want to chat about I
was giving us some tags on a new
collection from Oprah so they have a new
collection of her Valentine's Day I'm
reading off they turn them in one
Instagram a page so I will have her
Instagram linked in my description box
so they have a feeling my self highlight
palette which has Rodeo Drive blissful
and then they also have a new shade
called pillow talk so you get three
different shades in there for $35 you
can also get the pillow talk a single
highlight it says it's a globe topper in
a soft pearl pink decadence for $35 it's
$35 for the single highlight and $35 for
the highlight palette okay alrighty and
then they also have new at liquid
lipstick trio this is called me myself
and I
with Minah unzipped and a new shade in
Santa Ana and that's $50 for the three
lipsticks and then also their peptide
brightening mask of the pink edition it
says it gives the skin the ultimate
Beauty boost relaxation cooling and oil
absorbing and it's $19 says will be
available January 30th at 1 p.m. est on
their website and there also is over
codes I know a lot of people have an
overcoat I myself do not have one but
there are a lot out there if you do
purchase directly from the Ophir website
I didn't see if it will be on auto but
Oprah is also sold on Ulta as well so
any links that I have will will be in
the description box of course
ok so first up the highlight palette
well the highlight palette has rotate
drive and blissful in there and I have
both of those highlights so to buy the
highlight palette for me would it make
sense it's $35 so I would go ahead and
pass over at the palette but then they
also have the new single highlight and
pillow talk which is $35 by itself and
I've been seeing people getting the
collection in PR and doing the swatches
and I'm really feeling on the way that
this highlight looks because it does
have that pink shift to it and I think
it's really pretty and it's kind of what
I've been reaching for lately I have
straight gold on today but I've been
reaching for my pink highlights as of
lately and so when I saw the swatches
coming in a bit I was like mmm
you're pretty $35 is definitely
expensive I think on the Oprah website I
think people have coats for 30% off I
want to say it is and then you know if
you purchase from the alte website I'll
test their 20% coupon at this time and
it does include a perceived brands and
all of that I wish they were just a
little bit cheaper I do have a lot of
Oprah highlights I have blissful I have
Rodeo Drive I'm pretty sure I have
another one I have one from the
nikkietutorials collaboration as well
and they are nice they are blinding like
if you want a subtle highlight I do not
recommend over highlights because they
are very insane very intense highlights
so I am super attracted to the
pillow-talk but especially right right
now with everything that's going on if
you guys missed last week's Villa by a
video I did throw out and there that my
husband actually lost his job two weeks
ago we could go or something like that
and we're still kind of like up in the
air with what we're doing so I can't
really just be like what if I do but
today you know what I'm saying so I'm
having to be a little bit more careful
about my makeup purchases right now and
unless I have like a fantastic deal or a
gift card or something like that I'm
really not going to be making a ton of
makeup purchases right now but if if I
did I think that I would buy pillow talk
because especially as I was seeing
people swatch it on their snapchat and
such I was like that looks like just us
living at the highlight that I want in
my life right now and I know all four
highlights are really good so I wouldn't
do the palate because it wouldn't make
sense for me but if you haven't tried
the old four palette you know I think
the highlights in there just a little
bit smaller and you could try three of
them for the $35 but they have amazing
highlights
and if I could right now I would pie I
would buy the pillowtop I like because
it looks really gorgeous but 35 is gonna
be a little bit out there for me right
now they also have a new at liquid
lipstick trio it's $50 for the three
shades and they look pretty dark this is
a Valentine's Day collection so they
just look to be there's like a red in
there maybe like a deeper pink and then
a more vampy color as well so kind of
like your Valentine's Day colors but not
necessarily my tones as I'm wearing
purple lipstick today but you know
sometimes you have those days or ESS
switch it up a little bit especially
when you can't really do anything with
your eye makeup but they're not
necessarily like super my tones so I
wouldn't necessarily want to buy a trio
of it definitely sometimes it makes
sense for me to buy a set or a
collection but then sometimes it just
makes more sense to just buy the one
shade that I really prefer and there's
not a shade in here that I'm like yes
absolutely super and need that one so
I'm gonna pass over it but I will say
that I love the ofra liquid lipstick
formula I have a lot of them and I
really enjoy them maybe if this was like
a nude set I might be into it a little
bit more but because they're the deeper
darker colors that I don't wear super
often I know especially right now that I
can go ahead and say no to it but I do
really like their liquid lipsticks and
they also have the peptide brightening
mask you know I haven't tried much of
the Oprah skincare I'd love to know if
you guys have I feel like I've been
hearing about it more and more lately
but I've never tried any for myself
except I have tried their coffee scrub
which is more like body care versus like
just skincare face you know what I'm
saying
I have tried that and I I like that one
but other than that I haven't really
tried anything else of the elf or
skincare so I can't really stay on that
one I am going to pass over it for right
now I do have a ton of skincare I've
gotten some pretty cool PR packages as
of lately and skincare is kind of one of
my weaknesses I buy it anyways even if I
have a lot of it um I just really enjoy
skincare but I know that I have quite a
few products that I want to be trying
and reviewing and then I just have like
my staples that I love so much so I
don't necessarily need more skincare in
my life at this moment so I'm gonna pass
over that but if you guys have feedback
on the O for skincare if there's
something that you love and you've tried
a new ad recommend let us know but
definitely out of the over collection
the one that caught my attention the
most was the pillow-talk highlight but
for right now I'm gonna go ahead and
pass over everything but I'd love to
know if you are eyeing anything from
this collection if you're hoping maybe
it'll come to Ulta if you're purchased
it off of our website
I would love to know market Jacobs
Beauty or Mark beauty is coming out with
a new foundation I was getting a lot of
types on this one and I was thinking
maybe it's because I enjoy Marc Jacobs
beauty's so much I have so many products
that I really enjoy it and like
recommend hardcore especially the
highlighters and with the majority of
the lip products that I try for marcha
gives Beauty I really like so I got a
lot of tags on this a foundation let's
see here it says it is shameless
youthful look 24 hour long wear
foundation with SPF 25 this is medium
buildable coverage flashback free SPF an
exceptional hydration it's 29 shades
it says it's oil-free it does it's self
setting which means you get a fresh
natural finish that lasts all day this
is a lot of claims for a foundation holy
Toledo
let's see it's going to be $49 and it
says it'll be available a February 9th
ok so I will say I like a lot from where
Jacob sweetie like I said a lot of the
products the one thing that I have tried
from Marc Jacobs beauty and just
despised was a foundation it was the
remarkable foundation I believe is what
it was called so many people were raving
about it and I ended up getting a sample
of it and Jenna's hated it I think this
was a while ago
but I actually think that I tried it out
on camera and like I wanted to cry
because I was like my skin looks so
terrible it was so full coverage but
like the worst type of full coverage on
me and honestly maybe that foundation is
the one that like scarred me from full
coverage foundations because I felt like
after that I was like I'm just not
compatible with full coverage
foundations I don't know what that
foundation did to me but I looked
terrible and I I just did not like it at
all
and so that being said when I see a
foundation I'm like hmm I'm not a
hundred percent on this but what's
really interesting to me so it says it's
a long word foundation that typically
means it's going to be more full
coverage but it says it has exceptional
hydration
so I'm like I don't know because I need
exceptional hydration in my life right
now I'm pretty dry at this moment so I
then I'm kinda like what do i do do I
try it I will also say it I'll turn it
into the best photo in here as always
but I don't really love what the actual
product looks like it's like a squeeze
it looks like a like a squeeze tube and
I don't know if I really love that for
foundations I don't know I guess I would
just kind of prefer maybe something with
a pump but $49 I mean usually I try to
cut myself around fifty four foundations
I'm kind of interested in trying it out
but I just there's something to holding
me back and I think it's the remarkable
foundation I don't know maybe I should
just stick with the market goes products
that I know that I love I think this
would be one especially because of what
I'm dealing with out this moment I think
this is gonna be one that I'm gonna keep
my eye on like I'm gonna watch it but
I'm gonna wait for the reviews to come
in and see what people say and if people
make comments about it being like you
know just like the like overly full
coverage or you know you don't you know
the terms that they're gonna use I'm
gonna pass over it but if they say like
oh it's super comfortable or it's
exceptionally hydrating then maybe I'll
go for it and give it a shot because I
like foundations I like trying out
foundations I like Marc Jacobs beauty
overall foundation was just has me II
well then it says medium buildable
coverage I don't know and then then I'm
almost kind of like I feel like there's
just so many claims about this
foundation like how can they all be true
verdict is I'm gonna wait I'm gonna see
the reviews I'm gonna wait for people to
tell me I absolutely need this
foundation and then I'll consider it or
I'll wait till people tell me girl you
don't need it and then I think I'll be
fine not having it in my life
what do you think do you think that's
too many claims for a foundation are you
someone who loved the remarkable because
I know a lot of people did and are you
thinking about picking up the foundation
let me know a bunch of tags on this new
palette from Too Faced or it's not
really a new palette it's a revamped
palette from Too Faced so let me pull it
up here so the Too Faced natural matte
palette it looks like it's going to be
getting a makeover so
try to post a photo in here that has
like the older one and then what the
newer one looks like so basically it has
a it's getting a makeover so it's a
revamped packaging in all of that and
the actual shades have like a lace a
texture inside which is interesting I
think I saw limp post about this on
Instagram and she said it looks like a
tree branch fell into the shades which
not gonna lie that gives me a good
chuckle and says it also has a new
formula and it's now infused with cocoa
butter for a rich and creamy color that
last and last so what do I think about
it it also says that it's coming this
summer of 2018 I'm like why why are we
already taught like two phases one of
those brands that tells me what's coming
out in eight months and I'm like I don't
care what's coming out in the next three
years tell me what you have coming out
right now that's what I want to know
about I don't really I don't get the
marketing on that one because then it's
like I could when I saw it I was like
okay people are tagging me on it they
want me to talk about I'm like well it's
not coming out till summer so maybe I
should wait but then by the time it
comes out I don't know it's just weird
but I got so many tags I thought I would
talk about it you guys know I used to be
on a no buy from Too Faced because I
wasn't really feeling a bunch of things
that they were doing I have since lifted
my no buy so that's why I talk about
them more in my will I bite videos but I
just haven't I haven't bought anything
because nothing has like pulled me
enough to do it there's been a few
products that has made me pretty close
but so far I haven't but I'm not like my
no bi has been lifted so I'll say that
but I don't see a price or anything like
that but just what do I think about this
revamping in general I think is what
people wanted to know about and like I
want to say that I get it at the same
time I'm like I don't I just I don't
know if I really get it and then I don't
really understand the lace texture and
there as well I'm not sure that doesn't
really do anything for me that's I can I
can leave that as well the new formula
like okay I get it but I just I wouldn't
need this palette in my life you know
it's the natural matte palette so you
have all matte shades they tend to be
pretty neutral like I I have that and I
have a lot of it and it's just it's
nothing that called to me I saw it I'm
just kind of was like that well okay I
mean nothing about it drew it to me and
not even just because it's two-faced
like
that i'm i'll buy from them if something
catches my attention but like their
peachy matte palette would call my
attention over this palette so I don't
know but I would like to know your guys
I saw it like what do you think about
the makeup company's repackaging things
like this because I feel like more and
more like we're seeing that so much with
brands and it's something that's kind of
like been pushing me off for sure that
we're just kind of like repackaging this
and like we're taking old shades but
putting in them to one palette and then
selling it I don't know it kind of like
feeds into the overwhelmingness of how
much makeup releases there are and such
and then when you actually stop and
think about it you're like oh I have
four of those shades somewhere else and
now I just bought a palette with six
shades but I already have four that I'm
like shoot what did I just do wrong
because I've done that before I've done
that I'm guilty of it right here oh yeah
so I don't know I would like to know
what you guys think or are you okay with
ever you just like yeah I'd rather see
something new I don't know let me know
your thoughts but for me it just it
doesn't do anything for for me like I'm
not mad I don't hate it I'm not like
rawr
but I'm just kind of like alrighty and
then I'm pretty sure I didn't talk about
color pop it last week which means what
cook up this week the people gonna get
upset so this week we are talking about
the color pop luxe lipsticks they have
24 shades
they're a creamy matte finish says
they're going to be seven dollars each
on the colour-pop website it says the pr
box will also be available for purchase
I've seen color pop do this before I
personally think that's a little strange
but that's that's totally fine because
they charge you more money basically for
a box and I'm like mmm that's
interesting
and they are launching on January 31st
what do I think about these first of all
first of all I don't know what I thought
of the $7 and I know this might sound
really bad because seven dollars for a
lipstick is not that bad but the
colour-pop ultra matte and like ultra
statins are what six dollars so when I
saw that they were coming out with the
more regular lipstick formula I was like
oh they'll probably be like five dollars
or six dollars and then I said seven
dollars and I was like is it because you
put the word Lux in there you guys are
feeling that makeup companies like slap
the word luxury on there and then
they're like charge an extra dollar for
it hey like sometimes that's how I feel
so I don't know that was my first stop
at $7 for a lipstick still is not bad
it's still color pop affordable which is
fantastic and the packaging definitely
does look very pretty it does look more
luxurious if you will to 24 shades with
a creamy matte finish sometimes I get
creamy matte hmmm that doesn't always
work out and sometimes with matte
lipsticks I don't love them as much like
the Anastasia like regular lipstick
formula I really don't like because it's
a matte formula and it's like the
opposite of creamy when I try to put
them on it's just it's not good so it
makes me wonder will this be actually
more creamy or will it be matte so I
don't really know if I would love the
formula and for me personally I feel
like if I want like a creamy lipstick I
want a creamy lipstick if I want a matte
lipstick I'm doing a liquid lipstick
that's kind of how I am like I don't
need my creamy lipstick to be matte
because I'm just finding as I'm trying
out more and more it's just simply not
my preference so when I kind of thought
that through for a second I was like you
know what I don't know if I would
actually really love these ones
I'm just based on other lipsticks that
I've tried in the past that are kind of
like it but you know seven dollars isn't
bad and they have a ton of different
shades the 24 different shades so I like
the packaging and all of that but I'm
gonna skip over I have made a couple
color pop of purchases in the past year
I've got a couple pallets from them I
did purchase a lip product from them and
I kind of go in waves with color pop and
waves color pop where like I buy a lot
or I buy multiple orders and then I just
like trying to scale back and like right
now I'm kind of scaled back because I
just made my previous order so
interested but just not interested
enough even though it is a little bit
more affordable I just don't think I
need it right now if to know your
thoughts as well what do you think about
the whole luggage luxury thing do you
feel that with other brands as well or
is that just a me thing were you super
excited when you saw this you loved
everything like color pop or color pop
lips and you just absolutely have to try
it out definitely want to include some
color pop in here because when I didn't
last week people in the comments were
like hey color pop has all of these new
releases why are you not talking about
them and I said sorry next week but
after
the colour-pop Allah Lux lipstick so
that it's gonna do it for this week's
Olivia video guess what that is
everything for this week so will I buy a
video I really hope that you enjoyed

entertaining in some way again sorry if
