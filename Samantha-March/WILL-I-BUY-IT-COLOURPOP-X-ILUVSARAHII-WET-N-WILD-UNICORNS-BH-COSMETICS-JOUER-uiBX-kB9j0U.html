today's video is going to be a new will
I buy video I suppose Negril I buy
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them at living emails on planning
to buy them or if I'm planning to pass
over them and just kind of my thoughts
and opinions on each of these products I
guess that I do post these every single
Wednesday so I will have my playlist
down below if you want to catch any of
the past will i buy it video in addition
to the welly Brys i also post on
Thursday Sundays and Mondays so you do
get videos from me four times a week I
hope that you will consider hitting that
subscribe button to become part of Sam
and get notified for when I post my
future videos I also have a ton of
giveaways going on right now is my month
of May giveaway extravaganza so check
the description box down below I have a
really big giveaway celebrating my
latest book release that has seven
different winners and then I'm giving
away the Sephora give me some nude lip
collection the Kim kardashian-west and
credit cosmetics collection and the
Carli bybel new deluxe edition palette
with BH Cosmetics as well as one of her
bracelets from pronounced Beauty so
check the description box for all those
giveaways and hit the subscribe button
and then when we go ahead and get
started with this week's will I buy it I
got tagged a bit on Instagram for some
new highlight releases from
a g-way cosmetics I'm reading from the
tournament one Instagram page I
typically agree from her page quite a
bit from Tim share photo so I always
have her linked in my description box
down below highly recommend her page I
go to it many times a day to get updated
on new makeup releases so she will be
linked down below but from her page it
says it's a part of the summer 2017 a
skinny dip collection and it's inspired
by their lip toppers so they're new
highlighters will be skinny dip and tan
lines and they'll be available on May
21st I will have that linked up below in
the net will also insert a photo in here
as well so I didn't see a price on the
trend nude page but I believe the other
highlighters are $24 so I mean assume
these are going to be somewhere around
be $24 mark so I've tried about a g-way
a bit in the past and now I really don't
have much from them I was trying to
think of a few things and I think what I
have is mostly like deluxe sizes sample
sizes from like makeup subscription
boxes so I'm not like writer divers you
in any sort of the sense I haven't tried
their lip Stoppers I've never tried any
of their highlighters I hear really good
things about them I hear really good
things about you way but it just never
really like it gave me that pull I'm
going to go ahead and pass over these
because I'm still on my highlighter no
bye even though I keep breaking my own
rules but hey that's okay if I don't
really love something I can go ahead and
stick by my no buy but I bought a ton of
highlighters lately and I just don't
need I so needed a new highlighters and
especially for if they are the twenty
four dollars apiece I was kind of ready
for some new highlighters you know I
just thought the carli bybel palette
with the agent had what six highlighters
in there and the entire thing was
nineteen fifty even though they do look
cool I bet I would probably get along
with them just fine I still definitely
am on the highlight train I love
highlighting doing it every day going
crazy with it but I just don't need any
more new ones I have a ton of new ones
I'm starting to kind of forget to give a
love to my old ones so I'm wearing a
bucket and champion pot today so this is
a pretty old-school highlighter but yeah
I just don't need a new my collection is
twofold right now so I'm going to be
passing over at those you a cosmetics
new highlighters but let us know in the
comments down below do you plan to get
these if you have any other buy
highlights from joy cosmetics you
absolutely love them or if they're
something else at firm a way that you
would recommend that you think people
just absolutely have to have I would
love to know in the comments down below
a lot of pairings in a lot of different
places on this palette from BH Cosmetics
it is their Club Tropicana eyeshadow
palette is 28 different eyeshadows which
includes foiled eyeshadows and is only
$12.50 which is insane it'll be
available May 22nd on the BH website and
it is limited edition so again I'll have
a link down below in the photo insert it
here I mean this I mean the name says it
all in club traffic and a shadow pellet
definitely for sure tropical vibrant
colors just a super electric palette it
looks like twelve 5428 shadows I mean
for BH Cosmetics you definitely cannot
beat their prices and they do have some
really good product I know sometimes
like we love affordable things but
sometimes on the flip side rooms
is so affordable you're like ooh what is
it good when I first started getting it
to makeup
I was buying so much BH Cosmetics mostly
on recommendations from Carli bybel
which is why it's so cool that she
teamed up with them to make her two
different palettes but I was finding a
lot not only their eyeshadow palettes
but their brushes and I still recommend
their brushes to this day so I feel like
them I don't think their quality is like
absolutely top-notch the best but I mean
we can't expect that as those prices but
they are so really good and I really
would recommend them now I haven't tried
it much newer stuff from BH Cosmetics
besides the karlie palette one of the
reasons being was because you could only
get 3h through their website and I'm
more prone to purchasing from Upland
Sephora if I can because that dang
rewards point system but BH Cosmetics is
now sold in Alta which i think is really
cool I didn't see if this one for sure
if it will be on alpha I can have it
link down below if I do see that says it
will be there I don't know I don't know
why it wouldn't be but you know again I
don't know maybe it's because it's
limited-edition it might not be I'm not
sure but I can leave it in the comments
down below if I can confirm that it will
or will not be at Ulta but I think
that's really cool but you can now get
the H over at Alta because it is
definitely very affordable and I think
that's amazing but with all that said
I'm not going to get it I've just been
stocked up on eyeshadow palettes I've
just been in like eye shadow palette
overload so I know that I definitely
don't need them and it's also it's not
really like a mini palette it's very
cool it's very pretty it's definitely
unique it's like eye catching to me for
sure but those aren't the shades that I
reached for a time now I feel like this
would be a good palette to have if you
do want those shades like if you're just
having an often you're also I'm like you
know what I just want to put electric
green all over my lids and there's some
hot pink on my lower lash line then you
could definitely reach for this palette
and it's kind of nice that to have a
more affordable version of that if you
don't use those on a daily basis because
it's like wiping a ton of money for
something that you're not going to use
at I'm not really the only part that
we kind of consider this because there
has been times for like I really want to
like recreate this look but I don't have
a bright yellow in my collection like
just what am I going to do instead of
going out and spending you know $129
ones a Natasha just known a sunset
palette just to have that shade you can
spend 1250 and get the vh1 so that was
really the only thing that made me
consider like should I add this to my
collection but I just don't think I need
to and especially how much I have been
buying lately and only makeup but other
things and other things in real life
that I'm having to buy and things like
that I just know if I can like rein it
in right now spending wise if I can kind
of rein it in a little bit it's probably
going to be for the bus so that might be
something to consider if you are not one
who does wild and crazy makeup looks all
the time but sometimes we kind of want
to pop out of your comfort zone you can
definitely think about a palette like
this to have in your collection for
those times where you just need a few of
those crazier shades because I think
it's definitely a very good price
especially if you don't use a lot if
these are your kind of shades and you
absolutely love them then 12:50 I think
that you would give pretty decent
quality this is without my drying yet so
I can't say for sure but truly from what
I've tried from BH I think you would get
pretty good quality and I said some of
these are foil shades so that's pretty
cool the swatches looks pretty fun that
I saw online so it could be something
but I'm going to pass over the BH
Cosmetics Tropicana palette or right now
but let us know in the comments down
below are you super excited about this
are you big BH fan have you bought from
pH and Ulta I would just love to know
what you're thinking about this
Tropicana palette because a lot of
people tagged me on this so I think a
lot of you guys are excited so leave
some comments down below and let me know
what your thoughts are on this palette
okay so a lot of people were asking me
as well about the wet and wild or like
unicorn rainbow collection there's quite
a few things in here including some
different rainbow highlighters some
different loose pigments some lip
Stoppers a highlighter brush of course
they're all variable affordable for
$99.99 and because it is what wild looks
like it will be available May 20th at
beautycon new york super ghost anyone's
going to beautycon New York I'd love to
get to one one of these days
it says the box of the complete
collection will be available for 24
99 there and then on May 21st of the
available online at Ulta beauty and you
can get the box which must be the entire
collection for $29.99 or they will have
individual items and then on the website
May 22nd the box will be $29.99 and have
individual items so okay so one wild of
course you know very affordable I like
when wild I have quite a few things from
them they're to me they're kind of like
a hit or miss Fran like sometimes I've
really looked into sometimes I really
dislike things sometimes things are kind
of in the middle for me but the hangers
look interesting to me I kind of like
the bronze over the rainbow one I don't
really know why but that's so on
interest me or even the everlasting glow
like the unicorn glow just doesn't
really do anything for me like the
rainbow highlighter I don't know I just
like my regular old basic highlighters I
don't like really need all this crazy
fancy stuff but I'm going to pass over
them I just really don't feel like I
need them at all and then the pigment I
don't feel like I needed all the Lib
Stoppers no and then the brush I really
don't think that I need that either so I
don't know I know everybody loves this
like unicorn craze and I kind of bought
into it a little bit because I purchased
the Tarte brushes that might believe in
yourself brushes and those are like
unicorn style I don't really know the
make believe in yourself palette from
Target was supposed to be more like well
this will feel a lot more like mermaids
versus unicorns I don't know but really
I just feel like I'm not super into that
trend I know it is very trendy right now
and a lot of people are really diggin it
so a lot of different companies are
coming out with like unicorns and
rainbows and all this stuff we're just
super cool and I get it it's fun but
it's not really me or my style and then
the things that they release things that
they just really aren't my style either
so I mean probably the thing that I get
the most use out of would be the
highlighters and I'm a highlighter no
bye and I definitely don't need these
highlighters so I'm going to go ahead
and say no to the collection it just
doesn't really like do anything for me
it doesn't get me excited it's just not
my like personal style or my personal
buzz so they got going on right now so I
will need anything but I know as a lot
of people are huge went wild
and you don't probably own the unicorn
trying to sell it so it's doing so well
so let me know the comments down below
what you think what are you getting let
me know what you think about the unicorn
trend like are you totally on it it's
your makeup collection so legs off in
unicorn right now I'm starting to no but
let us know if you're getting anything
from went wild also let me know if
you're going to beauty kind of New York
so I can be really jealous of you that's
all best really that's my only reason I
just want to know who I should be
jealous of so let us know a lot of times
and a lot of snapchat questions about
this one too so I love so that ye or
Karen she is a Instagrammer in youtube
or she is teaming up with colour-pop and
coming out with the collaboration so I
saw the collaboration come out I fell at
the box at first but now it actually has
the details
photos and swatches I'll do my best to
leave the best ones that I can find down
below but there's going to be two
different eyeshadow palettes so it's
going to be an ultra matte lip plus a
lip pencil and ultra satin lip plus a
lip pencil and ultra co-op a lip gloss a
lip pencil and that all just the colors
just eyeshadows and the lipsticks I
think it is yes I'm pretty sure it's
just the two different eyeshadow
palettes and those three lippies with
the lip pencils it'll be available in
May 24th at 10:00 a.m. at PST of this
moment in time I don't see prices on
them but if I have prices before this
video goes up I'll go ahead and leave
them linked down below on the trend mood
it says update will be available in a
bundle and lip products and pellets sold
individually CMV eye shadow pellets
first they really caught my attention
they really did really both the palettes
I thought looked pretty neat and maybe
be lighter one I'm not sure what that
name is but it has like a lighter brown
shade and a real like metallic paint and
then a real kind of like creamy white
pink from looking at the swatch that one
looks really intriguing to me but the
other one has that like bright pop of
like hot pink a really pretty kind of
purple some nice look as masks hmm okay
and then moving on to the list I do not
like the ultra glossy lips at all from
colour-pop I do not like them one bit so
I would definitely want to do that and
then it looks like the ultra matte lip
maybe is going to be a really dark lip
I'm just trying to tell by the swatches
because I can definitely tell which one
the Colossus it looks like the really
dark one is going to be the matte
formula and then kind of like a nudey
pink is going to be the satin lip I do
let the satin lips from colour-pop I
like the scent and the ultra matte so
what I'm thinking what I'm thinking is
that maybe I'll get one eye shadow
palette and then the ultra satin lip if
it is that like nude shade that's what I
think I'm going to go for but now but
I'm still thing you're marketing both
eyeshadow palettes even though I don't
need them but I've talked recently about
the color pop eyeshadows and how they
really surprised me I think I mentioned
them and one of my fellow appalled
because I actually got a package from my
friend Casey be kinda like for my
birthday ish she sent me a box of
goodies and and there was the color pop
shows which I'm actually wearing on my
eyes today believe it or not I did not
even plan that I'm wearing the color pop
pressed eyeshadows and I was super
impressed with these I was waiting into
buying them because I just love them
like buying into it out like I don't
know I know maybe it'll be okay
and I was super impressed so I send that
video I'm totally down I would love to
buy more color top of the press shadows
from colour-pop and so then I see these
and I'd like the shades so I don't know
if I only get one I think I'm going to
go the one with like the lighter shades
because I think I to wear it more but I
might grab both and a lip I do like
Karen or I love to eat I didn't really
follow her until I started really
getting on snapchat and I was seeing her
on my dezzy and KD snapchat and I was
like who was that like gorgeous that's
insane she was like she's so beautiful
and then I started bawling on Instagram
and then she just recently started a
YouTube channel I think she was always
just like the Instagrammer and then she
just recently started YouTube and I
start probably her on YouTube she was
really cool tutorials and I really like
her blogs as well sometimes she's a
little this is a little out there for me
personally but that's okay because we're
all different but I enjoy watching her
and I think she has really good
tutorials and I think she's just
beautiful and I enjoy that she's teaming
up with colour-pop as well a little bit
more affordable brand
like I said I'll have the prices listed
down below if I can find them but I have
a feeling they won't like break the bank
expensive so I think I'm going to go
ahead and do one or two the eyeshadow
palettes and then I think the ultra
satin lip so I'm excited let me know
what you guys think of this collection
again I got a lot of tags on it so I
think a lot of you guys are pretty
excited for it do you follow
I love 7.e what do you think of her are
you excited for this collab as well is
she like one of your Ryder guys I'd love
to know even though I don't feel like
I'm like read or die with her the
collection just really did catch my eye
and I do like her a lot and I would like
to support and again I think it's going
to be a more affordable option to
support so that's kind of what makes it
a little bit easier for me and I wanted
to get some new colour-pop Prashad oh so
kind of all of that together it made me
have my eye on this collection but let
