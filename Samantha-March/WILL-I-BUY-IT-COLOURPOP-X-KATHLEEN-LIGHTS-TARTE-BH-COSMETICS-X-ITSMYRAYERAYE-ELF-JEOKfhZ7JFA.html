today's video is going to be a new well
I buy it I post my volley by videos
every single Wednesday or I'm chatting
about some new makeup releases and
lunches letting you know a little bit
about them and then also talking about
if I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them and as always I have a lot of
chat about this week so why don't we go
ahead and get started alright so I had
my list I'll plan this weekend I worked
on it I was looking at the new releases
I was looking at my list looking at my
tanks and I was like got it got my four
products I'm talking about and then just
this morning as I'm sitting down to film
which is on Tuesday trend mood posted
new releases on our Instagram and all
these new tags came through and I was
like like this happens every week every
week so I decided to switch it up
because I felt like I was getting a lot
of tags on a couple of the new products
that were just posted this morning so
the first one that I'm going to talk
about is a new eyeshadow palette from
elf cosmetics this one is called the mad
format palette jewel pop it's $10 for 10
at different shades it says for bold or
subtle islands and has a satin matte
texture okay so I feel like elf is I
feel like they're mad format pallets
have gotten really really good reviews
and hype in the past I've never
purchased one for myself or owned one
for myself I did actually buy the mad
format palette I remember buying it and
then I put it into a giveaway and I
remember that was one that I was like
not gonna put it in the giveaway I'm
gonna keep it with me and then at the
end I was like you bought it for a
giveaway like don't be selfish well so
that's the only time I've actually
purchased the mat for matte palette
didn't keep it myself though and so when
I saw this new one coming out I mean I
saw the tanks coming in and I saw they
had the new matte for my eyeshadow
palette I instantly got intrigued and
then when I saw it's the jewel pop I was
like okay I still like it but I still
think I would like the matte format like
their previous one that's more of like
the Browns and the neutrals because
that's just what I'm attracted to and I
can't help it I know I know we all have
these palettes and everybody releases
these palettes but they're my favorite
look at my eyes today like I tried to
throw some glitter on there because you
know it's December and all that but that
is what I am most attracted to when it
comes to eyeshadow palettes so I feel
like this one looks really cool though
there's a beautiful picture on trend
mood that I will have here I will have
her Instagram list down below there's a
beautiful photo that I'm looking at
now with like this hot orange in there
that looks incredible there's a
beautiful green in there it looks
fantastic I definitely did a double-take
that I was definitely drawn to it and
for only $10 I mean how do you really go
wrong like how do you really go wrong I
think it's amazing that elf can put out
so many new releases so many good
releases and still keep their prices so
affordable because that is something
we're not really seeing what drugstore
and affordable brands these days so I
think that's amazing I don't think I
will get it for right now I think this
is gonna be one of those that kind of
like stays on my radar and I'll have to
think about it basically the biggest
reason is is I bought a lot of makeup
over Black Friday Cyber Monday it's true
I have no haul coming up I just have a
couple more packages that I'm waiting to
get and then I will film my haul video
but I bought I bought a lot of makeup so
I'm kind of like okay
reel it in reel it in Samantha and I
have a lot of new eyeshadow palettes I'm
kind of I think I even talked about last
week how I said I'm just a little bit
overwhelmed with eyeshadow palettes
right now I'm trying my best to use them
as many times as I can so I can get my
review videos out there for them I'm
just feeling a little overwhelmed at
this point I think if I brought in a new
eyeshadow palette it wouldn't get the
the love that it deserves because I'm
trying to focus on these other ones
these other five or six eyes shadow
pellets that I've recently got either
bought myself or gotten in PR I'm trying
to use those as often as I can to get
reviews on them so it just doesn't feel
right bringing in a new eyeshadow
palette at this time but I feel like I
will keep this one on my radar though
and again for only $10 like if I'm
strolling through argot at some point
and I see it pop out I mean this might
be something that's kind of like it
impulse buy it does look really nice and
again I heard really good things about
the matte format palettes in the past so
I feel like this one would probably be
pretty good quality as well but I'm too
overwhelmed right now okay I have two
over well this isn't a brand new release
but it is still pretty new and it's been
on my list for quite some time I really
did want to chat about it this is a
release from BH Cosmetics and it's my
ray-ray so they came out with a 21 color
eyeshadow highlighter and contour
palette and then also a nine piece brush
set I'm looking at the BH Cosmetics
website right now and it looks like the
highlight and contour palette is
actually sold out so that's kind of a
bummer
the nine piece of brush set is still
available for $24 I will have that one
listed down below this is one I started
getting tax on it a while back and I was
kind of in that mode where it it gave me
the double take I was like what that
looks really interesting
I love face ballads I love contour
palette highlight palette like I love it
all but so I I was instantly pretty
drawn to it and BH Cosmetics is really
known again for their affordability some
other pieces now can also be found at
Ulta again you're getting all of this
all those eyeshadows and contour shades
for 2250 like that's freaking amazing I
think that's awesome it looks like there
is fifteen matte and shimmer eyeshadows
it says in a silky blendable formula
with rich color payoff three contour
shades and three highlight shades so it
is sold out right now so I wouldn't be
able to buy even if I wanted to it was
one where I kind of like talked to
myself out of it I was like no I don't
feel like I need that one you know again
I'm overwhelmed right now I'm not sure
but it was kind of one that like kind of
like niggle that me back here like do
you need that one and then I watched kdr
luster like she did a tutorial with it
not too long ago on her youtube channel
I love the look that she created I had
out like it kind of like talked me back
into wanting to buy the palette and then
I was like mmm what should i do what
should I do
and I decided to stand firm what kind of
my initial thought of like no keep in
mind you just bought a lot you keep
saying you're overwhelmed but then you
keep buying makeup like stand firm if I
was able to talk myself out of it at one
point I'm like just stay strong now
looking it is sold out right now at the
BH website so they do have a little link
there that says click to notify me when
it gets restocked so I'm sure it's
coming back in stock I'm not positive if
it will be at Ulta beauty or not but
again I feel this is another one that's
maybe gonna stay on my radar right here
like maybe when it kind of calms down I
mean does it just buying makeup ever
calm down but maybe when things kind of
calmed down a little bit
I will glance back at it who got the
palette who wants to get the palette and
who is gonna put it on your like maybe
for the future type of wish list let us
know so this is another one that trend
mood just posted about this morning and
the tags on Instagram started coming in
like oh man tart released something else
again today
like I love tart and I buy so much from
tart and I enjoy a lot from tart but man
they put out a lot I just I can't even I
can't even handle it okay so we got
another new release from Tarte cosmetics
this is the foil finger paints a shadow
palette from the rainforest of the sea
collection it says it includes new
textured soil formulas with three warm
toned foil eyeshadows with a crushed
velvet texture that melts on the lids
will the split pan iridescent
and silver sheer sparkling shades can be
worn alone or layered as top coats
alrighty so you have a three foil finish
shades and a split panel with two shades
so basically you have like three big
shades and then into smaller shades I
mean I'll have the picture inserted here
as well and all of that is $39 and I
felt like when I was getting a lot of
these tags on Instagram a lot of people
were specifically asking me about the
price do I think it is worth it for that
price tag because five shades for $39
that is pretty pricey I totally get it
so the packaging is absolutely gorgeous
on this I will say that right away the
packaging looks beautiful the palette
the shiny the jewel tones like it looks
freaking gorgeous don't get me wrong
there it says right now looking up with
genuine website it says it's early
access a vib Rouge and so I'm not sure
when it will become available for
everybody else I'm assuming in the next
couple weeks here so but any other links
or date information I will have in the
description box down below along with
all the other products I'm chatting
about I know right away I saw it and I
was like yes looks interesting but I
just kind of knew right away I was gonna
pass over this one I don't really like
buying just shimmer palettes or just
metallic palettes just glitter palettes
it's not what I'm necessarily drawn to I
really like all-inclusive palettes
they're definitely my favorite and I'm
the same way I was just talking about
this in one of my previous videos I
think it was my makeup monthly then I'm
such like a palette lover I love going
into one palette to complete my entire
eyeshadow look I like going into one
face palette for my setting powder for
my bronzer for my contour for my
highlight like that is how I like to do
my makeup I don't know what it is and I
feel like
it's something kind of like recently
about me but I don't like tearing apart
my entire office and all of my drawers
and my shelves to create my makeup look
like that is what I realized that I like
and I'm not saying I do that every day
because of course that's totally not
possible like today I have a pallet on
and then I have some glitter on from
something else at I don't feel like I'm
drawn to something like this especially
when it's only the five shades it's just
like how often would I actually reach
for that or would it just kind of like
collect dust on my shelves and I feel
like it would probably call it the sand
for $39 I feel like I could put $39
towards and I showed a palette that I
really really want and I'm really
intrigued at I could put it towards a
lipsticks that I mean yeah foundation
there's so many other things that I
could put the $39 towards the colors in
there they look really beautiful and I
like kind of like the assortment of
colors there's this really beautiful you
know kind of red burgundy shade in there
and what looks to be like a really nice
a champagne color too I mean I like the
color selections and I think they look
pretty I like tart eye shadows I thought
they would look nice on the eyes but for
me and for my personal makeup tastes I
don't think I would get a ton of use out
of this one so it's better for me to put
my money elsewhere but you know I I
completely understand that we all have
different makeup vibes a different
makeup taste so what did you think when
you saw this one from Tarte we were
surprised to see another new release
from Tarte cosmetics putting this one on
your list I would love to know and have
your feedback down below but this is one
that I felt felt pretty confident and
saying no to so lastly I want to talk
about the new collaboration between
kathleenlights and colour-pop when I
posted my will I buy a video last week I
got so many comments and they're like
what about the kathleenlights colourpop
collab she had just posted that video of
the morning that I posted my will hit by
a video so so many people were asking me
in that video when I thought about the
collection I promise promise promise I
will chat about it next week
so the new collaboration between a
kathleenlights and colour-pop they
released an eyeshadow palette called
Dream Street and I also released some
lipsticks as well so the lipsticks are
in Rev I know Kathleen calls it Rev I
believe it's pronounced and a French
name for the full name but she says
around I must say Rev also dreamy and
moonchild the Dream Team a lip bundle is
$18 or you can't
by them individually I know that Rev and
dreamy are currently sold out on the
collar pop website the last time I
looked and believed moonchild which is
the gloss I believe that one is still
available at the time that I'm filming
at least and also the eyeshadow palette
is still available as well that one is
called dream Street and you get 16 of
their pressed eyeshadows there's six
mats of four metallics or shimmery
shades and one satin and $16 if I did
not say that so I was really excited
when I saw this I really like Kathleen
lights she's been one of my favorite
youtubers for a very long time one of
the first that I started watching I
bought a lot of her collaborations
especially with color pop color pop is a
very affordable brain so nice when
youtuber is that team up with affordable
brains because then it's like you can
support them at the same time without
feeling like you're just like destroying
your bank account one makeup release at
a time so I think that's really cool so
I decided to pick up the eyeshadow
palette I did order it it's not to me
yet but I did decide to get the
eyeshadow palette I watched the swatches
and I just I just was drawn to it I
really liked the the color pop pressed I
shadow I liked them so much more than
their original super shock shadows and I
believe I mentioned the color pop
shadows I think it was in my holiday
gift guide maybe I was recommending
color pop eyeshadow palettes because
they are affordable and they're really
nice quality too and I said I want even
more to ask my collection well I'm doing
a really good job of that I did just
recently purchased all I see is magic
palette I talked about that in passive
Ally by a video I said I want to buy it
I did buy it and then I decided to
purchase the kathleenlights I was like I
kind of went back and forth because I
was like I don't need both like if
kathleenlights already came out first I
would have bought it and then I would
have talked to myself out of all I see
is magic but it's fine they were $16
know all I see is magic I think was $20
kathleenlights was 16 like I know it's
not like the most expensive but still
like this is why I'm feeling super
overwhelmed with eyeshadow palettes
because I just bought another to myself
but from colour-pop so there's that but
I did buy it I just I was attracted to
it I like the eyeshadows like I feel
like I'm getting good quality not
everything with color talk to me is
great quality I don't love everything
but I do like this eyeshadow formula so
I decided
that up and at $16 it caught my
attention I did decide to pass over all
the lip colors I actually had talked to
myself into Rev which was kind of like
that hot orange reddish shade but I
ended up talking myself out of it so I
was like I don't wear those shades a lot
and I actually have a few I think I have
a liquid lipstick and a regular lipstick
in that shade I don't wear it a ton and
especially for this time of year I like
I feel like I was wearing a more in like
the spring summer so I'm like you
probably don't need it and color pop
lips are not my favorite actually I
think that the ultra mattes especially
but even sometimes the alter sentence I
feel like they go bad very quickly
they're super affordable which is great
but for me I have a really big lipstick
collection so sometimes it's not worth
it even to buy lipsticks that are
cheaper if they are gonna go bad right
away and then on top of all of that when
I placed my all I see is magic palette I
bought a freaking colour-pop lipstick I
don't want to talk about it okay like I
talked myself on things and then I'm
like yeah no but this one but this one
so because I did that especially I was
like okay you probably don't need this
other eyeshadow palette but don't add
more lipsticks on top of it you don't
need to do it so I bought something else
I'll show you guys in the holla - um hot
mess I'm a hot mess what can I say I I
don't I don't know what to say this is
why I'm trying so hard to talk myself
out of the other products that don't
turn my attention or don't immediately
grab me so hard like I'm trying to
evaluate and like put them in order of
what I really want what I really need
cuz for whatever reason I'm just buying
a lot of makeup right now so I did gets
palette decided to skip over the
lipsticks I actually don't like the
color pop lip glosses I know a lot of
people have been recommending them to me
lately and I don't like them I've tried
them I've tried several different shades
and colors of them and I do not like
that formula at all I've got a huge lip
gloss person anyway so I decided to pass
on the lipsticks I was being good I just
declutter dal out of my color pop
collections like I said I feel like
because we're going bad so I was like
nope don't get the lipsticks but I did
for just the palette I'm really excited
to get it in I'm excited to support I'm
excited to have a new color pop
eyeshadow palette been wanting to pick
up more and add some more to my
collection they said the palette is
still in stock and then also the
lipgloss is still in stock so I will
have any links down below as well but
that's what I pick
from the kathleenlights and color pop
collection and I'm really excited to get
that package in did you guys get
anything are you still planning on
giving something did you need a pass
over it are you buying too much right
