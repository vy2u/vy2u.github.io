today's video is going to be a new
little will I buy it I plus my villa by
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about some new makeup releases
and lunches letting you know a little
bit about them and then letting you know
if I'm going to pick them up or probably
passing over them like I said I do post
my Bolivia's every single Wednesday so
I'll have my playlist a link down below
in case you want to check out any of my
past will I buy it
I am currently uploading a video every
single day in addition to a live chat on
Tuesdays at 4 p.m. CSP if you ever want
to come by and chat live with me and
some of my friends so if you do enjoy
getting a daily content on makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button before you
leave but if you want to see this week's
edition of my reel I buy it
why don't we go ahead and get started so
I did get a couple times on some a new
morphe brushes products looks like they
released some brow products so we have
the micro brow pencil which is $4.99 s
in five different shades so it's a
double ended precious pencil screen from
the 21 instagrams I'll have her
Instagram page listed down below and
then they also release the highlighter
pencil it says to shape contour and
sculpt for your eyes it's in four
different shades and it's 399 so these
are available now on the morphe website
so i'll have them listed down below and
i'll have some photos insert it in here
first off those prices are pretty
freakin good I mean I know morphine is
affordable but $4.99 399 like doesn't
seem bad at all I just thought the
anasazi abroad windows $21 on furniture
is also by up on my eyebrows too tightly
that's pretty affordable I'm going to
pass right now on the morphe brow
products I might try their micro brow
pencil in the future that's something
that I kind of like to see some reviews
on because I'm just not great with brows
and very much a brow beginner I
basically have really only used a
benefit brow products and I've been
trying to branch out and explore I
recently found one from thrive cosmetics
and I'm absolutely loving and then like
I said I did buy the a BH bra with I'd
like to see a couple reviews and see
what people are saying about this brow
pencil because that's kind of why I
bought the anasazi brow is because of
course it's like a super hyped product
and everybody loves it so I'll probably
wait get a few reviews so like I said
I'm just not a big brow person like when
I see a brow pencil come out I'm not
like
yes waiting for that to release so it
just not really like my cup of tea right
now but if a lot of people have a lot of
really good things to say about it $4.99
for a brow pencil I don't think is a bad
price at all and I would buy it if the
reviews are pretty positive the
highlighter pencil I just don't think I
need something like that I have to
benefit a high brow I think I also have
one from thrive cosmetics I want to say
I even have one from elf cosmetics but I
barely barely touch them I typically use
eyeshadows to highlight my brow bone and
versus reaching for like my high brow or
anything like the highlighter pencil so
I thought I'd pass over that regardless
but I'm curious about the morphe brow
pencil it's fun to see how they're
expanding I really do like more PFI a
lot from them but at this time I'm just
not super interested especially after
buying the brow Wiz and wanting to give
that you know a couple weeks of use and
trying it out and seeing what I think
but as always there's a fly flying
around that is very nice you should go
away now but I'd love to hear your
thoughts on it these new releases a from
morphe in the comments down below
quite a few tags on the new fall
collection so crazy to be saying fall
collection fall well I'm going to be
tags on the a fall collection from wet
and wild beauty it is called their
midnight mermaid collection maybe I
think I'll have some photos in here down
below but they have metallic liquid
eyeshadows for $4.99 new mega lapse
metallic liquid catsuit lipsticks for
$4.99 also 3 mega liners three colors
for 399 and then also on make a glow
highlighter which is going to be $6.99
you can buy the bundle at beautycon for
$29.99 or the bundle at wet and wild
Beauty at 3499 this is a limited edition
it will first be available at beautycon
on August 12 which beautycon aside New
York San Fran I don't remember because I
don't get to go to any of them live in
Iowa healthfirst I've beautycon August
12 online also beauty August 13th online
of wet and wild Beauty August 14th and
in store September 1st again limited
edition and I will have all that
information listed down below
okay so let's dissect a collection real
quick the metallic liquid eyeshadows I
just don't feel like I need I don't feel
like I would use them a lot I actually
have a couple that are similar to that
like I know I
Maybelline one and I know I have another
one too I just was organizing last night
and I saw it I was like I never reach
for those so I just don't think I would
really get a lot of use out of them
they'll liquid catsuit lipsticks I mean
only $4.99 which isn't bad but they are
metallic and I'm just not into metallic
I've never really caught on to the
metallic vibe this is not really in my
style and I actually really disliked the
liquid Kathy lipsticks I tried like five
different shades and I like any of them
so they are just not for me the mega
liner is in three different colors again
it's kind of like this more metallic
still kind of on like the mermaid
unicorn type of theme which I was kind
of hoping that we were like getting over
we were getting past that theme because
it never was my vibe either I know it
was a ton of people's vibe so like no
shade if that was your vibe it just
didn't happen to be my personal vibe so
I would pass over that the midges a
little highlighter honestly that was the
only thing that kind of caught my
attention at mostly just because I hear
so many good things about the wet and
wild highlighters I pass over them I
pass over them but I sent more and more
I keep seeing how great they are and my
friend liveth and Liz left her makeup
she did like her glow down showdown
I can leave her video listed down below
but she compared a bunch of the wet and
wild new highlighters to high-end
highlighters and like the wet wild ones
kept looking so good they were so
inexpensive and I was like should I try
to find them but I remember my issue
with the Wet n Wild highlighters was at
first I could never find them and I just
finally just give up like one never mind
like it shouldn't be this hard friend
makeup right so that's why I didn't buy
them but now I'm seriously reconsidering
it but I think that I would still go for
one of those other ones with more on the
square packaging my pass over all of it
I'm so sorry
alright pass over all of it I know a ton
of people love went wild and get so
excited for these new collections but
it's just not my personal makeup style
let us know what you're thinking and
what you want to pick up from this new
collection from one well gotten so many
questions on what I think about this new
release from pure cosmetics are coming
out with the My Little Pony the movie
collection alright so I'm mostly just
going to ask about the eyeshadow palette
so that's under my touch on in
disability but video but it is a
collection so it has the eyeshadow
palette for $29 lip glosses for $16 each
a magic of friendship set
three all-in-one glowstick for face eyes
and lips
that's $22 okay the brush set and the
pouch which is six pieces is $49 it'll
be available August 10th on their
website and okay so yeah like I said I'm
just going to talk about the eyeshadow
palette so I'll have a photo listed down
here so it's from My Little Pony the
movie collection and I'm about to make a
bold statement when I say I'm not really
all that familiar with My Little Pony
like I know what it is I know what it is
but how does I seen the movie I'm pretty
sure that's a negative um so I don't
know sometimes when I see things like
that I can't get super excited because
I'm not like nostalgic for my little
pony
cuz that's older right you guys are
gonna have to tell me everybody was so
mad at me when I said I didn't know who
Sonic the Hedgehog was like I don't know
guys I am out of touch with reality now
because I don't want to turn a TV I was
the same way as a little kid promise you
like I was always I us because I was
always reading you guys know I'm a huge
book nerd I write books a huge book meri
I'm always always reading I didn't watch
a lot of like TV or movies even as a
little kid so like in one of my will I
bias when I said I didn't know the Sonic
the Hedgehog was everyone was like oh so
I'm pretty sure I'm going to get the
same thing with them say little floaties
so the whole collaboration collection
thing doesn't really hype me up the
eyeshadow palette looks really cool
definitely reminds me of the trolls on
my car my trolls palette well this is
what it looks like so it looks really
similar like packaging and stuff but it
looks like they have a hot pink shade in
there that looks really similar to the
hot pink shade in here they have kind of
a lighter pink shade then I see
something similar it looks like they
have almost like a you know from the
photo it's a little hard to tell but
like a hot orange that looks similar to
the one in here there's a blue looks
similar to the woman here but I just
feel like there's a lot of similar
shades so I don't what I need to My
Little Pony palette if I have the troll
salad I don't know I mean I've only seen
a couple photos but I remember each time
I looked at a photo I thought of my 12
palette now I
love this palette I recommended this
palette over and over and over again and
when it came back because I think it was
for my condition and then they brought
it back for a while or maybe it's still
back out if it is I'll list this down
below as well that the formulation was
great of the pigmentation in this
palette like I use this palette a lot
just looking at the My Little Pony I
used to work a see so many similarities
and it looks like there's a really nice
gold in there and like some of the other
shimmers looks really pretty and that
mint green color is very pretty but I'm
not sure if it's different enough for me
to be able to be like yes I should get
that too you know what I'm saying and
you know the Jack and Hill palette is
new to me I just got the subculture
palette I'm planning on buying something
that I'm going to talk about next that
has to do with eyeshadow so I don't
think I need it I don't think $29 the
bad price at all and I think if I didn't
on the trolls palette I would be more
willing to be like yeah I'll buy that
but I'm just not gravitating towards it
a lot I don't know if it made me do a
full like double tank it kind of made me
do like a slow-mo take you know I was
like I don't know if I'm into it but
should I be into it okay I would say
it's like if you love the colors in here
or you just like well my little pony $20
I don't think it's bad and if the
formulation is like the troll spell it I
think you'd be so super happy with it
and just look like some of the new
eyeshadow palettes that I have and then
with owning the trolls I think I need it
so bummed because I do think it's really
pretty I do really like pure did you
love my little pony that's what I really
want to know like I don't even really I
mean I do want to know if you're going
to get the palette but I want to know
more if you're really mad at me now that
I'm not familiar with my little pony
just just give it to me I could take it
I know that you guys have no idea if I'm
going to toggle on next if the Katy does
a collab with dohsa colors home and I
was excited for this oh my goodness I
recently just posted my youtubers that I
love to watch and youtubers on 11
general and Katie Ann does they were
both on there and I mentioned how
extended I was for the collab I was on
my snapchat the night of like
initial release party like just waiting
and waiting because like who are they
collab with and I totally should have
known dose of colors because I've seen
them hanging out with Anna the dose of
colors honors I should have known I know
how much they love dose of colors
especially they're like what lipsticks
like duh I should have guessed dose of
colors I think it's really really cool
that they're teaming up what's don't
maybe not more like a bigger breed
because one of the first brands that
went through my head was made me tart
that don't allow trips with pirates off
like on my song part it was really cool
to see more of an indie brand even
though does the colors is now sold at
Ulta but you know they started out as
indie brand I think I was so classify
them as indie this time touched the
snapchats of the initial party that they
had which I thought was amazing instead
of having the traditional release party
with like the bloggers and the influence
areas and all of that they did a
giveaway and 200 people got to come to
this party like regular old people like
me I enjoyed that giveaway I was like if
I win I am somehow figuring out a way to
make it to LA like I don't care I'm
going to make it to that party somehow
and then those 200 people each gotta
bring a plus-one so they have 400 people
get to come and preview the collection
first before you know influencers and
consider D bloggers I thought that was
so cool and one thing that I mentioned
in that the youtubers that I love to
watch when I talked about JD and desi is
that I feel like they understand how
huge the support is like they get it
from their squad tour and then now just
what I saw with them doing that
pre-party they get it and that is so
inspiring to me as someone who's very
new and her YouTube journey to see like
how down-to-earth relatable and just how
much that they understand appreciate and
then want to give back to their
supporters that's something I hope that
I never ever lose it's something I
always hope that I can keep in the back
of my mind would have to women like that
I think is such a good example and I
hope a lot of other people catch on to
that because I think that's why there's
a part of the reason why they are so
loved in the community I also think
their friendship is mega gold as someone
who has had a lot of ups and downs with
her
friends with our girlfriends it's been
really super inspiring to watch their
friendship - and how I was so proud of
one another they are because that was
one of my issues with a friendship that
I just had to end recently was that I
couldn't get any sort of support from
the girls who was calling me her best
friend like I mean I would have
something good happen to me and I would
say it and she would follow up with
something better that happened to her
every single time so to see them to
support each other and hype each other
up they literally be each other's type
man's for when it came to lustreless
being on e or does he releasing
sunglasses with key like they were each
other's biggest supporters besides their
husbands and I thought that was amazing
amazing so I was so excited to see them
do a collaboration together I just was
freaking pumped just pumped to see it
with those two colors - and with someone
who they consider a friend like awesome
I love it cool amazing
I'll have a photo in here in case you
haven't seen it but their collection
will be a lip gloss it's going to be a
clear gloss of gold sparkle of $15 on
that week what lipsticks there is two
different shades and those are going to
be $18 each and then nude six that
that's it this is a new formula which is
creamy matte they're going to be sixteen
dollars each and then eyeshadow palette
for $28 and then also two different
highlighters $28 each now obviously I've
just explained why I love Katy and
Debbie I really enjoyed dosent colors
they're new or brand to me I just
purchased from them this year at the
marvelous moths pellet I highly highly
recommend the liquid lipsticks all about
them but even though I'm so super hyped
I'm not going to purchase the whole
collection and I'll explain why but I'm
not going to purchase the whole
collection but I will be purchasing
items from it so the lip gloss just
doesn't do anything for me I'm not a
huge gloss person and I have enough lip
glosses that I don't feel like I need
another lip gloss especially with how
often I don't reach for a lip gloss it
just wouldn't make a ton of sense for me
the liquid lipsticks I was super excited
about because like I said I love the DOS
with a lipstick formula but but the
shades are not me the shades are not me
they're called hot hot fire and Savage
and one is like the
orange red and then another one is a
very deep like oxblood color and those
are just not my shade I'm so
disappointed like a super super bum but
the lipsticks are and I have been
wanting to try their lipsticks it does
say this is a new formula but I have
been wanting to try the dose of colors
regular lipsticks just to see how I like
them there are sixteen dollars each
which I don't think is a bad price
honestly I think I'm going to get both
no shade and more creamer please love
the names I think I want to try both
sides I'll probably gonna get both I
love nude lipsticks I really wish there
would have been one nude liquid lipstick
and then one nude regular lipstick and
then might got a cool color for liquid
lipstick and then one I don't know I was
so bummed but I just you know I am a
consumer and I spent a lot of money on
makeup and even though I want to support
and like buy all of the makeup I know
that I can at the same time so you know
try to I try to be cognizant of that and
keep in mind with what I'm actually
going to wear and also the highlight I'm
going to pass over the highlights that
took me the longest to say no to because
they look amazing their swag oh and me
Renee I think it's how you say it but
$28 for a highlighter for one highlight
is so expensive and I'm on a highlight
no buy like I'm trying not to buy any
highlights and I already talked myself
into buying a wet and wild hell I didn't
hear but that's going to be like four
bucks compared to 28 so the highlights
took me a bit to say no to but
definitely the thing that I'm most
excited about if the eyeshadow palette
is a quad and the names and they're so
cute they're named after their dogs I
just love it it did say that two of the
shades you have to look at my choker
we're going down home guys it did say
that two of the shades you do want to
like at least have a drop of the water
and use them so that was only part that
I was kind of like okay okay but you
know whatever that's why that's fine but
I'll do it if I can make the subculture
palette work for me I can get my finger
in some water and make these eyeshadows
work for me but all the shades look so
pretty there all very like intense like
metallic G type of shades there's no
mattes in there but they kind of
explained in their videos I'll have a
video link down below where they explain
the collection about you know how you
have your matte shades that you love you
have the eyeshadow palettes that have
the maps in it and because this was just
a quad they wanted each and every shade
to be like poppin
higher and I think that they killed it
the swatches that I've seen the looks
that I've seen look amazing
so even though I really love them and
I'm super stoked for this collection I
also I'm trying to be a real person at
the same time and I know I can't buy
everything so the things that excites me
the most of the eyeshadow palette and
then the nude lipsticks so that is what
I'm driving towards I'm going to really
try to stay strong and not buy a
highlight but will try to stay strong I
can't promise anything but the eyeshadow
palette and the nude lipstick I'm super
hyped about so the collection is going
to be available on August 14th online at
Joseph colors and Namie's so I will have
that information as well as like the
prices and everything I'll list it down
below but I'm very excited for it I
really wish I could purchase the whole
collection just to support but I can't
and you know I of course want to buy the
makeup that I'm going to wear the most
and those are the items that I think
that I will wear the most but I would
love to hear your thoughts were you
super excited about this collection
