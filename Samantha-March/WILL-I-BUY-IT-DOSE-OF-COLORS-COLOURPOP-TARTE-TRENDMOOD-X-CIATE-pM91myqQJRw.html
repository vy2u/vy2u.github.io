today's video is going to be a new a
will I buy it so I post my will I buy up
videos every single Wednesday and what I
do in my well I buy it is I talk about
makeup and if I will or will not
purchase the product and why are right
not kind of my thoughts on it a lot of
times I will go over new makeup launches
but I also go over like if things are
coming back in stock or just popular
items or if I'm just getting a lot of
comments from you guys on what you want
to see in my will I buy it that is what
I talk about in each video I started
these about it was probably in the
summer so I started doing the will I buy
it as a way to be able to talk about new
or popular makeup without feeling the
pressure of buying everything because I
cannot afford to buy everything and I do
not get PR packages so I thought it
would be a fun way to still be able to
talk about what I think about the
releases and if I'll buy them and kind
of how a regular person decides where to
put her money for her makeup because
there's always so many new products
coming out and launches and
collaborations at cetera that it can get
pretty overwhelming so it's a fun way to
give my opinions but then also you guys
are so good at giving your opinions as
well of what you think about them and
what you're gonna buy and you know why
you decided it's right for you why it's
not right for you so these are probably
my favorite videos to read the comments
through I do read and respond to all of
the comments but I think these are my
favorite videos to read your guys's
comments because I really like getting
your feedback as well so as always I do
have a lot to talk about so why don't I
go ahead didn't jump into this week's
will I buy it
okay so first up I was actually getting
a lot of questions about some new
launches from dose of colors so I
thought I would talk about it in this
video so they have a highlighter that's
releasing and then three new liquid
lipsticks so dose of colors I've
actually never purchased from them I did
talk about them in one of my past will i
buy videos I think it was on the ice
cream palette and I mentioned how I've
never purchased from them but I would
really like to and I still have not
purchased them so I want to throw that
out there right away that I have not
purchased from them so the highlight
they released is called gold is the new
black well is her photo in here so you
can see it it looks like a gold
highlighter it looks beautiful it says
from their website meet our new supreme
glow highlighter
Gold is the new black the perfect shade
of gold packed with color yet applies
weightlessly creating an illuminated
effect these are twenty eight dollars
each it looks really beautiful like it
looks like a bar of gold to me twenty
eight dollars is pretty steep for me to
buy a single highlighter because you can
buy a nastusya glow kit for $40 and give
four highlighters so that is that's a
little steep just looking on the website
right now under the description and
there is no information about the amount
of product in it because I was gonna try
to talk about that but there's I don't
know it looks like a good sized
highlighter from what I can see but
looking on the description it doesn't
say limit to per color says it's cruelty
free gluten free talc free it has the
ingredients but it does not have right
there on the website it doesn't have the
sides of it so I can't I don't know that
answer okay so like I said right it's
about $28 that's just pretty expensive
to me for a highlighter I really do like
highlights and I have a lot of
highlighters but $28 I think is going to
be too steep for me gold like true gold
highlights
I don't own a ton of them probably the
closest one I'd say is Prosecco pop from
Becca and Jaclyn hill I really do like
it I think gold can tend to look really
good on darker skin tones I still will
rock it with my lighter skin tone but
definitely like when I have a tan in
just my face is a little bit darker I
think the gold pops a lot more on me am
I feeling like I need to have a lot of
gold no I kind of issue I've a gold one
on today I have on butterscotch from
Anasazi Beverly Hills it's in the sweets
glow kit that one has you know kind of
like the butterscotch goldish type of
tones but honestly from what I have in
my highlight collection I'm fine and I
don't need to spend twenty eight dollars
on a single highlighter
that's just steep for me and like I said
I've never purchased from dose of color
so sometimes that's harder because you
kind of don't really know what to expect
from a brand I'm still planning on
making a purchase from them sometime
probably gonna happen in 2017 but I'm
gonna skip over the highlighter so the
other thing that they came out what they
came out was three
Oh liquid lipstick shades so the liquid
lipsticks from dose of colors honestly
probably excite me the most if I had to
like pick anything to buy from dose of
colors it's probably going to be there
Matt look at lipsticks because so many
people seem to love them I have heard so
many people talk about their look at
lipsticks and how great the formula is a
long-lasting comfortable gray colors etc
so I feel like stone from dose of colors
is like one of the most hyped about
liquid lipsticks that there is out there
so one of the new shades is in
cold-shoulder which is kind of
interesting so I'm wearing a cool tota
top right now that's kind of funny
so cold-shoulder it says it's a smoky
purple with cool gray undertone picture
to me it looks like a pretty deep purple
actually I'm probably not a color that I
would wear a lot looks like each of
their liquid lipsticks are $18 and this
is actually out of the three new ones
this is the only one I see on the
website that is sold out so even if I
wanted to get it right now it is sold
out it just says an estimated restock
date is to be announced so not sure when
that one is going to come back but for
me that one is not particularly what I
love in a liquid lipstick I probably
would pass over that color even if it
was in stock anyways just because I tend
not to go for the darker lips a ton and
much more of like nude brown pink type
of gal you know of course I'd like to
step out of my comfort zone every once
in a while but I don't think I would
purchase that one even if it was in
stock so another new one is called
rosebud again all of these are $18 this
one is in stock this says it's a soft
cotton candy pink with a lavender
undertone these look at lipsticks looks
like there's a limit of two per customer
in case you were wondering so this one I
actually really do like I like this
color I feel like I would like it on me
I feel like this would be the one that I
would probably gravitate towards the
most just because I think it would be
the favorite color on me $18 I do not
think is bad for a liquid lipstick
Anastasi azar 20 Kat Von D is 20 I think
Stila is like 20 for things like Kylie's
single liquid
six are like $17 so I mean it's right up
there in the high-end market so $80 to
me is not a bad price looking on the
dose of colors website you get free
shipping at $40 I have to say that I
don't think I would get this one either
don't feel like right now I need it in
my collection I have a lot of lipsticks
I need to do a lipstick declutter video
sometime soon because lipsticks are like
my weakness I talk about my a lot in the
wilayat videos that none I've shadow
Pella junkie I'm not a blush junkie but
I'm a lipstick junkie you guys I bought
a lipstick set in the Sephora vib sale
which was what like in November I have
not even opened it yet like that is how
many lipsticks that I have and I wear
lipstick almost every single day I
filmed every day - every other day so
I'm wearing lipsticks a lot I'm
constantly making Instagram tutorials
and I still have not even been able to
open that set like I have a problem and
I need to declutter so honestly that's
my biggest reason I think it's a
gorgeous color but it just to me it
doesn't make sense right now so we keep
putting lipsticks in my collection and
then I know I'm gonna like tomorrow I'll
probably go the drugstore and find a
lipstick and buy it it's a problem you
guys it's a problem but the last shade
that they released is called
Supernatural it's is a beige nude with a
honey undertone $18 limit - per person
this one it looks really pretty it kind
of reminds me a bit of exposed from
Kylie cosmetics which I own again that's
just looking at a swatch photo you know
obviously not trying it on my lips or
anything but from what I see it kind of
reminds me of the Kylie cosmetics and
exposed and truthfully kind of these
types of nudes aren't my favorite I just
recently tried nudie patooty from Wet n
Wild I do have a full video on the new
wet and wild liquid lipstick because of
course I bought some as I'm over here
complaining about my lipstick collection
I just bought three new ones from what
in wild but kind of like the straight
nudes like that I don't think are very
flattering on my skintone I'm much more
like I need nude pink or nude brown or
like not just nude or nude beige I don't
think they look the best on me so again
that's just now the color that I would
really prefer and then for the other
that I talked about just purchasing the
liquid lipsticks in general I'm gonna
pass over these right now from dose of
colors I'm gonna pass over the highlight
I don't need it it's a little bit pricey
in my opinion but I think I'm gonna
purchase from dose of colors at some
point this year I'll probably get
lipsticks I'll probably get a stone
because everybody talks about it but let
me know what you guys think about dose
of colors have you guys ordered from
them what do you think of them do you
have favorite products from them where
they have missed from you please let me
know in the comments down below because
I would love to read them and maybe get
a few guidance or suggestions on what I
should purchase when I decide to make a
purchase from dose of colors ok the next
one that was getting a lot of questions
asked is a new collab from colour-pop
and is in collaboration with Amanda
Steele so there is an eyeshadow palette
there's three lippies and then there is
three eyeshadows single eyeshadows and
to be really honest I'm not really sure
who I'm and Bastille is I feel I always
feel like really stupid when I say that
because I'm not trying to sound rude or
anything along those lines because I
mean it still doesn't know who I am
either I did look her up she's makeup by
Mandy so she has YouTube and Instagram
which is great and so I definitely want
to check her out now that I know her now
I just want to be honest about that just
being honest
so the collab wouldn't necessarily
encourage me to buy the products that
that makes sense but not all collabs do
I always go back to the style by her
Rouge palette with Tarte cosmetics is
one of my favorites and I really wasn't
that familiar with her ish before I
bought it either and I ended up loving
it so it really doesn't you know the
clouds don't always encourage me to buy
the products is all that I'm trying to
say so there's a I shadow palette and
it's $18 and it comes with four
eyeshadows so there is an a satin pale
pink a matte cool grey a matte deep in
teal and a matte deepened purple it
looks pretty and the packaging looks
pretty the colors aren't anything that
like knocked my socks off or that are
like I really really need to have that I
have a couple of like teal greens in my
collection as it is and I hardly hardly
reach for them oh and I always feel bad
because I think it's such a pretty color
and I really
how it looks on my eyes but I just
hardly reach for them I'm so much more
like just neutral and it's super boring
but that's it is what it is
so $18 for the eyeshadow palette I
probably wouldn't do it and then there's
the three lippy so there's jiffy which
is an ultra satin lip caps which is an
ultra matte lip and hack which is ultra
glossy lip so it's at in the matte and
glossy it looks to be more of a nude
color chaps is kind of like a darker
purple and then the gloss looks to be
like a pink gloss again I'm just gonna
skip over them you guys I don't know
does anyone else often feel very
overwhelmed by the amount of makeup
releases I mean I know that I'm a beauty
blogger and I get excited about new
releases and I like to talk about them
but at the same time if I like think
about how much money I'm spending on all
of these like it's kind of sickening so
I don't know sometimes I'm just like
another new release another new release
another new really is it's like I don't
need all of this makeup and I know I
feel like I should get like my beauty
vlogger card taken away from you when I
say that and I'm supposed to be like
encouraging people to buy but a lot of
you guys also say that you like the will
I bias because it makes you stop and
think a little bit more about what
you're purchasing and you know if you
really do need to be buying even more
makeup you put your money towards
something else type of thing and that
actually makes me really happy
it just it really does I don't come from
a lot I don't come from anything to be
honest with you guys
so I just feel like sometimes when I
look around at my makeup collection and
my brushes and just what I have already
and what I've worked really hard to be
able to buy for myself I'm like do I
really need to keep patting in with all
this stuff you know no probably not
do I still buy things yes but I feel
like I'm getting better at buying the
things that I really want to buy or you
know that I really want to review or
just that I really feel good about like
I'm not making a lot of purchases just
because of just to have it or just to
say that I have it you know what I mean
and that's kind of something for 2017
that I also really want to focus on
there's a lot of things that I would
like to have and places that I would
like to go and I won't get there if I
just continually keep spending money on
another nude lipstick and another
eyeshadow palette you know what I mean
so not to get like down and out about
anything like that or
trying to say like we shouldn't be
spending our money on makeup or I'm not
gonna spend money on makeup the rest
year because I was totally not what I'm
saying I'm just saying that I really do
try to pay better attention I would love
to be able to buy some more lighting and
I'd love to be able to grade my camera
and you know things like that and I'm
not gonna be able to obtain those goals
if I just keep spending money on makeup
you know so that's all I want to say
there maybe some of you can relate to
that but the last items and there are
single eyeshadows and these are all five
dollars so there's ignition it looks to
be like a pretty purple hydroplane which
looks to be like another type of teal
green and then steel which looks like a
light pink you know of course like I say
I don't really wear like the crazy
colors a lot but my eyes immediately go
to hydroplate it was just kind of like
the teal was some sparkle in it cuz I
don't know why I guess that's like where
my eyes go they're just like I really
like that color but then I'm like no you
don't worried enough like what are you
thinking oh but I mean again they look
really pretty but in color pop is super
affordable I mean five dollars for a
single eyeshadow you really can't beat
that really good prices
I like color pop a lot they're a brand I
purchased from a lot I'm wearing color
pop on my lips right now I do like color
pop but just you know in the scheme of
everything that I've been talking about
and you know just that the the products
don't necessarily scream out to me I say
it a lot in my will i buy it videos as
well that I don't need to convince
myself to purchase makeup there's so
many products out there and so many new
releases coming out there that a product
will scream at me it will say Samantha I
need you to buy this and those are the
products that I need to consider buying
if there's products that are coming out
that I'm not hearing anything from them
I don't need to convince myself to buy
them because there's gonna be all these
over here shouting at me so hopefully
hopefully that makes sense but I'm gonna
pass over at the Amanda Steele and
colour-pop cosmetics collab so Tarte
cosmetics released a new rainforest of
the sea eyeshadow palette it says it is
volume 2 so I actually really wanted to
get the first reinforce of the C palette
from car I don't know why it was
something that like I was kind of more
calling my name and I really considered
getting it I almost purchased it but I
actually went into Sephora and was able
to swatch it and I didn't really love
the swatches they just seemed a little
too like light and
Maree for me like they just didn't pack
enough punch for me so I decided to skip
over the original rainforest of the sea
i shadow pellet from tarte so now they
are back in with a second one I'll leave
the photo down here again it looks
really pretty I like the packaging of it
I like that it's kind of like the the
circle and you know the pan sizes look
to be really decent sizes from the
website it says crease free eye shadow
palette with the best selling creamy
powder formula and eight new cool tone
shades so you have a white shimmer and
off-white a yellow gold a caramel
chestnut dark brown shimmering slate and
steel blue it is $36 it does say that
it's limited edition so I feel like I
talked about it in every will I buy
video I talk about limited edition but I
still just on last week's video someone
said why is it a red flag of something
as limited edition so just real quick
why I don't like to purchase a ton of
limited edition are limited quantity is
because then it's harder to talk about
in tutorials and use the products
because a lot of people were not able to
get them or missed out on them are now
they're not available so it's harder to
use you know you want to be using the
products that are still for sale or
people still you know can get am I ever
going to not purchase anything that's
limited edition or limited quantity no
that's not possible I definitely still
will but it's something that I try to
keep in the back of my mind is make sure
I'm not putting more into my makeup
collection that's harder to use on
camera so that's why I try to stay away
from limited edition so Limited Edition
isn't great but honestly I'm probably
gonna pass over this one too because I
didn't love how the first pallets watch
for me and I don't know I mean it says
it's the best selling eyeshadow formula
but at the same time I really don't see
a lot of people talk about this
eyeshadow palette people talk about like
the tartlet and bloom way more than the
rainforest of the sea eyeshadow palette
so kind of when you see people not
talking about products as much to me
that means they're probably not loving
on it as much so that's kind of where my
mind goes so I don't know maybe people
have the same experiences I did I just
didn't love the swatches on the first
one so that's kind of what's taking me
away from the segment one i don't
purchase eyeshadow palettes a ton or i
try not to
least because I have a lot of eyeshadow
palettes I have a lot of single
eyeshadows and sort of things so I don't
feel like I need more at this time
sometimes I can get over a while but
don't I'm doing my makeup I'm like how
did I get this many I shadow palettes
like what am i doing but because of
those reasons I'm gonna go ahead and
skip over the Tarte rainforest of the
sea volume 2 palette but let me know did
you guys get the first one are you
planning on getting the second one what
did you think about the first one I
would love to know your opinions on that
towards one of my favorite brands I
purchased from them very frequently but
the eyeshadows just seemed like a Miss
for me and then the last fact that I
want to talk about is the one that I've
been getting asked the most questions on
the questions actually started coming in
a while ago and I've been trying to wait
to talk about this one until we had a
little bit more information on what
exactly was all going down I don't have
a ton of information yet so I might have
to revisit this one in the future as
well but I'm gonna talk about it people
keep asking about it and it is the trend
mood by CSA collapse so trend mood is a
super popular Instagram page that
announces new makeup releases and prices
and swatches and just kind of keeps the
makeup community up and up with
everything if I have a question on
really any sort of makeup release or I
want to see a swatch or wanna know a
price or a release date I go to trend
moods Instagram and check it out a lot
of times when I'm thinking of what to do
for a while I buy it if I'm trying to
figure out okay like what's new what's
coming up I will go to the tread moon
Instagram page to get some inspiration
tastic page so I was excited to see that
there was going to be a collaboration
with Fiat a so I'm reading from bustled
it says that they're collaborating on an
eyeshadow palette which is completely
crowd-sourced
trend mood which is the ultimate makeup
news and swatch source on instagram
teamed up with the london-based brand to
dive into the CIA archives and resurrect
colors that were never put into
production it's a new take on recycled
beauty and reminds us that everything
deserves a second chance including a
rejected eyeshadow hue trend moon has
been asking fans and followers further
input on every detail and aspect of the
palette from the packaging shape to the
shades themselves so what it is is going
to be an eyeshadow palette there's going
to be ten shades inside I will leave a
photo in here because we do have what
the palette is going to look like the
Sun just went
Oh see what the lighting looks like
maybe it's coming back so we have been
able to see what the shades look like
and right now what tread moon is doing
on her Instagram is asking people to
come up with names for it from what I'm
seeing it looks like there's like three
names that she picks and then people
vote on them so that they're naming them
as they go along at the time of filming
this video the first three shades have
been named and then every like couple of
days it seems she's posting a new photo
new swatch and saying what should we
name this one like the article said that
she's asked for input on what the
packaging should look like the shape of
it and I just think that's really cool I
think it's a really unique way to do a
collab
usually when a collab is going to come
out it's done and you know finalized and
then we just hear about it in two days
later it releases so I thought this was
a really cool collaborative effort and I
just think that's super unique I'm I'm
really down with that idea I think it's
super cool as of right now I could not
find a release date and I could not find
a price so those are two really big
things that I do not have the
information yet if I have it by the time
this video goes up which is really soon
so probably not but I'll leave that in
the description box below or if you guys
have heard maybe an inkling of when
it'll come out or what the price will be
please do leave it in the comments down
below I was not able to find that on
Instagram and bustle or a lure or even
the tried movie website right now all
I'm seeing is you know naming up the
shades so I'm assuming that will come
down the line but especially the price
is a really big piece that I would need
to know but I'm not gonna lie I really
like how the swatches looked so I think
the outer packaging was really cute and
pretty but the inside like the so right
now it's called rose gold that looks
like to be the last one that was named
that shade of rose gold it looks
gorgeous but even sneak pink which is
like um it almost kind of reminds me of
the rosebud lipstick from dose of colors
that looks gorgeous but there's like a
beautiful orange and then some red tones
and there's also some blue in there like
I really like this palette and I think
it just looks really cool and really fun
like it's not an all neutral palette
it's not an all colorful palette like
there's kind of a mixture of everything
in here I like the way that trend mood
is going about it I think that is really
fun of course I can't say yet for sure
because I don't have the price yet so I
don't know what it would be hopefully it
would be something on the more
affordable line but as of right now I'm
gonna say that yes I will probably
purchase this palette and I know that
stuff I need is I'm like I don't know
what are shadow palettes but when things
really call out to me they really do
call out to me and I just think this one
is super cool I think it would be really
fun also to support trend win like I
said I've been following her for a very
long time and it's just really cool and
I can imagine how much effort must go
into her Instagram page that's a lot to
keep up on that's a lot to post and get
ready and you know hopefully she has
helpers and and you know she always says
out there you know thank you to this
page for telling me about this deal and
thank you to this person for this
information which i think is so awesome
like she gives credit where credit is
due and I I appreciate that fact a lot
so without knowing the price which is
hard to say for sure but I definitely am
keeping my eye on that treadmill and
ciate collab because I'm really feeling
what is inside that palette and I'm just
super loving on how she is doing it how
the collaboration is going down I think
that's really cool I think that's really
unique I would love to see more of that
in the beauty community I think it's
awesome so definitely keeping my eye on
that palette I can keep you guys updated
with news as I hear it of course I can
put it in another will I buy a video
once we have the final pieces of the
puzzle I'll put together if you guys
would want to see my final thoughts on
it I just did that recently what's the
cap on being two-faced collab and my
opinions actually changed from my first
of all I buy it to the second while I
buy it that I did after the collection
was actually here and released and we
had all the information so if you'd want
to see a follow up to this one please do
let me know but a lot of you guys been
asking me about this one from a while
back so I I did want to talk about it
