today's video is going to be a new will
i buy it i post my bolivian videos every
single Wednesday talking about some new
makeup releases letting you know a
little bit about them and then chatting
over if I'm going to pick them up or
pass over them so why don't we go ahead
and get started with this week's
affiliate video okay so first up I got
some tags on this new release from a
Smashbox cosmetics they're coming out
with new photo finish primer waters and
it is in collaboration with the Beauty
influencer Nicole Concilio so they have
the photo finish primer water juices
face primer there are $32 each they are
a limited edition
there is a centering a citrus which is
like balancing blood orange and
grounding grapefruit there's a serene
greens a cooling cucumber and mellow
melon and so chill coconut a relaxing
blend of coconut and vanilla so I feel
like Smashbox is pretty well known for
their primer water I have it myself a
lot of people talk about it a lot of
people use it I see a pop up in a lot of
videos so I have purchased it myself I
do quite like it it's nothing like Holy
Grail status for me or anything like
that but I like it just fine so I mean I
was intrigued when I saw that they were
coming out with these new guys but
nothing that like gave me an absolute
pull like I must absolutely own this I
also have a ton of setting sprays I
actually need to really go through them
and pick some out to declutter because I
just have too many right now I have the
Smashbox primer water I can see it
through my little clear drawer and it is
well over half full so I don't feel like
I would really need to get another
primer water from Smashbox I know these
guys are a little bit different because
they have the different scents and
they're supposed to do different things
but again it's just not something that I
need in my collection $32.00 is
definitely expensive before primer water
I believe the the primer water that I
have I want to say it was the alter 21
days of beauty was it one of these past
times that it was on sale for like half
off or maybe it was a hot Buy and that's
when I bought it because still I was
like $32 it's just expensive for a
primer water so I got it on sale I will
be doing an alter 21-day is a beauty
video for you guys as well so don't
worry I know I've been giving some
question said I love those videos
they're some of my favorite to make I'll
definitely be doing that alte 21 days of
beauty video because it is coming up
here but yeah I don't know these didn't
really do anything for me I really just
the biggest thing is I feel like I don't
need it
and then it is in collaboration with
Nicole can see leo I'm not sure I fully
understand the collab between the two
but I used to watch in a clothes video
quite a bit and then I just kind of
tapered off I don't really watch them as
much anymore the collab doesn't
necessarily pull at me but then also I'm
not really sure I quite I don't know
it's just kind of like a funny
collaboration with primary waters I'm
sure there's a reason behind it I'm sure
some of you guys know the reason behind
that it's probably like Nicole's
favorite thing from Smashbox or
something like that so it would make
sense but for me I don't know that right
off the bat but again not something I
need so I'm gonna go ahead and pass over
it but are you so excited you love the
primer water you need to have like all
three scents what's your favorite scent
that you want to get or are you like me
and you're gonna pass over them let us
know in the comments feel like I should
be able to get through this week's Villa
by it pretty quickly
I know I commented on Angelica's video
when she does her new makeup releases
going on the wish list or not I
commented on her video cuz she even said
it in hers that she thought it was kind
of like a slower week and I was like yes
I feel that too especially compared to
just like the past couple weeks here
there's been so much especially like a
lot of palettes which a lot of people
get excited over palettes when I feel
like the will i buy it videos have been
like jam-packed as of lately and of
course there's like drama going on but I
felt like this week was like kind of
calm compared to other weeks which I do
not mind but I have it two foundations
here that I want to talk about I really
enjoy foundations I love finding new
foundations I just like I'm still on
this foundation kick I don't even know
when it started but I'm still like
completely on it okay so Sunday Riley is
coming out with a foundation which I
thought was very interesting Sunday
Riley is known for their skincare so now
they have foundation so this is called
the influencer it says clean long wear
foundation a skin focused foundation
makes sense that perfects your skin with
long wear lightweight satin matte finish
buildable medium-full coverage conceals
redness large pores dark spots without
settling into any lines that controls
oil but never dehydrates
skin of her fresh-looking shine free
healthy-looking skin for all skin types
in twenty-eighth for $42 sometimes I say
it I feel like I stayed almost every
week some of the claims on makeup
products is like so expensive it's just
crazy to me it's just crazy to me so
that's a lot of claims for a foundation
so 42 dollars for it says 1.08 ounces
most foundations are around one ounce so
that's actually not bad I guess I may be
expected someday Riley to be like really
expensive because their skincare is
really expensive so 42 dollars for your
standard ounce no terrible says it will
be available at March 30th online at
Sephora I'm reading from trend woods
Instagram so it'll be linked to my
description box as always so I'm
interested in this one cuz it says it's
a skin focused foundation it was Sunday
Riley being so skincare focused I'm just
I'm into this right now I've been doing
a lot of like looks like today like very
minimal eye shadow just some mascara but
I'm trying to focus on my skin I get a
really nice foundation on that leaves my
skin just like looking good but then
like this I like having like the
highlight kind of like the dewy skin at
the same time I feel like you've been
seeing this look in some videos as of
recently and that's just kind of my
go-to I've been super busy right now
like my schedule is very very busy and
we're getting ready to go on a vacation
so it's just been kind of crazy with
some work commitments that I have I'm
like outside of YouTube like my author
life I have a lot of commitments there
so I can't sit down a lot and like do
something like full-on with my makeup
but I'm still trying to film every day
and pre film so like that's why you're
seeing a lot of these looks and videos
recently so I'm I'm interested in this
especially because of the $42 I really
thought that it would be more it says
it's medium to full coverage and that's
kind of like my sweet spot when it comes
to foundation it says a satin matte
finish I like that it says satin matte
because I'm not like matte matte type of
girl like I was just saying I like to do
the highlight I like to look dewy so I
don't know then it says it's lightweight
and long wear but then says only medium
full coverage so this black I don't know
sometimes when there's so many claims it
feels like this claim doesn't
necessarily match up with this claim I
don't know but I'm interested i this one
this one am I
you guys like to see a review on this
guy are you guys curious about it it's
not coming out till the 30th so I have
some time to decide but I'm pretty
interested in this one I'm not gonna lie
so let me know what you think about that
foundation but there's also another one
that has my intrigued right now and I'm
getting ready to place my support order
again I've been so busy the freaking
backtalk palette is out and I still
haven't ordered it but I'm going to it's
in my card at Sephora but there's a few
other things I want to get but like I
said I've just been so busy I get to
speak at a writers conference in May if
you guys don't know I'm a published
author I got asked to speak at the
national Oklahoma Writers Conference in
May and I'm also a judge in their
writing contest and I've been working I
have over 50 entries to read and
critique and all of that and that's like
basically what is what my days are I
have a manager pulled up that I'm
reading and then I'm trying to write my
speeches for that I've seen of two
different speeches during the conference
and then my sixth book is in
proofreading and also in cover design so
I've been working on that so like oh my
gosh I just have a lot going on at the
moment I will be placing that order soon
I want that back talk polite but then
this was one that I was looking at this
at the Safari website because it is
already available so this is from
coverfx and so they have a foundation
it's called the powerplay it says high
performance long wearing modern matte
foundation as it is designed for women
on the go and delivers color true
all-day wear with powerful shine control
and environmental protection and it's 44
dollars each I think that I noticed when
I was looking at this on the sephora
website is they have different
undertones they have pink undertones
which i thought was pretty cool because
I think I'm mostly a pink undertone and
I think they have did they say 40
different shades and different
undertones Shawna was 44 dollars and you
also get just over an ounce I think it
was like 1.1 ounces of product so pretty
similar to the sundae Riley this one is
out like I was saying I was looking out
on this for a website and I'm trying to
decide between the two because I don't
think that I would need both right now
neither price range is necessarily
terrible to me though I for sure thought
Sunday Riley was going to be more in the
50
range I really did cover effects I think
maybe I would have expected in the $40
range but Sunday Riley I'm almost
leaning towards Sunday Riley just
because of you know like focusing on the
skin in all of that and then the cover
FX one it sounds more like it's gonna be
a mattifying foundation and more full
coverage it doesn't say full coverage on
here but just reading like all day we're
open oh it does it says color true all
day we're weightless full coverage where
the other word Sunday Riley was medium
to full coverage so I'm kind of leaning
towards a Sunday Riley but what do you
think what do you guys think are you
interested in either foundation did
either one catch your attention again
the only thing is that I want to place
my Sephora order like today if I could
find time and I want to place my Sephora
order soon and coverfx is out now
whereas the other other Riley is not
total xxx so it's like I mean I'm sure
I'm gonna place another four order at
some point in the future but I was just
kind of be nice to have it now but kind
of like talking over it and thinking
about it I think I'm gonna go in the
sunday Riley route I'm curious I'm
interested they got my attention coverfx
still has my attention a little bit but
I really think that I would just have to
decide between the two and I think
Sunday Riley has just like a little like
the littlest bit of a boost over coverfx
but I'd love to know your guys's sauce
what do you think about these two
foundations are you interested in either
and if you are which one are you
thinking about getting but that's kind
of what I think about the news Sunday
Riley foundation and also the cover FX
foundation and then I just I have a to
skin care products it to finish off with
and I wanted to include these together
because to me they were like kind of
similar to one another and they're from
two of my favorite skin care brands so
first if I have this a new release from
Lula Hendrickson it's the C rush
brightening gel creme it says it's a
vitamin C packed gel moisturizer that
delivers a burst of 24-hour hydration
targets fine lines and wrinkles and
instantly brightens and protects skin
from environmental stresses such as dirt
and pollution there's again there's a
lot of different claims on this one one
that was interesting to me was it says
has a color corrector
perfect for use under makeup you know
played before makeup as a primer as well
it also contains hyaluronic acid which I
absolutely love and collagen which can
help come
the skin let's see here it's $44 and
it's going to be available March 15th on
their website March 27th online at
Sephora and April 6 in the stores so $44
per moisturizer that's pricey to me but
Lula Hendrickson just has some balm
skincare started with their skincare by
giving I think it's still on the floor
website so I was just looking at it the
other day like I know the 250 point
section you can get like a little sample
packs and they have different
moisturizers in there the truth serum
which I absolutely love and that's kind
of how I started I went on and purchased
a three-set pack of different masks
around the holiday time I think it was
fell in love with one of them already
repurchased it I ended up getting a PR
package eventually from from the brand
which I thought was super freaking
exciting fell in love with the products
that they had it there I'm just really
impressed with a lot of their line and I
feel like it is worth it for their
skincare so I am real real curious about
this one especially because it just has
so many things in there that I think are
important for my skincare the vitamin C
the hyaluronic acid it just sounds like
a really nice moisturizer and I'm very
very much interested in this one so $44
I know a little pricey I think the vib
sale is coming up in April so that might
be something for me to add to my list
for then but I'm very curious about that
one and then I was saying teasers of a
new release from drunk elephant Oh drunk
elephant drunk elephant man they do have
some really awesome products in there
and some projects that I will be
repurchasing I never bent the bullet on
Jonathan because it is so expensive is
like luxury skincare and I just couldn't
do it and I don't know how in the world
I managed to attract their attention but
I ended up getting a PR package from
them and that was like thank you and at
the same time I was like oh goodness am
I gonna follow up with everything
I haven't fall in love with everything
I've been reviewing a lot of the
products in my make up monthly each
month and there's been across-the-board
favorites fails and products that I
thought were just okay and I would only
definitely repurchase the ones that I
like I'm absolutely in love with because
of the high
price tag but there have been some
really really nice products in there so
they're coming out with the seat angle
multivitamin eye cream and again I
started seeing teasers for it it didn't
have like a price or anything on it but
I was like mm okay what is that I'm
interested I am a big believer in eye
creams eye gels everything I do it
morning and evening it's a skincare step
that I don't miss and that I haven't
missed for a very very long time or
though I always want me to take care of
the skin underneath my eyes and it's
something that I've always I've always
had it in here I've always listened to
you grams but this new one from a drunk
elephant the sea tango multivitamin eye
cream it features a brightening
combination of eight peptides five forms
of vitamin C cucumber extract for firmer
stronger looking skin around your eyes
and I was like yes I'm interested and
then I saw that it was $64 for an eye
cream and I was like probably not that's
just really expensive for an eye cream
and I will said that I have been trying
the eye cream that drunk elephant has
out right now I've been kind of
incorporating that one in there so I can
review it and to me it's not really
anything super special if anything I
think I'm gonna end up putting it in the
fine category in my makeup monthly but
icons are kind of a challenging thing
but once you do find ones that you think
really do work are you really enjoy I
feel like you can tell the difference
between the eye creams that you think
are just like soso and the ones that you
would actually go out and repurchase and
for me for this one it's just been kind
of like so so I don't think it's
absolutely horrible but it wasn't
anything that I was like I should really
have this again so for this one even
though again it has some of the
ingredients there that I think sound
great and I I like a lot of their skin
care I think $64 is gonna be too
expensive for me and then just base I
mean I I understand that's a different
eye cream I'm talking about but based on
that theory I'm like I could probably
say no to this one so I think I'm gonna
go ahead and pass over this guy from
drunk elephant especially because I -
that other skincare product from mullah
hendrickson that one's on moisturizer
versus an eye cream so again we're
talking more two different skin care
products here but I think I'm gonna
swing that way for there moisturize
there I have tried other moisturizers
from Allah Hendrickson in the past I
just mentioned it might have been last
month's makeup monthly or the one I
think it was the
before January's I've featured their
moisturizer in there that I've been
using currently and I really do enjoy
that one so I think I would lean that
way and save my $64 on the drunk
elephant but what do you guys think
about both of these skincare products is
either one interest to you neither one
interest you have you tried either of
these skincare brands and what do you
think but after that one from drunk
elephant that's going to do it for this
week's Olivia video I guess so that is
everything for this week's abide by a
video I really hope you enjoyed this
video or found it helpful or
entertaining in some way and as always
