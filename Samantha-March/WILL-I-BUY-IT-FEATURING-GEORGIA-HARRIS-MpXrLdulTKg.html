today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it and I have a special yeah it's
only three today this is a Georgia
Harris she has driven all the way to
Iowa to film with me and all the way
from Alaska did I say all the way from I
over to Iowa oh well you guys know I
mean I'm an Iowa so Georgia drove drown
drove down so we could film some videos
together we have a get ready with me
featuring these beautiful makeup looks
over on her channel it will be linked
down below if you're not yet subscribed
to Georgia you must go do it why don't
you just must go do it
but wonder had the idea for us to do it
will I buy it together on my channel I
thought it was a great idea yes we have
very different like makeup stylist oh
we're princes yeah everything so I
thought it would be cool is to give both
of ours
yeah you know we'll have a video so
that's ever been doing today plus I look
you you haven't wanted to do these
videos but I was like I need to do it
with someone I just like figure out the
way there you go I hope that you do them
I would love to see you do them oh yeah
I get whenever and anybody does these
have sub videos they're my favorites to
watch I just love seeing what people are
into by the way and we're at my hotel
room oh yeah if you want to figure out
why we're in the hotel you know me here
go watch they get ready with me yeah but
also this is my dog Wesley he might hop
up on the bed so if you if that's sweet
that's will be hopping on the bed if he
hops on the bed they are filming this on
March 15 so yeah if anything has come
out recently and you're like why didn't
we talk about it that's why that's why
you know feeling pretty early in advance
yeah but you wanna get started yes
usually when I do my will I bite videos
I just kind of like pick out a few of
the top products that I feel like I've
been tagged on and I talk about when
they're releasing and prices and all of
that but I'm just gonna have all that
information down below I always link
everything in my videos it'll all be
down there but we have a lot that we
want to talk about I'm going to talk
about more than just a few things since
when is this what what does this ever
happen for me never I've never filmed in
person collab with anybody so this is
really exciting for me we're gonna talk
about color pop cuz I feel like I
haven't talked about color pop in a few
weeks
my channel and that's very strange for
me but they just release they really
what don't they really seriously like
something I'm like I can't talk about
them every single week like I get tired
but they're coming out the butterfly
collection isn't is that what it's
called I thought it was called the like
the spring my mood says the butterfly
collection spring 2018 okay why I'm
wrong you're right whatever that means
what do you think about it okay so I
know I mentioned you this to you earlier
I feel like the packaging is way more
interesting than the original products
yeah I feel like all the colors are
stuff that I've seen color pop do before
mm-hmm and that's only because like
color bubbles come up with so much stuff
yeah
but they do have those new the lux
lipsticks and then there's more colors
and those yeah so that's a little you
know something new like their color pop
the Libby Stix
mm-hmm I've seen those colors yeah the
super shock shadows yeah is there
anything you get no no well and it's
interesting was like the lippie stix
I feel like all of those colors are out
I don't would you release so much I'm
like how are things different they're
just like a hair hair of a shade yeah
yeah but I don't like the super shock
shadows no it's not for me
I had one once and I I feel like when I
used it it didn't look very pigmented
mm-hmm and I don't mind using my fingers
for stuff but I did there's something
about it like I also heard that because
you have to screw the lid on something
and they dry out so fast they're kind of
made me like I can I want to go yeah
yeah the one thing I did think was kind
of cool is they're coming up with face
duos and we don't have the photo here
but I thought the face do it was a cool
yeah and I think I think the face duos
have the exact same packaging it's like
that with the butterflies on them so
when you buy the face - what you're
actually getting the nice packaging
versus like getting a lipstick and then
having yeah it's been true very true I
wanted to try their face to us for a
while when they had like bronzers and
highlights mm-hmm but I never did I
don't know why I haven't really tried
many other powder products other than
the powder eyeshadows and I like those I
like I like someone - I did try some and
I was like but most of the ones I've
tried are really good nice yeah that's
good so are you getting anything from
I'm probably not yet I'm probably not
gonna get anything actually on a no by 4
March so
nothing buying anything unless it's like
in April yeah I get that I don't feel
like I've ever like said I'm going on a
no-buy but I've definitely gone through
bursts of times where I haven't bought
anything but I feel like if I like say
I'm on a no by then I want to buy
everything yeah I just don't say I just
don't admit it out loud what shall we
talk about nice John talked about the
melt yes this is two times now sometimes
we get weird
this is getting weird okay so we have a
new all right so melt cosmetics is
coming out as a couple of baby girl yes
oh why I don't know oh I can't be right
they're coming out with the baby girl
melt stack so there's five shades yes
yeah it looks like there's three mats
and then two like metallics or shimmers
yeah and it was interesting I don't
personally have anything from Ella I
have one because my friend Emily sent me
a single and I liked it so I like they
do have a good formula in my opinion
yeah don't like the hockey puck
packaging mm-hmm
not a big fan of that mm-hmm I don't
know if like did you see the original
launch like the teaser photo when it
first came in yeah yeah so if anyone's
like what you watch trend move where you
follow melt on their Instagram they
showed this teaser photo of like Collins
there did here we're doing it we're
doing a new stack and it was like a
color like burst and it was like pinks
and oranges and there was like a green
and yellow wanted a little bit of purple
but I like and I was like oh this looks
exciting it's gonna be vibrant and
there's gonna be multiple colors and
then we get monochromatic Orange that a
coral that is pretty surprising yeah
yeah the teaser photo made me think it
was gonna be more like a variation of
color but I wasn't expecting something
so monochromatic um I probably not gonna
buy this one no no I really do like the
she's and party mellstock okay and the
summer it's like dark mommy oh yeah yeah
purpley your tones I think that one's
interesting um but I don't really like
the new one I feel like I have all those
shades yeah I'm new here
dude when you're looking at it do you
like it reminder like what's that
palette by morphe it's like the de 502
yes that's about that first my first
thought yeah yeah and I have the 302 so
yeah and I know the melt stacks are
expensive so I think that's why I've
never bought them I think they're so
expensive partly because of the
packaging yeah and then I mean the
formula is good so it's not like good
you're paying for packaging mm-hmm but
the packaging is factored into the price
of the makeup yeah yeah film thank you a
lot
yeah right on but no I'm not interested
in either I just I know I have those
shades and that's pricey so that's not
for me yeah for me uh let's see here
do you want to talk about this Kat Von D
why don't you see what happened cuz you
saw it too right on there like what does
it say on the thing exactly the dopest
lipstick holder only five are available
only five are available we were looking
at that earlier and I was like I don't
know what that make like why is there
only five I don't understand if it was
like I don't get it
and the thing is if you wanted that
lipstick holder you had to buy the
entire collection all of the lipsticks
it is a total of six hundred and ninety
five dollars and we're a lipstick holder
with all the lipsticks but that's I mean
I mean yes that's a lot of lipsticks and
you have a cool little bit set that's
$700 on lipstick that's a lot and III
think it just it seems kind of weird to
me like I don't know if their childlike
like get people like when asking for it
like me please make more or something
but like I don't understand why they
just didn't release the holder because I
feel like a lot of people abide it yeah
cuz I'm great I think they went to hmm
especially if you have a big study kiss
lipstick collection people would want it
even though I'm gonna have other
lipsticks I'm sure other lipsticks would
fit in there yeah I'm not sure I
understand but the only five available
no yeah that's a very odd number to be
500 maybe like yes yes but then also
like 500 but not making it so you had to
buy an entire lipstick yeah cuz what if
you're someone who already owns a bunch
of a bunch of the lipsticks then what do
you do just buy more yeah I mean
just I don't know it was kind of weird
yeah I left the holder idea though I do
table I just wish they would salt
separately yeah
ah you wanna talk about Turk last week
I've been getting asked a lot of
questions on the new tart eyeshadow
palette the be a mermaid and make waves
and I've been putting it off for a while
but I keep getting asked what I think
about it and what I will say is I was
taking my high-end eyeshadow palette
de-clutter which I just supposed to
recently I'll be linked to my
description box if you wanna watch it is
that there was two tower eyes shadow
pellets in there and when I opened them
up they were really similar to one
another Oh buddy oh yeah and then when I
saw this one I was like those are
basically like the two are just too
cluttered out of my collection it looks
just the same you're not Satan like
Taarabt eyeshadow palettes are kind of
like if you have one yet mom yeah
disgustin sketcher yeah I do think it
was interesting about how they did put
those blue and the green colors in there
mm-hmm
they didn't like it would have been
cooler if they did like a blue green and
purple palette yeah I feel like a lot of
people wouldn't like yes especially
because I feel like that's something
it's very laughing mm-hmm yeah there is
this there could have been more colors
in there for a mermaid yeah palette that
could have been more colorful I'm not
really buying anything from tar right
now just because of the shaped a
foundation and then just some other
things that like tart really hasn't been
pleasing me one thing I do really like
and like I wasn't mad at heart I do like
the magnetic palette we have mm-hmm they
actually make really good magnetic
pallets they're sturdy like sturdier
than like as epal or something and they
have a nice they have a nice big mirror
and that there's a nice magnetic closure
on them and then this one's like blue
green purple sequins like it's yeah it's
that I think that's like the best they
go to the collection yeah in my opinion
yeah what about the brushes you just
want me to like be upset about these
damn fish brushes so if anyone knows me
from my channel I've talked about all
these crazy makeup brushes to come out
before and I basically have said how
they aren't mermaid brushes if there
isn't like the the top like you need the
mermaid if you just have the tail it's
just a fish brush that's true if this
but everyone likes these so much and
people keep coming out with them and
they literally they look like every
single you know all those eBay and like
that Aliexpress the fish yep and you
were that like that fat fish brush that
came out last year yeah definitely have
that you do it got sent to me I don't
think I've ever used it uh are you gonna
buy anything from this collection no I'm
also not buying anything from tart just
the shape tape foundations was was rough
but even before that they were doing
things I wasn't agreeing with and the
last time I did my products I regret
buying video I think it was there was
like two or three tart items that I
mentioned in there I returned a bunch of
things clay bleh - didn't please me yeah
the princess Park Avenue princess pout
like that wasn't doing it just they just
seemed to be on a downhill slide for a
while for me and then shaped a
foundation happened and I was like I
should have been listening to my gut
earlier yeah I just kept being like no
no no reading a comment wants a forum
about people basically talking about how
you know we're tired of seeing like
mermaids and unicorns and stuff but then
someone was also saying how like members
of the the quasi YouTube community like
the feel like um like the you know like
the Japanese or Nazi vloggers they're
all like super excited oh okay okay so
they're like um I've heard a lot of them
say that not a lot of stuff like this
gets released in like mainstream
collections okay so they're like please
keep releasing it even though like
general makeup lovers are like we're
tired yes yes I think that's why I mean
if any different communities reacting
from Lena stuff yes that's for sure you
haven't uh that's gonna be you know it's
gonna be no for me on that collection as
well it's a no for me dog
Oh what about I got I got so many things
on the Sun the Urban Decay sin afterglow
palette
yes highlighter and blush palette what
are highlighters and what are the
blushes I'm not a hundred percent I
think this is probably geared more
towards people who we have a darker skin
tone than us because I'm looking at this
right now I'm only thinking like these
would work up for blushes for me mm-hmm
um I don't personally have any v4 this
I've tried
Urban Decay blushes before and they're
highlighters I think they're fine so
this is probably I don't foresee this
being a bad release mm-hmm
for me personally I don't have any
interest in buying it yeah I I got
tagged a lot and once I saw it was that
an urban decay palette I did get pretty
excited because I felt hardcore in love
with the urban decay it's in highlight
when I got it and I was probably like a
really annoying you took like in every
video I was like what have you tried
there ever tanzanite I loved it but then
I went and purchased the palette one of
their afterglow palettes they came out
with a new one and I just didn't love it
I barely reached for it I like the
Kristen LeAnn highlight palette that
came out in that collection yeah that
one I thought was a lot better than that
palette and I just got the backtalk
palette so I don't think that I'd need
it I like the packaging I think for me
personally I've also kind of gotten away
from buying palettes of highlighters
because I feel like I only ever
gravitate to a couple colors in the
palette mm-hmm and I'd rather just buy
like a single yeah cuz I get more use
out of it yep that makes sense so yeah
that's gonna be a no for me oh it says
did we say yes to anything
oh I haven't yet I but you're on a novi
so you have well yeah but this is all
stuff that like I could get later but
let me even then I'm like no buy it
really affected much here I feel like
we're gonna talk about something next
that you've definitely gonna buy the
terra cotta bronzer from Guerlain oh
wait she showed it to me earlier my
first thought was what is that I was
like what is it it's a bronzer from
Guerlain I do think it would be pretty
if it wasn't a bronzer and if it was
like an actual compass yes that would be
the best yeah sure yeah shaped like
homers I didn't feel this was an over
spray yeah and I remember I was saying
to you before how I don't mind using
products if there's like something
stamped in the powder but when there's
like different colors and my different
layers and it's like it's just gonna
look gross after a while yeah yeah I
agree there's no price on it but I bet
it's gonna be really praised oh yeah
it's gonna be like 90 bucks and yeah
yeah and your firstborn
I'm gonna know for that as well you're
gonna have to give up Aries if you want
that yeah yes for sure
talk about Pat McGrath
so Pat McGrath has new eyeshadow
palettes mm-hm so these are smaller and
include six shades each it shows that I
liked it on your phone it's been so
interesting because we hung out all the
night before and then we've been
together all day yeah I got here at like
8:30 probably because we have yes but
it's just been so interest this is the
first time I'm meeting a youtuber so it
was just really funny especially at
dinner like we were having conversations
about YouTube life and I don't really
get that a lot like my husband will
listen to me my best friend will like
listen to me but it's just been a really
cool experience it's been so awesome and
then especially like we were both
sitting out in the other room like
watching YouTube videos beyond it was
awesome but so we got these new
eyeshadow palettes so there's three
pallets yes what do you think about
these
I am only really interested in the
purple one the other two now I'm kind of
like the other one the other ones like a
cool tone one the other ones like a warm
tone one I feel like I have enough like
Mormon cool tone shadows in my
collection and I don't really feel the
need to get that one but I do love Pat
McGrath Pat McGrath is like she's
awesome
um I really like the movie the girl with
Dragon Tattoo and she did all the
concept makeup for that movie I don't
know that yeah and she's also like she
does runway makeup she's probably like
the most famous makeup artist living
mm-hmm well maybe all-time debate in the
comments if you thought anyway um I
really liked the the purple in the pink
palette and I asked Logan if he would
get that for me for my birthday because
it's like the one thing I want so like
the swatches are insane yeah like those
are those aren't crazy and I like that
they're so they're smaller and they're
less expensive yeah because I'm someone
who I don't mind and I was talking about
this recently with the mini natasha Dona
like sunset palette I don't mind
smaller and less product because I'm so
like handed like Georgia was opening up
my palettes earlier no you're not light
handed with the Kat Von D B that's just
a very intense palette
so every again that's in her get ready
with baby yeah oh yes I used the Kat Von
D me vida loca
yeah am I saying that right yeah I used
that pallet it was a little pottery yeah
that wasn't it definitely wasn't my
fault
I'm very light hand it no yeah I have
never hit pan like on anything ever I
can't I get like I just can't imagine
using up an eyeshadow palette so for me
I would prefer to buy something smaller
and cheaper cuz it just makes more sense
Jamie I'm not someone who really cares
about like cost per gram or like cost
per ounce cuz I'm very rarely going
through anything at all I do think the
cost per gram thing helps you determine
like the value of something but I'm also
someone who doesn't use products too
often I haven't though because I've
started a project panning so but even
even that I still don't go through too
much stuff yeah
so I'm I'm interested because I've
always wanted to try her eyeshadows just
so I could like yeah so I could try it
but all her other halls have been so
expensive oh my god I don't think I can
do it but smaller palette cheaper price
I do like how with the bigger pack the
the bigger palettes they're like 125
dollars and they're in black lacquer
casing but the packaging that come with
has that really beautiful the artwork
the like the three models with all the
different makeup on but like you take
that packaging off and then like the
palettes just black lacquer but the
actual palette itself for the minis is
the packaging it's like oh okay okay
so I thought that was real long yeah
that is cool yeah if I were to get one I
have a feeling you get that warm one
yeah yeah the Browns ambition does seem
like my channel is it okay I was even
using George's pilot today like this is
the I like I came up with I put two
Purple's on my nose like you really
stepped outside your box look at those
Purple's I didn't even know that was it
it was also really hard to film art get
ready with me we thumped for an hour and
it felt like it was ten minutes over an
hour over an hour because we had
we watch the Garrity preps I'm involved
in there's a lot of prep time uh but
yeah that was that was this was the most
of that I could do I do think it's
really good
back to the Pat McGrath ballots how it's
a like a smaller quantity smaller price
point obviously fifty five dollars for
an eyeshadow palette it's not gonna be
accessible to a lot of people so like
it's not drugs drug pricing or anything
like that but um it is a little bit more
affordable than 100 yeah twenty-five
dollars for sure more for well not yeah
you know that's why I'm like if I'm
gonna do it for Pat McGrath like I think
this is probably the way to go I do
think it's smart I I'd be interested I'm
always curious to know like how many
units of stuff people sell I don't
waiting we can't like call them up and
they're gonna tell us but I do think III
have a feeling that she's probably
probably some more units of the smaller
pallets in total than the larger pallets
I could see that yeah you know I can see
that hose do you look really pretty
though that one's like a maybe for me or
like a solid maybe for me yeah though
Besame cosmetics they released a
snow-white collection for their back and
now they're coming out some new items
for including two new eyeshadow palettes
yep wait I think um I like putting um I
feel like I'm talking so much and it's
you were kidding me this is fun for me
I want more guests get here recently so
I originally I had originally made a
video last year and I was like a wish
list makeup video and I talked about the
first
Besame snow white pillow and it was like
oh man shadows and I prefer matte
shadows overall so I was like I kind of
wonky at this one but then I was like
almost $70 and I was this like me cuz
best mate never came out with any
eyeshadows before that so it's like I've
never tried this formula you don't know
if it's gonna be good they're not
accepting returns you know it's a
limited edition so it's like final sales
and then um some people did some review
videos I mean you know it was like makes
like other people saying was like okay
or they loved it or like whatever I was
like yeah okay I guess I can take the
plunge and then I said they were gonna
restock that pallet movie never did but
then these two new pallets are I think
they're all shimmery eyeshadows oh
really yeah so they're not Matt's so I'm
probably not gonna get them just for
that reason just cuz I I wouldn't
I don't really prefer I like I prefer
all maths or like mostly Matt unless
it's like shimmers or foils of color
that I really really like and I like the
packaging more than I like that they
never this mm-hmm
I reload the packaging he loves my white
part of me is looks like get the
packaging take the shadows okay put new
ones in yeah there you go
oh my gosh like trans transplant palace
organ donation if anyone can do it Evie
oh gosh it would be you I guess somebody
will be like why don't you like the
original colors once opposed with the
textures yeah if it's an all shimmer
palette I wouldn't be interested in
either but it's funny looking at these
two palettes like they're shades and
each then I want like I would want to
create my own as well yeah I feel like I
would like it more if it was like one
palette and then like cut out some of
those mm-hmm some of the colors yeah I
agree I heard that it was all shimmer
I'm not under censure but I have heard
that animal which would make sense cuz
the first palette they released was all
mattes I can see that yeah that one's
probably gonna be a no for me
I haven't curious that brand though I
like the vintage I tried lipstick
formula it's really good is it yeah good
so then we have the moon glow halo
highlight by giving me glow cosmetics am
I saying that correct oh it says look
who's making a comeback from 2015 halo
from give me goloka husband isn't my
memory great you're seriously it really
is I've always thought I had a fairly
good memory but you're just like she
remembers the first video that she
watched from me did you figure out which
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and she asked
me that I dunno I was like do you
remember the first video of MIUI she's
like yeah like I don't know a good
memory yeah do you really do that so
this highlight
came out in 2015 now it's coming back
that how it looks in the same yeah it's
really insane i I've never tried
anything from give me glow cosmetics um
I heard I really think I've really heard
much about them as far as like product
quality same the photo looks great the
photo looks insane since I don't know
what else to say um I would want that
only if I could guarantee that it would
look like that on me yeah but I
sometimes feel like I buy highlighters
and it's like better on other people
yeah me yeah I am
I'm very intrigued by this one I don't
really pretty I worry what it'd look
good on me to like I don't know wearing
the blue highlighted that's true I used
the mood child in Georgia brought this
as well and I opened it up I was like I
need to wear something so I put on blue
ice is my highlight but I might do it
how much is it doesn't say it doesn't
they I think it's like in the upper 20
almost $30 price range but it's like a
big it's a bit it's a very large I don't
like it when they put it all over their
fingers me who I don't likes watching it
all whenever I see that oh my god no me
lady did you oh my gosh Katie Murray you
probably know this cuz you posted this
on Twitter tart posted a photo it would
know it was a video and they were
advertising their chrome paint shadows
and they it was a red one and then they
were rubbing it all over their hands
like no it's like Java this thing is
going in a bad way they look like they
murdered someone that's going in a bad
place and then I remember like it can't
you post it on Twitter and she's like
that's an interesting way to sell your
product hurt yes let's bathe in the
blood of our enemies but but it was just
like red metallic bright red hands I
wanna look it up now
we might find it I'm gonna like it up
we're looking on Katie's Twitter right
now Katie what's terrifying okay we
couldn't find the photo but I you know
what we're talking about so vouches for
us in the conference yes please do I
want to see it alright back to the
highlighter I do I I'm interested I
don't know if I would say I'm good
percent but I'm curious about this one I
hope that I would look good on me did
they still using compact so they just
sell it as the pan that's a good
question hey come oh they're okay so it
isn't a compact looks like it has a
mirror too so that's good I think it's
pretty
mMmmm I feel like I want see other
people yeah I'm gonna see what it looks
like yeah yeah it's also one of those
things where I think it just it looks
really good in the photo and then you
get it and you're like just not the same
yeah it just doesn't correlate the same
yeah so that one's like a navy I was
like maybe maybe the first maybe maybe I
feel like the like last week - I felt
like was kind of like a slower
week I found this week was cut because I
felt we got hit with a
release is like going on bamm-bamm so I
kind of don't mind being able to like
there's nothing I'm absolutely yeah like
have to have type of thing sometimes
like when it comes with makeup releases
what a bunch of things you like release
all at once and you're like there's no
way I can get all this and then they'll
be like a dry spell and it's like none
of this is interesting
we're so we're so hard to please those
makeup lovers so we're gonna end the
wilai by talking about some celebrity
makeup lines there's a lot of celebs
coming out their own lines apparently
everyone's jumping on that train
everyone needs to come out with a makeup
line George and I are actually if we're
announcing our collaboration pickup line
in this video link below or what else is
crazy we could sell dog sweaters shake
weights shake weights with dogs like
dawn shake weights dachshunds it's just
a dachshund and you shake it nobody feel
that idea oh my god you heard it here my
gosh really I do
okay so Bella Thorne that's coming out
and makeup line yeah very vague just
like someone she posted a selfie
everyone's like we like your lip color
which I like that's like the last thing
I would comment about that photo like I
don't think it's a bad lip color but I'm
not like oh my god it's amazing yeah um
she just said my upcoming makeup line
yeah I feel like Bella Thorne isn't
really my my bag I think she's um you
know maybe like a younger kid I should
be more interested in her um probably
not gonna buy anything unless if she
comes up with like the world's best
makeup and obviously but I would feel
like it's probably gonna be as of right
now just the feeling I'm getting it's
probably just gonna be like a generic
you know makeup line by a celebrity I
have that same feeling yeah I do
and I'm not super familiar with all the
thorn but from like the very little I
know I'm not I don't feel like we're on
the same we don't have same bias we're
not at the scene we're not in the same
stage of our life yeah yeah there you go
what do you think about Jennifer Lopez
you know what's sad I don't know if you
can screenshot in the comments when
people would trend me post this photo
everyone was like that looks orange I
was gonna say that's not the I don't
feel like that's the best photo to
announce a makeup line yeah because it
doesn't look it looks like me at all got
in last night
she bored she wore bad foundation and
oxidized really bad at her
Oh her it was awesome it was great
weights mine that story further and they
get ready with me as well I do I do like
Jenny from a block and I do like JLo did
you ever watch the movie made in
Manhattan oh yeah I mean like I in
salina I have good values Jennifer Lopez
mm-hmm um I don't have like the world's
strongest like connection with her is
like you know like there's just certain
celebrities or certain people you just
really like I'd like her and I like some
of the stuff in her music but I'm not
like oh my god she's coming with a
makeup line like that's not my immediate
reaction I do feel that I would give her
makeup Lane more priority than the Bella
formal yeah same here
yeah same here I'm actually I'm pretty
interested in Jennifer Lopez for me like
she says I have a crush on her oh really
yeah I do I have for a long time either
think so she's such a boss she inspires
me she does so much and she's so like
multi-talented and oh yeah
I she yeah I was a very um the the
wedding planner oh yeah it was like my
hand to comedy she's been in like I'm
not really a romantic comedy person but
I love when she's been in yeah yeah I
saw I'll be curious to see what she
comes out with it sounds like it's going
to be a bronzer which definitely has a
warmth in the caption but you know what
some of those really warm tone bronzers
look really good on people mm-hmm but I
feel like um I feel like a lot of people
are really trying to do the like cool
tone yeah neutral bronzer hmm yeah I'm
interested to see what she'll she'll put
out uh-huh
I'll have my eye on Jennifer Lopez but
what about Serena Williams I think this
was really interesting the only thing I
know about Serena Williams is her tennis
career mhm and that's about it
I didn't realize but then again I'm not
watching interviews with her I don't
really watch anything about her so I
didn't realize that she had an interest
in makeup and like when it comes to like
Jennifer Lopez like you know she was a
singer and actress like you know stage
performing makeup like that make sense
but um you know what if she was coming
out with makeup that's like like
water-resistant like for like because
you don't really go where yeah water
take water sit makeup like a lot of
people like to wear like waterproof
makeup to the
and stuff like that we really I don't
feel like there's really any line that
specialized this is Anna so I that would
make sense I think it'd be cool if she's
going in that direction yeah I'll be
curious cuz yeah like I said when I
think of Serena Williams I don't
necessarily always think of like make up
vibes no shafe her make up blow because
there's a lot of like Jennifer Lopez's
looks that I can't recall in my head but
like Serena Williams like most I just
see I'm chann square yeah which is
awesome yeah she's fantastic
but yeah makeup line I was kind of
surprised when I saw that I thought I'm
not gonna lie but which I'm not like
some people who were very much like why
I should commit with a makeup line
because she's a tennis player and it's
like appliance oh really that doesn't
bother me and then the last one I don't
have the finger pull up here but Lindsay
Lohan oh my gosh wasn't she on Wendy
Williams she was on the Wendy Williams
TV show and Wendy Williams was a near
viewing her and she's like yeah coming
over makeup line oh that's where I can
okay I don't know that shockingly um I
feel I feel so bad for Lindsay like I
really loved Mean Girls and Freaky
Friday and like everyday pair trap yeah
sure like that's like my golden my
golden memory of Lindsay Lohan and then
ever since then it's just been yeah I
wish her all the success in the world
for her makeup line just because I do
have those fond memories of her from
when I was a kid watching her movies
mm-hmm and I do feel really bad with all
the stuff that's happened to her in her
life in her career um then again she's
also when those people were I don't
think like I don't think Lindsay Lohan
and makeup I think Lindsay Lohan in
rehab which is sad because that's that's
been her legacy
yeah for lately and I do feel like she
has just from what I've heard I feel
like she has done so burden and then
more stapl in her life but still I I
still don't think of like makeup
I think her yeah I don't either I think
when I I feel like I recall seeing
photos of her it and she's never really
someone who wears a lot of makeup to me
mm-hmm
like just the random I mean it hasn't
been a lot of photos because she hasn't
I don't think she's done any work no
recently but she's been in a few movies
here and there yeah she wasn't really
big
um like blockbusters ya later like
anything that's like super noteworthy
yeah so I don't know I just I want to
thank Mako for her either and I don't
sometimes I just feel like she has so
many that I was attached to her yeah I'm
not sure how I would feel about
supporting her makeup line but out of
all of them we mentioned to Jennifer
Lopez I'm watching the most oh yeah it
was him she comes out or maybe like
Jennifer little Jennifer Lopez Serena
Williams Lindsay Lohan to them Bella
Thorne in that order so yeah same that
is going to be it or this will I buy a
