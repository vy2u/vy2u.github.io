today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my live by videos every
single Wednesday where I'm talking about
some new makeup releases and launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then letting you know if I'm
planning to pick them up or pass over
them as always I have so much to talk
about in this week's little eye by video
so why don't we go ahead and get started
so the first item I want to talk about
actually came available to purchase
today as I'm filming this morning and
all of a sudden I hopped on my Instagram
this morning just to see what was going
on and I had so many new tags and I
thought what just became available and I
have no idea how so many people knew
that I would be super excited over those
I found this very strange I don't know
how you guys did it but Sephora is
releasing a new Sephora favorites
collection with their give me more lip

am super super stoked about this one so
this is or from the Sephora page a multi
branded mega lip set with 15 lipsticks
two glasses two lip creams including
five full-size products and ten lip
colors and deluxe sizes you guys know
how much I love the Sephora I mean some
lip collections I especially loved their
give me some nude lip collections I buy
every single one of those but I just
love these lips ups in general I find
them to be such a good value you get to
try out different brands you get to try
out different lipstick formulas try out
different shades and I absolutely love
it I typically do not miss one
especially the nude lip one when I saw
like the Big Daddy pain really sounds
like yes I will have a photo of it down
here but everything in the set like just
get ready for this so you get an Anasazi

I'm excited about this so it is $68 it
says it's a 250 $4 value it is a limited
edition it does not list on the sephora
app at least which ones are full size so
I'm not sure if I can find that out I
will leave it in the description box
down below I can list the 5 that are
full sizes in case that would make or
break this for you but you get all of
these different lip products for $68 and
yes I'm so excited I will be purchasing
this I'm super bummed out because I
actually placed a Sephora order this
morning and it said it was available for
sale but every time I was clicking on it
it says the link was broken I was not
able to add it to my cart I did put it
on my loves list so the next time that I
ordered from Sephora I do plan on
picking it up for myself because I'm so
excited about this I'm so bummed it
wasn't working this morning I'm not sure
what was going on but I needed to get my
order placed and you know get on with my
workday but I'm super excited I hope
that it doesn't sell out intense the lip
sets do sell out but Sephora is
typically pretty good at bringing them
back at least one more time said I mean
I purchased these so often I think they
are such a good value there's so many in
here that I would be excited to have and
I think the only one that I have out of
all of these is the huda beauty lipstick
in bombshell movem I've tried like the
tarte rainforest of the sea one I've
tried that oh I actually have it on
today I've tried the anasazi lip gloss
I've tried the Marc Jacobs Lamarck and
the Smashbox but those are the only ones
I've actually tried and then everything
else would be new to me but those shades
I don't have and I'd be excited to have
new shades in all of those so I am super
pumped about this I think that's awesome
that you get 5 full sizes you know I'm
excited about it I'll leave a link to it
down below hopefully the link is now
working or is working by the time this
video goes up but I definitely am
planning on purchasing this new mega
Sephora give me some lip collection
quite a few tags and questions on what
my thoughts were on the
latest and nikkietutorials and over
cosmetics collaboration so
nikkietutorials who is a mega huge
youtuber I think she has like over 7
million subscribers small-potatoes
really she has done a collaboration with
over cosmetics in the past for a
highlight and then a couple of lipsticks
and she is coming back and doing a new
collaboration with them but what this
new collaboration over by
nikkietutorials is called glow baby glow
the collection includes a couple
different highlighters is glazed donut
glow goals and blind the haters those
are the three names of the highlights
those are all $29 she has a new liquid
lipstick with Oprah which is called
Dutchess it's a mauve berry and it's $20
everything is sold separately and I
thought it was really interesting
because with her first collaboration
they released like a highlighter little
trio so it had the three different
shades in it and basically what they did
is they took each of the three different
shades in there and they made them into
their own separate pan so that was
pretty cool I definitely noticed a lot
of people saying that when that
collection releases oh you know oh I
wish these were you know separate
highlights and so I think that's really
awesome that a company really listened
to everyone and then came out and like
revamped everything I think one of the
colors is just a little bit different so
it's blind the haters I'm reading from
dread moon now so her Instagram page
will be listed down below it says blind
the haters is a tweaked and better
version of the most golden shade in the
ever glow highlighter trio not gonna buy
any of the highlighters I will say
though that Dutchess gave me that double
take I was like mmm mmm mom very that
looks like a nice liquid lipstick I
really do like though for a liquid
lipsticks as well I think they're really
nice I just tried them for the first
time actually in the last couple months
and I would definitely recommend them
I've had a great time using them I am
gonna pass over the entire collection
though well I do like over cosmetics I
did purchase one of their highlighters
in the Ulta 21 days of beauty they just
had their highlighters half off and I am
anxiously awaiting that package to get
to me so I'm excited to try it an Oprah
highlighter but to me that means why go
out and buy another go for a highlighter
when I just bought one especially
because I bought that one at half off
which is a lot better than $30 for a
highlighter and while the liquid
lipstick really didn't treat me I
actually had two lipsticks in my Sephora
cart this morning and I ever so bravely
took them out mmm
them out that was hard to do I know I
just don't need it right now to be on
this I enjoy nikkietutorials i watch
almost every single one of her videos
her tutorials are friggin like on a
different level I have a lot of fun
watching her videos but I don't really
connect with her on any sort of like
friendship level that I do with a lot of
other youtubers out there I just don't
like really feel that connection with
her so it's not a collaboration that you
know a lot of times with these youtuber
collaborations I'm really buying for the
youtubers and I'm really excited and I
want to support and I just again not
saying I don't like making tutorials or
I wouldn't want to support her I just
don't feel that urge and I would rather
put that money towards a different
collaboration that I really feel I
really feel something for you know but I
think the collection is really cool and
again I'm excited that over really
listened to the feedback and then made
these separate highlighters I think
that's pretty darn cool so obviously
like I said Nicki has over 7 million
YouTube subscribers so I'm sure a lot of
you are subscribed to her and love her
so I would love to know if you were
planning on picking up anything from
this new collection stuff I have a new
release from colour-pop cosmetics
because they always release them
something so they just came out with
another new eyeshadow palette this one
is it called the I think I love you
palette is a pretty warm toned palette
it has 12 different shades and it is $16
so I'll have a picture of it included
down here I thought it was interesting
the day that it released I think it was
last week that it released I kind of
forgot about it and it was you know a
couple hours later I saw a few tanks
coming down Instagram asking if I got it
and I was like let me go over the color
pup website so I went over there and I
was like oh my gosh I'm shocked this
thing is still in stock I can't believe
it I cannot believe it is still in stock
because one of their other most recent
palettes the yesplease palette has gone
out within like 10 minutes and they've
done what two or three different
restocks of it and it continually sells
out in just minutes I just checked
before I started filming it's still
available I'm like how come what so how
come the guest please keeps going out so
fast because I would have rather have
the yesplease palette and I just missed
it every single restock though this was
one that I tried to convince myself to
buy I got on the colour-pop website
and I saw it was still there and I added
it to my bag and then I thought do you
really want that like do you really and
this was kind of the whole point of
these will i buy videos they're inspired
from the anti haul to just stop and
think about what you're buying why are
you really buying that makeup do you
really need that makeup I mean I just on
autopilot it was like I saw so many
people talking about it and being
excited about it and asking me to review
it I go I saw it was in stock boom AG
bag and then I just had to stop and
think why are you buying this take a
second take a second look at the pallet
so I took a second or five or ten I know
I looked at the pallet and I was like I
don't need this I don't need this yes
it's sixteen dollars for an eyeshadow
palette and that's fantastic but I don't
need it it kind of is like that really
kind of basic palette which I am all
about I love those palettes I reach for
those pellets so much but guess what
that means I have a lot of those
palettes
so what what is it about this palette
that makes it so special and different
and unique then I need to go ahead and
buy it and I couldn't answer that
question but I I have pellets like these
there isn't really anything besides that
really beautiful like yellow gold that I
see that was the only shade that like
drew my attention that I was like ooh
that looks really pretty but I have that
shade I thought I didn't do any sort of
double take the only the double take
that I did was oh my word color pop is
releasing another eyeshadow palette I
didn't do a double-take I didn't get
excited for it I didn't immediately
start thinking of different looks I
could do so I didn't buy it I always say
my will i buy videos i want to buy the
makeup that makes me do a double-take i
want to buy the makeup that gets me
excited i want to buy the makeup that
i'm like oh if I don't buy that it's
gonna end up in one of those makeup that
I regret not buying videos and this one
just didn't do it so I passed over it
and I think I'm gonna be okay with that
I think I'm gonna be okay with that so
next up is most definitely been the most
asked and most requested to include a
no-bull I buy a video this has been
asked for me to include it in a will I
buy a video when we first heard the line
was launching and we didn't even know
what the heck was gonna be in it
I can now finally talk about it because
it has now since released of course I'm
of course talking about Fanta beauty at
the new
make up line from Rihanna she came out
with a collection that includes blotting
powder brushes more blotting paper
foundation primer a brush makeup blender
these matchsticks is what they are
called concealers contour concealer
brushes a gloss balm highlighters and a
highlighting brush I mean she released a
full-on collection you know I'm kind of
glad that we were just kind of on the
topic of what I was saying with the
color pop palette because it really is a
nice segue into this one because I feel
like I have a really unpopular opinion
here and I feel like I'm probably even
gonna make a lot of people mad with what
I'm about to say about fenty beauty but
I just could not get into the hype about
this and I don't know why I like Rihanna
I like Brianna's music I love her her
vibe of you know being such an empowered
woman I love that I love that she
created a makeup line I was excited to
see what she was releasing because I was
super curious about it but I just never
felt I just I just never felt like I was
like come on and I can't wait for this
to get here
like I was just kind of casually sitting
back like oh well we'll have to see what
it is that she releases and I'll have to
see what catches my attention and to be
honest you know I was watching the snaps
I was watching everybody at the findi
Beauty event and seeing with our
swatches I've watched a ton of videos
you know everybody and their mother and
their aunts and their hairdresser has
now put on videos about Fendi Beauty a
lot of people were running to Sephora
I mean straight running to Sephora to
get the items and all the while I'm just
kind of sitting here like I don't know
guys I I can't
I'm just I don't I don't know got in so
many snaps of people saying you need to
buy this and you need to buy that and
you need to buy this and you have to buy
this one and I'm like okay okay okay and
I just can't do it I will say in my
Sephora order that I placed this morning
they were having as part of one of their
like weekly specials was a free
foundation sample so I went ahead and
picked up one of the foundation samples
I'm just to test it out I think I think
what Rihanna did was freaking
I love this big huge collection I love
the 40 different shades of foundation I
think that's frickin bomb there's
literally a shade for everybody going
through those shades and seeing how they
describe each person's skin tone it's
like the lower like they did not leave
anybody out and I think that's freaking
awesome
I love love that items haven't been
selling out like freaking crazy because
the launch was that like midnight I
think it was 2:00 a.m. my time that the
launch was when I went onto safar the
next morning I was like everything's
gonna be gone like what I'm not even
going on what everything's gonna be gone
everything wasn't stock like a couple
foundation shades I think we're on a
stock I literally expected it to be
completely dry and everything was still
there and I was like thank you like
finally a makeup brand that doesn't
order such a limited freaking amount of
quantities that it sells out in two
hours because guess what that's not fun
for your consumers and I hate when
people are like oh I'm just so excited
it's sold out why so more people can't
get your products I think that's crap a
single round is a classy lady I think
she's a smart businesswoman and I think
down the line I might purchase from
Fenty but at this time I just couldn't
super get into it I really enjoy
highlighters so it kind of thought once
I saw some of the highlighter it sounds
like oh I might be going for those but
they look very glittery and how I've
seen a lot of people apply it and I see
what they look like and I just don't
think the shades would look super great
on me and I don't like glittery
highlights I've said that before in the
past and I don't like it and I'm seeing
people do the swatches on their arms and
then their entire arm is full of glitter
and I'm like I don't want that on my
face I just don't I don't really need
any makeup tools like brushes or sponges
H and I was interested in but I went
ahead and got that sample instead of
just going out right away and buying a
full-size bunch of these like blotting
papers and blotting powders I'd never
used those so that wouldn't do anything
for me I know a lot of people are really
excited about this gloss balm the lip
gloss I just don't really wear lip
glosses like I don't wear them a lot and
what I have in my collection I'm
completely suffice with it concealer
sticks there's like these they're called
the match sticks and I'm you can either
buy them separately or they have some in
a trio for a little cheaper price those
kind of caught my attention but not
enough to be like I really need to buy
these and
this was one that I wanted to talk about
because the hype is so real right now
around Fanta beauty it is so real and so
high and I have so many people telling
me I need to buy it and I need to buy it
and I'm over here like I don't really
need anything nothing is really catching
my attention I'm not super excited about
anything I didn't really do a
double-take a lot of the items don't fit
with my makeup vibes but I kept feeling
that pressure I was like you have to buy
something people are going to be mad at
you if you don't buy something people
are gonna mad at you if you're not
reviewing like you know not only do you
say you're a makeup lover but you're a
youtuber you have to buy stuff people
are literally telling me emailing me
DMing me snapping me you have to you
have to but I don't have to it's my
money I get to do what I want to do with
it just like I always tell all of you
guys you get to do what you want to do
with your money and if there's makeup
that you're not super interested in for
whatever reason it may be if you're not
interested in it you don't have to buy
it you don't have to feel like you need
to fit in with everybody else and just
because everybody else likes one thing
and you don't that's fine you don't
always have to fit in you don't always
have to buy what everybody else is
buying you don't always have to buy the
most hyped makeup that there is out
there the biggest reason for it is just
not a lot of it is my makeup vibes
that's basically bottom line even though
sometimes brands might release things
that I say that I don't need or that
aren't my vibes if I'm really loyal to
the brand sometimes I'll still do it if
it's a youtuber influencer that I feel
like a very strong connection with I
will still do it
centi beauty is brand new so I'm not a
loyal to the brand in any way and while
I do like Rihanna she is a huge
celebrity and I don't feel like a
connection with Rihanna in that way so
those are just a couple of the reasons
why I didn't immediately gravitate
towards the collection I do think a lot
of what's in there though is super
interesting like I said I got that
foundation sample if I try the
foundation sample and I absolutely love
it I'm gonna have
no problem at all purchasing a full-size
there wasn't enough in this collection
that made me want it that made me like
oh no if I wake up in the morning it's
gonna be sold out so I'm gonna sleep
until 2 I am to get it it just didn't do
that and I really want to be careful and
try not to fall into just buying makeup
to buy makeup just buying makeup to say
I have it just buying makeup to do a
YouTube video that's not how I want to
build my makeup collection and that's
not the advice and want to give to
anybody watching this video because I
understand it can be so easy to get kind
of like sucked into this like YouTube
makeup addiction and I'm here to say
that that happened to me for sure I've
had my channel for almost two years
there is so much makeup that I bought
just review it just to make a youtube
video just because other people told me
I had to have it just because I got
sucked into the hype and I was like oh
my gosh if I don't have this I'm not a
real freaking youtuber type of thing I
totally did that and that's not a good
thing and I don't want that to keep
happening I wanted to kind of touch on
that as I talked about centi beauty
because this was one that I struggled
with a lot when I saw all of the snaps
and the Instagram tags and everybody on
Twitter telling me you have to have this
you have to do this I'm like why am I
gonna go out and buy something that I
don't think is gonna look good on my
skin I didn't go out and buy a lip gloss
when I can't remember the last time I
bought a lip gloss I am I gonna do all
of those things just to fit in yeah I'm
not going to so I'm excited to see what
Rihanna comes out with next for Fanta
beauty like I'm so excited like I said I
really think that she did this makeup
line right I love that things weren't
selling out I love that huge range of
foundation I'm excited I'll let you guys
know what I think about my foundation
sample when it comes in I'm excited to
see if it works out well for me and I'm
just excited to see what she comes out
with next you know maybe things will be
more of my personal makeup style maybe
I'll feel like things would work better
for you know my particular skin tone or
just what I like on me in general and I
would totally be open to it I'm not
against Rihanna or Fanta beauty in the
slightest centi is Rihanna's last name
if anybody didn't know I learned that
personally from AB and endings video I
am completely open to purchasing from
the line in the future if something
catches my attention and if
I think I would really love it in my
makeup collection so those are kind of
my thoughts there and I would love to
hear what you guys have to think about
that too like have you ever had and you
know I'm sure a lot of you have but have
you ever had those makeup purchases that
you did and then you were like I think I
did it for the wrong reasons
you know things like that I would kind
of love to know some of your thoughts on
that and get your feedback because it
was something that I just really wanted
to talk about and address in this video
and actually you know as nervous as I
was to talk about that because I feel
like a lot of people might come back in
a rude manner but hopefully it also
makes some of you guys think about the
makeup purchases that you're making too
and you know your shirt makeup isn't the
most serious thing in the world but
money is money is very serious and
sometimes when I take a look and I see
how much money I've spent on makeup in a
month because I track all of my
purchases it hurts hey I was able to
open up a good discussion with some of
you and give you something to think
about I'd love to know your thoughts but
after that that's gonna do it for this
week's will I buy a video okay so that
is everything for this week's will I buy
video I'd love to know what you think
about everything that I mentioned what
are you buying what are you passing over
I'd love to know your thoughts on some
of like the consumerism a chat that I
wanted to have in this week's video as
well I hope that you will also let me
know what you want to see in next week's
will I buy a video and as always if you
do enjoy this video or found it helpful
I hope that you will give it a thumbs up
I hope that you will also consider
subscribing before you though and I'll
catch you guys real soon in my next one
right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
