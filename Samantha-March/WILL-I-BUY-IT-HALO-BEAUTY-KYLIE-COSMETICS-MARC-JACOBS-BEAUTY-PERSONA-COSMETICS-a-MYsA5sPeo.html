today's video is going to be a new well
I buy it if plus know about videos every
single Wednesday where I'm chatting
about new makeup releases and launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then also talking over if I'm
planning to pick them up or pass over
them and as always I have a lot to
discuss this week so why don't we go
ahead and get started
all right first up I have some new
highlighters here from the brand persona
cosmetics so I'm reading from the
treadmill on Instagram so I'll have her
Instagram link down below like I
normally do
I didn't see this morning I got an email
from Ulta beauty saying it was there was
a bunch of platinum perks today and I
have a platinum member at Ulta so I
clicked on the email to see what all the
perks were and I saw this persona
highlight and for whatever reason I was
like mmm looks like an interesting
highlight like it gave me an the double
take right away so there's three
different shades they're $24 each and
they are permanent you're not familiar
with persona cosmetics it was started by
a beauty blogger a Sonia and I know that
she released a shadow palette and that
palette has gotten a ton of good reviews
a lot of people say really good things
about it so I personally have never
tried persona cosmetics myself I'm not
super familiar with the creator of the
brand but I've gotten to kind of know
the story a little bit more and
especially seeing how well the eyeshadow
palette went over it's definitely
something a brand that has caught my
attention like I said it was just an
email this morning but for whatever
reason the highlights are something that
kind of drew my attention is $24 for one
highlight which I do definitely feel
like is expensive you can find persona
cosmetics at Ulta beauty of course those
things that you mail came from Ulta
beauty so that's a good thing because I
prefer to order from like Ulta I like
getting rid of or it's like keeping up
my Platinum membership your said I'm
interested in the three shades I think I
would go for the middle shade which i
think is called Zuma don't quote me
though but that's the one that I feel
like would work well for me so I'm
interested in this and I'm kind of I'm
kind of looking at it but then at the
same time I'm looking at my highlight
collection I have plenty i've just
gotten several new highlights I have a
new highlight from Becca cosmetics newer
to me on my face today so it's like do I
really really need to spend $24 on
another
I lied probably not so if I'm if I'm
keeping more on my practical side I'm
gonna say that I'll probably end up
passing over them I know that also 21
days of beauty is coming up but I think
I don't know $24 is a lot of money to
spend on a highlight and just knowing
how how how well my highlight collection
is how stocked it is and how many
highlights that I love like I'm trying
to pan or at least like make it tiny the
smallest of indentations on my mary-lou
manizer for my 2018 project pan and i
feel like i use it every five days
because there's always another
highlighter in my collection that I'm
interested in or I'm wanting to try out
or I got a new highlight or something so
it's like do I really need that probably
not so it caught my attention I think
they look really pretty I'm definitely
very intrigued by the brand but
practicality wise I think I'm gonna go
ahead and say that I'm not gonna pick
this one up but I would love to know are
you excited for this one are you
planning on getting a highlight did you
get the eyeshadow palette that seems
like so many people really enjoy I would
love to know but I'm gonna skip over the
persona highlighters I sure did get
quite a lot of tags on this release from
market Jacobs Beauty I really enjoy the
Marc Jacobs makeup brand I have a lap
from the line and a lot that I really
really love so I started getting tags on
this coconut collection with rose gold
details says it's limited edition will
be available April 24th on the website
and online at Sephora and then May 11th
in stores so there's a new eyeshadow
palette one of the iconic palettes and
it's $49 and I love the tones inside
this one I really do I like the pinky
tones I like that there's a gold in
there I'm really into the Pink's right
now so this palette this palette has me
doing a little bit of a side eye but ahh
$49 for an eyeshadow palettes huh you
get seven seven shades inside and then
there is a mirror with it but mmm-hmm
like this is another one that it's gonna
like go on my wish list and I don't know
when the next VIP sale is coming up I
always kind of get them mixed up but I
know also 21 days of beauty is coming
and I
feel like a VIP sale usually is
somewhere around the time of altar 21
days of beauty what are you guys what do
you think when is the next vib sale
coming like I feel like I want it and I
want to try it and I want those pinky
tones but at the same time also looking
at this palette for some reason that
looking at the swatches I feel like like
the first palette that popped into my
mind was the BH Cosmetics and Carli
bybel palette and I don't know if it's
because I just wore that palette the
other day
and I was also just talking about it in
a March Madness video but like a couple
of these pink shades in there remind me
of that palette and then also I feel
like I could very much easily dupe this
one with the jaclyn hill morphe palette
as well i mean that one has 35 shades in
there it definitely has a lot of those
pink tones in there the peach tones in
there at the golden there so it's like
do I really need to spend $49 on this
one from Marc Jacobs but I'm I mean I
can't lie and say that I'm not
interested and that I did make me do a
double take because it did but I still
think $49 for the 7 pan palette
I mean Marc Jacobs is just it's an
expensive brand it just is it just is
but I don't know what do you guys think
about the hi shadow palette I think I'm
gonna stay strong and say no to it but
it definitely caught my attention that
one was a bit hard to talk myself out of
but you know what the two palettes that
I mentioned maybe I mean I will be okay
saying no to an eyeshadow palette right
like I'll be okay also in the collection
there is new dew drops the coconut gel
highlighter into fantasy which is $44
the dew drops I actually bought the last
time they came out I think this is a
different shade is what I'm
understanding but I bought those I want
to say it was doing a vib sale because I
don't think I would have paid full price
for it and I just I like it and I I did
wear it quite a bit in the summertime I
will say that but I just don't reach for
liquid highlights a ton and I feel like
that one definitely gets very much like
neglected ons $44 I know that I would
skip over that and then and then there
is the Omega tan tastic bronzer for $49
I am getting that bronzer nobody tried
to talk about this one I learned at this
browser so bad when this browser came
out and then I
I talked myself out of it I said no girl
it's too expensive you don't need that
bronzer and then everybody went on to
love that bronzer and I was like I made
make a mistake okay and I even put the
bronzer in one of my regrets the what
would it be at the makeup I regret not
buying or whatever that one's called Oh
with my regret series down below but I
was like man I sat on that bronzer and i
sat on that bronzer and I said no and I
said it was too expensive and I didn't
do it and then everybody went on to love
that bronzer and I was like please come
back please come back with that brother
so they are coming back and this one you
guys I want it okay if it's made it in
to my regret video and now it's coming
back I feel like I feel like I deserved
that from there okay I said no the first
time I don't want to say no a second
time so that's what I think about Marc
Jacobs bronzer okay who else talked
themselves out of it and then went on to
regret it because everybody said it was
like a great bronze so you know not
everybody of course not everybody loves
one thing I've already hates one thing
but I feel like it got really good
reviews and I still like I continually
see people using this I see it hanging
around into clutters even though it was
a limited edition a lot of times you see
limited edition items get decluttered
people are still keeping that bronzer
it's a big old bronzer I don't think
I'll ever get through it or hip pain or
do anything on it but it's one that I
want it for a really long time so I
think out of the collection I definitely
do want to get the bronzer and you know
maybe that will help me to say no to the
eyeshadow palette again it caught my
attention I think it looks really pretty
but mmm I can do it with others in my
collection and if I'm gonna purchase the
bronzer like I would rather go that
route that's of what I feel about the
Marc Jacobs collection that is coming
out what do you guys think is there
anything from here that you absolutely
have to have can you say no to
everything and who else's get that
bronzer with me just let me know I'm
just curious just curious so next up I'm
going to talk about Kylie cosmetics
I don't normally touch on Kylie
cosmetics in my will I buy up videos
because I have said in past videos will
i buy it videos when I used to do anti
haul videos which has been a really long
time since I've done one of those but I
have stated before in the past that I
don't support Kylie cosmetics and I
don't buy from them so after a while it
just seemed kind of pointless to be
including items
from a brand that I've been vocal about
not supporting in my will i buy it
videos but it has been a very long time
since I have talked about Kylie
cosmetics and video I know my channel is
definitely grown since probably the last
time that I included her brand in one of
my videos so I thought I could touch on
it and give you some of my thoughts
because I definitely do see comments
from people who are newer to my channel
that are like why don't you ever talk
about anything that Kylie is putting out
will you talk about Kylie cosmetics and
will a buy a video and I get tagged and
I got tagged a lot on her new collection
the weather collection so I thought that
I could include it in a will I buy a
video and maybe just kind of save my
thoughts on the brand for those of you
who might be newer around here and are
not sure yet kind of where I stand one
thing that I will say about Kylie
cosmetics is that I have purchased from
the brand in the past I was pretty
curious when the brand that did come out
but I've had several issues especially
customer service wise and it just kind
of everything what that kind of turned
me off from the brand so that's why I
decided not to be making purchases
anymore when I would have issues with
like shipping or issues when I got my
order and I would email customer service
you just got back a plain basic form
email basically saying we don't care so
don't bother us again
and I just got really frustrated with
that you know I was never the person who
like stayed up late to try to get the
collection or woke up really early to
try to get releases I don't really do
that with any makeup but it was always
kind of frustrating just how like hectic
and weird the releases were which I mean
I don't think that's on Kylie
necessarily but it just was something
that I was like it didn't make me even
want to purchase from the brand because
it was annoying trying to get items when
you would deal with websites crashing
again you were having to wait in line
and then you get kicked out of line it's
like where am i I'm sitting at home why
am i in line this is weird so that was
always frustrating I kind of feel like
things are pretty overpriced and you
know I I know it's because of her name
and who she is and that she can really
put whatever price she wants on anything
and people are still gonna buy it and
that I don't really love but I also
don't appreciate that you can't return
items or exchange items and things like
that to Kylie
medics I know not every country allows
that but in the USA a lot of brands a
lot of companies do allow returns or
exchanges or just have at least somewhat
better customer service and I just feel
like with Kylie cosmetics who she is how
much money she makes how much money that
frickin brand makes you can have better
customer service than that and there's
been a lot of issues I've seen in the
past with items that came out that like
kind if she's wrong with them and things
like that and people would speak about
them and it's just like she don't care
like I just I don't know I've always
just kind of gotten this impression from
Kylie Jenner that she does don't care
and that's that's me it's like if you
think a different way and you think
something else that's totally fine guy
generally don't care if people want to
support brands or people or whoever and
buy things that I wouldn't buy like it's
your money and you're gonna do what you
want to do I don't care I gave Kylie
cosmetics a chance I've purchased from
her in the past and just I haven't had
good experiences so instead of
supporting that I want to support brands
that I do believe in I want to support
indie brands that I think worked really
hard and that's kind of just where I
would prefer to spend my money but of
course it's my money so I get to choose
how I want to spend it the same way you
get to choose how you want to spend your
money and I would hope that you're
spending your money on brands that you
want to support and buying items that
you really want because that just makes
sense to me but that's kind of what I
think about Kylie cosmetics and really
my opinion hasn't changed I'll never say
never because I don't know there might
be a time where maybe she comes out with
something that I'm like you know what I
just really absolutely have to have that
maybe or maybe I'll see something I'm
like you know what it starting to warm
back up to Kylie J that might happen as
well but as of right now just that's
kind of where I stand with Kylie Jenner
and Kylie cosmetics but the weather
collection was inspired by her daughter
stormy so Kylie recently had a baby girl
and I guess this is the collection that
she was working on while she was
pregnant so the theme is it's called the
weather collection and the theme is very
like thunderstorms lightning and you
know I'm assuming because it all goes
along with the name stormy
it's cute to name something after her
daughter and I don't know to have that
be symbolic I think that's pretty cool
that's kind of the idea behind the name
which I think that's interesting like
some of our collections haven't really
even really caught my attention just
like either packaging wise are just like
concepts team wise and I feel like this
one actually like I think it looks cool
I like the packaging I like a lot of big
yellow on there I'm really into yellow
about this moment for whatever reason
that might be so I think that the
packaging is really cool and stuff but I
definitely feel like it's probably
geared towards pretty like specific
looks are like a specific trend type of
thing the collection I mean I mean I've
already said that I want to be
purchasing I don't support the brand but
there's three lipsticks for $18 each
there's the glitter eye duo's that are
$40 there's a shadow palettes that are
each $40 there's eye of the storm and
compa form this to calm before the storm
there's also a highlighter palette which
is $44 there's a loose highlighting
powder for $14 there's a flash gloss for
16 and a yellow cream gel liner for 14
or you can buy the entire bundle for
$280 if you so prefer and I know some
people do prefer that I did check the
Kylie cosmetics website before I sat
down to film and not everything is sold
out but the majority of the items were
sold out I can still want the website
down below in case anybody is interested
but I mean I'm not gonna go through each
item because it's just it's just not
something that I'm into at this moment
again maybe someday there will be but I
did want to address it because I've just
seen a lot of I saw a lot of tags on
this collection and I've seen a lot of
people asked like why don't you talk
about specific brands a lot of times
it's because I've talked about them in
the past and I've mentioned them several
times and mentioned it you know that I
don't support or I don't buy for this
reason or that reason and then to me
it's just kind of like why just keep
talking about it there's other brands
and other releases I would rather talk
about but because I saw all the
questions and types that just thought I
would address them in here so you can
leave me some comments below if you want
but again everybody's different
everybody reacts to someone else
differently and at the end of the day
it's we're choosing what we're going to
spend our money on makeup wise and I
would never tell someone how I think
that you should spend your money because
I think that's none of my business
that's not what the will I buy it's
therefore the will I buy it for me to
talk about will I buy it and to talk
about new releases and my thoughts on
them they're not to tell anybody else I
think you should buy this I don't think
you should buy that but those are just
kind of my thoughts on a Kylie cosmetics
in general but let us know what you
think about the weather collection so
next up we have a new release and a new
brand from a Tati Westbrook or glam Life
guru here on YouTube so Tati is a very
well-known Beauty influencer and she has
recently launched her own brand and the
first product that is coming out with
her brand her brand's name is halo
Beauty and the first item that she is
releasing is the halo Beauty HSN booster
or hair skin nail booster so it says
it's an intensely nourishing booster for
the hair skin and nails it's 39.95
you take two capsules a day you will see
results in three weeks I'm sure you guys
already know all about this so I don't
think I've ever been asked more to talk
about a product than I have these
supplements from tatuí and honestly I
kind of had seen that she was coming out
with her own brand which it seems like
every influencer is coming out with
their own brand recently so I really
didn't think too much of it and then all
of a sudden I was getting bombarded on
every single platform of what do you
think about Tottie's vitamins and I'm
like what do you mean what do I think of
Cathy's vitamins what are you talking
about I should say that I don't actually
follow talking myself I don't I
typically do not watch her videos I did
in the past like I don't even know how
long ago it was it was probably a while
ago I watched a few of her videos I
think I had heard someone like recommend
her or something like that so I watched
a couple of the videos and it's nothing
against talk to you personally I don't
dislike her I don't hate her or anything
like that I just didn't really get like
a you know like a vibe and that
okay I mean I know not everybody will
vibe with my personality I don't Bible
with some really big youtubers that
other people do I even in our group of
friendship that we have in real life I
don't live with someone who my best
friend really enjoys and vice-versa I
mean it just it is what it is so I just
don't really watch her videos that's why
I wasn't really paying too much
attention when I saw that her brain was
coming out cuz I was like yeah I mean
I'll like I'll look at it and I'll see
what it is and maybe I'll be interested
in it but because she's not someone who
like I follow and absolutely love a lot
of times when some of my favorite
influencers do collabs or they have
something exciting going out like I was
watching Katy on E the other day I was
so excited you know I get excited for
certain things like that but this one
when I was just kind of like okay and
then when I saw that she was coming out
with vitamins I was like well well I'm
not buying those because I don't really
take vitamins I don't really take
supplements that's just not something
that is in my routine so I just kind of
like washed right over it but then like
I said so many people are asking me
about it and they keep asking me about
it so I'm like oh okay like I can talk
about it and it will about video but I
don't know how exciting I'm going to be
because I don't follow Tati or feel a
certain connection with her type of
thing that kind of has me a little not
really wanting to buy them and then like
I said the biggest reason is that I
don't take vitamins or supplements every
once in a while I'll remember to take a
multivitamin and that's a few and far
between I'm just not a supplement person
it's just I don't know if I want to say
I don't believe in them but I just don't
think that they're necessary to me at
this moment sometimes if I'm having
issues with like iron deficiency which
sometimes I can if I go to the doctor
and they tell me that my iron levels are
really low
I'll pick up an iron vitamin and things
like that but other than that I feel
like I do a pretty good job with like my
diet and things like that that I feel
like I can get that without having to
take a supplement I'm not really big on
taking really any sort of pills even if
I'm sick or whatever it's just not my
thing it's just not what I'm into
but again this is such a personal thing
that I feel like it's really hard to
talk about because you're gonna offend
so I've already offended 50 of you guys
I mean
be serious I've already been offending
people and it's been really ugly to see
the community kind of react to these
vitamins and it's been really sad and it
makes it hard to talk about and I feel
like I've kind of been like kind of
dreading filming this bill I buy it
video because I know that I'm I I'm just
waiting for the comments to come in
about what a terrible person I am and
you know all these different things but
especially when you talk about vitamins
or supplements that's a very personal
thing in nature that's not just saying
hey let's put a pair of false lashes on
you or that lipstick color it looks
great on you I feel like there's a
really a lot more when it comes to
something like this product that has to
be very personal to someone by them I
feel like you definitely need to do your
research before you buy them before you
start taking them don't just listen to
me don't just listen to the next
youtuber don't just listen to Tati
you have to do your own research you
have to look at these the clinical
studies and and the feedback that has
come in and if I would say research the
ingredients I honestly I've started to
research the ingredients but this isn't
something that I want to buy for myself
I don't have an interest in this and I
don't want to recommend or not recommend
a vitamin because I don't feel educated
enough to do that I don't feel like I
have a background to do that I don't
feel like I'm warranted to do something
like that so I don't really want to get
into all those aspects I'm sure there's
plenty of other people out there that
are going to be doing it I know Jen
loves reviews who has fantastic reviews
she gets really in-depth on a lot of
those things I'll look forward I'll
watch her review but for me it's just
that's just something that's not a part
of my life another thing for me is that
I did watch takis announcement video
because once I realized like I should
put this in a will I buy a video I did
go on and watch her announcement video
and the announcement video left me
feeling very very strange I am not
really down when someone says when
someone calls a pill or a supplement
magic that was such a red flag to me
that was such a red flag to me
I really feel like if I had been
considering these for whatever reason
you know I was I don't know somewhat
interested in them and then I heard
someone say but these are a magic pill
to me that's a no to me that's that's so
to me that's just not okay to say
something like that and I mean I was
watching her video and that's really
cool what she's doing like let's not get
away from that I feel like any of these
influencers are creating their brands
anybody who creates a brand anybody who
does something like this there's
definitely a lot of time money energy
effort put into it and that can't be
taken away I'm sure that's how she did
her research I'm sure that she hired
great people I don't want to take any of
that part away from them but her launch
video just had me so very skeptical and
it had me really sad by the time I
watched the video she had already had to
disable the comments because there was
so much negativity and I don't know what
the negativity was for sure because I
haven't watched the video yet I haven't
seen the comment but it was hard hearing
her say like it's clinically proven but
then there was nothing there and I think
she has now gone on to have that and
there's information on the website but
to launch a product and to have all of
these claims but to have nowhere to back
them up on and no photos and no studies
or trials or anything it was just it was
a it was very confusing to me as a
consumer to watch that and I can
understand where people's frustrations
would have would have been I think there
probably could have been a better way to
do that launch video and to have some of
those pertinent details in there then to
have like a wedding video and there cuz
I didn't quite it just that's not
selling me on a product don't know it
was just it was very conflicting and
very confusing watching that but there
was just too many red flags for me to
say something is magic it just worries
me because I've tried supplements before
like I've I got sucked into like that
hair vitamin or whatever and I ordered
it off of octal II once and I tried
and nothing happened and you know I mean
it's going to vary from company to
company and ingredients and congruence
and all of that but like I've tried
these things in the past and nothing
actually works for me it's important to
note that it's very rare but one pill is
going to be magic to everybody who buys
it because we're all different our
genetics and our health and our needs
and everything is so very different too
so to call something that you are
selling magic I think is strange to me
and I didn't enjoy that I will say that
I did like how in the video Tati talked
about beauty from the inside which i
think is cool and I like that message
but at the same time with the vitamins
it's promoting like the hair skin and
nails and those those are all things on
the outside as well so then I wasn't
really quite sure I was understanding
what was coming from there and I think
of a problem with vitamins is that you
see a lot of like the hair vitamins like
I said I got sucked into him because I
would see so many people promoting them
i order them up actally you know you see
the hair vitamins you see like the
skinny vitamins and it kind of goes
along with like the peas and the wraps
and and all of that and it's just kind
of you kind of almost do get that scam
mentality which is sad so so I mean it
was a really interesting route to take
versus doing something makeup or
skincare but I don't know I feel like
maybe that's where people are coming
from because when I saw vitamins
honestly my first thought was kind of
like oh good another vitamin that's
promising I'm going to be beautiful like
I don't know that's just kind of what I
thought so I mean I'm sure that she uses
that like you know like she said that
she used him and she used him on and off
so she could see the results but
sometimes it's also hard especially I
know that youtubers are not necessarily
like traditional celebrities but a lot
of big-time youtubers have a lot of
money and they have a lot of other
things out their disposal and I'm I'm
not saying that taki does because I
don't know her like I said I don't watch
her videos but there's also a lot of
other outside
factors that can deal with your hair
skin and nails I know since I started
drinking at least eight glasses of water
a day my skin has looked really
phenomenal that was one of my like New
Year's resolutions was to drink as much
water as I can and when I drank all of
those glasses of water I have noticed a
difference not only with the skin on my
face I've noticed a difference in my
body as well so I don't I don't know I I
feel like sometimes promoting something
like this can have backlash and I feel
like Patti had to have known that when
she decided that this was going to be
the product that she came out but I can
understand why people are skeptical
because I'm skeptical myself I'm pretty
much got a little of all of those types
of products I just don't believe that
there's that quick fix that you know
just this vitamin is going to make you
beautiful from the inside out I feel
like there's a lot of other factors that
have to to go into that the watched
Nicki murphy's video just this morning
her her chat spot on it and she brought
up a mob mentality and I thought that
that was exactly true because how I have
felt when people have been asking me to
do this Villa by app video I feel like
people want to see like a drama channel
style video where I'm just like slamming
her and I've been seeing a lot of people
saying like she's running a scam and all
these things I truly don't feel like she
would be running a scam with this
because she has so many subscribers and
so much of a reputation to throw it all
away over like scam vitamins I think
would be very strange and I I genuinely
can't see that happening that would just
be weird to me but it has been very sad
and I feel like I'm gonna disappoint
people because I'm not mad enough and
I'm not cussing and swearing and saying
all these negative things at the same
time I'm not impressed with how her
initial video came out and some of the
things that she's said and things that
I've seen it doesn't do anything for me
and again if I would have been like on
the fence maybe thinking about buying
this I think that I honestly would have
talked myself out of it because it just
is kind of one of those things that's
like it feels like that like too good to
be true type of thing and I don't know
it's just something about it left me
with kind of an achy feeling I think
that she has a lot of balls to do a
supplement because
I think you know people were probably
expecting makeup or skincare I think
skincare is but a lot of people really
expect it from her so I think that was a
pretty ballsy move to do supplements and
I mean I kind of mean that in a good way
like nobody saw that coming I think
there's a lot of shock in that and it's
definitely got people talking but
there's also there like I said there had
to have been a ton of research and time
and money and effort and hiring the
right people to get these vitamins like
able to be sold and able to come to
fruition and whatnot like that's a
that's a pretty big thing to take on for
your first launch so I mean I feel like
there's definitely some kudos there and
I don't know if people are just mad
because they wanted an eyeshadow palette
or I don't know but there's been so much
anger around this release that I just it
honestly has made me super nervous to
film this video and I feel like I'm
going to get rambling in this section
because I don't know but regardless the
will i buy it videos are for me to talk
about a product and if I'm going to
purchase them in my thought process and
purchasing them bottom line when it
comes down to with halo beauty and these
vitamins supplements boosters whatever
you want to call them is that I don't
feel a kinship with Tati's so I
automatically don't feel that kind of
like like when I have a kinship with
someone I automatically do a double-take
on no matter what it is they're doing
are coming out with or whatever I will
always do that double take because I
feel that like friendship connection
loyalty there for whatever reason and
I'm sure a lot of you understand what it
is that I'm saying so I didn't feel that
right away couple that with the fact
that I do not take vitamins myself I do
not take supplements but this is
something that does not interest me and
not something that I would take I would
not buy them I definitely do think they
are expensive I've bought biotin in the
past because people have said that's
good for your hair nails again I didn't
feel like I really saw anything so I
kind of tapered off with them and I
can't remember the last time I purchased
biotin but I know I could get it for a
lot cheaper at drugstores I know that
Totti also made a lot of mentions in her
video that how much money that they've
put into it which was also something
that I kind of like forget me how many
times she brought up how much money
she's put into these like
I don't know that's wonderful and great
but it still is pretty pricey especially
when is she saying that you're supposed
to take two a day it's like okay you're
gonna go through that bottle pretty
quickly then
but couple of it with that that's not
part of my lifestyle is taking a vitamin
hour supplement and again that's me
personally I'm not saying that you
shouldn't if you do because that's a
very much a personal thing but for me I
do not so it wouldn't make sense for me
to purchase this hey I mean Congrats to
Tati that's a huge move to come out with
your own brand it's a huge move to come
out with the product that's really cool
I don't love the way that she went about
it I think that there was a more
professional way maybe to put out a
brand release announcement like that
I'll definitely be curious to hear
people's reviews who do have it maybe
this is magic in a jar and I just a
skeptic I don't know but I just think
maybe there was a better way to go about
it but those are kind of my thoughts
like I said I know I feel like a lot of
people are expecting me to be super
dramatic and like cussing and just like
saying the worst things about people but
that's just not who I am if you haven't
gotten that vibe from my channel yet I
don't know what to do but that's just
not really Who I am
I try to see both sides of the spectrum
but for me it's not something that
interests me and I just it just kind of
left me with a bad taste in my mouth
watching her first video so that's kind
of my thoughts on it you can leave your
thoughts down below please just you know
keep it kind in the comments especially
to other commenters I know a lot of
people have a lot of emotions about this
and for whatever reason I simply don't
have a lot of emotion about it
because it's just not something I'm
interested in I really was just gonna
pass right over it and brush right over
it but I think with so much drama that
got started with it it just kind of kept
increasing the amount of tags and the
amount of questions that I was getting
on this so that's my 14 cents on Tati's
of vitamins and what I think I'll be
passing over them but did you buy them
and you guys will have to let us know if
you did purchase them what you think and
if you've seen any improvements but yeah
other than that that's gonna do it for
this week's bullabbai video if that is
everything for this week's vilifying
video as always I hope you found this
video helpful or entertaining in some
way leave your comments down below
and everything of that I've mentioned
I'll be very interested to read some of
these comments this week and as always
let me know what you want to see
