today's video is going to be another
will quiet video I am seriously so
thrilled like you guys are loving my
will i5 idios because honestly it's
giving me content to put out talking
about new releases without feeling the
pressure of having to go out and buy
every single new products because I
can't afford that so I really appreciate
that you guys like these type of videos
where I'm almost like reviewing the
products without having them letting you
guys know if I'm going to spend my money
on them and if I think it's worth it and
all that sort of thing like that makes
me so happy that you guys really like
these videos my neighbors walking by and
giving me a weird look so so thank you
guys so much for the support on my will
i buy it videos these have become some
of my most popular videos here on
youtube and i've only done like two or
three or something like that so thank
you so much really excited that you guys
are liking these I did mention in my
last will i buy it video that I would be
doing more on the holiday collections
that are coming out so in-betweens like
the will I buy it and my aunt I haul
videos I'm going to try to cover it as
much of the holiday releases that I can
and I also asked you guys you know what
out of all of the holiday madness craze
would you want to see me talk about in
my will I buy it and the majority vote
was on Too Faced so the majority of this
video is going to be focused on Too
Faced and what they are putting out for
the 2016 holidays
not all Too Faced but like I said the
majority will be on Too Faced
I will break down each product to let
you know about it the price if I think
I'm gonna buy it what I think the pros
and cons are what I think of the reviews
so far that I have seen so I'm really
excited about it I also do want to let
you guys know make sure you stay tuned
until the end because I will be doing a
giveaway announcement at the end I'm
really excited for this giveaway it's
gonna be a little bit different from
what I've been doing with my giveaways
so make sure you stay tuned until the
end because exciting giveaway news is
coming but I want to go ahead and happen
to our first product ok so the first one
that I want to talk about is from
hourglass and it is their new ambient
lighting
edit surreal light palettes
okay so this is from hourglass this was
actually really requested when I did my
last minute video I had it on my list to
talk about but I didn't get the time to
be able to include it so I wanted to
make sure to include it in this video
because a lot of people have asked
questions about this one and I get it
because it's an $80 palette that's
expensive so from the Sephora website it
says this is a limited-edition palette
of universally flattering powder bronzer
blushes and a covetable highlighter all
for the holiday season so it looks like
you get five different pans with blushes
highlighters bronzers all very glowy all
very shimmery to that sort of effect now
I do not own anything from hourglass I
know that they're you know highlighting
pellets have been talked about a lot to
be honest with you what I've seen about
the hourglass lighting palettes or
whatever they are called
I really have not seen a lot of great
and views on them I've watched a lot of
use on YouTube where people said I'm
taking this back because you know
hourglass is a high-end brand this is
more expensive like I mentioned this
palette is $80 which i think is very
pricey on the website the I'm on the
Sephora website and on the website it
looks like they're decent size pans but
I've seen like real life pictures of
this palette and the pans actually
looked to be very small and when reading
the reviews a lot of people are saying
you know this is like a very small
palette for $80 like the pan so I should
be bigger also reading through the
reviews they are not good a lot of
people are saying these are too sheer
they're barely showing up and you know
honestly I am NOT going to buy this
palette I knew right off the bat that I
was not gonna buy this palette because
just from everything that I've heard
about these hourglass you know what type
of highlighters I haven't heard great
things in the past I haven't heard great
things about this palette already and
it's $80 like I just can't make that
justification for a pellet that's
probably not even gonna work on my skin
tone and that the reviews are just not
doing too well I also let you guys know
that I don't
love purchasing limited edition items I
do it of course because you know
sometimes they're just limited edition
products that I really want but I try
not to use limited edition a ton because
it makes it harder when I do tutorials
and such and you know the products
already not for sale anymore and I'm
trying to do tutorials with them it just
doesn't seem very fair so all those
reasons combined I will not be
purchasing the hourglass Holliday
palette but if any of you like already
own it cuz I know this isn't a super
super new release but if any of you guys
already on it please do leave what you
think of it and the comments down below
let us know if you think it's good or
not okay so now jumping into to face
that the first product that I want to
talk about is the Too Faced grand hotel
cafe this is a pretty unique set and it
features 18 eyes shadows two blushes a
bronzer and a mascara and it's kind of
broken down into three like separate
palettes on the inside but it's three
holiday coffee sentient palettes that
smell like peppermint mocha Gingerbread
coffee and eggnog okay then so this set
is a $49 and it is limited edition as
well of course as with most holiday
collections are so this one I also
decided that I will not be purchasing it
honestly I don't know if I need all of
those different eyeshadows I'm not like
an eyeshadow junkie I usually prefer to
spend my money on something else
makeup wise but you know the eyeshadows
I don't feel like I need that money but
I have watched quite a few haul videos
and swatch videos of the Grand Hotel
cafe most recently I watched I think
it's Danielle XO Danielle Rey on YouTube
I watched her swatch a video of this and
I was so completely underwhelmed by what
I saw and so was she in the video and
you know just the swatches were not
showing up they were not showing
pigmented this is one when looking at
the reviews they seem pretty mixed some
people say it's great some people are
saying you know it's a dud based on that
you know I don't feel like I need all
these eyeshadows a lot of the swatch
videos that I have seen they don't love
to be great $49
I don't feel like that's a bad price for
all that you're getting and you know
it's a cute setup it's cute cute little
package that you're getting it all in
but for me I didn't think it was worth
it and just personally I have yet to see
a swatch video on this with great
swatches I do you know I see the reviews
on Sephora that people are saying
there's our pigmented and beautiful but
in person I have yet to see a video
showing fantastic swatches I'm not going
to purchase the Too Faced grande hotel
cafe I'm going to talk about the
chocolate shop set now the chocolate
shop said it says it's a makeup set with
cocoa powder and fused products from 21
I shadow to blush and lipstick I see
that you also get the Too Faced shadow
insurance as well in here so yeah I
think you get minutes of the shadow
insurance the better than sex mascara
and then the mini lipstick that you get
is in milkshake which I believe it's
like a cocoa brown color so the set is
running for $58 and one thing that I
want to touch on too when it comes to
the holiday collections because you know
spoiler alert if you can't tell there's
a lot that I'm not gonna purchased and a
lot of that reason you know not only it
being limited edition and I try my best
to stay away as much as I can from
limited edition but also a lot of times
I have heard that the companies will not
manufacture the holiday sets at the same
places that they normally do so when you
buy a set like for example if you buy
you know something from Too Faced and
you are expecting the same quality as
like their chocolate bar palette a lot
of times they are not the same because
they are going to a different
manufacturer I don't know why that is I
know I'm not saying that every single
company does it but I hear it a lot when
it comes to the holiday collections is
that you know especially when it comes
to eye shadows or blushes you know the
powder type of things that they're just
not the same as what you would normally
expect from my company so again that's
another reason because I feel like you
know you're still paying a lot of money
for these sets but they aren't the same
quality so you know that's a lot that
I'm hearing from to Phase two because
they're coming out with these
shout out palettes and people just don't
seem to be super impressed and I've seen
a lot of the reviews you know this is
not the same quality it's not the same
quality so again with the chocolate shop
palette I'm not gonna purchase this one
I already touched on limited edition I
already touched on I'm not a huge I
shadow junkie I do like that this one
comes with even though there are many is
that it comes with the shadow insurance
because I think the Too Faced shadow
insurance is really good the Too Faced
better than sex mascara is one of my
favorite mascaras hands-down and for me
I personally don't love the Too Faced
melted lipsticks I've talked about it
before on my channel but I think they
bleed outside the lips too much but it
seems like a lot of other people really
do enjoy the Too Faced melted lipsticks
and the milkshake one is actually one
that I thought about purchasing when
they came out with their line of like
nudes and browns I can't think of what
they called it maybe like the chocolate
melted collection I don't remember but
when they came out with that milkshake
was actually on my list and I talked
myself out of getting it just because I
don't love those lipsticks but I know a
lot of people do and milkshake was a
very popular color so I like that it
comes with those I think I actually
would probably like this palette over
the Grand Hotel cafe I think I would
actually gravitate more towards this one
like if you made me purchase one of
these palettes I would probably go for
this one it just seems more of my Ally
for $58 I'm not gonna be biting on this
one palette that Too Faced is releasing
around the holiday collection is called
Mary macaroons this is a 12 I shadow
palette and then it also comes with a
deluxe size of the better than sex
mascara and this one is $39 I don't want
all of those other eyeshadows you know
you maybe you just want one of the sets
and you want to save a couple of dollars
this one would be a good option for you
again I like the Too Faced better than
sex mascara is this one that I will
purchase for myself no mostly because
the reasons that I have already
mentioned but you might want to stick
around because I might have bought this
one just not for me
so moving away from a shadows keeping on
with Too Faced another set that they
released is called Merry Christmas
this one has three melted minis I
believe they're deluxe size of the
melted lipsticks and then one mini of
the melted matte lipstick so the deluxe
size for the melted lipsticks the shades
are in Chihuahua fig and honey so
Chihuahua is like a spiced nude I have
it it is a really nice nude fig I also
have it's more of like a plum purple
type of shade and then honey is one of
the melted chocolate and it is a warm
caramel and then the melted matt is in
lady balls which is a matte true red
lady balls so this entire set runs for
twenty-five dollars honestly out of
everything that two-face has put out for
their holiday scent this is the one that
spoke to me the most maybe if there was
a few different shades in there I might
have actually purchased this one I don't
mind getting deluxe minis for lipsticks
because it's so hard to go through a
lipstick anyway that I don't mind saving
a couple dollars and getting minis but I
already have Chihuahua and I already
have fig lady boss doesn't really excite
me because of it being red I understand
red for the holiday season
totally not mad at that but red isn't
something that I gravitate towards very
often I actually haven't tried the Too
Faced melted bats so I would have really
have like to try one with already having
two of the melted lipsticks and then not
being super excited about the matte
color that's the reason that I'm not
gonna buy it but honestly if the shades
were a little bit different or if I
didn't already have those I probably
would have purchased this one because I
think it's a really good price again
only $25 this one I think looks like a
really good value and again stay tuned
to the end because even though either
wouldn't necessarily benefit from this
set maybe one of you will and maybe you
could win it last item that I want to
talk about from Too Faced is their
knotty kisses and sweet cheeks this one
caught my eye as well because inside you
are getting free of their love lush
blushes and then also three of the lip
injections so both of these I believe
are deluxe sizes I have heard a lot
about the low flush blushes from
to face just how nice they are everyone
seems to love them to be honest I'm not
a huge blush person like I'm slowly I'm
slowly getting there slowly but I just
have never gone through and purchased
them myself because they are pretty
expensive individually and just like you
know not being a huge blush person I've
been like I will buy a lipstick instead
or a foundation or a highlighter so I
haven't purchased them myself but I hear
really really great things about them
I've also never tried the lip injections
either but they're supposed to be I
believe they come in like a gloss type
of form and they do have different
shades to them but for the lip
injections it comes in original
milkshake and like a boss and then the
love flush comes in crazy in love baby
love and dream lover so like I was
saying about the gloss injections I
haven't tried them myself but they do
come you know with a shade or pigmented
or the original but they are supposed to
basically help make your lips look a
little fuller in a little plumper now
back in the day I used to work with Too
Faced like back when they first came out
way back in the day when I just had my
blog I actually tested out a lot of
products for Too Faced and wrote reviews
for them which was really cool but back
in the day they had a lip injection and
I don't know if they still have this
product or not but it was just something
that you would put on your lips before
you put lipstick on like there was no
shade or pigmentation to it and honestly
that hurts like I remember making people
try it even like guys I was like no
seriously I just put this on because
your lips will hurt so bad it tingles so
much it was crazy so I don't know if
these lip injections are similar to that
if they still have the same formula I
don't know because seriously that was
like five or six years ago that I was
doing that but I believe that the
two-faced lip injections probably will
work just from what I've based on the
past and what I've tried from them but
I've never tried these so this set
caught my eye as well simply because
I've wanted to try out the blushes and I
would be totally down for trying out
these lip injections the total for the
set is $36 but even though it does
interest me
I decided I'm not gonna buy it it's $36
which I don't think is a terrible price
but really I think I really only would
want like one blush and like one lips
lip injection from it and I really I
thought about buying edging like
stocking stuffers for other people but
have a ton of other makeup lovers in my
life and for the people that are in my
lips that are makeup lovers I already
have other gift ideas for them so I just
wasn't sure that I would use all of them
but honestly I think this one is a
really good value as well you know once
we get toward the holiday season as well
I do try to pay more attention to where
my money is going because I have so many
different gifts to buy I leave like nine
nieces and nephews which is crazy and
then siblings and parents and spouses
and you can't forget my dog so you know
I have around the holiday time is
usually when we see people tighten their
belts as well and start to be a little
bit more conservative with their money
usually I mean the beauty community this
will be my first like holiday season
within the beauty community and I'm real
curious about it because so far people
are just like holidays and I feel like
I'm the only one over here like oh
that's why I've decided not to purchase
this one but honestly if you're looking
for a good set this one looks really
good too or the kiss miss those two sets
really caught my eye from two-face for
the will I buy it and I know you guys
might be thinking like well that was a
bar because I'm not actually going to
purchase anything the kiss miss said I'm
telling you guys if it just had
different shades I totally would have
purchased that for sure but I still want
to talk about everything in here give
you my reasons but also I decided not to
purchase some of the things like the
final set that I talked about because I
actually did buy it just not for me I am
putting together a giveaway for my
Instagram not done an Instagram giveaway
it since my 5k giveaway on Instagram and
we recently have hit the 12,000 mark on
Instagram which really excites me I had
actually planned to do a 10k giveaway on
Instagram but 10k we achieved it and
then we surpassed it within a couple of
hours and it was really really really
crazy and before I even had
to plan anything out or decide what I
was doing we had already come and gone
from the 10k mark now we're at 12,000
which excites me so much I knew I wanted
to put together some sort of giveaway
for my Instagram so I'm excited to
announce it here I wanted to let you
guys know because I'm featuring a lot of
the products that I mentioned in this
video so I really want you guys to hop
over to my Instagram to make sure that
you get entered so for the giveaway I'm
giving away all from Too Faced the Mary
macaroon set so that had the 12 I've
shadows and the Too Faced better than
sex mascara I'm giving away the Merry
Christmas with the 3 melted minis and
the 1 melted matte mini I'm also giving
away the naughty kisses and sweet cheeks
set so I'm really excited to give that
one away so I've been very curious about
that and I'm also gonna give away a
deluxe size of the Too Faced better than
sex mascara and it comes in like an
ornament I saw that to face for putting
those out as well I think they have oh
they have like two other ones it might
have been like the Too Faced mascara
that they have and maybe a lip injection
that they have in like an ornament form
which I thought would be cute for a
stocking stuffer as well but since we're
doing a giveaway I thought I'd throw
that one in there as well just cuz I
thought it was really cute both for
items from Too Faced from their holiday
collections are up for grabs over on my
Instagram so this is an Instagram
