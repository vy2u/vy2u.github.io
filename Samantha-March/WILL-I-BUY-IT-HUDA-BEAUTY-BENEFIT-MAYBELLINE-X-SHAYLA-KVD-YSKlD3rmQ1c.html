today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will I buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them like I said I post these every
single Wednesday and I do have a will I
buy a playlist that I will leave a link
down below in case you want to catch up
on any of my past will i buy videos in
addition to my Wednesday videos I am
doing a daily uploads right now which is
a lot of fun so if you're interested in
getting a daily content on makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button before you
go but as always with my will I bite
videos I have a lot to talk about
so what we go ahead and get started I
got quite a few questions on some new
releases from Kat Von D Beauty Kat Von D
oh sure coming out with a lot of new
things right now I've talked about a
couple of them in the past like her
glimmer eyes shadow College which is
also coming out with the everlasting
glimmer veil lipsticks I think is what
they're called it just has a relaxing
glimmer veil they're a lip product
though I mean I'll have the photos in
here they're they're a lip product a
lipstick they're $22 each will be
available starting August 22nd I'm
looking at the trend mid one Instagram I
typically read from her Instagram so I
have her link in the description box
down below and she's got some really
good swatch photos on there too it looks
like there's going to be nine different
shades and you can either wear these
alone or you can wear them over a
lipstick they're kind of like that
glittery lip stopper type of feeling is
what I'm getting when I'm looking at the
swatches so I'm not going to be getting
these but I mean they look cool the
swatches look fun and all of that but I
just don't do like the glitter shimmer
lips I don't do the metallic lips it's
just not really my thing it's fun for me
every once in a while to go outside my
comfort zone but I have glitter lips I
have metallic lips and you know when
it's something that I don't reach for on
any sort of consistent basis did it help
slow my video last week too why is there
another fly in my house when I'm not
reaching for something on a consistent
basis it's just kind of I don't want to
say silly to spend my money on but in my
eyes for me personally because I know
how much makeup I buy and I know how a
little storage I have for all of my
makeup in
my eyes is silly for me to purchase
something that I know I won't get a lot
of use out of $22 doesn't seem like a
bad price but again it's you know how
often are you going to where I look like
this this might be totally your vibe and
you might rock the style on a daily
basis and the $22 obviously it's going
to make a lot more sense for you but
someone like me it's just not my
personal make up vibe it just wouldn't
make sense for me to go ahead and
purchase it or these everlasting glimmer
veil ellipse ticks I'm going to go ahead
and pass over them install items I'm
going to talk about our influencer
collaborations the first one that I was
getting a lot of questions on was the
new collaboration between makeup Shayla
and Maybelline I was pretty intrigued
when I saw this collaboration honestly
because Maybelline is one of those
brands that has been around forever you
know this was a brand that my mom used
and that I would you know sneak her
makeup when I was in junior high in high
school and so there is kind of one of
like the staples in the beauty community
you know I know a lot of people get
frustrated with like the viral brands
and Instagram brand they say like the
you know kind of rely on the influencer
collaborations to really keep them going
and to really keep the hyper Onam but
Maybelline is not that way I thought it
was intriguing to see them collab with
makeup Shayla no more like the
Maybelline covergirl like you know I
feel like it's definitely trending
towards more influenced or
collaborations or having influencers see
the smoke the spill fondles for them
things like that I mean I was at my
target the other day and I thought I
love Sarah II her face in the next
section so you know it's definitely
super interesting to see and it's kind
of a fun direction to go in and so I was
very interested when I saw Maybelline
doing a collab with makeup Shayla I'm
fairly new to following makeup Shayla I
kind of watched her more on like desi
and Katy's snapchat and I don't feel
like we have a real blog because
sometimes I just like she looks as well
a little bit too seriously that's kind
of hard for me to watch influencers like
that I've kind of been trying to keep
more with the people who I just find
more relatable to me personally and just
sometimes it's just a little a little
bit too overboard for me but I do still
walk around snapchat man subscribe to
her youtube I watch her videos and all
of that but I just I don't feel like a
pull for her like I do someone like desi
and Katy who you know I bought their
dose of colors collapse items that I
wanted from their collaboration with
those I've you know bought those right
away so a lot of very interested in
seeing the collaboration I can't say
that I've got like an immediate like yes
I'm so excited I'm going to buy all of
these products but I just think is very
interesting and a huge congratulations
to makeup Shayla because that's just
freaking awesome I mean it just ripped
just really is it's super awesome to see
that so her collaboration with
Maybelline was the city mini palette
it's the makeup Shayla city mini palette
oh and one of the palettes in a rooftop
bronze I did get it sent to me from
influencer to review and then she also
came out with three bigshot mascaras so
these are not you neither product is
like new new to Maybelline the city
minis there's already a full line of
them and then the Big Shot mascara was
really high job last year I know makeup
Shayla and Manny anyway I think was the
other one who was doing a lot of promo
work for that but she came out with like
her own three special colors which are
popping purple badass black and bloomin
in blue so the eyeshadow palette is
$9.99 and then the mascaras were each
849 so they'd be available August 11th
online I'll to view the August 10th and
then they will be available in stores I
not like I said I fell on makeup Shayla
on snapchat of all Maybelline on
snapchat so I saw like the release party
for it and I heard that the palette sold
out that night and then looking on the
auto website it is out of stock there
but they're supposed to be coming back I
believe she listed on her snapchat that
I would be coming back in September and
we did say some stores might already
have it available but if I have any more
like specific dates or information for
the tens of videos up I will have that a
link down below I shadow palette does
look really pretty I definitely thought
Shayla vibes when I thought there's a
really pretty deep purple in there a lot
of nice gold too like my city mini
palette from Maybelline I thought it was
good especially for the price at the
$9.99 for a drugstore palette I didn't
think it was bad at all it wasn't like a
favorite of mine but I did think it was
pretty good but because I already have
that one and Quebec so many eyeshadow
palettes and because I don't feel like a
friendship with a makeup Shayla I just
didn't feel the need or the pull to get
it right now I'm buying so much makeup
right now guys it's crazy I'm really
trying
be very selective on what it is that I
am buying so I just didn't feel like I
needed it and then with the mascaras I
haven't tried the Big Shot mascara I
heard a lot of really good things about
it when it did launch but I also wear
false lashes like I would say 85% of the
time even on days I'm not filming now on
social media I just prefer to wear false
lashes I have for a very long time so I
don't buy a ton of mascara because I
just don't reach for it a lot and my
scarib real assess so there's not really
a huge point for me to buy a ton of
mascaras so I just didn't feel like I
really needed anything from the
collection and nothing really like both
to me or made me do a double-take but
I'd love to know your guys thoughts on
what you thought about the collaboration
between makeup Shayla and Maybelline do
you want to see more of some of these
like older brands getting more into the
you know influence and marketing and
social media and all of that I would
love to know your thoughts down below
and also if you grab anything from this
collaboration the next up I have another
influencer collaboration to talk about
and I thought this one was really
interesting I saw it and I really gave
no thought to putting it in a will I
bias to be honest and I got so many
questions about it like so many people
wanted to see me talk about it in this
video that I was like okay it just kind
of caught me off guard because I I don't
know it just kind of caught me off guard
to be honest well what a lot of people
are saying on my snapchat and also like
my Instagram DMS a lot of people said to
me I think I know what you're going to
say but I want to hear you talk about
this and I thought that was very
intriguing so I think maybe I know what
people are saying but I don't know why
I'm just I'm going to just go ahead and
give you my thoughts and what I think
about this you can tell me if you were
right so Benefit Cosmetics did a
collaboration with not just one youtuber
but five a beauty youtuber is beauty
influencers and they came out with the
beauty style way collection okay it is
available now it is a support exclusive
I checked the force or filming it was so
available at Sephora so I will leave it
down below so basically they change up
these five influencers and each
influencer has like their favorite
benefit product and then they are all in
this kit I believe that you can only buy
it as the kit
not individually so from I love Sara II
she has the Porefessional primer Jeffrey
stars of roller lash mascara mani
emulate the hoola bronzer Laura Lee
precisely my brow pencil in shade number
three so you only get shade three
I'm Nicole Guerrero at the gimme brow
gel yeah I'll find items and they are
many items apparently so like I would
say like deluxe eye sample sizes
probably and it's $32 for all five I
guess that's a support exclusive it is
available I'll have it linked down below
and and okay so that is that so it's all
benefit on snapchat so I saw them I
can't remember where they went maybe
like Vegas can't remember for sure but
they were somewhere doing the launch of
this and my first thought was why I I
don't I don't know and I don't know why
this particular collaboration and gave
me so many feelings in a bad way but it
just really did I think a lot when you
hear collaborations a lot of people get
very concerned that influencers are only
putting their name and their face on
something and not actually being
involved in the process and not actually
being involved at all like it's just
they're just getting paid for their name
and face and I mean that's the same one
with the influencers I know a lot of
people think that about the liveries as
well like your more traditional
celebrities Elevens when you hear
influencers talking about their
collaborations with brands I feel like a
lot of them are really pointing out the
fact like I did that I was involved with
this part I was involved in this I was
involved in the design I was involved in
the packaging I was involved in the
formulation like I was involved so when
you see this you know that they weren't
involved because these are all products
that benefit already has out there you
can already buy these so obviously they
didn't really have a part in the coming
up with the product or deciding what to
name it or deciding anything like that
like it's just their name on a box so I
don't know I I feel like that was the
first thing that kind of just like
rubbed me the wrong way I was like I
don't get it and then even when I was
watching the benefit snapchat they
hadn't even seen their packaging but if
it was like we're going to surprise them
and show them for the first time what
their packaging looks like they didn't
even approve the packaging they had no
part in this they like just
favorite product and put their name on
it I don't get it I'm like I've not not
understanding I guess that's why I
appreciate like the Katy desi dose of
colors collaboration because you got to
see it's like there was no games that
they're playing no games like when you
said that like when they said they were
working for two years on it you
literally thought in that video you saw
Katy's different hair colors so you know
how many years they worked on that and
you saw them and you saw their freaking
husbands making the models of lipsticks
and how the different designs of it like
you know that they put everything into
it you know they named their own shades
that they had everything to do with that
collaboration and that's what we want to
see we don't want to just see people
putting their names and faces on
products just to sell them and I
honestly just made me really disappoint
it and benefit that you know you
couldn't come you couldn't come up with
a different idea like you you couldn't
come up with it you just had to grab
five really high-profile influencers and
slap their name on a product to make
some money and I'm sorry like I'm not
usually the person that gets very Randy
I don't think I don't think I'm the
person that gets very ranky or like
really judgmental about things but this
just rubbed me the wrong way in like
literally every single way which was
really quite the bummer for me because I
like benefit and but recently they are
doing some things and I'm kind of like
I'm not understanding the direction that
you are going and this is just another
one that I'm like I just don't
understand the vision that you're going
I really love Nicole Guerrera I just
mentioned her and B you know beauty
channels that I watch and love I
mentioned a colder era I really do like
I love Sarah II I bought some of her
collaboration that she did was color pop
I know she'd you new to YouTube but I've
been watching all of her videos and I
really do enjoy her I think a lot of you
will probably know my thoughts on
Jeffery star I've talked about him and
Jerry star cosmetics a lot in the past I
don't support and with me anyway I don't
support Laura Lee I tried really hard to
be on her bandwagon for a long time and
I finally just had to unsubscribe
because I just couldn't do it anymore I
just couldn't so I mean two out of five
obviously I'm not going to buy the
collaboration and I talked about the
collaborations that I do decide to buy
it's from people that I really do trust
and I trust that they put that time and
their energy into it and they're all
into it and they're super proud of it
proud to have their name on it and this
one I just I guess I just don't feel
those vibes but it definitely could be
just because I don't support three out
of the five but I really want to open up
this discussion queue guys as long as
the comments you know that I read and
respond to all of my comments and I want
to hear what you say because I don't
know if I'm just like if I'm the only
person that thinks this way or anybody
else was maybe thought of that or that
doesn't matter Q you know you still
believe that these are their favourite
products and they really want to do what
they can to support them I just I don't
have a conversation I'd love to hear
what people have to say but I think a
lot of people maybe knew what I was
going to say because of the comments
that were coming in when you were asking
me if I was going to buy it it was super
super interesting to read the like I
just want to hear your thoughts type of
comments and those are my thoughts and
you know I'm not going to buy it
obviously I'm not going to buy it thirty
two dollars for five minutes I don't
even know what I feel about that is
something that I don't feel like
supporting at this time and I'm just not
I'm just really wasn't down with it I
just I just really wasn't down with it
at all but I don't know that's like even
to go back to the makeup Shayla
Maybelline like I don't really get the
mascara part because I'm not scare was
right out there like at least with a
city mini palette I feel like she at
least had some part of the color
selection process and you know I'm not
behind the scenes so I don't know what
these influencers did but we see nothing
we just see them getting surprised for
the first time on snapchat what's the
freaking product they don't even know
what it looks like it like it just I
don't know it just doesn't really make
any sense I mean I just kind of left me
with a bad taste in my mouth stuff and
that's what I think about the benefits
and a beauty influencer so a
collaboration but let me know your
thoughts because I really really really
want to hear that Matt on this one I
Alessa
this is the multi-cut set for this week
of course look a ways this is the new
huda beauty eyeshadow palette this is
the desert dust palette it has 18 shades
of four different textures matte soils
glittery and sheer and it is going to be
available September 18th alright so who
do Beauty usually her products come
first on the food of beauty website and
then they typically also launched in
Sephora and usually on in stores as well
her first eyeshadow palette I want to
say was in the $60 range like $65 you
don't see a price yet on this
it's going to be around at that exact
same price I will have the photo in here
it looks gorgeous it looks like that
classic warm tone palette that we're
getting right now lots of warm shades
these beautiful glittery shades do look
very very enticing but to be honest I
really don't have a lot of interest in
this one the first coat of Beauty
eyeshadow palette didn't really catch my
attention up like she does I don't want
it should I get it I don't know what to
do I waited I waited for the reviews to
come and watch more reviews on first
eyeshadow palette I thought it was
extremely mixed but I thought it was
kind of more on the negative side a lot
of people didn't love it they said it
was very very hard to work with which is
kind of funny now it's a subculture
palette and still so many people could
have good things to say about who -
beauty even though it's hard to work
with but the subculture fell it's hard
to work with I have it on my eyes today
and everybody chose that palette apart
but I digress so just knowing that I
just I just can't get excited for it I
just felt like what people were saying
and what they thought of the palette and
how you you have to use so many of the
shades with your fingers like not a lot
of them work well with brushes I haven't
painted my nails yet um so you can't
really use brushes with the palette if
you use a lot of your fingers I clearly
have acrylics on just going to fill
today I haven't had time to paint them
yet but I have acrylics on I don't want
to be digging my fingers into eyeshadow
palettes that's not enjoyable for me I
want to use my brushes I have a friggin
1 million brushes I want to use them
because I love my brushes so much so
just things like that just made me not
want to do it I heard really bad things
about the packaging like you're paying
$65 and people are saying it was like
super flimsy palette I don't think it
comes with a mirror I don't think the
first one did No maybe does it does the
picture looks like it has a mirror so so
at least there's a mirror but it just
doesn't it doesn't really do anything
for me and because based on the first
reviews I just really don't have a lot
of interest in this one and a lot of
people are already making comparisons
shade wise - this one - the color brain
Queen of Hearts eyeshadow palette which
I want to get when it does restock and
comes back as a permanent item which is
very very soon I'm pretty sure it's not
already so I want to get that palette
and I have seen the comparison
side-by-side they do look extremely
extremely similar of course you know
it's an eyeshadow palette we probably
have similar shades and stuff anyway so
it does just look a very very difficult
Queen of Hearts palette and
five dollars for an eyeshadow palette
like I struggle paying like 49 like I
struggle with that struggle really hard
so in the 60s when we started getting up
there that's that's really hard for me
to do I love makeup I spend a lot of
money on makeup but that's kind of like
you're really pushing my limit and I'm
going to have to hear phenomenal reviews
on this one in order for me to bite the
bullet like I'm just I'm just going to
have to hear amazing forking seconds on
this palette for me to bite the bullet
but I'm just not going to do it I don't
have a lot of interest in it and a lot
of it is based on that first eyeshadow
palette but again the price is just way
to up there for me and if it's like the
first one where I have to mostly use my
fingers in order to get that color
payoff in order to get that glitter
shimmer color to come alive it's just
not going to work for me and I'm not
going to want to do it had a lot from
Hooda Beauty I really do like that brand
I love her lashes I especially love her
liquid lipsticks I love them so much I
say she's got a lot more items that are
be coming out recently I'm excited to
try some of those but for some reason
that eyeshadow pellets just they just
don't give me a strong pull so I'm going
to go ahead and pass over the new huda
beauty eyeshadow palette when it
releases in September and then after
that that's going to do it for this
week's will I buy a video okay so then
everything for this week so will I buy a
video I really hope that you guys
