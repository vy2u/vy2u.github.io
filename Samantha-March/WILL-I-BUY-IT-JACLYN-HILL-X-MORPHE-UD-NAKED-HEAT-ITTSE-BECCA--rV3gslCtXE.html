so today's video is going to be a new
will I buy it I plus my about videos
every single Wednesday where I am
talking about some new makeup releases
and lunches letting you know a little
bit about them and also letting you know
if I'm going to pick them up or if I'm
going to pass over them I started it as
a spin-off to the anti haul which was
created by Kimberly Clark I'll have her
channel listed down below I was starting
to do anti hauls and then I thought you
know what I just want to put my own spin
on them so I started the wilayat series
as a way to be able to talk about new
releases when I was starting out as
basically getting no PR I do get a few
packages here here in there now which is
super super exciting I just started as a
way to still be able to talk about the
new releases without feeling the need to
buy all of them because I'm simply not
in the position to be able to go out and
buy everything release and then another
reason I started it I took inspiration
from the anti-natal and the idea behind
the anti haul that Kimberly Clark had in
mind
and again just want to put my own spin
on it of talking through makeup
purchases because a lot of times with
makeup I'm totally there
you know something releases we're so
excited about it there's a ton of hype I
just go ahead and buy it and then I get
it I think I didn't actually need that I
just wanted to slow down the buying
process think about it think it through
think if I needed I have to say from
doing the will I biased I have
definitely been able to talk myself out
of a lot of products that I might have
just went ahead and purchased anyways
and I know a lot of you guys say that
same thing so it makes me really happy
and that the will I buy it has made you
slow down and think things through and
that just makes me so happy those
comments mean so much to me so I thought
I would do a quick explanation of the
will advice series I was having a chat
with a subscriber in last week's video I
think it was and she was kind of saying
she thought this was going to be a
review video saying that the way about
videos are not meant to be reviewed type
of videos at all they're meant to be
more of talking through the shopping
process of seeing someone else's
thoughts when it comes to buying makeup
because I find it interesting I find all
of your guys's comments interesting and
just a reminder that we don't need to
buy all of the makeup out there and let
only buy the things that we truly truly
want or that we actually do need for our
collections so I'm really grateful that
you guys have been loved
the willing right series so much I do
have a playlist so I will leave that
link down below in addition to my
Wednesday will I bias I post on
Thursdays Sundays and Mondays so I hope
that you will subscribe so you can get
notified for my future videos and
without further ado now why don't we go
ahead and jump into this week's will I
buy it so I was getting some tags on
some new releases from Becca cosmetics
so Becca cosmetics is coming out with
new light chaser highlighters and also
liquid crystal glosses i believe these
both are going to be limited edition so
there are several shades for the
highlighters and then also the lip
products as well I will have some photos
insert it in here but like I normally do
I will also leave the trend moon
Instagram listed down below as well
because a lot of times I'm giving
information from her Instagram page so
in my will I advise every week I do also
list a trend mood Instagram page so it
says these are online at Sephora they
are available now so I will have them
linked down below as long as they are
not sold out and say right off the bat
I'm not going to get the lip glosses
because they are very like holographic
type looking lip glosses and I'm just
not into that I know that is what its
super on-trend right now like I
understand how the graphic is on trend
mermaids and unicorns and all that and
it's just not really a trend for me
they're just not super my style like
what I would do on a daily basis or even
like somewhat regular basis is just for
like if I want to do something really
outside my comfort zone for fun then I
could hit that kind of trend up but for
me to like pad my collection with stuff
that I just know I'm not going to get a
ton of use out of it's just not a very
smart purchase again that's what the
series is all about trying to make the
best smartest purchases that we can when
it comes to makeup so I just know for
the lip glosses they are just totally
not going to be for me the highlighters
they do look really beautiful but I've
been saying in my past Olivia videos
that my makeup collection is like
overflowing with highlighters I have so
many I do not need any more I've been
trying to put myself on a highlight no
bi love that highlights and I think they
are so pretty
but I definitely don't need another one
at this time especially in comparison to
the rest of my makeup collection so they
look really pretty but again I'm reading
that it's limited edition so I just
love limited-edition either if it's not
something that I truly need and from a
tradition I'm not even going to bother
like trying to talk myself into it so
I'm not going to get these new releases
from button cosmetics the highlights do
look super pretty lip gloss is totally
not for me the highlights look very
pretty and I like that they come in a
variety of different shades for
different skin tones are what you look
for in your highlights but I just don't
need them I don't see the prices in this
post right off the bat so I'll have
those in the description box down below
as I do post everything and link
everything in the description box
everything that I'm talking about will
be linked and usually I'll link all of
my makeup in there as well in case you
are ever curious what is on my face that
has all that in the description box so
make sure you check it out but I'm
passing over these new releases from
Becca cosmetics those down in the
comments what you are getting have you
already picked up something from the new
lip glosses and highlighters where
you're super excited about it or were
you kind of like me and it just wasn't a
collection for you let us know in the
comments I also got a few tags on a
collaboration between itse beauty and
love for lacquer so love for lacquer I
believe is a youtuber did a
collaboration with it see beauty and
that's IP TSE I remember the first time
I ever heard of it see I've got people
who are saying it see like the FC bag
and I was getting very confused but
there they are - super brand so the
collaboration that came out includes
three highlighters and then also one
blush it's $35 for the quad or you can
spend $50 to get the bundle and it
includes a palette like a magnetic
palette to put them in so right off the
bat like I love the packaging it looks
beautiful this kind of like coral and
gold I think it looks really pretty I
was seeing quite a few of my friends on
snapchat they did get it in PR and so I
was looking at the shades and I was
looking up the swatches and I thought
everything looked really beautiful and
was swatching really beautiful with that
being said I have never purchased
anything from it see I remember I came
close a couple times because I believe
they have done collaborations with
coffee break with Danny and then also
Michelle from Ready Set glamour and I
almost bought both of their
collaborations but I never did I believe
that you only get it C on their website
feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or
if I see something differently online
I'll have it in the description box but
I believe they are just available on the
it C site so with that being said 35
dollars for four items products it's
pretty pricey to me especially because
three of them are going to be
highlighters and like I just said I
don't need highlighters I might have
been more convinced to buy this if it
was three blushes and a highlight
instead because I've really been on like
the blush train lately like I've been
wanting to get more blushes for my
collection and I'm you know not trying
to buy highlights so maybe if it was
slipped I'd consider it I don't think
that you can buy these individually I
think you do have to buy them in the
collection you just don't have to buy
the magnetic palette with it but you can
spend the 50 to get the palette if you
want so it's just not something that I
need for my collection right now and
it's going to be a little bit too pricey
I do enjoy collaborations with you know
youtubers and instagramers and just
other Beauty influencers but I you know
I definitely am NOT able to support
every single person's collaboration out
there that's just not possible and I'm
actually not familiar with a love for
lacquer and I know I feel like I say in
so many videos they're not familiar with
people but I really am very new to the
YouTube game I started watching YouTube
probably like six months before I
started a channel I didn't even like I
knew YouTube was there but I didn't
really get it like I'm getting to know
more and more people and especially
through you guys and through your
comments I've been finding so many more
people to watch and then I've made a
friends with which I'm super grateful
for but I'm actually just I'm not
familiar with love for lacquer so you
know also not knowing the collaborator
doesn't make me have a huge pull to buy
something what a brand I'm not familiar
with products I don't need and spending
more than I would want to so I am
passing over this collaboration with
love for lacquer and it's sea beauty but
I would love to know in the comments
down below have you guys gotten this
were you totally drawn to this
collaboration do you love love for
lacquer and should I be watching her
like let me know what you guys think
because again I really do trust a lot of
your faces opinions and I found
good other youtubers to watch but let me
know what you think in the comments down
below if you got it if you passed over
it and your thoughts on the
collaboration so this week's video it
was really tough because normally for my
advice I'm talking about four separate
items or collections and I kind of go I
start from what I got the least amount
of requests up and work my way up and
the fourth product that I talk about in
these videos is the one that was the
most requested for this week these two
we're really freaking close for the
first one I'm going to talk about is
from Urban Decay
but you guys didn't know they were
coming out with a new release huh my
Instagram was like blowing up a three
day straight is insane how excited you
guys were over the naked heat palette so
Urban Decay cosmetics I think they're
coming out with a full collection yes
they're coming out with the naked heat
collection but everybody's been asking
me about the eyeshadow palette it took
me like a full day to realize that there
was other items with this collection
because that's only getting sent photos
of the eyeshadow palette so that I set
up house $54 they are also going to have
a three bites lipsticks and to glide on
eye pencils but I'm just talking about
the eyeshadow palette here it says June
12 is going to be a pre-sale on their
website first for beauty junkie members
the official launch will be June 30th of
the online at Sephora alpha beauty July
10th and in stores July 13th
so let's chat about this one because I
know a lot of you guys were very excited
so I did not have a time it from Urban
Decay I've talked about urban decay and
passive Olivia's videos I said that I
don't have a ton from them they have
always been a brand that just hasn't
like screamed my name for whatever
reason so I've just never bought a ton
from them I do have the naked smoky
palette and I really really enjoy it my
brother-in-law actually got it for me
for Christmas and I've had a really good
time with that palette and it definitely
made me enjoy the Naked palette seemed
like great palette I know a lot of
people talk very highly about the naked
palettes I've always kind of felt like a
bad beauty blogger that I didn't have
this Naked palette but that's just what
it is what it
I can't have them all so and then make
it heat it looks like it looks
like a pallet that I could fall in love
with right like the colors are beautiful
you'd read plumb clean it looks the name
says it all like make it heat it looks
heat fire like that suppose palette or
minds Mia and it looks gorgeous
definitely to me screams more fall than
it does summer I don't know if anyone
else thinks that but like to me my eyes
are like that is a good fall palette $54
that's pretty expensive to me I know the
naked palettes are usually up there
that's kind of pricey for a palette I
normally try to stay more in like the 30
$40 is usually getting pretty high so 54
like this that's quite a bit of money I
don't know this one I'm really torn
about I really am I would like to get it
because I feel like really that this is
one of the first naked palettes that
really caught my attention it definitely
made me do a double-take for sure 100% I
say my Bolivia videos with products
something we do a double-take I don't
even want to entertain the idea of
getting them just move on to the next
product because there's so much makeup
out there it definitely made me do a
double take because the shades just are
so me they're so beautiful
and I think it's a gorgeous palette but
the price is getting to me
it really is it's just a lot of money to
spend on an eyeshadow palette and I'm
I'm pretty I try to be pretty conscious
of my money especially when it comes to
spending it on makeup because I have a
lot of makeup a lot of these things it's
not like oh I need that it's I want that
and I'm trying to decide if once it's
good enough for $54 because I feel like
- even looking at the swatches I feel
like I have a lot of similar shades and
like my morphe 35o even my Anastasio
modern renaissance you know palettes
like that I feel like I would probably
have like somewhat decent similar shades
to what I'm seeing in this palette but I
also am saying recently that I'm trying
to expand I'm trying to get outside my
comfort zone when it comes to brains I'm
trying to try more brands and even
though I have tried every decay in the
past I only have one palette from them
and I didn't even buy myself like I was
a gift so I'm trying to decide if I
should do it can you tell that I'm torn
I really am because I I do I want this I
want it to
this palace and I think I'm going to get
it I think I'd like to talk to myself
into it in this video I think I did it I
think I talked myself into it I really
do love the shades in there they look
really nice and I hear good things about
the Urban Decay eye shadows I hear good
things about their formulas they clearly
do something right if they have so many
different naked palettes and people
really seem to enjoy them and keep
buying them it makes me think that this
would be okay to purchase and if I can
wait till it comes to you know Sephora
Alton get some points and use my Ebates
and all that stuff you know Mac shoot
colors off and maybe it'll make it a
little bit better it looks like it also
comes with a Dibble and a brush is that
double into brush I can't tell from that
photo but comes with a brush I think I'm
going to try to get it what do you guys
think do you think I'm crazy do you
think it's not worth it let me know if
you're excited for this one because I
feel like I know a lot of you are
because I got so many types on it but
let me know if you're thinking about
getting it or try to talk me out of it
because you guys have talked me out of
makeup purchases before when I said it's
going to buy something in a will I buy
video your comment talk to me out of it
so if anyone wants to talk to me out of
a $54 eyeshadow palette like be my
freaking guest as of right now I'm
leaning on getting it would you guys
want to see a review video on it so you
guys know if it's worth the $54 let me
know in the comments down below I want
to hear your thoughts here give it to me
so it's the Urban Decay palette wasn't
the most requested what in the world
could have been the most requested
Friday - dog wat masseuse Olivia video
did you say don't let Jackson sales
coming out with the new palette with
morphe brushes oh my goodness this
palette really has been requested since
we first found out that Jacqueline was
coming out with a palette with more few
brushes people have been asking me to
include it in a lullaby yet video and
I've kept having to respond to be like
well I need to wait to see the palette
you know I have no idea and now we have
finally seen the palette I know there
was a lot of craziness going on with
this release and to me it's just
disappointing because I feel like
there's so many people out there that
want to create drama where there is no
drama or if there is a little bit of
drama they just want to expand on it and
make it the biggest thing ever and I
hear talk about drama because I just
don't care and it means nothing to me it
does not affect my life in any way the
only thing that I'm worried
is am I going to buy this pellet or am I
not going to buy palette so the palette
from Jaclyn hill and morphe brushes it
is launching on June 21st there's going
to be 35 custom shades it's going to be
$38 looking at the palette I mean to me
it's definitely a Jaclyn hill palette
I've been reading that people are saying
that the morphe formula it supposed to
be amped up for this palette if the
formula is anywhere near what is in the
35 our palette which is one of the more
recent market
releases I would be so happy if it's
better since 35 are I would be like out
of this world happy because I love the
formula that is in the 35 our pellet
it's the best formula that I've tried
out of the morphe brushes palettes and I
just think it's absolutely incredible
the 35 our is one of my favorites so now
some people don't like morphe I do I am
one who loves morphe I have a lot of
their makeup I have a lot of their
palettes I have a ton of their brushes
and I like them I'm not affiliated with
morphe I don't have a discount code
morphe doesn't know who I am and that's
fantastic I can still like a brand and
still recommend a brand if I truly
enjoyed them since I would truly
recommend them I can still do that so
for me I enjoy morphe and I like their
makeup and I like their brushes like I
said I do like Jaclyn hill when I first
saw the palette of course I did a
double-take like obviously I did like a
quadruple take and I do love the palette
I don't know if maybe I was expecting
something else I'm not sure I'm gonna
talk about the cakes I don't even feel
like I looked at the cake when I came
out so I really did not know what to
expect I don't know I don't know what I
was expecting from the palette but maybe
it wasn't 100% as' but still it doesn't
mean that I wasn't excited for it
because I see a lot of shades in here
that I totally would use and I think
that I would love and I think I would
really get on with these shades so I
think that's great
the only thing that I don't love is the
price because $38 and I'm like I kind of
thought that it would probably be more
than the regular morphe palette which
usually run for like 20 to 99 so I was
like maybe it'll be like 25 or $28 and
then when we got hit with 38 I was like
huh that kind of came out of left field
and I don't really know I don't know if
we've got like an explanation for why
the price is so high because that to me
is really legitimately high for a morphe
palette and I know people will be like
for the 35 shades yeah but so is the 3
cycle the 35 th 35 are that's the third
35 shades that's whether what they're
called and those are $22 so why is the
38 that is extremely expensive to me and
that is really the only part
like if it was $32 30 32 dollars I would
say guess right away like 38 is making
me actually reconsider it because I I
don't know I don't I just don't really
like that I I don't like that a brand is
affordable they're known for being
affordable yet still having good
products in my opinion and then they do
a collaboration with a youtuber and it
is almost the double on the price of
what of how it would normally run for I
don't really appreciate that and it kind
of is a little it just is leaving me
with a bad taste in my mouth does
anybody else feel that way or you know
do you just not care like the price
isn't important to you and like I
understand that it is a collaboration
and usually collaborations are a little
bit more with any company out there
usually if they are doing some sort of
collab it's like to to like eight
dollars more I would say I don't know I
literally usually see like two to four
dollars is what I see when
collaborations come out compared to
regular releases so for $38 I had to
really stop think about this one because
that's man that's pricey for a morphe
palette with that being said what that
being said I think I'm still going to do
it and then this is where I kind of get
caught up and I feel like I should only
get one of the other I should only get
the Urban Decay or I should only get the
morphe I should I just don't feel like I
should need to buy two eyeshadow
palettes right around the same time I
just don't think I should do it
especially for to higher
Price pallets 54 versus 38 so it kind of
makes me want to reconsider to the urban
decay because that's even more money I
might I might know I might now retract
when they said about urban decay now
that I'm thinking Israel again where the
oil I buy I'm thinking it through and
I'm like maybe I should not you know
let's forgo the $54 eye shadow palette
let's press $38 eyeshadow palette I
might have to do that I don't know if I
can really justify getting two at the
same time I've just been sent some like
amazing packages and gifts from my
subscribers and a lot of them include
eyeshadow palettes and I still like I'm
trying so hard to work my way through
them and I'm really struggling so like
why would I buy two eyeshadow palettes
if I don't think I'd be able to get the
correct use out of them so that's kind
of where I'm at I haven't feeling a
launch day for the morphe palette is
going to be an absolute disaster is
giving me Carli bybel BH Cosmetics
flashbacks already so I feel like
there's really no guarantee for either
palette really that I would get them but
I feel like the morphe releasing it's
going to be quite the hot mess but I
think I'm still going to get it like I
said I do enjoy morphe I hate that I
feel like I have to defend myself
for liking a brand people are just so
strange about it but morphe is a brand
that I've been buying for before I had
my youtube channel I continue to buy
from them I had no affiliation with them
anything like that I purchased from them
very often I really like their stuff I
believe in their quality and I really do
like Jaclyn hell she was one of the very
first teachers I've ever watched she
kind of can remind me of myself
sometimes when she talks about like
starting from the bottom because let me
tell you i from the bottom so I get a
lot of like motivation from her when she
talks walk past and when she's overcome
what she's been through and I like to
support youtubers that I really feel a
connection with and Jacqueline Hill is
definitely one of those so I would love
to be able to support in that way
I just sincerely wish the price was not
what it was because it just leaves me
with a really really bad taste in my
mouth but I think that I will still try
to get the palette I've been really
excited for it since knowing that she
was coming up with a collaboration with
more feet and know
like the morphe pellets and knowing that
I left the shades in there and then I
would get a lot of use out of them makes
me want to do it so now I'm kind of on
the fence about urban decay if the
Jacquelyn palette wasn't coming out I'd
still say yes to the urban decay but now
I haven't gonna have to think about it a
little bit more let me know what you
guys think in the comments down below if
you think I just need both of them do
you do you do you think anyone enough or
do you think that I shouldn't get the
more fuel line I should get the urban
decay I would just love to know your
thoughts to consider see your grants
come and sell me out so much we have so
many conversations in the comments and I
always appreciate it so let me know what
you think let me know if you're going to
get this palette let me know if you
didn't like the price either what your
thoughts are about that just let me know
what you're thinking about the
collection because I'd love to know your
thoughts and if you're going to get this
but after that that's going to be the
final product that I'm talking about and
this week's will I buy it all right guys
so that's going to be everything for
this week's delay by a video I really
hope that you enjoyed this video or
found it helpful or entertaining in some
way I feel like I was on the struggle
bus so with this will I buy a video this
one was really difficult for me a lot of
times in my will I bias like you know
sure I see that products are coming out
but a lot of times I don't sit down and
really think about it until I come on
camera because I want you to see a
genuine thought process when it comes to
buying makeup and that it shouldn't just
feel like oh that palette came out boom
getting it I want to see the actual
process and sometimes it's not super
simple sometimes it can be like last
week like what's hard you guys were like
that was so funny how fast you flew
through those chart items sometimes it's
not always going to be this way and I
kind of struggle a lot with the urban
decay and the Jaqueline so I would love
to know your guys's feedback down below
if you guys struggle like me when it
comes to making your makeup decisions

makeup and you know I just try to be
