today's video is going to see my latest
will I buy it I post my relevant videos
every single Wednesday around talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm going to pick them up or pass over
them I do post these every single
Wednesday like I said so I will have my
playlist linked down below in case
you're interested in catching up with
any of my past videos in addition to my
will advice I'm also posting every
single day right now and I'm also going
to be doing a live chat on Thursdays I'm
switching out my schedule a little bit
moving my live chat from Tuesday's to
Thursday nights at 7:30 p.m. at CSP if
you'd ever like to come by and chat live
with me and some of my friends but if
you would like to see my latest edition
of will I bias why don't we go ahead and
get started alright so the first item
that I saw getting requested to do it in
a wilayat video and I literally tally up
all of the votes all of the suggestions
that come through and then I choose the
top four from there that were requested
on it so while this one had been
requested it hadn't been overwhelmingly
requested to make it into a pass top 4
but since the release and since videos
about it now even more people are asking
me it sounds like okay I'm going to go
ahead and put it in this week's will I
buy video that is a new product from
CIPA London it's their glitter flip
liquid lipsticks so they're a liquid
lipstick but then they have glitters in
them there are seven different shades
and what you can do is you can apply the
liquid lipsticks on your lips and you
let it dry completely and then when you
press your lips together a like
activates glitter so literally like I've
seen some of the videos myself you
applied the lipstick you let it dry so
it looks like a regular liquid lipstick
and then when you like do that your lips
are now glittery and I'm like how they
do that like it's like a magic trick I'm
like wait I am NOT another inning so
obviously because this was being tagged
on the Wi-Fi changes because this dog
trend miss page who I will have trend
mood on her Instagram link down below
excite typically read from her for these
videos I saw it and I was like okay so
it's intriguing that's innovative like
super cool that's awesome but my first
thought was like what I'm just
into it because it's just not me I talk
about a lot of my bullet bite videos I'm
not a big like literary person I'm not
big on glitter lips and not big on
metallic lips it's just not something
that I wear often enough that I feel
like it's really worth it to go ahead
and make that purchase when I'm buying
my makeup I'm really trying to buy the
things that I'm going to wear and reach
for and use on a consistent basis I
still don't think these interest me
enough to get them I think it'd be like
fun and intriguing
it makes for like a good Instagram video
that YouTube video it to me that's not a
good enough reason to buy makeup I'm
never going to buy makeup because I
think it's going to get a lot of hits on
Instagram I don't post clickbait
Instagram tutorials I pose actual makeup
tutorials on Instagram I don't contour
my face with bacon or a Starbucks cup I
don't I don't do that because it's just
not my style I'm bummed because I get it
and I get I get the intrigue of them but
I cannot see myself reaching for these
aren't any sort of consistent basis just
just none the only $19 which I don't
think is like a terrible price or
anything for a lipstick but still it's
not going to be for me you know the
shades are really for me it's just not
for me all around these are available at
Sephora now so I'll go ahead and link
them down below but if you like the
glitter list I would say check them out
because it looks very cool it looks very
interesting like nothing against EF de
London I actually just recently tried
one of their regular liquid lipsticks
and was really really have been enjoying
that but these just don't interest me
they're just not my personal makeup
vibes so I would rather spend my money
on something that is my makeup but if
you know what I mean so I'm going to
continue to pass over this tea at their
London glitter philippa lipstick so let
us know if you service continum and what
you think about are you getting some
types on this pretty recently but I got
quite a few of them this is a new
collaboration between balm on and
L'Oreal makeup or Salman X L'Oreal it
includes 12 new matte lipsticks and
they're going to be $14 each so the
collaboration also includes three
wearable lipstick jewels the lipstick
pendants come with golden chains like
can be worn around your neck very
intriguing I guess um so I thought
they're $14 each and they'll be
available on September 20th so that's
interesting balm on and L'Oreal I don't
know if I would have thought like those
two would necessarily go together but
there's that they have you know a pretty
decent color range with 12 lipsticks I
see like a blue and a purple and a green
and then you know the reds and the
natives and the pinks and all that so
it's a pretty good collection $14 I mean
I don't think it's a bad price it's a
little high for a L'Oreal being a
drugstore brand but then they're also
teaming up with balm on so it's like I
don't know like some of these
collaborations that are that are coming
out recently I just
they kind of like catch me off-guard
like I'm like wait what like hmm so I
have to say that there's really that
much that interest with me so it also
says it will be available at L'Oreal
makeup and Barneys New York so I don't
know if that will be the only two places
that they'll be available but I just I
don't think I'm going to get it L'Oreal
like I like L'Oreal for their like
foundations I have quite a few L'Oreal
foundations but there's not a lot else
from boreal that really interests me
like when I go to the drugstore and I go
into the makeup section I'm typically
not usually stopping at L'Oreal if
there's other brands that catch my
attention bar and this for some reason
this collaboration chances are really
doing anything for me um it's a lipstick
and I love lipstick and I buy a lot of
lipstick but even still I'm just like I
feel like this is one that I can skip
over and I would be okay with it I know
a lot of people are really excited about
this collaboration and you know of
course it's in a way my video so I was
getting a ton of tags on it so I want to
hear your guys's thoughts too so let us
know why you're excited about balm on
Excel Orioles next up is another
collaboration that I found very
interesting this is of the emotional and
Sephora limited edition collection
hopefully I'm saying that right Moshi no
I feel like I'm saying it wrong so their
collection includes the bear eye shadow
palette with 21 different shades and
finishes four core
there's a bear lipgloss chain with six
glosses for 32 a bear highlighter for 22
a bear brush set with five brushes for
fifty for a shopping bag mini palette
for $18 a bear I'm ass for $20 of their
compact mirror for $18 and a perfume for
$89 so it has already gone for sale at
Sephora online but as I'm looking at
appears everything is sold out and I
think it sold out and came back in stock
and then sold out again but I think it's
going to come back online but then it's
also supposed to be in all stores on
August 24th in Canada August 25th I
don't know what it is about these
collaborations that are just interested
in it I'm not trying to say I think that
they're like ad collaborations it's just
not something that I guess I'm expecting
like every time a new one pops up with
the Bombay and L'Oreal the most you know
Sephora I'm like huh it's just
interesting as all so there's a lot in
this collection of course a lot of
things that I don't quite get I know a
lot of people are really excited for it
so I don't want to like I don't know I
don't want to be sounding like really
rude but a lot of it just looks really
young to me so I'm not quite
understanding like all of these bearer
things like the compact that's shaped
like a bear I guess I'm just not really
into it I guess that's not it's not my
personal makeup style or my makeup eyes
like I like to say if it's yours than
those awesome you probably freaking buzz
this collection so that's super cool but
it's just not my personal style so I
don't know just a lot of it did not
really catch my attention and like even
the brushes it's like a sort of kind of
weird looking and I'm so sorry I don't
mean to like rain on anybody's parade
but it just was kind of interesting to
me so the things that I did think was
cute with that shopping bag mini palette
like I liked the packaging on that one
like the highlight compact and that
looks like a bear as well like all these
bear things I don't know I guess maybe
if I was like a really big bear fan I
would be into it I'm not sure and then
the eyeshadow palette is literally
shaped like a giant bear I was
what is all of this I don't know it's
really interesting it's pretty unique
my style it's just it's just not my
style and that's probably the biggest
factor of why I'm not buying anything
from the collection
I just don't gravitate towards any of it
but I know again I know a lot of you are
excited for it so you can let us know
why again there's a lot of things in
here that I simply don't need I want to
highlight no bye I don't really wear lip
gloss so I have some on today the
brushes dear lord I don't need any more
brushes and I just bought them over the
weekend because a week because a week
I'm asked I'm just not super interested
in I don't need a compact mirror perfume
for $89 not something that I need the
eyeshadow palette definitely is is
interesting but just not for me
and then that shopping bag mini toilet
for $18 like if I had to buy anything
from this collection that is what I was
buy I also think it's kind of weird
though because it's like how does it fit
into the collection everything else
legitimately has a bear Armand so how
does the shopping bag in there like what
that doesn't make any sense to me but I
don't know that's one that I like but I
don't need any eyeshadow palettes right
now and that's kind of you know the big
thing behind the will advise the will
advice were inspired from the anti hulls
which is about the consumerism and not
just buying makeup just to buy it
thinking do I actually need that will I
actually use that is that something that
my collection actually needs will I
regret if I don't buy that type of thing
and I know this collection I just I
don't need anything from it nothing made
me do a double-take and I just the whole
vibe of the whole collection is just not
on my personal style and that's really
the biggest thing for me so I know that
I'm passing over the whole Meschino
Sephora collection I'm so sorry I've
been saying that wrong the whole time
that's know in the comments down below
if you did pick up anything from the
collection or if you still want to once
it comes available in stores I'd really
love to know your thoughts on this
collection that was really interesting
that the most amount of tags and snaps
and questions that I got for this week
was another collaboration and this is
between ziwei cosmetics and Jeffrey star
and I guess I don't
why I thought it was interesting just
sometimes I don't know I've made a lot
of comments about like not supporting
Jeffrey star in like a handful of videos
but I still continually get asked
continually get us and get tagged which
I just find to be interesting and I know
that you know as my channel grows you
know people haven't seen my past videos
and they don't know that I've never
heard me say that so I understand why
but I think I mentioned this another
will I buy it too when someone was like
why do you continually talk about the
same brand if we know that you're not
buying from them and I explained because
not everybody might know as you know a
channel grows and gets more subscribers
not everybody goes back and watches your
400 past videos so I decided to go ahead
and talk about it in this video and just
kind of explain my reasonings so the
collab between issue a and Jeffrey star
is a lift topper in sweet tooth it's a
glitter pink it can be worn alone or on
top of any lipstick it's sixteen dollars
will be available August 26 online at UA
cosmetics and it will also go up on
Beauty lish and it does say that I
Jeffrey star will donate his proceeds to
the Los Angeles LGBT Center ok awesome
so I am NOT going to be buying this I
mean one of the biggest reasons of
course is that I'm not really down the
list hoppers it's kind of exactly what I
talked about with the CIA London it's
just not my vibe so to violet pepper
just when it makes sense to me I've
never bought any visual a lip Stoppers
I've never really had any interest in
them I actually don't really own much
from anyway I think I want a couple of
like samples from them but I've never
bought anything from she white not a
brand that I'm loyal to I have nothing
against ziwei by any means it's just not
a friend that's really ever like caught
my attention to the point where I've
bought our products and then with
Jeffers are one thing that I thought was
interesting because I mentioned it I
think it was actually in last week so I
buy it when I was talking about benefit
and someone comments in that video and
said you know you should really rethink
supporting Jeffrey star because what he
did was over ten years ago and you know
we need to move on and below blah and
I'm like I don't even know what you're
talking about
I don't know what happened ten years ago
what has me upset with Jeffrey star is I
actually used to watch
his YouTube I used to follow him on
snapchat there was one night on snapchat
that he went off on another beauty
influencer and just calling her
disgusting vile names and I just thought
like I couldn't finish watching his
snapchats because I was like what is he
doing what is he doing and this was not
that long ago you know a year ago maybe
and that's kind of when I started saying
hey I'm not going to support you for
sorry anymore because that really made
me pretty sick to be honest and I think
with Jeffery star another reason why I
was just super unimpressed with that
whole situation
I get saying things in the heat of the
moment I really really do but I think
another thing that really bothered me
was that he's not only a beauty
influencer he owns a cosmetics company
he owns jeffree star cosmetics so when
you see someone like that attacking
someone in their same industry I just
don't get it I don't get it at all it
was so completely unprofessional
and it just was really disheartening to
me that was when I decided to make the
decision that I wasn't going to support
so it doesn't have anything to do with
this path or who he used to be because
if people were judging me on how I was
when I was 20 years old in college I
would be horrified because I was 20
years old in college it was a more
recent event and then from there nothing
really that I've seen from Jeffrey star
has been interesting me he started like
a fight with two-faced and he just seems
to always be in the center of this drama
and as someone who's a professional in
this industry I just don't really get it
and that's why I don't support why and
that's you know another big reason I
don't own anything from jeffree star
cosmetics I have no plans purchase
anything from Jeffery star cosmetics
like I said I'm not going to hold that
against um forever
I mean maybe next year I will be totally
on his bandwagon and buying all those
products I don't know but I made the
decision not to support and from then I
have not really seen anything that has
changed my mind and then when you see
all this other drama does not who I want
to support so I thought I could bring it
up in this video to let you guys know I
totally do not mind that people
continually tag me on like Jeffrey star
and like Kylie cosmetics and I talk
about Kylie cosmetics a lot I would
never mind that people
me on it so I understand and I
understand you know the new subscribers
thing as well but I just wanted to take
a second and you know be able to share
my voice in my opinion you can agree
with me you can disagree with me that is
totally fine I've never tried to tell
someone that they should not support
jeffree star cosmetics or anybody else
that I don't support I've never tried to
do that if you look back to any of my
will I buy any of my anti-cult I always
say that you get to do what you want to
do it is your money it is your decision
to support who you want to support and
I'm never going to try to change your
mind that's not the point
of my will I buy up videos it's to make
you think about what you're buying and
what you're spending your money on but
it's not to try to dissuade someone on
buying something when you want to have a
civil discussion in the comments about
it I would be more than happy to let's
just keep it keep it kind in the
comments that's really all that I ask
that's what I wanted to say there ends
it really sucks to feel so attacked in
your own comments section when people
are saying that I'm not supporting
someone for the wrong reason not not
saying last week's comment was attacking
because I didn't feel that way at all
and I responded back to her we have a
nice conversation but in the past
especially with anti house it's just
frustrating to be attacked when people
are saying you need to get over what
happened ten years ago and you're like
that's not even what I'm mad at but you
guys can probably tell I'm super
uncomfortable I get really uncomfortable
when I have to talk about things people
situations brands whatever that I don't
necessarily love or like have good
thoughts on it just it makes me
uncomfortable and I know that I'm
opening myself up to a lot of the harsh
comments but at the same time you know I
get to stand up I get to have my voice
in my video saying why I do or do not
support someone I really just don't
think that it's something to judge
people on I mean I just don't think it
does everybody has their own opinions
and it's what makes the world go around
if we all like the same thing are the
same people I would say make up or the
same colors are the same teams or the
same music life would be incredibly
boring and I don't think YouTube would
be a thing because we'd all be saying
the exact same thing and that'd be super
boring but I I do not have plans to
purchase the laptop er a it just would
not fit into my collection it's not
anything that I'm interested in she way
isn't a brand
loyal - and I don't Forge every star at
this time so after that that's going to
do it for this week's will advice video
I guess that's going to be everything it
for this week's a will I buy it video I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video or found it helpful or
entertaining or something in any way I
really hope that you do I not to stay
super negative in my videos it's just
not to my thighs and you can probably
tell that I'm just like a low off now
because like that's just like my fun
situation for me to do and like I said
if you guys don't have any sort of
comments or discussions in my comment
section I do read and respond to all of
the comments so as long as they can keep
it kind there I do respond back to
everybody but let me know what you
thought about all the products that I
mentioned this week and also be sure to
let me know what you want to see in next
week's will i buy it video thank you
guys so much for coming by I really do
appreciate it I hope that you will give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy

subscribing before you go and I'll catch
