today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my villa by videos every
single Wednesday where I'm chatting
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then talking over if I'm
going to pick them up or pass over them
and as always I have a lot to chat about
this week so why don't I go ahead and
get started
ready so did you jumping into this week
I got a lot of tags on this and I think
it's because a lot of people know that
I've really enjoyed this brand but dose
of colors just released new lip glosses
they have 12 new glasses eight says it's
a new formula it's non sticky a high
gloss finish they are 17 dollars each I
have seen these already available on the
uLTA Beauty website and also the dose of
colors website as well I have never
tried the dose of colors lip gloss a
formula I do really enjoy their liquid
lipsticks and then I also do have one of
their like kind of regular creamy
lipsticks and some of my favorites I
enjoy the dose of colors brand so much
there's not a lot from them that I have
tried that I have not like fallen
absolutely in love with and so when I
saw these I was like I kind of want to
pick one up I have been over here like
the lip gloss trend is coming back but
oh no no don't really matter to me I'm
not gonna wear that much lip gloss
because I love liquid lipsticks and now
all of a sudden I keep finding myself
reaching for certain lip glosses like
I'll put my liquid lipstick on even now
be like hmm
I'm just gonna grab this gloss real
quick and I'm like no come on come on
man it's happening I'm definitely
wearing lip glosses more I have been
finding myself we went out the other
weekend and I put four lip glosses in my
clutch with me I mean I didn't realize I
there was already two in there so
there's that but then I grabbed another
two because I was like I'm not sure
which one I want and later that night
when I went to grab out a lip gloss I
pulled out four and I was like girl
can't see Kathir do so yeah okay so I'm
wearing lip gloss so there's that but I
really do think that I want to try some
of these I just got the 20% off coupon
for Ulta this morning which has me
really excited and I have a bunch of
points that I was thinking about
redeeming
so I'm kind of thinking about that one I
they the glasses were a little bit
cheaper than $17 does anyone else feel
like 17 is maybe a little bit high for a
lip gloss I mean I mean I'm someone who
loves will purchase the Marc Jacobs lip
glosses which are more than $17 but
still like when they're liquid lipsticks
are $18 I'm like I just feel like a
gloss should be more than a dollar
cheaper you know what I'm saying because
especially with glass like you do have
to reapply gloss more than you would a
liquid lipstick you go through a quicker
and I don't know I just don't feel like
it gives like as much of an impact as a
regular lipstick or liquid lipstick so
I'm like 17 dollars I still feels like
high but if I have 20% off and I have my
points at Ulta maybe it wouldn't be as
bad but I'm super interested in these I
want to go through look at swatches a
little bit more closely and see Ike I
can't decide if I'm leaning towards a
nude gloss or a pink gloss because like
I'm always into news but right now I'm
also super into Pink's so hmm can't
really decide but I do have a really
nice nude lipstick from dose of colors
what's it called it came from the
Snuggle is real scent and it's like the
really peachy nude and I really like it
but I love it with a gloss even more so
I was thinking of maybe getting a nude
gloss from dose of colors and then
pairing those two together which i think
would look really pretty but yeah I'm
very interested in these I love those
colors as a brand I would like to try
out their lip glosses as well but what
do you think about this have you tried
the dose of colors lip glosses I know
they say these are new formula because
everybody always has to put out a new
formula which doesn't make any friggin
sense to me but have you guys already
purchased them are you interested in
them let us know I already sell Becca
cosmetics is coming out with a bunch of
new releases Wow
a lot of tags on this one so they have a
new collection coming up called ocean
jewels I'm reading now from the trend
would one Instagram page so I will have
her Instagram link it down below like I
normally do it has the ocean Jules
highlight palette for $46 it's limited
edition and features five brand new
shades of the shimmering skin perfecter
press highlight formula there's also the
ocean Jules I showed a palette for $35
routine featuring seven brand new shades
and three versatile finishes creamy
matte metallic and twinkling copper
that's a tongue twister then there's
also the lip to ative glow gloss which
is
five dollars it says it's a customized
pink shade a lip gloss that enhances the
natural color of your lips with the
ultimate high shine finish and it reacts
to the natural chemistry of your lips
blooming into your perfect shape the
globe gloss $25 okay so I just said
seventeen dollars is really high for a
lip gloss now we're talking 25 dollars
I'm like oh I don't know about that and
I'm not sure I think it's really cool
how it says like it'll react to your
body and it'll kind of turn your own
unique color the packaging on it
packaging like all of this collection
looks really freaking cool but like I'm
interested but I'm not interested enough
for twenty-five dollars but you know
what I mean especially when it's like
what color are you gonna get what if you
don't like it what if you don't like the
way that it reacts to your natural body
chemistry hmm
then that would be a bummer but like I
said especially since I just talked
about the dohsa colors lip gloss I would
ride rather purchase that one then I
would the $25 one from Becca so I would
pass over the lip gloss the ocean Jules
eyeshadow pellet for $35 $35 I guess I
don't know isn't a terrible price for
Becca for seven products uh cos more
high-end the packaging looks really cool
it looks like a seashell packaging which
i think is very neat but I don't know
kind of like the layout and such
reminded me of the Becca like the price
geek globe eye palette that came out
around the holiday time and that one
like did not get good reviews like at
all like I don't know if I thought maybe
I saw one positive I feel like I saw one
positive review of that eyeshadow
palette other than that it didn't so I
don't know if maybe just like the layout
wise inside kind of reminded me of that
one that's kind of like what my mind
went to right away and I was like I
don't know about that so I don't know I
haven't tried any Becca eyeshadows and
mostly more on their face products I
actually have a bronzer and blush on
from bucket today so I'm more into like
the face product so I think I would also
pass over the eyeshadow palette you know
of course I'm gonna watch reviews of it
and maybe this one will be absolutely
amazing but from what I've seen and what
I know like I I feel like I can skip
over that I also have plenty of
eyeshadow palettes so I'm gonna skip
over that one doesn't doesn't called me
thing that made me do a double-take was
that cool gel packaging but I try
try not to buy just for packaging
sometimes I fail though but I try let's
see and then the ocean Jules Highlander
pellet for $46 is definitely the one I
think that I got be most tags on and the
one that I kind of looked at really hard
I'll try to be inserting the best photos
that I can in this video of course but
the packaging on this one again like
packaging across this entire collection
like I said I think is really really
cool but I'm not I'm not sold on the
highlight palette and like I have plenty
of Becca highlights I have the champagne
glow face palette with champagne pop for
psycho pop I have the appraised key glow
face palette with rose quartz and opal
in there like I have a lot of about two
highlights which is fantastic so I'm
like do I really need this highlight
palette and it does say it has five
brand new shades which i think is good
because I feel like a lot of times with
these palettes you're kind of getting
free peach shades over and over again
it's like well I already have that one
but now I'm gonna buy a pellet that
already has up I'm like you know I'm
saying so I'm like I think that was cool
to see the five new shades
there are also some interesting ones
like just looking at the photo and and
swatches like I don't know for sure how
this would react to the skin like kind
of more of like a yellow and a blue and
then there's a darker one things like
that I don't know if I would get the
most use out of that I like that it's
also going to be the same formula when I
switch enough formulas because it's
something that drives me insane like you
you grow to love something from a brand
then they're like actually we guys I'm
new for you it's like just give us what
we want man give us what we love so I
enjoy seeing though it would be the same
formula but I don't know if I would get
enough use out of all of the different
shades in there for $46 like I do want
to get all of the shades you know now
I'm flashing back to the bucket of pray
speak a little face palette that has six
shades I use every single shade in there
every single one it was $54 I believe I
paid for it but don't even care because
I get so much use out of that palette
it's crazy so I'm still reaching for
that one I still love that one so much I
feel like I would still gravitate
towards that one versus this new one
from Becca so it's like me do I really
need to pay the forty six dollars for a
new one I don't think so also if you
guys do not follow me on a few other
for my husband to just lose his job so
this will I buy it is kind of
challenging to make because I am now the
sole income for our family and I have a
career based out of doing things I love
like reading books and making YouTube
videos I am NOT in either of those
industries for the Paycheck so try and
stay bus so that definitely could be
something that will you might see
reflected in you know upcoming will
invite videos how videos review Vita
videos things like that it's you know
it's something that is a very huge part
of my life right now and something that
we were sort of trying to figure out and
our future is very unknown at this
moment so it was kind of challenging so
wanted to sneak that one in here as well
and again if my mood has seemed a little
bit off in videos it's because we're
dealing with something very serious
right now but yeah like I said for $46
knowing that I love a highlight palette
even more and that I get plenty of use
out of I just don't think I would need
this one the pan sizes also do look kind
of small which I don't always love
because it's kind of harder to dip your
brushes in there and things like that so
I think I'm gonna actually end up
passing over everything packaging looks
really cool you know I definitely was
intrigued by a couple things and took a
closer look at them but overall I
decided from what I have in my
collection
you know life events things like that
how much would I actually use each of
these products I know that I can say no
to all three in the collection but I
would love to know what made you do a
double take
and what are you super excited to pick
up from the collection and I don't think
I said I released it on here it just
says that coming soon so if I have more
information by the time this video goes
live I'll have it in the description box
down below but I'd love to get your
thoughts on this collection already so
next up I was getting a ton of tags on
this one Kristin Dominique she is a
fellow youtuber she is launching her own
makeup brand which is super cool and
very exciting and her first product is
releasing very soon here tomorrow maybe
yes tomorrow hi you guys
my world's been kind of rocked lately I
don't even know what day it is called
dominique cosmetics or her name and the
dominique olate palette is the first
product that's launching and it's $42
it's an eyeshadow palette it says
pre-sell is a January 24th it will ship
internationally and that is what I am
seeing right now so I'll put a photo of
the eyeshadow palette down below and I
have not gonna lie I did a double-take
really hard I love the colors in here I
know I should have so many fun colors in
here like there's these fun pops of this
blue and kind of almost like it looks to
be like a magenta color which i think is
gorgeous but then there's also plenty of
neutrals in there you have your
transition colors and there I feel like
you could create some really fun looks
with this one which i think is awesome
huge congrats to Chris and Dominique I
started watching her channel fairly
recently I want to say maybe like maybe
within the past six months or so and she
has at least a million subscribers I'm
not for sure how many she has but she
has a ton of subscribers she's a huge
name out there but I recently started
following her and I really enjoy her
videos she still like calming and just
she just seems just down-to-earth and I
really enjoyed her tutorials especially
where she does ones like one face like a
certain countries makeup and then once
ever face the other ones you can kind of
compare those are really cool and I was
having a really good time watching all
of her videos on that one I thought was
awesome do you guys follow Kristin
Dominique are you familiar with the name
I know there's so many youtubers out
there like it's basically impossible to
be familiar with all of them but I was
really excited when I saw that she was
launching her own makeup brand that's
super cool like major kudos that's
awesome
but I really I would love this palette
but especially with everything that's
happening right now I do have to be
pretty careful of the makeup purchases
I'm doing pretty much anything that I'll
be buying makeup wise is going to be via
gift cards or points or if I have some
sort of crazy deal or discount or things
like that
I just kind of have to be I have to be a
little bit more conscious of what it is
that I'm buying lately and not just with
makeup with really anything in general I
mean I'm sure there's a lot of people
out there who have gone through
something like this as well and you know
you can probably relate to when it's
still really unknown and still really
new you just kind of have to be just
more careful so I wanted to mention that
I've talked about it on a few of my
other social media platforms but I did
want to mention it here as well because
it's definitely something that's going
to me have to you know think a little
bit more carefully about my
my makeup purchases and all of that I
truly think that if if all of this
wasn't going on right now or if we
already had some sort of plan in place
or something like that
I think that I would purchase the pallet
I think it's really pretty I would love
to be able to support but with
everything going on I just don't think
it's gonna be wise to spend $42 on an
eyeshadow palette and you know it's a
brand new brand I don't know how things
are gonna go I don't know how the
shipping will be the customer service I
know nothing about the formula you know
there's no reviews out there yet besides
I think just Kristen's video talking
about the palette so would it be the
smartest thing for me to do probably not
at this moment but I'm really excited
for I think the pellet looks really
pretty big congrats to her I would love
to know if you guys are planning on
purchasing this palette as well when it
releases and of course I'll have some
links and down below if you're
interested in I'll link her YouTube
channel to things like that but yeah big
congrats to her it looks really cool but
I'm not to pass over it and then last of
the palette that I got so many tags on
is a new one from a dubious place
they're coming out with the festival
palette and it will be part of a
collection I know there's gonna be some
lipsticks involved as mostly just
getting tags and questions about the
actual palette so that's what I'm going
to chat about says it'll be available on
a February 15th I didn't see a price but
I'm thinking it will probably be around
2150 or so because that is what the
other dubious place palettes that are
similar to this packaging and number of
shades and all of that that's what there
are listed on the dubious plays website
so the festival palette I mean I feel
like all of the palettes that Julia's
place puts out the packaging is so bomb
on them and they always look amazing and
their shade selections are always just a
little bit unique and different I feel
like there's so many pallets with drew
vias place that we just aren't getting
something a little bit different and my
eyes are definitely drawn to the brand
I actually just mentioned them and it
was at yesterday's video the brands that
I wish would be carried at Sephora and
Ulta and I did mention Julia's plays
note it's more towards buying at the
bigger stores for things like discounts
and rewards and Ebates and the return
policy and you know all of that fun
stuff and especially with what I was
saying right now having to be a little
bit more careful it just that's why I
definitely have this moment to I'm
basically gonna be right right with
Sephora and Ulta for the time being so
that is why I mentioned Julius place in
that video but this one looks really
cool I mean the photo that I'm looking
at right now their looks feel like I've
read in an orange a pink a blue gold or
like I mean this the palette look super
super eye-catching and for the 2150 I
don't think that's a bad price at all I
think Julius place is definitely I mean
they're not like the most affordable
brand ever but I feel like they have
really good prices and I have been able
to try one of their eyeshadow palettes
the mini masquerade and the pigmentation
is so so good and you know I hear really
great reviews about this one this one
definitely caught my attention for sure
but again just kind of with everything
going on I don't think it's gonna pull
me enough to purchase even though $21 is
better than you know the 42 and the 46
that I was mentioning in this video but
I also am pretty happy with my eyeshadow
palette collection I've actually had two
amazing subscribers that send me kind of
like care packages and both included
eyeshadow palettes including the violet
boss hashtag palette which I really
wanted to purchase myself and I had a
subscriber Jill said it's me that's
what's on my eyes today grateful for
things like that and people supporting
during this time it's been it's been
really really awesome so I just kind of
know especially it was just everything
that I have in my collection right now I
really don't need to purchase another
eyeshadow palette and you know need to
be a bit better if not on a no-buy then
I'm a very very strict Loeb I also feel
like I've said this about Julius placed
pellets in the past too but there's
still other ones that I really want to
get from dubious place the blush palette
I've been eyeing for a while but I don't
know the eyeshadow palettes the siharan
has always really caught my attention
and the newer one I think it's called
the do you see shadow palette that one
has caught my attention to a little bit
over like maybe the newer ones which I
know it's really cool to like get the
hot new things all the time sometimes I
am more attracted to some of the older
products too so I think if I were to
make a purchase with dubious place I
would still go with one of the the older
palettes that have interested me for a
while but I'd love to know what you
think about the festival palette from
dubious place I definitely gonna be
ordering it when it comes out in
February are these totally your vibes I
would love to know but after that that's
gonna do it for this week's will I buy a
video okay so that is everything for
this week's that will I write video I
know the will I buy up videos are gonna
be a little bit more challenging for me
to do in the next I mean who knows
upcoming weeks or months or things like
that but I wanted to take a minute and
thank everybody again for all of the
support I've talked a little bit about
it here on YouTube but I've also opened
up on other social media platforms and I
appreciate all the support the love the
kind words the letters that have come in
and the packages as well it's just been
a really overwhelming time and it's it's
been really amazing to see the community
and the friendships that I have formed
with so many people and I just I want to
say that I appreciate it so very much
but other than that that is going to do
it for this week's will I buy up video I
hope that you will let me know what you
thought about all the products that I
mentioned it down below what you are
interested in what you're passing over
and also would you would like to see
include it in next week's syllabi up
video and as always if you guys did
enjoy this one I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you'll also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's video
