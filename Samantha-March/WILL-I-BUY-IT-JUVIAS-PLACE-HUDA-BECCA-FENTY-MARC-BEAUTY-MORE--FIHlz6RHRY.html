today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my Bolivia videos every
single Wednesday we're on talking over
some new makeup releases and just
traveling if I'm planning to pick them
up or if they do not have my interest so
I think we have a time to chat about the
sink so I would go ahead and get started
but first up I have something so
exciting this news made me so freaking
happy my friend here on YouTube Angelica
she actually got to do a collaboration
with Sigma Beauty and put together like
her favorite brushes set from Sigma I
was so excited I saw the video pop up on
my YouTube feed and I said it's my
collaboration of the Sigma beauty and I
was like no freaking way and I clicked
so fast and I was so excited I have
collapsed with angelic on the past I've
put her my newsletter in the past I chat
about her all the time I think I was
just talking about her in my indie
brands video about Divina cosmetics and
I was just so freakin happy and excited
to see this so she released a brush
collab with Sigma and she put together
five of her favorite brushes so it's her
favorite brush set it's $65 it's an 82
dollar value and the brushes inside are
the e 20 short shader the 25 blending
brush the e36 blending brush the e 45
small tapered blending brush and the SL
3 high cheekbone highlighter brush and I
just thought this was so cool I love all
of the brushes I've tried all the
brushes I think I own all of the I own a
lot of Sigma brushes I think I own all
of them in there and I thought her
choices were so perfect and I just this
was so freaking cool to see I of course
will have the link listed down below and
you know am I gonna buy this you know
Angelica's my friend and I'm super
excited for it I love seeing my beauty
the majority of my brush collection is
Sigma brushes so like no I have no
interest in this but I'm just kidding I
already bought it I already bought it
it's already been shipped I don't have
it yet but I've already got the shipping
confirmation I ordered it on the day
that it came out cuz I was just so
freaking excited to see this so have you
guys I have not seen
yet or if you haven't placed your order
yet of course that link will be listed
down below there is a lot of Sigma
affiliate codes I have one at delica has
one there's a lot of influencers that do
have codes for like the 10% off this
particular set is not eligible for a
code but if you were to place an order
with anything else from Sigma like place
one order you get this brush set and
maybe you get a couple other brushes are
some of their makeup items a code can be
applied to all of those items it's just
not the brushes but you can still do it
in one order if that makes sense
I believe that's what Angelica was
saying totally okay because you're
already getting a discount I think she
said the discount in there like if you
were to buy all the brushes separately
as compared to this side it's a twenty
percent off discount anyways so I just
thought that was really cool I
definitely wanted to make sure to
mention it because that's just freaking
awesome I'm so excited for Angelica I
can't wait to get my brushes they're
supposed to be here soon and they have
like you know her photo and everything
and her signature on the box and I'm
just so so proud of my friend a huge
congratulations to Angelica make sure
you go check that out already you guys
know that I have I find a love of minis
whether it comes makeup skincare I love
when companies put out minis and I was
getting a lot of tags on a new product
from Natasha to Nonna
it is their blush and glow compact but
in a mini so inside you have the
all-over glow shimmer powder and number
one and then also the blush from the
blush duo palette number fourteen I'm
reading from the trend mid website her
page will be listed down below as normal
so it's going to be $19 it does
definitely look very teeny-tiny like
from the picture like the person holding
it it definitely looks pretty small but
at the same time like it doesn't look
like minuscule like I can't do anything
with it like you're gonna put your brush
in once and like hit pan or something
like you know you know those like
minions that you would get in like the
Ipsy bags and you're like what do I have
a product here what is this
it doesn't look like it's gonna be that
small and it's only 19 dollars which I
don't think those bad for Natasha - no -
because her prices are so freakin
expensive I'm pretty interested in this
one because for whatever reason I
remember the blush and glow like got my
attention but I think that one was just
like just I can still really expand so
if I was like there's no way you can do
it and
like that that's only the two shades I
feel like I would use them more than you
know buying a big old compact with
multiple shades and not using all of
them in there and again 19 bucks like
I'm pretty understand that one what do
you guys think have you does it say when
it's on sale yet mMmmm online at Sephora
perfect so I don't know let me know if
you guys have picked that one up I think
it looks pretty interesting okay next up
I have a new palette here from Julius
place so this is the warrior palette
it's gonna be $21 and it has nine
different shades so I mean like the
inside of the palette it looks like the
other dubious place palettes I own quite
a few of them now and I think that
they're great quality
I think Juvia spice has really fantastic
eyes shadow quality in all of our
palettes that I have tried I've been
very impressed with them this palette I
feel like a lot of people got caught off
guard with it because it is definitely
more neutral and and dubious place is
kind of known for their very colorful
palettes like a big reason why I didn't
purchase from julius for a very long
time was because I was very intimidated
by the shades inside because not only
are they colorful but in a lot of the
palette I don't get the color scheme you
know like I don't have that mine that
I'm like this is what I'm gonna do with
this palette I look at that palette and
I'm like what could I possibly do with
these colors inside how do I make them
all work together so I was always very
intimidated by dubious plays so I
actually think is pretty smart that
they're coming out this palette because
I think a lot of people are probably
like me as well um you know of course
there's so many people who love the
colorful palettes and the colorful
shades and they're so excited for it but
Julia's place doesn't have a lot of
those palettes so I actually thought it
was pretty smart for them to release
something like this and it has me pretty
excited I think I'm gonna go ahead and
pick this one up too I mean it's
definitely it's very neutral and of
course I probably have a lot of shades
like this in my collection
but I'm just so excited I feel like
they're I don't know I just feel like
this was a pretty solid release from
dubious place the packaging the front of
the cover I mean everything the front of
the cover my book is gonna release in a
couple weeks so that's that's where my
mind
focus if you can tell the front of the
palate it looks absolutely beautiful and
I'm just really feeling on the shades
that are inside $21 I think that's a
great price as well and I think that
you're getting quality shadows of what
Judy is placed all around so I think
this is pretty cool I think this would
be a great addition so like I said I
have a lot of doobies I should have
pellets there blush pellets as well I
think this would be a fantastic addition
there's some of my Juvia spell let's
look I can't do like a full look with
some of the palettes like I'm always
kind of not always but sometimes I'm
grabbing another palette to finish off a
look because I want like that light
brown or you know a deeper brown and I
don't have it in some of my palettes and
I think it would be cool to be able to
come in to this one that way I could do
like a full Julius place I cuz those are
the things that make me happy but I
think that one looks pretty cool I'm
definitely interested in that one both
cosmetics is coming out with a new
eyeshadow palette this is the rose gold
sunset palette it's $10 for 10 different
shades that are both matte and shimmers
you know it's definitely got like those
sunset sunset vibes in there I'll be
including pictures of course I'm not
gonna get this one I have realized that
elf eyeshadows don't don't get along
with my eyes unfortunately I tried like
their oh I can always I kind of remember
I was called it was like nude blush or
something like that
or rose gold blush I don't remember but
I tried one of their palettes a while
ago and I had such an extreme reaction
on my eyes it was horrible I couldn't
wear eye makeup for two days I mean are
you kidding me no I had such a terrible
reaction and then I tried a different
elf palette I tried the mad format -
palette I think it's called like the
summer breeze and I had a reaction again
so I can't wear elf eyeshadows I don't
know what it is but it makes me very sad
because at least the mad format - I
thought was really good the first one
that I tried I did not think was very
good
the matte for my - I actually thought
was a really solid palette ten dollars
for ten shades I don't think that's a
bad price at all but for me personally
there's something in that formula that
does not get along well with my eyes I
will say that the the colors inside are
definitely pretty but it's docked you
know it's definitely a palette that's
been done a lot and all of that and
sometimes you just have to find the ones
like the dubious place like I know
that's been done but there are certain
reasons that pull me towards it where is
this elf one I mean
the biggest reason is because I won't be
able to wear it on my eyes so I purchase
it but there's some things that you're
like I know it's been done and I just
don't have any interest in it and that's
kind of how I feel about the elf one I
also got announced that Lady Gaga's
coming out with the cosmetic Glide why
not that's what everybody's doing right
now okay I don't think we really have a
lot to go off of right now it just says
she's coming out their own cosmetics
line called house beauty H a us beauty
it says there's gonna be foundations
eyeliner shadows pencils bronzers
highlighters cheek colors brah points I
mean there's gonna be like everything in
here hand cream nail polish a product
called Beauty milks perfume Body Gel I
mean it's like a whole shebang which is
quite crazy um you know for a brand new
line to drop all of that under the Sun I
mean that's pretty intense I'll
definitely be curious of what she's
gonna come out with and what cause what
calls my attention and all of that I was
getting a lot of tags on it I mean I
don't really have much to go off of yet
I do like Lady gaga
I think that she's pretty cool I've been
into her music for I mean I can remember
back in college the pokerface song came
out and that was pretty fun um I don't
know I mean her I feel like if we don't
get something that's like super creative
and just like kind of out there with our
products I would be really surprised cuz
that's just kind of what we've come to
expect from Lady gaga
I know there's definitely times that
she's tamed it down quite a bit but I
still like when I think Lady Gaga like I
think over-the-top music videos the meat
dresses I mean I think of all these
different crazy things so that's kind of
what I'm expecting from her line but
I'll be curious to see what it is and
all that fun stuff
okay Cosmetics it's coming out with a
new highlighter this is called the Becca
royal glow it says it's gonna be 30
euros and it's available exclusively
online at John Lewis retail weird I'm
not familiar with um so that's
interesting um oh it does say it's
coming soon to beauty beauty lush as
well okay okay cuz I'm not sure I'm not
familiar with John Lewis retail but
Beauty Alicia I'm familiar with this
looks super cute I don't know who else
is
for the royal wedding I feel like
sometimes when you bring up the Royals
like some people are like I bought the
Royals and I'm so obsessed and other
people are like the Royals are stupid
and you should not follow them I like
them and stuff it's like kind of one of
those topics that I don't really like to
throw out there but for me personally I
mean I do live in the United States but
it just seems like there's a lot of
people over here that have like this
deep fascination with the Royals and I'm
definitely one of them who is watching
the Royal Wedding I'm pretty excited for
it not gonna lie so I think this is
really cute I think it's a very I don't
know I don't know if it has anything to
do with like the Royals being in the
news lately with the new baby and not
the wedding but I feel like the timing
of it is fantastic and all of that it
looks really beautiful and I like I kind
of want it just because of the packaging
but Becca highlights are you know $38
which is super expensive and it's like
should you get something for that I have
a lot of Becca highlights as it is I'm
gonna try to stay strong and say no to
this one but I don't know my resolve
might weaken might weaken just a little
bit I also did place at my first beauty
Alysha order I'll have a haul video
coming up in just a couple days here but
I was so impressed with bootylicious how
fast my order came how cute everything
was like a wrapped and packaged in there
like it makes Sephora looks so
incredibly shameful that you know when
you ship from Sephora you get your
products with like that brown crinkly
paper thrown on top and as far as like
hope nothing broke and beauty lush like
wraps everything like it's ribbons on it
and stuff I'm like geez what is this so
I don't know you know maybe if I'm gonna
like order something from Beauty lish
and all of a sudden I'm I hear a whisper
of like like maybe I'll get it I don't
know what's up see what happens another
new product this is pretty interesting
so KL polish is launching an almond hand
cream it's gonna be $12 kale polish was
a nail polish brand those started by
kathleenlights who is a youtuber and so
far they've only put out nail polishes
and so they have a new product so that's
kind of interesting so the hand cream is
gonna be $12 and it'll be available on
May 15th
I believe you can just get kale polish
on the kale
website I will say a hand cream is not
something that interests me I I don't
even know the last time I thought a hand
cream like if I get like little minis in
anything like that just excites me
enough and I'm good with that I just
very rarely use them especially I need
them more in the winter time when I'm
super dry and like my skin is flaking
off but as we approach the warmer months
like a hand cream it's like the last
thing but I feel like I need and a lot
of times if I do feel like my hands need
a little bit of moisture I typically
just grab like the body lotion that I
use once I get out of the shower and I'm
good with it so this isn't really a
product that I feel like I need or I
have a lot of interest in but you know
let us know if you're planning to pick
that up I know a lot of people really
enjoy their hand creams another new
product here is from glossier
so they just launched their first
mascara this is the lash slick and it
says it curls and sculpts as it
lengthens enhancing the look of your
natural lashes instead of clumping them
together
it says teeny tiny fibers coat lashes
from root to tip to create lengthened
baby extension while flexible film
forming polymers lift and lock each
fiber into place ok this is water
resistant but not waterproof so it'll
wash off easily I'm so what was the
price on this did it tell me oh I'm not
sure the price it doesn't say it on here
okay but it does say it's available now
well let's just go ahead to the glossier
website I think is it I think it's just
glossy a website that sells their
products so okay so this is very strange
I just googled glossy and mascara to
find the price of it and the very first
things that are popping up is if you
order glossy as mascara you might be
getting a refund glossy a refunds
customers from mascara it claimed was
vegan does the mascara was label as
vegan due to the fact it was made with
vegan biotin sorry I'm totally getting
off on this but I didn't know getting
off on a tangent not gonna you know what
I mean oh so it has beeswax in it which
means that's not vegan so a lot of
people are apparently are not
oh it says this is from glossier it says
unfortunately this morning when
fortunately made a copy mistake in
labeling this mascara is vegan and are
writing to let you know that lash like
it's actually not vegan vegan vegan so
it's a six
dollar mascara um that price doesn't
freak me out I probably will not be
getting this one though because I don't
purchase a lot from the glossier
like not just the glossy a website but I
you know I have my typically purchased
from Sephora and also now Beauty lish is
gonna be right up there and all that fun
stuff if I was gonna be purchasing other
items from glossier like maybe I would
sneak this one into my bag but I
actually want to still purchase that
milk makeup the cush mascara I'm kind of
more interested in that one right now I
wash kathleenlights review of it and she
seemed that she liked it as well so I
think if I'm gonna be purchasing in
mascara which I don't purchase mascaras
a lot because I wear false lashes a ton
I would go for that over this one from
glossier but um okay well that was
interesting to learn I didn't know that
there was a bit of a scandal behind that
but that's a bummer getting quite a few
tags on a new pellet from makeup
revolution in collaboration with a
makeup by Tammy this is the tropical
paradise palette and has 23 shades and
matte and shimmer and it is going to be
$15 that's a pretty freakin phenomenal
price the swatches look really pretty I
can't say I'm familiar with makeup by
Tami but that's okay let us know in the
comments if you absolutely love her
she's just one of your favorites and the
palette looks cool like I mean it looks
cool and interesting and all that
there's a lot of different shades in
here but it doesn't give me a pull
you know makeup revolution or revolution
Beauty I think they were going through a
bit of a rebranding I'm not they're not
a brand that I have a ton from or that
I've tried a ton from I really do like
their highlights like they're baked
vivid highlights or something like that
I really do like those but other than
that I don't have a ton from the brand
and I think for this palette it just
didn't pull me enough to be able to
consider purchasing it I do think it
looks pretty and obviously it's very
affordable I just don't think it's gonna
be for me personally but let us know if
you're super excited about that and
you're planning to pick it up there's a
new skincare item I got a ton of tags on
this one as well because it's from Lula
Hendrickson one of my favorite brands ok
so it says they're coming out with a new
a face mask this is the cold plunge a
pore mask inspired by the
will plunge part of a sauna cycle in
Scandinavia whoa this cooling mask
deeply purifies and diminishes pores
with an exhilarating chill one of my
favorite products from Ulla Hendrickson
is the the pour sauna facial scrub it's
in my shower right now I have the mini
purchasable size I love it and it's
really cool because it goes on hot butt
washes off cold I'm very interested in
this one especially if it's supposed to
be good for your pores because I have
some pretty big pores here on my chin or
on my chin on my cheek hello help me
okay I'm pretty interested in this one
it says it's $36 and it has three ounces
of product it's supposed to instantly
reduce the appearance of pores it's also
supposed to reduce oil for up to eight
hours so if you're oily that could be
good it's supposed to even skin texture
and detoxify and purify the skin it
should be available May 17th on their
website and in Sephora and Sephora and
then in stores June 1st I'll probably
pick this up to try it I mean once I
find a brand that I am super loyal to
especially when it comes to skincare
like I I just want like all their
products and this sounds like something
I would really like especially because
of that pore like the pore minimizing
hmm okay hi tells you we have some more
to get through this week is just crazy
okay so hooda beauty is coming out with
a new eyeshadow palette
ish this is the rose rose gold
remastered palette it says on trend
Moochie was gone but not for long so
it's the rose gold palette it's back but
it has a new formula and the the
packaging now includes a mirror so the
original rose gold it didn't have a
mirror and I know a lot of people who
were quite upset about that so it looks
like they gave the packaging of boost
and they also you know reformulate it
and it'll be available may 22nd I think
that's pretty I think that's smart and
good I'm kind of getting a vibe from
trend mood that people aren't very
excited about it they're kind of like
frustrated by it but I feel like when it
came to that palette and her other big
palette a lot of people were not super
like wowed by the formula but a lot of
people liked the colors and stuff so I
think it's kind of cool I don't know I
think it's a good thing that she
apparently was listening and redid the
formulas and put a mirror on it because
I know a lot of people because I think
it was like a $65 palette which I
couldn't find the price
this one but I'm assuming maybe it's
gonna be around that or maybe a little
higher if it's supposed to be better um
but I think that's nice that the brand
listened and took that I know some
people are like oh I'm bored and this
palette was already out but maybe if you
were like me I ended up not getting that
palette because I was starting to hear
the reviews and people saying it's not
worth it it's not worth the price tag
you know now maybe if it's supposed to
be better more people would be
interested in picking it up I I don't
hate the idea I'm still not gonna
purchase it myself especially if it's in
the $60 range and honestly I mean that's
just kind of expensive I do love these
tones for sure but I love the hood of
mini palettes like I'm fine with those
truly I'm fine with those I still want
to pick up the coral one I have three
other ones and I am super happy with
those I kind of like more condensed
pellets like that I just feel like it's
easier for me with mine um creative mind
I know kind of what I'm gonna do when I
reach into these little palettes I think
it's perfect they're great for travel
and you know this palette is quite large
and all of that and it's kind of
overwhelming looking at all the
different shades and what I would create
but I think it's cool that you know they
listened to the feedback and and create
it something that hopefully is gonna be
a little bit better but it's still not
gonna be enough for me to purchase it if
that makes sense and then dose of colors
is coming out with some new with a new
product these are called the block party
so it's a new eyeshadow collection and
there's going to be 20 different singles
and they're each $20 it's gonna be
available May 19th on their website dose
colors is also available at Ulta but I'm
not sure before sure if they will be
coming in to Ulta so these look really
interesting but right off the bat I'm
like 20 dollars for a single eyeshadow
is pretty darn expensive for me I would
rather buy a palette you know I can buy
those who develops that have nine shades
right nine shades and its $27 you know
and also with Joseph's colors I
purchased one of their ideal do Louis
ones which i think was like 24 or 25
dollars and it had like a loose pigment
on top and then kind of like your kind
of like base on the bottom and I
actually really didn't like it and that
was kind of a waste of money for me so
when I see this like my mind kind of
went to that and I don't know it just
boils down to twenty dollars for a
single shade they look really cool
obviously there's quite a bit of like
neutrals in there there's not as many
like colorful shadows as maybe I would
have expected to see for single shadows
you know I know not a lot of people put
together full colorful palettes but for
singles I don't know I kind of maybe
thought there would be more it's more
definitely more neutral base but I just
would not be able to justify the $20 for
it so I'm gonna be passing over these
but would love to know if you guys are
interested in this one and you're super
excited for these okay I feel like I'm
talking superfast but we still have some
we still products to go through what is
going on here so many new releases I
also got a lot of tags on this new one a
new product from Mark beauty it's the
colos stick it's a gloss but it is in a
bullet and it's a soft solid stick says
it'll be available May 31st on their
website and online at Sephora Neiman
Marcus and then it's also gonna be
coming into stores in June I don't see a
price on it right now I'm sure it's
gonna be expensive because most mark lip
products mark beauty lip products are in
the $30 range I have to say I'm curious
I'm curious about it I think this is
gonna be something that I would like to
see reviews on just because I'm I'm
trying to like figure out what it is in
my mind and I'm assuming it's gonna go
on your lips glossy but like I'm not
100% I would like to see reviews of it
first
especially because it'll probably be
more expensive but Marc Jacobs Beauty
has some of my favorite lip products and
I know that they are more expensive but
so I mean from the high Namur glosses
the Lamarck lip cremes the liquid lip
creme i'm fans of all of them so I don't
know this is one I'm gonna wait on the
reviews for it but if people start
saying that it's really good I'm seeing
I would probably buy it that's crazy
there's I feel like this weekend was
like well why don't okay okay
Tarte cosmetics has a new collaboration
release so this is with Aspen Oh bard
and it is a eye and cheek palette it's
gonna be $39 I believe it is available
now so I will have it linked down below
honestly I'm I'm not super familiar with
Aspen over art I am a little bit with
her claps that she did with pixie beauty
I think this palette from from what
I gather from her is a very her palette
which you would expect with a
collaboration but for me it's just gonna
be a little bit too on the plain side
for me I try not to use the word boring
because I feel like that can get a
little bit offensive but it is a little
plain for me looking at it I I can
recall you know several pallets that I
feel like would have the same eye shades
in there
I do like that it has the face shades as
well and I like palettes like that a lot
I like iron face palettes but it's just
not going to be enough to intrigue me
the packaging is super pretty on it and
I'm also I'm still not buying from Tarte
at the moment they're just I don't know
I'm just not really feeling some of the
vibes that they are putting out but at
the final final item that we're going to
be talking about is some new releases
are from a Fendi beauty so they're beach
please is their Summer 2018 collection
so they have a kilowatt foil freestyle
duo to be used on the eyes cheeks and
lips and they also have summer days
iridescent lip Luminizer trio there's
three in each set and there's also the
island bling two and one liquid eyes
shimmer which are liquid eye shadows I
think it says that everything is going
to be a limited edition from what I can
tell it's all going to be available May
21st at Sephora I don't see prices on
this trend mood post if I see it by the
time I put this video up I'll go ahead
and leave them linked down below the
liquid eye shadows I'm not interested in
I'm just not interested in that style of
that formula of eyeshadows unless we're
talking about the Stila glitters because
then I am I have the new one on my eyes
today and I think it's so beautiful the
iridescent lip Luminizer trio not really
my vibe either I would go ahead and pass
over them but the kilowatt foil free
style of duos I am very curious about
especially the shade mimosa sunrise
slash sangria sunset it's the gold and
it looks like a purple pink I'll try to
insert a photo of just that one here I
am very curious about this one I think
it looks super beautiful I think it
looks so fun for the summer and this
my attention pretty darn hard I think
there's three different yeah there's
there's three different ones and
honestly I think I think it's just that
one that's really calling my attention I
think I kind of want to try that one out
so what do you guys think about sentence
new summer collection um you know they
have some of the products that that's
already released you know like the body
glow that everyone's using and you know
that fun stuff but that duo there I
think just on the eyes I think I would
use it on my eyes I know it says you can
use on your cheeks and your lips as well
I'm picturing it for eyeshadow and I
think it would be super beautiful so
that's what I'm interested in from the
Fenty's Summer 2018 collection I would
love to know what you were interested in
