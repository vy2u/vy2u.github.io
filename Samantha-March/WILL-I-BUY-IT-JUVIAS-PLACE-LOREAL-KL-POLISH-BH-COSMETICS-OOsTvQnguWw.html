today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my over like my videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them so I always have lots to say
in these videos so why don't we go ahead
and get started before we get started -
my office has been painted and I finally
get back to filming I had to take like
five days off of filming I think it was
while my husband and I worked on
redecorating my office so this is the
new color these are the new walls I'm
very excited about it unfortunately it
was you know super nice weather the
entire time we were painting and now
that I'm getting back into filming it's
storming and dark outside so that's
great I feel like I'm not even really
going to be able to judge which of my
videos they're gonna look like because I
had to pull my ring light out and I
typically only film with natural light
so that's a bummer the weather wants to
rain on this parade but that's fine but
to jump into it I do have a lot of
affordable makeup and makeup for hands
to chat about in this video which I'm
very excited about so the first one
we're going to talk about is a new
eyeshadow palette from BH Cosmetics it's
their Studio Pro ultimate artistry 42
color eyeshadow palette it's going to be
$19.99 reading from the trend with one
Instagram so her page will be linked
down below it says there's new
formulated metallic eyeshadows creamy
mattes soft shimmers in duochrome I
don't see a release date on it yet I am
filming the day before I post this video
so not sure if I'll have a release date
yet but it will be coming soon BH
Cosmetics is now sold in uLTA Beauty not
for sure I don't think everything is on
the Ulta website but a lot from BH is
sold on the Ulta online website which is
exciting so hopefully that will be
coming there I kind of know where it
went and pass over it I don't know if
you guys saw last week's will I buy a
video but I actually had four iron
shadow palettes featured in there
because there's a lot going on with the
eyeshadow palettes right now and I said
that I was going to be purchasing two of
the four that I talked about in that
video and then I do have another holiday
video coming up and the next you know
probably a week or so here I'm gonna be
talking about some holiday releases and
there's already some that
no I'm going to be buying said I know
for sure I don't need new eyeshadow
palettes and if you do follow me on
Instagram I've been trying some new
palettes that I got in I got in some
very exciting new eyeshadow palettes to
play with from a subscriber friend so I
definitely don't need any eyeshadow
palettes right now especially one with
42 shades that's a lot and a lot of them
seem to be like very colorful these hot
pinks purples greens blues I mean
there's a lot of colors in there and I
am a little bit more of a basic side
when it comes to my makeup but I mean
that's an awesome awesome price 42
eyeshadows for $20 that's crazy that's
insane I really do like BH Cosmetics and
I definitely owned a ton from BH when I
first really started getting its makeup
when I first started my youtube channel
I owned quite a few of the BH eyeshadow
palettes I also own and still do own
some of their makeup brushes and I
definitely do recommend the brand I
think that you're getting very good
quality for a very fantastic price
between everything that I know that I'm
going to be buying for myself in the
next couple of days and weeks here and
then coupled with the holiday items as
well I know that I do not need it I know
that I can say no so that's what I'm
gonna do for this new BH eyeshadow
palette next I've gotten a lot of
questions about some nail polish I get
asked a lot about kale polish and if I'm
buying nail polishes or own nail
polishes from that brand if you aren't
familiar with kale polish it's a nail
polish company started by kathleenlights
she is a really well-known at youtuber
and fairly recently she created Kol
polish and she's come out with quite a
variety of different nail polishes I do
have one nail polish it was sent to me
from my friend Danielle and it's in
snickerdoodle it's a really nice nude
and I really do like it I got along with
the formula and everything really well
and so I feel like every time Kevin puts
out a new collection I'm getting asked
quite a bit of questions but I felt like
especially for this fall collection that
she just released that I was getting a
lot of tags on it so I did want to touch
on it so I'm looking at the kale polish
website I'll leave it down below it's
just kale polish calm and by the nail
polishes separately or you can buy the
whole bundle has 6 of the different nail
polishes in there it's for $45 it says
it's limited edition I think that
just a boxset that's limited-edition you
can buy them each individually for $8.50
so when I was first thinking about this
I actually somehow talked myself into
buying the bundle I watched Kathleen's
video where she you know swatches all
the different nail polishes and there
were so many in there that I was really
hyped about that up like I'm just gonna
do it I'm gonna buy the collection you
know maybe I can give a nail polish to a
friend or put it in a giveaway if
there's one then I didn't want I
actually sat down and like thought about
what I do have in my nail polish
collection and then like what I want to
my polish collection I talked myself out
of buying the bundle because I didn't
think it would be necessary for me I
really enjoy nail polishes I have a
fairly big nail polish collection I
don't think it's like too extreme or
out-of-control but I buy a lot of nail
polishes and I really love nail polishes
I do have acrylics and I do get these
done at the salon but what I do is I
just go in and have them like do a fill
for me and then I come home with paint
my nails I like painting my nails I
enjoy it I like changing up my nail
polish color and whenever I get my nails
done at a salon like that nail polish
color doesn't come off until the next
time I go on the salon time they take it
off so I just like painting my nails at
home and luckily I go with the same nail
salon for a while now so they just know
like they've stopped questioning me do
you have quite a few shades because at
first I really wanted like the blue and
the purple in there I'm like I have like
I have a lot of blue and purple nail
polishes but the two that I'm most
excited about that I want to get the
first one is called Chloe and that's
like the olive green and shockingly
enough I did not have an olive nail
polish I have a couple different greens
but none of them are like that perfect
olive green that I really want so when I
saw this one I saw it on Kathleen in the
video and I've seen a couple of people
wearing it on snapchat I'm like yes that
is the one that is the one that I need
so I know that I want that one and then
the other one is called a Prince of
Cornelius this one was super super cool
so it's described as a shimmery bronze
like it almost has a lot of like a red
in it I think Kathleen described this as
like the one that she wants to wear on
Thanksgiving and I honestly did not
think I would ever like a shade like
this I
I think I have any shimmers in my
collection I can't recall any off the
top of my head I just don't wear those
colors a lot immediately gravitated
toward it in the video and then my
friend Kendall Alfred on her snapchat
the other day she's got her nails on and
she was showing her manicure and the
polish she had reminded me a lot of this
Prince Cornelius and it looks so good I
was like okay sold I'm gonna give both
so instead of buying the complete bundle
for $45 and you know having a couple of
shades in there that would be repaints
and those two that I wasn't super
interested in and think I'm just gonna
go ahead and purchase the Prince
Cornelius and Chloe at eight fifty each
but I'm excited because I feel like
these are two shades that I do not have
in shades that I would really be
attracted to especially right now
obviously this is a Fall collection but
I feel like they would be like perfect
fall nail shades so I'm really excited
about that but I would love to know how
have you guys tried any of the KL polish
nail polishes in the past are you gonna
pick up any from the fall collection or
have you already I'd love to know your
thoughts
next I have some new releases are from
L'Oreal I thought these are pretty eye
catching so L'Oreal is coming out with
some new items they have a glow kit with
five highlighters inside and then they
also have the galaxy Lumiere lip gloss
so that is super interesting it says
it'll be available just sometime in
October is what the trend mood Instagram
page is saying and L'Oreal can be found
an ad drugstores I'm also in Ulta places
like that so I feel like that's
interesting I feel like they're
definitely jumping on kind of this like
holographic type of trend that we're
seeing so much lately unfortunately the
trend isn't really for me these are not
my type of items that I love a lot but I
mean I think I think it's cool to see um
you know cool to see what the drugstore
brands are you know coming up with and
things like that so definitely the lip
glosses are just not gonna be for me you
know just even seeing them of the tubes
but then seeing like the lip swatches on
and everything it's just not what I wear
I'm just not interested in the
holographic trend I just I don't think
it looks good on me it's just a hard
pass so the the glow kits gave me a bit
of a double take because I'm a because
it's called glow kit I was like wait
what okay whoo but again I mean the
shades do look really cool I kind of
want to try it
to see how good it is you know what I'm
saying okay I kind of want to try it for
that reason but I did just do a
highlight declutter and so and I've been
on a highlight no buy for a long time
and I think I've broke it I think I've
bought either like two or three
highlighters so since being on a
highlight no buy I just a highlight
declutter I think that video was posted
yesterday so I'm like do I really want
to go buy another highlight and you know
it has all of these you know the
highlights the iridescent galaxy shades
as well and I just don't know if I would
need them and I think to try to try to
stick with my highlight no buy and to
try to be really proud of myself before
it was a very few highlighters that I de
cluttered let's be honest I didn't do
very great I think I'm gonna go ahead
and pass over it but I thought it was
interesting to see on new items that the
drugstore is coming out with us so I
would love to know your thoughts if
you're excited to see lore'l hopping in
on this holographic trend next and last
item and then I'm going to talk about is
an eyeshadow palette ooh look at that
this is from Julius place this is the
siharan to eyes shadow palette it's
going to be available October 15th and
it's gonna be $17.50 it's a 9 shade
eyeshadow palette so I do own one
Julius place palette it's the masquerade
mini and I think it's fantastic super
pigmented very long-lasting eyeshadows
that's one thing I definitely realized
about it the the eyeshadows are really
going to stick around the entire day
through anything
which is awesome 1750 for the 9 shades I
don't think that that's a bad price at
all and not a hundred percent in saying
if Julia's place is considered an
affordable brand but I feel like a lot
of what I see for them seem to be fairly
reasonably priced I don't know you can
let me know what you think in the in the
comments down below but I guess I didn't
get sticker shock when I saw 1750 I've
believed that the only place you can get
dubious place is on their website which
I'll leave link down below if you know
if there's other places to buy please do
let me know of course
so this one this one gave me a double
take for sure this one this one made me
think there's a lot of really beautiful
colors in here like there's a really
interesting looking to interesting
looking blues one really dark one and
one really
like one there's like a beautiful
cranberry shimmer right in the middle
and the top row looks like shimmers as
well but then we have these really nice
maths there's nothing that would be like
my perfect transition from what I can
tell from looking at the palette doing
the swatches and such I don't feel like
there's like my perfect transition in
there but I feel like the shades will
look really pretty so this one I had to
stop and think about because I did the
double take I was interested the shades
look pretty I know that Julius place has
really good quality eyeshadows I didn't
think 1750 would be a bad price but I
decided to pass over it mostly for what
I was saying in the beginning of the
video that I'm purchasing two eyeshadows
this week a couple things for holiday I
have a fun video coming up that I need
to purchase a couple different makeup
items for some of them are more
expensive so I know coming up here are
in the next couple of weeks I'm going to
be purchasing a lot makeup wise there's
also a lot clothing wise coming out
that's really exciting a couple of my
favorite youtubers are doing some fun
clothing
launches and releases and things like
that so I mine that really hard and then
of course you know the actual holidays
are coming up and everything that goes
into holiday time and gift-giving for
others and travel and you know all that
fun stuff so I talked myself out of it
for right now for right now but I think
this one's gonna like stay on my back
burner is gonna stay on my my wish list
I think because it really did catch my
attention and I think that I would
really enjoy it but I know with
everything else I'm gonna be purchasing
in the next couple weeks here that I can
at least hold off on it for right now if
that makes sense you know kind of like
spread out my purchases as best as I can
but I think that is going to be my plan
so skip over for right now but I think
I'm interested in getting this one
sometimes the dubious place palettes are
a little bit like too colorful and too
like BAM for me because I'm you know I'm
much more of like the neutral girl the
warm toned girl I'm not super colorful
but this one really did catch my
attention because I feel like I could
make this one work for me from dubious
places so I think that's why I know the
reason why I got so excited for it but I
still think that I can say no right now
to it but let us know do you love the
dubious place I shadow paladin Oh which
one is your favorite one or if you're
planning on getting this
hard to palate then after that that's
gonna do it for this week so will I buy
a video so that is everything for this
week's that will I buy a video I really
hope that you enjoyed this video or
found it helpful in some way I really
wish the weather could have been better
because I feel like my first video back
in my new office isn't as like bright
and cheery as I wanted it to be because
these darn storms but that's okay I know
that I'm gonna have to work out like the
settings on my camera and stuff as well
I'm going from such a dark deep red
background to the slider shade I know
I'm gonna have to like mess around with
the settings on there too so if anybody
has any sony a 5100 tips that you want
to offer to me I would gladly take them
because I don't understand camera
settings for the life of me I do like a
little office tour slash you know seeing
my makeup collection and how I organized
it after the remodel and everything so I
think that will be coming up in the next
few weeks if you guys would be
interested in that video please do let
me know but as always of my Villa bite

of everything in the comments down below
