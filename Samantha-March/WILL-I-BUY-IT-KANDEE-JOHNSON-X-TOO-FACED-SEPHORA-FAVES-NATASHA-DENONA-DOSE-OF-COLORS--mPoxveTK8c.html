today's video is going to be a new will
i buy it video I post my roller type
videos every single Wednesday when I'm
talking about
new makeup releases and then you guys
know I will be buying them why or why
not
and a little bit about each of the
products like I said I do post these
videos every single Wednesday I do have
a will I buy a playlist I will leave a
link down below and in addition to my
Wednesday videos I also post on
Thursdays Sundays and Mondays so I
really hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button becoming a
part of this damn getting notified
hopefully will have my videos go live
but I do always have less to talk about
in my bullabbai videos so let me go
ahead and get started I got a couple
tags on the new dose of colors
highlighters those of colors has
released a few new supreme glow
highlighters in royal hotness dream on
milk and honey melon aid and I see you
baby
the cruelty free gluten free talc free
there $28 each and they can be found at
the dose of colors website so of course
I'm going to be passing over these
because I keep mentioning how I went a
little crazy with highlighters I went to
like highlight overload for a while
there when all the companies were coming
out with new highlighters and I do not
need any I'm like on a highlighter no
buy at this moment and I've never still
ordered from dose of color so since so
many times or I almost have because I
really want to try out their liquid
lipsticks I almost bought some of our
eyeshadow palettes
but I still just have not done it and I
just I don't think the first thing that
I need from dose of colors is going to
be highlighters especially because I
have so many highlighters right now and
I have so many that have become like
absolute favorites they're like all that
I want to wear that I'm kind of
forgetting about the other one colors
definitely do look fun and there's like
some pretty unique ones in there like
very bronzy almost like orgy some of
them look like holographic pinks and
yellows and pearl shades and all that
fun stuff so I mean they definitely look
cool $28 for one highlighter I think is
spray see because I spent 35 on my Casey
Holmes pearl palette and it was $35 for
three highlights and I used that sucker
so much I absolutely loved that palette
so to spend twenty eight dollars on one
highlight
also offensive right now especially with
my highlighter know by need to you think
illogically need to be smart about my
medical purchases right now especially
after that vib fail my Hall will be
linked down below but I'm definitely
gonna be passing over the dose of colors
new highlighters that let us know in the
comments down below
do you love dose of colors and you need
to get all of their releases have you
tried their highlighters at all what do
you think them are you going to be
picking up with these new shades let us
know in the comments down below right I
got a lot of tags on this Natasha de
nada
i shadow pellet and I've actually been
getting tagged for a while I was just
talking about Natasha de nada not too
long ago about her sculpt and glow
palette I think is what it was so I was
trying to wait a little bit but still
people are still tagging me asking me if
I'm going to get her sunset palette
it looks very gorgeous so it's the
sunset palette it is limited edition 129
dollars oh it will be available may 12
online and beauty listen to flora and in
some select stores again I'm reading
from the trend mood Instagram and I
typically try to always link for example
expecting read from her page a lot I go
to her Instagram like 20 million times a
day to see what's going on so I get a
lot of my information from her and
sometimes I do have the photos from her
so she's always linked in the
description box down below I always
worked mind checking out her Instagram
so know like I'm sorry I'm so sorry I
know a lot of people love Natasha de
Nonna and have an amazing thing to say
about her eye shadow palette but I just
can't I just can't spend 129 dollars on
an eyeshadow palette I can't I talked
about the lorac and Pirates of the
Caribbean
I showed a palette in a few will i buy
videos back and it was $52 and I was
like I just wanted so bad but I don't
know if I can pay $52 and I was super
sweet because Allah rocks on my video
and send me the collection and I like
cried tears of happiness that's a very
true story I did cry tears of happiness
but also suppose like oh my gosh now I
just have to spend fifty-two dollars
cause I was really going to buy it I'm
going to use my all the points but still
it's just a lot of money guys and I just
I just can't do it
I mean it looks so cool though the
swatches look gorgeous it's called the
sunset
I mean the name it definitely makes
sense the oranges and the yellows kind
of burgundy shades I had to look
gorgeous it looks beautiful I would love
to have this palette I would love to
have a Natasha to Nona palette I would
love to try it out and let you guys know
is it worth 129 dollars but I don't go
to 129 dollars to send on an eyeshadow
palette okay
like I'm gearing up for another book
release here and that that cost a lot of
money is not cheap to put up you guys
and then you turn around and film for
three dollars so no I'm going to need to
save my money and I know I'm going to
need to save my money but it looks
gorgeous you know I'll have the photo
inserted down here below and like I said
I hear a lot of really good things about
the Natasha eyeshadows I like that
they're in Sephora now I like that she's
being carried in there because I love
the Sephora rewards and all that I
really do want to place an order with
Beauty lish sometime soon and maybe do a
beauty look haul because they hear a lot
of really good things about that site
and I know they have some brands on
there that aren't carried in stores but
no I can't do it guys I'm so sorry but
I'm going to have to pass over the
sunset palette from Natasha to donut it
looks very gorgeous would totally love
to have it but I just know for the price
tag it's a big ol no for me but let us
know in the comments down below are you
a huge Natasha Danone a junkie have you
tried her eyeshadow palettes are they
worth the high price tag are you going
to get the sunset palette like are you
so pumped for this one let us know in
the comments down below I would love to
hear your feedback on that said have no
idea how much I love like how well my
social media family seems to know me it
just when I get tags and comments on
things and we either have like an
instant joke with one another or you
guys tag me on something you're like oh
it's because I know that you would love
this it it gives me such a weird like
feeling every single time I was like oh
my gosh these people really do listen to
me and they like remember things about
me like it's just like it's really weird
it's really weird feeling for me to
describe but it's just so cool and it
was just today just like 20 minutes ago
I got a tag on Instagram because before
I came out with one of their new Sephora
favorites collections and I don't know
if I've ever talked about Sephora
our collection in a well I buy it video
and I don't know why because I really
love them I do have a video running
right now with a two-person giveaway in
there for the Sephora favorites give me
some new books collection they just came
out with a new nude lip collection so I
do swatches of all of that and then I
have two extra ones that I'm giving away
so make sure to check that out it'll be
listed down below
I love the sephora favorites I'm a big
fan of them and I realized like the tag
just came in a couple minutes ago and I
was like oh my gosh I should talk about
these in a lullabye video why have I
never like thought of that type of
pre-filming in case you guys are like
almost matching like one second she was
talking about that like last week I am
getting a wisdom tooth extracted so I
need to be prefilling videos to make
sure just in case I'm super swollen or
super in pain and don't want to talk or
do my makeup or whatever I'm trying to
pre film as much as much as I can just
in case I need to take a couple days off
or more days off than I planned so then
I'm filming is the day that it was
released and this is the sun kissed glow
set and i was super stoked to see this
so the sun kissed glow set is $45 and it
has nine different items inside three
items or full-size and six items are
deluxe sized so inside you get the Becca
cosmetics shimmering skin Perfector in
opal hourglass ambient lighting bronzer
and luminous bronze light the Laura
Mercier foundation primer radiance the
Marc duty high liner gel eye crayon in
rokoko
the milk makeup liquid strobe and beam
narcissus lip gloss and orgasm Tarte
cosmetics Brazilians plus self-tanner
and mitt Too Faced chocolate Soleil
matte bronzer and medium deep in Urban
Decay's iconic eye shadow and half-baked
are you kidding me for $45 I'm like why
I'd love the support favorite
collections they're always so so
freaking good I'm all about like
bronzers and highlighters like this when
someone said like you know I saw this
and I thought of you as like I saw three
two one that I believe there's the three
full-size and I'm like for sure that the
mark um the Marc Jacobs highlighter is
because I looked at those grams that is
listed and it's the same so I already on
three
I want several more I absolutely love
them I don't have the real Coco yet so
that makes me like super excited say I
think it's the tart I think they're
Tanner and the mint are full-sized and
then I thought maybe like the Laura
Mercier foundation primer maybe that one
was the full size too but I'm not for
sure and it doesn't list it on the
Sephora site sometimes it says in there
what's the full size and it just dropped
today so there's no reviews yet or
anything like that
but I will have it listed in the
description box down below because I'm
sure by the time I'm filming so far in
advance I'm sure by the time this video
goes live I'll know for sure so I will
have it in the description box down
below remember everything is always in
the description box because there's ever
anything I can't say and while I buy a
video like prices or things like that or
launch dates whatever I have everything
listed and linked in the description box
my makeup will always be in there like
outfit accessories anything like that I
always have all of that in the
description box but back to the Sephora
favorites set this had me so excited
when I saw the tag come in and I went
looked it up I immediately went off
before it was like whoa Nelly
I have not bought it yes because when I
started of setting up my camera and
getting ready and I'm trying to decide
if I should just buy one for myself
should I buy a couple extras I need to
check it out I need to look on ebay and
you see what the cash that gifts for
Sephora
but I'm super stoked about this one and
I'm fairly confident I need it I was
going to try to go on a no-buy I really
was after the VIP fill and then this
came out and I'm like Sephora why are
you playing with me but the Marc Jacobs
eyeliner that's like a 20 was the $25
eyeliner pen so that's super expensive I
wanted to try the Tarte tanner so that
would be awesome
I've always wanted to try the hourglass
ambient lighting I've talked about him
in the past and bullabbai videos and I
said I would like to try them but
they're just expensive so this would be
such an awesome way to be able to try it
out the Urban Decay eyeshadow I was
about to try I do have the Too Faced
bronzer and I do have the Becca opal I
have those but the NARS lip gloss I
could try that too and there was a milk
makeup a liquid strobe yeah I would like
to try that too yeah pretty sure I'm
going to need to get this it just has so
many things that I would absolutely love
to try
what I really love about Sephora
favorites is that you get to try a
variety of different items and brands
and see what you love a lot of times
especially with like the lip collections
that they come out with I try a lipstick
that maybe I wouldn't necessarily have
bought or tried out myself
and I realized that I love it and then I
go in five full sizes and different
colors and shades and things like that
so yeah I think this said I feel like it
was like made for me you need to get it
and I'm pretty darn excited about it so
that's the sun kissed glow set $45 in
the sephora favorites collection I'll
have it linked down below sometimes it
can go out of stock so I recommend if
you do want to get it make sure you pick
it up but yeah and they get need that
one the last item that I want to talk
about I've been getting so many texts
and questions about and I haven't really
been wanting to chat about it yet
because it's not releasing until
September so I don't really understand
why there's like all these posts and
promotions about it already and just
chatter about it I don't appreciate when
brands release something five minutes
before goes on sale and you know it's a
bit of an exaggeration but not giving us
enough time to like actually look into
it do we need it you know have any sort
of reviews about or anything but I also
don't really understand what's going on
with this Too Faced and candy Johnson
colors like it's coming out in September
but everyone keeps asking me about it so
I thought I would put it in here just to
like throw it in here but I'll probably
try to chat about it again when it
actually releases because usually when
I'm talking about the makeup product
they're coming out fairly shortly maybe
it's a week of the will I buy it maybe
the following ways I just launched when
the whaling biologist and getting so
many texts on this sound like okay I
need to put it in a will I buy a video
so here we go we're going to talk about
the Too Faced and candy Johnson collab
your face is teaming up with candy
Johnson who believe it is a beauty
influencer and actually do not follow
candy Johnson I think she's like a huge
huge name though let me know if you guys
follow her do I need to start watching
her videos you know there's just so many
like beauty influencers out there that's
so impossible to watch everybody but let
me know I always love to hear from you
guys they have a really big collection
coming out and include
I shadow palettes banana pudding which
is a face powder to brighten the face
candy globe Luminizer which is a
highlighter stick there's going to be
new melted matte lippies in four
different shades and there's also going
to be a black licorice o liquid eyeliner
and it says it'll be available September
3rd online at Ulta beauty and to face
let's chat about this so I have
mentioned in a lot of my will i buy
videos for several months now that I am
in a complicated relationship with Too
Faced ever since the white chocolate
chip palette came out it's like just
something in me like shift it with Too
Faced and I started kind of paying
attention more to what the brand was
doing and just things like that that I
might not have always have paid
attention to all of our past releases
have not been great like just me
personally I know a lot of people really
love to face to face was the first
high-end I shadow palette that I bought
like I've always really liked to face
and gone back to to face with the primed
and poreless primer was my first
high-end primer like I was immediately
attracted to the Too Faced brand way
back before YouTube before I watched
YouTube before any of that feel like
lately I don't know what they're doing
and I don't know so many releases are
just like falling short and there's so
many unhappy people and their releases
are weird like the launches are not
going smoothly either and there's new
drama this week with Too Faced and I'm
not a drama channel I don't watch drama
channels because but it's just not my
cup of tea personally but I am in a lot
of like forums and beauty forums and
I've been seeing the chatter about it I
haven't watched the toothpaste nap chat
I haven't watched Jeff or Sarah shot
snapchats
I haven't really understood what is
going on fully because I just I don't
want to engage in that kind of stuff
because it's just not my style but I
have an idea of what is going on and
that makes me really sad I understand
what's going on with your face as a
whole and it's just made me not want to
purchase from them even more a lot of
comments when I talk about not wanting
to support from people are certain
brands for the behavior
that I see on social media and things
like that and people are saying well
like well you don't know the order of
Nicks and you don't know what they do
you don't know the wonder of this brand
or that brand and that's true but maybe
they choose not to put themselves on
social media for that reason and other
people do shoes to put themselves in
social media and that means that we do
get to see them and then we do get to
make our own decisions from there so
that's just what I have to judge it off
of and just from what I have been seeing
lately from Too Faced and it's not just
what it's been seeing from Too Faced I
have bought the new releases from them
and I have been so underwhelmed return
to the makeup you know so it's not just
because of these other things that are
happening I'm buying the products too
and I'm not happy with them at all not
even keeping them in my collection like
just boom doggie get out of here I just
recently tried like one of their two
face like glossy lip injections and that
was in my sephora favorites video and
that was horrible horrible I couldn't
even keep it on my lips I felt like my
lips were on fire it was like bizarre
like to face is just not doing anything
for me lately and makeup wise and then
when you add in all the other extra
stuff that's going on I'm just
disappointed and it just makes me not
really want to purchase from them I
think if I was a huge candy Johnson
supporter I still would probably buy
this like it's your face is teaming up
with one of my favorite like writer dye
youtubers that I feel very passionately
about I would highly consider buying it
I don't know if I would be able to
though I would consider it but I don't
know if I'd be able to do it but because
I'm not a huge supporter of candy
Johnson I do not feel like I need this
collection I don't feel like a lot of
the things in the collection are going
to be for me and a putting brightening
face powder I don't think I was like you
know like maybe the melted mask I might
like the liquid eyeliner says it has a
unique tip but I don't think I've seen
what the tip looks like yet but that's
probably going to be a no-go for me if
the palette just looks like like an
eyeshadow palette I was like there's
nothing in here that makes me super so
super excited a highlighting stick I
don't need one of those so it's not it's
not a collection that I need to buy
either and and also they're just my
thoughts on
it and I just kind of want to talk some
more I just I get a lot of comments when
I say things about I'm not flying for
this reason or that reason then people
come after me for it you guys have to
remember that I get to do what I want to
do with my money just because I'm saying
this it doesn't mean that you have to
follow it if you want every single
collection and every single launch that
two-face puts out then you guys go ahead
and buy it and I'm not judging you for
that and other people shouldn't judge it
but just because I have my opinions and
what I choose to do doesn't make me
wrong it just makes me me and we get to
make our own decisions I'm not going to
be pressured into buying something that
I don't want or drunk need or don't want
to support because people think about I
should think a different way that
doesn't make any sense
so that just my feelings on that and
something that I wanted to explain
because I get really bothered when
people try to persuade me or tell me
that my opinions are wrong I will never
tell someone that their opinion is wrong
if you love the toothpaste so I shall
let you tell it that's fantastic I'm so
happy it worked for you a lot of times
in the comments if I review something
and I don't love it people are like
you're crazy I absolutely love it I
write back I'm still happy it worked for
you that's fantastic it worked for you
that's awesome so happy it worked for
you we're all different we have
different wants and needs with our
makeup and put our beauty and it doesn't
make anybody wrong so that's what I want
to say but I was just getting so many
tags on it and even though it's not
coming out for September I don't really
understand why there's almost like hype
around it because it's like what are we
supposed to be doing about it right now
but it's coming out September 3rd so
maybe around September maybe I'll talk
about it again and gives like more
updates and things like that I don't
think we even have any prices I'll try
to insert in here the best photos that I
can get but I don't see any prices right
now if something comes out within the
next week or so I can put them at the
description box but again this isn't
even coming out until September so we
have a long time to wait for this
collection
I appreciate that they're not doing like
a real quick launch and we have to
decide real fast because I don't like
that but several months pretty extreme
in my opinion but at this moment I
believe that I will be passing over the
full toothpaste and Katie Johnson
collection I'd love to know your
thoughts in the comments down below let
me know what you think about this
collection what you think about candy
Johnson is she one of your favorites
