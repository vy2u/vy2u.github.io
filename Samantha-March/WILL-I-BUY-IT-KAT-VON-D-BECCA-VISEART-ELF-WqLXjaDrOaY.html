today's video is gonna be a new will I
buy it I post my rollabout videos every
single Wednesday where I'm chatting
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then also talking over if
I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them and as always I have a lot to
chat about this week so I'm gonna go
ahead and get started alright a first
time do not mind the lashes I'm trying
some new lashes today and they just did
not want to go on every time I try
lashes from this brand they just don't
seem to work out for me which makes me
really sad but I thought I'd killed my
mother try today and we looked a little
crazy but that's does besides a point
but to jump into it I got some tags on a
new collaboration between elf cosmetics
and Christian Siriano who I believe is a
fashion designer I think he was
discovered on that show with the fashion
designers you know Project Runway is
that what it is
I think that's one of this so he is a
fashion designer but is doing a
collaboration with elf
it has a pellet in there for $12 which
has a shadows and a highlighter also
matte liquid lipsticks for 750 each
tinted lip oil for $6 and then a makeup
bag for $8 and I believe it is already
for sale so I will have some links down
below and I am reading from the children
one Instagram so I will have her
Instagram page a link down below like I
normally do in my life I have videos as
well so I'll say just kind of starting
off like it didn't really catch my
attention right away and I even flagged
it when I was getting tags on it so I
like marked it so I could come back to
it and each time I was going through
trend moods
Instagram page I kept passing over it
because it wasn't like it didn't catch
my attention and for some reason I just
I just kept scrolling right by it and
finally I found it and I was like oh
yeah it's because I don't know it just
didn't just even the photos don't call
out to me it doesn't very springy kind
of like these bright colors and pink
into all of that but I mean it's just
nothing really called out to me the
eyeshadow palette looks like it does
have a brush and $12 I mean of course
for an eyeshadow palette from ELF that's
a great price there's a blue in there
agreeing a pink it looks fun but I just
don't feel like I
you would need this one and beep matte
lipsticks a tinted lip oil I just got
actually a couple up to Detlef oils from
covergirl they just came out with new
ones matte lipsticks I just don't feel
like I need a makeup bag I definitely
don't need I just tried it declutter my
makeup bags the other day because I
always get some money with like
especially with FC bags and things like
that I have a lot of makeup bag so I
just don't feel like anything really
calls out to me in this collection or
there's anything that I necessarily even
need or want right now from the
collection and also I'm just not super
familiar with Christian Siriano and
sometimes with collabs does anybody else
ever feel like some collabs just feel
like really random and I mean make there
probably is a story out there that I do
not know of why Christian Siriano teamed
up with elf there's probably a reason
behind that and if somebody knows you
can for sure share it because as always
I do not know absolutely everything out
there I know that might be a little
shocking but I don't know absolutely
everything but when I saw that
collaboration I was kind of like what it
does it's interesting to see
collaborations and who is collaborating
with brands but then sometimes I'm like
I'm not sure I fully get it and this was
one that I was like hmm that's kind of
interesting but I mean if probably if
you're a huge fan of Christian Siriano
I could see wanting to grab the
collection everything is super
affordable because itself which is
always fantastic and really great but
just nothing calls to me so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over that collection but
I'd love to know your thoughts down
below I'd also love to know your
thoughts on like collabs and what you
think about them I just wanted to I'm
just curious just guys keeping on the
affordable theme let's talk about a new
eyeshadow palette from vies art no I'm
just kidding but advisor art is not
affordable or busy art not the most
affordable brands but they are coming
out with a new eyeshadow palette so this
one is called the Tri State appellate
says it's going to be exclusive to
Beauty lash it's going to be limited
edition and it is going to be $49 I
believe it would have already been for
sale so again fit it's still available
on beauty lush I will have it linked
down below so like I said visor is a
pretty expensive brand I did have my
friend Candace send me the petite pro
eyeshadow palette and then I also got
the theory I shadow palette in
I beauty lish lucky bag which was like
that was the most exciting thing out of
my lucky bag I was pretty excited to see
that in there so I do have two pallets
from a visor and I will also say that it
was around the Sephora VIP sale time I
actually went into my Sephora because I
had placed an order
and one of my pallets came broken so I
went to Sephora and while there I did
watch a visor palette and I was like
completely blown away by the swatches it
was one of their I think it's like a 12
pan palette then like neutral matte
palette or something like that and I was
just like so blown away I was like oh my
gosh I totally get what people are
talking about but I've been trying out
both the petite pro and at the theory
eyeshadow palette and I like them but
I'm not necessarily like super super
blown away but I still kind of want to
try one of those other pals because I
feel like I hear a lot of people say
really good things about that and not
saying I don't like the petite Pro or
the theory pellet and I do definitely
want to be trying them out I think I've
tried each one two times now so I need
to try them out more before I can give
my full review on them but it wasn't
something that I was like absolutely
shook about and I actually pulled those
two out today when I was trying to
decide which I like to do I have those
two pulled out and I was like you know
why and I'm just not really just not
really feeling it I want the do say
palette from or the Duce palette from
Julia's place so I just I was feeling
that one a little bit more so with that
being said I do have two eyeshadow
palettes from the brand that I want to
be trying out a little bit more and I'm
not like 100% sold on them yet so that
makes me to say you know I can go ahead
and pass over this one for the $49 the
shades inside do look really beautiful
they look like my kind of shades but I
know I see a couple that maybe look to
be repeats from the petite Pro I believe
it is I see a couple in there like the
purple and one of the goals I feel like
that would be similar to that palette
and because I want to be trying that one
out to get a review you know I don't
need to like overwhelm myself right now
it does look really pretty and it has a
mirror so that's good but I can go ahead
and save my $49 and just be trying out
the other
- and I want to get a review for but
that is what I think about the busy art
at Rice - palette but have you guys
ordered this one or were you excited to
see it have you tried it the other
advised aren't pellets in the past and
there's something that you really love
or have you tried the petite Pro or the
theory palette and have you had the same
thoughts as me like but maybe you
weren't into it at first but then you
really got into it like I don't I don't
know I'll keep trying them I definitely
do want to get a review out especially
because they are more expensive palettes
you know from a bit of a higher priced
brand but those reviews will be coming
soon but I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over this new on it from Weiser so many
tags on this new highlighter from Becca
cosmetics so Becca is doing the Parisian
a light highlight and it is also in
collaboration with I'm not 100% how
Sarah died mom probably gonna screw this
up aeneas sanaya she's a very beautiful
youtuber she has really fantastic
Instagram photos out and this highlight
looks so so pretty I'll have a photo in
here it has the Eiffel Tower on it which
pulls at me a little bit so it says that
it is inspired by the lights of the
Eiffel Tower at sunset it's a soft
romantic pink press highlighter infused
with golden pearl it says it is
available now in Sephora France and
coming soon it just says in February to
be delish and cold beauty so any links
that I have of course I will have it
down below the swatches look beautiful
the actual highlight looks beautiful I
love Becca highlights this was one that
really really did turn my attention I'm
assuming it's probably gonna be around
$38 I think that's what Becca highlights
typically run for as expensive I know
Becca highlights are more expensive but
they are so freaking pretty and I have
done it I have I have paid full price
for Becca highlights in the past I have
and at first when I saw this one I was
really like completely sold on it and
this is one where at the collaboration
with Becca I guy said I am not familiar
with her there are some collabs where I
feel like I'm gravitating towards it
more because I want to support that
person maybe they're one of my favorite
youtubers are bloggers and I love being
able to support especially you know
entrepreneurs and people who hustle
really hard and get noticed by these
brands I think it's really cool to be
able to
that but there's also sometimes some
products that come out that our
collaboration who I don't know if the
collaborator but I'm just drawn to the
product and that's how I am with this
one you know I'm not familiar with her
but that highlight I was like oh ooh
but I will say that I actually just got
the Oprah pillow-talk highlight to my
friend Ellie sent it to me from over
cosmetics and I am so excited about it
but it kind of reminds me of this one a
little bit I think the Beca one has more
of a gold to it and from when I was
playing with pillow talk just yesterday
is when I got it that one doesn't really
have any golden and it's like pink like
a pink pearl I would say so then I'm
kind of like well I'm really into pink
highlights right now I'm into like pink
everything at this moment lots of pink
makeup happening so like well pink gold
versus the pearly pink like they are
different Vedado dough I think I should
still say no do I think it's beautiful I
love the Eiffel Tower in there the
swatch looks really gorgeous but I know
I know that I have enough highlights and
I know that I'm really excited about
that over pillow talk I mentioned in a
passive Olivia video I was talking about
a collection from Oprah and I was like
if there's one thing I was gonna
purchase it was going to be that pink
highlight because I'm super into it so I
think with that being said I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna pass over this one from Becca
but I know it seems like a lot of people
are really excited for it I I think the
actual highlight just looks so beautiful
the swatches look gorgeous and it's just
my personal style right now I'm gonna go
ahead and be strong I'm gonna say no to
this one but let me know what you think
if you guys are planning on picking this
one up are you familiar with the
collaborator and you are so excited
maybe she's a favorite youtuber of yours
let us know in the comments down below
if you're planning on getting this one
but I'm gonna go ahead and say now well
the final item I'm going to talk about
is an eyeshadow palette and this is a
another collaboration that this is
between a Kat Von D and divine official
who was actor recording star and
international drag icon house rating
from the Instagram page they're a shadow
palette it looks really cool so I'll say
when I saw it I kind of like my eyes
slid over we did a double-take
there's greens in there Blues in there
the packaging is really cool with like
the eyebrows on the mirror I thought
supercool I was interested in it I like
Kat Von D eyeshadow palettes but I took
a moment and I looked at the palette
because I thought why does this like
something just seem just familiar about
this palettes me and I thought that it
reminded me quite a bit of the new Urban
Decay Kristen LeeAnn kaleidoscope
eyeshadow palette that came out which I
really enjoy I reviewed it fairly
recently I really enjoyed that entire
collaboration but especially that
kaleidoscope eyeshadow palette I think
is really nice it has the Blues in there
it has a green in there and then even
some of these kind of shimmery shades
that are somewhat similar to what is in
that palette as well so when I thought
that I was like so would you really need
this eyeshadow palette this one is $38
the Kat Von D and divine is $38 it says
it'll be available on Kat Von D beauty
at February 14th and online Sephora
February 23rd so when I was thinking
about that when I was looking at the
palette and I immediately thought of the
urban decay Kristen LeeAnn my friend
Kelly I've seen her do a few videos
where she's kind of like duping new
makeup releases that are coming out I
think she calls them like dupes for new
releases
/ shot my stash kind of thing - almost
like remind yourself of you probably
have something really similar to that in
your collection I know I think I've seen
some other people do it as well but I
was just watching Kelly's video the
other day and it just kind of inspired
me and especially like where I'm at
right now and like certain things that
I'm going through and like trying not to
buy as much and trying to be reminded of
what's in my collection and doing like
flashback Friday videos throwback
Thursday project pans you know things
like that I kind of wondered if maybe I
should start doing something similar to
that would you guys want to see videos
like that on my channel would you want
to see separate videos would you want me
to be pulling out things that I think
maybe our dupes in the will I buy up
videos I'd love to get some of your
feedback down below because I think it
is a really good idea and it definitely
kind of inspired me maybe watching her
video kind of already had that thought
placed in my mind so then when I was
kind of looking at this palette you know
I thought of what I already have in my
collection so let me know your thoughts
and if you would like something like
that or if you wouldn't you know and any
feedback is always really helpful I
asked for a lot of feedback and I truly
do believe it helps me out so even
though I do like
Wandy again I'm not super familiar with
the collaborator in this instant but the
palette did catch my attention I like
the eyeshadow palettes $38 you know is I
mean it's expensive because it's Kat Von
D but it's not something that's
completely unrealistic to me but I still
like you know what I can I can be happy
with my kaleidoscope palette and even
though I do like that one and you're not
talking about the blues and greens in
here
I don't wear those colors a ton so I
don't need to fill my makeup collection
with shades that I only reach for when
I'm like alright girls do some crazy
today you know I don't need to have a
ton of palettes like that so I know that
I can definitely talk myself out of this
one but I'd love to know what you guys
think were you really excited when you
saw this palette were you really excited
for the collaboration are you definitely
gonna be picking this one up and then
also I would just really love to know
your thoughts on you know some of the
duping for a new makeup releases and
what you think about that idea or do you
think enough people do them you don't
need to see me do them as well I just
would love to know your feedback down
below but because of that because I feel
like I have something so super similar
in my collection as well I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over this one but let us
know your thoughts down below and after
that that's gonna do it for this week's
Villa by a video okay so that is
