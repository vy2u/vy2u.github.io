today's video was going to be a new will
I buy it I post my male bias
every single Wednesday talking about
some new makeup releases and launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then also letting you know if I'm
planning to pick them up or pass over
them as always I have a lot to chat
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started I was seeing some types
come in on a new holiday release from
over cosmetics last week I talked about
everything holiday I think this week is
going to be a mixture I think I have
some holiday and some regular but I just
tried to go off of and so the separating
them like I was doing in the past
regular bullabbai its vs. holiday will I
buy it we're just gonna kind of go with
what I'm being tagged on the most and so
many how their releases are coming out
as we get closer to holiday season but
this one is a holiday release from Oprah
it is their holiday glow palette I'm
looking at it at the Ulta website it
says it is $49 and it says only at Ulta
so I'll have it linked down below and
let's see it has an assortment of glowy
highlighters bright blushes ultra
pigmented shadows the palette was
designed to help you achieve any look of
this season all righty so it does have
the highlighter in blissful which I do
own and I love it the bronzer an
Americano which I actually just got I
haven't tried it yet just got it and
then it does have blushes which I don't
have any Oprah blushes and then the rest
it looks like our eye shadows which they
come with and a range of colors from
like pinks moths there's a black in
there it looks like a gold shimmer maybe
so there's a lot in this palette you're
definitely getting a variety and for $49
I don't think that's a bad price at all
it definitely gave me a double take when
I first saw it I actually tweeted about
it on Twitter whenever I see like new
releases or something that really
catches my eye or something that I think
people might want to know about I
generally will post a tweet about it
because I want to spread the word and
Twitter to me it's just the easiest way
to be able to do that so if you don't
follow me on Twitter yet I'm at by
Samantha March and I tweet a lot about
new makeup if you're interested so got
my attention did the double take I was
interested in it but when I actually
broke it down and looked at what was in
it like I said I have that blissful
highlight and that's like one of the
huge all have the picture in here but
that's you know a really nice sized
highlight I'm not sure if it's full size
but it definitely looks like it could be
and then the bronzer in America
I just got that one so already you know
you're removing two items from the
pallet that I already own so then we're
just looking at blush and eye shadows so
I'm like ooh do I really need that like
if that highlight would have been in
like Rodeo Drive I think I would have
been more drawn to it because I still
want to try that highlight or if I
haven't just gotten the bronzer from
Oprah maybe I'd still be more into it
but when you take away the two largest
pieces of the palette I already have
those doesn't quite make the most sense
for me to get so I am going to pass over
it mostly for the reason being that I
have at two of the larger shades in
there but for me I think this is a
really good deal I was very interested
in it I looked pretty hard at it but it
just doesn't make sense for me to
purchase it but I still think it's a
good deal I'll have it linked down below
of course if anybody's interested in
picking it up do let me know
I've been trying more and more from
Oprah this year and I've been impressed
with basically everything the highlights
the liquid lipsticks are some of my
favorites so I've been very impressed
with them and I do think this one is a
good deal so let us know in the comments
if you were planning to put this one up
so I got another highlight palette here
I was getting a lot of tags on this one
and I was like thank you thank you guys
for tagging me for letting me know that
this beauty has arrived okay so also
looking at the Ulta website and it does
have the little tag that says only at
Ulta so Urban Decay is also sold at
Sephora so this is Tommy it's only going
to hit alt up it is the afterglow
highlighter palette it's $34 and you get
a four highlights in there cuz here it
has four new shades so these are Amish
aids of the Urban Decay's cult favorite
afterglow eight hour powder highlight
that look great on any skin tone so
let's use them individually or cocktail
them to create your custom highlight the
four shades and there are bliss which is
a pill gold of the golden shift peroxide
and iridescent pink NSFW which is peachy
pink and then sidepiece which is a
golden peach yeah
stoked stoked right here this girl is
excited for this palette I saw this one
I saw the tags I saw the photo I saw
what it was I was like yes it is in my
card at Ulta right now I am so excited
for this I recently picked up my first
Urban Decay afterglow highlight shade is
in sin I picked it up for the trying ask
my subscribers favorite makeup video
I'll have that one of the link down
below that highlight was the most
requests
an item that was like the same thing
over and over again because I was asking
everybody what's your favorite you know
why shadow Paula
what's your favorite mascara like at
such from etc and there was all these
different answers coming in the
highlight that was number but just
everybody sin sin sin everybody came
saying I'm like what in the heck okay
fine I'll try whoa
so I tried it and I was like oh my gosh
I need more of these highlighters like
I'm sold and I think for one highlight
it's like $26 24:22 it's like in the 20s
for that one highlighter so to get four
in a palette for $34 I'm like yeah you
got me you got me you don't need to
explain anymore I'm so excited for it
pill gold with a golden shift yep
iridescent pink I have some iridescent
on today I do have to have my ring light
on cuz it's dark so sorry if my lighting
is a little bit crazy but I'm really
into the iridescent right now I have the
chroma key little palette from Sigma on
and they have a lot of iridescent in
there which I didn't think would be my
thing but I'm actually pretty into them
and then a peachy pink I think would be
beautiful the golden peach I think is
the only one that I'm like not for sure
if it'll look great on me but I'm
excited I still want to try it see if I
can pull it off so I am stoked for this
one it is available right now I'm like I
said it's already in my bike at Aalto so
when I check out I'm definitely planning
on getting this one I mean I'm telling
you if you haven't tried the Urban Decay
highlights yet you definitely should if
you're a highlight lover like me I feel
like you have to have tried them and
like I said to get that one individuals
like I'm pretty sure it's $26 so to get
the highlight palette for 34 I think
it's a great deal I'm pretty stoked
about it out planning on picking it up
but about you have you tried any of the
Urban Decay highlights and what are some
of your favorite shades are you
interested in this highlight palette
it's funny because I typically don't go
for highlight palettes I like face
pallets more especially with like
bronzer or blush contour shades things
like that so that's how you know like
this one really got my attention that
this one really got me stoked and that
I'm purchasing another highlight
but yeah urban decay you got me so just
last night I'm following this on Tuesday
and just the last night I started
getting especially a lot of snapchats
about this and I actually was planning
on talking about something else but then
especially with the amount of snaps and
some of the conversations I was having I
was like you know what let's just put it
let's just put it will I buy a video so
on Jaclyn hill so snapchat last night
from the night that I'm filming she
announced that she was doing a
collaboration with the Ulta where Beauty
box so I actually wasn't even aware that
Elora had a beauty box that's pretty
cool to know but they do a beauty box
I think they send it out every month yes
it's a monthly subscription as $15 each
month the first month is $10 and then
you can get a monthly beauty box and
then they collaborated with Jaclyn hill
for their December beauty box so she got
to pick the items that were to go inside
I've seen like Rachel loves has done
this but I can't recall the top of my
head which box it is but I've seen her
do that I want to say like Dani from
coffee back with Dani I think I've seen
her do some sort of collaboration with
subscription boxes that one I'm not
going to present about but I'm pretty
sure rachel loves just did one too so
it's kind of an interesting thing you
know they're not necessarily collabing
with a makeup brand but a subscription
box and they get to put some of their
favorite items in there I think that's a
pretty cool idea so inside the box I'm
Jacqueline did the full full unboxing on
her snapchat and then I'm reading off
the trend mood one Instagram so I will
have her Instagram linked down below but
inside you get a mini Becca cosmetics
and champagne pop highlights Jaclyn hill
collaborate it looks back a couple years
back on champagne pop so it's a little
mini size of that one
you also get an hourglass cosmetics mini
primer a morphe brushes blending brush I
think it was the m4 3 3 if I remember
correctly the philosophy of purity face
wash face cleanser the Oribe matte waves
texture lotion a Dior mascara and then a
$20 gift card to bauble bar
yeah and essence is the monthly a
subscription Jacqueline did say on her
snapchat if you just want to receive the
December box then don't sign up right
now because you would still get the
November box but I think she said as of
like December 1st if you signed up then
you would
get the December box and you can just do
that one time you can sign up for just
that month of the not do any other
months or you can you know do your
monthly subscription but she said that
she would kind of like clarify that in
the future when it was time like when
the signups were ready for her box if
you didn't want both so I would stay
tuned to her social media she would let
you know all that information and that's
pretty interesting for either 10 or 15
dollars I mean you're getting a lot of
different goodies in there which that's
pretty exciting
for me though I'm not gonna get this I I
mean I think it's cool I think it's fun
to see beauty influencers collab and on
these type of subscription boxes I think
that's really neat and like I said I
mean it gave me awareness that allure
has a beauty box because I didn't know
that so I think that's fun I think
there's a lot of items in there that I
don't necessarily need like I have a
champagne pop I have that morphe brush I
probably wouldn't use something like the
or Bay waves texturizing lotion I don't
think I would use that like bauble bar I
don't really wear a lot of jewellery you
can't tell I don't wear a ton of jewelry
so jewelry gift card wouldn't make the
most sense to me wouldn't need a primer
I would like to try that purity the
philosophy purity face wash but that's
really like the only thing in there that
really kind of was like wow that's kind
of cool and so I don't think I would
need to get a beauty box just for that
you know when I can just grab it at Ulta
so just wouldn't make the most a sense
to me to pick up the box but I totally
get it if you're like you know a huge
supporter of Jaclyn hill or you know
maybe you were to get the lower beauty
box I would love to know if anybody does
you know and then you would have this
one coming and that would be pretty
exciting but for me it just I wasn't
really interested in it you know so I'm
I'm not gonna get it but I would love to
know your your thoughts and your
feedback down below do you think it's
cool to see you know an influencer type
of collaboration like this are you not
interested in it are you going to get it
for just the one month
are you interested now I'm viola our
beauty box I would love to know any or
feedback down below but it just didn't
pull me enough to wanted to purchase it
and then like I said just some of the
items inside I either have or I wouldn't
have a lot of uses for so it wouldn't
make the most sense for me to get but as
always I would love to get your thoughts
in the comments down below
already and then the last item gonna
talk about this week is the one that I
was getting the most hang on
for a while even before we saw the
inside I was getting tagged stumped this
one this is the account Von D metal
crush palette the extreme highlight
palette so inside it has three different
highlights which is rose shock a
metallic pink with lavender pink shimmer
he likes not sure I'm saying that right
metallic opal with golden silver shimmer
and a gamma-ray gamma-ray metallic page
in gold shimmer as those can be used
white or dry it is going to be limited
edition I think this is how they
released from Kat Von D it says it will
be available this month at Sephora and
then also in some other countries
December and February you don't see a
price on it yet so I'm not a hundred
percent with the prices I know by the
time this video goes up I'll have it
listed down below where I link
everything and I also put the prices and
what I'm wearing and you know all that
fun stuff so I just kind of know right
away that I am NOT going to be getting
it I mean like I said I am planning to
pick up the Urban Decay highlight
palette I just got the Beca face palette
I mean I just recently bought that Urban
Decay single highlight which was quite
pricey as well I did just receive the
Sigma chroma glow palette I mean I have
a lot of highlights and highlight
palette the face palette is happening in
my life right now so it was kind of easy
for me to talk myself out of the
highlight palette and for some reason I
just I just wasn't really drawn to it I
feel like maybe these aren't quite my
colors which is interesting for me to
say because I didn't think the Sigma
chroma glow would have been my colors
either I wouldn't have purchased that
myself I did get it sent to me in PR and
I actually ended up really enjoying it
so I don't know I guess you never really
know until you try something if it if it
is going to look good on your skin or if
you are going to like the finished
result of it you just never really know
what that being said I still am not
drawn to it enough to purchase it
especially with it being a limited
edition item I'm not draw until the mint
edition like some other people are where
they have to have it because they know
what's gonna go away I don't feel that
way about limited edition and I feel
like with Kat Von D like her limited
edition is fairly like it's a little bit
- edition that's not coming back I know
there's a lot of palettes that a lot of
people would like for her to bring back
and she still won't do it so I have a
pretty good feeling that that one's not
coming back once it's gone and for me I
just I don't get the pull that way for
let me today
I'd rather stay away from it and buy
something that's going to be around for
a long time so I will just keep playing
with my Kat Von D state and Center
eyeshadow pellet still one of my
favorite palettes right now I'm playing
with it so much and I absolutely adore
it I'm gonna pass over the metal crush
highlight palette it doesn't get me
going enough I'm purchasing another
highlight palette and then I just have
enough highlight and face palettes to
get me through the rest of my life plus
another thousand years so so I'm not
going to be getting it but let us know
are you so excited for this one and I
know there are a ton of Kat Von D fans
that you get so excited over every
release so let us know what you think
about it this highlight palette down
below but for me I'm gonna pass over
this one okay so that is everything up
