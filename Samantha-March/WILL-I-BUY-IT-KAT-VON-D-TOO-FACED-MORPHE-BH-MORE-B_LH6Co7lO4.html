today's video is gonna be a new will I
buy it
I've lost my relevant videos every
single Wednesday or I'm talking about
new makeup releases and launches letting
you know a little bit about them and
also talking over if I'm interested in
picking them up or if I'm gonna pass
over them and as always I have a lot to
chat about this week so I'm gonna go
ahead and get started I got a ton of
tags on I knew a sephora favorites
collection one of their lip sets I'm
such a fan of the Sephora especially the
give me some nude lip sets I don't know
how many I have purchased but it's been
a lot of them I think it's such a cool
way to find new lipstick formulas I have
found a bunch of new favorite lipstick
formulas and colors from buying those
sets so I always get a bunch of tags
when new ones come out so let's see it
is available now on the Sephora website
so I'm reading from the trend one one
Instagram so I'll have her patient will
sit down below it's a new give me some
new lip set it's going to be 28 dollars
and includes grand bag cosmetics
plumping a liquid lipstick and smoked
sherry the Urban Decay cosmetics HiFi
shine lip gloss and SPL a Kat Von D
aesthetic kiss lipstick and lovecraft
also the Tarte cosmetics h2o lip gloss
in Bora Bora and anasazi Beverly Hills
lipstick in Ruby which is a full-size
and then the bite Beauty prismatic pearl
multi stick in pink pearl so you have
five deluxe sized lipsticks and then the
Anastacio is a full-size unfortunately
this one is gonna be another miss for me
I feel like the last like to maybe give
me some nude lip sets have been a Miss
for me I'll explain why the grind that
cosmetics I would be interested in
trying out that liquid lipstick but the
Urban Decay lipgloss I actually do have
it I actually have one on today of 1993
on over a Mac lipstick the Kat Von D
Lovecraft I do have that but it is her I
feel well this has studded kiss lipstick
so it might be the exact same thing I
know she recently changed up that that
formula so it could be the new one but I
have that exact same shade and I
actually have a mini of it because I got
it in one of these lip sets sometimes
the bad thing with these lip sets is
that they continually put repeat shades
in there so that one would be a repeat
from the past the terkoz metics lip
gloss I'm not super interested in that
one the Anastasio matte lipstick
Ruby I actually don't like the Anastacio
matte lipstick so for that to be the
full-size product that's a really really
big miss for me because I'm just not a
fan of those lipsticks and then the
white prismatic pearl multi stick that
one I'm just not really interested in
trying it doesn't sound like my sort of
vibes so really the only one in there
that I either don't have or want to try
is only one of the minis liquor on my
cosmetics so it wouldn't be worth it for
me to purchase it so I'm bummed about
that because I've been really wanting to
get another one I've been so excited
every time I see them coming out I'm
like yes please please be the one for me
and it's just it's not yet the one for
me but I do think that these are a good
value if if you are interested in trying
the items that are in there if you don't
have a lot of the repeat shades like I
have but ones in the past where you know
one of the items and there is something
I have because I can just pass it along
but the other items in there and treat
me enough the full-size intrigued me
enough so I think that they're a good
value but unfortunately that one's a
miss for me I did notice one of the
weekly brows to speak on Sephora is one
of these Sephora lip favorites I think
it's on sale for like $19 I'll have that
one listed down below as well but I've
never seen one of their lip sets
included in the weekly wows so that was
pretty interesting I get another one
that wouldn't really work out for me but
I want to chat about excite no I got a
ton of tags guys are have been around my
channel for a while you know I used to
do like dedicated videos on those lips
ads but there just hasn't been one
that's got me really excited lately
which is a bummer but I want to pass
over that one but let us know if you're
interested in it I got a lot of tags to
talk about this new palette from BH
Cosmetics it's the BH of festival and
they're coming out with a whole
collection so they have the weekend
festival eyeshadow palette which is 20
shades for $18 there's also gonna be a
brush set for 10 pieces for $24 I was
mostly just getting asked about the
eyeshadow palette I don't know if my
house is Hana but I swear to you I just
saw someone walk by that door oh I'm
gonna play that back and look at my face
cuz that spooked me I'm also reading and
go story right now so I think it's
messing with my head okay then I'm just
gonna talk about the eyeshadow palette
cuz that is mostly what I was getting
asked on a so of the weekend festival
eyeshadow palette 20 shades for $18 it
is also available at Ulta beauty which i
think is great I totally understand
right a lot of people
are excited about this a festival season
is coming up Coachella all that fun
stuff so we're seeing a lot of these
collections or these pallets or even
like lip colors geared towards these fun
festival makeup looks this one
definitely looks like a lot of fun
I do like BH Cosmetics I do like their
their eyeshadow palettes I wouldn't say
that they're the most high-quality but
they're also really affordable and I
feel like for the price I feel like the
quality does match it it's still not
like an absolutely like crap I shadow
palette but it's just not the most
high-quality if that makes sense I'm
looking at this palette and honestly
like for a second there I was trying to
talk myself into it it does look like it
comes with a mirror too which is great I
feel like I was trying to talk myself
into it like you know you should get
another BH palette in your collection
it's only $18 you can get it at Ulta and
you know all of these fun colorful
shades but there's just something about
it that I was like I just don't feel
like I'm gravitating towards it right
now you know me I mean look at my eye
look today look at my lip color I'm very
much neutral I like to play with color
every once in a while but I don't know
if buying a very colorful I shall I
shadow palette is a good decision for me
if I wanted to I would say to go like a
BH route because you're still getting
good quality but for a better price for
something that I want to reach for on a
really consistent basis but I'm just
kind of thinking about my eyeshadow
palette collection I feel like I have
these shades amongst the the palettes
that I have the pure trolls palette
especially like the Urban Decay Kristin
LeeAnn collection I have a bunch of
single shadows from Kristina and
cosmetics this purple that blue in there
that I mean I just I feel like I have
those so that's why that's why I think I
wasn't gravitating towards it and it's
always interesting so I love watching
videos similar to will I buy it to see
what people you know kind of want to
talk themselves into like I know I don't
need that I know I have it but I'm gonna
be able to justify why I'm gonna pick
that up it's always interesting for
mates is to see what everyone else
thinks but for me this is one where I
can easily say like know if I don't need
it
it's similar enough to other items in my
collection I could do it more easily but
I don't think this palette would be a
bad addition to your eyeshadow palette
to collection but for me I'm just gonna
stay strong I'm gonna say no to it but
it's pretty darn cool
so morphe brushes I feel like they're
coming out with a lot lately I feel like
I'm getting tagged on them a lot I kind
of try to space out my releases when I'm
talking about them in here and try to
space out my brands for the releases in
my will i buy up videos but they sure
are coming out with quite a bit so they
have new blush trios and also blush
palettes that they're coming out with
and I think maybe a lot of people know
but I really I gravitate towards
palettes like this so I was getting
quite a few tanks I thought I would chat
about it so they have several new blush
trios so three shades for $12 they also
have blush palette and those are going
to be $20 each and they have eight
shades in them it says they'll be
available on April 12th on their website
and in stores morphe I don't know if she
means the morphe stores because morphe
does have standalone stores but they are
also sold at Ulta so not a hundred
percent sure about that but April 12th
is when they'll be available and the
palettes do look really pretty for me I
personally would gravitate towards the
trio versus the eight because I just
feel like it's like too much for me I
feel like for a blush palette I think
three is pretty darn good so I would be
more interested in the trios it also
does look like they have a mirror on it
which is good but I will say with morphe
face palettes
they don't get me as excited at areas of
snoring so loud can you hear her do you
not care you know you don't care she
don't care about blush trios I will say
that for the morphe a face palette I've
tried out some of their other ones and
they just don't really do much for me I
think I've maybe declared all of them
out of my collection and my niece just
had a birthday and I sent her another
like I think I had one more morphe face
palette in my collection and I was like
girlfriend I think you're gonna get more
use out of this than I am so I shipped
it off to her as well they just threw
the quality just isn't there for me and
I just don't reach for them as much so
that is why when I see this and I'm
thinking about do I want that do I need
that I have a feeling able to end up
like my other morphe face palettes for I
just don't get a lot of use out of them
I shall the palates I really do enjoy
but for some reason their face palettes
I just never really got on with so for
me these morphe blush trios and also the
blush palettes I don't think I'm gonna
enough use out of them I don't think I'm
gonna reach for them at on it so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass over them but
I'd love to know do these catch your
attention do you have to have some bet a
lot of questions on this set from Too
Faced this is called the sex on the
peach complexion set like I understand
where sex on the peach is coming from
right sex on the beach haha that's funny
but sex on the peach sounds dirty it
sounds weird it sounds like you have a
problem with fruit it makes me look at
peaches in a different way I'm not sold
on this name and it kind of creeps me
out what is that but if we move past the
name little if you try to move past the
name it says it's a $45 set it's a set
of peaches and cream complexion
essentials in both mini and full sizes
plus a full size better than sex mascara
as you're also getting the peach setting
powder the primed and peachy primer and
then the peach mist so when I first saw
this photo and looked at it I thought
the primer was going to be the
foundation like a mini foundation and
that actually got me excited and I truly
thought about just just forget about the
name and just try it out because
foundation has got a lot of good reviews
and you'd like to try out new
foundations and then when I found out it
was just the primer I was like boo that
kind of takes it back for me and it kind
of just a little bit kind of lost its
value for me for a mascara that I mean
you you always get the Too Faced better
than sex mascara in collections from Too
Faced from Sephora Ulta I mean it seems
like you're always getting somehow even
just a mini size if not a full size of
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
and it's not my favorite so immediately
that gets knocked down I don't use
setting powders a ton they're not my
favorite at the moment so I'm kind of
like her about the powder the setting
spray I didn't like maybe interested in
trying and then the primer I'm just I'm
not super hyped about so this set once I
saw what was inside I just wasn't
getting hyped for it and the name is
just so freaking weird
what is that so I'm gonna pass over this
complexion that said I don't think
would get enough use out of it to
justify the $45 for it even though I'm
someone who is attracted to these
collections I'm attracted to minis
because it's really hard for me to go
through full-sized products at the same
time I really have to stop and think
about what do I actually use what would
I actually be able to like test out what
would I actually be able to get my
money's worth out of this set and
sometimes you just have to you just have
to say no so I'm saying no to sex on the
peach I hope I say no so next up there
is a new foundation being released from
Beauty bakery this is called their cake
mix foundation it's a demi matte
foundation it's available in 30 shades
it says it's a long wear foundation
going to be available April 19th
it'll be 28 dollars each Beauty bakery
can be found on their websites on this
one I'm interested in because I'm like a
foundation junkie I don't know when my
love of like trying new foundations is
going to cease but it's not it's not
happening any time soon
so whenever I see a new foundation come
out I'm instantly kind of like giving it
the side-eye I have never tried anything
from Beauty bakery so I think for that
reason I'm gonna wait to see some
reviews come out and see what people
think about it I feel like a demi matte
foundation it sounds like something that
I would like I'm not someone who's super
interested in like the full coverage
super mattifying of foundations I tend
to prefer medium coverage and more of a
dewy finish so I'm not a hundred percent
especially because it says long wear
that usually means more full coverage
but Demi matte I don't know I think I'm
gonna wait and see what some of the
reviews say and just see what people are
saying about the foundation and see if
it would be a good fit for me before I
run out and buy it there's also I talked
about a Sunday Bryleigh foundation and
the cover FX foundation
fairly recently and I will it by a video
and I'm still eyeing both of those I'm
waiting for the VIP sale to come up but
I know I'm gonna at least purchase one
foundation in the vib sale I think
probably the cover FX cuz I'm not sure
if the sunday rally will be available by
then but like I'm just like itching to
try a new foundation so I kinda am
leaning more on that side right now
especially because I'd be able to get a
discount but $28 I don't feel like
that's a bad price I don't see on here
how much you get with the foundation but
I mean I can definitely appreciate it
looks like there
really good shade range with the 30
different shades but it looks like it
covers a pretty wide spectrum which is
great like I said I haven't tried a ton
from Beauty bakery I don't know if I've
tried anything from Beauty bakery I
think I've just got a few lip products
in when Babs Beauty sent me a really
sweet package she included a couple
Beauty bakery lipsticks but I don't
think I've tested them out yet so I
really don't have much to go on with the
brand so this is where I like you guys
to chime in
have you guys purchased from Beauty
bakery you know what do you think of our
website and the shipping and all of that
let me know I would also love to know if
you guys are interested in this
foundation if you're leaning towards it
or are you like being like maybe there's
another foundation out there that has
your attention a little bit more that's
kind of where I'm at with this
foundation but if there are a lot of
good reviews out there and it sounds
like a foundation that would work well
for me
I'm not against a trying it out because
that's just that's just my life right
now
that's just my makeup vibes right now
but I'd love to know you guys think
about the sign up from Beauty bakery
already we got one more to talk about
today
usually I'm I don't know if anyone's
noticed I did this last week to I'm
trying to expand on more than just I
typically would talk about four items or
you know collections or things like that
I know that a very long-winded when I
talk and I like to get super chatty if
you guys don't know I'm a published
author
I love storytelling so you get that in a
lot of my videos I'm the same way yeah
meet me in real life ask Georgia Harris
I told are all kinds of stories when she
was visiting me so sometimes it's hard
for me to like limit myself so much but
I know super long videos aren't always
appreciated either so but I'm trying cuz
I'm I'm trying to chat about more in
these videos even though I do them every
week there's always so much makeup
coming out it's crazy but I know that I
got so many tags on this one it's a
little bit hard to chat about so far
because there's not a ton I don't
believe of information that we have yet
but Kat Von D is releasing a new
eyeshadow palette this is the 10-year
anniversary I shadow palette says it
includes all new shades each named after
the 10 muses Kat Von D selected for
their upcoming anniversary campaign
there is going to be an entire
collection with the liquid lipsticks a
studded kiss lipsticks tattoo liners a
brush collection of the metal crush
extreme highlighter and then of course
this eyeshadow palette says it will be
available on May 5th and I say it's kind
of hard to talk about because there
isn't a
on it yet so I'm not a hundred percent
what she's gonna be pricing this at but
at the time that I'm filming there is
not a price listed for the eyeshadow
palette but I will say when I saw the
first photo my mind kind of immediately
went to the movie to loca palette when
Georgia was here and we did film
together she actually brought that
palette down and I actually used it in
our get ready with me I really enjoyed
that I shadow palette so this one is is
speaking to me right now I will also say
that the photos don't like we don't have
the best photos yet at least the ones
that I have been able to find but the
colors in there look pretty darn cool of
course there's a blue but there's a
green and purple it looks like a red and
an orange and a yellow like it just
looks like a cool palette and I have a
feeling that this will be a limited
edition does it say it doesn't say for
sure in this post but my guess is gonna
be that it's limited edition and when
Kat Von D does limited edition it's
typically limited edition so for me it's
probably gonna depend on the price and
then I would like to see like the full
palette instead of kind of these more
like blurry photos that we have so far
but I can chat about it again in an
upcoming video if you'd want to see it
but as of right now I'm interested in it
I'm gonna be eyeing it we have a little
bit till it's gonna come out and I would
like to see the price and the complete
palette you know kind of like as a whole
good photos of it but I'm pretty
interested in this one especially I did
not get the movie to loca palette I know
a lot of people are bummed that it was
limited edition and it didn't come back
so I'm curious about this one I like Kat
Von D's eyeshadows so I'm definitely
leaning towards this one I'll be
watching for it but you'll have to let
me know what you think about that
palette were you super excited when you
saw the photos do you do you not even
care that there's no price yet or like
the really pretty release photos and you
just know that you're gonna get it I
would love to know but after that that's
gonna do it for this week's will I buy a
video okay so that is everything for
this week's of Willey my video I hope
that you enjoyed this video are you
found it helpful or entertaining in some
way as always let me know what you
thought about all of the new releases
that I talked about what are you so
excited for and what it what see we have
no interest in I always like to know and
