today's video is going to be a new will
i buy it video I suppose my villa by
videos every single Wednesday when I'm
talking about new makeup a launches and
letting you guys in a little bit about
them and discussing why are why not i
will be purchasing from them like i said
i do post these every single Wednesday I
also post on thursday sundays and
mondays so you get four videos from me
each week if I hope that you will hit
the subscribe button and become a part
of the fam but I always have lots of
talks bug I really by videos so why
don't we go ahead and get started so I
always love hearing what you guys want
me to talk about in these videos so you
can always send them to me here you can
make a comment on any of my videos you
can send me on snapchat estimated out
march twitter app by samantha march or
just tag me on instagram which is
probably the way I get most of the
requests in and I have marched beauty
worried over there so just arguing a
couple pegs on Instagram about the melt
cosmetics digital dust highlighters so
it looks like there are three different
shades i believe stargazer gold or and
nova they're supposed to last up for 12
hours and give a dewy and healthy finish
not to be glittery their cruelty free
and vegan there thirty nine dollars each
they were going on sale i believe on
april twenty fourth so as always
everything that i can find i will leave
a link down below so i actually do not
have a lot from melt cosmetics I keep
wanting to purchase from them I hear
their eye shadow stocks are really good
i see a lot of people using them and
super interested in the brand i just
have not purchased from them yet I feel
like you guys might know what I'm going
to say any are not new to my channel but
I do not need to purchase any more
highlighters right now I have a lot of
highlighters and I just don't need them
right now so I'm definitely going to be
passing over these highlighters from
melt cosmetics they do look really cool
the packaging looks like a lot of fun
they look like gorgeous highlighters I
like that there's the different shades
for the different skin tones that's
awesome thirty-nine dollars for one
highlighter though is like the success
of what did I pay for the Smashbox and
Casey homes like thirty dollars $35 I
think and that was for three highlights
and then even for the massage and Nicole
glow kit that I just thought that was 64
highlights for forty dollars so to spend
thirty nine dollars on one highlight
like that's just too pricey for me I
think even if I wasn't on my highlighter
no buy at this moment I wouldn't be
purchasing from them anyways so that's
just me that's just a lot of money for a
highlighter I do enjoy highlights and
back on the highlighter and of course
I've bought a ton of new highlighters so
even while I think that they look cool i
just i don't think that they would be a
smart purchase for me so i'm going to
skip over the amount cosmetics
highlighters that are coming out but i
would love to know are you planning on
purchasing these are you super loyal to
me melt cosmetics Brean what do i need
to try some them let us know in the
comments down below I an elastic on this
on Instagram it is a for the KL polish
or kathleenlights she started her on
nail polish brand which is super cool
she's coming out with some spring shades
she's coming out to spring collection it
has six of fun colors is that's what she
said st. Clare coconut milk hug and roll
special ice cream and then also miss
honey and they are going to be 8 50 each
or you can buy them in the bundle which
is a $45 so that's awesome I'm out and
took pictures on here so you can see
what the difference polishes will look
like so I do have one polish from KL
fellowships actually sent to me from a
friend a social media family member
Danielle sent me a snickerdoodle from
the line and I love it with a gorgeous
nude I tend to mostly we're like news
and light paints on my nails I've had
this purple on for a while because i
keep getting so many compliments on it
but it's very really were like lots of
color on my nails so this has been a fun
change but i was very impressed with
that formula and nail polishes are that
thing where if you read a bad nail
polish like it's a bad nail polish and
it sucks like i've had that time where I
started painting my nails and been like
nope this is not going well and I'll
take it right off and go to a tried and
true nail polish and KL polish
definitely made it into like my
tried-and-true polishes so i would
definitely repurchase one from
kathleenlights i think looking at the
shades see they're all kind of like
bright and poppy which isn't quite
totally me maybe hug and roll which
looks like a light lavender even though
I know it have a lot of ice I always buy
the same shades of nail polish too but
I'm like no they're different sometimes
I'll ask on my snapchat like what color
should i paint my nails and i'll have
like two or three different options and
i was like those are all the same right
now they're different smell very
different so hug and roll looks really
interesting or Miss Honey little cool
color to enroll in the honey or be the
ones that I'd go back and forth on maybe
in this honey because i know i have a
light purple as well so maybe i would do
like Miss Honey but 850 I don't think
it's bad for a nail polish at all and
like I said I think they're really
really good nail polishes so I would
definitely be buying one from the spring
collection nail polishes are already on
sale falling secale tallish website down
below I know what the first launch they
did sell out so I don't know what all is
unstuck at the moment but i'll leave the
website a link down below so you can
check it out but yes i would definitely
recommend these and i would definitely
like to purchase one from the new set
i'm kind of like a nail polish junkie i
love nail polishes I love to paint my
nails I paint all my own nails I get my
acrylic still at the salon and then I
come home and paint my nails because I
love nail polish and I have a lot of
nail polishes so yeah I'll definitely
beginning one from the new
kathleenlights line okay i just had to
pop off for a second because something
very cool actually just happened
allure.com featured myself and also
kimberly-clark choose the creator of the
anti haul videos which inspired the
spin-off series for the will I bias they
just featured us in an article that they
did for their online magazine i'll have
it went down below about the growing
popularity of the anti haul videos and
why more and more people are being drawn
to watching anti hell videos and then
subsequently the will i buy eight videos
as well so that was very fun in the
middle of filming i cut the email that's
article with live psycho check it out
and i was so excited about it that was
really cool to be interviewed and
featured especially along with kimberly
clark that was really like that was
super cool so I'll have the article to a
lure linked down below but it's so funny
that it came in the middle of filling a
lullaby video like I just felt like that
timing worked out very well
but moving on I wanted to talk about it
cosmetics I got a couple pegs on
Instagram about this and I remember the
first time hearing about it someone
actually sent it to my snapchat I was
like what are they sharing so it
cosmetics is coming out with confidence
in your glow palace there's an instant
noodle oh and instant natural glow in an
instant warm globe so they'll be
available the second week of May at Ulta
what it is is a bronzer a blush and
highlight and the 32 dollars each they
remind me of the Kevin daquan like the
new highlighters that he released I'll
have its Jason 30 down here but it
definitely gave me those Kevin tequan
type of vibes but then also along with
those they also released a brush and the
brush kind of like goes with it you buy
it separately but I think the idea is
that you're buying this brush for the
confidence interval of pellets so the
brush looks really cool it says it's
infused with skincare it includes silk
niacin antioxidants and peptides and
it's forty eight dollars and again will
be available second week of madness
exclusive to ulta beauty so I did talk
about the Kevin of Quan in a pasture lay
by eight video I decided to skip over
that mostly because they were pretty
pricey so to touch on the brush the
brush is 40 a dollar so just expensive
for a brush what it looks really cool
and it apparently has skincare infused
in it which blowing my mind forty-eight
dollars like look at could I do it and
then when I look at the different
palettes I feel very angry that I feel
very drawn to these so I've been saying
a lot of my videos like I don't need
blush bronzer highlights because I've
been fine so many of them I don't need
them i'm going to pass over them because
i have too many of them and then it
cosmetics comes out with this and I'm
like do I need that I'm very angry at
myself but I surely think that I want it
but good news and lastly will i buy the
i think was last week I talked about the
lorac types of the
caribbean collection and that i was
thinking of caching and my also points
to buy the eyeshadow palette if you
haven't seen the video yet i think it
was posted just last video larocca
actually set me as a pirates of the
caribbean collection which was like the
most mind-blowing thing ever so i didn't
have to use my otha beauty points so
should i use my ulta beauty points on
this because i think i really want to do
it and i feel like if i were to use my
point I wouldn't feel have that like I
wouldn't feel as guilty about it it's
kind of like you know some people treat
their alta points like treats you know
like like an extra little boost a little
bonus yeah these maybe do a double take
and i say in a lot of my will advise
videos this products make me do double
takes I will seriously consider them and
think on them sometimes I still end up
passing over them but if a product
doesn't make me do a double take I don't
even need to consider it talked myself
into it I just move on to the next one
and this one definitely caused me to do
a double take I think the brush some
super interesting i would love to see
how it works and these look really
pretty the chemin de cuantas thought
were beautiful as well they were like
fifty eight dollars apiece so so that
was too expensive for me but at $32 i
think i want it i think for sure i'm
going to get one of the pallets the
brush i might try to put a little bit
more consideration into but something is
telling me that I'm probably just come
on i'll probably just going to go ahead
and get the brush too I hear amazing
things about it cosmetics precious and I
don't have any of their brushes so again
with mile two points if you won't feel
as bad but i think i'm going to go ahead
and get these let me know your thoughts
let me know what you think let me don't
really go crazy i always enjoy hearing
your opinions but if anybody else going
to pick one of these up does a skincare
brush have you very intrigued as well as
do you like these pallets i would love
to know let me know the con all right
good down to the last product that we're
talking about in this week's will i buy
a video just anybody have any idea what
I could be talking about last and this
week's will i buy it video it is once
again item that i got i started i feel
like i know something big is happening
when I start getting a lot of snapshots
I get a lot of tag
instagram but when the snapchats start
coming in I'm like people are really
excited about this and you know you know
that Kim kardashian-west assuming of
wood her sister Kylie cosmetics and
coming out with for Allah peas oh yes
everybody's freaking out so Kim
Kardashian west it's coming out with a
new formula from Kylie cosmetics it's
the crim a liquid lipstick so it's 45
dollars each and it includes four
different shades we have Kiki which is a
pinky nude Kim a peachy nude Kimmy a
deep nude and Kimberly a true nude okay
they will be available april twenty
fists so it would be the day before this
video goes live it will be available at
3pm PSP you can only get Kelly cosmetics
on Kelly cosmetics calm so I have to
tell you once again I am very very very
upset about this release because I
talked about Kylie cosmetics a lot she's
definitely been releasing more from her
cosmetics line so i feel like i've
mentioned turn a lot of Livia videos and
I've said like nothing's really catching
my eye nothing is making me do that
double take nothing is just calling to
me and because her products are more
expensive you can only order from the
website sometimes the shipping can take
a while I know there's been issues there
there's the product issues in the past
like Kylie cosmetics is a new company so
there's going to be Kings to figure out
along the way I've also talked about how
I've been frustrated with the matte
lipstick formula about how they're so
inconsistent for one liquid lipstick to
the next report lipstick you don't
really know what you're getting so all
of that said when our sergeant Kylie
snapchats and when the little video came
out of Kim Kardashian west by Kylie I
went and I thought no no I did it I did
the double take I did a double take and
then I was watching Kim Kardashian
snapchat and she had a photo of the
different lipsticks and then what like
color shade each of them are going to be
and before I even knew it before it was
like a conscious thought in my brain I
had already screened
at it because I wanted to know what the
different shades were and that happened
and I was like well I Samantha why so I
think what's getting me the packaging is
very pretty I like the packaging on the
liquid lipsticks nudes and pink news
they're my jam they're my jam they are
what i have so much of their what I love
to buy their what I love to wear one
thing that I'll say it's $45 I don't
know if I misspoke earlier it's $45 for
the set it was kind of the same when
Khloe Kardashian came out with her set
of lipsticks from Kylie cosmetics you
bought them as a set so you're getting
four of the creme lipstick for $45
honestly I don't think that's a bad
price because I'm used to paying like I
just bought a new kapadia liquid
lipstick and these are twenty dollars
apiece so if I were to buy for them
that's eighty dollars so $45 I don't
think it's a bad price and honestly when
I was looking at them I was looking up a
different swatches and you know we have
to pinky new with peach nude deep new
true nude I was like oh look which one
what I get like you know I was like one
of those like super stressful first
world problems like what oh what do I do
and then when I saw that you bought it
as i said i was like wow well that took
care of that for me so i'm gonna i'm
going to say you guys i'm going to try
to get a set yes i am now i probably
will not get it and i know that but I'm
at least going to give it a whirl the
cali cosmetics launches are crazy and
they are not easy to do it's i'm not
going to do the thing where I like set
an alarm like I'm not by my computer
when it launches then it wasn't meant to
be that's kind of how I think of it so
if i happen to be home and I haven't
moved on the computer at the time that
it launches then i'll go ahead and get
on it and see if i can get it but even
still if i am there right at the actual
second that it goes on sales are still
really good chance i'm not going to get
them if i don't get up and i'll just
know it wasn't meant to be and that's
okay and then i will move on but i'm
going to try i haven't tried to get
anything from crowley cosmetics and a
very long time like her holiday
collection of her valentine's day
collection i have passed over
this truly does interest me I can't say
I'm a huge fan of Kim Kardashian like
Khloe was definitely my favorite sister
but Chloe's set even though I was like
yeah Khloe love Khloe none of those
shades really interested me so I was
like I'm gonna pass over it but I just
really like the shade the shade speak to
me I'm curious about this creme creme
liquid formula I'm very serious to see
how that would wear so I'm just I think
yeah I think I'm going to do it I did
the double take I was looking at the
swatches I've been paying attention to
what they look like the photos I've been
looking up the kindly cosmetics
Instagram to look at the photos I saw
the price and it made me even more
excited so I'm going to go for it i'm
gonna give it a try I can make no
promises but I'm not least gonna going
to try and see if I can get the Kim
Kardashian west by Kylie cosmetics
lipsticks let me know just get a sink do
you think I'm crazy did you guys get
excited for did you do the double take
and you've been looking at the swatches
or am I the only one that's like super
excited about this but I'd love to know
