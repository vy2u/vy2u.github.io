today's video is going to be a new will
I buy up video I post my will I buy
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about
new makeup a launches and letting you
guys know a little bit about them and
discussing why or why not I will be
purchasing from them like I said I do
post these every single Wednesday I also
post on Thursdays and Sundays and
Mondays so you get four videos from me
each week so I hope that you will hit
the subscribe button and become a part
of the fam but I always have lots of
talk bub how will i buy videos so why
don't we go ahead and get started so I
always love hearing what you guys want
me to talk about in these videos so you
can always send them to me here you can
leave comments on any of my videos you
can send her to me on snapchat and
smooth adapt March Twitter app by
Samantha March or just tag me on
Instagram which is probably the way I
get most of the requests in and I have
much of you to worry over there so I
just started getting a couple tags on
Instagram about the melt cosmetics
digital dust highlighters so it looks
like there are three different shades I
believe stargazer gold or and Nova
they're supposed to last up for 12 hours
and give a dewy and healthy finish not
to be glittery they're cruelty free and
vegan at their $39 each and they were
going on sale I believe on April 24th so
as always everything that I can find I
will leave it linked down below so I
actually do not have a lot from melt
cosmetics I keep a wanting to purchase
from them I hear their eyeshadow stocks
are really good I see a lot of people
using them and I'm super interested in
the brand I just have not purchased from
them yet I feel like you guys might know
what I'm gonna say if you're not new to
my channel but I do not need to purchase
any more highlighters right now I have a
lot of highlighters and I just don't
need them right now so I'm definitely
going to be passing over these
highlighters from melt cosmetics they do
look really cool the packaging looks
like a lot of fun they look like
gorgeous highlighters I like that
there's the different shades for the
different skin tones that's awesome $39
for one highlighter though is like
that's expensive what did I pay for the
Smashbox and Casey Holmes like $30 $35 I
think and that was for three highlights
and then even for the Nastasia and
Nicole glow kit that I just bought that
was sick
different highlights for $40 so to spend
$39 on one highlight like that's just
too pricey for me I think even if I
wasn't on my highlighter no buy at this
moment I wouldn't be purchasing from
them anyways so that's just me that's
just a lot of money for a highlighter
I do enjoy highlights and back on the
highlight ring and of course I bought a
ton of new highlighters so even while I
think that they look cool I just I don't
think that they would be a smart to
purchase for me so I'm gonna skip over
the melt cosmetics highlighters that are
coming out but I would love to know are
you planning on purchasing these are you
super loyal to the melt cosmetics brand
what do I need to try from them let us
know the comments down below
I got a laugh tags on this on Instagram
it is for the KL polish or
kathleenlights she started her own nail
polish brand which is super cool and
she's coming out with some spring shades
she's coming out the spring collection
it has six of fun colors is that's what
she said st. Clare coconut milk hug and
roll pistachio ice cream and then also
Miss Honey and they're going to be 850
each or you can buy them in the bundle
which is a $45 so that's awesome I'm out
insert the pictures down here so you can
see what the different polishes look
like so I do have one polish from KL
polish I was actually sent to me from a
friend a social media family member
Danielle sent me a snickerdoodle from
the line and I loved it it was a
gorgeous nude I tend to mostly wear like
news and like Pink's on my nails I've
had this purple on for a while because I
keep getting so many compliments on it
but I very rarely wear like lots of
color on my nails so this has been a fun
change but I was very impressed with
that formula and nail polishes are that
thing where if you beat a bad nail
polish like it's a bad nail polish and
it sucks like I've had that time where
I've started painting my nails and been
like nope this is not going well and
I'll take it right off and go to a tried
and true nail polish and Kaila polish
definitely made it into like my
tried-and-true polishes so I would
definitely repurchase one from
kathleenlights I think looking at the
shades see they're all kind of like
bright and poppy which isn't
totally me baby hug and roll which looks
like a light lavender even though I know
and have a lot of eye I always buy the
same shades of nail polish too but I'm
like no they're different sometimes I'll
ask him right snapchat like what color
should I paint my nails and I'll have
like two or three different options and
I'm like those are all the same right no
they're different no they're different
so hug and roll looks really interesting
or Miss Honey look like a cool color to
enroll in Miss Honey would be the ones
that I'd go back and forth on maybe I
miss honey because I know I have a light
purple as well so maybe I would do like
Miss Honey but 8:50 I don't think is bad
for a nail polish at all and like I said
I think they're really really good nail
polishes so I would definitely be buying
one from the spring collection nail
polishes are already on sale so I'll
link the KL polish website down below I
know the first launch they did sell out
so I don't know what all is unstuck at
this moment but I'll leave the website a
link down below so you can check it out
but yes I would definitely recommend
these and I would definitely like to
purchase one from the new set I'm kind
of like a nail polish junkie
I love nail polishes I love to paint my
nails I paint all my own nails I get my
acrylics filled at the salon and then I
come home and paint my nails because I
love nail polish and I have a lot of
nail polishes so yeah I'll definitely
beginning one from the new
kathleenlights line okay I just had to
pop off for a second because the thing
very cool actually just happened a lure
com featured myself and also Kimberly
Clark she was the creator of the anti
haul videos which inspired the spin-off
series for the will I buy yet they just
featured us in an article that they did
for their online magazine I'll have that
link down below about the growing
popularity of the anti haul videos and
why more and more people are being drawn
to watching anti hell videos and then
subsequently the will I buy up videos as
well so that was very fun in the middle
of filming I got the emo that article
went lives I had to go check it out and
I was so excited about it that was
really cool to be interviewed and
featured especially along with Kimberly
Clark that was really like that was
super cool so I'll have the the article
to a lure linked down below but it's so
funny that it came in the middle of
filming a will I buy a video like I just
felt like that time I worked out very
well
but moving on I wanted to talk about a
cosmetics I got a couple tags on
Instagram about this and I remember the
first time hearing about it someone
actually sent it to my snapchat and I
was like why are they sharing so it
cosmetics is coming out with confidence
in your glow palettes there's an instant
noodle and instant natural glow and an
instant warm globe says they'll be
available the second week of May at Ulta
what it is is a bronzer a blush and
highlight and they're $32 each they
remind me of the Kevin Kwan like the new
highlighters that he released
I'll have the pictures inserted down
here but it definitely gave me those
Kevin Daquan type of vibes but then also
along with those they also released a
brush and the brush kind of like goes
with it you buy it separately but I
think the idea is that you're buying
this brush for the confidence in Arcola
pellets so the brush looks really cool
it says it's infused with skincare it
includes silk
niacin antioxidants and peptides and
it's of $48 and again will be available
at the second week of night and it's
exclusive to Alta Beauty so I did talk
about the Kevin of Kwan's in a past
related video I decided to skip over
them mostly because they were pretty
pricey so to touch on the brush the
brush is $48 so just expensive for a
brush but it looks really cool and it
apparently has skincare infused in it
which is blowing my mind
$48 like look could could I do it and
then when I look at the different
palettes I feel very angry that I feel
very drawn to these so I've been saying
a lot of my videos like I don't need
blush bronzer highlights because I've
been buying so many of them I don't need
them I'm going to pass over them because
I have too many of them and then it
cosmetics comes out with this and I'm
like do I need that I'm very angry at
myself but I surely think that I want it
but good news and last books will I buy
a video I think was last week's I talked
about the lorac Pirates of the Caribbean
selection and that I was thinking of
cashing in my altar points to buy the
eyeshadow palette if you haven't seen
the video yet I think it was posted just
last video lorac actually sent me the
Pirates of the Caribbean collection
which was like the most mind-blowing
thing ever so I didn't have to use my
ulti beauty points so should I use my
ulti beauty points on this because I
think I really want to do it and I feel
like if I were to use my point
I wouldn't feel as bad like I wouldn't
feel as guilty about it it's kind of
like you know some people treat their
Ulta points like treats you know like
like an extra little boots a little
bonus yeah these made me do a
double-take and I say in a lot of my
will I buy at videos of products make me
do double takes I will seriously
consider them and think on them
sometimes I still end up passing over
them but if a product doesn't make me do
a double-take I don't even need to
consider it talked myself into it I just
move on to the next one and this one
definitely caused me to do a double-take
I think the brush so I'm super
interesting I would love to see how it
works and these look really pretty the
camera no qualms I thought were
beautiful as well they were like fifty
eight dollars apiece though so that was
too expensive for me but had thirty two
dollars I think I want it I think for
sure I'm going to get one of the
palettes the brush I might try to put a
little bit more consideration into but
something is telling me that I'm
probably just gonna I'm probably just
gonna go ahead and get the brush too I
hear amazing things about it Cosmetics
precious and I don't have any of their
brushes so again with my Ulta points
maybe it won't feel as bad but I think
I'm gonna go ahead and get these let me
know your thoughts let me know what you
think let me know if you think I'm crazy
I always enjoy hearing your opinions but
if anybody else going to pick one of
these up then the skin care brush have
you very intrigued as well do you like
these palettes I would love to know let
me know in the comments all right guys
down to the last product that we're
talking about in this week's will I buy
a video just anybody have any idea what
I could be talking about last and this
week's lil I buy a video it is once
again the item that I got I started I
feel like I know something big is
happening when I start getting a lot of
snapshots I get a lot of tags
Instagram but when the snapchats start
coming in I'm like people are really
excited about this and you know you know
that Kim kardashian-west is teaming up
with her sister Kylie cosmetics and
coming out with for Allah B's oh yes
her butt is freaking out so Kim
kardashian-west is coming out with a new
formula from Kylie cosmetics it's the
creme a liquid lipstick so it's $45 each
and it includes four different shades we
have Kiki which is a pinky nude Kim a
peachy nude Kimmy a deep nude and
Kimberly a true nude okay they will be
available April 25th
so it would be the day before this video
goes live it will be available at 3 p.m.
PST you can only get Kylie cosmetics on
Kylie cosmetics comm so I have to tell
you once again I am very very very upset
about this release because I talked
about Kylie cosmetics a lot she's
definitely been releasing more from her
cosmetics line so I feel like I've
mentioned turned a lot of will I buy
eight videos and I've said like
nothing's really catching my eye nothing
is making me do that double take nothing
is just calling to me
and because her products are more
expensive you can only order from the
website sometimes the shipping can take
a while I know there's been issues there
there's been product issues in the past
like Kylie cosmetics is a new company so
there's gonna be King stuff figure out
along the way
I've also talked about how I've been
frustrated with the matte lipstick
formula about how they're so
inconsistent from one liquid lipstick to
the next liquid lipstick you don't
really know what you're getting so all
of that said when I was watching Kylie
snapchats and when the little video came
of Kim kardashian-west by Kylie I went
and I thought no no I did it I did the
double take I did the double take and
then I was watching Kim Kardashian's
snapchats and she had a photo of the
different lipsticks and then what like
color shade each of them were gonna be
and before I even knew it before it was
like a conscious thought in my brain
I'd already screenshotted it because I
wanted to know what the different shades
were and that happened at I was like hi
Samantha
why so I think what's getting me the
packaging is very pretty I like the
packaging on the liquid lipsticks nudes
and pink nudes they're my jam
they're my jam they are what I have so
much of their what I love to buy they're
what I love to wear one thing that I'll
say it's $45 I don't know if I'm I spoke
earlier it's $45 for the set it was kind
of the same when Khloe Kardashian came
out with her set of lipsticks from Kylie
cosmetics you bought them as a set so
you're getting four of the cream
lipsticks for $45 honestly I don't think
that's a bad price because I'm used to
paying like I just bought a new Kat Von
D liquid lipstick and these are $20
apiece so if I were to buy four of them
that's $80 so $45 I don't think is a bad
price and honestly when I was looking at
them I was looking at the different
swatches and you know we have the pinky
nude with peach nude deep new true nude
I was like I don't know look which one
would I get like you know I was like one
of those like super stressful first of
all problems like what oh what do I do
and then when I saw that you bought it
as I said I was like well well that took
care of that for me so I'm gonna I'm I'm
gonna say it you guys I'm going to try
to get the set yeah I am now I probably
will not get it and I know that but I'm
at least gonna give it a whirl the Kylie
cosmetics launches are crazy and they
are not easy to do it's I'm not gonna do
the thing where I like set an alarm like
if I'm not by my computer when it
launches then it wasn't meant to be
that's kind of how I think of it so if I
happen to be home and I happen to move
I'm a computer at the time that it
launches then I'll go ahead and get on
it and see if I can get it but even
still if I am there right at the actual
second that it goes on sale they're
still really good chance I'm not gonna
get them if I don't get them and I'll
just know it wasn't meant to be and
that's okay and then I will move on but
I'm gonna try I haven't tried to get
anything from Kylie cosmetics and a very
long time like her holiday collection
her round
a collection I have passed over
everything this truly does interest me I
can't say I'm a huge fan of Kim
Kardashian like Khloe was definitely my
favorite sister but Khloe's said even
though I was like yeah Khloe
loved Khloe none of those shades really
interested me so I was like no I'm gonna
pass over it but I just really like
these shades these shades speak to me
I'm curious about this creme creme
liquid formula I'm very curious to see
how that would wear so I'm just I think
yeah I think I'm gonna do it I did the
double take I was looking at the
swatches I've been paying attention to
what they look like the photos I've been
looking up the Kylie cosmetics Instagram
to look at the photos I saw the price
and it made me even more excited so I'm
gonna go for it I'm gonna give it a try
I can make no promises but I'm at least
gonna gonna try and see if I can get the
Kim kardashian-west my Kylie cosmetics
lipsticks let me know if you guys think
do you think I'm crazy did you guys get
excited for it did you do the double
take and you've been looking at the
swatches or am I the only one that's
like super excited about this but I'd
love to know your feedback on this
collaboration were you surprised to see
that Kim did a collaboration with Kylie

anxiously awaiting for it is Kim your
