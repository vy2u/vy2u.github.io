today's video is going to be a new well
I buy it I post my Bolivia videos every
single Wednesday where I'm talking about
new makeup releases and lunges or
wedding you know a little bit about them
and then letting you know if I'm going
to be picking them up or if I'm going to
be passing on them like I said I do post
these will I buy it every single
Wednesday so I will have my playlist
linked down below in case you were
interested in checking out any of the
past will i buy it videos addition to my
will advice videos on Wednesdays I also
post on Thursdays Sundays and Mondays so
you do get videos from me at least four
times a week sometimes the bonus video
is thrown in as well but it leads to
four times a week you get a video from
me so I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button and
becoming a part of the famine getting
notified when I post my new videos but I
always have a lot to talk about in my
Bolivia videos so why don't we go ahead
and get started okay I got quite a few
tags on this first wind-up geek
Cosmetics is coming out with a new in
the nude collection so a lot of times I
say my really white videos that i am
reading off of the trend mood 1
instagram page so i always have her
instagram linked down below
I love the tried weed one Instagram page
I go there very very frequently and a
lot of times I am reading off her
information because she has such good
information on makeup releases so she is
always linked down below but makeup geek
is coming out in the new collection
which is an eyeshadow palette it's going
to be $50 and it includes 9 different
eyeshadows so 4 of them are new map
shades and then 5 of the most popular
Mac shimmery and a foiled eyeshadows is
what is included in that palette for $50
so the shades are pale buffed creased
dark ropes Rapunzel in the spotlight tan
lines cabin fever and grandstand so you
get the nine shades for $50 I'll have
inserted pictures down here but of
course it's called in the news
collections are all very nude neutral
type of shades now it's interesting with
makeup geeks because I do have a little
V palette with nine different makeup
geek eyeshadows I think or seven I
purchased from makeup geek way back in
the day like before I started my channel
because Jaclyn hill was talking about
them one time and she did like a whole
video about her favorite makeup geek
eyeshadows and
went out and bought a bunch and I liked
them but for some reason I'm not like a
total diehard makeup geek gal I'm not
sure why because I know it gets really
decent hype I know they have a lot of
big youtubers that they collaborate with
and I see the other youtubers talking
with our products and then of course I
also see the smaller youtubers just
completely raising about Amaya so many
youtube friends that just have amazing
thing to say about makeup geek but I
don't know for some reason I've tried
them and I like them and I use my makeup
geek single shadows quite frequently but
it just doesn't scream out to me every
time I don't know how better to explain
it but I just don't do a double-take a
lot I don't do the side eye a lot which
I talked about in my lullaby videos just
something about the brand doesn't it's
just told me in like authors do so
that's the best way I can describe how I
feel about makeup geek and I always say
like all I need time on Wikipedia and
you trim or mega peak and then I just
don't do it I know probably a big reason
to is because you can only find them on
the makeup geek website which will have
a listed down below and a lot of times I
say about my purchases for our places
like Sephora and Ulta that offer like
the rewards program even tart now I just
placed an order with Tarte they have a
rewards program to which I was pretty
impressed about it I don't believe
makeup geek does so I just I don't know
I think that's probably a big reason and
then I just kind of feel like what they
come out with I can get them other
places too so I know that's kind of my
thoughts on makeup geek like totally
nothing against them I know Marlena is
the master behind makeup geek and she's
a girl boss and which i think is amazing
so I always want to support makeup do
for some reason I just could never quite
hit that button but so this in the nude
palette I do not have any of the shades
mentioned in here and like I said
probably because I'm not a huge
supporter I guess of makeup geek
actually the only eyeshadow that I've
heard of is grandstand which is
described as a foiled medium warm tan I
hear really amazing things about that
foiled shadow album honestly I'm really
leaning towards getting this which is
interesting cuz I I know I say a lot of
have an eyeshadow palette junkie even
though the eyeshadow palette collection
is saying right now but even with that
like this is deaf
just a me i shadow pellet you know just
looking at the photos it definitely is a
palette that I feel like I could get
along with I like the open nine shades
are in there it seems like it'd be
really easy to travel with so they
didn't look like it comes with a mirror
which i think is awesome so the
packaging is definitely very cool it's
kind of expensive though and I don't
know it would make a peak first started
I guess I thought that they were
affordable and I think someone mentioned
once that like Marlena has addresses
somewhere about the prices going up but
if you think about it fifty dollars for
nine eyes shadow is really expensive
I just paid 46 dollars for the new Tarte
clay play palette and that has like eyes
shadow
and contour shades and bronzers and a
lot of different shades in there so
fifty dollars for nine it's actually in
my opinion that's pretty pricey
that being said I feel like I kind of
talked myself into it when I first was
looking at a house first thing down to
film because I was like I've always said
I wanted to purchase more makeup geek
urging is super pretty I like how the
palette looks I like the mirror I like
the shades they are definitely me shades
but because they're new shades I also
have a ton of them in my collection as
well I'm the only ones that I feel like
I really don't have would probably be
those really foiled shadows but still
I'm sure I have really comparable shapes
and other palettes but I think now what
has made me talk myself out of it is the
$50.00 for nine shades it just doesn't
seem worth it to me it's interesting
because when I first started this out I
thought I was going to go ahead and say
I was going to buy it as I've been
talking about it I looked it just talked
to myself out of it so there you go um
that's kind of the point of these will I
buy at videos it should just think
through think through your collections
think through if you really need it
think through if it really makes you do
that double take and I decided this
one's not going to be for me so yeah I'm
going to pass over the in the nude
collection from makeup geek well like I
said I know there's a ton of people who
just absolutely love makeup geek and
want to get everything from them so let
us know if you're going to get the in
the new collection if you are super
excited for it and you absolutely must
have it as says that it is releasing at
the same Expo in LA June at 10:00 and
11:00 and then it will be available
online for everyone on June 15th
so I'll have that information list in
the description box below so I'll but
let us know if you absolutely have to
have this
the nude palette from makeup geek wood
I'm going to go ahead and pass over it
so I was getting quite a few tags on
this one on instagram as well as a
collection of nude lipsticks how do you
guys know what is that me I'm like who
do I like to do the six right but over
cosmetics has come out with a new new
liquid lipsticks set so the new set
includes three different shades Dubai
bel-air in Manila which is a new shade
to them the set is of forty nine dollars
and seventy cents I'm looking at the
over website you can also buy each of
these shades individually for nineteen
ninety trend mood on her Instagram it
says that she does have a code so you
can use trend mood for thirty percent
off your purchase at Oprah so I'll have
that link down below as well very 970 I
know I did the math earlier now I can't
quite remember I think it was like
thirty five dollars that it would come
out too if you use the thirty percent
off code I know sometimes people get mad
over a zillion coats which makes like no
sense to me because I'm the person that
like refuses to pay full price I always
try to find some sort of coupon code out
there too so would people get mad at
affiliate cause I'm like no please keep
bringing them I don't like spoonful of
rice to things like that is not the
world that I want to live in so I'll
have her code listed down below as well
so I'm really thinking about trying this
and when it was first when it was like
the $50 or whatever for the three shades
I was like and then I reverted the
calculation so I'm pretty sure it came
out to around $35 which is like what
just over ten dollars create shade so
then I was like okay and I'll have the
photos insert it down here below but I
really like how all of the swatches look
they are definitely different news which
I think maybe you might just have to be
a nude lipstick lover to understand that
these are different news because like
what the Kim kardashian-west and Kylie
cosmetics News said everybody was like
they look the same and then there's
those true nude lovers that are like
these are totally different and I feel
like people might think the same thing
with the Oprah's because you can tell
that they're similar but it's just like
looking at the swatch Lois I'm like no
they're completely different I keep
saying that I want to try more from
Oprah as well I do actually probably
enough this was totally not planned
because I did my makeup has been figured
out what I was talking about for this
video but I have an Oprah lip liner on
during an Oprah lip liner in silk i line
my lips with it and then fill them
and then I have a makeup addict look
what lipstick on top of it but that's
kind of funny I feel like that's like
fate right like I should buy it now
because I honestly had no idea what I
was talking about for this will I buy a
video did all of my makeup and then
researched and was doing all that fun
stuff so like I feel like it's meant to
be now because that's just like too
crazy of a coincidence because you can
see I still have like it's a plastic on
it I was trying so hard to give it off
with my tweezers today but it was the
first time I've uses I've had this for a
while it came in one of my makeup
subscription bags and I just don't wear
a lip liner a lot and I'm finding myself
wearing look later more lately I
literally used it for the first time
today I was like oh I haven't used that
over run out I should I feel like I just
talked myself into it because that's
just like too weird of a coincidence now
so I think I'm just going to try it I
love lipsticks I know that they'll get
used out of me I love news they're just
what I'm reaching for a ton and I've
been hearing good things about really
over in general but also there were
liquid lipsticks someone just made a
comment one of my past videos that I
really should try an Oprah liquid
lipstick so for like the $35 or whatever
it is after a code I think I would just
purchased the whole new set of them
because really even if I just wanted to
pick like one or two colors I really do
enjoy them all and I think I would like
all of them so I think I'm going to get
it why not I think I'm going to get it
because you know I just don't have
enough lipsticks in my life especially
nude lipsticks I just need to add more
you know when I first started looking at
it I thought it was a good deal anyways
and something that I definitely will get
use out of and use and I'm excited to
try a new formula of a liquid lipstick
so I can review it and let you guys know
my thoughts on it but yeah I'm going to
I'm going to pick up this Oprah nude
liquid lipstick at Rio I'll have it
linked down below because it is already
for sale let us know have you tried the
ofra liquid lipstick in the past you
absolutely love it or you want to pick
up this new trio or any of the
individuals in the trio let us know in
the comments down below I got a lot of
tags on this next one a lot of tags on
Instagram a lot sent to my snapchat
directly I know a lot of people must be
very very excited about this so Lexi
Beauty is coming out with a
collaboration with a Wonder Woman the
Wonder Woman movie is coming to
if it's not out yet it's coming very
soon I remember when I thought Beauty
and the Beast we watched the trailer for
Wonder Woman and there it looks like an
amazing amazing movie I'm totally want
to see it but this is the collaboration
between that Warner Brothers
entertainment and Alexei Beauty I do
have several luck see Beauty brushes and
I really love them all so this is a
limited edition set as most collabs are
it comes with a warrior mirror compact
and then the brushes that are included
are a flat kabuki a beauty buffer and
angled buffer a tapered kabuki and a fan
brush and then for the full set is and
$95 the picture insurgent down here
below it looks very cool okay like it
looks very cool a collaboration with
Wonder Woman very cool I was excited for
the lorac and Pirates of the Caribbean
collection and this one definitely made
me do a side a I won't say it wasn't a
full double take but it's more of like
the side I definitely was that being
said and that being said that I liked
Luxy brushes $95 is pretty expensive to
me for five face brushes and then a
compact mirror I talked about these
Storybrook cosmetics the rose brush set
in a past will a buy a video and it was
like fifty five dollars for four or five
brushes I think it was and I was saying
that I thought that was a little bit on
the price set as well so $95 I
understand what you're paying for I
understand you're paying for the
collaboration I understand like I get it
it's just going to be too expensive for
me it really is and I just don't need
makeup brushes like I need to reign it
in somehow on buying makeup brushes this
is out of hand if you're on my snapchat
I think you've seen them and I think
I've shared them on Instagram as well or
somewhere but my makeup brush collection
is just out of control I just don't need
any at this time so definitely one of my
weaknesses when it comes to makeup
shopping but that being said I just
can't spend ninety five dollars on side
brushes I just I just can't do it
knowing how many brushes I have knowing
that I have every single brush that is
pictured here I have all of those types
of brushes like 95 is just too much
money for me to spend so even though I'm
super interested in the collaboration I
think it looks great I like Lexi brushes
up super excited for the Wonder Woman
movie all of those things added together
I just don't need it for my collection
and it's just
too much money for me so I'm going to
have to pass over the Lexi Beauty and
Wonder Woman brush collection super sad
about it but I just had know in my heart
that's the right thing to do so let us
know in the comments down below though
are you so excited for this
collaboration I feel like a lot of you
guys are because I got so many so many
types on this one so let us know in the
comments down below or are you excited
to see Wonder Woman because I definitely
if the trailer got me pretty excited for
it also let us know you're going to see
the movie and then your thoughts on the
brush collection so the last one is the
one I got the most tags on and it's kind
of interesting because I thought to
myself I am NOT going to feature this
product in a bullet by a video unless a
lot of people ask me about it because of
course even if I feel like I'm talking
about a brand elad or certain products a
lot as people are really asking for the
texture coming in the stamps are coming
in I am going to talk about it because I
want to talk about what you guys want to
see in these videos you know why I make
them and yes everybody was asking me
about the new Koko collection in
collaboration with Kylie cosmetics I
wasn't really going to talk about them
because I just purchased the Kim
kardashian-west was Kylie cosmetics
collection I have a full video about
that and then I also talked about Kylie
cosmetics and her new velvet lips in my
last aintry haul video I believe it was
so I was like I don't know I don't feel
like I really need to touch on it and
then when so many tags were coming in I
was like alright I'll talk about it I
see you guys but so once again Khloe
Kardashian is teaming up with sir Kylie
Jenner and Kylie cosmetics they are
coming out with a gay part - Coco
collection she released I believe was a
four piece lipstick collection in the
past and now they are coming out with a
new collection so it includes a pressed
powder palette with blush bronzer and
two highlighters plus the init love with
Coco liquid lip collection so there's a
matte liquid lipsticks and glosses
included in the lip collection so the
liquid lipsticks didn't really catch my
eyes are just not the shades that I
would wear and I said that in the past
with the Coco collection as well I
wanted to buy that original Coco
collection because like if I had to pick
a Kardashian sister to call my favorite
not like
they want to hang out with its Chloe but
then when Tim released the nudes I'm
like well I'm kind of a sucker for nude
lips so what do you do but you have
these shades like one looks almost like
a deep like purple love and then like
red just darker shades and then there's
a gloss in there it just you know it
doesn't interest me enough but the face
palette did actually kind of make me do
a double-take because I've never really
seen anything like this in this type of
packaging from Kylie cosmetics like I
know that she offers different palettes
now with life lessons and stuff inside
but like this particular packaging and
how it was laid out made me do a little
bit of a side eye but I quickly I
quickly quickly talk to myself out of it
like I said I did just talk about Kylie
cosmetics in my last day haul and
because I purchased the Kim
kardashian-west collection it just
completely turns me off Kylie cosmetics
again not that I didn't like the product
editing receives because I actually
really do I really do like those
criminal is what lipstick so I can wear
them pretty frequently you see me on
snapchat wearing them a lot I love all
the nude shades
I like the formula because I don't
always have the time to apply a liquid
lipstick and like give the attention and
the time to applying a liquid lipstick I
just want something really quick or if
I'm going to film and I know I need to
wash my makeup off it just seems kind of
pointless to put on the liquid lipstick
so definitely been reaching for those a
lot but just like the customer service
this shipping times just how kind of the
cosmetics continues to do business just
completely turns me off and I just don't
want to purchase I don't want to support
it and I just don't really want anything
to do with it at this time I'd been
unhappy with Kylie cosmetics in the past
and with some shipping issues and things
like that and then I mean I weighed it
probably like a year to repurchase from
her and it's really just because the
nude set really caught my attention but
it took like was it nine days for it to
ship out to me it was an extremely long
time they launched the Kim
kardashian-west collection on a Tuesday
then they relaunched that Friday without
shipping any orders it seems like from
Tuesday it just didn't make any sense
like to me and this might sound really
stupid so people might be like oh well
of course and then other people might be
like you don't know her but it's to meet
Kylie
makes cares about money and moving
products more than she does about actual
customers if they're happy if they're
satisfied and it just was so many makeup
brands out there and makeup companies
and more entrepreneurs and girl bosses
that were going out there and like
chasing their dreams and working their
asses off to make it come true it kind
of gave me a pause like well then why am
i supporting that like it just kind of
made me re-evaluate and I just have to
think back to like the Carli bybel BH
Cosmetics collaboration when I was
having issues with it I can have the
video list it down below I was having
issues with it and Carli bybel is right
there right there helping me out
tweeting me direct messaging me helping
me get it figured out getting me my
order like she is someone who cares
about her customers and I just don't see
it from Kylie cosmetics maybe some of
you guys see it and maybe some of the
guys think differently but just my
opinion and how I think so
I just can't in good faith purchase from
the company right now again maybe I'll
change my mind in the future maybe I'll
try again next year I don't know I don't
feel like I hold grudges forever but at
this time I it's just not something that
I want to do and like I said in my aunt
at hall it would be absolutely
ridiculous with me to complain about the
shipping times and to complain about the
customer service and to complain about
the way they do business and then turn
around and buy something from them again
because then if I have issues the next
time I order with customer service or
shipping times or whatever it is how can
I then complain about it because I knew
you know I've already had an experience
so why would I just go ahead and do it
again just week later it wouldn't make
any sense to me so I'm not going to be
purchasing the Coco collection on the
lipsticks is nothing for me the face
palette I mean I think it was just the
packaging that got my attention at first
when I actually like looked at the
shades and you know thought about what
it is that I need in my collection it's
not this I'm passing over all of it it
will be available on may 31st so the day
that this video goes up it'll be
available at 3 p.m. PST just I just
can't do it I just can't do it myself so
let me know what you think in the
comments down below I don't need to like
be super controversial or negative or
anything like that I'm just telling you
my feelings my feedback and why I'm not
going to buy it and why I'm not going to
purchase the from this company but I
would love to know your guys's thoughts
- I know that there's so many Kylie
Jenner supporter
out there and people that absolutely
love cotton cosmetics and people who
just don't care like they have issues
with shipping too and it doesn't matter
they still order everything so I just
would love to know your guys's opinions
and feedback as well I just think it's
really interesting I love to have
conversations with you guys in the
comments I do read and respond to all of
them and I really do appreciate them so
leave me some comments down below let me
know what you think about this
collection with Kylie cosmetics it's not
going to do it for the speaks of what I
buy it video I really hope that you
enjoyed it and found it helpful or
entertaining in some way again make sure
