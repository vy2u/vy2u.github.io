today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm planning on picking them up or
passing over them like I said I do post
these every single Wednesday so I will
have my playlist a link down below and
in addition to that I am currently
posting every single day which is a bit
overwhelming but there's just so much to
talk about and I'm actually kind of
loving posting every single day it's a
lot of work for I'm also having a lot of
fun on Wednesdays is my will i buy it
series i typically post a vlog on
fridays and then tuesdays i do a live
stream at 4 o'clock is CST but yes i do
have a lot of content so i hope that you
will consider hitting the subscribe
button if you like daily videos and if
you like a lot of chatter about makeup
and beauty but as always with my will
advice videos i do have a lot to talk
about this week
so why don't I go ahead and get started
and a ton of people tagging me on some
new releases from pur cosmetics I think
a lot of you know that I really love
Pierre and that I've gravitated towards
since my college days away before
YouTube foods and I just really like a
lot their products I have a lot from
here I have a whole Pierre cosmetics
collection video that I did like back in
January that I can leave a post it down
below so they just came out with a new
eyeshadow palette a contour palette a
new eyeliner and a new liquid eyeliner
so new island has pencil and then a new
liquid liner ok guys a lot insert some
photos down below like I normally do so
the eyeshadow palettes or a diary's for
a diary's eye that is a word that I
can't say never really but I will say
that so now you guys know but that is
$29
so the packaging looks really pretty
like that white marble I think is really
really gorgeous so I don't but I can't
and I don't know the palette didn't make
me do a double-take to be honest and
then I saw it and I looked at it some
more $29 I don't think it's a bad price
it didn't make me do a double take right
away but as I looked at it more I almost
kind of did that thing where I wanted to
talk myself into it because I thought
$29 was in a bad price I do like pure
eyeshadows I love the trolls palette
I've had so much fun with that pow
but I really want a pictures in it
doesn't make me do a double-take don't
get it because I already have so much
makeup but they look the shape doulas
pretty and they're all very neutral
which is me so I'm kind of confused why
I didn't do a double-take but hey I mean
you can't control the double-take you
guys you can't control what's going to
happen or not it just happens so you
know it really just it just didn't
really catch my eye all that much the
swatches do look very pretty but I also
haven't seen a ton about it I haven't
seen a lot of review videos I just all
appear on snapchat so I've only seen
like a handful and I want to say like
two maybe three takeovers or people who
are using the palette and I really pay
attention when they works out like right
you can change my mind but I don't know
it just kind of looked a little like
mist to me so I'm not going to get that
and then we go over to the contour
palette which is $32 for six different
shades again I this one excited me a
little bit more because I really do like
contour I think they're all powder
shades I believe I only have like a good
mixture in there but I don't know it's
kind of weird because I like contour
pellets but at the same time I feel bad
sometimes getting them because there's
always those like 2 or 3 shades I just
don't work for me it's hard to make a
contour palette where all the shades
work for everybody I get maybe like
they're supposed to be like universal so
no matter if you get it no matter what
your skin tone is you're going to have
those one to two shades in there that
work for you but then at the same time
I'm like instead silly and is that a
waste of money
no no but again it just didn't it just
didn't scream my name so I'm not going
to be able to do it the collection also
included a new eyeliner pencil and a new
liquid liner I don't think I've tried
the pure liquid liners but I actually
have one of their on point eyeliners on
my eyes right now I just talked about it
in my previous haul video I think it was
that went up yesterday and I'm really
impressed with that eyeliner I don't
know if this isn't on I know it says on
point I learned a pencil okay so it must
be that I mean I'm probably not going to
pick it up as a part of this collection
but I do like their eyeliners and if I
would need to replace an eyeliner I
think I would definitely go for
a pure eyeliner because I found them to
be really good I don't find them to be
as great as with a Marc Jacobs I don't
think that has the long-lasting power of
Marc Jacobs but it was still really
creamy really pigmented and dusty in the
waterline very well I do like their
eyeliners but I'm going to pass over
this new collection from Pierre I'm kind
of bummed because I do like the brand
and I was excited to see the release but
then when I saw the products they just
they just didn't scream my name enough
for me to purchase them when there's
also you know so many other releases
that I would rather spend my money on
the makeup that really does call out to
me so even though I do like Pierre as a
brand and the packaging definitely
caught my eye I'm going to pass over
this collection but let us know in the
comments down below if you are planning
on getting this or if you already have
gotten it I believe it is only available
at pur cosmetics right now I did not see
it on also website when I sat down to
film but I'll have it listed down below
in low snow your thoughts on this
collection from Pierre I got quite a few
tags on Instagram from this new
collection from Oprah cosmetics it's
their summer 2017 collection island time
collection so it has three new blushes
that are each $29 there's also a new
highlighter which is $35 and apparently
$29 at all so I'm looking at the tread
mood and Sue gram page will be linked it
down below like usual you lip trill the
island time trio which includes two maps
and a new metallic liquid lipstick and
it's 49 70 or $35 at Ulta or $17 if you
get the lipsticks individually okay
let's see here so so Oprah blushes
they're $29 each I'm going to pass over
them for some reason I've been more on
like the blush palette type of scent
like I like getting more than one in
blush and then more than one single
blush I've been just gravitating lard
towards my blush palette so I really
don't feel like I need a single blush I
also did just get the beauty into these
cheek palette from lorac cosmetics again
that was in my haul video yesterday so
I'm super excited to try that so I feel
pretty good about my blush situation at
the time the new highlighter which is
$35 or $29 at Ulta I do not need a new
highlighters right now even though I
hear over highlighters are the bomb I'm
going to get them at some point but
probably not right now so I have too
many highlighters and then be
a lipstick trio which is $35 is also or
$17 individually I mean it comes with
the to match but then it comes with a
metallic liquid lipstick and I said
before like that's just not really my I
of the metallic lips so the trio
wouldn't really work out for me I
actually did just get three liquid
lipsticks from ultra the news trio
talked about it on the whole video
yesterday but I've been having a really
good time with them and we really love
in the formulas I do like the Oprah
liquid lipsticks and I would totally
stand by them like I would refer to self
or a liquid lipstick now that I've been
able to try them but I don't think that
I need him at this time again if you
guys on one haul video I have just been
completely rained on it with lipsticks
right now I mean just just rained with
lipsticks
it's insane not saying that I'm not
going to buy them I can't put myself on
a lipstick no buy like I cannot
highlight no buy I just not physically
able to do that because I'm a lipstick
junkie but I know that I just got a lot
of new lipsticks so because this one
didn't really call my name I know that I
can easily pass over it so I'm not going
to get anything from the Oprah
collection either again I've been buying
a lot of makeup when I prepare for they
give away like I'm doing right now with
my 20k giveaway on YouTube will be
linked down below I also buy a lot for
myself as I'm buying for the giveaway so
I have a lot going on and then I've also
recently just had a ton of really
amazing PR come in so I'm a little
overwhelmed at the moment so I think
it's a little easier for me to be saying
no right now because I'm just kind of
like I have love to make up to try and I
really want to try them out so it is a
bit easier for me to be saying no right
now but but again nothing just really
caught my attention like did made me do
that double take so I'm going to go
ahead and pass over the over collection
but I did get a lot of tags so I'd love
to know what you guys think this
collection down in the comments below I
definitely got a ton of tags on this new
collaboration this is a eyeshadow
palette in collaboration with I love
loss and in Nicole Concilio she is a
Instagrammer and also a youtuber so I
will have her channel listed down below
as well so she is coming out with an
eyeshadow palette with a violet box and
includes 20 new shades with different
finishes it will be available on July 12
at 10 a.m. PST and it will be $45
so the shades inside I mean we have a
pretty good range of colors there's
definitely a lot of oranges in there
that I see which i think is you know
pretty on-trend right now there's a
really cool like metallic looking shades
some dual Chrome's I see in there but I
don't think I'm going to get this one I
definitely have a lot of eyeshadow
palettes right now and I'm trying to get
through a lot of like my newer eyeshadow
palettes I do like a violet boss and I
do like their eyeshadows I have the Holy
Grail palette which I absolutely love I
recommend it all the time I think it is
a really really nice I shadow palette
but this one just isn't totally speaking
to me and I know like I said how it has
a lot of these but oranges in there I
just got the Justin home once you tell
it that definitely has a lot of oranges
it has a blue that I see in there it
doesn't necessarily have some of these
like duo crumbs and I'm seeing what you
do look cool but again I just I don't
think that I need it right now and it
didn't make me do a double-take I don't
have to talk myself into it so I do
watch Nicole Concilio I know there's so
many collaborations that I'm like I
don't know who that is because I'm
actually pretty fairly new to just even
watching YouTube not even having a
channel but just watching in general so
I don't quite know everybody in the
beauty community I know shocking we just
simply can't know or follow or watch
everybody but I do watch Nicole I've
been watching her fairly recently and I
do like her I enjoyed her videos but I
don't feel like connection with her like
I do what some of the other youtubers so
I well I'm excited for her and I think
that's like super grade that she's doing
a collaboration it still wasn't enough
to make me be like I have to buy this
one I have to support this one you know
we can't support everybody's
collaborations out there I support a lot
of YouTube collab a lot of times I'm
buying collabs because I want to support
the youtuber or the beauty influencer
who is collaborating but in this case I
don't necessarily feel that 100% still
very excited for Nicole I do like her
videos and like I said I'll have her
channel list down below but it's just
not in decibel pull to me to buy an
eyeshadow palette that I don't think
it's that I necessarily need at this
time but I would love to know what you
guys think like its Nicole ones like
your writer guys were you so excited
when you saw its collaboration again I
got a lot of
Peg's on this one so I feel like a lot
of you are pretty excited to see this
collab but let me know what you think do
you love violet box do you love Nicole
are you definitely planning on
purchasing this on July 12 let us know
in the comments the last item is I
actually had something else I was going
to talk about in this video and it was
maybe like 30 minutes a hora started
filming I started getting a lot of times
because trend mood gs post it like
within the hour about this so the shade
and light glimmer I shadow pellet from
Kat Von D we now have a release date for
it it's going to be available at July
11th at Sephora and then in store on
July 13th so it looks the same as the
shade and light palette which I have and
I absolutely adore but each of the
shades have four different glimmer
finishes so where the original shade and
light palette is all matte this is going
to be all glimmer which is super
interesting and I don't see a price on
it but what was the shade and light
palette it was in the $40 range rate
maybe 46 dollars 48 dollars I want to
say so I'm assuming it will be somewhere
in that same price range so looking at
it like I said I love my shade and light
palette my Shan light palette is a holy
grail to me is when I consistently
recommend to people I absolutely love it
I reach for it so much that being said I
really I don't think I'm going to get
this one and it's mostly because I
definitely gravitate more towards the
mat and all glimmer palette just doesn't
scream out to me I think it would be
really hard to create a full makeup look
I don't it's not impossible you can
definitely create full looks using
shimmers especially depending on what
the heck it is you're doing but for me
and for what I use on a daily basis it
just wouldn't be a practical addition to
my eyeshadow palette family and you know
this was another one like yes it looks
interesting but I didn't see it
immediately be like oh my gosh I need
that because I know that I don't and so
to spend you know 40 some dollars on
another eyeshadow palette it just
doesn't make sense to me at the time
I definitely love makeup eye makeup
addict I love to buy makeup I love to
try different makeup obviously it's a
part of my job now with my youtube
channel to review the makeup but I also
keep in mind that I try to be a smart
shopper sometimes not all the time but I
try to be a smart shopper
I just don't think this one would be a
smart purchase for me so even though it
looks really cool I'd like the idea
behind it I just know that I don't need
it I also have be carving believe in
yourself palette which is all shimmer so
what I know that I just simply don't
need it in my collection is pretty
simple for me to say you know this isn't
for me I'm going to pass on it but again
just within the past hour or so the tags
that have been coming in I think a lot
of you guys are really excited about it
but let us know what you think in the
comments down below of the Kat Von D
shade + light deliver eyeshadow palette
