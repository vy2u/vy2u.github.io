today's video is going to be a new
edition of will i buy it so if you are
new to my channel welcome my name is
Samantha I hope that you will subscribe
down below now only because i have a
huge giveaway going on cuz i'm just
celebrating a book release this month
but also because i post 3242 sometimes
even five days a week I post a lot of
videos because I love them but one
series that I started recently has been
the will i buy it and I absolutely loved
doing it and it seems like a lot of you
guys like it too I get asked a lot of
questions about putting certain products
into the will i buy it videos and I just
really love that people seem excited for
these videos because like I say in each
one it gives me a chance to produce
content without having to actually go
out and buy all of these items because
one of the things that I struggle with
the most is you know not being able to
buy all of the makeup you know because I
can't financially by all of the makeup
and I think a lot of us are probably
like that too so these will i buy it's
basically all I do is I go over usually
it's some sort of like new release and
typically I focus these on high-end
products because that's where it really
comes into play you know can I afford it
do I really need it do I need another
nude lip lipstick in my collection you
know that sort of thing the questions
that we ask ourselves on a daily basis
so I just go through each product share
a picture of it talk about it talk about
the price where to get it if it's
limited edition etc etc etc and then I
go through the reasons of either why i
will be buying it or why I've decided to
skip on it so I will leave my playlist
link down below I have a whole playlist
for my will i buy of videos and then
also my anti haul videos so I'll leave
that link down below in case you guys
might be interested but we have another
five products to talk about and this
will i buy it so why don't I go ahead
and hop into it so the first one that I
want to talk about is from Kylie
cosmetics and it was the cocoa
collection so at the time that i'm
filming it the cocoa collection has
already released it sold out but a
restock is coming thought so i thought i
would still put it in i meant to film
this video about a week prior but with
the support bab sale and stuff i was
just kind of getting those videos done
so i am posting this a little bit later
than I wanted to but the cocoa
collection is still supposed to restock
so I thought I could still share about
it here so basically Kylie cosmetics
Kylie Jenner she is doing her first
collaboration and she teamed up with
step-sister Khloe Kardashian they came
out with the cocoa collection which
included three matte liquid lipsticks
and then one lip gloss and you could get
the entire thing for forty dollars so i
first saw it on Kylie's snapchat and
then you know I saw done Khloe snapchat
about how you know they're Chloe's
favorite colors and you know how she
decided to design them so it came with a
nude a fuchsia like a burgundy and then
like a shimmery peachy pink lip gloss as
well and so when I first saw it come out
I was like oh my gosh Chloe's my
favorite like if you are going to say
like you need to spend one day with the
kardashian-jenner which one are you
choosing like I'm choosing Chloe seven
out of seven days of the week so I was
really excited when I saw that and then
I'm thinking oh my gosh how expensive is
this going to be like what what's the
price going to be and they come on and
they say forty dollars and I'm like Mike
do forty dollars that doesn't sound like
a bad price at all and then she says on
top of that I don't know this is going
to be forever now or if it's just a
limited edition thing but on the website
today it still says it that you get free
shipping in the US for orders over forty
dollars and so not only if you purchase
the collection you would get free
shipping and that was my always just my
biggest complaint about Kylie cosmetics
I don't think her her products are
priced abnormally high I think to
purchase a single liquid lipstick is
seventeen dollars to purchase an Anasazi
or kat von d is twenty dollars so I
don't think her products are priced
wrong but she was charging like nine to
ten dollars for shipping even if you
just bought one lipstick you had to pay
that much in shipping and I just I don't
like paying for shipping that's not the
world I want to live in it's just not
and so that was always the reason why I
would hold back and so when I saw that
you could get the three matte liquid
lipsticks and the lip gloss all for
forty dollars and get free shipping i
was like yep summit yep mmm yep I'll buy
him I'll get him I'll buy him and
in the day that it released i think it
was three o'clock my time so 255 I'm on
my computer i'm also on snapchat
watching and Kylie starts putting like
the liquid lipsticks on her lips because
she starts saying like oh you guys
wanted to see me and them and the first
two colors that she had on I was like
what I don't think I actually like those
colors like I'm ready to go I have my
credit card out i'm on the website
waiting for it to go live and all of a
sudden I'm like in panic mode because
I'm like wait I get huius like it I
really did pay attention to what the
actual shades look like I was just like
yeah I'm gonna buy it like that's what
went through my mind so then I'm
freaking out so then I start I run over
to the Instagram real quick and I'm
looking at the swatches on the Instagram
and i'm watching Kylie's snapchats at
the same time and I'm like I think I
only like the nude I thought the fuchsia
was too bright for me the burgundy it's
not something I wear on a daily basis
and i already have burgundy and dark
lipsticks and then the lip gloss i just
didn't really love all like the shimmer
to it so I'm like wait a second now I'm
gonna pay forty dollars for a new
lipstick no no no I can't do this and so
I froze and like I said like the
countdowns coming on so I froze and i
was like maybe i shouldn't do it I
shouldn't do it and you know what I'm
kind of glad that I decided not to
because apparently of course with so
many of the Kylie launches it was a
complete disaster and everybody was
angry it sold out in five minutes you
were having to like be put in a line
when you were on the website and it just
sounded like a mess and so I'm like you
well you know what I probably wouldn't
have gotten them anyways this was how
the launch went so it's fine but I took
some more time and thought about it and
looked at the hood jurist because they
said they were going to restock it once
and I was like let me look again and
just make sure and just the shades don't
speak to me as much as I want them to I
got excited because of Chloe I got
excited cuz of the price I got excited
for the free shipping but they're
actually not like what lipsticks that
like I completely one hundred percent
prefer and really really want so there's
my story and this was one that I really
thought I was gonna buy it I chickened
out at last minute I didn't do it and
actor some more research I decided that
was the best idea I'm gonna pass on the
cocoa collection the next time it
launches but I want to know did you guys
get it because I know a lot of people
are really excited about it and with how
quick it sold out
some of you had to have gotten it so let
us know your thoughts down below okay
and then moving along a lot of people
asked what my thoughts were on the
colour-pop and Hello Kitty collaboration
again this is a club that already came
out and I kind of sold out of mostly
everything I'm looking at the website
now there is still a few stuff in stock
but it also says it will be restocking
November 16th and this video should
already be up by then so a restock is
coming but basically colour-pop teamed
up with Hello Kitty and came out with a
collab so there's like the cute Hello
Kitty packaging they have like I shadows
blushes I mean highlighters lippies you
name it it's in their summer and kit
somewhere in sets some you can buy
individually I you know I like color pop
and I like that they're affordable
because they're affordable but also
still really good like I like the
eyeshadows I like the blushes I'll just
satin lips were my new favorites like I
thought I like the ultra matte lips but
ultra satin lips are really really good
what I don't like about color pop is
nearly it just it feels like everything
that they come out with is limited
edition and limited edition when you're
a blogger is a really really hard to
justify at least to me it's hard for me
to justify spending the money on it
because when you then try to use it in
tutorials are you showing in pictures
people are mad because they can't get it
and you know maybe it was a launch where
they really wanted it but it's filled
out too fast and they couldn't get and
they're still mad at it and then you're
posting pictures like a look at me was
my cool hello kitty color pop lipstick
and that people are mad at you so it's
really hard like I have the sweet peach
pilot from to face and I know I come
back to that one a lot but every time I
post a tutorial or I'll look with it
people are frustrated and people are
asking you know do you know when it's
coming back and stock and people get mad
at me like I didn't make it come out of
stock I'm not the one who did the
inventory for it but people still get
mad at the bloggers so I don't know what
it is but it's really hard for me in my
mind to justify spending money on
something that's limited edition and I
know that I'm not just going to be able
to use it as freely as I can as
something that doesn't come limited
edition and just it just seems like was
so much of color pop and their collabs
and all that just everything is so
limited edition and everything sells out
so fast and
honestly it's just really frustrating to
me I appreciate that color pop is more
affordable and if you're not a logger
and you're not a youtuber definitely
check out color pop I think it would be
fantastic i think you would really like
it like I said they're affordable and
great and it's fantastic but as a
vlogger I can't just keep piling up my
makeup collection with limited edition
at this stage of where I am like maybe
down the road someday where it really is
like doesn't matter maybe I can but at
the stage where I am I just can't keep
cluttering my collection with limited
edition that I then cannot use for
tutorials and photos on YouTube and
Instagram if that makes sense so um
honestly I'm also probably like one of
the only people that doesn't feel a real
pole when it comes to hello kitty I've
never owned anything hello kitty I don't
really know much about hello kitty I'm
not I'm not gonna live so when I saw
that that cloud was coming out I was
like well I know that I'm gonna be
passing over that one but of course as
always did you guys get anything from
the Hello Kitty clap let us know in the
comments okay speaking of two-faced
let's talk about these new chocolate
chip palettes because everybody's asked
me this one is probably the most asked
about to do it in my next will i buy it
so two-faced announced recently that
they are coming out with these chocolate
chip palettes I'll put photos in here so
you can see them basically they have a
dark chocolate chip palette and then
they have a white chocolate chip palette
now each of these are like little mini
palettes you know to face is known for
their chocolate bar palette they have
like the semi-sweet chocolate bar the
chocolate bar do they have a dark
chocolate bar I don't even know but
they're very well known for their
chocolate bar palette so now they're
coming out with these mini palettes
there's 11 shades in each so the dark
chocolate is an all matte eyeshadow
palette and this one is going to be
exclusive on the two-faced website the
white chocolate is a mixture of shimmer
in math and this one will be exclusive
at Sephora at the time that i'm filming
no price has been released yet I've
looked everywhere no price has been
released but if by the time I put this
video up if the prices have come out I
will insert them somewhere here in this
video if not when the prices do come out
I will update the description box down
below so the prices are in there so i do
not own any of the chocolate bar palette
from Too Faced i own none of them and i
know it's crazy everybody loves them
everybody talks about them I really
want to get like this is a straight
chocolate bar palette I always had my
eye on it but I've never purchased it
from myself yet but it's something that
I hope to do so these mini palettes I
think are super cute I'm not gonna lie I
think they're super cute at the time
that i'm filming it is pretty new news i
mean it's probably within the week that
i'm filming that I saw these come out
and I saw the photos of them and we you
know was kind of able to start making my
decisions i wish the prices would be on
there I think the regular chocolate bar
pellets are around forty nine dollars so
I'm assuming maybe it'll be like in the
20s somewhere around that range I don't
know if it's a complete guess i'm not
sure but i think that i want to get one
and i think i'm leaning on getting the
white chocolate palette I love Matt
palace I really do so that's why i
thought that i would initially go
towards the dark chocolate but i really
love what the shimmer shades look like
in the white chocolate palette and i
like that you get a mixture I have
several all Matt pallets already so I
kind of like that you're getting the
mixture in this one so as of right now
you know it is definitely pending on
price but i'm leaning on getting the
white chocolate bar palette not so much
of the dark chocolate unless you know
something really crazy happens to change
my mind but i think i'm definitely
leaning on the white chocolate palette
to pick up and these will become
available again dark chocolate on to
face calm and the white chocolate on
sephora.com and they will both be
available november 25th which is black
friday a crazy day so that's when they
will be available like i said i'll leave
the prices in the description box below
if i find out before i put this video up
or I'll just update the description box
but I'm leaning towards white chocolate
I really think that's going to be a
purchase that I get I just think it just
think it looks so cute chocolate chip
palette I just oh I just love it but let
me know what you guys think I've missed
out on all the other chocolate bar so
this is what I kind of want to get one
from this collection so I haven't seen
if these are limited-edition I truly
don't know if they will be limited
edition or not looking at jared's I'm
Instagram page was reading a lure and
bustle no one has said anything about
limited edition but no one has said it's
not limited edition so that part i'm not
sure about but let me know what you guys
think too is there one pallet you're
leaning towards do you want to get both
of them let me know what you think
anyone
do any price guessing let me know but
again the chocolate chip pellets will be
lunching on November 25th so the last
one that I want to talk about a
subscriber let me know that violent
floss is going to be restocking their
Holy Grail I shadow palette so I have
never purchased anything from violet
boss but I always hear about the Holy
Grail I shadow palette and it's been out
of stock I mean I think for a very very
long time because i remember when i
started seeing a lot of people using it
i looked it up and it was out of stock
and that was like months ago and i've
never heard about another restock so I
had someone mentioned in my last bill i
buy a video that hey this holy grail
pallets coming back and stop do you
think you will buy it so I've been
looking it up and on the violet boss
Instagram it said it's going to be
restocked on November eighteenth and
start shipping out November 28th so I am
very curious about this one though it
has 20 different eyeshadows and it's a
mixture between Matt and shimmers it's
$45 and this palette looks beautiful
like when I said I started seeing people
using it a lot the reason why my
interest was so sparked and why I went
and looked it up and then saw it was out
of stock was because I thought the
shadows looked so completely gorgeous so
borgeous so I'm thinking about it I'm
going you know decided in my mind what
is it that you want to do I'm looking at
the vial of Oz Instagram and then I'm
looking up the Holy Grail palette I'm
looking up tutorials I'm looking up
swatches and I'm seeing what people
think and like majority I mean when I
say in some of these will i buy it at my
anti hell videos I'm like the majority
of reviews are people don't like it or
people do like it it's not i'm not
saying that that's everybody I'm saying
majority for a reason like some people
leave comments on here like well I have
that palette and i love it and you said
the majority people didn't like it yes
the majority of people i'm never going
to say there's just one opinion on one
thing like that's just not the case so
please don't think i'm saying that but
the majority of people seem to really
love this holy girl eyeshadow palette
some thinking and I'm thinking and I've
really been wanting to purchase from
violet boss for a while they have some
really awesome false lashes that I've
been wanting to get but I'm like I don't
know I don't know and now i'm really
considering getting the
grown palette ordering a couple lashes
just trying out violet boss as a brand
because I haven't tried them out yet
before so please let me know your guys
opinions on this one because you know
I'm making these videos but I'm also
coming to you guys for your opinions and
your feedback and I really do value that
and I read all of your comments I
respond to all of your comments and I
think it's really helpful so do you guys
have the Holy Grail palette and would
you recommend it I really want to know
because right now I'm leaning towards
yes and i'm not a huge I shadow palette
person a lot of times when I talk about
eyeshadow palettes I'm like I'm not
going to buy him because i'm not a huge
a shuttle pilot junkie but this one has
definitely definitely caught my eye I
worry about it getting sold out again
because even on the violet box Instagram
when they did announce it everybody was
already going crazy for it like oh my
gosh can't believe this is coming back
in stock so I'm like ah is it worth it
to get the limited edition palette but
you know we always going to make
concessions somewhere and I'm wondering
if this could be a concession that I
make let me know let me know if you
think the Holy Grail is worth it and let
me know if there's anything else from
pilot boss that you think is absolutely
amazing because I would love to make
like kind of more of a bulk purchase
order from by lafosse so I could really
give the brain to try and be able to
give my feedback and review on it but
right now I have five more days to make
up my mind and see you know maybe the
launch will go something crazy like it's
sold out in five minutes and you know I
don't even get it but right now i'm
definitely leaning towards yes unwind
the Holy Grail palette it looks so nice
it looks so nice it really does and I've
just seen so many good things about this
palette so I'm really am considering
getting the violet boss palette let me
know your guys is opinion on that guys
