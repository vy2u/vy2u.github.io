today's video is going to be a new will
I bias I post my weather bite videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about
new makeup releases and launches letting
you know a little bit about them and
letting you know if I'm going to pick
them up or if I'm going to pass over
them like I said I do post these videos
every single Wednesday I do have a
playlist I'll leave that link down below
so you just that you can catch any of my
past will i buy videos and then in
addition to my Wednesday will I buy as I
also post on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays I do a livestream on Tuesdays at
4:00 p.m. CST and then sometimes you get
bonus videos from me as well but you at
least get four videos from me a week in
one livestream on Tuesday so I really
hope that you will consider hitting the
subscribe button before you leave during
the family get notified when I post my
videos or when I go live but I would
really appreciate it if you did
subscribe before you go but we
definitely have a lot to talk about this
week so why don't we go ahead and get
started all right so first I want to
start with dubious place I was getting a
ton of tags on their new Zulu eye
palette so this ayat' allah' is six
matte shades and three metallics i will
have a photo inserted below like i
normally do
so the Zulu eye palette I was looking on
their website is 1750s attended and
filming it's in stock it's available to
add a tour to your bag so there's a six
mat and three metallics they are
definitely very bright and vibrant a
yellow hot orange and then the metallics
are really pretty blues and greens it's
a very very eye-catching palette and I
know as how people have been
recommending dubious place to meet they
are on my wish list it's definitely
something that I want to get I really do
want to try this brand so I am going to
pass over this palette I really really
do want to try Julia's place but I have
a lot of eyeshadow palettes that I want
to purchase last week I was talking
about the Jacqueline health morphe
palette I was also talking about the
Urban Decay palette have some new
eyeshadow palettes that I haven't even
yet been able to try out yet because
there's only 24 hours in a day and I
usually only wear one makeup look per
day so I just know that at this time I
don't need it I would love to
get it honestly there's a few other
dubious place talismans and Nubian or
The Masquerade that I would love to try
even more like I kind of got my
attention even more than this
Zulu palette separates the Zulu pellet
but it is very eye-catching if you love
bright colorful shades like this looks
gorgeous
17:50 I do not think it's a bad price I
think there's usually discount codes
it's floating around as well for at
least I think it's 10% off so I mean yes
it looks very gorgeous but it's simply
something that I know that I don't need
right now even though it's more
affordable I just know that there's
other eyeshadow palettes I'm going to be
purchasing looks really beautiful for
sure but it also really didn't make me
do a double-take I think because I'm not
a super vibrant eyeshadow person like
yes it's super fun to have those shades
in my collection and very much more like
the brown neutral girl so it just didn't
immediately make me do a double-take and
like I said some of the other dubious
placed palettes have so I would rather
get them than this one if that makes
sense but I'd love to know as always in
the comments down below are you getting
this palette did you already get this
palette like who else just a love
dubious place because I know a lot of
you do and which one is your favorite
palette let us know in the comments down
below oh my oh my my oh my Instagram my
snapchat my everything kind of went
crazy when this launched it got
announced this is from a colour-pop
cosmetics seller pop came out with two
new recent releases the yes we are
shallow palette for $16 to give you more
highlighter palette for $18 so this
information I am getting opted trend
mood one Instagram so I'll have her page
to list it down below I typically do
list her page because a lot of times I'm
reading from her Instagram which I find
very helpful so she is listed in my
description box so the eyeshadow palette
was really the only one that I was
really getting tagged on I didn't really
get a lot of questions about the
highlighter palette so I'm just going to
talk about the eyeshadow palette in here
right now so the yes please i shadow
pellet which is $16 it has one two three
four eight nine ten eleven twelve twelve
shades contains two existing shades full
zip notes self at $16 it's limited
edition so this one it did become
available actually the day that I am
sitting down to film this video which is
Friday the 16th that came available at
10:00 PST
I actually missed the release completely
about driving areas live in my life and
I miss it and it sold out like super
super fast but to be honest that was
fine for me because I wasn't planning on
getting this mostly for the same reasons
that I just mentioned I just don't need
another eyeshadow palette right now I
really don't I am saying no to the color
pop yes please it looks so beautiful
dolt please do not get me wrong this
looks beautiful I did a double-take
I had to think about it it's only 16
dollars these are the pressed eyeshadows
from colour-pop which I love are some of
my favorites but I was able to talk
myself out of it I really was you know I
thought I still want to get the Declan
hell in urban decay you saw me in last
week's video if you caught it I was like
waffling back and forth like I just I
didn't know what to do do I bible $38
$64 what do I do
did decide that I want to pick up both a
lot of you guys really wanted to see my
reviews on it and I I just appreciate
that people listen to my reviews and
respect them that means a lot to me and
when I saw so many comments coming in
about please review full you know I want
to know if I should spend my money on it
those comments mean a lot to me and so I
thought you just you just need to do it
not like I'm like I'm just doing it for
you guys
I want the palette do you know to say
but reading those comments really was
like okay Smith oh like you got to do it
know that I don't need other eyeshadow
palettes right now and even though this
one was so futile clients only $16 I'm
like I feel like I already talked myself
into the other pellets so it was easier
to talk myself out of it and then
honestly I heard the film which was
super crazy by the time I finally got
back into my office and I left on my
snapchat people are like I can't believe
how fast that sold out they were super
frustrated about it I totally get it
those makeup launches can be so so
frustrating I tried with the color pop
and I love Sarah II collection and
couldn't get it and it was super
frustrating and I got upset about it I
might still be holding a slight grudge
over that one as well so might have been
another reason why I could easily talk
myself out of it but I did see on the
colour-pop snapchat they said that they
are going to bring it back even though
it's limited edition that they are going
to do another
Riis event so you should still be able
to get it in the future if I have a date
by the time this video goes live and
leave it in the comments down below but
colour-pop did Simon or snapchat will be
coming back but I still think even then
I'm just I'm not going to get it because
I just know that I don't need it you
guys if you watch my vlogs you're seeing
me try to organize my office and
organize my makeup collection it's
completely overwhelming to me so like
why add even more stress why I'd even
more stress because it's not what I'm
good at cell I know I don't need it it
looks beautiful is affordable I highly
recommend the color pop eyeshadows I
think they are fantastic I do not think
this would be a bad Buy at all I just
know that for me specifically I just
don't need it so I'm saying no to the
color pop a yes please palette but let
us know did you get it on launch date or
will you get it during the restock oh I
don't know oh my oh my I mean these the
last two that I'm going to talk about
just this week's live right like I
thought last week's vilify I was going
to break my will I buy it and this week
so I buy it I got so many requests on
all four items that I'm going to mention
usually it's like the last one or two
like really I got a ton of requests and
messages in about but all four it was
crazy
I'm sorry dig in here areas in the
parking in the background you guys know
Kim kardashian-west is coming out with
her own Beauty lighten kk w beauty is
going to be launching on June 21st today
as this video goes live so there's that
oh I don't even really know what I think
about this other than that's very
interesting
uh-huh I don't know you guys I don't
like to be negative but I don't know
here we go
so there is a Instagram page for k'kaw
beauty this is what is posted right now
from what I see she's going to be
launching with a cream contour and
highlight kit so I'll insert some photos
on here from Instagram page says each
kit comes with a dual ended contour
stick and dual ended highlighter one
matte one shimmer highlight and a dual
ended blending brush and sponge coming
621 - KK wud calm
I will have that information in the
description box as Owen
so no prices on it yet I haven't seen
any any any prices but we know what is
coming in the kit so that's good I'm not
going to be buying this um I don't even
know what I really think but when I saw
it I just kind of went what to me the
makeup and beauty thing is like Kylie's
Bay but I can't worry jumping on that
bandwagon there's so many things that
Kim kardashian-west could do there are
so many things and opportunities that
she could be doing and you're going to
start a makeup line like your sister I'm
like really like why it's just weird to
me because I feel like all the
kardashian-jenner sisters like they each
kind of have their own thing and their
own like vibe and to me like Kylie's was
makeup and beauties and now Kim has to
go ahead and do it and I have a lot of
negative thoughts on this clearly but
I'm just I'm not interested in buying it
I'm not understanding from it I'll talk
about Kylie cosmetics next but with
Kylie cosmetics I've been so unimpressed
lately I'm unimpressed with customer
service with shipping time with a lot of
the products that are going out I just
hear really not great things about them
and to me it's like can install ago
Kylie can just put out sell our products
but people are still going to find them
because of the name and now what did
Kylie Jenner make last year like forty
five million dollars or something and
most of that is because of her cosmetics
I'm like that's disgusting to me and I
just don't really want to be a part of
that I don't want to buy into it I know
people have a lot of feelings about the
Kardashians and the Jenners and I know
people are big fans of them but this
move by kim kardashian was just really
gave me very very bad vibe last time i
made a purchase from my entirely
cosmetics lust for the Kim
kardashian-west lipsticks and I do like
them I like the colors
I like this are not a liquid lipstick I
like that they're not a gloss like
they're kind of like a hybrid in between
the liquid lip creme and I like them
just fine but the shipping was very bad
the customer service when I was trying
to
the shipping was very bad and for people
who have as much money and as much
resources as they do for them now to
utilize them and to have their launches
go the way that they do and to treat the
customers the way that they do I just
can't be a part of that anymore
one person and I'm sure it's not a big
deal that I'm not making purchases but I
really do feel better about myself and
I'm not helping these people just make
an obscene amount of money so all they
can do is show us on social media how
much money they have and how many things
they have and all of their wealth and
cars and clothes and stuff like that
like it literally kind of makes me ill
sometimes when I see their snapchats
with their social media so I don't want
to help the cause basically is what I'm
trying to say and like I said I'm just
one person and I know that Kimmel or
Kylie is not going to care at all that
I'm saying that I'm not going to
purchase from them but it just has to be
like a personal thing with me that I'm
not going to do it and I'm not going to
support it so those are kind of my
feelings about the Kim kardashian-west
beauty I was being asked a lot of
questions about it and I just have like
really nothing good to say about it in
lowly talks about how she doesn't even
do her own makeup and she has all these
makeup artists and I was she's launching
a makeup line and I'm just like now
please like now I'm not usually a
negative person I don't like being
negative I feel like I'm talking really
fast and my chest is getting red because
I'm uncomfortable but it just really
turns me off just completely no I love
cream contour and I love highlighting I
have zero interest in purchasing that I
have no idea what the price is going to
be I'm assuming something exorbitant but
maybe it'll be affordable but I don't
know because I don't know the price yet
but like I said it's going to be
launching today 621 so I'll have any
links that I can in the description box
down below but I would love to know your
thoughts a lot of people love the
Kardashians and love Kim and love Kylie
so I know a lot a lot of people are
going to be buying this and that is
super great for you but just for me
personally like I got to make a stand
I'm just not interested in kids I Kim
kardashian-west baby I'm just not just
not interested not impressed we know
your thoughts down below so of course
the last thing that I'm talking about is
going to be Kylie cosmetics so Kylie
cosmetics is coming out with her new
launches at the summer collection I
believe it is number two
17 collection includes the skinny-dip
face duo bronzer and highlight 3 $4 the
wet set palette with four glowing
pressed powder
$62 the send me more nude lips set of
matte liquid lipsticks and a velvet
liquid lipsticks I think you can choose
if you want matter velvet with what I
was reading $45 each then we have two
super glitter glosses for $15 each then
we have the take me on vacation our
shadow palette for $62
then we have a lip kit with a liquid
lipstick in a little liner for $30 and
we have an ultra glow loop's
highlighters which are $14 each or you
can buy the bundle which includes
everything but the wet set for 250
dollars feel like I should just keep
this short and sweet because I feel like
I just gave a lot of my opinions in the
kardashian-jenner as I've talked about
am I just talking about Kylie not that
long ago what she'd come out with new
velvet new velvet lips or something
either it was in anta hall or will I buy
it I don't remember but no I'm not
purchasing anything from this like yes
didn't make me do a double-take and I
was like move especially about that wet
set sure and then I see the prices and I
just wanted to throw up like oh the wet
set palette for highlighters for $62 the
eyeshadow palette $52 and her prices
they're just going to keep because
people just keep buying them so I'm like
no I can't do it like the whole shipping
thing with the Kim kardashian-west made
me so mad that they didn't even ship out
the original orders before they did a
relaunch of it it just makes me think
they're just about money and I know when
I said that in past videos people are
like well of course they are and I'm
like you know I don't know them
personally so I'm not trying to sit up
here and like make accusations but when
a company does that the blew my mind
just like disgusting to me I'm just
getting upset all over again but no I
just I can't and I also thought it was
just last night I was watching some
Galvan YouTube who got PR from it and
honestly is like some things looks great
and some things didn't look great and
again from Carly she changes our formula
all the time we never know we're
expecting from her the eyeshadow palette
like absolute crap for $52 there's no
what like I just know I just don't have
any interest in it I tried to be on the
Kylie cosmetics chain for a while I do
have a look what lipstick from her that
I absolutely love like I said I like
those
look what lip crumbs just fine but
there's just so many other brands and
women and entrepreneurs that are out
there working their asses off and
hustling every single day edge to create
these new brands and I want to support
them I just have no interest in it like
I'm not going to sit up here and lie and
say nothing made me do a double take
because it certainly did like a set of
news liquid lipsticks that always calls
my name always I don't even care what
brand it is it's always going to make me
do a double take when you're going to
throw four liquid lipsticks at me the
eyeshadow palette did the wet side did I
think those are about the only ones that
I actually got interested in but just no
I just I just don't want to just given
me bad vibes to be honest I'll just have
our opinions and we all get to choose
what we put our money towards on our
makeup purchases if you're going to buy
everything in the Kylie cosmetics said
if you're going to buy everything Kim
kardashian-west puts out fantastic I'm
never going to judge you for that and
you should never judge what other people
are going to spend their money on and
what they believe in I just want to say
that you know cubicle in the comments
we're all going to have different
opinions and those are just mine on the
latest Kylie cosmetics launch so I have
no interest in this one I think it
already launched before I even filmed
this yeah I think it launched on the
15th which was the day before I'm
filming this I didn't even go to the
website I did nothing I think things
sold out in like 40 seconds or something
like that like that's ridiculous let us
know and the comments down below
leave me your opinions did you get
anything from the set are you super
excited about it or are you going to try
a bit restock just let us know in the
