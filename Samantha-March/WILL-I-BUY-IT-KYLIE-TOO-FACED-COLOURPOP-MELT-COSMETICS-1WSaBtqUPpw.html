so today's video is going to be a new
will I buy it at 12 smile la videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and also whether I'm going to
pick them up or if I'm planning to pass
over them like I said I do post these
every single Wednesday so I'll have my
playlist linked down below if you want
to catch any of my past will i buy
videos in addition to these I'm also
posting every single day
in addition it to a live chat on
Tuesdays at 4 o'clock CST if you would
ever like to join me there so if you do
like to get daily content of makeup and
beauty I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button but I have
so much to talk about this week so why
don't we go ahead and get started first
up I want to talk about a new release
from melt cosmetics since and so a lot
of people are really excited about the
melt hotbox so this is going to be a
collection it includes the haystack
which is $48 which is 4 different
eyeshadows also have a bunch of
lipsticks lip liners more lip liners
eyeliners couple eyeliners for eyeliners
5 eyeliners there's a lot of eyeliners
and lip liners in there
looks like the lipsticks are $19 liners
or $17 eyeliners $17 there's a makeup
bag for ten dollars and three different
colors or you can buy the bundle of
everything for $200 it's going to be
available on July 31st at noon PST on it
the melt website so I'll have a photo of
the whole collection in here I am
reading from the trend mood one
Instagram page so for page will be
linked down below so this is a very
large collection ah but I am going to
say that I'm going to pass over it I am
buying a ton of makeup right now like
there is so many new makeup releases
happening right now and so many things
that are really exciting me if you watch
last week's will I buy a video so many
people were like you are planning to buy
almost everything mentioned this week
and I'm like I know it is a serious
problem just like this the four order
last night so I'm going to pass over it
because I didn't really do the double
take I've never bought from milk
cosmetics I've always wanted to I've
always wanted to get one of their stacks
but I don't know I feel like the hay
stack it looks nice it looks good I like
the colors in it but I honestly I think
I would rather get their rough stack and
just like lipsticks and lip liners and I
went here some things like that I just I
just don't need at this time I don't
need any more makeup
but have a ton of them but really the
reason why I'm not buying this
collection is just because there's so
many other things out right now that I
want to buy and I want to be putting my
money towards so that's why I'm going to
pass over this milk collection election
though I like the color vibes that are
going on especially in the eyeshadow
stack that's definitely the thing that
drew my attention the most was the
eyeshadow stack but $48 for four
eyeshadows I know that they are really
big and you're getting a lot of product
but still $48 for four eyeshadows that
is a lot of money and I'm about to buy
my August subculture eyeshadow palette
so I just don't feel like I need these
but if you guys are huge fans of melt
cosmetics and you would recommend
something let us know or if you're
picking up anything from this collection
let us know what you have your eye on so
color pops came out with a few new
releases because of course they did they
came out with concealers and also
brushes so they have a variety of
different brushes and their soft
synthetic fiber brushes powder brushes
blush brushes I mean they have a bunch
of brushes for a variety of different
prices they also have the brushes bundle
which is $50 and a brush bundle plus the
brush roll which is $55 and then they
also have a bunch of concealers there's
15 different shades and they're going to
be $6 each I know they also came out
with highlighters and bronzer so people
are most specifically asking me about
the concealers and the brushes so right
off the bat I'm going to say no to the
brushes for sure I just have a ton of
makeup brushes I'm like a makeup brush
junkie I find makeup brushes all the
time like I need to actually declutter
my brush collection before I can think
about buying more brushes and for some
reason when I think of colour-pop
brushes I just like don't get excited
I mean I think it's cool the color
palette is expanding their line and
they're doing more they were kind of
with our super shock eye shadows for a
really long time the seriousness of
Brean is so freaking overwhelming like
it's just so fast so many collections so
many new releases it honestly always has
like in the back of my mind I'm like is
this really good quality if they're
coming out so fast like I just don't
know and some of those things from
colour-pop I'm not like super impressed
of us I talked about them and the makeup
I've changed my mind about video and
about like they're ultra matte look
six I don't know brushes just don't
really do anything for me concealers
though concealers I do love concealers I
that's one thing that like I really
don't want the house with is that my
concealer what I'm kind of seeing
because I know some influencers receive
this in PR so I've been watching the
snapchats and such what I've been seeing
is that it's a pretty like solid medium
coverage concealer which isn't bad for
me I really have become obsessed with
the shape table and wearing it right now
which is more full coverage but medium
coverage doesn't scare me I don't feel
like I need full coverage every single
day so when I hear medium coverage for a
concealer I think that that's fine they
have the 15 different shades so I feel
like I would be able to find a shade
just fine now I will say that I was
planning on purchasing the concealer I
was going to buy the yes police palette
when I came back in stock and I was
going to pick up a concealer as well and
then I missed the release my computer my
laptop died the day that it came back in
stock I got like I don't know weird
message it shut down it kicked me out
was very stressful and wonderful friend
Matt whose NIT ended up remoting into my
laptop all day and working on it and
trying to figure out the problem so I
don't even have control of my laptop and
to be honest the very last thing on my
mind during this time was buying new
makeup because I didn't know if I needed
to buy a new laptop so I missed the
release by the time we got done working
on my computer I remember like I went
back on Instagram thought I was like oh
shoot I bet it sold out I went to the
colour-pop website obviously it was out
of stock I'm like you know what we're
just not meant to be together there's
been to restock when I was on the road
the whole time the other my laptops died
and I just I just couldn't do it so I
don't think the me and I yes please pal
are meant to be together but I really
don't want to defy one concealer from
colour-pop it seems kind of silly to buy
a six dollar product and pay like I
don't all five or six dollars in
shipping just for one concealer it just
seems a little silly to me but to be
honest I was going to buy a concealer if
I could have bundled it with something
else to hit like their $30 free shipping
or just not pay shipping for one tiny
concealer I don't need a new concealer I
don't need it I have plenty of
concealers I was still going to buy it
because I was curious I wanted to try it
and I really do like concealers but I'm
just not
by one concealer from colour-pop I don't
want it that much that I'm just going to
buy one product from colour-pop and
there's just really nothing else from
colour-pop right now that I have my eye
on that I would want to get so that's
why I decided to pass over the
concealers in case you guys are
wondering but I have cleaned up
purchasing it it just doesn't call out
my name enough to just buy the one but I
would love to know if you guys got them
or tried them out or if you decided to
pick up the brushes again the brush is
just I don't know I just have no
interest in buying color palette brushes
I just kind of a brush knob so I don't
know there's that but if you guys tried
the color pop brushes and you think
they're amazing let me know because you
know I like brushes so but there's that
for the color pop I know I got so many
requests and talked about a color pop
again I know I talked about them and
somebody will i buy it videos but this
brand just releases like crazy but those
are my thoughts on the color pop of
brushes and concealers like to say that
the only reason I'm talking about this
next product is because so many people
have asked me across almost social media
channels and I felt like I had to
include it in a well hit by it video but
I'm going to try not to laugh the entire
time that we are talking about this
product because it is the Too Faced
white chocolate bar I shadow palette so
there's that so this is actually going
to be a part of the Too Faced holiday
2017 collection so you know drop it in
July I don't know maybe Christmas
centralize why they're doing I don't
know I don't know why Tuesday's talks
about their products so far in advance I
don't know I think it's a trend mid says
mid to end September release so there we
go but the white chocolate bar palette
no no I'm not buying this I feel like I
could just wrap it up here if you guys
have been following my channel for a
while but in case you guys are new here
maybe you don't know my opinion on to
face or the white chocolate chip palette
that came out but I shouldn't I hate it
that palette is what made me put my
relationship with Too Faced on hold we
are on a break right now we are in a
complicated relationship I'm not
answering to face calls probably because
to face isn't calling me but if they
were I wasn't going to be answering
because that pella just made me feel
things in a very bad
it's been pretty unimpressed with
two-faced for a while but I kept trying
to give him a chance because they are
one of my favorite like first favorite
high-end brands first favorite high-end
brands I started purchasing from selves
like no come on to face like we can keep
it together I bought the white chocolate
chip palette and I was like oh god I
give up some of their releases the
majority of their releases and choose
not going well they're just not going
well on a pole and I'm not trying to say
if you like the white chocolate chip
palette that you're wrong or whatever
because that's totally not the case it
just wasn't for me I actually touched on
this palette in my eating and yang
review video that I did in collaboration
with live loves from makeup you can
check it out where we talk all about you
know just because someone likes one
thing and you don't doesn't mean you're
wrong or you can't respect opinions and
things like that and we touched on the
white chocolate chip palette because she
actually liked it and I just like
despise it which is kind of funny but
you know that pellet did not give me
good vibes so now that they're coming
out with a larger one I'm like no no I'm
not doing it
it looks a little strange I'm not it
looks a little strange there's like a
mint green almost looking oh yeah it's
called mint chocolate so yeah so that'd
be a mint green okay and then they have
like a lavender shade in there as well
lavender cake I'm okay
I just sum up these shades in here I
don't quite get a hundred percent you
know I see some of the shades in here
that were in the small palette as well
which obviously not make sense but some
of these other ones I don't know it's
just not very like it's just not very
cohesive and when I think of like the
white chocolate bar palette I guess some
of these shades I don't see belonging in
there I feel like they could be in a
different palette that's two-faced could
two remotes but I don't know what do I
know but another thing I will say about
the Too Faced Holiday Collection is a
lot of people don't have good things to
say about those releases and man I don't
know because a lot of people really like
to chocolate bar palette I actually got
sent a chocolate bonbon palette from a
subscriber and I liked it just fine I
thought it was really good I enjoyed the
shades out of it so I know that those
are like really loved palettes but a lot
of lights are special releases or their
holiday releases like the quality's just
not there and
kind of seems like the quality of
toothpaste anyways kind of going
downhill lately so I'm not going to do
it I'm assuming this palate it's going
to be in the $40 range which is where I
think the other chocolate our palates
are maybe like $49 or something like
that
so I'm not going to spend my money on
that when I feel like we just won't get
along I'll be excited to watch some
reviews you know maybe this won't be a
bad palette so I'll just wait for the
reviews to come in but I'm not going to
get the palette I'm not going to be
reviewing it I really have no interest
in this one but I wanted to touch on it
because so many people asked me I felt
like I had to include it in a will I buy
a video so there you go my thoughts on
the Too Faced white chocolate bar
palette and next up this was my most
requested to talk about it was really
close between the two phase and then the
Kylie birthday collection my a Jenner is
coming out with a new collection with
Kylie cosmetics and it's about her
birthday because she's turning 20 which
is us very different let's just start
with that so her birthday collection and
includes new ultra glows new liquid
lipsticks some of them are right Chloe
okay the birthday book which is a face
palette includes eyeshadows blushes
highlighters and there's glosses there's
more matte lipsticks a makeup bag a
brush set
it's all very like pink and glittery and
sparkly I don't see praises right now
usually Kylie doesn't release the prices
until like right before the collection
launches which it launches August 1st at
3 p.m. PST so when I have the prices I
can put them in the description box down
below since I am pre solving so far in
advance because it's going out of town
but the Kylie collection okay so I'm not
going to be purchasing anything up from
the Kylie collection I know I've had a
couple comments in the past I'm like my
aunty hauls or will i buy videos where i
talk about certain brands such as to
facing trial and cosmetics and i
repeatedly say that i'm not going to be
purchasing from them and some people are
saying why do you even include it in
your videos then we already know but
that's not necessarily the case because
if you are new is this is my very first
video of mine that you are watching how
would you know my
on Kylie and toothpaste you know what
I'm saying so even though I love and
appreciate all the people who have been
watching me for a very long time there's
also a lot of very new faces to my
channel who might not know my past who
might not have watched past will I buy
our anti hell videos like I said - I put
in these videos the most requested
products to talk about so I'm not just
randomly exciting what I want to talk
about ice cream chat I keep a list
Italian up every single week what people
want to see and then when I put it in my
will advice videos I put it in the order
as well starting from the least
requested to the most requested that
week that is how I do it so that is why
you might think you know why is she
talking about this again we already know
that she doesn't like Kylie Jenner
well you might know what the next person
watching might not know so hopefully
that makes sense but my views on Kylie
Jenner is that at this time I'm just not
interested in supporting like I said in
the past there's just so many other
brands new brands indie brands women
entrepreneurs that are coming out that I
would just rather support / Kylie Jenner
I have had bad customer service
experiences in the past with Kylie and
I'm just not super interested in this
time at purchasing from her like I say
as well I'm not saying that I'm never
going to produce some Kylie cosmetics or
I'm never going to purchase anything
that Kylie Jenner comes out with because
I don't know that I can't see into the
future something might change my mind
but at this time it's just not what I'm
interested in especially just with salt
like as of right now of the time that
I'm filming there's so much new makeup
coming out that I would rather put my
money towards then this like glittery
valentine looking collection that does
nothing for me like this collection
doesn't have a look at it and I'm just
like 20 okay so alright and I'm not
trying to sound rude I'm dad drama
Channel I'm not someone who analyzes
talk ish about a lot of other people but
the collections of packaging everything
it just it does nothing for me so that's
kind of my thoughts onto Kylie Jenner
that's why I don't want to purchase and
you know support her brand at this time
but also I've tried to items from her in
the past it is always so different like
I mean I feel like she can't find a
formula and stick with it every time I
was made a purchase from her especially
with her liquid lipsticks it's a
different formula and
don't know what I'm getting so that's
super frustrating for me if you don't
like something you can't return it I
mean heck if you place an order and two
weeks later it hasn't shipped and you
try to ask customer service they
basically just brush you off because
they don't care you already gave her
your money she doesn't care that is
truly how I feel when it comes to Kylie
Jenner and her brand she don't care what
the Kim kardashian-west the lipstick
lunch that they did together
I bought that because I'm a noob
lipstick lover and I was like you know
what I'm going to go ahead and give this
a try it didn't shift for like ten days
or something like that I tried to email
customer service they basically said
like f off we don't care but it looks
crazy to me but they did a launch on
Tuesday not one item had shipped from
that launch and they relaunched they
restocked on Friday and letting more
people buy it without launching without
shipping original orders that is bad
business and I'm not interested and once
that happened I'm like you know I'm not
interested that was kind of like my
final straw when it came to Kylie
cosmetics I was like you know what I try
to not be too irritated in the beginning
like I understand a new brand even
though you're Kylie Jenner and you have
literally everything at your disposal to
make your business go swimmingly unlike
just give it a chance new business new
brand obviously she's just turning 20 so
for her to have an entire cosmetics line
making millions every single launch is
crazy but I thought just give it time
it'll get better and to me it's not
getting better it's just not getting
better so I'm not gonna be purchasing
anything from the kindly Berthoud
collection I know a lot of your Kylie
Jenner fans and fans of Kylie cosmetics
so let me know in the comments down
below what you're most interested from
in this collection because like I always
say on the wilayat videos you have to do
you you could just spend your money on
what you want to spend your money on and
I don't have to spend my money on stuff
that I don't want to spend my money on
so lesson or thoughts on the Kylie
cosmetics and birthday lunch in the
comments down below but after that it's
going to do it for this week's abilify
