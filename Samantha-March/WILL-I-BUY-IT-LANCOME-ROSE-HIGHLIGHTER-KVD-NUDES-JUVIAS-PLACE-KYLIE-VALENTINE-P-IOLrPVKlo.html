so today's video is going to be a will i
buy it video i post my way my advice
videos every single Wednesday where I
talk about usually do makeup releases
and if I'm going to purchase them why
not what I'm going to send my money on
what to think about these new releases
that sort of thing I do like I said with
my will advise every single Wednesday
this is my will I by Wednesday series
and I do have a playlist with all of my
past videos as well so I will leave that
link down below in case you are curious
to check out the other videos I also do
post four times a week so i plunked on
wednesdays thursdays and then also
sundays and mondays but hope is you guys
will hit the subscribe button if you
would like to get notified when I post
my video but as always with my will
invite videos I have a lot to talk about
i also am struggling with a very sore
throat and it hurts to talk so why don't
we go ahead and just hop right into it
okay so this one is getting a lot of
buzz and i've been getting a lot of tags
and it is the lancome love rose powder
highlighter so this one is just it's a
product that makes you do a double take
like when i first saw it coming out and
people are talking about it i was like
what is that like it just looks crazy
beautiful the packaging is just so
completely on point and I'm looking at
the Macy's website right now under
product details so it says get the
latest on trend glow look through the
most elegant and vintage methodology and
calculated in a 1950s french-inspired be
shoebox traditionally mental health
loose powders is a new generation of
highlighting luminous powder the powder
is evenly dispersed among rose petals
inside of the box and how to use it so
don't we throw the kabuki brush so
liberally in a circular motion around
the rose petals to pick up the perfect
amount of formula for perfect even glow
so it's sixty dollars for a highlighter
so I mean I like I'm sure you guys are
like what is she going to say she gonna
buy that or she's not gonna buy that
I'm going to pass over it because of the
price tag it's sixty dollars for a
highlighter I get it it is cool it is
visually so super appealing I I
understand I understand why people are
buying it I'm not going to judge you if
you buy it I'm going to judge but I'm
not gonna buy it for myself even though
I think it looks cool I think it's super
innovative I love like the hatbox style
that it comes in I just all of it is
amazing packaging everything everything
about this is so cool but I'm not going
to spend sixty dollars on the highlight
I'm not going to do that to myself and
I'm not going to that to my bank account
and honestly like I see her spot chest
and it looks pretty but let's like the
actual highlight product also isn't like
blowing me away I feel like I have other
highlighters that I would like just as
much if not more than this highlight so
for the actual product I don't think
that I needed pass over this one a
simple because of the price simple it's
just too expensive for me for highlights
I also say that I'm going to spend a lot
of money on products I try to spend that
money on products that I'm going to use
it on a daily basis or get a lot of use
out of and a highlight isn't that for me
I'm not wearing any highlight today I
went for like a very matte look mad eyes
Matt face matte lips I don't wear
highlight every single day so it just
wouldn't be a smart purchase for me do I
like it yes I do I think it looks
beautiful i was about to have it like
sitting on my desk like I always have
this beautiful rose sitting on my desk
next my computer i love it i think it's
so cool i also am hearing like i've been
reading some articles and seeing what
people are saying about it and they say
that the rose shape like will not lose
its shape or form like as you use it
it's not going to like do anything to
the actual rose pattern that's always
going to stick around I think that's
very cool like even after you've used to
highlight if you definitely be like a
decorative piece for sure like I want to
throw that away if I got through if I
somehow got through all of the highlight
in there and then I just have this
beautiful rose like for sure i'm not
going to throw that away like i'm going
to use it as decor somewhere in my house
but well I think it's super beautiful
and very cool and very
creaking I'm just not going to spend the
money on it but I would love to hear you
guys with thoughts have any of you guys
gotten it i'll leave it at link down
below at any of the vendors that i can
find it out but let us know if you've
gotten it or if you plan on picking this
one up so i was getting quite a few
questions on the new kat von d nude
lipstick so a kat von d beauty has
released one two three six six six new
liquid lipsticks and they are all news
so i see they are part of the
everlasting liquid lipsticks I do have
bow and arrow which I consider to be
like a brown nude and I absolutely love
it so the six new new colors they are
available on sephora.com right now and
it says that they will also be sold as a
bundle in February and from reading a
couple things online there is possibly
like a discount for buying all six in
the bundle there might be like a price
discount so that I think that's
interesting and I believed illicit
lipsticks are twenty dollars like the
rest of her everlasting love with
lipsticks are all twenty dollars I'll
put the photos in here at the swatch
photos that we have of it but reading
from this is a from hello giggles calm
there's crucifix which is a deep
chocolate Ophelia a new testament
Hawkwind a new Sienna Ludwig a nude fawn
sanctuary a cool sepia and unisa a nude
pedal really um I don't know what those
names are and I don't know if there's
something something behind those names
but those are interesting so I'm looking
at the swatches that unisa is the
lightest one it looks to be probably too
light for my skin tone but Ophelia and a
Ludwig look to be like like I'm eyeing
those ones even sanctuary looks really
pretty that probably wouldn't really be
a nude on me and Hawkwind I like that as
well crucifix would probably be too dark
for me that looks like almost like it'd
be like chocolate on my list but i would
say there's three two four six shades in
here that really catch my attention i
might wait and see what the
they will cost us and then maybe if the
bundle is a decent price i could buy the
bundle and then just give away the ones
that i don't think that i would wear but
if i had to choose one i think i would
pick Ludwig I don't know would be
between Ludwig and Ophelia but I would
like to purchase one of these liquid
lipstick I do have bow and arrow like I
said and it's one of my favorites I wear
that one all the time i'm a big fan of
that formula so i would definitely
purchase one of these nude ones i'm
going to try to wait to see identity at
the 10-minute filming they didn't have
the bundle price out yet i don't know if
that will come a little bit closer to
februari but thats in just a couple days
here so i'll probably wait and see if
there's some sort of like a really good
discount maybe i would do it but I can't
imagine I don't know i guess i can't
imagine it being like sad fantastic of a
discount but so at the time that i'm
filming they did launch just a few days
before i'm filming this video all of the
shades are still available on like the
support com website so i guess i'm not
super worried about them selling out
like i have to purchase them right away
what i'll do is probably add a couple to
my loveless on sephora and then the next
time i am placing a sephora order i will
purchase them in that order but yeah i'm
totally down to try a couple new kat von
d lipsticks and i think i'll add Ophelia
and ludwig to my loveless and then the
next time i check out at sephora i will
grab those unless ice years that the
bundle is going to be a really good
price and then i'll wait for the bundle
but yeah thank you guys for the tags i
think you guys know that i love
lipsticks I'm definitely a lipstick
junkies so I think I get typed the most
on lipsticks but I saw so many coming
through on the new Kat Von D news so i
thought i would throw that in there has
anyone else gotten at one of the new new
Chinese from kat von d or will you be
picking them up let us know in the
comments down below ok I was also
getting a ton of Ton Ton Ton of tags and
questions about if I was going to be
buying this one this one is from Julius
place and it is there at the haárin
palette this is a new palette to them
and it is twenty-eight dollars looking
on their website it says the sahara
palette was inspired by the vibrancy and
vivaciousness of the Fulani culture not
one hundred percent
that I'm saying that correctly but it
says there's 12 beautifully coordinated
colors with a combination of format
colors for transitioning shimmery and
satin finish okay I also think it's
interesting at the dubious place website
right now and it says available coupon
codes for ten percent off Nicki beauty
call Julius tread mood dupe that like
isn't just list them all right there
that's interesting I don't know if I
wasting that before but so you guys know
you can basically always be a ten
percent off your dubious place orders
definitely use coupons where you can my
like I said its twenty eight dollars so
you know add ten percent to that so let
me just zoom in I'll insert the photo
down here as well so I talked about
dubious place in a will i buy it video
maybe like a month or so back I was
getting a lot of questions about Julius
place and I'd never actually purchased
from them so I mentioned them in a video
and I talked about how I would really
like to purchase from them i'm very
curious about the brand I just haven't
purchased anything yet a lot of times
it's because when a brand is released
new to me I get kind of nervous and
hesitant you know you don't really know
what to expect you don't know what to
expect and customer service from
shipping from the actual product you
know you just don't really know being
said I'm looking at this one right now
and I'm very attracted to it I'm very
attracted to this palette and I don't
know if I can actually put my finger on
what it is that is doing it for me but
something is doing it for me there's
this beautiful like pink shade call i
think is called sulla it's like a
shimmery looks maybe like a pink
raspberry type of shades from looking at
just a photo on here not an actual
swatch it looks super beautiful just
these shimmer shades are so eye-catching
and then we have I like that there
appears to be like the one transition
shade in here which is always very
important you do need that transition
shade but there's these like pops of
oranges there's a nice black in there
like I don't think I would have expected
to see a black in there sometimes it
feels like palettes can kind of forget
the black that it's actually a nice
thing to have in a palette and then I
don't know I'm just very attracted to
this palette
first thought come out and I first saw
the photos of it it was just one of
those pallets that made me do a double
take and you know and I have fun in my
Willa diet videos that if a product
doesn't scream out to me right away I
don't try to convince myself to buy it
because there's other makeup products
obviously new releases are happening all
the time but there's other makeup
products that do catch my eye right away
that do make me take a double pink and
those are the products that i want to
buy so i actually think i'm going to get
this on you guys I think this is going
to be my first dubious place purchase
and I'm excited about it I talked about
him in my last alliance video there was
a lot of comments in there I've read and
respond to all the comments and there
was a lot of very good comments about
with the Nubian pallid and it being two
powers at masquerade palette there was
really good feedback on them so i think
i'm going to go for this one what do you
guys think have you guys gotten this or
will you get it would you want to see
like swash and review video on it let me
know what you think but I'm really
interested in it twelve shades $28 ten
percent discount don't forget that I'm
think I'm going to go for it I know I
say in a lot of my videos and an
eyeshadow palette jumpy and i truly and
not like that's like the biggest thing
that's holding me back that I'm like
doing in my childhood do any of no I
shadow palette but honestly I was going
to buy the royal peach palette from
Kylie a nice serious I just forgot about
the launch I was working out completely
forgot about it and missed out on it and
so like I kind of had prepared myself
that I was going to buy another
eyeshadow palette so I don't know for
some reason I'm not like feeling super
guilty when I'm saying like I'm gonna
buy another eyeshadow politics get this
one let me know what you guys think if
you already purchased it it is already
for sale so i'll leave it linked down
below let us know if you've got it what
you think a dubious place or if you'll
be picking up the hard palate from
dubiously hi guys and then the final
items that we're going to talk about
husband the most requested to talk about
this week i am of course talking about
the Kylie cosmetics valentines day
collection and launch this is a very big
collection I don't know if this is the
biggest collection launch like highly
cosmetics was done but in my mind I feel
like it is there is a lock I've been
trying to
the best article to read off of for this
section of the video and I'm going to be
reading off allure.com I did watch all
of Chi ladies snaps when she was showing
the collection and doing these swatches
so people are just wondering what it
isn't going to buy if anything from this
valentine's day collection so the minis
are going to be returning this time they
have metallic red accents it's a six
piece set to include three new shades
and three original shades so let's see
the shades are Mary Jill Posey k and
Malibu those are the shades that are
already available I do not have any of
them and then apricot high maintenance
and head over heels are new shades so
i'm not sure why would I haven't been
able to find prices on anything I've
been looking at you know Kylie's stuff
trend moods different websites I can't
find prices on anything so I'm not
really sure if that's like the hardest
part about doing this video's that
there's going to be no prices that
honestly you'll you'll understand when I
start talking about it why I decided to
include it this week but also because
it's launching this week I think the
launch is February's second which is
thursday linssen thursday i think it's
thursday of this week so i did want to
include it in here so the minis if i
remember last month i didn't feel like
hurt like the holiday minis I didn't
feel like they were a bad price I
remember thinking like oh that's
actually kind of affordable I would
purchase that honestly out of everything
in the Valentine's collection I would
purchase the lip minis because i feel
like i would get the most out of them i
love lipstick i'm a lipstick junkie like
I don't wear highlight in every single
video but I will wear lipstick in every
single video I'm actually wearing on
Kyle a lipstick right now I did not plan
that this is exposed from a Kylie
cosmetic so I would purchase it I'm
going to double check and see what the
prices and then honestly like the
biggest hassle of buying from patty
cosmetics its actual launch itself it's
so crazy a lot of times you put in a
line a lot of times things are
disappearing from your cart sometimes
you get charged but you didn't actually
make the purchase like you didn't get it
in time but your card still got charged
like the launches are just kind of a
hassle so again this might just be like
the peach collection where if I'm around
and I remember the launch is happening
sure I'll pop in and get this set of
minions but I'm not going to put my life
on hold for a highly cosmetics release I
like her products but I don't feel the
need to drop everything just to buy from
cosmetics foot out of everything in the
collection the minis intrigued me the
most and are what i would buy the most
does that make sense if i decide to buy
it so that is the minis there is also
two new lip kits coming the shades are
in Valentine and head over heels Lucas
are $29 regularly so I assume that these
will be twenty nine dollars they come
with a liquid lipstick and the lip liner
I'm going to pass over these I'm not
drawn to lip liners I actually don't
prefer to purchase the lip kiss I was
really happy when she started coming out
with just the map singles because I just
don't really wear a lip liner it's just
not necessary for me so I'd rather
purchase a liquid lipstick on its own
for seventeen dollars versus the what I
say twenty nine dollars just to include
a lip liner so I'm going to pass over
those and we also have Kylie's diary
this looks to be like a very large
pallet it has I shadows in there and
then also blushes which is going to be a
first from Kylie cosmetics so that was
very interesting so this has nine I
shadows and the two blushes it also does
have a mirror again I can't find a price
on this one her peach how it was $45 but
i don't think i would be getting this
one pretty it looks nice I just don't
feel like I need it and like I said at
the saharan pilot from dubious place
caught my attention and more than this
one did help I may be purchasing any eye
shadows in the near future I'm going to
purchase the one that screamed out to me
the most and I just have a feeling that
the Sahara collett at twenty-eight
dollars will probably be cheaper than
the Kylie one so I'm going to pass over
that but let me know what you guys think
because I feel like this one is going to
be like the really hot ticket because it
includes the blushes which has never
been seen before so i think that people
are going to get really excited for that
but it just doesn't do enough for me
right now especially what's wanting to
purchase a different palette and then
there's also two Valentine's boxes with
two pre-exists
doing lip products and a mini to shadow
palette inside so the shadows are
exclusive to the collection so there's
the kiss me smooth and sweetheart
collection so the kiss me collection has
dirty peach and a pop and gloss as the
lip shade and then a map peach and
metallic light peach shadows I'm sorry
i'm not i'm not doing this these have
these I just don't care about at all to
be really honest with you guys I feel
like it's just another product to get
people to buy I just don't have any
interest in buying them I or II don't
know the prices but I already just feel
like I don't need them out of all of
them I like these colors the most like
the color schemes the pinks and the
peaches and like the gold pop a new
gloss I think it's pretty but I would
rather just purchase regular items I
don't know i don't know if that's just
me but I'm just like it's just
overwhelming like this collection is
seriously overwhelming as I'm filming it
it's like giving me anxiety of
everything that I have to talk about my
voice is like stop talking the
sweetheart mini collection includes a
mix of pinks and news for the lips
election they're still say k and
literally I own literally so immediately
I'm like nope I'm not going to buy this
and then the shadows is a salmon pink
and a shimmery champagne again I just
not gonna buy it and then the smooch
mini collection there's a deep red shade
included in the palette and a metallic
pale pink those are the eyeshadows the
tulip products from the cocoa collection
which is gorge and damn China damn Gina
damn tryna say and I'm joint I don't
know what that name is I'm not going to
purchase those the cocoa collection
really didn't do anything for me I
thought about purchasing it mostly just
because I like Chloe like if I had to
pick a Kardashian system to hang out
with all day is probably going to be
Chloe but the collection just didn't do
anything for me I didn't think the
shades were really my type of shade so
immediately I would toss over this
pellet I don't know I just said minions
just didn't they just didn't do it for
me guys I think that is everything in
the collection as I've gotten to the end
of the article also i think it is I
alert I can't even remember what I so
start it was to be honest with you
