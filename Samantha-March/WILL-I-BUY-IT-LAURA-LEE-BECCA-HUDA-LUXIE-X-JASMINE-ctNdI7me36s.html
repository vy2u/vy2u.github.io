today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my bill about videos
every single Wednesday I'm talking about
some new makeup releases and launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then giving some input on if I'm
planning on picking them up before
myself or not as always with my will
invite videos I have a time to chat
about this week so let's go ahead and
get started already so first up I have
some makeup brushes to talk about
I do love makeup brushes so this is a
collaboration between Luxy beauty and
Disney it is the Alexi Jasmine
collection as in Princess Jasmine as in
Aladdin as in my favorite Disney movie
my favorite Disney Princess is Jasmine
if you guys don't know now you know
so the Luxy Jasmine a brush set it has
six different brushes a stippling face
brush an angled brush a highlight brush
a blending brush a shader brush and an
angled eye brush it all comes in a
beautiful box with a mirror it is going
to be a $95 or there is an individual
brush that you can pick up which is the
large powder brush also comes in a box
that will be $40 I'm reading from the
trend one Instagram so her Instagram
page will be linked down below it says
it was available the weekend up Jen
Beauty which was last weekend June
Beauty in New York which was last
weekend it'll be available on the
website September 25th I have it linked
down below if it is still available
let's see it it's going to be a limited
edition so like I said Princess Jasmine
is my favorite Disney Princess if you
made me pick I would pick Jasmine I was
jasmine so many times for Halloween even
as an adult I don't care so in my first
novel that I wrote destined to fill the
main character's name is Jasmine because
I love Jasmine I love the movie Aladdin
so when I saw this I immediately went
like yay like I was so excited I got so
so pumped for it so I had that moment
you guys know I talked about doing the
double take did something make you
really excited to something make you do
that double take if it does then you got
to think about do you need this product
is it really worth it do you need in
your collection or gonna be sad if you
don't have it etc so clearly if I
clapped my hands like a little girl then
I was excited about it so then I started
asking myself do you really need that
and here is my dilemma ladies and
gentlemen I
just did a makeup brush to clutter like
within what the past month even though I
did a makeup brush to clutter I still
bought makeup brushes I still got some
makeup brushes sent to me as well in PR
so there was that but I was also buying
some and I'm looking at my makeup brush
collection right now and it's it's kind
of overflowing so I'm like do I need do
I need six brushes for $95 that's
expensive I mean really I kind of only
want the box like if anybody buys the
brushes but you don't want the box I'll
take it like just consider me your
recycling because I would take that box
it looks so beautiful but when I
actually sat down to think about it I
was like you don't need this I have all
of those verses that are in there I have
duplicates of many of the brushes that
are in there I do like Lexie Beauty and
I do like their brushes I own quite a
few of them I do think there are really
good quality brushes but I have seen
with the luck see Beauty collaborations
that they do especially some of like
their Disney ones I've done a Wonder
Woman pretty recently as well they are
pretty high priced I know when we talk
about doing collaborations with like
Disney and I talked about Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory last week someone
brought up a good point of you know what
probably cost a lot of money for those
brands like licensing wise and getting
you know approval to even do the
collaborations and have those characters
on there so I totally get it I
understand where the extra cost is
coming from but that doesn't mean that I
wanted to pay that extra cost because
ninety five dollars for six brushes I
mean that that really is quite a bit but
this that looks absolutely beautiful if
you are in the need for new brushes take
a look at this one if you're a Disney
fan or Jasmine fan or Aladdin fan like
me take a look at the brushes I do think
Lexi has really good quality brushes so
I don't think you're gonna pay ninety
five dollars and get really like cheap
nasty brushes that are gonna fall apart
on you I truly don't think that Ashley
because I just did that makeup brush to
clutter and I've really been trying to
do better I just can't say yes I'm gonna
go ahead and purchase this but it
definitely gave me a double take it got
me really excited about it I just had to
talk myself through it and I ended up
talking myself out of it but let me know
who's your favorite Disney Princess
what's your favorite Disney movie
because now we know that my nizzle
and Princess Jasmine and I would love to
know yours righty it seems though who to
beauty is coming out with a few new
releases I was recently getting tagged
on some of these so these are she's
coming out three new products without
the faux filter foundation which is full
coverage in 30 different shades it's
gonna be $40 we have the complexion of
perfection primer and then also the face
blending brush I'm looking at the trend
mood sight and she only has the prices
for the foundation I don't see the
prices available for the primer or the
brush yet and it says that these will be
available worldwide in October Huda
Beauty does have her own website of
course that you can purchase off of and
then she is also sold at Sephora as well
I'm pretty excited when I saw this I
don't I wouldn't say like I'm brand
loyal to who to beauty by any means I
haven't bought either of her eyeshadow
palettes I do like her lashes look what
lipsticks are truly some of my absolute
favorites so I like her but I'm not you
know super crazy every time she comes
out with something I like oh my gosh yes
I have to buy it she typically is a
little bit more expensive as well and
the foundation is $40 which I do think
that is pretty pricey for a foundation
being said did a double-take again on
this one I really like foundation I like
trying out new foundation I'm just
definitely on a foundation kick right
now I saw foundation I was like hmm
foundation you say don't think that I
would purchase the primer or the brush
again I just don't need any brushes
right now the primers I have so many
primers and I'm I'm pretty particular
about my primers actually so I don't
think I would need to get that one but
the foundation was one that I had to sit
and think about two things that are
holding me back from being like yes I
really want to purchase this foundation
one is the price because $40 is pretty
expensive it says it's full coverage and
I'm not a huge full coverage fan if you
watch my videos if you watch my channel
in the past you hear me say a lot that I
don't love full coverage I don't love
the way it looks on my skin I don't like
the finish it gives I'm just not a huge
fan in general I still would like to try
the foundation just because this is the
first foundation up from huda beauty I'm
very curious about it I do like her
brand I think if it comes into Sephora
and if I can like get maybe like double
cashback on ebay or if Sephora is having
like just the other weekend they had
like a pop-up sale all of a sudden for
15% off if they do something like that I
think I would purchase it or I'm not
sure when the next vib sale is coming
but that might be something that I would
put on my list there so just because
it's a little more pricey and I'm not
sure how I'd feel about the coverage I
don't want to pay full price right away
for it but if I can get some sort of
discount somewhere in there I think I
would go ahead and try this out I don't
think about this new release affirmative
beauty if you are excited to see her
expanding her brand once again let us
know what you think in the comments down
below and if you plan on picking up any
of these three new products the next
item I want to talk about is a new
release from Becca cosmetics this is the
après-ski Glo collection the eye lights
palette I'm probably saying that wrong
for sure but this is a limited edition
I believe Sephora exclusive palette it's
$45 it says it's a palette that features
at seven shades and two with two luxe
finishes a satin matte and a high shine
I'm not gonna lie I was very confused
when I saw this because I thought it was
a highlight palette but then looking on
the trend wood website it made comments
- it's an eyeshadow palette but then and
it's called the eye lights palette and
then I looked at the names and the names
in there I recognized as traditional
highlights for Abeka so I'm like what is
this so I'm reading off the Sephora app
it says put your eyes in the spotlight
with this limited edition eyeshadow
palette featuring it the best-selling
shimmering skin and Perfector hylander
formula customized specifically for the
eyes these exclusive parents allow you
to dial up or down the lights to create
a customized light effect for all skin
tones and eye colors so the shadows and
there are pearl rose quartz moonstone
opal topaz toasted marshmallow and hot
cocoa so I recognized opal because I
have that highlight also recognized
pearl and moonstone so that's why I was
like I was having a lot of confusion but
this is an eyeshadow palette you get the
two different finishes so definitely
right away the packaging caught my
attention I thought that packaging was
really beautiful finally it gave me the
double take once I kind of figured out
what it was I was like okay I showed a
palette because I am on a highlight no
bye so I was like
highlight palette probably shouldn't buy
that but then I saw a shadow palette and
I was like mm maybe we could delve into
this a little further so $45 for seven
shades Rebecca I feel like that's
actually a pretty good price point to be
honest Becca is high-end so they're
typically higher price so when I saw
seven shades I was like well that's not
so bad
but the shades are pretty smaller in the
pan and it's very interesting palette
wise because there's like a lot of
palette and then like these little pans
with the product in it so I don't know
if that part to me is a little bit
strange I do think that some of these
shadows would look so gorgeous on my
eyes I've dogged a lot like some of
these darker shades in here immediately
caught my attention and I mean I feel
like you could probably wear some of
these as highlights as well I mean I
have worn highlights as eyeshadows I'm
sure that you could wear the eyeshadows
as highlights I'm just I'm very
interested in it it definitely made me
did the double take it made me you know
when I was looking at on Instagram and I
was getting excited about it I had to go
over to the Sephora to see what exactly
it was and what it was all about I'd be
curious to try out the formula and see
what I think about it I usually am a
little bit leery of limited edition so I
didn't love that fact but the more I
kind of like sat and thought about it
the more I was kind of drawn to it I
just think it's really interesting and
unique
there's no matte shades in there so it's
not going to be an eye shadow palette
then you can get a full look out of you
know if you're someone who likes to go
in with your matte shadows which I am so
there's that so this might be something
that you reach for you know just for one
particular shade on one day or two
particular shades on one day something
like that but I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty
into this one to be honest I'm I
definitely want to put it on my list I
know people are talking about the VIP
sale quite a bit does anyone know when
that's happening because I feel like I'm
hearing a lot of chatter about it I'd
like to do it during a sale or like
Sephora just have this 15 percent off
sale a couple of weekends ago or just be
able to get at some sort of discount
because I don't think I'm going to reach
for it on a really consistent basis if
it's just you know you know going to
grab one shadow or two shadows and when
I
not gonna use something really
consistently like that I typically like
to try to get it at some sort of
discount just to try it you know that's
kind of like how I look at my shopping
what I am purchasing makeup so I think
that I want to do that but the only
other thing that's holding me back right
now is that I know Becca is coming out
with a holiday palette which the holiday
palette would be limited edition as well
only seem like a sneak peak teaser of
what it is it looks to be like some sort
of palette so I kind of almost want to
wait and see what that Becca holiday
release is and see which one maybe
interests me more hopefully by the time
I do my next holiday makeup releases
video we'll have all that information so
I can put that in the video and then
kind of put these two up against each
other and see which one I would rather
have make me not want to purchase it
right away because I would like to see
what this other Becca release is and
then also I am looking at the Becca
website and there is a comment that they
responded back to someone and they said
it would it will be available in alpha
beauty next week but on the Sephora app
it says it's exclusive to them so that
is kind of confusing to me but it sounds
like it might be available next week if
I have the exact date I can leave in the
description box down below but let me
know what you think in the comments down
below I'm going to be eyeing this one
out be putting it on my loves list and
I'll wait and see what happens with the
Becca holiday release but let me know in
the comments down below if this one made
you do the double take like it did me so
most definitely in the most requested
item that I got asked to talk about this
week is the cat's pajamas I showed up
Helen this is the first makeup product
in the new brand that was launched by
Laura Lee her brand is Laura Lee Los
Angeles Laura Lee is a youtuber he is
launching her own makeup brand which is
super exciting it's always really fun to
see kind of what youtubers decide to do
like kathleenlights
with kale polish and then you know
seeing Laura Lee come out with a makeup
brand that's really exciting and I
really I really do commend people who
can do that product is the eyeshadow
palettes called the cat's pajamas gonna
have ten different shades in there it
will be $40 it's gonna be available
October 13th on their website at for
shimmers five mattes and one semi matte
it's also cruelty free and vegan okay so
first of all I get like I said a huge
congratulations to Laura
I'm never gonna take something like that
away from someone um because that's
that's amazing and I can only imagine
how much went into that for me myself
personally I'm not a huge fan of Laura
Lee I have watched her on YouTube I used
to be subscribed to her and I would
catch all of our videos I follow her on
snapchat as well and just kind of got to
a point where like I just couldn't do it
anymore
it just was everything was very like
over the top and I don't like talking
badly about people but I also you know
wanted to just take a minute to to
explain myself and and why I thought
that way but it was just a little bit
over the top for me and with some
youtubers especially the ones that you
know are in the million subscribers and
stuff
it is very easy I think to be rubbed the
wrong way by things that they say or do
our show especially on a platform like
snapchat like sometimes it just can just
it can just give you bad vibes and I
continually would feel bad vibes from
her snapchats to the point where I was
just like I can't do it anymore huge
bummer and but you know I understand
that happens I think it's happened to a
lot of other big youtubers as well it's
easy to let things go to your head and
things like that I mean for sure I could
I can only imagine so it's a bummer but
for me I just don't I just don't like to
watch it it just like I don't know it's
just not my style it's not my vibes so
unfortunately I do not you know really
follow laura-leigh I can't say I'm a
huge fan again doesn't take away from
the fact that you know this is this is
really major for her and that's really
exciting but I just can't really get
into it though but that being said like
if we took that part out or you know if
I didn't know who Laura Lee was and I'm
just looking out the I showed up hello
what do I think what I want to buy this
the first thing that I thought when I
saw the inside of the eyeshadow palette
was was that I thought it was pretty
basic I feel like it's kind of what
we're seeing a lot of lately there
really wasn't a shade in here or
anything in here that I'm like who okay
like to me I was like okay so that's
that's it like and what I to be honest
it was almost kind of like a letdown for
me because people were getting really
excited there was like sneak peeks of it
we knew it was coming we knew it was
happening
and then we get the inside of the
eyeshadow palette and I was just kind of
like oh because you know even though I
say that you know I don't follow her on
any other platforms if she's gonna
release something that I think it's
freaking amazing catches my attention it
has me all hyped up I'm gonna buy it
because it's not that I'm not going to
buy any for a cosmetics line I'm just
saying I'm not a huge supporter of her
wares maybe if it was someone else that
I am a huge supporter of I would like
buy everything I would be so excited for
it and looking at the palette it just
doesn't scream out to me and appreciates
like the mattes in there like being able
to create a full look but I think it's a
very kind of like basic safe palette and
I mean maybe that's the route that you
go when you release your first product I
don't know because I've never been in
that situation but I think it's a nice
you know kind of safe neutral palette
for the first product release $40 that's
high for an eyeshadow palette I you know
I definitely think that's a higher end
for an eyeshadow palette so that was
another thing that kind of like made me
like okay I'm not so sure about that so
that was kind of a bummer to me but
that's kind of what I think I just
thought it was too basic to neutral too
plain to like kind of everything that
we're getting and then she wants you to
spend $40 on it and I think that's
pretty high so you know with all those
different reasons combined I'm not going
to be purchasing the cat's pajamas you
know just because I don't watch her
YouTube videos and such and I maybe
don't always get along with her
personality or things that she says I'll
still watch you know for her cosmetics
line if there's something that calls out
to me you know I'm not gonna to hesitate
to think about if I need it or want it
in my collection I'll be curious to see
what else she comes out with but I would
love to know of course your thoughts
this was the most requested I got so
many snapchats on this I got so many
Instagram tag is on this I would love to
know what you think are you a huge
supporter of Laura Lee and you can't
wait to buy everything did you have any
of the same thoughts that I did what do
