today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about makeup and new launches and new
releases and you guys know about them
and also answering if I will buy it or
if I'm not gonna buy it and then why are
why not like I said I do post these
videos every single Wednesday so I will
have my playlist linked up below in case
you were interested in checking out past
will I buy up videos but my beloved my
videos I usually have a lot to say so
why didn't we go ahead and hop right in
the first item that I want to talk about
a beginning asks a lot of questions
about this one from Laura Mercier it's
the light struck prismatic glow palette
I'm looking at the trend mood one
Instagram page it says this is a Sephora
exclusive it's also a limited edition it
is $52 for the light struck prismatic
glow palette by Laura Mercier it
features five multi-dimensional cream
highlighters that use the interplay of
light fused with the optical effects of
a color Eclipse so I will insert a
picture in here like I normally do when
my will abide videos I am NOT getting
this one fifty two dollars is pretty
expensive also like everybody's coming
out with highlighters right now
everybody's coming off highlight
palettes it's like pure insanity at this
moment I did just purchase the Anastasia
Beverly Hills and Nicole Guerrero glow
kit if you have not seen my video on my
shattered palette from Sephora I'll have
that link down below in case you want to
check it out but I did just get that
palette and then I still do plan on
purchasing a Casey Holmes highlight
palette as well I talked about both of
them in a past will i buy it video so I
do plan on purchasing those palettes and
like I just feel like I'm fine now with
highlight I do have the nicole palettes
glow kit on my cheeks today so I feel
like I'm fine highlight wise so I
definitely don't think I need this $52
it's more expensive anyways I think
you're getting five shades I paid $40
for the Nicole Guerrero one and I was
getting six highlights and I don't know
they're all cream highlights which I'm
not quite sure how I feel about that I
like cream highlights but I don't know
if I
a palette of just scream highlights so
that's interesting but also I'm not
hearing great things about this I've
seen people getting it and I'm just not
hearing the greatest feedback on it so I
just really don't have an interest in
this one but let us know what you think
did you guys get this one
what was your feedback on it like I said
I just I don't know if I've seen a
positive review yet so if you guys got
it and you love it let us know in the
comments down below or if you got it and
you don't love it let us know why but I
always love reading your guys's comments
and seeing what it is that you're
getting and what you're deciding to pass
on and all that good stuff via the Laura
Mercier lights truck prismatic glow
pellets I am NOT going to be getting
this one the next item that I want to
talk about is from Stila I have had
these on my list to talk about for a
while now but other new releases were
coming up and I felt like more requests
for going towards those products I kept
pushing this one back but this one is
still being asked about so I did want to
include it in a video this is from Stila
it is their magnificent metals glitter
and glow liquid eyeshadow I'm looking at
the Sephora website these are twenty
four dollars each they have a variety of
colors at least seven colors maybe seven
or eight colors it says they are
brilliant and long wearing liquid
glitter eyeshadow so I have been seeing
a lot of people talk about these at
first I was seeing a lot of people
swatch them and I was like oh my gosh
these swatches are pure insanity like
these like crazy and so I'm watching
people swatch them and they seem so
excited about them and I'm like yes I
definitely like I need this are you
kidding me so the Nicole girl glow kit
was going to be available on the Sephora
app only a little bit earlier than it
was being launched online and so I was
that's how I placed my my order for the
glow kit and there was a couple other
items from Sephora that I wanted to get
so I added them to my bag so I could be
all ready so when that Sunday came
around I could just add the glow kit and
checked out and I put one of these Sela
metals in there I think I picked out
rose gold retro I'm pretty sure was the
one that I finally decided I wanted to
go with I love rose gold I thought that
would be a good mix for me so I put rose
gold retro in my bag and then
in Friday night and then Saturday
morning I didn't do anything I was just
watching YouTube videos hanging out by
myself and I started seeing people put
these in makeup tutorials and review
them and I was like ah awesome you know
maybe I'll change my mind of what color
I want and everybody was saying how bad
the fallout is on days I think I watched
kathleenlights and I think rachel loves
had one too or they say the fallout is
just really bad and if you put it on and
then try to blend anything else over it
the the glitter is falling out I think
Casey Holmes mentioned that the glitter
fall out as well and I'm just like oh
hell no ah glitter irritates my eyes and
I haven't heard a lot of people say that
it's irritating on the eyes I think
maybe Casey did but I haven't heard a
ton of like oh you know it makes my eyes
burns because I have like glitter liners
from NYX that truly burned my eyes they
hurt so bad I hadn't been hearing a lot
of that but when people are saying the
fallout was happening I'm like no cuz
that's the last thing I want is like a
rim of glitter around my eyes like just
looking like a fool no no so once I
started seeing multiple people start
saying that I was like you know what
really the only thing I've been seeing
at first was people just watching it and
saying how beautiful the colors were but
now people are really trying them on
trying to incorporate them into makeup
looks and yes they look stunning on the
eyes they look beautiful on the eyes but
I'm not about to play around that
fallout it's $24 which is more expensive
anyway for you know just an eyeshadow
that I'm not gonna wear this glare
eyeshadow on a daily basis or even
probably a weekly basis like this is
going to be a special thing that I would
reach for Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy
glitter liner and I think it's so
beautiful it doesn't irritate my eyes
and I think I've used it like maybe
three times even though I love it so I
mean it's not gonna be something that
I'm using on a super regular basis so I
was kind of like I don't know if I need
it but the spot just looks so beautiful
so I decided to go for it but then
actually seeing it in action and seeing
the feedback I'm like nope not doing it
so when I place my order for the glow
kit I had already taken that out of my
bag so I think for right now I'm going
to go ahead and pass I believe the
Sephora VIP sales coming up in April
this might be something that I would
consider getting for like you know
have a 20% off coupon type of thing but
I don't think I would pay full price for
it I don't think I'll use it on a
regular basis and then just seeing
people complaining about a lot of
glitter fallout I don't I don't want
that happening so I decided to not get
the Stila glitter eyeshadows but I
almost did it I almost I almost did it
had I not seen those videos I probably
would have still purchased it but I'm
gonna pass over them but let us know in
the comments down below did you get any
what shades did you get what do you
think about the fallout did they burn
your eyes I'm super curious to know or
did you decide to pass over these as
well leave us some comments down below
oh this next one I feel like the tags
just recently started coming in you do
want me to talk about anything in a
lullaby video you can always snap it to
me or send it to me on Instagram or a
lot of times people are just tagging me
on Instagram right on a product so you
can do that and I just screenshot
everything but the tags have recently
started coming in on Marc Jacobs beauty
is coming out with a few new products
last year they came out with a coconut
primer and I know people have really
liked it and now they're coming out with
more from this kind of like coconut type
of collection so they have a coconut
bronzer which is $49 and limited edition
a brush which is $78 and limited edition
high as coconut setting spray which is
$39 and a coconut liquid gel highlighter
which is $44 I'm looking at the trend
mood one Instagram page it says will be
available very soon
should it be dropping anything now if it
is available at the time that I put this
video up I will leave it linked in the
description box down below this is
online at Sephora and all of their
stores March 31st officially in stores
in April well insert some photos down
below of what I see so a $49 bronzer no
I'm probably not gonna get it I just
recently got like I feel like I've just
has been buying a ton of bronzers and
contours I got the benefit quickie who
look contour stick I got a new elf
bronzer I got into Clarins bronzer like
no I don't need another bronzer right
now so that's a no a $78 brush no no I'm
not getting a $78 brush no I just got a
few new brushes from Sigma and none of
them cost me 78
so no I'm gonna pass over a brush it
looks really pretty I mean it looks like
a cute brush but now I don't need a $78
brush in my life a coconut setting spray
for $39 honestly this is the one that
I'm kind of like that sounds fun right
it doesn't say it's limited edition I'm
probably not gonna get it I don't use
setting sprays a ton half the time I
forget like no I don't need it I don't
need it I almost did you see that I
almost did it but no if I think about it
I probably wouldn't get enough use out
of it so I'm gonna pass over that and
then the coconut liquid gel highlighter
$44 no I don't need another highlighter
in my life right now don't let me buy
any highlighters please you guys please
please please if I say I want a
highlighter talk me out of it you guys
did a fantastic job talking me out of
the violet boss ride-or-die palette whoa
you guys talk to me on buying that
palette thank you so much you saved me
$75 so if you hear me saying like I need
another highlight in my life remind me
that I don't because I truly don't so
that's it that's the whole collection
I'm not doing it
haha bummer no I mean not bummer I mean
I don't I don't need any of these
products but um no I guess I don't need
anything as I was saying it out loud I
just I I simply don't need anything from
the collection I really do like Marc
Jacobs Beauty I'm from what I've tried
of them I really love the highlight in
the spotlight or spotlight or something
like that it's a it's a cream highlight
it's the one that like looks like a
deodorant stick I really like that
highlight I feel like I had something
else from Marc Jacobs but I can't think
of what it is at this moment as I look
around my office like it's gonna pop out
in front of me um I like them you know
obviously it's a little bit more pricey
it's definitely a higher-end
brand for sure but I just don't need
anything I think they have a little guy
on Sephora as like a point pert
or not a point perk but like if you
spend $25 it's one of the weekly
specials and you can add it to your cart
but I can't think oh here it is you can
get what can you get oh you can get the
coconut setting mist with the 25 dollar
purchase or more
I bet it's already out of stock though
but in case it's not if you need to
place an order with Sephora soon take a
look and see you might be able to get
that
and try it out so there's that but no
from the new Marc Jacobs coconut
collection I'm gonna be passing over
everything what let us know in the
comments down below if you're picking
anything up or if you're gonna pass over
it the last item that I have to talk
about is from Benefit Cosmetics and this
one's giving a lot a lot of tags you
guys are super curious about it I'm
getting a lot of snaps about this one so
I'm really excited to talk about it this
is the cheek parade a new face palette
they also I think it was last year or
last spring last summer they came out
with the cheekathon I think it was
called and this looks like pretty
similar to the cheekathon except this is
called the cheek parade inside it
includes hula-hula light California
dandelion blush and a rocket or from the
trend moon one Instagram it says it's
coming soon around March to the US and
other countries it doesn't have a price
on it if I can find the price I can
insert it in here or put it in the
description box down below but I want to
say that cheekathon was like $58 because
I almost bought it so I think it was $58
so I'm guessing this one would be $58 or
right around that price point as I'm
looking it doesn't say if this is
limited-edition but the cheekathon I'm
fairly confident was a limited edition
palette but I can't remember I'm not
sure I try not to buy a lot of limited
edition because it's harder to talk
about when I'm going through makeup
products or doing tutorials or things
like that people get upset if they
couldn't get something and it you know
it's already sold out so I try to limit
what I buy that it's limited edition
this one I'm not sure yet I can also
leave that information down below if I
see it before I post this video but I
almost bought the cheekathon palette and
I didn't and it was actually kind of a
regret because I still hear a lot of
people really liking it but I'm just not
sure about this one because I have a set
from benefit and it came it was called
like the bronze of Champions and it came
with like the hoola bronzer it came with
the what's up highlight it came with
like a lip gloss and some eyeshadows and
they're all packaged really nicely in
this box but I hate getting it out like
I've been wearing the hoola bronzer
quite a bit more lately because I bought
that hoola contour stick and I
get so mad every time I have to pull the
box out just for the hoola bronzer like
I wish I could pop that bronzer out and
that you know what I'm saying I don't
know maybe that sounds really dumb and
like I'm too lazy to pull a box out but
like if all I want to wear is the
dandelion blush it would annoy me that I
have to pull out this whole box you know
but also as I'm looking at it I already
have the hoola bronzer and I already
have the dandelion blush so that's two
items in there that I already have the
gal for NYADA looks pretty cool rocket
or looks cool hoola light I'm not sure
would be for me though I know that's a
new shade to them they just released the
hoola light and I don't I don't know I
guess maybe if I'm pale like this that
would do something for me but I think
that one's just a little bit too light
like when I bronze my skin like I like
every Browns like I love bronzing love
it so I think that one would be too
light for me so really I feel like the
only two I would use are the rocket or
in California and it also comes with a
brush as well so it comes with one of
their little I don't know what they call
them but they like a lot of their the
blushes and like bronzers and things
like that they come with that little
brush but yeah so now that I actually
look at it and think about it and see
what shades I already have I don't think
this would be a good purchase for me
that bums me out because I actually was
kind of thinking maybe this would be for
me but no not using one shade and then
already owning the other two it just it
wouldn't make sense for me to purchase
it it would probably better if I just
purchase other items on their own and I
don't to love them enough to want to
purchase them on their own you know what
I'm saying so it just wouldn't make
sense to me so bummer
talk to myself out of that one so yeah
so I'm not going to be getting the cheek
braid from benefit okay so there's that
but let us know in the comments down
below did you guys get the cheekathon
pallid you love it what do you think
would you get the cheek beret palette I
would love to know if you guys are
thinking about getting this one so let
us know in the comments down below and
