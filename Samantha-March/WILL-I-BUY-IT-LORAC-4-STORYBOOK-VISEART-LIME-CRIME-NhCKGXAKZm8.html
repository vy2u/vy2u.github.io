today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I plus my will about videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them I do have a playlist with all
of my will I buy at videos that I will
leave link down below in case you were
interested and catching up on any of the
past videos but I always have a ton to
talk about in these videos so why don't
we go ahead and get started
so first up is a pretty recent product
that I started giving some new tags on
I'm looking at the trend mood one
Instagram page and typically I read from
it so I will have her Instagram link
down below I suggest that you go check
her out over there but this is a from
Lime Crime makeup they just released the
pocket candy palettes they are Polly
Pocket inspired nostalgic toys and sweet
confections five full-sized shades
smooth formulas and comes in a glossy
mirror compact so I will leave a photo
of these down below because they are
pretty interesting looking looks like
there is three different palettes there
is sugar plum and the pink packaging
bubblegum and the blue packaging and
pink lemonade in the yellow packaging
each of them have the five shades inside
they're $34 apiece or $80 if you want to
get all three of them it looks like they
are available now on the lime creme
website so I will leave that listed down
below I have never purchased anything
from Lime Crime I do hear about them you
know every so often I think I've told
this story before but I almost made a
purchase from Lime Crime in the past
everybody was wearing I think it was
called like their velvety Velveteen
lipsticks if I'm saying that correctly I
was gonna purchase from them and it was
like two days before I went to make my
purchase or something there was some
sort of scandal with them and it scared
me off from purchasing because I know a
lot of a lot of the part of it was that
like people's credit cards information
was being stolen from the website and
things like that and I was like well
that's the last thing I want to happen
to me so I didn't make the purchase and
then I just kind of have never I don't
know nothing nothing from then has
really caught my attention I think there
was a lot of issues after that whole
thing like upset people and I think the
way that the owner came back with it
wasn't like the greatest conversation
ever so I don't know I just kind of like
shelled it
really never came back to it so I've
never actually made a purchase myself
from Lime Crime I think everything is
like smooth sailing once again that what
the company let us know if you have any
experience with ordering from LEM creme
online down below but I think everything
has like gone back to normal this was
probably you know three years ago or
something but it's just kind of
interesting how like one thing can kind
of you know influence your future
decisions and things like that but I've
never made a purchase from them so I
don't have any sort of familiarity with
lime-cream how they're ordering goes
customer service the actual quality of
their products I really don't know that
answer and I don't see it being talked
about at a time that like I said
everyone smile I see someone post you
know wearing a product from them or
something like that but I don't see a
lot of reviews for them or hear a lot of
feedback on them so I'm not sure that
always kind of makes me just a little
bit nervous to purchase from them so as
always you know a part of these wilayat
videos it's not only me talking and
giving my opinions but I also ask for
opinions a lot and I really do
appreciate all the comments that come in
because that's how I learn things too
and a lot of times I found new brands
and new products from these videos from
you guys leave in the comments so I do
appreciate that so I am gonna pass over
these right now though I get I get the
nostalgia and I get like 90s and things
like that are totally in right now like
hardcore for some reason I was never
really a big Polly Pocket type of gal
like hard-pressed for Polly Pocket and
nostalgia in my life it's thirty four
dollars for five I shadow
you know tends to be a little bit on the
pricier side I can totally see if you
were like a huge Polly Pocket man I
probably pocket collector and all those
things that you would probably want to
pick this up so that's kind of just my
feedback on there I don't even know
honestly just kind of like looking at
the swatches I don't even I'm not
gravitating really towards any of them
I'm gonna pass over these a Polly Pocket
inspired eyeshadow palette uh from blam
crime but as always let us know in the
comments down below if you were super
stoked to see this we've got a lot of
snapchats and Instagram DMS on this next
one I don't think it's because I've
talked about wanting to purchase from
this brand before
so buys art or vizier that just came out
with a new eyeshadow palette is called
the golden hour i shadow palette a
mixture of
shimmers and it's going to be a $49 it
does say it is a Sephora exclusive
online only again reading from the trend
mood site $49 and you get nine different
shades they're definitely the shades
right now that I feel like are very like
trending on trend this kind of orange
gold a red I see a blue there's darker
shades in there that looks like there's
lighter shades
I mean honestly like if these are your
tones and your vibes which they totally
are mine
I could see you doing a double take at
this palette because it's kind of like
everything you wanted one you're gonna
like wait what's that and caught my
attention a for short I can remember the
first Instagram DM that came in I mean I
didn't even know the brand I hadn't
clicked on the photo yet so I didn't
know who it was I just saw the picture
of it and I was like ooh what palette is
that like in my head I'm like drugs are
drugs for drug story and here is my czar
it was $49 I'm like I just don't know I
probably shouldn't I probably shouldn't
do it right now I know that the visor
palettes are extremely expensive they're
bigger palettes I think are more in like
the $80 range and a lot of people have
recommended to start out with their
smaller palettes because they are a
little bit cheaper and I can at least
try out the formula and I totally love
that idea and I totally get that idea
but I just don't think I need it right
now I made out again a part of the will
i buy videos or also to talk about
consumerism I got a long rant about
consumerism last week and buying just to
buy and I just don't need a new
eyeshadow palette right now I got the
subculture and I played with it for
weeks right and I was having so much fun
and then all of a sudden I got even more
eyeshadow palettes and sometimes it can
be kind of overwhelming each day when I
go to do my makeup and I'm like there's
five different eyeshadow palettes that I
still need to be reviewing and trying
out like I can't do five different looks
on my eyes every single day especially
with the holidays coming up and wanting
to get some holiday releases and things
like that and then of course holidays
buying gifts for the other people in my
life it's kind of a big thing too so I'm
trying as hard as I can to rein it
and go on a low bye I've heard the term
low buy happening around YouTube and I
appreciate that because nobody's really
difficult but I'm gonna try to be on a
low buy so I think $49 for a nine shade
eyeshadow pella it's just gonna be a
little bit too expensive for me right
now a little bit out of my price range
and I have other I showed up house that
I really need to get to and then I need
to be able to review so I'm gonna pass
over this visor palette even though it
hurts me to do it
it hurts me to do it I think this might
be a good one after when the next and
for VI vehicle comes around I will
definitely be eyeing it I added it to my
loves list so maybe when that event
comes around I could get it for a little
bit cheaper but for right now I'm gonna
go ahead and say no alright the next one
that I'm gonna talk about is another
eyeshadow palette lots of eyeshadow
palettes and then this week's will I buy
video I know a lot of people were really
excited for it and I talked quite a few
people buying it and let me know that
they are buying it but this is from a
story book at cosmetics and this is
their Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
a shadow palette it's going to be 55
dollars it was available September 15th
so it was already for sale but is still
in stock I will have it licit down below
looks like there is three six nine
twelve of different shades in there they
look to be very fun there's a nice
golden there a pink a blue just kind of
like fun bright colors a purple looks
like there's a mixture between matte and
shimmer so I'm looking at the swatches
correctly I'm just a lot of like bright
and fun colors I really do enjoy earlier
in the Chocolate Factory that was one of
my favorite movies as a child I have not
purchased anything from storybook
cosmetics yet but I definitely like they
are on my radar I should really do
another brands that I want to try
video.i plus it went back in the
beginning of the year but if I did
another video like that story about
cosmetics would be on there because a
lot of the items that they're releasing
really do catch my attention
unfortunately right now it's kind of
just what I've been saying in this villa
buy it video is that I don't need an
eyeshadow palette right now especially
one for $55 that is just really
expensive pour an eyeshadow palette and
I'm just kind of feeling very
overwhelmed I'm not sure if it's because
of you know all the holiday releases
that are coming up but I just feel like
every single day I'm just kidding like
boo-boo-boo-boo release release release
release and it's always like $30 $40 $50
$60 I'm like
oh my gosh like I just I just can't
right now I feel I think I'm feeling
just too overwhelmed by a lot of makeup
releases and a lot of really high price
makeup releases even from the drugstore
they're releasing $30 eyeshadow palettes
like I think I'm just getting
overwhelmed so I'm just like no I can't
I can't do it I can't spend fifty five
dollars on the eyeshadow palette right
now a lot of people seem so excited for
this palette and like I said I got a lot
of snaps and tags in letting me know
that you guys were going ahead and find
the palette which i think is super cute
again I don't know storybook cosmetics
myself so I can't speak to their
eyeshadow palettes or their qualities
the swatches did look really beautiful
again the colors are really fun and
cheery if that is your makeup vibes then
you might get along with this one just
great I thought the packaging was super
cute on it again I think I think I'm
just overwhelmed does anybody else
feeling that way because I think maybe
the trigger of it is the holiday
releases I feel like I remember holiday
releases last year that you know of
course there's a ton of them and it's a
huge deal but for some reason this year
I feel like we're just being buried with
them let me know in the comments if
anybody is feeling the same way as me
already the last item that I'm talking
about is the most requested this week I
got especially a lot of snapchats about
this one it's hot too gets how you
shadow palette that was just released
and of course it's from lorac cosmetics
as Ben mega Pro palette for alrighty
this one is for sale I was browsing on
alpha this morning and I saw it for Sara
look there as well so I will have any
links that I can find down below reading
from the trend moon it says that the two
first rows are matte with 16 shades the
two fountain rows are all shimmers with
16 shades and the total price is going
to be $59 you guys $59 for an eyeshadow
palette I'm like man I actually went and
looked at Ulta because for some reason I
had in my mind that their palettes were
$54 I don't know if I'm thinking Urban
Decay because I think the Urban Decay's
are $54 but for some reason I like in my
mind I had convinced myself but it was
$54 I went to Alton I looked at it and
it said 59 that is not a huge price
difference please don't get me wrong I
know that that is not a huge price
difference but for some reason it just
like devastated me I was like no not $59
I don't know why
I don't know why that was like that
tipped me over the edge I totally
understand that you are getting a ton of
shapes these mega Pro palette are huge I
shadow palettes so I really do
understand that you're getting a ton of
shades a huge eyeshadow palette a nice
mirror lorac does have really good
quality eyeshadows especially people say
our pro palettes are even better than
non Pro palettes so I get it I do I get
it and I even have so many all the
points you guys I have so many all the
points so when I saw it on Ulta I was
like you can just get a girl just get it
just use your points it's fine just get
it I just couldn't do it
I did mention one of the lorac mega Pro
palette in one of my past makeup that I
regret not buying videos and I was so
excited because that day that I was
filming they actually announced that
they were bringing it back and then I
believe that was the time that my my
computer died my hard drive crashed so I
was dealing with that and people were
stopping me like this came in are you
buying it I'm like no I don't have a
laptop
I can't work right now ain't like as
major as a hard drive crashing happens
in my life the last thing I'm thinking
about is makeup like I'm not buying
anything because I didn't know if I was
having to go out and buy a brand new
laptop without a moment's notice so I
didn't buy it and I think because I was
able to take a little bit and just like
kind of have a breather and you know I
was like I don't I don't need that and I
think if that wouldn't have happened if
that if my hard drive would not have
crashed I think the day that that
palette went for sale I would have gone
ahead and bought it I'm not saying I
would have regretted it because I don't
know but I think because I was able to
have some some time to think about it
when I went back a week later but still
in stock in the lorac website but I went
back and I looked at it and I was like
do you need that how's your has your
life been worse because you didn't have
that in your makeup collection for this
past week no let me I decided to that I
didn't need it so I talked myself out of
it so that was interesting because I
really really had high hopes and I
really wanted to get it but it didn't
that happened but that's just a little
little story there about why I didn't
get that one I think if I would have
gotten that one then I wouldn't said no
to this one just purchasing you know so
many in a row I think that I would have
been able to talk myself out of it so
because I didn't buy that palette I was
like oh here's your chance now you can
get the new fancy one that everyone's
gonna be so excited about but I just I
just I just can't so really trying to do
like makeup to clutters I've done a
couple makeup to clutters the past
couple weeks here I have some things up
for sale on my blog I'm doing a beauty
blog sale like trying to declutter it
not really minimal eyes don't think I'll
ever have like a minimalist makeup
collection but I'm at least trying so it
just feels really counterproductive to
be really trying to do all this
decluttering just keep bringing in more
and bringing in more it just seems kind
of counterintuitive like I said so the
the lorac mega Pro for that one was hard
for me to say no to because I was like
you did so good you talked yourself out
of the other palette like this is your
reward
you deserve that palette girl gonna do
it I have to say no and I'm gonna I'm
gonna try to stay strong here but I'd
love to no I know these palettes are so
very loved I know I got so many tags on
this one I think a lot of you are really
excited do you have all of the mega Pro
palette sir from lorac is this gonna be
your first mega Pro palette from lorac I
would love to know in the comments down
