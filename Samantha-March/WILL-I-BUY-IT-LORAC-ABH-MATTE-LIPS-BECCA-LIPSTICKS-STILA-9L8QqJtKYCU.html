today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it
I suppose my Olivia videos every single
Wednesday where I'm talking about some
new makeup releases and launches letting
you know a little bit about them and
then letting you know if I'm planning to
pick them up or if I'm going to pass
over them I will have my will i buy it
playlist linked down below in case you
want to see any of my past videos I also
am currently posting every single day so
if you haven't subscribed yet I hope
that you'll consider hitting the
subscribin if you want to get daily
content on makeup and beauty I do also
have 20kg boys going on right now for
both YouTube and Instagram so those will
be linked down below but with my will I
buy it I always have elections well so
when we go ahead and get started so the
first item that I got a couple tags on
was a new foundation from Stila
cosmetics it is their cover stick powder
finish foundation and concealer it is
$36 it has a powder finish its
lightweight medium to full coverage long
wear wonder resistant and fragrance free
it comes in 16 different shades it will
be available online at the Stila website
on July 17th and it's also going to be
an online exclusive to uLTA Beauty it
looks like some shades might already
actually be available any links that I
can find they will of course be linked
down below as well as all the
information I am reading from the trend
would one Instagram like always fill her
Instagram page is always a link in my
description box as well so I think I got
some tags on this one because I've been
trying out more stick foundations
recently it will say that it made me do
the double take are kind of like woo
feel what's coming out of the sticks
foundation okay that's cool so it made
me do the double take when I talked
about a lot in my will I'd buy videos
and I know a lot of you guys now put the
double take employee as well but I
actually considered it I was packaging
you know I read what it was about I paid
attention to the price but I thought
about that but I decided that I'm not
going to get it I definitely have been
buying more foundations lately except
kind of been like on a big foundation
take well high-end and drugstore so
would say I'm definitely on a foundation
kick right now and also our Sun just
like it's my lighting just got darker I
didn't want to pull my ring light out so
I'm just doing it natural light right
now and of course um and we didn't crazy
things but I actually
ended up deciding that I wasn't going to
purchase this one there's other
foundations simply that I'm just more
interested in right now one of them
being the Estee Lauder's they're double
where water foundation that I mentioned
in a recent Willy bite video and I said
I wanted to pick it up I am still
planning on picking that up so there's
just other foundations right now that
have my attention a little bit more but
I mean I will say that this one
definitely did catch my attention $36 I
don't think is a bad price I guess asaji
is only 25 but I think most stick
foundations are like 0.33 ounces of
product or somewhere around point 3
ounces of product this one is 0.5 2
ounces so I think from like a normal
stick foundation I think you might be
getting a little bit more I think I'm
saying that correctly so at $36 and you
know it doesn't seem like a bad price
it's available at Ulta I like to buy
from also because I like my point system
and all that fun stuff but I still
decided that I'm going to pass over it
for the reasons that there's other
foundations that I want to try out a
little bit more than I do the steel one
steel is not a brand that I'm loyal to
you know I everybody went crazy over
these like glitter eyeshadows I was able
to say no to them so I'm going to pass
over this new a stylistic foundation but
let us know what you are thinking about
this and if you're planning on picking
it up the next up I have a couple
different lip products that I'm going to
talk about the first one is from Becca
cosmetics they're coming out the lush
lip colors bomb it's a bomb and lipstick
and one so let's be a lightweight and
creamy formula and clear elegant
packaging so it's coming soon to their
website and then also to uLTA Beauty
aging looks super interesting of course
I'll be a photo insert it in here the
packaging looks very interesting to me
but for some reason when I like first
saw the packaging for some reason it
screamed out to me like cheap I don't I
don't know why I don't know if it's the
clear packaging or something that's
getting me but I'm like all of the
little look that's nice but that's just
me I mean obviously once you feel it in
touch it it could be completely
different but I think maybe it kind of
reminds me of the lorac lipsticks that I
just got my Beauty and the Beast
collection because those are kind of
clear and those are kind of should be
feeling so maybe that's why I am
thinking that I did just take a quick
peek as all to website it says they are
coming on July 18th so they will be live
by the time that this video goes up so
I'll have them linked down below
they're going to be $22 apiece so so you
guys know that I am a lipstick lover I'm
a lipstick addict I love triangle at six
I love triangle tips from all different
brands I feel like I'm just always on a
mission to try all of the lipsticks so
they definitely caught my attention but
even though I find them intriguing
I honestly think I'm going to say no to
these for some reason like the packaging
just kind of turns me off
I don't feel super drawn to them by the
packaging and it says it's a bomb and
lipstick in one like lightweight creamy
I definitely just do prefer matte
lipsticks not that I can't get on with
like a creamy lipstick but I've been
trying out the ones from the lorac in
the Beauty and the Beast collection all
the video going up in that collection I
think tomorrow it's going to go up I'm
wearing all Beauty and the Beast to it
well and I just sometimes when I wear it
looks like that's like too creamy I just
feel like it looks like goopy on my lips
and I just I don't like it and I just I
don't like the way it looks on me I
don't like the way it feels on me so I
kind of when I read what it's supposed
to be like I'm just kind of like I don't
know I don't know if I want that Sephora
is coming out with a new favorites
collection with some nudes liquid
lipsticks I mean I just got something
from lorac I feel like I have other new
ones because I feel like I'm buying a
lipstick everyday almost kind of
ridiculous my lipstick obsession but I
don't know man I think I'm going to pass
over these which kind of surprises me
because when I sat down to film I was
thinking I have a couple lipsticks to
talk about I'm like am told you buy both
of those because I would like want to
try the formula I want to try them out
but as I'm like looking more into them
I'm just like hmm the better ones just
not intriguing me enough and again kind
of like with foundations there's so many
other lipsticks out there and obviously
I have a huge lipstick collection like I
don't need any more lipsticks at all but
I can never like not say no to a
lipstick so I think I might has over
these becca lipstick kind of surprising
to me but I think I'm going to stay
strong and I'm going to go ahead and
pass over these lipsticks but let us
know are you feeling on these lipsticks
you think you got to have them or is the
lip balm lipstick formula combination
like totally your jam because if it is
you probably don't like these but for me
I don't think
my cup of tea so I'm say no and then the
next brand is coming out with a new
lipstick lunch is on associate Beverly
Hills
she is releasing some matte lipsticks so
looking at their Instagram so still
launched details it will launch on the
unsub's website in the US and UK on July
25th Sephora Ulta Macy's and Dilek
online on August 1st and then support
optimises Dillard's in-store launch is
going to be August 15th so insert a
picture in here it looks more in like
the regular lipstick tube is that I'm at
liquid lipstick but it's more in the
regular lipstick too but it's supposed
to be a matte finish there looks to be a
very large array of colors I saw one
photo that uh Nastasia post it was just
a bunch of nudes which I was like
interesting so I have to say especially
because we're talking about two
different lipsticks in this will I buy
it video you know even though I'm a
makeup lover a makeup addicts I don't
make a blogger have a YouTube channel
like sometimes I can kind of justify
buying more makeup than I normally would
because I say owls from our channel and
what Matt at the same time when I'm kind
of going head-to-head between two
different categories especially in a
whale i buy a video it really puts into
perspective for me like do I need to buy
both of these and honestly if I'm
putting Becca and Anasazi ahead ahead
I'm actually more interested in
Anastasio lipstick the only downfall
right now is that there is not a price
yet I looked everywhere trend Madonna
Sevilla legit up online there is no
price yet that I can find which is kind
of a bummer her liquid lipsticks are $20
her glosses I believe are 16 so I don't
know maybe somewhere in the 20 to 25
dollar range I guess maybe is what I'm
thinking
so probably somewhere in there which is
you know pretty standard but I like the
packaging more I'm really digging some
of these colors especially the news that
I'm seeing I like that it says it's
going to be a matte formula because
again that's just what I prefer if you
like the more creamy lipstick you're
probably going to like the Beca more if
you like more of the matte lip look then
you're probably going to like the
Anastasio more so for me I'm pulling
more towards the unstop deicide there's
also been a couple of products from
Anastasia that I've been waiting to pick
up like her blush trio
I still do want to pick up one of those
so I'm thinking maybe I could purchase
some new
items from Anasazi and kind of like
gruesome together to be able to do a
halt and you know play with them in an
upcoming you know tutorial or get ready
with me or something like that that I
could insert some of her newer items but
I am definitely thinking that I'm going
to pick up at least one of the lipstick
so you'd be really fun to be able to try
as a formula let you know what I think
have a lot of matte finish lipsticks
from the drugstore like from Maybelline
specifically kind of the first thing
that ran through my mind was like what I
have any drugstore dupes for that
foundations I'm just super curious to
try the formula I like the packaging a
lot more than the Becca one again the
only downfall is that I'm not sure of
the price yet but I really I mean I
can't imagine it being like super
absorbent or anything that is the final
piece if I have that praised by the time
this video goes up I'll have it in the
description box down below but I am not
sure when they will announce the price
of that but I'm definitely leaning
towards grabbing at least one of the new
I'm Safi Beverly Hills matte lipsticks
let us know if you had to put Becca and
abkhazia head-to-head like which one
would you lean towards I would love to
know your thoughts but I'm thinking I'm
going to pick me one up because I'm a
lipstick lover this the only reason and
then on to the most requested is of
course the new eyeshadow palette from
lorac cosmetics
oh man the amount of Instagram tags the
amount of snapchats I came in I was
getting tagged on Twitter about these
people are seeming to be pretty hyped
about these lorac unzipped palette and I
really do get it so they're coming out
with three new high shelf house I'll
have a photo inserted down here the
unzipped mountain sunset unzipped ocean
sunset and unzipped desert sunset these
fellas look so intriguing they
definitely made me do the double take
there are 42 dollars each and great news
they are permanent I love when I see
permanent items right now they're
available on the lorac cosmetics web
site and they say they're coming soon to
uLTA Beauty I did check the lorac
website right before I sat down to film
it and they are all out of stock which
is very sad but clearly if they're
permanent they're going to be coming
back at some time and they are also
coming soon at 2 uLTA Beauty so if you
did not get it when it did launch on the
lorac website it looks like you'll have
some more chances coming up soon so I
definitely want to get at least one of
these I haven't tried the lorac unzipped
palette I've only tried a couple of
lorac pro palette
brunch palate Pirates of the Caribbean
and also the Beauty and the Beast and
honestly those pallets have made me very
impressed with the lorac even the brunch
palette I know not a lot of people like
the brunch palette but for what it is I
really did like it I would love to try
the unzip formula I missed some of their
I think they had doesn't have unzipped
pellets in the alter 21 days of beauty
and I was too late they're sold out by
the time I was on the website I was
super bummed about it but I would
definitely love to try these I just
don't know a third I only need one you
know especially a $42.00 like I just
meet pick one palette I'm having a hard
time picking which one my eyes kind of
first went to the ocean sunset because
there looks to be like a really pretty
shimmer mint green in there that looks
so gorgeous looks like there's a gold in
there it looks like these all are a
mixture of matte and shimmers and then
each one has like a different theme but
yes I think right now I'm leaning
towards the ocean sunset just kind of
looking at the photos alone and the
swatches alone
I think the ocean sunset is the one that
is calling my name the most I would
really love to grap one to be able to
try out not only the formula just Co
kind of looks that can create would be
able to review it especially because
this is a permanent item which again
makes me so excited and again so
Sunday's went down but really just makes
me excited that it's a permanent item
probably wasn't going to buy it from the
lorac website anyways like even if they
were still for sale I would probably
wait till it comes to Ulta because
that's just normally what I do I have
the ultimate rewards which are amazing I
have to ultimately rewards credit card
or whatever that is too so I give you
them like more points so I mean I'm just
a really big fan of being able to shop
at Ulta so hopefully we'll have a date
soon for when it's going to be coming in
to uLTA Beauty if I find that
information work becomes available by
the time the video blows up of course
like I said everything is always linked
down below what's on my face and all
that that's always in the description
box as well but I think I'm leaning
towards the ocean sunset I'd love to
know did anybody grab these palettes
from the lorac website before they sold
out which one did you get so if you are
planning on getting them when they come
back to the lorac website or when they
come on also which one has caught your
eye the most do you guys want to see a
review video on this because that will
also factor into my decision I think a
lot of you what though just on the
amount of tags I had to put this in a
will I buy a video I think a lot of you
would like to see you know maybe an
upcoming review or tutorials
using at least one of these pallets
l-let me know your thoughts down below
but I'm super excited for I think as
soon as it gets salsa Beauty I will be
purchasing one of the new lorac unzipped
palette a lot of hype about these guys
but they look pretty darn good so I am
all about it but then after that one
that's going to do it for this week's
will I buy it if that is everything for
this week so will I buy a video I really
hope that you guys enjoy the video as
