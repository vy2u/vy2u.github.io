today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my little bite videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
lunches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm going to pick them up or pass over
them so like I said I do post the boy
advice every single Wednesday I do have
a playlist I will leave that link down
below in case you want to catch any of
the past videos and then I also post on
Thursdays
Sundays and Mondays so you get videos
from me at least four times a week
sometimes a bonus video here and there
but I hope that you will consider
hitting the subscribe button because I
am being notified for when I post new
videos and all that good stuff but as
always with my will I buy it I have lots
to talk about so why don't we go ahead
and get started so I got quite a few
tags on this from the balm I want to say
that I have talked about the bomb in the
past rely by video but I can't remember
what it was or what it was about and
might have just wrump that I'm not
really sure but I got asked a lot of
questions about the new wisp foundation
from the balm cosmetics
so they come in eight different shades
and they are $22 each and from the trend
moon Instagram it says it has a whipped
texture very light airy and moussey so I
have some photos inserted down below I
do always tag trend moods Instagram page
in his Bolivian videos because I often
am reading information from her
Instagram and I just think she has a
really good Instagram with letting us
know about new launches so it really
comes in handy for these videos $22 it
really doesn't seem like that bad of a
price and it looks like it's in like a
little jar and I like the idea of like a
whipped foundation I don't know I
thought that sounds really intriguing I
definitely am like super into
foundations lately I've been buying more
and more of them lately
both high-end and drugstore I'm just
very interested in curious and trying a
lot of different foundations and some
kind of action thinking about this one I
don't have a ton from the balm and I
would love to you know be expanding my
makeup collection and trying out
different brands I want to say the balm
you can get them on their website I
believe that you can get them at Kohl's
and I'm not sure where else you can't
get the balm so many times where I've
almost bought something from the balm
look I get a
have people recommending their liquid
lipsticks I think it is and I almost go
to do it but they are a little bit
pricier but I don't know I guess I don't
feel like $22 is bad for a foundation I
don't know I think I might actually give
this one a shot what are you guys
thinking about this foundation it sounds
a bit like the very light and airy it
makes me wonder how well the coverage is
going to be because I'm finding myself
more lately like I don't love full full
coverage foundation but I don't like
super light coverage foundation various
what the coverage would be like but I
don't know I might actually try to go
into my clothes and see if they have
them there and maybe I can swatch them
and see what I think maybe the coverage
could be like but I'm interested in
these I know I think they have a couple
more new releases coming out but let me
know in the comments down below of what
you think is a bomb what you have from
them that are your absolute favorites
that you think I should try out and what
do you think of this new foundation I'm
kind of into it right now I think I'm
going to go ahead and get it because
like I said I'm just super into buying
foundations trying out new foundations
and I just don't have a lot from the
balm so like why not give another brand
to try and get a few things from them
but yes let me know in the comments down
below what you think of this new
foundation and if you will be picking it
up a lot of people have been asking me
what I think about the big old tart
collection that just dropped so tart
recently came out with a lot of new
items and I've been getting a lot of
tags on it I think because a lot of
people know that I really liked art as a
brand I have a lot from Tarte I believe
Sunday's video was all about their new
stick foundation and also their clay
play palette I'm actually wearing full
face tart right now except for my
highlight my brow and my eyeliner but
everything else foundation concealer
setting powder eye shadow liner I mean
all of it on me my lip everything is
tart I just filmed this for Instagram so
it'll be up there but it is using our
new stick foundation in the clay play
palette so if you haven't seen that
video I'll link it down below I'm giving
away one of the clay play palettes so
you can go check it out and check out my
thoughts there came out with rainforest
of the sea radiance drops $32 I'm going
to pass over them I don't need any
highlighters right now they came out
with a limited edition make magic happen
I shadow palette looks like a 9 9 pan
eyeshadow palette nope I mean just got
an eyeshadow palette don't need it let
me transition leave your mark I shadow
palette for 30
dollars ah nope because I just got my
shell palette don't need it
limited-edition Amazonian clay smart
mascara nope I don't really do mascara a
lot because I'm also do splashes don't
need it
limited-edition dream baked eyeshadow
palette $30 milk don't mean a shadow
palette limited-edition miracles from
the Amazon eye and cheek palette $38
nope let me the pilot the sweetheart
fragrance which is $24 I think I talked
about that in my anti haul and not
interested limited edition be your own
TARDIS eye and cheek palette $38 nope
don't need it sex kitten liquid eyeliner
$20 I love liners but I just got a new
one from DHC that I absolutely love
so nope don't need it limited edition on
the prowl custom magnetic palette it's
$10 don't need it I actually if you saw
my blog got a really cool magnetic
palette from Tarte actually from my
friend Tinka so don't need it a smoothie
blender foundation brush $28 I don't
need another brush and I'm like I have
so many makeup sponges it's just not
necessary so my kind of overall thoughts
on the collection is that it's just too
much for me it's too overwhelming I'm
the person that gets like overwhelmed
when companies come out with this many
things at once like it just is
overwhelming to me and makes me not want
to purchase things I'm not really sure
why I'm that way but it's just it is
what it is I do felt hurt on snapchat so
I've seen some of the new releases I was
like okay okay and then all the sudden
it was like saying Sam Sam Sam Sam and
I'm like well you just came out with
sick combination and you just came out
with a clay play palette like it's just
too much it's just too much for me to
live in that really caught my eye was
the duo like the blush and highlight do
it almost kind of reminded me of the
Becca duos and for $30 I was like that's
not a bad price but I don't need it and
it's also limited edition and most of
the stuff is limited edition I think the
only thing I saw that wasn't limited
edition of was the rainforest of the sea
radiance drop the sweetheart fragrance I
don't think is and then the sex kitten
the liner and the brush okay so those
are the things that are not limited
edition but the things that would excite
me the most I am cheap L it caught my
attention there's two Iron Sheik
palettes they caught my attention the
dream big eyes shadow palette has some
really pretty like moths and pinks in
there that I thought was cute and
they'll leave your mark eyeshadow
palette which is very neutral but I mean
I just the clothes playing palette is
filled with neutrals and browns so I
just don't
anything but I also don't love that
everything is limited-edition like
sometimes it's huge limited-edition
collections just like do nothing for me
I say it in a lime I will I buy at
videos it's harder as a beauty blogger
to use limited edition items because I
know that I can only use them for a
certain amount of time and then when
they're not around anymore why am I
going to be like promoting them and
using them into my tutorials and things
like that when people can't get them
it's just kind of silly and I would
rather spend my money on items that I
can actually use for a long period of
time it just makes more sense to me to
pass over everything from this
collection like I said I really do enjoy
tart and I just got a couple new items
from them but the stick old collection
was just like way too overwhelming to me
too much limited edition almost like
just too much of the same thing like the
eye on the cheek palettes I don't know
just I just did nothing for me nothing
really excited me or stood out to me or
said like you absolutely need to have me
so I'm passing over everything from the
new Tarte collection that was coming out
but let us know in the comments down
below I know a lot of you guys liked art
too what from this collection of caught
your eye are you thinking of getting
what you think about it what do you
think when brands release these big old
collections are like a lot of limited
edition at once I'd love to know your
thoughts down below I have gotten a lot
of questions on this one I've been
getting tags on this for a while but I'm
finally talking about it because
actually releasing so Too Faced is
coming out with a new palette did you
guys just hear my dog star because it
was so loud like she I don't know if I
was like a snore or grunt what do you
think about Too Faced dairies she closed
her eyes again she's already not
impressed so they are coming out with
the glitter bomb palette it will be
available on June 15 has eight glitter
colors and two base shades so there's
that so I'll have some photos down below
so you can see it's a glitter palette no
I'm not going to get this one so you a
lot of you guys know that
Too Faced and I are on a break right now
we're not seeing eye to eye I've
mentioned it in some of my lullaby
videos and my anti hauls that I'm just
not really interested to face at this
time
I just had a mouse tied to me there just
like a company that's kind of like doing
one of these and I just prefer not to
buy from them at this time I have bought
a lot from them in the past they were a
favorite brand of mine at one point
believe it or not they were a favorite
brand of mine I mentioned in my Q&amp;amp;A
video that like I was one of the first
like product reviewers for to face like
way back in the day before YouTube when
I just had my blog they were sending me
like early products for me to review and
like reviewed not even for my blog but
for them before our product actually
released it I would review the packaging
and the actual product and the
marketability of their products so I
used to love Too Faced and I just don't
anymore
hopefully I truly do hope that they will
go back up again sometime I honestly
really do but I'm not sure you know I
know that they sold Estee Lauder and a
lot of people are pointing fingers at
Estee Lauder and you know as a parent oh
my salt of the two-faced decline I'm not
really loving what I'm seeing on social
media these like fights with other
people is just kind of like weird to me
I don't really understand what's going
on there but the biggest thing for me
outside of social media outside of who
they sold to outside of like what is
going on there I haven't been impressed
with their products bottom line that is
the main thing for me when it comes to
Too Faced and why I don't want to
purchase from them because I have been
buying some of their newer releases I
just have been very underwhelmed with
them and then even more than that when I
started to get off the train when I was
like okay I don't think I'm really a
nebari thing when Tuesday is because I'm
kind of like not feeling them and they
would still come out with new products I
would watch my friends and other
youtubers and beauty bloggers talk about
them and there's just not really a lot
of good things to be said about their
actual products take everything out take
everything else out of the equation and
I just don't like what they're coming
out with it's just not good quality to
me it's not worth the price tag of the
two-faced price tag I just think is
higher and for what you're getting it's
not worth it so what was the glitter
bomb it was $45 for eight shades um I
don't know I mean I guess that's pretty
standard to what I feel like this
palette would be if it was over $45 I
would probably pretty concerns but it's
also you know just thinking palette
and not brand wise I'm just probably not
going to get a ton of use at it I have
much more of like a straight mackerel at
all mats on my eyes right now shades I
don't know they just don't really do a
lot for me I'm not really big into
glitter I never am like the person left
like the red glitter all over my face
you just don't often see me using
glitter it's not that I don't like it
not that I don't like to like step
outside my cover and so on every once in
a while but it's not what I do on the
daily so this would not be a daily
palette for me at all so it spent $45 on
it it just isn't a smart purchase for me
and I try I try my best to make my
purchases I don't know is but I try my
best and I just know it's not needed and
I just don't love the brands I'm not
buying anything from them right now so
I'm going to pass over the glitter bomb
palette but I know a lot of you guys
still really love Too Faced and you know
some of you are loving the releases that
maybe I haven't loved and you love them
that's great that's fantastic I'm you
know I'm never going to tell someone
they're wrong because they like a
product that's insane but I don't know
what you guys think about the glitter
bomb palette like is this totally for
you are you eleven of glitter let's know
in the comments down below what you
think and if you're super excited for
this palette or if you're like me you
just don't need it or if you're like me
and you just one really love Too Faced
right now let us know in the comments
down below because of course I read in
respond to all your comments and I love
hearing what you guys think about these
releases as well but by far by far this
is the most requested product to talk
about this week and I honestly am
wondering if this is the most requested
out of like all of my will I buy it
because it was insane the number of
comments I was getting from you guys the
number of tags of getting from you guys
my direct messages on Instagram I would
scroll like this and it would be all
about the lorac and beauty and the
beast' collection
it was insane the number of tanks that
came in I don't know if you guys know
that I'm just like on the lorac screen
lately or figures know how much I love
beauty in the Beast I went to the movie
and I was telling you guys about it on
snapchat how much I loved it
so lorac is coming out this beauty in
the Beast collection and I didn't even
know this was a state like I literally
saw it and I think it went on I think it
was on sale the day I thought or it was
like releasing the next day and I was
like wait what happened because I feel
like we're kind of used to
giving sneak peeks and you know oh
here's a new collection it's coming out
in two weeks or you know hey if you're
two-faced here's a new collection it's
coming out on September great Cespedes
shake but lorac would like boom it's out
is here and I was like wait what I feel
like I had whiplash did anybody else
know that it was coming and if you did
why don't you tell me I'm so rude over
you guys and surprises me so it's a full
collection so we have a pro eyeshadow
palette which is $48 16 new and
exclusive shades a cheek palette which
is $28 with new blushes and highlighters
a lipstick collection it's $36 and it
comes with one two one two three four
five shades I believe in that quickly
and then a lip gloss collection for $34
which is one two three four five shades
again okay where do I even like what I
don't even know where I'm going to begin
so I do want to talk about the full
collection because so many people were
asking me about the full collection what
I'll say right now the lip glosses for
$34 I'm not really a huge lipgloss
person so I know that I can pass over
that right away
the lipstick collection for $36 I'm
lipstick junkie I love lipsticks but I'm
having like a huge problem buying
lipsticks and I I just I think that you
have to buy them in the set is what I'm
understanding correct me if I'm wrong
but I think you don't need to buy them
in the set for the $36 and I know that I
don't need all these shades like the red
I know I just want to use them all so I
don't think that would be a smart
purchase for me even though I really do
love lipsticks and I do like the lorac
lipsticks Brock did send me the Pirates
of the Caribbean collection and I did
like the lipsticks that were included in
there but I know it's going to be better
for me to pass over it right now
so the cheek palette is $28 and it has
new blushes and highlighters and it
looks like one two three four shades and
it's beautiful it's beautiful
I think I need this one yes I'm pretty
sure that I do I actually have lorac
highlight on today and they're cheek
palette and the Pirates of the Caribbean
collection totally surprised me when I
first
I was like oh yeah you know it'll be
okay and I was putting them on I was
like we stick and these are actually
really nice and I reach for that thing
all of the time the highlights are
amazing the blush in there is so super
pretty so I think I got a I think I got
a do it on the cheek palate guys it just
looks so beautiful the shades look so
completely me I love the packaging it's
freaking beauty and the beast'
$28 I felt up a bad price for four
shades Oh huh am I just talking myself
into it now but I don't feel like that's
a bad price and it just looks really
pretty I would love to have something
from this collection I really would and
I think that she palette is going to be
like my number one item that I want but
then to talk about the eyeshadow palette
I know a lot of people are very curious
about the eyeshadow palette so it's $48
for 16 shades the Pirates of the
Caribbean was $52 I believe but now I
can't remember off the top of my head
how many shades they had but the
eyeshadow palette you know honestly I'm
going to say it it didn't make me do a
double-take I know I know I know I know
so make me a bad person the cheek color
did that she followed up life hi girls
what's up the eye shadow palette I
almost felt like I was kind of when I
was looking at it like I was like you
needed it girl
you needed look at it it's beautiful and
feeding the beach seemed like lorac like
you need it when I didn't make me do
that an initial double take and so I say
in my lullaby videos if a product
doesn't make me do that I shouldn't talk
myself into it because there's so much
makeup I mean it's crazy vision I have
to talk myself into makeup and I just
don't think I have to do it it looks so
pretty and I love the packaging with it
it looks gorgeous it looks like it comes
with a brush honestly some of the shades
in here like I see will almost looks
like a black glitter shade and a blue
shade those kind of remind me of a
wetter and the Pirates of the Caribbean
and I don't know it's just something
about it didn't make me do a double-take
you guys and that actually makes me kind
of sad because if it did make me do the
double take then I would really like try
to talk myself into it I'm pretty sure
it would be that thing that I try to
talk myself into but it didn't and I
really want to hold firm to if it
doesn't make me do a double-take don't
talk yourself into it I really really do
want to like a stand firm on that
I know a lot of you guys are saying
that's really good advice and you want
to live by that advice too and I
appreciate that so it didn't make me do
it I just didn't I don't know why the
shades just to completely call out to me
yes the packaging looks amazing but it
didn't get my attention right away and
especially because the cheek palate did
get my attention right away you know
that's you know but you just got to
listen to yourself here listen to
yourself but that's kind of my thoughts
on viola rock and Beauty and the Beast
collection and I believe so these are
available on the lorac website I think I
saw two the reason it was going to be an
Ulta exclusive or did I make that up I
could have just made that whole thing up
I'm not sure really to think that I saw
that it was going to come to also but
now I've been looking through and
looking through Instagram and I'm not
seeing there or Italy so if it is I'll
have it in the description box remember
I listen like everything and put all my
information in there my outfit my makeup
everything is always in the description
box so if I find that out for sure
I will have it down there as well why
would you think about this collection
let me know what you're getting I wish I
could get more I really do wish that I
could get more but may was a huge month
of giveaways for me I was doing a lot
and fine a lot for you know my
subscribers and YouTube friends and all
of this and I have something else really
big coming up so I'm just trying to be a
little bit more careful with my money at
this moment so I'm really trying to
stand firm sue if it doesn't make me do
a double-take don't even don't even try
to go there just don't even try to go
there so I think I'm just going to grab
the cheek pallet from this collection
course let me know in the comments down
below I'd love to know if you guys are
