today's video is going to be a new boil
I buy it video I post my Familia by
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about
new makeup releases and lunches letting
you know if I'm going to buy them if I'm
going to pass over them and a little bit
more about each of the releases the guys
that I do post my will I buy it every
single Wednesday so I will have my
playlist linked down below I also post
on Thursday's Sundays and Mondays so you
do get videos from me
four times a week I hope that you will
subscribe to join the family I also have
two giveaways going on right now one is
my 15,000 subscriber giveaway is filled
with a ton of prizes from eyeshadow
palettes and lipsticks and skincare and
makeup brushes so many good prizes are
in there and then I am also having
another giveaway for the morphe 35o
eyeshadow palette so those will both be
linked down below if you want to check
them out but why don't we go ahead and
hop into the will abaya
the will I buy it I really count on you
to let me know what you want me to put
in these videos you guys can always send
me in your suggestions you can leave
comments on these videos or really any
of my youtube videos i read you respond
to all my comments you can send them to
me on snapchat at Samantha March tweet
me at by Samantha March or probably the
most common way is to just tag me write
on Instagram and I just screenshot from
there and March Beauty word over on
Instagram so I started seeing a couple
of tags come in for the new zueva
collection they are coming out with new
palettes called the sweet glamour
collection for spring and summer
there is a blush palette with two
blushes and a highlighter and then an
eyeshadow palette with 10 pastel shades
both shimmers and Matt this will all be
available on April 10th at the time that
I'm filming prices I'm not gonna
released yet I've not been able to find
the prices online I went to this away of
a website and while the blush and the
eyeshadow palettes are on the website
you can't actually click on them it'll
tell you that something has gone wrong
and there is no prices attached to them
yet I will have the prices listed in the
description box down below when this
video goes live for that information
will be I I don't need prices to know
that I'm gonna pass over this I actually
have never purchased from the wave of
cosmetics I do hear really good things
about them they're definitely a brand
that I would love to try out sometime
but as of this moment I have not tried
out anything from a zoeva cosmetics the
blush and highlight
you all know that I do not need any
highlights right now none on a no by for
highlights because I just added like a
bajillion to my collection for blushes I
really don't feel like I need any
blushes at this moment especially a
blush palette so I would pass over that
so the eyeshadow palette is the 10
pastel shades I just recently picked up
the brunch palette from lorac cosmetics
and honestly I really like that palette
and I love it to make the pastel looks
but I don't feel like I need to pastel
palettes in my collection because I
don't do pastel looks all the time like
it's fun and it gets me kind of out of
my comfort zone to do the pastel looks
but it's not something that I know that
I really need and like constantly reach
for so all the shades they look really
beautiful
you know there's some of them that do
look similar to what is in the lorac
palette there are some really fun like
Purple's in there and there's the blue
in there that it's like super super
eye-catching I think it looks really
nice it looks like a nice palette like
if you I know from doing the lorac
brunch I did a full like first
impression video on it there was
actually a lot of comments and there
were people saying like you are hardcore
for pastel looks and that is completely
awesome you know everybody has their own
things that they gravitate towards so if
you're a huge pastel eyeshadow fan I
mean definitely check out this palette
because it looks really beautiful the
other thing I'll say about the blush
palette - the two blushes in their look
to be super super pink like I just
that's not really the type of blush that
I gravitate towards um so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over this away of a
collection again I'll have links to it
down below
hopefully it's not sold out by the time
this video comes up and then I also have
the prices for both the blush palette
the eyeshadow palette elicits down below
again they both look really nice I just
know that I don't need them right now
not super familiar with zueva but most
importantly I just don't need them at
the moment and I can talk myself out of
it so I'm going passing over that but
let us know in the comments down below
are you going to be picking up either
the blush or the eye shadow palette or
both from the new as the wave of
spring/summer collection let us know I
got a lot of tags on Instagram for this
next product and I think it's gonna lot
of you know that I've been really
wanting to try out violet vos as a brand
so violet Voss is coming out with a new
eyeshadow
it is called math about you and includes
20 full-size eye shadows and all matte
shades and its $45 I'm looking at the
tread moon Instagram and it says it will
be available this weekend so the weekend
of the 8th which is also IMAX New York
so I know a lot of companies will kind
of put out into our products around the
IMATS time you can get them first
available at IMATS and then sometimes
they go on sale regularly on the website
so I think that's kind of what violet
boss is doing but again it's $45 I will
have it linked down below on the pilot
boss website if it is still available at
the time that this video goes up so
violent boss I have talked about them in
the 7 brains that I want to try in 2017
I have my eye real hard on violet boss
I've mentioned them and quite a few will
i buy videos but this matte palette I
mean it looks beautiful
and it looks like what I would want in
my life because I love matte eyeshadows
I love a good shimmer and I love a good
foil shadow but matte eyeshadows are
just like a wear dad to me I can create
a full look using matte shadows I love
my shadows so this definitely looks very
very beautiful there's a couple moms in
there that look gorgeous all these brown
shades and oranges it looks really
pretty but to be honest when it comes to
eyeshadow palettes I used to say that
I'm not an eyeshadow palette junkie I
feel like I have thrown that out the
window because I have bought a lot of
eyeshadow palettes I'm not an eyeshadow
palette junkie but I'm not not an
eyeshadow palette junkie and to purchase
an eyeshadow palette I wanted to make me
do a double-take I wanted to make me be
like oh wait what
what's that eyeshadow palette and this
one just didn't do it for me and I've
also said in a lot of my will I buy it
that I don't feel like I need to
convince myself to buy makeup because
there are so many makeup releases new
brands popping up every single day and I
just I don't need to convince myself
because there's going to be so many
other makeup products and eyeshadow
palettes that are going to catch my
attention so even though I think this
palette looks really nice and violet vos
is a brand that I want to try if it
doesn't make me do that double take
then I don't even need to think about it
I don't need to think twice about it I
don't need to convince myself I don't
need to heaven ha over it and watch the
reviews and try to decide I just know
that it's not going to be for me and
that's kind of what this palette was I
have a lot of matte eyeshadow
tell us I have a lot of my neutral
eyeshadow palettes I kind of have a lot
of eyeshadow palettes fire I stuff it so
it's not something that I feel like it's
really needed right now I've also had a
friend to tell me that she actually
purchased the Holy Grail palette for me
from violet boss or my birthday and I'm
supposed to be getting it in the mail
soon so that will kind of help fulfill
my need for you know being able to try
out by like foster out the eyeshadows so
I can get a good idea of what I think of
their products and how their eyeshadows
work for me so I should be getting that
in the mail shortly which is so cool I'm
so exciting I know that I have that
palette coming too and a pass over the
violet boss one looks really good if
you're a huge neutral person neutral
matte eyeshadow person I think that you
would totally love this eyeshadow
palette
I don't think $45 is a bad price for 20
I shadow but I just know I don't need it
right now but of course I would love to
know the comments down below are you
gonna get this one are you going to
IMATS as anybody going to IMATS New York
episode jealous I hope to get to an
event like IMATS or Jenn Beauty or
something like that I hope to be able to
go one of these days I think it would be
such an amazing experience but I'd love
to know in the comments down below if
any of you guys are going as well so let
me know but then also of course let us
know if you're getting this palette do
you have any of the violet boss palettes
what do you think of them let us know so
next up I want to talk about a
collection this one I got so many tags
on and I'm not sure why but I actually
was a little bit surprised I don't know
if I've talked about
g'way cosmetics at all of my will i buy
it yet I was getting a lot of tags on
their new rose gold collection it's for
their spring at 2017 collection so they
have a springtime in Paris eyes shadow
palette which is a $40 looks like it has
12 shades and if they look to be shimmer
and mattes of course I'll have photos
and here they also I have a rose gold
lip topper which is $16 a rose gold lip
cream which is $18 and then a rose gold
highlighter which is $24 so I will have
these linked down below so I have just a
few things from ziwei cosmetics and
they're all things that have come in
like subscription boxes I feel like what
I have heard the most from jouer are
their highlighters and then their lip
toppers so to go through the collection
so there I shadow palette it's $40 for
twelve shades I don't know that seemed
lessons a little bit pricey to me and I
shadow palette really doesn't do
anything for me no Rose all really deep
shades that I don't gravitate towards
much there's like a deep blue I don't
look the shades just aren't totally me
and I don't know for $40 I just I don't
just looking at this palette off the bat
and the swatches I think it looks nice
but I don't think it looks like $40 like
I'd rather spend the $45 and get the all
matte shade that came with like the 20
shades from by Lovaas so I just feel
like it's kind of expensive and like I
said I just got a lot of new eyeshadow
palettes so I don't need this one and
then the rose gold lift upper which is
$16 so you know I've never tried any of
their lip toppers but I know that people
have gone like absolutely bananas over
them so they look cool I've seen the
swatches of it I'm not sure I am a lip
topper kind of gal though just from the
swatches that I've seen it's just not
really me and I know that I have a
YouTube channel and I have Instagram
when I post makeup looks and I do makeup
tutorials but I'm also a very regular
person I do my makeup a lot of times I'm
not super super creative like a lot of
makeup artist I'm not a makeup artist I
will never pretend to be a makeup artist
so I don't know the lip stoppers for me
just I just don't think I would get much
use out of them besides like maybe for a
YouTube video and you know that's just
like not super practical it's fun to be
able to switch it up and like do fun
things but I can't like I have metallic
lips and I barely reach for them so I
just I can't fill up my makeup
collection and spend a ton of money on
things that aren't super practical for
me in my everyday life outside of what I
do for social media if that makes any
sort of sense to have the rose gold lip
cream which is $18 again I've seen
swatches of it and it just I just don't
feel like I need it it's also kind of
reminded me a little bit of the touch
and soul like foiled lipstick that I
just got I put it in my last full face
video using like new high-end makeup
that's like looking at the swatches it
really reminds me of what that looked
like and again it's more like the
metallic side and I just I don't wear
those a lot I wouldn't get good use out
of it it's super pretty I mean don't get
me wrong its way pretty but I feel like
I have something
I'm wearing my collection and I know I'm
not gonna wear it very often so I'm
gonna skip over that the highlight looks
really pretty I'm not gonna lie what is
my problem with highlights lately you
guys like I was off the highlight train
and then wow did I get on that train
fast that like I'm like doing the double
takes on the highlight like do I need
that no no no no I don't need it I know
that I don't need it and I know you guys
are gonna keep me in line so I'm gonna
pass over the highlight but it looks
really gorgeous again I hear really good
things about the GOI highlights so it
looks beautiful but I just I know I've
done a lot of makeup purchasing lately
I've been getting so many birthday gifts
from people and it's been so incredible
the Sephora vib sales coming up the
alter 21 days of beauty was just here I
got a haul to show you guys like no no
no I know I don't need it so I'm gonna
pass over there's you a rose gold
collection but that's a little bit about
it what you can get again the links will
be down below in case any of you are
interested in picking it up for yourself
let us know in the comments down below
did you get anything from this
collection are you still planning on
purchasing anything is this totally a
collection for you I would love to know
in the comments down below the last
product that I want to talk about is the
one that I've gotten the most tags on
I've gotten a ton of snapchats about
this line people are starting to lose
their minds a little bit
and I understand it is the lorac
cosmetics in collaboration with Disney
Studios they are coming out with a new
collection all around Pirates of the
Caribbean now they do have a full
collection which includes an eyeshadow
palette a face palette and lip products
I'm just gonna talk about the eyeshadow
and this one because that is what
everyone was asking me on was the g-way
collection people were asking
specifically for me to talk about the
entire rose gold collection with this
people are just asking me about the
eyeshadow palette and in efforts to make
my videos shorter because I know they're
long videos I'm just going to talk about
the eyeshadow palette so Pirates of the
Caribbean themed collection but also
this eyeshadow palette dang that looks
cool it took me a hot second to find a
price the eyes shadow palette is going
to be $52 it also comes with a deluxe
eyes eye pencil
it appears to be it will go on presale
April 11th so the day before this video
goes up it will be available for pre
sale at lorac cosmetics I will leave it
listed down below it will also
eventually be available at Ulta Beauty
and other stores so this palette first
of all the packaging is absolutely
amazing like just the outer packaging
super cool so it looks like we have one
two three four five six times three is
eighteen thick there is going to be 18
shades and I mean from a white to a
black it looks like they're shimmers
mattes greens reds I mean this palette
looks incredibly cool I'm a big fan of
Pirates of the Caribbean oh this is so
hard because I'm over here telling
myself you don't need an eyeshadow
palette and I'm going through this will
I buy a video and I'm saying I don't
need an eyeshadow palette but I'd also
said when palettes make me do a
double-take
I really have to stop and think if I
want that eyeshadow palette and you
betcha that this palette made me do a
triple take because it's so intriguing
to me I love all the names in here see
haze pirates chest lost at sea tell no
tales shiver me cursed like I love it
$52 is expensive for an eyeshadow
palette it's expensive it's expensive
for an eyeshadow palette it's also
interesting because my very first lorac
eyeshadow palette that I bought was the
brunch palette and when I did that video
a lot of people were saying to me don't
judge the lorac based on this eyeshadow
palette like not a lot of people like
that brunch palette I like it just fine
and people are saying don't judge it
lorac like you need a different palette
so I'm like should I get this palette
and be able to like compare I don't know
what to do I kind of wanted and so okay
so it says that it'll become available
at Ulta Beauty I have a ton of uLTA
Beauty points so maybe I could use my
points for this and then I wouldn't feel
as bad because I know I have more than
$50 and points at Ulta maybe I'll do
that because then I wouldn't feel as
guilty I could talk myself out of this
one you guys but I rely don't know how
to talk myself out of it you guys can
help me out leave me some comments down
below let me know if you think that this
I shouldn't get it let me know your
thoughts let me know if you absolutely
have to pick this up but I'm sorry it
just
it looks so cool it really does what can
I say it's makeup I love it
this should be a judgment-free zone
don't judge me because I've been saying
I don't need a shadow pellets and now
I'm on Pierce and I'm gonna buy one dont
you judge me those are kind of my
thoughts on the lorac palette I really
thought that I was going to like somehow
be able to talk myself out of it in this
video like once I started talking that I
would just talk my way out of it because
I've done that before and will i buy
videos but i think i just talked to
myself into it even more so let me know
