today's video is going to be a new a
will i buy it I post a will i buy a
video every single Wednesday so if you
are new to my channel then welcome I do
have the weekly will i buy it series
where i post each wednesday typically in
the mornings i'll post a new will i buy
it video i started the will i buy it
videos because i wanted a way to still
be able to talk about new products and
products that i'm interested in without
having to go out and buy everything
because that is just not feasible for me
so in the will i buy up videos i
typically talk about new releases not
always but most the time i'm talking
about new products and new releases
sometimes I will do sets of individual
products like what I'm doing in today's
video or like the last two weeks have
done collections so I will leave my will
i buy at playlist link down below and
somewhere here in this video as well so
if you're interested in seeing some of
my other related videos then you go
ahead and click on that and check them
out but I do have a lot to cover today
so why don't we go ahead and jump into
it so the first thing that I want to
talk about I do typically always ask for
you know what you guys want to see in my
will it bite videos what are you curious
about if i'll be purchasing or not and i
got a lot of questions coming in about
makeup geek and makeup geek just
launched some lipsticks this is their
first time doing anything with lipsticks
and they really came out of the gates
swings they just released the iconic
lipsticks which are twenty highly
pigmented shades in a mat or shine
finish to leave your slips feeling silky
smooth they came out with their plush
mats which are unique self matt creams /
moose formula that sits on top of the
lips and they also came out with their
plush creams which is a hybrid cream /
moose formula that doesn't settle into
fine lines or wrinkles so as of the time
that i'm filming everything is available
and already for sale on the makeup geek
website so that will be listed down
below so this i thought was pretty
interesting so i can try to touch on
each one real quick so the iconic
lipsticks like i said they have 20
different shades I think it's like half
hour and like the more matte finish and
the other half are in the shine finish
so it depends on what you want these are
all fifteen dollars and then just a
little bit more from
the website it says I'll come in a sleek
rose gun metal tube and it features a
unique color indicator on the cap so you
can easily find your ideal shade that's
pretty cool the packaging looks nice
again fifteen dollars these ones i don't
think i'm going to purchase i would
prefer to purchase map versus the shine
ones even though i did watch
kathleenlights swatch video where she
swatch naman she said she actually ended
up preferring the shines over the math
which was interesting but I just really
don't I'm not drawn to them if you watch
my will i buy at videos i talk about you
know how makeup really needs to speak to
me because there's so much makeup out
there there are so many new releases
something is coming out it's you know it
feels like every single dive new brands
are continually popping up and i don't
need to convince myself that I really
want to purchase makeup because there's
so much other makeup that I would rather
purchase for myself you know what I'm
saying so and these ones just really
kind of weren't speaking to me i liked
the packaging of them and i like how
they were like kind of like smaller and
skinnier and the color indicator cap is
nice because sometimes that can get
frustrating when you have a lot of
different lipsticks you know with more
of like the neutral packaging so you
can't see through and see what the shade
is although that was pretty innovative
but at fifteen dollars i think that i'm
going to pass on these ones and then the
other two lines that they came out with
the one was the plush mats lights
packaging on this one it's kind of the
more traditional you know you can see
through the tube see what you get like
maybe there's like 18 shades or so you
can buy them all in a bundle for a
hundred and sixty dollars if you want
all the shades or these are twelve
dollars twelve dollars i do like that
price point more than I like the iconic
lipsticks so honestly if I was going to
purchase any of these lippies from
makeup geek I think it would be these
mat once the plush matte lips I think
that I would go with that one more brand
new product to makeup geek so it doesn't
make me immediately I want to feel like
I need to go out and purchase this
entire set for 106 dollars or I need to
go home for just ten of the lipsticks
like I would probably purchase one to
two and see what it's like and feel it
out but again if I probably had to pick
from a line on these makeup geek
lipsticks I would probably pick those
but
I don't think I'm going to be super sold
on these and I'm kind of talking my way
through it as I'm doing these videos
like I normally do with my will i buy it
sometimes I don't have a firm opinion so
I need to like talk out loud and then
I'll get a better idea but then what was
the other ones was the plush creams and
these are all fourteen dollars and I
think there are nine different shades of
these you can buy them in the bundle
again and the bundle will cost you $95
Phillip lament inserting some pictures
in here as well so you can see the
different groupings of the makeup gift
lipsticks but I just thought it was
really interesting that not only for
their first time that they're coming out
with lipsticks they're coming out with
three different lines and technically I
guess maybe four if you break down the
iconic lipsticks that there are two
different finishes to them so they were
really we're not playing around again
the price ranged from $12 14 others at
fifteen dollars i believe that it was
i'm not going to lie i don't really
understand like the plush mat and the
plush creams looked like sit like
similar packaging i mean i know that the
formula is obviously different but it's
just kind of interesting to me that
there's a price difference for them but
for now i'm going to pass over these i
haven't seen a ton of swatch videos come
out yet i haven't seen a ton of reviews
come out yet so I don't really know what
it is people are thinking again the only
videos that I've watched on these was
Kathleen lights and she was watching the
20 iconic lipsticks and that's those
were kind of the ones that I had the
least amount of interest in I'm more
interested in the kind of like more
traditional liquid lipstick and I
haven't seen any swatches or reviews on
them yet so I'll wait and see what like
kind of the general consensus is the
general feedback and opinion but
honestly i'm not a huge like I don't
purchase from makeup geek a ton and I
don't know why and I feel bad saying
that because I like makeup geek they
were one of the first brands that I
started purchasing a base up YouTube
recommendations and everybody was
talking about this brand I own eye
shadows from them but I just don't a lot
and you know I know a big reason is
pawel because I like to purchase from
Sephora and alta because i like the
rewards and you know you can kind of
build it up and it kind of makes you not
feel so bad when you're purchasing a lot
and I mean here you can get samples and
your dough examples and then you get
points and you can redeem them and
it just makes me feel better placing
large orders and you can't get that with
some other companies but I don't know I
know that I need to try more makeup geek
and continually try and I i support the
brand i think they're great I i watch
marlena's videos and I think that she's
super interesting and you know what
she's done with makeup geek he's been
awesome but it's just not a brand that i
buy from a lot so I think if I did I
would definitely want to purchase these
because I would think it was super cool
but let me know what you guys think have
you guys purchased any of the lipsticks
yet from makeup geek or will you which
line are you most interested in but let
us know I'm really curious if anyone has
purchased from them yet and if you have
any feedback on themselves please do
leave that in the comments down below
but for right now I'm going to pass over
at the makeup geek lipsticks okay so
keeping on the lipstick trend what and
while just came out with some new
lipsticks they're called the mega lot
liquid catsuit matte lipstick looks like
there are quite a few shades maybe six
seven you're like 13 different shades
and they are 499 a piece from their
website it says what glides on like
butter feels like a second skin and
won't budge our liquid catsuit matte
lipstick made with glammed-out
superpowers it goes on glossy yet
transformed into a hyatt pigmented matte
finish with some serious staying power
read our lips this color is going
nowhere okay so that's interesting so
499 for that like I said there's
different shades from needs two things
to Red's to darks and browns so this is
one again this is a pretty new release
so I haven't seen a ton about it I
haven't seen any youtube videos on it
but I was reading some reviews online
and like on the wet and wild website and
such and the initial reviews there
really isn't much to go on but the
initial reviews sound like it is
actually pretty good I was a little bit
leery when I first saw them because i
purchased a liquid lipstick from like
their fall collection when they came out
with a couple of different lipsticks in
there and i really didn't like it it was
very patchy and streaky and just we
didn't get along I tried it out a
handful of times and I was like no I
don't I don't want to wear this color
anymore so when I saw this I was like
yeah I'm not sure cuz I was still
thinking of that liquid lipstick but the
good thing about what and wildest want
to probably
doesn't work out it doesn't make me feel
like super bad because they are usually
typically pretty inexpensive like I said
these liquid lipsticks are for 99 and I
do a lot of like my drug store shopping
at CVS there's usually like buy one get
one half off or some sort of coupon or
you have the CVS cash dollars whatever
the reward system is it doesn't make me
feel quite as bad so now that I was
reading those first couple of reviews
I'm like you know what I kind of do want
to try them out so let me know in the
comments what do you guys think have you
tried any of them yet do you think it's
worth it to do and or would you want to
see me pick up a few different shades
and do like a swatch video and test them
out for you guys let me know what you
think but at 499 I mean I pop into CVS
to like grab a gift card or something
and then I come out with makeup so I bid
that could possibly happen the next time
I go to CVS but let me know what you
think in the comments down below but for
the catsuit the liquid lipsticks from
wet'n'wild pretty sure i'm going to give
them a go so I saw a comment from last
week's will i buy a video and someone
was asking if I would talk about Julius
place so I thought okay I could talk
about it I wasn't sure exactly the
comment really just that Juve his place
so I wasn't sure exactly if there was
something specific to talk about so I'm
familiar with Julius is place I don't
have any of their products yet but I
thought maybe I could talk about the
eyeshadow palettes in this video if
there's something particular from this
brand that anyone would like me to talk
about let me know but I'm going to focus
on the eyeshadow palettes for right now
so like I said I've heard of them they
got a super-popular on Instagram a lot
of the big-name influencers we're
talking about Julius place using their
palates watching them that's where I saw
them from there has been so many times
where I have almost caved and gotten an
eyeshadow palette and I haven't done it
and then I get mad at myself because
they do look super interesting it looks
like they also have single eyeshadows
they have brushes on their website it
says even our lashes so they have the
Nubian I shadow palette that is the
green eyeshadow palette I can put a
picture in here it says that it is 2899
it looks like it comes with 12 different
eyeshadows this is one that I
has looked good but it hasn't been the
one that like I've kind of been eyeing
like when I say that I've been almost
like purchasing them that one hasn't
been it so there's the Nubian second
edition palette which is the yellow
palette again it has the 12 shades and
it is $35 of the masquerade mini which
is thirty dollars and that comes with 16
different eyeshadows then they have the
masquerade which is 39 99 so I guess I
don't really know the difference between
the mini and the regular masquerade
because on the website they let the
exact same so I I don't know the
difference between those two but the
ones that I have been really interested
in one is the masquerade palette it
looks so pretty it's got a lot of pretty
Browns but it also has a lot of fun pops
of colors like the blues and the Greens
now think not colors that I use a whole
lot but from what I've seen the swatches
in the tutorials with them they look
like really good shimmer shades and just
really fun colors that I've been like oh
okay I'm kind of I that one and then the
other one the Nubian two of the yellow
pellet the Browns and that palette like
I am such a brown eyeshadow type of girl
I have brown all over my eyes today and
it just looks like a palette that really
does speak to me so I like I said I've
seen a lot of different swatches and
tutorials and reviews on these pallets
and they do seem pretty good so does
anybody have any of the juvies place
eyeshadow palettes let us know in the
comments down below because this is one
that while I don't think I'm going to
purchase like right now or right away
again like these are not new releases
things like maybe after the holiday
craziness it dies down and then when I'm
trying to find a new eye shadow palette
I really would like to purchase from
juvie as this place because I've seen a
lot of the good reviews come in so i
think i would first start out with an
eyeshadow palette and maybe either the
masquerade or the Nubian 2 i'm not quite
sure yet but let us know if any of you
guys have them let us know in the
comments down below or which eye shadow
palette that you would recommend but i
know this isn't a newer type of release
like I said like the will i buy it's
usually focus on but I saw that comment
in last week's video and I thought
I've never talked about this brand and
it kind of gave me excuse to dig in a
little bit super and kind of reef amilli
rise myself with their eye shadow
palettes and swatches and what people
are saying about it so thank you for
that suggestion but i think that i will
buy from them just not right now because
of the timing and the holidays and all
that craziness i don't need to purchase
something right now for myself and need
to focus on other people but i think
definitely in the future 2017 i'm going
to purchase a palette from julius place
and the last one that i want to talk
about is again another one that i've
been getting asked a lot of questions on
and this is the que el polish from
kathleenlights so kathleenlights is a
very well-known youtuber and beauty
influencer she has done a lot of
different collaborations with brands
I've bought a lot of her collaborations
and been really happy with them and she
recently came out with her own nail
polish brand which is so exciting a
super cool I was really excited when I
saw it I watched her video right away
when she put out her video talking about
it but thought I was really exciting to
be able to see the beauty craters like
kind of doing their own things and I
just I was excited for her I i really
like capping lights she was one of the
first influencers that i started
watching and I just think she's very
relatable and personable and like I said
I think I've probably bought I mean so
many of her collaborations but I've just
been really impressed with everything
that I've bought so the KL polish is
available at I think it's just KL polish
com is the website I believe that's the
only place for it is available right now
i'll leave that link down below and then
they also do have a kale polish
instagram as well that i can link down
below so they come in the shades zoe
which it does say is sold out right now
brick sidewalk caramelo snickerdoodle
gumption and broccoli in chocolate and h
nail polishes eight dollars and fifty
cents i believe she said each of these
do have a shine to them as well so the
only one that is sold out right now is
zoe and she also was saying that she
thinks that she'll release more like
maybe like her seasons and things like
that when i was watching her youtube
video which i will leave that link down
below as well if you're interested in
and seeing what that looks like again
850 for each one i really like the shade
like the shade snickerdoodle is really
speaking to me it's just
that classic nude Zoe would probably be
my favorite but of course it's like
everybody's favorite so it's sold out
but snickerdoodle I really really like
and then also brick sidewalk i think is
a really interesting like good fall
winter color so for this one i would
have to say that again i think that i'm
going to purchase these ones again I'm
this will buy it wednesday is coming the
week before Christmas so it's kind of
crunch time for everybody else and the
food and the drinks that you have to
bring in the travel plans and all that
sort of stuff so I'm not purchasing
anything like right at this moment for
myself because I need to wait till the
holidays are over in that sort of thing
so even though these just released
fairly recently i haven't purchased them
yet for that reason holiday time and you
know being a real person who has to buy
real things for people so i haven't
purchased them yet but i do plan on at
least purchasing one i think that i will
get a snickerdoodle like to be able to
support Kathleen I think it's really
cool what she's doing and starting her
own brand I think that's really cool and
I would like to be able to support it so
like I said I think I want to pick up a
snickerdoodle I really like nudes if you
can't tell I like nudes and I do get my
nails done I do get acrylics put on but
I just have them either put the upper
legs on or do the fill and I don't have
them paint my nails or anything at the
salon and I come home and paint my nails
because I really do like nail polish and
I have a lot of nail polish and so when
I started to get acrylics put on I was
like at the first couple times I hadn't
paint my nails there and I had him do
the Schleck which you have to pay more
money for and it's harder to get the
shellac off and I was like why am I
doing this I'd rather just go home and
use my own nail polish especially then
because when you guys ask you know what
color is your nail polish I can say it
other than sang like I don't know it's
shellac from the salon so I do paint my
own nails at home I have a wide variety
of nail polishes in different brands
that I like so nail polish to me is
something that I do use very like on a
regular basis i use very frequently and
I was funny when i was doing this nail
polish this color is like on its last
leg I was having to dip the bottle over
just to get polished out so I do use
nail polish a lots i regularly paint my
nails
I I usually paint my nails at least once
a week if not even more I like to change
up the colors because I'm doing videos a
lot and you know photos weren't holding
projects and things like that so I do
paint my nails a lot so even though 850
might seem a little bit more expensive
i'm not sure exactly what the shipping
is for each one either but i believe it
also it does only ship in the u.s. right
now there's a lot of restrictions when
it comes to shipping nail polishes even
if I'm just like I just had a giveaway
with a nail polish as a prize and I had
to let the people know and let them know
that I packed it up really good at the
post office and they had to put a
special label on it because nail polish
was in there because it's considered
hazardous i believe so that's one thing
it is only us right now but i know she
said she was working on getting a
distributor overseas but i think i'm
going to start off with snickerdoodle
see how i like it see how I like the
formula make my decision from there and
maybe purchase it one from this line
again or maybe wait and see when she's
going to come out with her next set of
colors but because I do love nail polish
and because i regularly paint my nails i
think that this would be a good purchase
for me it would be like a smart purchase
for me and then i'd also be able to you
know support one of my favorite
youtubers and you know support a
business owner and a woman business
owner I think that's just so cool and
that's something that I really do like
to support so yeah so KL polished I'm
definitely think that I'm gonna be
purchasing one after the holiday
craziness dies down but of course what
do you guys think about kale polish what
do you think about Kathleen coming out
of hair on brand and you guys gotten any
of her nail polishes and what do you
think about them please leave your
