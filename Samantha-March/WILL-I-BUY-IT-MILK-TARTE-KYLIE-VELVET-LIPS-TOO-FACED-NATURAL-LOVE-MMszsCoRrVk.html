consider my full-time career that is
what I left my desk job for was so I
could be writing full-time this is my

proud of this book it took me two years

here is just really momentous for me and
I'm really really excited about it the
book is called defining her by Samantha
March that is me that is my photo on the

your copy super-proud though it's a big
day for me and I'm really excited and
I've gotten a lot of love and support
from you guys here on Instagram on
snapchat on Twitter and I've just been
so grateful for you it's such a big day
it's a scary day because you know you
share your work with everybody and
people get
review it and it's kind of scary but I'm
just really I'm just really proud I hope
to have another novel out before that
end year my aim is for September but
I'll let you guys know if you don't
follow me on snapchat I'm justa method
at March and I give lots of updates and
I talk about writing and I answer a lot
of your guys's questions too that you

your own book and you need some help in
the process so you can always find me on
snapchat or on Twitter and answer a lot
of questions over there too but defining
her is officially on sale today and I am
so so proud of this book so this will be
linked down below but I wanted to throw
that in there before we start the video
because it's just such an exciting day
so now why don't we go ahead and jump
into the will I buy it
I've been getting a lot of questions on
these milk makeup I pigments I've been
starting to see them more like just
within the past couple days I've been
seeing a more on people's snapchats it's
available on the milk makeup website
it's also available at Sephora
I'll find any links that I kind of leave
them linked down below says they are $24
they're just an eye pigment looks like
they have a lot of different shades
they're very metallic I'll leave a photo
linked down below so this is kind of
difficult for me because like I said
I've been seeing people to talk about it
on their snapchats but I haven't seen
anybody actually put it on their eyes
I've seen people swatch it in videos I
seen people swatch them on there
snapchat but I have yet to see someone
actually put this on their eyes so I can
see what it looks like if anybody knows
of someone who did a video that features
them putting it on their eyes like will
you let me know in the comments so I can
go watch or if you have them and you did
a video let me know because I really
want to see what they look like on the
eyes I just keep seeing swatches of them
so it's $24 for one which basically to
me that means you're spending $24 on
eyeshadow and that's that's difficult
for me it's kind of the same as like the
Stila glitters that they were in the $20
range I'm like okay I'm spending $20 on
one shade that I'm probably not going to
wear on a daily basis like that's what's
really hard for me to spend money on
these types of things because I don't
wear stuff like this on a daily basis if
you do that's fantastic but I don't I'm
much more of like neutrals
like that's just what I prefer to go for
like is it fun to switch it up heck yes
and like special occasions duh but I
just don't get a ton of use out of it so
it's hard for me to spend a lot of money
on something that I'm like I'm not gonna
wear that much but I mean the swatches
they look really pretty but as of right
now I'm just I'm gonna say no mostly
because I don't feel like I've seen
enough reviews on it I haven't seen
anybody put it on their eyes I don't
know if it's actually any good it's
supposed to be really really long
wearing but I don't know I don't know I
want to I want to see I want to see more
about it I want to see the feedback I'm
a big review junkie I love watching
everybody else's reviews the results
some things that I try to get early
because you know I try to make a video
on it or things like that but those are
like few and far between usually and
typically I'm waiting till someone else
is talking about them and then I'm
making my decisions that's just kind of
the way that I roll but I don't know as
of right now I'm saying no this might be
another thing the Sephora vib sale I
believe is happening in April and I'm
like my loves list is piling up because
there's a lot of things that I'm like
yeah I'd like to try that but at 20% off
thank you so much so this might be
another thing that I'm waiting for that
sale for to try it out but let me know
what you guys think down below have you
guys tried them out have you used some
what do you think of them let me know in
the comments down below it snaps about
the new tarte collection so if tarte is
coming out with the make believe in
yourself collection and it's going to
launch on the 15th today well hey look
at that
another fun release so i'm looking at
the trend moon one Instagram so we have
them make believe in yourself I and
cheek palette which is metallic
eyeshadows one matte eyeshadow and a
pearly highlight which is $40 you also
have the spellbound glow rainbow
highlighter which has four pastel shades
for an iridescent glow vintage finish
which is $30 there's also the magic
wands brush set hashtag unicorn by I'm
Evan it's $39 so it's I must be $39 for
the whole set will be available March
15th on their website and then I think I
saw in another one that it was going to
be coming to other places yeah we'll be
on alpha and Sephora at some point but
we don't have all that information yet
if it's if it comes out by the time this
video is in there I'll leave in the
description box remember to always check
the description box I have everything
linked down there and if there's
anything that isn't available yet at the
time that I'm filming I put it in there
when I get that information so so it's a
good spot to check okay
so let's see first off I'll start off by
saying that I'd love to our cosmetics I
purchased from them a lot I typically am
very happy with what I get from them
definitely I mean there's hit-or-miss
products but that's you know with every
brand but overall I really enjoy tart
big fan of the brand so the make believe
in yourself I and cheek palette it's $40
and you get the metallic eyeshadows the
one matte shadow and a pearly highlight
I am I'm kind of interested in this
palette it just looks cool it's like
that circle palette I mean the pictures
will be in here but it's like the circle
palette kind of like their rainforest of
the Seas eyeshadow palettes I think
we're in the circle palettes the
metallic shades look really cool I have
that matte shade then there's like that
shadow in the middle that what they say
is it's supposed to be a highlight shade
yeah highlight in the middle I kind of
wish it wasn't just one matte eyeshadow
I kind of wish there was more of my
eyeshadows but I really like the looks
of the metallic shades they just they
look cool it's almost kind of like about
like a mermaid type of vibe to me that I
get when I look at this palette it's $40
which I mean I don't know I guess I
don't think it's a terrible price
because then when you think about buying
the milk eye pigment for $24 or you
could spend 40 and get a lot of
different eyeshadows I don't know I mean
it's gonna depend on you I'm not a huge
I shadow palette junkie I say it a lot
and I keep buying more eyeshadow
palettes so pretty soon I'm gonna have
to stop saying that I'm not an eyeshadow
palette junkie cuz I think y'all are
turning me into one and YouTube is thank
you thank you so much for turning me
into an eyeshadow palette junkie I think
it's happening guys I don't know I kind
of I'm kind of into it I'm kind of into
it you guys um I might go for this one
let me know what you think in the
comments let me know if you're
interested in it if you'd be interested
in seeing first impression review
tutorial all that good stuff but I'm
interested in it the spellbound a glow
rainbow highlighter for $30 I'm not
getting because I have so
highlights my highlight game is out of
control I fell off the highlights
bandwagon and I am back on so hard I
have somebody new highlights I do not
need any more highlights I told you guys
if I say I need a new highlight you guys
are gonna tell me no because I need you
to hold me accountable but no for the
highlights I just have to money right
now I'm completely overwhelmed and the
magic ones brush set I'm not gonna go
for this it's $39 I just got a lot of
new Sigma brushes if you watch my most
recent haul I picked up a set from Sigma
a single brush they sent me a couple
brushes like I just got a lot of new
makeup brushes and I need to I'm staring
at my makeup brushes right now and I
need to do something because I've
already outgrown I got like some some
storage I go box thing for Christmas
from my mother for makeup brushes and
it's completely full and I think I need
another one like I love buying makeup
brushes - I love makeup brushes because
I use them every day so I can like
justify buying them but oh no no I I
shouldn't I know I shouldn't buy makeup
brushes right now they look really cool
too but like I don't know they don't
they don't look like something that I
like truly need you know what I'm saying
so I think out of everything I'm really
most interested in the eyeshadow palette
so let me know what you guys think I'm
gonna pass on everything else but um I
am curious about getting the eyeshadow
palette so I think I might do that let
me know what you think down in the
comments down below but again everything
will be available March 15th on the
tarte cosmetics website i'll leave any
links that i can find below and if i
have more information about when it will
be available on sephora and also they'll
be linked to the comments down below let
me know what you think of this tart
collection of the packaging of the
products i would love to hear your
thoughts okay you guys so Kylie
cosmetics is coming out with another new
release so guess who's snapchats got
blown up the other day oh my goodness
this time it wasn't one of those things
or eyes away from my phone for a while
and I came back to all of them but I
remember my phone was sitting on the
charger and it kind of like sits sits up
on the charger and my phone I just kept
seeing it flashing and flashing and
flashing I'm like who is snapping me
like so many times in a row like what
are they saying to me and it was just
everybody asking me about the new Kylie
cosmetics release because she is coming
out with new lip kit shades and a new
formula this is her Velvet liquid
lipstick looks like there's gonna be
four shades
harmony dazzle and Rosie it will be
available March 16th at 3:00 p.m. PST on
the Calais Cosmetics website so that
will be Thursday the day after this
video goes up okay Kylie Jenner
described it as a formula that doesn't
dry its pigmented it keeps your lips
moist and the texture of the liquid it
looks the same as the matte liquid
lipstick but the formula doesn't dry it
has a wet feeling on the lips and it is
transferable say how much they are and
usually she does that usually we don't
know the price until like right before
the launch but I think they come with
lip liners so what does she charge for a
lip kit $29 or something like that I can
put it in here I can't remember off the
top of my head but it looks like they're
going to be sold with the liquid
lipstick and the lip liner so it's
actual lip kit not just the singles the
singles are cheaper so right away I know
that I'm not going to buy it because I
don't want to spend that much money on a
look what lipstick in a lip liner
because I don't really wear lip liners a
lot and I have a lot of lip liners for
someone who says she doesn't wear lip
liners a lot that's just how it is so
I'm not gonna buy it because I don't
want a lip liner that I'm not gonna use
and I don't want to spend the extra
money I would rather just spend I think
her single liquid lipsticks are like
seventeen dollars which i think is a
very competitive price so I don't need a
lip kit I have not purchased some Kylie
cosmetics in a really long time and I
just don't feel the urge to and I don't
know I I don't know
my problem with cata cosmetics and I've
said it in the past is that her products
to me are very I don't know what they're
gonna be like I bought a liquid lipstick
I absolutely loved it a few months later
I bought another liquid lipstick and I
hated it and it's just constantly
changing and there's always some sort of
issue with something and it just makes
me not want to buy it and the prices can
be a little bit more expensive like the
single like what lipstick is not bad to
me but a lip kit is expensive to me and
if I don't love it I can't return it to
Kylie cosmetics which sucks because you
guys know like I do return makeup to
support and also if I don't like it so
because I know that I would just be
stuck with a lipstick if I don't love it
makes me not want to do it and I don't
know I just I don't feel the pull for
Kylie cosmetics like I feel some people
do or just
I just don't I haven't purchased from
her in a really really long time and I'm
not saying that I'm not going to in the
future or when I recommend the brand or
anything like that it's just my personal
decision nothing really screams out to
me
maybe if she came out with something
that like really made my head turn I
would think about it but also like I
like liquid lipsticks that dry and that
don't transfer it's like that is what I
like to wear and that's what I wear out
most of the time I don't go for my
liquid lipsticks a lot that don't dry
down matte like do I still like them
yeah and do I wear them sure but I reach
for the ones that are completely dried
down more that's just my preference so
there's just really nothing about this
new release that screens out to me so
I'm gonna pass over this one but let me
know what you guys think in the comments
down below if you're gonna be getting it
if you're excited for this release if
you buy everything that Kylie comes out
with that's very cool no judgments on
here these feel like my videos are all
about no judgement you buy what you want
to buy I'll buy what I want to buy we
won't buy what we won't want to buy and
everyone wins I think that's what I
think but let me know what you think
about Kylie's new release in the
comments down below alright guys the
final item that I have to talk about you
guys know I was going to talk about it
this has probably been even more
requested than the new Kylie lipsticks
in all honesty I think this one would
has been requested more and for a longer
period of time because it's all we've
been hearing about lately obviously I'm
talking about the new palette from Too
Faced cosmetics they are coming out with
the natural love palette we've been
hearing about this palette for so long
so I feel like it's been asked so often
to put in the will I buy at videos and I
was trying to wait until I had a full
picture that I could see that I had
swatches at editorial and all that good
stuff so I could give it a good like
honest will I buy an opinion so the
natural buff palette and includes 30
shades
it's $59 it's a limited edition it's a
mix of new shades and shades from
existing palettes 30 shades that's a
pretty big palette I don't like that
limited edition I don't like that
there's only some new shades and some
are from existing palettes because like
what if you get it and then like the
shades that you really like are from
your existing palette and you already
own it that would suck
um I'm not gonna get this because it
doesn't it doesn't do anything for me it
doesn't speak to me it doesn't like
whisper my name at night so that's how I
know when I don't need makeup and I
don't need to convince myself to buy
makeup I've said that in a lot of will i
buy it videos if something doesn't call
out to me right away I don't need to
convince myself to get it because
there's so many makeup releases and
there's things that I'm actually like
more interested in $59 is pretty
expensive for a palette especially that
you're not even getting like all new
shades thank you no limitation I try not
to buy a lot of limited edition because
people get very angry if they can't get
it or the release is like totally wonky
like most two phases releases are and
they can't get it and they get upset
about it I don't like limited edition
but really the biggest thing it doesn't
do anything for me and I don't know Too
Faced has to come out with something
that like really gets me going in order
for me to purchase from them I just I've
been not having the greatest experiences
with them obviously hashtag white
chocolate chip palette we know the
debacle there already I'm seeing people
get it and people are not being happy
with it
people are not liking the shades in
there that they're saying they don't
work well like that's already the
initial feedback someone just comment on
one of my videos and said she's already
thinking of returning it I'm like that's
wild so I just don't love to face right
now I've said in one of my videos that
were we're in a complicated relationship
and I just I feel like they need to put
out something that like really catches
my eye and really makes me like whoa
that's cool
or just something to get me excited
again for me to purchase from them but I
just I just don't feel a need to right
now and you know I'm not trying to like
sit up here and like bash two-faced
because I still do like them I have the
sweet peach palette on my eyes today I
still like them but they're just not
putting out stuff that I like it's
making me really excited and I kind of
lost some trust in them so I'm just not
doing it right now but I'm sure a time
people are gonna buy this palace oh
that's fantastic
in their collection they are also
releasing highlighters I have talked
about the highlights and another will I
buy it so I'll leave that link down
below they're also coming out with some
lip shades but I'm not gonna buy them
either I just I don't feel like I need
them and I have so many lipsticks I need
to do a lipstick declutter like a is
habit
life its redonkulous how many lipsticks
I currently own seriously I don't need
any so but the big thing that I want to
talk about was the palette because I
didn't ask so much about it but it just
it doesn't interest me enough and then
there's all those other comments about
it that it's just not gonna be for me
but let me know in the comments down
below is it going to be for you are you
excited about it have you already
purchased it I believe it is already
