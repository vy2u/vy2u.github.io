today's video is going to be a new will
I buy a video I post my bail advice
every single Wednesday talking about
some new makeup releases and lunches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then letting you know if I am
planning to pick them up or pass over
them I have less a sock vibe to this
week so why don't we go ahead and get
started
all right so today's video is actually
going to feature all holiday makeup
releases I had been doing it these
separately continuing to do like regular
makeup releases on Wednesdays and then I
was doing holiday makeup releases like
every two weeks or so typically on a
Sunday but there is just so much holiday
right now you know it's as we're getting
closer and closer to actual holiday time
more and more releases are coming out so
I'm just going to go ahead and dedicate
today this video to all holiday releases
I also have so many other videos to post
I just do not have time to do another
type of will I buy a video featuring the
holiday ones so that's what we're gonna
do today all holiday releases so the
first one I want to talk about is from
Make Up For Ever they are releasing the
illustrious blush palette it's limited
edition as most holiday releases are it
has a twelve shades inside so it's one
hundred and fifty dollars and the value
was two hundred and ninety dollars it
has highlighting powders in there blush
powders and also the face of sculpting
powders so twelve shades one hundred and
fifty dollars that's expensive when I
first saw this on the tournament website
I will have her Instagram link down
below me as I often am reading from her
Instagram when I first saw it I was like
yes I want this I'm gonna get it I did
the double take I was like oh I'm gonna
add a to my car because I'm gonna shop
the IB Rouge part too yes and then I saw
$150 and I was like oh oh that's just
gonna be a little bit too expensive for
me for a face palette I have a huge love
her face palettes I love to buy them I
love to use them I love to travel with
them I really enjoy face palettes but I
did just recently by the Becca cosmetics
face palette that has blush bronzer and
highlight in there I have several other
face palettes that I really really love
and I think it's just going to come down
to one hundred and fifty dollars as too
much money for me to spend on a limited
edition palette I also did
we purchase two I think both shades are
included in this palette when I did my
trying to subscribers favorite makeup I
actually had people recommended the
individual face powder is a from Make Up
For Ever so I did pick up a contour
shade and I did pick up a blush shade
and I believe both of those shades are
in this palette so it's kind of like mmm
okay probably not
but I'm super bummed because I like
those like I like my contour shade I
like my blush shade but already having
two of the shades in here it's limited
edition it's also $150 I'm like no girl
you can't do it not for you not right
now I just put the big Sephora VIP sale
order I'm probably like I said I'm going
to do it again when Rouge gets to shop
again starting on Friday I believe it is
probably gonna place another order and
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this one
out hurts me to say because I love my
face palettes but this one's gonna be a
no-go for me I said I was giving a lot
of tags on another new how they released
from Becca cosmetics Becca is busy busy
busy this holiday season so they are
coming out with the light waves
highlighter palette it is $34 it
includes the shades moonstone pink
sapphire which is a new shade and then
prismatic amethyst it is of course
limited edition as most holiday releases
are okay so the packaging is really
pretty on this one it has the three
different highlight shades I actually
did want a prismatic amethyst when every
at least that was one that caught my
attention for some reason and I just
never went ahead and purchased it so
when I solved this one come out I was
like hmm should I get that one but like
I mentioned previously I did just
purchase at the Becca appraise glow face
palette and that was $54 so that was a
pretty pricey palette to pick up and it
has the different highlighter shades in
there and also has the brother and the
blush so I'm like I just don't think I
would need another new like a cosmetics
palette to add to me right now but I'm
just having the best time with the
appraised geek glow palette that I'm
like why would I need to add in another
one and especially just a highlight
palette I lately more and more I'm
seeing myself gravitate towards the face
palace versus just of the highlight
palettes though they're just when I'm
reaching for more
and I just feel like I'm kind of getting
more bang for my buck if that makes
sense I'm instead of just doing the
highlight palette because typically when
I reach for the highlight palette and
only reaching for one shade maybe I'm
mixing them but I like reaching for a
face palette because I like being able
to do multiple steps for my makeup with
the face palette versus just the
highlight palette I mention one of my
past videos even like I was deciding
between the Anastacio sugar glow kit MD
Becca face palette and I went with the
Becca because it had more shades even
though it was more expensive by like $14
I think it was it had more shades versus
just the highlight palette so I'm just
not totally gravitating towards
highlight palette slightly I'd rather
than be in a face palette but $34 for
the three highlights I guess I don't
think that's a terrible price for
Rebecca so if those three shades really
catch your attention the packaging looks
nice and it does look like it has a
mirror I don't think it would be a bad
purchase but I just don't think I need
it right now I got a lot of tags on this
one too and I was really excited to see
this this is a some new holiday releases
from a dose of colors they are coming
out with a liquid lipsticks sets they're
going to be $29 each there's Halle Bay
which has strawberries pop bittersweet
and extra saucy and then the other set
is the Snuggle is real with a warm and
fuzzy let's cuddle and lazy Daisy
so the snuggle is real is more of a nude
set and then Halle Bay is more like the
red and it looks like one is maybe like
a brighter pink the strawberry pop is a
bit of a brighter pink alright I am so
excited for this I love the dose of
colors a liquid lipstick formula I think
I have I want to say it's either like
three or four of the dose of colors
liquid lipsticks I was super bummed
because they weren't on sale for like
50% off maybe during the auto 21 days of
beauty and that was like my thing like I
was like out of everything that's going
for sale I'm most excited about the dose
of colors liquid lipsticks and they sold
out within like 15 minutes of the sale
going life and I was like neat so I was
really really stoked to see these I
definitely want to pick up the nude set
I don't think I would go with the red
set just because I don't think I would
get
as much use out of them you guys know
like nudes and my things I actually have
a nude lipstick on before this and I was
like no girl you're talking holiday
you got your glitter on you got your
holiday dress on this was actually
technically a dress like put your red
lip on and be holiday I definitely want
to pick up the Smiggle is real I think
all of the shades looks so pretty and I
like that they're all like different
enough sometimes what a nude set
especially they can kind of all look
very similar but I feel like all three
are very different so I'm excited I love
that formula and dose of colors is now
at Ulta so this will be available in
November 10th at 10:00 a.m. at dose of
colors and then it also will be going
available at Ulta and Amy's so I'm
planning to pick my table from Ulta let
us know what you think about these at
dose of colors a liquid lipstick sets
are you into get the nude the red both
neither mmm let us know so lastly I'm
going to talk about more feed they
release a pretty large holiday
collection and the tag has been coming
in Fast and Furious on this one all
righty here let's see so they are
releasing the dare to create collection
it includes peopling it on brush set
which is a $79 they're very like blingy
brushes of course like the name of the
state dare to create to the 39a
eyeshadow palette 39 shades for $32 the
15 d-day slayer it's $15 it has 15
shades 15 and night master $15 15 sheets
paint the town liquid lipsticks trios
and nude in red 12 dollars for each trio
which are smaller sizes and then the
daring metallic liquid lipstick in five
shades $12 each regular sized okay so to
jump into the collection so first off
the daring metallic liquid lipstick in
the five different shades for $12
I would not be getting that I'm not a
metallic lipstick lover I would not need
that paint the town liquid lipstick
trios and nude and red for $12 each trio
I'm also going to be passing over that I
just bought a set of huda beauty liquid
lipsticks during the Sephora vib sale
like I said I want to purchase the dose
of colors look whit lips egg
trio as well so I just don't need more I
do like the more if you like what
lipsticks but just the thing of where I
don't need them let's see here the bling
it on a brush
for $79 I mean it looks like you get
some nice brushes I do like the morphe
brushes I have quite a few of them and I
do like them
I don't need my brushes to be like
blinged out and sparkly I get it it's
super fun and it would like look really
cute but that's not something that like
necessarily draws me to a brush
I heard that Babs Beauty I was watching
her snap review of them and she said not
only you know of course are they really
pretty what she said they are actually
functional brushes but if sometimes you
don't get it like the packaging is too
over-the-top or like the you know
aesthetics of it is too over-the-top but
she said they are functional but I
simply don't need brushes especially a
set for $79 I have a ton of makeup
brushes I've done a makeup brush
declutter not that long ago and then I
just keep buying brushes because it's
like a sickness I have I don't know how
to cure myself of that but I have a ton
of makeup brushes I definitely don't
need another one especially for a higher
price to set and then let's see so we
have the eyeshadow palettes to chat
about so the thirty nine eight thirty
nine shades $32 this one is interesting
because the middle row and the palette
is all like bigger shades and when I
first saw this I was like are those like
face shades like for some reason I
thought it was actually like an
eyeshadow and face palette and like I
thought the middle row was like contour
and bronzer and blushes like things like
that and then when I actually looked
closer their eyeshadow shades but those
are all supposed to be transition shades
for like every skin tone I think the
concept of that is very interesting
don't get me wrong I think that's super
interesting but I don't feel like I need
really any of these three morphe shadows
the big one and then the two smaller 15
ones because I just got the you know the
Jacqueline Hill morphe palette just
launched not that long ago just a couple
months ago and I'm really happy with
that one and then the three 5:02 just
launched like was that even a month ago
maybe I don't remember but I loved that
palette and I'm super happy with it and
one of the shades in here I can't tell
which one is I must be the 15 D the day
Slayer has like a lot of like the Browns
and oranges I mean that one reminds me
of like to me it looks like a mini 3 500
or 3 502 so it's like mmm I wouldn't
need that the other one does have like
the darker shades in there but
I'm like some of those darker shades are
on the 3502 and if they're not they're
probably in the Jacqueline Hill palette
and if they're not I probably have at
least one other eyeshadow palette that
has so shades just one though not
multiple so I just I just feel like I
don't need this with all of the new
releases that morphe is coming out with
when I saw like this big old Holiday
Collection which I understand like a lot
of companies are doing this they're
coming out with their regular items in
they're coming out with holiday
collections on top of it but I'm almost
like I'm feeling color popped you know
like you're you're putting too much out
for me I can't keep up it's overwhelming
me and what happens when I talk about
color pop allies like they put out too
much and it's just it's just too much
for me I'm like no no no back off back
off like I can't I can't keep up so
that's kind of how I feel with more free
right now like we just got these two
really amazing eyeshadow palettes Hills
palette they're some of my favorites I'm
recommending them everywhere that I can
but I'm kind of like I'm still using
those palettes and creating new looks
with them and getting excited for them
it's like it's too soon for me to be
bringing in other eyeshadow palettes so
I mean they look pretty but again if you
did get the three 5:02 I don't think
that you would need the 15 D I hear this
the formulas and these are supposed to
be like exactly like the Jackson Hale
and 3 502 so I don't feel like you would
need the the 15 d and then again the 15
n like I just I don't know maybe if you
want to try morphe if you haven't tried
their eyeshadow palettes yet and you
want to try more of these like mini
palettes for a lesser money you know $15
isn't bad you know I totally get it but
for me I don't feel like I need it with
with all the other eye shadow palettes
that I have from morphine but I just
recently got from morphe and still want
to be planning with so for me when I saw
the collection I just couldn't get
excited for it because I'm still too
excited about my other palettes so I'm
gonna keep playing with them and you
know try not to over buy as much as I
can I'm not a hundred percent if this is
going to be available at Ulta morphe is
recently now at Ulta not sure if this
one will be in here but you can get it
on the morphe website I believe it is
available in that I can get launched on
the day before this video goes live for
