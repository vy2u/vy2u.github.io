today's video is going to be a will I
buy it so I post my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I talk
about typically new makeup releases or
product launches or just things that
we're getting excited about in the
makeup world I talk about whether I am
going to purchase them or not
I started this series a while back just
as a way to be able to talk about some
of the new releases or exciting releases
without being able to purchase them
myself so it's just kind of a fun way to
hang out with you guys for a little bit
talk about new makeup talk about what I
think about them and let you guys know
if I'm gonna part with my hard-earned
money or not for these releases so I
guess I do post these every Wednesday
I'll leave my playlist link down below I
also post on Thursday's Sundays and
Monday so I post four times a week so I
hope that you will hit the subscribe
button that so you become part of the
fam and get notified when I post all my
videos but if you would like to see what
I'm chatting about in this week's will I
buy it please keep watching okay so a
lot of people were tagging me on
Instagram as I was sitting down to film
this video another tech just came
through for a lot of you guys are
wanting me to talk about the new morphe
liquid lipsticks so I believe this is
the first time that Murphy is coming out
with the liquid lipsticks so they are
$12.99 a piece they are already on sale
so I'll leave them linked down below
so there are 22 different shades and
like I said $12.99 they are matte liquid
lipsticks they have a huge range of
colors from the nudes and the mob's and
the reds and the pinks and then the
vampire color is the Browns and the
really deep blues and that sort of thing
so okay so have you guys been asking me
about these and I am so so super curious
about them because I am a lipstick
junkie I talk about am I will i buy
videos that I'm not necessarily like and
eyeshadow palette junkie or even like a
blush junkie but I have a weakness for
lipsticks especially liquid lipsticks so
these ones I have been agging I am
watching those videos that are coming
out with everyone's doing swatches like
those the influencers that were sent to
the entire collection and they're doing
the lip swatches I have a list written
out because I would like to pick me up
some of these $12.99
it's not the most expensive liquid
lipstick it's definitely I feel like on
the pricier side four more feet I don't
know I guess I thought maybe they would
be a little bit more inexpensive because
morphe is known for being more
affordable so i don't know i was just
thinking like $12.99 like a Nastasia
it's 20 cap on B is 20 but like for
Kylie cosmetics to get a single look
what lipstick for her is seventeen and
and then I was thinking of like the wet
and wild lipsticks that just came out
from the drugstore those are $4.99 so I
don't know I was thinking maybe it would
be like $9.99 maybe so
$12.99 was a little bit more than I was
expecting so I might just grab like two
or three different shades to be able to
test them out the three that I have on
my list that I want to try our vanity
brunch and peanut those are the ones
that I have written down but I would
like to place an order with Murphy I've
been meaning to place an order with them
for a while but you have to do with the
$100 to get the free shipping and I
don't know why that's such like an
important thing to me but I'm like nope
I have to do it so I get my cart ready
but then by the time I'm ready to check
out something's not in stock anymore and
then I'm like oh just forget about it
just forget about it so I don't know
we'll see but I do have some of my
favorite shades written down and I saw
that they just came out like new Beauty
blenders so I'm thinking about doing
that I was trying to see if the 25a or B
palettes we're gonna come back and stock
anytime soon so maybe I could throw
those in my cart too because I was super
bummed that I missed out on that launch
and that they sold out so fast but the
morphine liquid lipsticks I definitely
would like to get my hands on some and
test out the formula for myself and see
what I think let us know in the comments
down below have you guys already gotten
these they have already been for sale I
don't think it's been quite a week yet
as I'm filming but curious if any of you
guys have been able to try it out and
what you think of the formula okay so
this one you guys have just started
taking me on it so I think this is kind
of like newer news but this is a new
release from Oprah cosmetics and is the
on the glow palette so I'm looking at
the tread moon one Instagram it is six
full-size highlighters in bronzers all
permanent in one palette it'll be
available on January 24th so it went on
sale yesterday
and it'll be available on the website
from over cosmetics and the regular
price is a hundred and forty nine
dollars or $17 per shade okay so I
haven't really been able to look at this
one too closely because it was just like
hours before I sat down to film this
video that I saw the tags coming in and
I haven't seen this yet so I'll insert a
photo down here of what the palette
looks like I mean it looks gorgeous so
you get six full-size highlighters and
bronzers that's great but a hundred and
forty nine dollars that is really that's
that's pricey and I know they're saying
they're breaking it down and it's $17
per shade which I guess is a little bit
better but then I think about the
anasazi of glow kits that you spend $40
on you get four shades so then if you
break that down like I don't know guys
that just seems a little bit too
expensive for me I actually have never
tried Oprah's highlighters or bronzers I
have a liquid lipstick from them but I
think that's the only thing from Oprah
that I own so I'm not super familiar
like I know the brand and I think it's
very popular like instagram / youtube
brand but I've never purchased from them
myself it was a brand I didn't hear
about until I got on YouTube and
Instagram so I've never purchased from
them I know that there's a lot of
different discount codes out there like
the trend would Instagram was saying
that she has a 30% discount so I think
that's like morphe where morphe you
usually I think it's the 10% discount
code that a lot of influencers have I
think Oprah is 30 which that's good but
I think what the discount was still
gonna be like 104 dollars maybe or
something like that for the six shades
so for me that's just too much money to
spend on highlighters I do talk about in
some of my will I buy up videos that if
I'm gonna be spending more money than I
want to be spending that I like to spend
that on items that I'm gonna use on a
pretty regular basis like you know not
even like in everyday basis but it's
going to be something that I use very
frequently and for me highlighters is
not the case looking at the photo again
it looks mostly like a highlight palette
like I see the couple of bran shades in
there but like for me what draws my
attention is the highlight shades and I
don't wear highlight every day I'm not
wearing highlight
right now it's just not something that I
wear on a daily basis so I think it's
just going to be too much money for me
to be able to justify spending that
amount of money on a highlight palette
so for me the Africa's medics on the
global palate I'm gonna go ahead and
pass over it but let us know what do you
guys have from Oprah what do you love
what you absolutely recommend or what do
you suggest staying away from and of
course let us know if you're gonna pick
up this palette as well was also giving
us some questions about a new release
from the balm cosmetics this is the
highlight in contour palette and the
spelling of it is is kind of funny with
contour because I guess the palette is
like musical themed or like music
festival type of themed which I thought
was really funny so it's a highlighting
contour palette it comes with two
shimmery highlighters two Mac
highlighters to contour powders a
bronzer and a blush and it was all for
$36 so I of course will leave the photo
in here and it looks super cute I love
like the music festival theme I think
that's a really cool idea and that's the
palette it looks really cute I don't
have a Tana from the balm cosmetics I'm
pretty sure the only thing I have is the
mary lou manizer highlight which I love
the highlight it's one of my favorites
it was actually the first highlight that
I've ever purchased for myself so that
will always have a special place for me
but other than that I don't think I have
anything else from the balm but they're
definitely a brand that I would like to
try more and and have more from and I
know this one has kind of given me a
couple of double takes like I keep
looking at it like the highlights look
pretty I like that the bronzer shades
are in there I like that there's a blush
in there as well but I don't know cuz it
says like the to shimmer highlights and
then the two matte highlights and I'm
not sure um a super huge fan or even
really understand a matte highlight
shade I don't know about that so I'm not
sure I would love them and then the
contour power is the bronzer there's two
shades in there that I feel like look
too deep for me like I'm not totally
positive I'd be able to get a lot out of
those the blush looks really pretty it's
a really deeper type of berry looking
blush which I don't have a lot of though
so I thought maybe I could get along
with that but
I don't know just looking at it again
and feeling like I feel like there's
gonna be certain shades I need to pick
and choose out of it
I don't know if it would make the most
sense to get for being $36 I feel like
I'd really want to make sure that I'm
gonna be using at least the majority of
the shades and I feel like I would use
one contour shade the blush and then you
know maybe like a highlight shade and
that's probably not enough for me to be
able to justify spending the $36 on it
it looks so cute though
I totally dig the concept and I think it
looks like a lot of fun but I think for
just practicality reasons that I'm gonna
have to skip over this one I've said it
in my other clients that I posted in
January that you know it's the it's the
new year it's January we're thinking you
know we got all these goals and what
we're gonna achieve this year and I'm
still definitely on the like make
smarter makeup purchases cut type of
train so I'm definitely trying to I'm
being much more thoughtful I guess maybe
about what it is I'm purchasing and
where I'm putting my money and and all
that jazz so trying my best to be as
practical as I can and I don't think
this one would be a smart purchase for
me so I'm gonna skip over the highlight
and contour palette from the balm
cosmetics but of course as always let us
know in the comments down below if
you've got this palette or if you think
that you will still pick it up okay the
last one that I want to talk about is
the brow collection from Maybelline so I
had someone on my snapchat asked if I
would talk about this collection so I
think there are some quite a few new
products that Maybelline is putting out
like the drugstores really come out as
really hard right now look really hard I
just made a purchase my first makeup
purchase of 2017 for a like testing out
drugstore makeup and review video that
was voted on in my latest Twitter poll
so that video will be coming soon where
I'm trying out a lot of new drugstore
makeup and giving you guys my feedback
absolutely because yeah the the
drugstore is going going a little crazy
right now with their new releases so
someone snapped me a picture of the
entire like Maybelline brow collection
and asked if I would talk about it so
just looking at the photo here and I'll
insert it down here as well they have a
brow drama Pro palette they have the
brow
drama like sculpting gel they have
pencils they have Korean pomades feel
that they have like a new like
highlighter stick type of thing for
under the brow kind of like a high brow
from benefit type of thing so they have
a lot going on so I thought I thought I
would touch on this real quick I look
because I was asked about it but I
thought it was interesting too and I
also wanted to get your guys's feedback
as well if anybody has this kind of
stuff because you might know if you're
not new to my channel then I'm not super
great at eyebrows and I don't really
have a huge eyebrow game and I get
called out a lot for it and that's
totally fine like I'm I'm okay if that's
what you decide to come at me with but
uh I know that I don't have a strong
brow game so I wanted to ask if and you
guys have any of these products from
Maybelline whether it be the new
releases or some of their past releases
I actually do have the Maybelline brow
drama and it's what I have in my brows
right now I actually wasn't going to
film tonight I was just gonna do a quick
like drugstore makeup easy look for an
Instagram tutorial and then I was like
hey why don't I just hop on camera and
film this well I've had it so I I just
put some of the Maybelline brow drama
through my eyebrows it's not like a
fiber type of gel like the Gimme brow
from benefit it's just kind of like a
tinted gel that kind of like can give
the illusion of more filled in brows and
just like better sculpted brows but I
saw that they are coming out with I
think it's called the brow yeah the brow
precise which is has the fibers in it so
more like the gimme brow I actually did
just purchase that in my Ulta purchase
that I did because I wanted to do
something eyebrow as well there was a
couple different options that I could do
that were new at the drugstore but I
really do like the Maybelline as a brand
I have a lot from them they're probably
like my top two brands at the drugstore
so I decided to go with them and see how
they're fiber
brow product compares against the
benefit gimme brow so I'm excited I will
be doing that review soon but that was
the only brow product that I picked up I
thought about doing the cran pomade
because when I'm watching the Maybelline
snapchats the gala that's on there she
always says the pomade is good for
beginners like the cran pomade
and I'm always like really because I
can't figure it out like it looks weird
to me like I would rather use a pencil
because I don't understand what it is
they're doing and how they're not just
making like huge crazy eyebrows on
themselves so I don't know has anyone
tried that because I'm very curious
about it um the broad drama I do have
and then they have the couple of like
the pro palettes and such honestly I
don't think I would get them I don't eat
the powder highlights a lot I just had
to skip over the pencils and just go
right for the fibers because a lot of
times that's easier for me like I don't
have to deal with a pencil or a spoolie
or anything I just run some of the gimme
brow through my brows and call it a day
so I'm excited to have a drugstore
version of it I also thought about
getting the highlight stick and then I
didn't and then I was kind of mad at
myself but that's okay I think I'm good
starting off where I started off so I'm
just thinking about the new Maybelline
eyebrow collection things that they have
going on there was definitely quite a
few products that intrigued me and I did
decide to make a purchase for their brow
precise so you'll be seeing that in
upcoming videos and reviews soon so I'm
really excited about it but yeah I
wanted to touch them that one I know as
a collection I didn't want to spend a
ton of time on it I'm trying to cut down
this Villa by it's as best as I can but
yeah it looks like a really cool
collection that Maybelline is coming up
with and not even just their brows up
but they're coming out with a lot of new
stuff i know people are excited about
they have a cushion foundation coming
out new mascaras coming out concealer
six i mean they just have a lot going on
right now so let us know in the comments

from their brow collection or just
