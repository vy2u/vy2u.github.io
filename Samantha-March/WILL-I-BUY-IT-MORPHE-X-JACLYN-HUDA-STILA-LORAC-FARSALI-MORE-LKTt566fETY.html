today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my bullabbai videos
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting over some new makeup releases
letting you know a little bit about them
and then also my thoughts on them and if
I'm saying to pick them up or pass over
them and I have a lot to talk about this
week so let's go ahead and get started
hey so last week I was actually pre
filming pretty far in advance for last
week so if I video Kasab's out of town
for a couple days so it was kind of a
shortened video and I even said in there
I was like I'm sure something's gonna
release over the weekend because
normally I film news on Monday like I
just know something's gonna release over
the weekend and it's not gonna be in
this week's video but I promise will be
in next week's on of course it was the
Jaclyn hill and morphe new collection
that they're doing I even it came out
still while I was editing the video and
I even put a little clip in there like
this is what happened this is what I'm
missing of this week still about video
but I promise I'll talk about it next
week so I do want to kick it off talking
about that collection now I actually did
end up receiving the collection in PR
which first I just I don't know how to
explain my thoughts on getting PR and
like what I expected what I don't expect
because the short answer is is that I
just don't expect anything and I don't
consider myself on a brand's PR list
which if I think about it sometimes
sounds weird because there's definitely
some brands that you send me aloud or
send me like almost what I think is like
all of their PR but I'm still like no
I'm not on there beautiful is like
that's kind of way that my mind works
and especially with morphe and then
Jaclyn hill is obviously a huge youtuber
and the success of their original Jaclyn
hill palette that came out and how
excited people were over this one I was
like yeah no I'm definitely not getting
that one and it was something that never
even crossed my mind that I might get
until I was watching Jacqueline's
snapchats and she was shown the PR
package and she was like oh and it's
going out to everybody on the PR list
tomorrow and I was like am I on the PR
list and I was like no no I'm not gonna
send you that girl and I just went
bawling my merry way and really was not
expect
I worked so hard Monday's video that
went up was my first impressions on all
four of the pallets I did a look with
all four of the pallets I really wanted
to get it up right away
so I did film that so I'll have that
video linked down below if you want to
see a look with each of the four pallets
I also do have a ring the alarm on today
which is more like the warm-toned like
orange e red pallet I have that on my
eyes today because I will be filming an
actual review video on everything also
since that was a first impression the
first time I was putting any of the
pallets onto my eyes so I did want to
say that but I still wanted to talk
about in the will I buy a video because
I was planning on it anyways and like I
said I really wasn't expecting to get it
in PR and so I wanted to talk about what
I was thinking as you know a consumer
like yes I'm a youtuber but also as a
consumer and what I was what I was
planning on getting so I'm kind of the
first thing that I thought of is I
really really thought that this was her
brand Blanche I really really did and I
was excited for it I think Jacqueline
Hill has been talking about her own
brand and her own cosmetics line since I
started watching YouTube which has been
for a couple of years now I think I've
always heard you know she's coming out
with something she's working on her own
brand and when I saw her you know
starting to swatch on on snapchat and
such I was like this is it this is it I
like I know it I know this is a brand
launch and you know a lot of people have
been really excited about it Jaclyn has
over five million YouTube subscribers I
think it is she was the second -
youtuber I started watching and pressure
went karlie Jaclyn casing homes I
believe this is the order that I start
watching youtubers and you know so many
people are very excited for her own
brand and you know obviously
Jacqueline's gone through some personal
things as of lately and I think people
were like yes like this is how you do it
this is how you bounce back from
everything that's going on and so when I
saw it was another collaboration with
more with Murphy like I won't lie I was
kind of like I really wanted to see your
own brand and see like everything that
you're going to be doing in what you've
been working for so many years on like I
was really really excited for that so I
don't want to say that I was like
disappointed that it was more for you
because at the same time I love the
morphe jaclyn hill palette it's one of
my favorite palettes
my most used pallets I put that pallet
in my if I could only keep one tag video
because I love that pallet so much so it
wasn't that I was like but I was kind of
like mmm you know like there's a
difference
like did you catch did you catch the
difference need me do it again you can
rewind it if you want a YouTube video
but so that was kind of like my very
very first initial thought but then at
the same time I was like okay I love the
pallet that she did with morphe the 35
palette that Jaclyn hill palette I love
that one I think it's great quality I
love the colors in there so I then then
I was like okay I'm still excited I'm
still excited for it and then when she
broke down and we saw the four different
palettes I was like whoo yes because
don't get me wrong
I love the John Hill palette I love how
big it is I love how you know it's kind
of one of the reasons I put it in that
tank video it's because there's so many
different color combinations in there if
I'm gonna keep one palette for the rest
of my life I can do a lot of different
looks out of that palette but at the
same time I am someone who gravitates
towards smaller palettes i am i love the
dose of colors v pantalets those are
some of my favorites I like smaller
palettes that have more of a theme with
them because I say a lot I'm not
artistically creative like my mind
doesn't work that way like I can see a
photo and get excited but my mind
doesn't quite snap on like that
and so when I have a smaller palette
that's more of a theme I can look at it
easier and be like this is what I'm
doing today it's not me staring at the
palette for 40 minutes like how does one
do makeup you know so when I saw that I
thought that was really really cool and
then when Jacqueline did put out her
video and I was watching it I was
actually very impressed by kind of
everything that went into the collection
I really was um between like the
different themes of the palettes and I
really liked the four different like
distinct different themes in there from
the color coordination to the I have one
of the palettes right here ring the
alarm so this is like the red palette so
ring the alarm is in red here on the
side and it also has these red dots on
the front that's such a small detail but
honestly because I do have all four
pallets I just have them stacked on my
desk right now and it is easy I needed a
shade name the other day for something
that I was
typing and I was able to look at the
four pellets and even though the
packaging is the same I could see ring
the alarm wasn't read and I was like
okay that's the one that I need that
 like it's such a small thing but it
actually made me like it makes sense to
me and I I do appreciate that I
appreciate the fact that we have these
mirrors here I appreciate that the shade
names are on there like I think I think
they did take what people were saying
about the first pallet and putting that
into these other four pallets and I
appreciate all of that so I thought that
was really cool so the pricing on them
you can get the bundle for $49 so it's
four pallets from $49 or you can
purchase them individually for $15 so if
you purchase them as a bundle I think
it's like 12 it's like 12 25 or
something like that per pallet if you
were to break it down that way they'll
be available June 26 on the morphe
website I'm not sure if they're coming
to Ulta and I'm not sure if they're
limited edition I haven't seen that
anywhere yet when I was thinking about
that I'm thinking price-wise I was like
you know what I'm probably just gonna go
ahead and pick up all four I kind of
like a sucker for a deal and all that
and then also at the same time I'm
thinking with my youtuber mind like it'd
be really awesome to be able to create a
video like I did on Monday you know
doing the looks on all the pallets so I
was already gravitating towards
purchasing all of these I didn't think
it was a bad price and I was excited for
the smaller pallets that's it's
something that's more what I like to put
into my makeup collection versus really
big pallets so I was like oh my gosh I'm
so excited say the one that I was most
excited for was the purple palette which
is called bling boss which is this one
right here this was the one that I was
so hyped about because I love Purple's I
love for both green eyes I love pinks
and purples as of this moment so this
was the number one that I knew for sure
I was getting and then the other one
that I was like I really really want
that one is armed and gorgeous this one
is more of the yellow and I'm also
really into yellows right now I've been
wearing yellow a lot lately and they
have these beautiful goals in here too
which I'm really attracted to cold and
then also some really nice warm tones
which is my vibe as well so these were
the top two palettes that I was
considering getting and then I was like
well you know with ringing the alarm
which is this one right here which is
warm-toned I was like these are the most
view shades that I grabbed from the bank
morphe jaclyn hill palette why not have
a small palette where you know if I'm
going traveling or maybe I'm just going
somewhere for a night I can just grab
this small one I'll have my mirror in it
and I'll be able to get my warm smoky
eye that I love doing and that's like
one of my fallback makeup looks why not
have a small one and then at that point
it was like why not just got the fourth
palette this one is called dark magic
these colors kind of intimidate me
they're darker they're harder to work
with you know I'm not a makeup artist so
I know looking at this that it won't be
my most used palette but at the same
time I was like I'm probably just gonna
get it anyways so I was a little bit
between getting these three and not
purchasing dark magic or just getting
all four and getting the bundle price
but that is where I was at with the
morphe and Jaclyn hill collection I was
excited for it
I I liked morphe eyeshadows I've been
purchasing for more fee for a very long
time I've never really gotten into like
the drama of morphe or anything like
that it's never really been nice like I
just don't really care like I like their
products I like their brushes I like
their makeup and up and buying for them
since I started watching YouTube so end
of the day of what I thought about the
four pallets was that I was at least
planning to purchase those three was
probably gonna go ahead and purchase the
fourth one as well so that was kind of
my thoughts on the collection I know I
got it and I've already done a video on
it but I still really wanted to include
it in my will abaya video so that's what
I think about that and then moving on oh
my goodness okay so moving on I got so
many texts on this one and I could not
figure out what it was at first so this
is from Madonna she has a skincare line
called like I want to say it's called
Madonna skin it's MD and a skin I didn't
even know this was a thing but she's
coming out with a new makeup remover
tool it says an elegantly simple
alternative to the skin rejuvenator that
magnetically removes the chrome clay
mask while helping to reduce the
appearance of pores it's $80 and I'm
like um probably not it's like I mean
it's a tool it's a tool to take off a
mask for $80 that's a little too
expensive for my taste personally I'm
also kind of really reminded me of the
magnetic masks that I have from elf
which I like don't give me like I do
like that mask and it's like fun to play
with but at the same time it's also kind
of like time-consuming and you have to
clean the actual tool that's removing
the mask on your face and I don't reach
for it a lot because it's time-consuming
and it's also messy but that from Al's
like the whole thing was like ten
dollars or something and this for just
the make the skincare mask remover thing
is $80 so I'm like ah no did you guys
know that she had this line I I didn't
so I was like oh well you learned
something new every day in the world of
Instagram okay so moving on I got so
many tags on a pallet that is like a
grease themed palette and once I started
getting tags on it I was like because I
love grease who else loves movie grease
huh so many fond memories of grease okay
so this is from the brand solo look
which I also was not familiar with and I
looked at their Instagram this they've
also done like a dirty dancing palette
and I have like a sneak peek the morning
that I was that I'm filming this and
they're doing like a 902 and L palette I
always get confused how brands can do
this with like like all the copyright
stuff because I know there's some other
brands who like gotten in hot water for
it so I'm like how in the world does
they do this but it says they're coming
out the pink lady's eye shadow palette
says it will be available to pre-order
on June 16th on their website so it has
five or ten different shadows I believe
that's a mirror as well the packaging is
so freaking cool say I'm not familiar
with the brand so I'm not familiar with
their eyeshadows I would love to hear if
you guys have purchased anything from in
the past what what do you think about
them how's the shipping how's the
customer service I always like to ask
those questions for brands that I'm not
familiar with the shades aside actually
looked pretty fun it does appear to be
an all shimmer palette looking at all
the shades there's like a deep blue one
but still that one looks like a shimmer
to me but other than that they're all
shimmers and there's some blues reds
pinks some really pretty lighter shades
you know the names are so cute summer
lovin beauty school so fun I think
mystically I don't think I will purchase
this palette this one would be more of
like a collector type item for me I
don't see a price on it as well so I'm
not sure how much it's gonna be but
especially with it being in all shimmer
palette I don't reach for those as much
as I do palettes that have a mixture of
mat and trimmers or my all matte
palettes so I'm not sure totally how
much use I would get out of it and while
there's a few colors in there that I
think are really pretty I think if I'm
just being like honest with myself I
think I'm gonna say no to it but oh man
grease classic classic movie okay what
are you guys thinking are you gonna pick
that one up I got a lot of types on that
one so you guys love to let me know what
you're thinking I also got a ton of tags
on this next one from huda beauty so
she's coming out with new lips sets so I
love the hood of beauty liquid lipsticks
and I buy a lot of those sets a lot that
come with minis because I just think
they're a good value I very rarely am
going through a lipstick especially a
liquid lipstick especially the hood of
beauty's because they're super liquidy
and you really need like a small amount
of lipstick I've never gone through a
hooded Beauty liquid lipstick so I don't
mind getting the minis but they have new
sets out these are the matte and strobe
sets each set includes two mini matte
liquid lipstick shades and two mini lip
strobe of shades so those are kind of
smart like the metallic liquid lipstick
type shades so I'm going to pass over
them because I would not get used out of
the mini strobes if they were all for
math I would consider it more and I
still AM I'm one of the new mats that
came out recently they have all formats
the purse wasn't on these I think the
last time I looked it's like is it $33
for four minutes or something like that
I want to say but I just know that I
want to get use out of the strobes
they're just not my personal taste and
what I'd gravitate towards so this kind
of set would it make sense for me but if
you love both those different styles or
even wanting to try them I I truly think
the monies are a good deal and that's
typically what I buy the most of but
those particular ones will not be for me
and then moving on so we finally got to
see the new lorac palette so this is the
lorac Pro for propel it forward so we've
gotten a couple
neat peeks of it but nothing like a good
look at the palate so we finally have it
so the pro for palate has 16 shades and
this post doesn't have a price on it but
I'm gonna assume that it'll be $44 like
the other pro pellets typically are so I
have to say when we first saw kind of
like the sneak peak picture I wasn't
like yeah my head's turning and stuff I
was like well you know it's not really
fair if we don't have like a good photo
of it like I don't know what it's gonna
be like and so now that we have the
photo and kind of a close-up of some of
the shades I'm just still not really
very interested in it um truly have I
tried a lorac Pro palette I don't think
I have I've tried some of the other rock
eyeshadow palettes and they're all just
okay to me I actually gravitate more
towards like their base palette over
their eyeshadow palettes and so I can't
say that when I see a new Pro palette
come on I'm like yes because I have one
two and three I'm gonna get four I'm so
excited for it I don't have that and
this one it just didn't really do enough
for me it looks like a very pretty
neutral palette and it does have a lot
of those pinks in there but still it
just wasn't anything that I was like
i'ma go pay four to four dollars for
that cuz I'm pumped up I'm sure plenty
of you are going to be pumped up for it
though so let me know if you're not
really excited when you saw the actual
release photo but I just can't say that
it turned my head or made me do the
double take or anything like that the
next release actually had me a little
bit confused and I had to like read this
several times and I'm still actually
kind of confused on a few things so it's
a new eyeshadow palette from colour-pop
I should have like a color pop segment
i'm roid-boy led by it videos like I
should do like a song-and-dance like Jen
does and Jen loves reviews or her videos
about that okay so they came out with
the make up your mind palette it has six
colors and it says it was selected by
colour-pop cosmetics fans so people got
to vote on what color so they weren't
seen this palette I didn't know that was
going on I didn't vote so I feel like
I'm a part of this palette when that
happened so it says this palette is
available exclusively to their fan pages
first then it says free on your next
purchase of $20 for more use the code
you vote it and just the letter you vote
in but then it says will be available
for everyone July 1st so what does that
meet so is there a difference between
their fan pages and what do they mean by
fan pages because I thought that would
just mean like Facebook or Instagram but
how is it different if people buy it now
with the code through the fan pages I
don't understand and then it says it's
not available till July 1st I didn't
really get it bring through the comments
and most of the comments were like I
don't get it I'm confused am i ordering
it now and it's coming July 1st and like
what where am I supposed to order the
set so I was I'm not sure what's going
on there so it's interesting so it's
basically a free pallet as long as you
purchased $20 I didn't even know that
was a thing because I did just order the
colour-pop no filter foundation and it
just shipped I got my shipping email
today so I'll be doing something with
that soon and I ordered a few other
things too so I'll probably just do a
video with all of them but I guess I
didn't know this was a thing so I didn't
do that but that's kind of interesting
that that's you know basically it's a
$20 pallet but if we're going to
purchase you know the foundation or you
know one of the other bajillion new
releases that colourpop's coming out
with you can also just slide that one
into your cart I I'm not super
interested in though like with all the
colors in there like I think they're
interesting and it's definitely
interesting mix of colors like I wonder
how the voting went did anybody vote can
you tell us how it went like was there
certain shades and you voted on them or
if they're like multiple rounds of
voting like how did we get to these
shades I'm just curious but there's like
a purple in there and a green and a
yellow and a silver and just like
looking at this I'm like I have all of
those shades and palettes I don't think
I would need a different palette just
for you know some of these kind of like
but the topper shades or whatnot so I'm
not super interested in it but I'm more
just like confused by the release though
what does know if you vote it and how it
worked and if you understand their
meaning of it's available now but it's
also not available till July 1st cuz I
don't I'm not I don't understand okay
moving on we have another release from
huda beauty okay we got a lot going on
here
so she is coming out with I will tell
you easy-bake setting powder in 8
different shades plus a brush plus
concealer will be available July 2nd
I don't know prices on anything yet so
bear with me but I will say right off
the bat a setting powder I really don't
need it looks to be like a loose setting
powder which is not totally in my jam
and I feel like I have enough of those
unless everybody tells me this is like
the best setting powder in the whole
world I'm probably gonna go ahead and
say no to it just because it's not my
personal preference the brush is the
double-ended brush again not my personal
preference I don't like storing
double-under brushes and I just don't
feel like I need this one to be honest
and then I was interested in the
concealer because I don't see where the
concealer is like I see the loose
setting powders but the concealer I
didn't really see anything about that so
the concealer I'd be interested in it's
just like a regular concealer like that
I'd be interested in I love concealer
the Sun just one town where'd you go
that one is the one that I'd be the most
interested in but I'll keep an eye on
these I was getting a lot of tags on it
so I thought I'd throw it in here but we
don't have a ton yet but I'll be keeping
keeping an eye out for that
hooda Beauty concealer okay so BH
Cosmetics is also coming out with
another new release BH is like all over
the place lately they are coming out
with so much stuff so they have a new
duo light highlight palette
it says dreamy shades with instant
luminosity it features pearlescent ultra
reflective finishes and says you can
wear it alone or over your favorite
highlighter so it is two formulas and
one palette and you can apply the face
and body for 19 dollars and it will be
available on June 22nd okay so this one
definitely looks interesting there's
some of the shades in here I really like
like looking at the swatches there's a
few shades in that Domino so super
pretty but I'm not really into like the
the prismatic like duochrome type of
highlights they're just not what I am
typically reaching for but again
$19.00 I mean you really can't go wrong
with behaved prices to be honest but I
just feel like this would be one that I
wouldn't get a ton of you
if I can see it just kind of like
sitting in there and every once in a
while I'd reach in for like one or two
shades so even though it is super
affordable I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over it but I mean it definitely looks
very interesting and I can see a lot of
people getting pretty excited over that
and especially over the price tag okay
this next one has an interesting price
tag so I got so many times like so many
tags I can't believe on the on this new
release from Stila cosmetics so they're
coming out the ultimate kit and this is
the vivid and bright kit it's going to
be three hundred and eight dollars to
purchase as a bundle there's a lot in
here six new vivid and vibrant shades of
the shimmer and glow liquid eyeshadows
six new vivid and vibrant eyeshadows
five new intense shades of steel this
number one selling waterproof liquid
liner five new smudge stick waterproof
eyeliner shades and six new all day
liquid lipstick shades stay all day
liquid lipstick check and says you also
get a free bonus gift a mini extreme
lash mascara a mini glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadow encanta karma and the
Stila lip pouch so you're getting a lot
of products for sure but still when you
see a three hundred and eight dollars
like in my mind I'm like man I know you
can break it down and you can justify it
somehow but still when you see a big
number like that you're like wow that's
a lot of money so I immediately was kind
of like whoa whoa whoa and I was reading
the comments people were like why is
this only releasing as a bundle you know
I want one of the shimmering glows I
want one of the eyeliners one of the
eyeshadows but I don't want to spend
three hundred and eight dollars on all
of these products and what I was reading
in the comments is that people are
saying that these are going to be a fall
release and they will be released
individually in the fall Steel is just
giving people a chance to buy the bundle
ahead of time I do not know for sure if
that is true I don't know where the
people in the comments got their
information but I'm gonna go ahead and
say that that's what I saw in the
comments and then I would hope that they
would be releasing these individually I
would be really surprised if they were
only releasing this as a bundle truly
especially for that cost so I will say
that I would not purchase the bundle
myself it's too much money off the bat
there's certain you know items in the
here are colors in here that I'm like
wouldn't use what it used wouldn't use
wouldn't use but there's also a lot in
here that I think is really pretty and
that I will be excited for when they do
release individually which is supposed
to be happening in the fall I would love
to try out their liners because people
say really good things about them I've
never tried the liquid lipsticks would
really like to try them the shimmer and
glow liquid eye shadows those have me
excited but honestly the eyeshadows and
these little pans they look really
really pretty
so I would love to know you know how
much those are gonna be in the fall
because those I think are quite stunning
and you know I'm looking at that purple
I'm looking at that creamy and look at
that pink you know I wouldn't buy
several of the shades probably I maybe
only pick up one to try out but um yeah
this is one where I'm definitely not
gonna buy the bundle it's too much for
too many products that I wouldn't need
but let me know like who who is
interested in buying the bundle I would
love to know or are you more excited for
if they do release individually in the
fall no no you guys know that I don't
know that for sure so again I'm just
reading off the comments of what people
are saying so you didn't let us know if
you saw that somewhere too and it's like
a for sure thing so just want to say
that but definitely some interesting new
releases from Stila which has me excited
and the last thing that i want to talk
about thank goodness need some water
is new releases of from far Sally let's
go say Sephora hello
they're available at Sephora but there's
two new a first Sally jelly bean shades
in rose gold rose gold which is a rose
gold and glow-up which is a champagne
pink with magenta micro-fine glitter so
the jelly bean illuminators they are $40
which is very expensive and they're
supposed to be like a cool like I don't
know I mean like a jelly like a like a
jelly type of highlighter and I've seen
people do their videos with them I've
seen lots of Instagram videos with them
but again they're just not the type of
highlighter that I gravitate towards and
$40 for one highlight is super super
pricey to me I understand that this is
going to last you for your next five
lifetimes because there's you know a lot
of product from there and you only need
a small amount and all of that good
stuff but I just want to be able to
justify spending it because
not my personal makeup preference I'm
just really I'm not into these at all I
can't really see myself purchasing any
of them no matter what color they come
out with or anything like that but let
me know if you guys tried these and like
would you really recommend them I feel
like I was seeing a lot of hype about
them when they first came out and people
were making all their videos and now I
feel like the hype is kind of like died
down and I don't see them as much
anymore so it's like I they've been
worth that price tag I don't know but I
know that I will be passing over them
and after that that's gonna do it for
this week's Bolivian video okay so
there's everything for this week Seville
