today's video is going to be a new will
I buy a video I post my brilliant videos
every single Wednesday where I am
talking about makeup releases and
lunches and just discussing them in
detail and the biggest question is am I
gonna buy it or am I not going to buy it
I started creating these videos quite
some time ago I've now turned it into
the weekly series but I will leave a
playlist linked down below that has all
of my will I buy 8 videos in there in
case you are interested in checking out
past videos so I guess I do post my
videos every single Wednesday and then I
also post on Thursdays Sundays and
Mondays so I post four times a week so I
hope that you will hit the subscribe
button if you haven't already to become
notified when my videos go live but as
always with my will about videos I have
so much to talk about this week so why
don't we go ahead and get started
so for my well I bite videos I really
like to go through the comments on my
videos and see what you guys are
wondering if I'm getting but also I'm
getting a lot of tags on Instagram
lately and this is the one that I think
has had the most tags this week so I
definitely wanted to include it so if
you ever want to tag me if you see a new
Ridley's come up and you want me to talk
about it in a way led by a video I'm
just marcha Beauty word on Instagram so
you can tag me a screenshot it and then
I try to pick the ones that I see that
have like the most questions come in or
the most tags come in so this is from
NARS I believe it's called the are you a
narcissist I shadow palette and I'm
looking at the trend mood one Instagram
page it says it's shades for everyone to
create an everyday look and a smoky eye
for a sexy look it says coming soon in
mid-march so it's kind of hard because
we don't have a price on this yet I was
gonna include this one in next week's
video I was gonna talk about a different
eyeshadow palette today and then I could
not find anything about this eyeshadow
palette so I had no idea what I'd even
say about it so at last minute I decided
to go with the NARS one for this week so
it's a little hard because we don't have
a price point yet I thought I could go
ahead and include it because I kind of
know right off the bat that I'm not
interested in purchasing it mostly
because I'm I'm not a narcissist and by
that I mean that I do not really
purchase from NARS I have a few items
from them and they're mostly just like
sample size that came and like support
orders and things like that but
otherwise I don't really gravitate
toward this friends a lot definitely is
usually like on the price
your side and I don't know I feel like I
hear such good things I especially hear
really good things about their plush and
I always like think I'm gonna do it and
then I just I just don't because you
know I have those brains that I'm still
loyal to and that I continually
continually repurchase from that
sometimes it can be harder to step
outside of my comfort zones but let me
know what you guys think I have no
experience with the NARS eyeshadows like
I said I mostly hear about their blushes
so I really have no idea about their
eyeshadows just looking at the palais it
definitely is a very very neutral
palette we have the lighter shades in
there looks like a lot of like browns
and then there are some deeper shades it
just also would be a palette that I
don't think that I would need it doesn't
make me do a double-take it probably
have these same shades in eyeshadow
palettes or as eyeshadow singles so I
just think it'd be something that I
wouldn't need so I know that the price
tag will probably be a little bit higher
than I prefer to pay for palettes by the
time this video goes up if I do see a
price I can either insert it here I'll
have it in the description box below in
case you're wondering but I just it's
not something that is eye-catching
enough for me to want to pause and
consider and I think a big part of it is
just not being super loyal to the NARS
brand but I would love to know your
guys's thoughts of course let me know
are you a narcissist do you plan on
picking up this palette what do you
think about NARS in general have you
tried their eyeshadows what do you think
of them do you think that you'll be
getting this palette let me know in the
comments down below the next item is a
product that is making a comeback and
everyone everyone's gone bananas
everyone's everyone's lost it everyone
has lost it
that Estee Lauder is bringing back heat
wave so I'm not super familiar with heat
wave my apologies I know remember
hearing about it so much especially
around the time that I started my
youtube channel like everybody was
always using heat wave and everyone is
going crazy and then I don't know if it
got discontinued or what happened but it
went away and everyone cried for days
and now apparently it has come back so
let's see it says it's a part of the new
bronze goddess collection for 2017 and
it's $45 so it's a highlighter and it
looks so stunning I'll insert photos of
course down here
apparently it's already becoming out of
stock look I see its first sale on like
Macy's and Nordstrom's wherever I can
find it still in sale online I'll leave
a link down below but it sounds like it
was going pretty fast but it is also
supposed to be coming in store it looks
really cool it looks beautiful it looks
like a very golden highlight from the
swatches that I can tell and like the
packaging and the inside of it like the
design on the highlight looks very cool
and when I saw it when I saw that I was
coming back and like everyone was like
losing their minds I was like oh my gosh
I must have this highlight like I did it
I did it I did it I said it I was like I
need to have this of course I need to
have this everybody talk about it I need
to have heatwaves like duh and then I
like took a moment and I and I thought
about it and I thought it through and I
was like dude do I really need the
highlight like before I go do something
crazy like do I really need this
highlight so if I break it down it's 45
dollars for one highlighter it was more
expensive
I was just talking about the Becca
cosmetic prismatic amethyst highlighter
I think in last week's bill I buy a
video and it was $38 and I was like
that's too expensive for one highlight
so now I'm talking $45 for one highlight
it's just gonna be too much money for me
I think if I were to buy it I would
truly only be buying it because of the
hype around it and that's not a good
enough reason for me to be purchasing
makeup I need to be smarter when it
comes to my makeup purchases I've
definitely done it in the past
I bought the peach palette because
everybody was freaking out about it I
went to my Ulta at 10 o'clock a.m. so I
could buy the palette it turned out to
be a good thing because I loved that
palette but I don't need to buy makeup
just because it's very hyped about you
know what I'm saying and I so my first
reaction was yes I'm gonna buy it I
truly thought it I thought I was gonna
do it and then I sat down and actually
took a moment and thought about it how
often will I use this product
I don't highlight every single day
because I do deal with texture I like
highlight I like the way it looks but
I've definitely scaled back on my
highlight purchases and I actually have
a highlight to talk about coming up in
this video so I just don't need it you
know I'm saying and I guess that's
something that I'll recommend to you
guys a few of our product and even if
it's being super hyped up just take the
5 minutes and think about it do you
really need it is it good for your
collection is it worth the money if it's
yes and if it's something you can't live
without you know you're gonna use it and
you don't care to spend the money and
then go ahead no one's going to judge
you we don't care it's just makeup but
for me I'm not gonna buy it
too expensive I won't get enough use out
of it but are you gonna buy it because I
have to know are you excited about it
did you already own it from last time
let us know in the comments down below
so the last two products that I have to
talk about are both actually going to be
youtuber collabs and this first one that
I'm going to talk about I actually
wasn't going to talk about
it's a kathleenlights collab but then I
recently just did my kathleenlights made
me buy a video and everybody was asking
about this it's her most recent collab
with colour-pop I also wasn't going to
talk about it I feel like I was just
talking about colour-pop I think I
touched on their Valentine's Day
collection either in a will I buy it or
an anti hell video so I'm like I just
wasn't going to talk about the the
collection at all but then because I was
getting so many questions on that video
I thought that I would include it in
here
I love kathleenlights obviously I've
just made the video showing everything
that she made me buy I find her very
relatable and personable and I go into
all that in that video I like buying her
collabs I've bought a lot of her
colour-pop collabs I have a lot of her
lippies and she recently did the
Aquarius bundle collab I guess you could
call it her it comes with Aquarius in an
ultra glossy lip Aquarius in an ultra
satin lip and then Aquarius too in an
ultra matte lip I know she has an
Aquarius I think it's in an ultra satin
look maybe she has another Aquarius and
then they asked would you want to make
the Aquarius she'd and these other three
formulas that we have and she released
it on her birthday this isn't a super
new product it came out a while ago and
like I said I just I wasn't going to
talk about it because I feel like I
talked about colourpop's so much because
every time you blink they're coming out
with a new product and it's very
overwhelming I could literally talk
about colour-pop every single week like
that's how much they release products so
I was just gonna just kind of skip over
it but I'm not gonna purchase from them
and I think I was talking about it when
I was talking about the color pop
Valentine's Day I've bought a lot from
colour-pop recently and I've bought a
lot of their lippies recently I
purchased a lip bundle I have one of
their new holiday lipsticks that they
came out with and I'm just on like I
need to scale back on color pop right
now because color pop is a dangerous
site because it's so inexpensive when
you get on there you're like oh I can
just add this five dollar lipstick and
this five dollar eyeshadow and then just
boom boom boom and I'll send you have
seventy dollars and you're like how
happen think you don't even know what
happened but then you don't want to put
anything out of your car it's very sad
I've been there I've done it several
times so I'm gonna skip over it mostly
just because I need to press pause on
colour-pop right now I really do but
also because like I said I just
purchased a lot of colour-pop lippie x'
and i I'm a lipstick junkie I'm a
lipstick addicts
I'm like looking around my office and
there's lipsticks and like every single
nook and cranny there's lipsticks that I
bought and I haven't even opened yet I
haven't even used I have too many
lipsticks it's it's getting bad it's
getting bad you guys also another really
big reason it's only $15 if you get the
bundle which that's not a bad price $15
for three lipsticks I think it's awesome
if you're a huge Kathleen supporter if
you love the color Papa B's I mean I
would say totally go for it like go get
it also I have tried the colour-pop
ultra glossy lips and I don't like them
they actually sent me two little samples
because one of my orders was like super
super delayed so they sent me some like
little guys of their glossy lips and I
tried both of them and I actually didn't
really love them so I wouldn't really
like the glossy lip in there the ultra
sound and the ultra matte I'd probably
like just fine but I'm gonna skip over
it no offense to Kathleen lights or
anything like that but I can't purchase
every single youtubers collaboration
that comes out that's just not possible
but I would probably like ultra satin in
the ultra matte the most I believe you
can buy them separately you can buy them
separately as well looks like they're
all $6 to buy separately so you save
three dollars if you purchased them in
the bundle but I'm just gonna go ahead
and skip over it but let us know did you
guys already pick up your Aquarius did
you get the bundle did you get some of
the separates are you still planning on
picking it up let us know so a lot of
you guys are asking me about this one a
lot of texts are coming in I was going
to talk about it anyways because I'm
pretty excited for this release but we
finally have the collaboration between a
youtuber Kacey homes and Smashbox
cosmetics have been following Kacey
homes for a very long time since before
I had my youtube channel she was one of
the first ones that I really like fell
in love with and you know I found her
very relatable even though she already
had so many subscribers at the time when
I started watching her and she clearly
like knew her ish but she's still
someone to me that I found super real
and relatable I still feel that way I
followed her on snapchat
I loved her dogs so much I loved her
dogs so much but she has been hinting
about the Smashbox collaboration for
what feels like five years to me I feel
like we have just been like waiting and
we're on the edge of our seats were like
just dying to know what her
collaboration was and just recently
she's been dropping more hints so that
tends to us and we found out that it was
gonna be a highlight collab then we
found out I was gonna be two palettes
but now we know the rest of the detail
so I wanted to include it in here so she
is coming out with control delight
spotlight palettes one is in Pearl and
one is in gold they're each gonna be $35
and they come with three highlights now
at the time that I'm filming it's
available for Smashbox cache members
which is there like rewards program I am
NOT a part of them but if you were a
part of that program and I think you had
to be on a certain tier level you could
purchase it first but I believe she said
in her snapchat that it will be
available at Sephora and Ulta as well
but basically from Casey homes and
Smashbox we have to highlight palettes
so $35 each for three highlights and see
that's where I can like start saying
that I feel like the highlighters are
more justifiable for me to purchase
versus like the $38 Beca highlight are
now the $45 sa letter where you're just
getting one highlight here we're getting
three for the $35 it's a little bit more
affordable so I appreciate that I do
want to make a purchase of this
highlight palette it's another reason
why I decided to forego the Estee Lauder
palette and it's also another reason I
decided to forego the back of palette
because I knew Casey was coming out this
highlight and I knew that I'd want to
purchase it
I also when I'm going to be making a
purchase for something that I'm not
using on a regular basis or that is a
little bit more money I try to think do
I really need it or you know it kind of
helps me if I'm thinking about
purchasing three of the same type of
items which one do I want the most and
then I go ahead and go with that one and
definitely the Casey and Smashbox one is
the one that I am most excited about I
just I just love Casey homes such a huge
supporter of her and I'm so excited for
the Smashbox collab it looks awesome so
I've been going back and forth I've been
watching the swatches I've been seeing
her snaps at trying to decide between
the Pearl and the gold and I at this
point in time have not decided yet I
know I only need one what I'd love to
purchase both of them and be able to
support you even more yeah sure
but I can't
I just need one I just need one pilot I
can't decide which one that I want the
Pearl palette has these two like like
pinky pinky pearl type of shades that
look stunning but the gold palette it
has this one gold in there that looks
absolutely beautiful like I can't decide
I think I'm leaning towards the pearl
terms of gold I don't know which way I'm
leaning
I don't know which way I'm leaning I'm
not sure one yet it's going to be
available for everybody I'll keep
watching if I see a date that comes up I
can put it in here I'll leave in the
description box down below but at the
time I feel like we don't have that
exact date yet but I'm really excited
when it does come out I'm gonna finally
pick one pellet you guys maybe you guys
can help me out are you guys gonna get
this palette which palette are you
picking do you think it a certain
palette would be better for me let me
know because I seriously can't decide I
know that I only need one though I know
that I know that I just need one but I
am planning on picking one up I'm so
excited for this collaboration I was
very interested to when I heard Casey
say when she was try him on her snapchat
and she said she likes these highlights
because it doesn't like showcase the
texture and honestly I probably would
have called BS on that had I not been
trying this highlight that I'm wearing
right now this is from pixie Beauty and
the Merriam NYC it's in I can't remember
exactly which palette it is because
Marion came out with two palettes but
one has three highlights on the side and
there's a gold highlight at the bottom
I've been wearing it all week I can't
stop wearing it it is like soft and
beautiful and I love it but it truly is
not showing my texture I don't know what
it is I don't feel like I've ever found
a powder highlight especially sometimes
cream highlights are a little better for
me but I don't feel like I found a
powder highlight that does that so in
case you mentioned that I was like mmm
okay because I could get down with that
because that's why I don't wear
highlight a lot because because of my
texture issues so when she said that I I
got immediately really curious so I'm
definitely gonna be picking up one of
the palettes so excited
so excited for her so excited for the
clouds so excited to get my palette I
think the packaging looks so pretty
and I would love to know are you guys
gonna get it do you guys watch Casey
