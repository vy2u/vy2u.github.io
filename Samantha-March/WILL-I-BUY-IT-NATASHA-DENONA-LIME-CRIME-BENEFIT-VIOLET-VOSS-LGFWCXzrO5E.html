today's video is gonna be a new will I
buy it I post my beloved videos every
single Wednesday where I'm chatting
about some new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then also talking over if
I'm going to pick them up or pass over
them and as always I have a lot to chat
about this week so why don't I go ahead
and get started ready so first up I want
to talk about a new eyeshadow palette
this is from a violet Voss it is called
the like a boss palette it has 20
different shades in there and they have
matte and shimmer finishes it's going to
be $45 it says it is coming soon online
in in stores at Sephora as well as the
violet boss website I'm reading from the
treadmill on Instagram so I will have
her Instagram a link in my description
box as I do each week okay
so I'll have a photo of it here on the
screen but I'll say that when I saw it I
didn't have any sort of reaction to it
and that's kind of how I like to base my
makeup purchases it was really
interesting with last week's Vilayet
video and feeling such excitement over
that Urban Decay backtalk palette and it
really was a good reminder to me that if
makeup doesn't excite me or pull me I
don't need to talk myself into it I
don't need to convince myself to buy
something if I'm not truly excited over
it because there's so many new makeup
releases there's so much makeup there's
new brands popping up all the time then
it's just crazy and that I should really
stick with the makeup that actually gets
me excited so I really want to remember
that when I see a new makeup product and
just kind of gauge my reaction if I
don't have a reaction you guys know I
always talk about the double taking my
will invite videos if something doesn't
give me a double take move on like I
don't need to convince myself to buy it
because I'm gonna convince myself to buy
something else the very next day
probably so when I first saw this
violent boss palette I just got no
reaction from it at all so that was a
big you know indicator to me that I
probably do not need this palette I also
own the Holy Grail palette from violet
Foss and the hashtag palette Holy Grail
palette is definitely a favorite of mine
I reached for it a lot I like to travel
with it a lot I love all the matte
shadows in there especially the matte
Browns I love reaching for it for a
really like deep brown smokey eye and
that palette really enjoy it I just got
the hashtag palette recently and I've
been trying it out and I think that it's
okay I actually
have it on my list to feature and review
in my makeup monthly for the month of
February what month February it goes so
fast but I have it on my list to review
and spoiler alert it's just gonna be in
my fine category because I think it's
just okay that one has a lot of shimmers
in it and the and the shimmer is really
called to me like the shades of the
shimmers really call to me in the
hashtag palette but I find myself not
liking the shimmers as much for the
violet ball shadows and I really
gravitate towards their mats which is
weird because I swear I've heard people
say it differently I swear I've heard it
flip-flopped but the shimmers are just
like decent for me so having both of
those palettes and they're very large
palettes having both of those palettes
and having quite an array of shades in
there I just feel like I don't really
need this one and again because it
didn't really call to me it didn't draw
my attention a ton you know it's $45
it's more expensive for an eyeshadow
palette I know that I can go ahead and
skip over it but I'd love to know do you
guys absolutely love by the boss eyes
shadow palettes do you have them all do
you have a favorite I would still say my
favorite would be the holy grail for
sure I would love to know what you're
thinking about this like a boss palette
and if you are interested in this one
but I'm gonna go ahead and say no so
next time I got quite a few tags on this
new release from Benefit Cosmetics
it's the blush palette blush bar it says
it includes the new blush in gold brush
which has a shimmery gold finish I think
it's what it's supposed to say it says
good finish it also has Gala for Nia
dandelion rocket or and a hoola bronzer
it says it'll be available March 8th I
don't see the price in this particular
photo it says that it will be available
on March 8th and it will also be
available at Sephora so if I have the
price I'll leave it in the description
box down below like I normally would but
I don't even like I'm not worried about
what the price is because I know that I
would not buy this I mentioned the Too
Faced there new face palette that's
coming out recently in last week's will
I buy up video and I said I gravitated
towards that quite a bit and then I also
talked about the Urban Decay backtalk
palette which is an eyeshadow palette
but it has space palettes as well so
those are what I'm kind of thinking
about for my face palettes right now so
when I saw this one from benefit I was
like you know what I actually still
would prefer urban decay first then to
face and then benefit so I know that I
would pass over this one
also I have the hoola bronzer I have the
I did have the dandelion blush I
actually decluttered it in my latest
blush declutter because I just don't
reach for it a lot so out of the five
shades I technically do have two of them
even though I did declutter one but I
know that I don't reach for that
dandelion blush a ton because it just
wasn't enough for me so there would only
be really the three shades in there that
I'd gravitate towards and I'm not sure
what I think about the blush that has a
gold finish I don't know I guess to me
that sounds more like a highlight you do
also get the little brush in there which
I actually do like those brushes I keep
my hoola bronzer brush and then I also
have oh the dandelion brush I kept that
brush in there I do like those brushes
but still it's not enough for me to want
this palette and sometimes with benefit
I know that they put out these face
pallets quite a bit but it's like I
don't I just always feel like it's the
same face palette that's coming out and
they're putting the same products in
there like there's always a Lulla in
there but what's funny is one of the
very first products that I purchased
from benefit and this was years ago
before I had a channel and everything
but I always heard people talking about
the benefit hoola I purchased one of
these sets and it had the hoola in there
and had like an eye shot it was more of
like an all-inclusive palette which is
funny because I always say I love all
inclusive pellets and even weighed like
several years ago I was purchasing an
all-inclusive pelic so that I channels
in there a lip gloss it had a mascara
all of that but it's just funny because
the who looking on that like I
understand I love the hoola bronzer
don't get me wrong I really enjoy it I
think it's great but it's just kind of
funny because it comes in everything but
I just feel like with these benefit face
palettes I don't get excited for him
because I feel like it's just the same
thing in everyone and when you already
have one too even more products that's
in the face palette it's like I just
don't know why I find the face palette
when I already have all of those or you
know most of those some of those whatnot
so I just know for me that it would be a
pass I would rather pick up the Too
Faced one or the Urban Decay one versus
this one from a benefit especially to
not have repeat shades but what do you
guys think do you feel that same way
with benefit I just right when I saw
this photo I I just knew I was like I'll
be up there just gonna repeat the same
say shades in
like that's just what they do but I mean
do you collect all of them like you
don't mind you would prefer to have an
appellate versus having singles I'm sure
a lot of people enjoy these pallets and
I'm sure they sell because otherwise why
would benefit continue to keep putting
them out every single year I don't know
that would seem strange to me so I know
that they work for some people and I
know that we're all different but for me
personally I'm just not interested in it
and I would definitely pass over this
one but it gave quite a few tags on this
one from Lime Crime and I kind of went
back and forth on if I was going to talk
about her or not but my own crime came
out what they knew i shadow pellet the
venus XL and it says she's back and
she's bigger and gorgeous so I'm
assuming they also have the Venus pallet
and then this one is bigger probably
with more shades it says a lot of rustic
reds golden roses berries and pinks to
broad neutrals the palette includes a
mirror and it is a $56 so that is
available narrow online and then also at
Ulta beauty lime cream is recently in
uLTA Beauty so I will have any of the
links down below now looking at this
palette I mean I definitely gave it like
a side eye because I'm really into like
the Pink's right now and the Reds you
know all of that like that's kind of
like my makeup tones at the moment and
what I keep reaching for but I just
don't really I don't feel like I have
good vibes from the brand
livecrime and I feel like I've heard
other people say that as well but I used
to be really interested in Lime Crime
and I almost made a purchase from them
once because they have these specific
lip products that everybody was raving
about and I was so close to buying them
I remember being on the site having them
in my cart and I just didn't do it and
then there was a big thing with like
credit card fraud and all of this bad
stuff was happening in people's credit
card information got stolen and all of
that and a lot of it was pointed back to
Lime Crime so I obviously did not make
my purchase so I wasn't affected by it
myself and I was like man that could
have been me like I almost made that
purchase etc and then it didn't seem
like it was handled the best way and
then there was other stuff out there
about the owners of blind payment there
was just there was just a lot of like
weird bad vibes and again this was
probably you know a year ago maybe two
years ago I don't know time flies
so fast it's almost my birthday it was
just crazy time flies very quickly so I
can't remember exactly how long ago it
was but because of that and because of
that situation it just kind of gave me a
bad vibe and I just never went on to
purchase anything from Lyme creme or
really even do any sort of double take
at any of their releases it's just kind
of one of those things that once I get
something in my head it's just kind of
hard for me to get out of it and I'm
just kind of like and you know like I'm
saying there's so many makeup brands
there's so many makeup releases for me
I'm just kind of like I'm always just
looking ahead and seeing what else is
out there and if something kind of like
leaves me with a bad taste I don't
convince myself to give it a try because
you know I'd rather support someone else
but it has been a couple of years now
and they are an Ulta Beauty which that
was another one of like my first
thoughts when I saw them in Alta I was
like okay so hopefully that means that
whatever weird shadiness was happening
with the brand like hopefully that means
it was cleared up if Ulta is gonna
accept them into the stores because I
think that's a pretty big deal so I
don't know what do you guys think am I
the only one who thinks that do you guys
have opinions on mime crime or I don't
know like when do you guys think it's
like it's time to like sweep it under
the rug like move on I don't know I
would love to know what you think and
it's not like like it's not like I'm
trying to like badmouth a company by any
means I'm just saying what I saw in the
past and what turned me off from buying
the brand and then I just never simply
got turned back on so that's why I
haven't made a purchase but I mean this
eyeshadow palette it definitely looks
interesting but it's also a really big
palette and it is $56 and that would be
too much for me to spend on a brand that
I've never made a purchase from in the
past and then I'm a little unsure of I
definitely would purchase from Ulta
versus the Lime Crime website that's for
sure if I am to make a purchase from
lime crema I've definitely got the altar
route because I just feel like it would
be a little bit more secure and such but
I would love to get your guys's feedback
you know have you tried Lime Crime do
you really enjoy the products have you
guys picked up this palette yet I've
seen some people using it online and
I've seen swatches of it and it does
look really nice but I have a lot of
eyeshadow palettes and I just again I
don't think I would need to spend the
$56 as my first purchase was a newer
brand to me I would kind of like to dip
my toes in elsewhere but I don't know
I'd like to know your thoughts I know
it's kind of a tough subject and some
people get really heated about things
like this but that's I mean that's just
my my honest thoughts there that's why I
wasn't purchasing from them in the past
and it just kind of has carried over
into now there's really just but nothing
that is like called my attention enough
to want to purchase but I did think this
eyeshadow palette looked interesting and
they are now at Ulta beauty so I think
that kind of says something but you guys
can let me know what you think down
below but I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over at $56 it's gonna be too much for
an eyeshadow palette for me right now so
I'm gonna say no to this one from mine
cream and then last up I actually have
two new releases from a Natasha de Nona
to talk about the first one is the
tropic palette it has five eyeshadows
and it is going to be a limited edition
and has a mix of matte shimmer and foil
shadows it'll be available March 8th at
Sephora and Beauty lish and it's going
to be the stellar price tag of 129 thank
you so much Natasha
okay so looking at the palette I mean I
got intrigued I gave a little sign I
maybe just a little bit of a double take
because it has some neutrals in there
and then it has some of the pops of
color there's a really pretty purple a
really like beautiful deep blue in there
some of these shimmer colors look pretty
cool and nice green you know so I was
interested in the color selection for
sure but I just can't get over the 1 to
29 price tag for an eyeshadow palette I
have not purchased any of the 129
palettes from Natasha de Nona that just
is such a big number and I know that
people can I know that people can
justify it for themselves and that's
fantastic we can all justify whatever it
is we want to justify if I want to eat
Chinese food two nights in a row your
girl's gonna find a way to justify that
but I know that people can break it down
like you know cost per gram and then and
actually you're getting this margin like
this other palette is even more
expensive and I I fully understand that
and I and I get that and I love that
other people do the math so I don't have
to but at the same time you still have
to give 129 dollars and that's just a
lot and what I shadow palettes I'm
someone who's not necessarily concerned
about stuff like cause program I
actually would prefer things to be
smaller and a little bit less expensive
because I don't get through eyeshadow
palette I'm very gentle with my makeup
so
hitting pan on anything whether it be
eyeshadows or face powders it very
rarely happens because I'm incredibly
gentle and byte handed when it comes to
my makeup and I do have a fairly large
makeup collection so I'm constantly
rotating my items let's just have her
mean hit pan and to go through a shadow
so to have to spend that 1:29 it's just
a lot and it's just I can't do it for
myself even if you can do it that's
wonderful and that's totally up to you
but for just me personally I can't do it
so even though I mean the packaging
looks really beautiful and bright and
summery the colors in there I think are
really fun but I just would not spend
129 there might be a day where I can
start to get into that mindset but I'm
simply not there yet so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over that one but I'd
love to know what you guys think you
know are you immediately drawn to it
someone who absolutely loves her
eyeshadow palettes and it doesn't matter
to you you think they're like their most
quality like you have to have them I'd
love to know your thoughts but her other
new release that has my attention quite
a bit this is a mini you see that a mini
sunset eyeshadow palette so when I first
saw this do her sunset palette which I
believe is a 1:29 palette it has so many
good reviews out there so many people
seem to really enjoy this palette but it
is more expensive so now I'm just coming
out with a 5 pan palette and you know
inspired by that palette so when I saw
this I was like okay that's interesting
and I was like you know what her 5 pan
palettes are still $48 so I'm probably
not gonna do it and then trend moon has
it listed at $24 and I'm like what
what's happening here why is it only $24
I actually went in googled to make sure
because I bought one of her 5 pan
palettes one of the holiday releases I
bought it in the VIP sale but it came to
me shattered and I just went and
returned it they didn't have a new one
in store I just got my money back for it
so I was like I know that was $48 why is
this $24 this is a mistake and then I
was like oh yes man it's a mini and some
mini palettes oh yes it's one of her 5
pan palettes but it's actually even
smaller
I believe the actual palette is smaller
and then the shadows inside are smaller
but if you guys heard what I just said I
prefer minis and I've talked about that
in a video recently whether it comes
even like you know mascara lips
anything because it's very challenging
for me personally to finish makeup
products I do not bind at all buying
minis and paying a lesser amount for a
smaller amount of product that is
totally okay for me so this one this one
has me pretty intrigued $24 for the five
shades it's the mini sunset palette I'm
pretty interested in this one right now
I'm not gonna lie so it's available
March 8th I just might do this one I
this is one that I might do because I
feel like I can just buy that price I
can finally try out Natasha - Nona
eyeshadows and see what I think I'm a
little bit worried cuz I probably would
purchase online you know I love Ebates
I also just hate going to the mall so I
probably purchased online so I'm a
little nervous that it would come to me
shattered but I think the issue was that
Sephora was not packaging items
correctly during the vib sale because
everybody's everything was coming
shattered not just natasha - Nonna so
I'm hoping that was more on Sephora
versus Natasha but I'm interested I'm
interested in this one I've you know the
sunset palette is definitely one that's
caught my attention I would like to try
it many of it I like the shades in there
I like that there's that cranberry in
there there's math there shimmers eye
I'm interested I'm interested 24 dollars
I don't feel like that's a bad price at
all so this one Natasha thank you for
making a mini I think that's fantastic I
hope more brands do that I think that's
pretty cool but yeah I'm excited about
this are you guys excited about it were
you caught off guard when you saw the 24
dollars and it took you a second to
realize that it was a mini do you have
the sunset palette do you think this is
a bad idea like do you think this is
annoying if brands are doing this
because I know there was some you know
not everybody loved that Urban Decay did
the petite heat after the naked heat and
that was another one that I said I don't
mind it because if you don't want to pay
full price for a big palette but you
still want those shades but a smaller
version and save a little bit of money I
don't know so I'm interested in this one
it's going on my wish list and yeah I'm
interested I'm interested in the mini
sunset palette from Natasha - no no but
then after that that's gonna do it for
this week so will i buy it video I guess
oh that's gonna be everything for this
week's will I buy it video I really hope
