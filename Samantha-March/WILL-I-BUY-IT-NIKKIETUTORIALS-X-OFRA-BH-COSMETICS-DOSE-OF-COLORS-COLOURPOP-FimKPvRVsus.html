video can you guys go services hi shrink
giveaway maybe perhaps I would subscribe
so you don't miss out on tomorrow's
video because it's going to be a fun one
but without further ado why don't we go
ahead and get started with the will i
buy it for the well advised i really
like to talk about the products that you
guys are asking me about so you can
always leave a comment down below and
let me know if there's anything that
you'd want me to discuss in the wilayat
video because i go a little bit in-depth
bottom I shall pictures of them I talk
about prices and where you can get them
and what they are and then kind of get
my sauce on them as well so you can
always leave it in the comments down
below you can send it to me on snapchat
I'm coming to that March or I get tagged
a lot on Instagram couple pegs come in
on the bhcosmetics highlight pellets so
there's a backlight highlight palette
and also a spotlight highlight palette
and each pellet includes six shades so I
saw that BH Cosmetics is now at Ulta
which is really exciting BH Cosmetics
was like one of the first makeup brands
that I started buying from that was more
of like like I heard about it from
youtube like it was definitely a YouTube
maybe buy it especially carli bybel she
was always talking about BH Cosmetics
and using their products and so like one
of my very first purchases from
bhcosmetics was like they're huge
eyeshadow palette I've gotten brushes
from them like I just I was really
excited to c bh come into also because
I'm you know I'm definitely that person
that I purchased a lot from Sephora and
also because it's like the points and
that rewards and all that stuff it kind
of sways me if I can buy something
they're over something else I probably
will which I know isn't great but I'm
just being honest so there's two
different
this one looks kind of funky like
looking at the photo that looks like
there's like a blue and not purple and
yellow and the other one looks more of
like the normal highlight palettes and
they look to be like there's two shades
that look lighter but then that they
look to be like for a deeper skin tone
and these are seventeen dollars apiece
so I'll leave everything linked down
below as always I am going to pass over
this because I do not need any more
highlights I said it in the last couple
of videos that I need to like put the
brakes on by more highlights right now
because I just got a lot a lot of
highlights going on in my life right now
and I need to give them the proper
attention so I'm going to pass over it
simply because I don't need it right now
for my collection I definitely need to
be doing some declutter videos coming up
soon and let me know if you guys would
be interested in seeing the clutter
videos but my makeup collection like all
around it just needs help right now but
also my my highlight game like it's it
got out of control like I started not to
wear highlight as much as I wasn't
wearing it on a very daily basis I was
kind of skipping over that part and then
all of a sudden I was like I need
highlights back in my life and I bought
a bunch and it just it's a little out of
control so I'm going to pass over the
bhcosmetics highlights but also i want
to let you guys know if you haven't seen
yet they are bills on also now which is
super exciting very cool I know you guys
are asking me about if i'm going to buy
the new carli bybel collaboration with
BH Cosmetics it will be in the future
will i buy a video but we haven't
actually seen the inside of it yet we've
seen the outside but I need to see it I
need to see the price I need to see
swatches all that good stuff so I can
actually make it in form but like will i
buy it but that's really exciting so
that will be coming up I'm going to pass
over the highlight palaver right now but
let me know in the comments down below
are you guys going to pick this one up
do you need it new life so dose of
colors is releasing some new I shadow
palette success there's two different
palettes one is called the base browns
and one is called the marvelous mob each
one includes five matte shades and a
mini double ended brush they are $32 of
cheese I have never ooh that looks
really pretty I actually really hadn't
been able
look at this much i'm filming i'm trying
to pre film a lot because I'm going on
vacation next week for my birthday so
I'm trying to film as much as I can to
make sure that I don't miss any of my
fiddle videos so i look at the Brown
Palace of the baked brown talent but I
didn't see the marvelous Maas palette I
look really pretty I love mop like such
a moth on the eyes on the lips on the
cheeks like I just I love it all so
there's 32 dollars each when someone
tagged me they said like maybe this
could be my first dose of colors
purchase what I think I've mentioned in
a video that I've never tried dose of
color so I've always wanted to and now
now I I actually really want that mob
eyeshadow palette I don't know why but
you guys thought that was like my actual
reaction in this video when I was
swiping through the trend mood pictures
and that popped up and I was like whoa
wait a second I like that pellet it's
$32 for five shades which is expensive
but I mean you get your double ended
brush but those are always like hit or
miss mostly on the mid side it's kind of
expensive but I feel like maybe I don't
know what dose of colors is for sure
shipping wise i'm sure they have some
sort of like you need to spend this much
money to get free shipping but maybe i
could purchase the marvelous mob
eyeshadow palette and then do a liquid
lipstick because i've always wanted to
do liquid lipsticks from them i'm
literally and looking at my phone right
now they're matte liquid lipsticks are
eighteen dollars really want stone from
dose of colors I feel like everybody
always talks about stone I've always had
my eye on truffle as well so now I'm
really considering i'm really
considering doing this you guys what do
you think let me know in the comments
down below a lot of people when i said
that i form to try dose of colors a lot
of you guys have said that you really do
like the lipstick let me know if you
think this would be a good idea i'm on
the disclosure website right now in my
phone both pallets are still in stock
and it's funny because i'm such like a
neutral eyeshadow where like I wear
brown so so often but for some reason
that mouth pal it just caught my
attention more like it immediately made
me do that double take and that's how I
know like when I'm really interested in
makeup so I'm actually kind of glad I
didn't see that picture ahead of time so
we could
has a moment we had that moment that you
saw that happen I really want to get
that mob eyeshadow palette may be still
and maybe even another liquid lipsticks
because I'm like a little looks like
junkie I can't help myself but let me
know what you guys think in the comments
down below as tried any of the eye
products from dosa colors let me know
what you think of them because I've
never tried the brain before so it
always makes me a little nervous to give
it a shot but I know a lot of you guys
have thought was it lipsticks good so I
can maybe take a chance on eyeshadow
palette oh it was just today like this
morning that people started tagging me
that color pop is coming out with a new
collection because like obviously color
pop is coming out with a new collection
it's been what like four days i'm
sticking out with the collection so new
ones here I'm just you but you guys know
that color pop puts out an insane amount
of stuff like it's friggin bananas how
that they put out things but they are
coming out with the monochromatic
collection phase 2 or the hashtag pink
collection looking at the treadmill on
Instagram again so there's a press
powder highlighter and blush duo which
is sixteen dollars there's a super shock
cheek highlighter in eight dollars
single press eyeshadows our five dollars
each follow the ball quad I shadow
palette it's eighteen dollars there's a
lipstick and lip pencil five dollars
each and ultra satin lips and ultra
matte lips those are six dollars each
phase three is the sand collection and
will be available march twenty sorry to
some of our site and the pink collection
is on sale now Solly's a link down below
as long as it's still in stock I'm not
going to get anything from this like
color pop is just too overwhelming and i
go through phases of color pop or like
i'm really excited about them and i want
to buy stuff and then it's like I get
burned out like I can't keep up with all
their new collections and then things
are always going out of stock so fast
and then I feel weird like talking about
them and we're done because people are
like that went out of stock last year
and I'm like I know but I bought it I
still want to wear it I'm wearing color
pop on my eyes right now I've three
colors off I shows on my eyes but I
don't even know if I need one more in
stock like it's just I don't know they
just overwhelmed me a little bit too
much and right now i'm just still in
that like i'm not going to buy anything
from color
right now like there's a there's other
things that get me going the the colors
the shapes they look really nice but
they also look like that kind of like
you know like the mobs tone pink mouth
tones and I'm more interested right now
and that dose of colors Bob iron shadow
palette so I kind of want to do that
insight know obviously it's much more
expensive than the color pop but I'd
like to be able to try a new brand and
like I said like color past just I just
wish they would slow down sometimes and
I don't allow you guys feel the same way
I look at all your comments I've read
and respond to all the comments a lot of
you guys feel the same way about color
pop like you just want to be like hold
the phone just just slow down a little
bit and there's other brands that do it
to like so many makeup brands to just I
mean someone commented the other day
that was like you can actually do a will
i buy it series every single week
because there's so much makeup that
comes out and I like yes I can never not
think of something to put it away i buy
a video because there's always new
releases and launches there's new brands
coming out etc it's like it it's wild
but it's super fun or makeup lovers here
so it's fun for us and we always type on
myself and listen to the people talk
about makeup i watch youtube videos like
all day long I don't watch TV anymore I
just watched YouTube and I'm watching
Beauty videos because it's so much fun
for me and I'd like to hear other
people's opinions and what they have to
say and the reviews and everything like
that but it's definitely like really
overwhelming at times and even though
color top is super affordable like once
you like really start adding things up
be like yeah you can get expensive in a
hurry so I'm going to pass over this
like I'm just I'm still right now I'm
not in the I really need color pop phase
it'll probably happen again in a couple
months but for right now I still need
anything from colour-pop but let me know
you guys excited for this collection
have you already picked anything up let
me know what you think in the comments
so of course the most exciting thing the
thing that I've been tagged on the most
this week i was getting snapchats about
this the onus that seems like the
youtuber class are what really excites
people what they really want to hear my
thoughts about and which is really fun
for me like i get excited anytime you
guys tag me on instagram post no matter
what even if you just at mark
you do words like you don't even say
anything else you just put my hand all
in there like I get excited because it
means that we're interacting and that's
really super cool to me but definitely
the youtuber tags are like the most like
what people want to see the most and a
new collaboration was announced this
week between youtuber Mickey tutorials
and the brand Oprah cosmetics so they
are coming out with a set so there is
the everglow highlighter it has three
different shades in it for different
skin tones or it can be used as an
eyeshadow and it's kind of like the
round circular all inserts of pictures
here every time I always feel like I
need to explain it but I do put the
pictures in here and then they also have
three liquid lipstick shades there's new
potion which is a mat and then coven
witch the metallic and spell which is
another metallic the scent will be
seventy nine dollars and looking at
trend moods Instagram page and they're
saying that they do have or she saying
that she has a thirty percent discount
code and if you use it the set will be
around 55 30 so if you're someone who's
okay using affiliate code you can get it
for around fifty five dollars if not
you're gonna pay $79 I I'm very recently
started watching making tutorials like
probably within the last year I had like
heard about her and you know I knew
other people are watching our videos but
for some reason I wasn't like
immediately like pulled in order on in
i'm not i'm not really sure why I enjoy
our videos and subscribe to her now I
think I watch every single one of her
videos but she's not someone who I feel
is huge pull towards like I do some
other Beauty youtubers that like I just
really love to support and you know by
their collaborations and like I just I
like feel like we have a friendship I
guess maybe I don't feel like I have a
friendship with Nikki and I don't know
if that makes any sense but that's how I
feel like I still enjoyed watching her
videos a Niley comments for our videos
and my followers grant and all that good
stuff but I don't feel like we're
friends which is weird because you know
I feel like Jacqueline pillows my friend
and Jack was held like who are you girl
you know so there's that i also i don't
think i have tried all for cosmetics yet
i think i have a liquid lipstick from
them and even a lip liner that was sent
in like
a beauty combox or I'll it monthly but
I've never actually tried them out yet
because that's how many lipsticks I have
it it's so disturbing so I actually
never tried Oh frog cosmetics so I know
like people really raised about our
highlighter so so that's you know cool
the highlighters coming out do you guys
heard what I said at the beginning of
video that I don't need any more
highlighters I really don't so that's
like you know one part of this set is
highlight I don't need it and then the
other part of the set is the three
lipsticks I truly don't need any
lipsticks honestly I don't but to me
lipsticks that are in a totally
different category than highlight
because I love lipstick that's really
hard for me to be like oh I need to go
into know by four lipsticks like I can
do with highlights just that's not going
to happen but I don't love metallica
lips they're not my favorite I don't
wear them on a daily basis and i have
like probably 45 medalla clips and i
just don't wear them a lot if they're
not wearable to me you know what I'm
saying like I can wear them in a YouTube
video or an Instagram photo people over
like oh my gosh i love your metallic
lips but i'm not going to go out with my
mentality lips like it's just not what i
want to wait for it so those would not
be wearable to me so really i would get
the most use out of the nude potion
matte lipstick that's it and so I'm
definitely not going to pay seventy nine
dollars and I'm definitely not even
going to paint the $65 for one lipstick
so I'm gonna have to pass over this
collaboration with Nikki tutorials and
all for cosmetics is Nikki no offense to
Oprah it's just I'm not going to get
enough use out of these products and at
first I was like well maybe if they you
know wouldn't come in a set maybe if we
could buy them individually so it would
only be interested in that one liquid
lipstick and that's just not I still
want to buy it I'm not going to get this
set but I would love to know what you
guys think like it's Nikki tutorials
like your friend like you got that
friendship going on and like you
absolutely have to supporter you need
this you love over stuff like you have
to have this collab I would really love
to know your guys's opinions because i
feel like i've been getting asked ever
since Nikki's video came out I've been
getting asked with so many people what I
think about
and I'm like I'm turning the tables on
you guys like what do you think about it
you can't let me know what you think in
the comments down below because I'd love
to know but yeah I'm going to pass over
that collaboration congratulations to
Nikki way to go ofra that's super cool
up very exciting but it's not going to
be one for me so I'm not going to buy it
okay so that's going to be everything
