today's the video it's gonna be a little
bit different and I'm going to be going
through a couple of either like brand
new releases or upcoming makeup releases
and I'm gonna let you guys know I'm
gonna buy these new products so I
haven't really done a video like this
I'm fairly sure but I thought I would do
it because I get so many questions of
you know if I'm gonna buy these certain
new releases and when I think about the
new releases and so I thought maybe I
could start you know some sort of like
series or just like set of videos that
when there's a bunch of new products
about to release to go through them and
what I think are the pros or cons and if
I will buy them so you guys probably
know that I'm just I'm just a regular
old girl like yes I am on YouTube but I
don't get any sort of like PR packages I
really don't work with many brands I'm
not getting these new releases before
they come out so I can't show you like a
traditional video where I'm showing you
swatches and I'm saying hey I think you
should buy this I'm not buy it I'm gonna
go through as a regular makeup lover and
tell you what I think of these new
releases and if I will purchase them on
my own with my own money I thought that
maybe that might be interesting to see I
actually had an entirely different video
idea in mind for today and then when I
was answering like xx snap today of if
I'm gonna buy the new nikkietutorials in
two-faced collab palette I was like you
know what I should just make a video
about this and maybe you guys will find
it interesting I picked out I think five
upcoming or really really new releases I
think they're all mostly like pallets
eyeshadow palettes and such a couple of
them are like collaborations a few are
not but I thought I would just go
through the five let you know what I
think of them and if I think that I
would part with my hard-earned money and
buy these palettes so hopefully you guys
find this video interesting or helpful
in some way of course please do leave me
your comments down below and let me know
what you think but yeah let's just hop
into item number one the nikkietutorials
and two-faced collab why don't we go
ahead and start out with that one so I
will place like product photos here
throughout the videos you can see them
because obviously like I said I'm not
going to be able to be holding them up
for you guys and showing them to you so
first up nikkietutorials in two-faced
they are coming
the collaboration and honestly I think
this collab looks really interesting
because it's not just in eyes shadow
palettes so the actual palette has nine
different eye shadows and then it has
two blushes it has a bronzer and a
highlight so that's all like in the
palette that you get which that's pretty
good that's pretty cool but then also it
comes with a shadow insurance primer I
actually have a couple of the shadow
insurance primer from Too Faced and I
really do like them so looks like you
get a deluxe size of that you get a
deluxe size of the Too Faced better than
sex mascara but it's in purple which i
think is really interesting you also get
like a loose glitter it looks like also
comes with a sketch marker I believe
that is in black so for all of those
items that is $56 now when I first saw
$56 I'm not gonna lie I thought that's
really expensive but I didn't realize
that you were getting the palette you're
getting a mascara a primer a glitter and
a liner you know I think some of those
items are smaller sizes but still that's
really not a bad deal then to pay $56
and get all of that I do think the
shadows look pretty interesting I have
watched Nikki's snaps and videos where
she was using the palette I do think the
shadows do look nice the bronzer in
there is the chocolate Soleil bronzer
which I really do like you get the two
blushes I mean you kind of really have
it all in this palette but that being
said I'm actually not gonna purchase the
shallot I've been thinking about it for
a while and you know I've been thinking
that is a really good deal but honestly
I don't use glitter a lot so I can kind
of like take the glitter away from it
the purple mascara is a really fun idea
I really like it I like that mascara but
to be real with you I'm not gonna wear
purple mascara a whole lot the shadow
insurance primer is I do like the shadow
insurance primer but I do have quite a
few actually here at my house so I don't
know for sure if I'd really be able to
put that one to the test the eyeliner
I've never tried their sketch liner so I
don't know if I would like it or not but
I love eyeliner so I know I would use
that and then of course the palette but
I don't know if I just need all those
extra products or if maybe it's just a
little bit too much for me personally I
still think it's an amazing deal but
thinking about it for me
and what I needed my makeup collection I
don't really need all those things and I
probably wouldn't use them a whole lot
and then honestly it's so hard to
explain but like the biggest reason that
I'm not going to purchase this is
because I just don't get that feel for
it you know one like you see a new
release coming out you're like oh my
gosh it looks amazing I have to have
that like I just don't feel that way
with this palette I'm actually really
really new to watching nikkietutorials
like within the past three months I
really was not very familiar with her
even for the first couple months that I
was on YouTube like I would hear her
name but I didn't really watch her
videos which you guys are so many
different beauty influencers out there
there's no way that we can all watch
every single one of them I am subscribed
to her channel now and I love her videos
and I think her tutorials are absolutely
amazing but I don't know something about
this one just doesn't give me that like
oh my gosh I absolutely have to have
this palette like I just don't feel that
way so there are other pellets out there
or other makeup items out there that I
get that like homie and I really really
really really really want this you know
and it's because I don't get it with
this certain collaboration I am gonna
pass on buying it but that's that if you
guys really like to face if you like
nikkietutorials
I really do think this is a great deal
for $56 and to get all of those products
I think that is pretty amazing the
palette itself looks really pretty like
the packaging of it looks so nice like I
do think this is a good deal and would
be a good buy just for me personally
those are kind of my reasons why I'm not
gonna buy it but is another one that so
many people asked if I would be
purchasing and it is the Chi shadow
eyeshadow palette from Kylie cosmetics
and Kylie Jenner so this is a nine eyes
shadow palette and it's called the
Rong's palette so a lot of the shades
were very alike neutral bronzy type of
shades I mean pretty much exactly what
Kylie Jenner does where it was running
for $42 it is sold out at the time that
I'm filming this video that it will be
restocked and that sort of thing but I
truly have no interest in buying it I
didn't even look at it really I mean I
saw people snapping about it and I saw
it on social media but I never actually
looked into it myself because I just
knew I wasn't going to get it it's
thing against the pallet because I am
more of like a bronzy war neutral type
of eyeshadow where but and it's not even
that I didn't want to pay $42 for an
eyeshadow palette but the cost of
shipping for Kylie cosmetics just really
gets me and I just I just don't want to
purchase anything else from her and have
to pay almost $10 for shipping it's just
crazy to me I have purchased like her
when her three original lip glosses came
out I purchased the lip glosses and I
purchased the candy K lip kit for myself
and I had like a giveaway item in there
as well and I think I spent like at
least close to $100 and I still had to
pay the 895 shipping and I was like that
sucks but you have to pay for shipping
no matter what no matter how much you
order no matter how much you purchase
you have to pay for shipping and I just
kind of think that's crazy especially
because we know the person behind this
cosmetics line doesn't need to be
charging people for shipping like I
truly don't care that her prices are
more expensive like whatever I just
think the shipping is kind of crazy I
just don't really care about the hype
around it
I honestly I've been watching a lot of
the videos with people talking about the
eyeshadow palette to see what they think
of it honestly I think it's really
really slug I've seen people absolutely
being like head-over-heels in love with
this palette and I've had some people be
like the quality's not great like to
even like make the shadows try to play
together like it's not good so I truly
don't know I can't speak on the quality
of the palette because I don't have it
but I know that I'm not going to
purchase this palette I just I really
don't have a lot of interest in it I
don't know those are just a few reasons
why that I'm not gonna get to the chiral
palettes I just I don't know something
about the color cosmetics it just it
doesn't make me like want to bow down
like so many people do I just I just
don't really care hanging out with a
pretty exciting collab this club I
believe is not coming out until December
but it recently I think it was just this
the fleeca that's the actual like
pictures of the palettes and everything
that's coming in the collab collection
got announced and people are like
freaking out but it's a collab between
two-faced and Kat Von D which i think is
super interesting
and I first saw the picture of the
actual pallet like not inside just the
picture of the pellet and I'll insert
the pictures here but you can see the
one side is the pink in the to face and
then the other half is like the black
and the Kat Von D and I was like okay
alright and then I saw the pictures of
it opened up and you get five eyeshadow
of shades on each side so you have five
from the toothpaste side and five from
the Kat Von D side I have to say it's
looking pretty interesting and then also
in addition to the eyeshadows you get
the Kat Von D I believe it's the trooper
eyeliner which is a very very good
eyeliner and then the Too Faced better
than sex mascara which I love the Too
Faced better than sex mascara now I have
not been able to find a price on this if
I can find the price I can put it in
here or put it in the description box
below but at the time that I was
researching this very like
spur-of-the-moment video I wasn't able
to find a price but I did confirm that
the eyeliner and the mascara that you
get are both both sides and then you're
getting the ten a shadow palettes
honestly guys right now I mean this does
not come out until December but I'm
leaning towards getting it I do really
like to face and I really love Kat Von D
and so much that she comes out with and
so I just think this collab could be
very very interesting I'm very curious
about the shadows and I think it looks
like a good one so I don't know I'll
have to get like try to see what the
price is and I have a while to think
about it you know all the holiday
palettes are gonna start coming out soon
too but as of right now I'm leaning
towards yes on that one come on talk
about is from a Pierre cosmetics and
it's called the love your selfie too
there is a love your selfie palette and
this one is the newer palette I believe
it is on sale right now it's $42 I'm
looking at the Ulta website it is $42
and it comes with eight different
eyeshadows and then it comes with a
translucent powder which I think was
really interesting a rose gold
illuminator a neutral bronzer you get a
lip pencil a lip gloss and they're fully
charged to mascara which I haven't used
that mascara myself but I hear so many
good things about that mascara so again
for that entire kit and kaboodle right
there is $42 now I think I am gonna
purchase this palette because I can't
stop like going to look at it I saw it
come out on social media at first and I
saw like the first glimpses of it
I'm kind of right off the bat it
reminded me just a little bit of like
the Anasazi of Modern Renaissance Pilate
just looked kind of like those warm
colors there's like a warm kind of like
red rust color in there that reminded me
of that palette there's a really pretty
like shimmery gold in there and I'm not
saying they're like super similar but
like when I first saw the picture of it
I was like huh that kind of reminds me
the modern Renaissance which I don't
have myself so I'll say that but it just
kind of caught my eye right away and
then I went and I looked it up some more
and I saw what was all included in it
and for $42 I was like okay okay you
know that's not that's not a bad price
the more I keep looking at it I'm like I
think that's really interesting that a
palette is coming with a translucent
powder you know usually you don't see
that usually see like a blush or bronzer
or the highlighter I think it's
interesting that it comes with the lip
gloss and the lip pencil I would like to
try those but I don't for some reason
this is the one how like I was saying
with the nikkietutorials and two-faced
I wasn't like excited about it I didn't
keep looking at it up I wasn't
gravitating towards it but for some
reason this pure palate has me keep
going and looking at it I keep pulling
up the Pierre website and I'm already
looking at the early reviews of it like
do I need that palette in my life and
the more I think about it the more that
I think I do I think I am gonna purchase
the love yourself e2 palette I'm really
excited for it it's it's not one that I
feel like is as hyped especially as some
of these collabs with like the YouTube
creators and beauty influencers but I
think it looks really good so I'm really
curious to try it out but I do have it
in my opinion to purchase it talk about
is another collab and this one is
between styled by her Uche and Tarte
cosmetics palette is going to launch
online I believe it's August 21st and
then it will be in stores
September 4th and it is $30 and you get
six eyeshadows and then one blush I will
insert the picture over here so you guys
can see it as well so I honestly am NOT
super super familiar with her Uche I
know that she is like a very well-known
and well-respected makeup artist I
believe she worked with the Kardashians
and still does their makeup and that
sort of thing I see her popping up on
like different people snapchats like
and dezzy is not someone who like I
follow very regularly but when I saw
this palette come out it just looks very
like sleek and kind of like
sophisticated and I don't know on first
glance this was a palette that kind of
made me do a double-take I was like wait
a second do I need that so you are only
getting six eyeshadows and a blush so
compared to some of the other palettes
that I've talked about in this video
where you get blushes and bronzers and
illuminators and lippies and mascaras
and etc etc you're kind of not getting
as much in this palette it is $30 so
it's not as expensive as some of the
other ones either it is with Tarte
cosmetics and Tarte happens to be one of
my favorite brands I have been
purchasing more and more and more from
Tarte
and I'm finding myself extremely happy
with them so I don't it's coupled with
that I just I really like the way that
palette looks $30 is not a bad price
I don't think and then being that it's
with Tarte cosmetics who I really really
like their products I'm kind of like
this is another one that I think I think
I might I think I might purchase this
one you guys I think I might get it I've
been thinking about it think about it
since I saw it and if I should do it and
now I feel like I'm talking myself into
it this is a very spur-of-the-moment
video if you can't tell I'm literally
just giving you thoughts off the top of
my head I have no plans no notes no
anything on this video and the more I
think about it the more the more I think
I'm gonna get it I really like the
shades I'm looking at the shades on my
computer right now just kind of like the
me shades you know there's nothing like
real super crazy in here besides royal
looks like a very deep sparkly I don't
know if it's like a red or pink really
from from where I'm sitting I can't
quite tell the blush looks like a blush
that I would wear in my life and I just
I think it looks really pretty guys I
think I might have to deal on - what do
you guys think should I do it I think I
just talked myself into it yep I'm
probably gonna buy this one - it's only
$30 not as bad hey if I can buy that and
the pure one at the same time from Ulta
then I could probably save some money
and just like rack up some points and
get free shipping
look at that look at how I just
justified that everything for this video
and the will I buy it I have really no
idea what I'm going to call this
because I just came up with the idea for
it but do you guys like this video idea
please do let me know because I I really
don't know but I just thought it would
be fun to share my thoughts with you on
some like hot new products and collabs
that are coming out and if myself as a
regular ol makeup lover who doesn't get
sent these beautiful packages if I would
buy these with my hard-earned money and
let these makeup brands take my money
from me and I think I talked to myself
into a few a few items in here but I
would love to know if you guys are gonna
buy any of these products like is there
anything in here that I mentioned that
you're like yep I'm setting my alarm the
day that that goes live I'm getting it
or I already bought it and I don't know
I'm just curious like what do you guys
think what are you gonna buy if you guys
do like this type of video idea please
do leave some comments below of like
what you would want to see next whether
it's like a particular makeup item or if
it's something in specific that you'd
want to see me talk about because I
actually had a lot of fun filming to
this and actually like going through my
reasonings for it I don't feel like I
really get to sit down and talk to you
guys about what I might buy it's usually
everything that I've already bought and
I'm already showing you guys that I
bought it or then I'm reviewing it or
I'm actually testing it out in tutorials
so this was kind of different but I
actually really liked it I don't know
let me know if you guys liked it because
hopefully you do but your feedback is
really so very important to me so please

this type of video and maybe I can do
