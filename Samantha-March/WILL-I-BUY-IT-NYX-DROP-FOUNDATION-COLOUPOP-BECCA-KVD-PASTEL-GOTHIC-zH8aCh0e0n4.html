today's video is going to a new oil
light by a video I post my Vilayet
videos every single Wednesday on my
channel so I hope that you will hit that
subscribe button down below
so they'll get notified for all of my
future videos including my will I buy up
Wednesdays so far my will I buy it I
started the series a while back before I
was getting any sort of like PR packages
or things like that as a way to be able
to talk about new releases or items
coming back in stock makeup lunches just
things that us as makeup lovers are
excited about and talked about a fall
buy them if I won't buy them and the
reasons why I will and well not just
kind of a fun different idea to sit down
and talk to everybody as a regular
person as a friend I did want to touch
on one thing because in last week's
video I was talking about some new
releases from pure cosmetics and I
mentioned that p.r actually sent me a PR
package they sent me a package with
their neutrals eyeshadow palette and all
of a sudden all of the hateful comments
starting coming in about how I need to
stop doing these videos because now I'm
getting PR packages and yada yada yada
so I'm doing these will I write videos
because like I say I don't get a lot of
PR packages I get some here and there
that's the first package that I've
gotten from a big brand in a very long
time I've can probably count on one hand
how many packages I've gotten from big
brands with makeup inside so I still
very much consider myself someone who
does not get PR packages I'm not on any
PR list I don't get new releases from
any companies like on a regular type of
basis I actually email Pierre with a
video idea that I have for them that
you'll see coming up and asked if they
would want to send me anything that I
could include in the video and that is
why they sent me the trolls palette
which I was very excited about and
appreciates it for but I don't want
people to get it twisted and to all of a
sudden start thinking that I'm getting
all of these packages and all of these
crazy things I've never had a company
send me something with like an entire
line of something like you see the PR
packages I don't get bottles of shampoo
pane and new shoes and beads and drones
etc etc I don't get those kind of things
guys that's why I decided to make these
videos to talk about products and just
try to be a real person so I want to
throw that out there there was also some
confusion people who are considering PR
packages being like what I get from
Influenster and actally those are not PR
packages those are not brand saying hey
we think you're super cool take some of
our makeup and do what you want with it
those are third-party websites that you
have to basically kind of like show your
worth to them you have to show your
social media accounts and your following
and like with octal 8 you have to apply
to get products you have to say we're
gonna post and why it's a good idea for
a brand to send you something etc and
then you have to review it like
especially with octal II you have 21
days and you have to review that product
or you can get dropped from them so
those are not PR packages so that's what
I consider like vlogger mail and that's
what I talked about in my last PR slash
vlogger mail haul so I wanted to put
that out there real quick because there
seemed to be some confusion over things
like that so hopefully that helps clear
things out a little bit we'll see but
anyways I just wanted to get that out
there you know my goal with my channel
is hopefully yeah I hope to get a great
PR packages from company someday I hope
to be recognized and hopefully brands
will see you know she puts a lot of
commitment into her channel into her
Instagram I post at least four times a
week on YouTube I post three times a day
every single day on Instagram I'm
constantly trying to create and come up
with new ideas and be social with my
followers and subscribers and talk to
you and get on snapchat every single day
hopefully that would be recognized
someday and people would like to start
sending me more products so that I can
review them so I can come up with more
content for my channel and that sort of
thing and hopefully by you know sending
me items so then I don't have to buy
them I can put more into my giveaways I
do give away all the time either on
YouTube on Instagram on snapchat I feel
like I'm constantly running some sort of
giveaway because I'm trying to say thank
you to you guys and it would help
immensely if I wouldn't have to feel so
much pressure to buy all these items so
that I can review them and show them to
you on my channel if I was getting them
and that meant I could put more money
not only into my giveaways but into my
equipment I'm always complaining about
my lighting etc like yeah I I sure hoped
that that would happen someday I would
hope that that wouldn't change me at all
or change my opinions or or anything
like that but I'm not there yet guys so
I appreciate some of you thinking that
like I'm super cool and giving these
great packages I'm not there yet so I
did just want to touch on that because
last week's comments were were
interesting so hopefully that helps
clear things a little bit I don't know
we'll see but as always with my will
abide videos I of course have a lot to
chat about so why don't I go ahead and
get started okay so a lot of you guys
were asking me about the NYX total
control Drop Foundation and I was really
excited to see this come up in the
comments and I quite a few people on
snapchat asking me about it as well and
I'm really excited about this foundation
I'm looking at the alto website looks
like it is $13.99 and there are 12
different shades I believe it says from
sheer to full your ideal coverage is
just drops away with NYX Cosmetics total
controlled drop foundation fine-tune
this velvety matte foundation with the
included dropper simply adjust the
number of drops until you create what
you feeling today if you want more
coverage add more drops okay makes sense
so this is very interesting to me and
I'm pretty curious about this this isn't
like this is already out like people for
snapping me seeing it actually at the
Altos stores I haven't been to my alte
store in a while so I think it's also in
stores and also online
I am super into this I wish I wasn't
13.9 because that's kind of expensive
for a drugstore foundation I know that
NYX is usually priced a little bit
higher but $13.99 still pretty expensive
for a drugstore foundation at the time
I'm looking on altas website NYX is
having buy one get one half off which is
pretty common for Ulta so that's good so
I would probably try to get this from
Ulta and do the buy one get one half off
or have like your 350 off coupon type of
thing because I feel like that's a
little bit more expensive but I think I
would like to buy this let me know what
you guys think would you want to see a
review on this foundation I just think
it's really interesting I want to try
I would like to try it with like you
know the two to three drops maybe and
see what the lighter coverage is and
then tried to build it up like is it
gonna be easy to build up the foundation
is there a thing like can you put too
many drops in the foundation and then
you look maybe like you have cake face I
don't know but I'm curious about it I
think this looks like a lot of fun Nick
seems to be stepping up their game and
coming out with some new fun things and
I really like Nick's as a brand I own a
lot from Nick's I don't think I have a
lot of their face products but I hear
good things about like their concealer I
think they have a setting powder that I
hear good things about but I mostly just
have like their lippies I do have a
contour and concealer stick from them
which I love I use it all of the time so
I do have that from them and I would not
be opposed to trying out this new
foundation from NYX but let me know in
the comments down below have any of you
guys gotten a hold of this yet what do
you think of it would you want to see a
review video on it I'm pretty curious
about this so I think I will go ahead
and pick up at least one of the NYX
Cosmetics total control a drop
foundation and I'm excited to try it out
colour-pop is such a hot brand that
people asked for me to put in they
suppose I have videos and they also do
new releases like crazy I feel like
every single week that I post so will I
buy it
someone's asking about new colour-pop
because they're always coming out with
something that's so crazy so what they
recently released is single pressed
eyeshadows so these are different from
their super shock shadows like the the
single ones that calming kind of like
the white
casing that you see a lot so these are
different these look more like the
makeup geek eyeshadows the Anastacio
singles things like that so they retreat
least a ton of colors I'm not for sure
how many colors there are but I think it
was like at least 20 if not more so
they're pressed powder shadows they are
five dollars each if you buy four
shadows you get an empty palette for
free which is pretty cool and I'm also
reading that these Presta shadows are
permanent so the color pub you know I
really like color pop I think they're a
great brand I think they're super
affordable sometimes they can kind of
overwhelm me on the new releases
like I'm like I can't I can't take any
more like how do you guys release things
this fast it's so crazy I was very
curious to see their new eyeshadows I am
really interested in the new formula
since it'll be different than the super
shock formula
I like color pub eyeshadows but I don't
reach for them a ton because they really
are applied best with your fingers
instead of a brush and I have long nails
and sometimes it's hard for me to not
only get my finger in there but then to
try to apply to my eye with my with my
nails it's like sometimes it's just a
no-go so I really like them but I don't
gravitate towards them a ton for that
reason so I'm super curious about the
new formula because will it be easier to
apply with brushes that could be a cool
thing the shades that I've seen released
I mean look like a little bit of
everything the neutrals the Browns the
pop of colors I mean it just is
craziness I like that they're $5 a piece
I feel like that's a very affordable I
think it's cool the promotion that
they're running with it that you get the
palettes for free I think that's really
neat I like that idea because that's
really great to be able to have you know
something to put them in I don't have
like a ton of Z palettes I have one Z
palette and I think it holds nine eyes
shadows I mean I already have seven
makeup geek shadows in there so I think
that's great to be honest I'm not going
to buy them right now
I love that they're permanent I love
love love and things are permanent so
use our permanent items so I will
probably buy from these down the road I
just don't feel like I need them right
now they released on Friday I think it
was January 13th was their release and I
mean I didn't even get on the website I
didn't look at the shadows or anything
I've seen a couple of youtubers put out
the videos because they got PR packages
they got PR packages I did not get the
pure package with all of the pressed
eyeshadows I did not get that um so I've
seen a couple of the videos have gone
out but I actually haven't watched any
of them yet just because I knew I wasn't
going to get them if I was going to I
would watch to see the swatches and see
the feedback I'm still going to watch
them but it wasn't like I need to watch
these right now because I know I want to
purchase them you guys know I talk about
a lot of my will I buy up videos I'm not
a huge
junkie person I also don't purchase a
ton of single eyeshadows like I don't
know and I honestly don't know if I
would rather purchase an eyeshadow
palette or if I would rather purchase
eyeshadows singles I really don't know
but I think I'm leaning more towards
eyeshadow palettes these days versus the
single shadows because I actually can't
really remember the last time I
purchased a single shadow
I don't purchase single eyeshadows a lot
they tend to get forgotten about because
I'm usually reaching for pallets if that
makes sense
so at this time right now I'm not gonna
purchase them but they're definitely
gonna be on my radar I'm gonna keep
watching I want to see the feedback and
see what people are saying but I love
that it's permanent I think it's great
I'm not sure if the palette promotion is
always going to be permanent or if
that's like a limited edition thing it'd
be really cool if they kept it around I
don't know that for sure I didn't see
that information but these will
definitely stay on my radar I will
probably purchase them down the road but
not quite yet at this time but of course
let me know in the comments down below
did you guys get any on Friday what
shades did you get and if anyone's
gotten them yet let us know what you
think well becca cosmetics is coming out
with a lot of products i have just one
i'm gonna talk about right now this is
the one i've seen several people
requested and it was requested for a few
weeks back but i didn't get into it yet
so i wanted to talk about this one it's
the first light priming filter it says
it's an instant complexion refresh a
wake-up call for the skin cool light
technology softly scatters translucent
cool violet light to brighten and even
out imperfections for a look that is
fresh healthy and glistening okay so it
looks really similar to like the Becca
backlight priming filter look the
packaging looks really similar I'll of
course include photos on here except the
inside of course is full so that's very
interesting okay so it is $38 and you
know basically is this skin awakening
primer okay so when people first were
requesting it on my videos I was like
I've never heard of this what is it so I
went to the bucket Instagram and then
the website to figure out what it
was so basically what it all boils down
to is that
a primer so I'll be honest I think it's
cool I think it's it's innovative I like
it it's cool it's kind of like trendy I
totally get it I'm done with it I'm not
a huge primer person and I say this and
I feel like a beauty vlogger when I say
that sometimes I skip primers not even
on purpose like I just forget like I'm
just so excited to go on with my
foundation that I forget about my primer
that does happen or a lot of times I
just like to use like a spray primer
like I have some Scandanavia like the
primer that you're supposed to spray
before you do your makeup I spray that
and I think it's great of course I have
primers I have the Becca backlight
priming filter so I do have primers and
you know if I'm going out all day or
doing a special event I will use primer
but it's not something that I use on a
daily basis it's not something I use
every single time I do my makeup
I'm just being super honest with you
guys here so would I buy it I don't
think so because I don't think it's
something that makes sense to me to buy
a $38.00 primer that I won't use very
often like the Becca backlight priming
filter I mean I used it quite a bit in
the summer I'll be honest there because
it just kind of gives your skin like a
more like luminous glow so a lot of days
like if I didn't want to wear makeup I
didn't want to put heavy foundation on a
lot of times I would either just put
that primer on or I would put the primer
on and then like a BB cream or attendant
moisturizer and call it a day but like
especially in the winter like I have not
used it at all even though you would
think I would like to be looking
luminous but I definitely found myself
wearing it more in the summer again
being honest I haven't used it touched
it once in the winter so I just don't
think it's a product that I would reach
for a ton and $38 is more expensive for
primer so it just you know it just is
for me I definitely try to be conscious
of what I'm spending my money on I've
talked about it several times in the
will i buy videos i am an author that's
what I do for my full-time job and it's
not a huge money-making job by any
stretch of the imagination
so I do you know I need to be pretty
particular especially when it comes to
makeup what I'm spending my money on and
just trying to be smart and seeing what
I need for my collection what I'm going
to use the most what I'm gonna get the
most use out of so for me it just
when it makes sense for my collection so
I'm gonna skip over this one but thank
you for all the suggestions that came in
and like I said Becca is releasing a lot
of new products like like right now like
because Becca's there I feel like every
time I log into Instagram I'm either
seeing something new from the Bekaa
Instagram page or the trend mood one
Instagram page talking about a new Becca
release so if there's anything else from
the Becca new releases that you would
want to see me talk about in future will
I buy eight videos please do just leave
that down in the comments below of
course also let us know are you gonna
get this one have you already gotten
this one let us know it's one more I'm
losing the light so trying to do this as
quickly as I can so a lot of people are
asking about the new palette from Kat
Von D this is the pastel goth eyeshadow
palette so I'm looking at the Sephora
website it says it's $38 a Sephora
exclusive and also limited edition so it
says an all new eyeshadow palette of
eight matte pastel shades brighten up
your eye look with a fresh new take on
edgy neutrals inspired by the hashtag
pastel goth trend on social media so the
pallid features high pigment pastels in
a range of soft tones and Kat Von D
signature matte formula so $30 I don't
think is a bad price I know it's kind of
you know like ish maybe a smaller
palette with the eight eyes shadows and
they don't say how much is in the
eyeshadows right on here mm-hmm
that's a little frustrating I wish I
could see how many they are but that's
okay so there's a fun yellow pink some
Purple's blues greens and then like the
more like neutral grays and stuff so $38
I don't think is a bad price it looks
really funky and cool like if you're
into like really colorful looks I feel
like this would be a super awesome pilot
to have and then actually someone on my
snapchat asked if I would mention this
in a wilayat video and she had gotten
the palette and she showed me swatches
on her arms the swatches looked really
good like the colors looked supercool on
her arm so from what I'm seeing so far
just from that and just like the little
bit that I've seen online and on
Instagram and such it looks like a
really good palette you guys if you love
Kat Von D if you are like a cat 1d
collector or if you like these kind of
shadow looks I think this palette would
be super awesome for your collection for
me personally I don't think it would
really fit into the type of makeup looks
I do I'm such like you know guys I'm
such a neutral person and I know I'm
trying to step out of my comfort zone a
little bit and I think this palette
would be a really good one step out of
the comfort zone but when it comes to
every single day when it comes to I'm
not filming I'm not doing a tutorial I'm
just being myself on an everyday type of
basis I'm reaching for my Browns and my
neutrals and that's just that's just the
way I am that's just what I prefer so
for right now I don't think it's gonna
make the most sense to me and I
definitely do have shades in my
collection with the pops of colors I
have greens and I have blues and I have
purples in my collection I don't have
any yellows so actually the yellow light
kind of really intrigued me because I
actually looked the other day I have no
yellow in my collections that's kind of
crazy right so that's a color that like
kind of intrigued me but everything else
I feel like I already have or you know
if I was going to do a Vereen look I
have that if I'm gonna do a blue look I
do have that so I think I'm okay to pass
on it right now I do typically mention
my will I buy it I try not to buy a ton
of a limited edition reason being is
because it's harder down the road to
when I am doing tutorials it's harder to
use the makeup that's limited edition
that is no longer available because
people can get pretty frustrated you
know that's limited edition that's not
available anymore I can't buy it will
you use something that's in stock or
that we can get so I definitely try to
be aware of that so that's a big thing
for me too but I mean I'm gonna pass on
the pastel goth eyeshadow palette from
Kat Von D but I definitely think it
looks cool like if this is something
that you're in the market for I think
it's pretty cool looking but also trying
my best to you know save money I feel
like at the beginning of the year we're
a little bit more like holding tighter
onto the purse strings like you know we
have our New Year's resolutions that
don't overspend keep within your budget
and I'm definitely on that train right
now so I'm trying I actually have not
bought any makeup right now in 2017 I
know it's been like two weeks go me
right that's
another big reason to I'm gonna try to
be a lot more particular about what I'm
buying this year just so I can save up
for something cool like better lights or
you know attending an event like Jen
Beauty or something like that I think
would be really amazing to do in 2017 so
that's another reason why I'm going to
skip over this just because I truly
don't think I need it for my collection
so let us know in the comments down
below of course if you've gotten it or
if you do plan to pick it up okay so
it's gonna be everything for this week
so will i buy it video I of course hope
that you enjoyed this video or found it
helpful I would love to hear in the
comments down below what you thought
about the products that I talked about
have you gotten them will you get them
are you going to pass over them of

what you would want to see in next
week's will I buy video I hope you guys
also keep in mind I get a ton of
comments not only here but on Instagram
and on snapchat and I only try to
include about four or so products in
each video and they're still between 20
and 30 minute long videos and then I get
the hate comments of like my videos are
too long and nobody has time to watch
them so so I try I'm trying to keep a
balance but please don't be upset if I'm
not including the products that you are
requesting because I'm trying and I'm
trying to see what you know is coming in
multiple times from a lot of different
people and including those in the will I
buy up video so please keep leaving your
requests I will try to get through as
many as I can I love that this is a
weekly series now because I feel like
I'm really being able to hit a lot more
products than I was back when I was only
doing these about once a month so thank
you guys so much I appreciate the
comments so much of what people are
doing a lot now is actually tagging me
directly on Instagram if a brand or even
like trend mode is talking about a new
product you guys are tagging me right
there and asking me to put it in a will
I buy up video and I'm just screen
chatting it and keeping it in a special
folder on my phone so I can check back
when I am planning out this video so

helpful I appreciate it so much thank
