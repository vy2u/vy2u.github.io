today's video is going to be a meal will
i buy it I post my videos every single
Wednesday or I'm talking about some new
makeup releases and launches letting you
know a little bit about them and then
letting you know if I'm going to be
picking them up or passing over them as
always with my will i buy videos I have
left to chat about this week so if I'm
gonna go ahead and get started first up
I got quite a few tags on this one I
feel like I get tagged on Pat McGrath
makeup quite a bit so Pat McGrath is
coming out with some new makeup of what
I was getting tagged on the most was
these eyeshadow palettes so that is what
I'm going to talk about so the mother
ship eyeshadow palettes by Pat McGrath
there's going to be three different
palettes each one comes with ten
different shades inside and they are a
hundred and twenty-five dollars each
that's a lot of money that's that's a
lot of money that is a lot of money for
an eyeshadow palette it's coming up with
a couple other new items as well new
lipsticks lip liner eyeliner mascaras
the launch dates for each item is
different which I thought was
interesting but for the eyeshadow
palette which we're focusing on in this
video the launch is a September 28th it
says the brand will have a secret
presale on their website I'm not sure if
that is for everything or if they're
doing that differently as well and then
Pat McGrath can also be found at Sephora
so I will go ahead and try to put in any
of the best photos that I can find for
these a shuttle pilots I am reading from
the trend mid-1 Instagram like usual in
these videos so I also will have her
Instagram linked down below so I can
tell you right after that that I'm not
going to be purchasing any of these
eyeshadow palettes at $125 that price
tag is just not practical for me right
now I have actually not tried out any of
the Pat McGrath makeup so it's not a
brand that I am super loyal to I feel
like the brain is stuffed on getting
more and more hype as of lately which is
you know totally awesome but I don't
feel like I've ever seen someone be like
you absolutely must run out and get this
as a bum it's the greatest it's one of
my favorite products because I actually
have no wanting to purchase an action up
palette from Natasha de Nonna
as she got expensive eyeshadow palettes
and even though it is recommended to me
so much and everybody is saying that I
should get it and I see
so many people using the natasha Donora
eye shadows I still have not been able
to fork over the 129 dollars for her
eyeshadow palettes so I wouldn't be able
at all to justify 125 dollars for you
know something that I don't feel like I
have really been sold on myself of
course everything I'm saying is just for
myself I feel like I have not been sold
on the Pat McGrath brand enough to be
able to buy it for a hundred and
twenty-five dollars regret the prices
are always very high I mean it's you
know high-end luxury makeup prices
health definitely look very interesting
but not again just not enough for me to
be able to spend that much money on it's
just it's just something that's not
practical for me so I know that I will
be passing over the Pat McGrath
eyeshadow palettes but I would love to
know like do you want to sell me on the
brand do you have a bunch of items from
the Pat McGrath brand that you
absolutely love and that you totally
recommend did you see these eyeshadow
palettes and you knew right away that
you wanted to get them I would love to
know any feedback because like I said I
just don't hear a ton about the brand
besides the releases like I say trend
would post about the release and I see a
couple of the big bloggers that get the
PR packages I see them talking about it
but I feel like I don't see a lot of
other people talking about the releases
and reviewing them so that's why I just
can't depart with that amount of money
for the Pat McGrath products right now
but let us know in the comments down
below if you have anything from Pat
McGrath or if these eyeshadow palettes
caught your attention so next up I got
tagged on a couple of different
foundations the first one is from NARS
it's their Velvet Matte a foundation
stick it comes in 20 different shades
which will match the regular foundation
shades says it's a sheer medium coverage
a matte finish long wear sweat-resistant
says one side is the foundation the
other side has a replaceable removable
touchable lender
there are $45 each they are permanent
they will be available September 1st on
the NARS website and boutiques and other
stores so I have been on just I mean
it's it's got a little out of hand my
foundation problem I keep getting new
foundations I keep trying them out I'm
having an absolute fantastic time trying
out all these different foundations I
don't know what happened I don't know
what happened but I've all of a sudden
just gone on a huge foundation kick I
have
the new estee lauder double wire water
foundation i purchased it from ulta a
couple weeks ago and i've been testing
it out for review that's what I have on
today I've just been I've just been
loving on foundations lately that being
said I understand that I have a problem
right now and I need to like reel it in
with foundations or I need to do a
foundation declutter or I need to do
something because my foundations are
legitimately scattered all over my
office I had like one little cute spot
for all of my foundations and then
something happened and now they're just
everywhere so I definitely don't need
any more foundation at this moment I
need to be testing out everything that I
have bought so I can be reviewing and
all of that good stuff so I know that I
need to say no to the NARS foundation I
am very in to stick foundations right
now I definitely am but I actually just
got a new one from Lancome I believe is
their 10t dull stick foundation I have
that and I haven't even opened it yet I
mean I only just got like two days ago
but I need to be trying out that one so
I just I know I don't need to get this
one the sheer medium coverage has me a
bit interested I bet it would be a
foundation that I would like just by
reading I'm not sure I really understand
the whole touch blender on the other
side I kind of I don't know I kind of
find it just a little bit gimmicky I
feel like that's something I would
probably like never reach for you know I
have my beauty sponges and I have my
brushes that I love so I don't know I
think that's a little bit weird but as
much as foundation is just catching my
eye lately and I like want to try it all
I know that's just not a possibility for
me right now so I'm gonna skip over the
NARS foundation wouldn't say that I'm
loyal to NARS in any way I think the
only products I have from NARS are ones
that either like came in a set like I
have a lipstick that came in and give me
some nude set and I have an eyeshadow
that came and some other Sephora
favorites that that I purchased I don't
think I don't think I have ever bought
anything from NARS myself so go ahead
and skip over that foundation especially
knowing how many other foundations
continually keep catching my attention I
know that I should only go for the ones
that like really truly like hold my
interest and they're still one from
Smashbox I talked about that a couple
weeks back in a wilayat video still have
that
one on my wish list and I'm thinking is
still about picking that one up so it
comes to making makeup decisions you I
really want to go for those ones that
make me do a double-take that make me
really want it I like the brand etc etc
versus one that doesn't really check any
of those categories so I'm gonna skip
over the NARS stick foundation so the
next foundation that I was getting a ton
of tags on is from Urban Decay it looks
like they are sending their naked line
and they're coming out with a new
cushion foundation The Naked skin glow
foundation says it's a weightless
buildable coverage with a comfortable
and matte luminous finish matte luminous
keep your skin hydrated for 18 hours has
an SPF of 50 there's only six shades
afford now you will be able to purchase
refills as well has purple holographic
packaging to fit right in with the
holographic trend that's happening right
now I'll have some photos insert it down
below so I found this kind of
interesting it says it's going to launch
September 14th at Sephora and Singapore
it will launch their first and trend
moon said I will update about the u.s.
so if I see that update about the u.s.
I'll go ahead and put it in here but I'm
assuming you know maybe near the end of
September super interesting here I mean
a lot of just kind of interesting claims
with the matte luminous typically it's
either match or luminous and a matte
skin but with a glow I don't know that's
kind of interesting six shades that's
definitely kind of a bummer and that
doesn't sound like any sort of huge
shade range at all I didn't see a price
right now for these again if I have that
I'm just filming the day before or samus
knowing I'm not gonna have that
information but if I do for some reason
I will put it in the video as well but
honestly I just kind of know that I'm
not gonna get it not only did I just
talk about how much foundation I and
buying and have been reviewing and all
of that fun stuff but I just don't think
I'm interested in a cushion foundation
at this time I did try out the cushion
foundation that I will it was from
L'Oreal it was like two years ago maybe
they came out with that cushion
foundation and everyone kind of lost
their minds over it and I went out and
bought it and I really enjoyed it I
actually went through it I went through
a foundation and even you know a year
and a half to two years ago I did not
have a huge
foundation collection and so I you know
had Mike my tried and trued foundations
that are continually used I was shocked
that I went through a foundation
normally what I found then with cushion
foundations is that you just don't get
as much product it definitely gets
harder to get a product out so I just
didn't find for me personally that
cushion foundations really matched with
me yes I enjoyed that foundation but
once I saw how quickly I was going
through it and kind of how hard the
packaging was like I was continually
like digging my nails into that cushion
and flipping it over and flipping it
over and flipping it over so I could
keep trying to get the foundation out
and I just the packaging just ended up
not being one of my favorites I haven't
purchased another cushion foundation
after that I know there's been a few
other cushion foundations that have come
out and from higher end brands but I've
just not had any interest because I just
felt like that packaging really did not
work for me so I know once I saw that I
saw the tanks coming in and I'm like I
know what you guys are thinking because
you know I keep continually saying I
love foundations and I'm trying out all
these new ones but for me I saw that
immediately I was like no I can't say
I'm super interested so I know that I'm
going to be passing over it mostly
because I just don't want a cushion
foundation but also because I don't need
a new foundation right now I've been
trying more from Urban Decay I got a
really amazing PR package from Urban
Decay and then they are now on actively
so I ordered a couple things from my
free store and actually from Urban Decay
I just got the all nighter foundation
I'm going to be testing that one out and
I also have been recently trying their
one and done which I'm super super
impressed with but yeah the cushion
foundation just made me do no sort that
will take I knew immediately that it
wasn't going it to be for me but I would
love to know if you guys have tried out
cushion foundations and they're like
absolutely your favorite you saw this
you got super stoked for it I would love
to know your feedback in the comments
the item that I got the most tags on by
far this week as one that definitely got
my attention these are some new releases
are from NYX Cosmetics they are going to
be releasing the element collection so
they have different eyes shadow palettes
there's the water palette the fire
palette the earth palette the wind
palette the air palette and the metal
palette these are going to be available
September 10th
line and at Ulta beauty and the 24th in
stores I believe they are online already
at the NYX Cosmetics websites that will
have any links that I can down below
they are $30 each and I'm not sure what
I would want to call it I saw it first
actually on the next cosmetics page and
it looks like they have one gal like one
Beauty influencer for each palette they
have these really cool photos on the NYX
Instagram like the water one had crispy
on there the earth one had Samantha
Robin doll the fire one had Karen or I
love Sarah E the metal one had Jamie
Genevieve her had Alyssa Ashley and then
wind had promised hang on there so I
thought that was kind of interesting I
think it's necessarily a collaboration
with the girls because I haven't seen
anything about that I haven't seen that
type of boarding at all but I think it
was really interesting to see some of
these influencers on there especially
ones who like I just I kind of felt like
I was seeing a little bit of different
faces on there you know what I'm saying
about how sometimes you feel like you're
seeing the same people over it over and
over with the brands which it isn't a
bad thing you know allow those people I
really enjoy but I thought it was really
fun when I was going through the NYX
Instagram thing a couple faces that at
least to me I felt like you know it was
kind of getting switched up a little bit
I know Karen was just in the the benefit
one that I talked about a couple weeks
ago so I'll but I thought that was
really neat and and some of these girls
I just started watching here on YouTube
as well Samantha Robin doll being one
and Jamie Genevieve I have those to get
recommend it to me quite a bit and I've
really been enjoying their channels so I
thought that was really neat I'm super
curious about these I am super curious
about these I was super stoked when I
saw them I'm looking at all the swatches
I'm seeing what people have to say the
only thing the only thing that is
holding me back is that these palettes
are $30 $30 for a NYX eyeshadow palette
that is expensive for a NYX eyeshadow
palette Nyx's drugstore what are you
doing why isn't I should repeal it $30
like that's the only thing that is
holding me back that actually really
really surprised me the only part that
is giving me a pause though
that definitely kind of stood out to me
the most was the fire palette it has
kind of those yellows and the Reds in
there reminded me of the Natasha doing
on a sunset palette it reminded me of
the color pop yes please palette neither
pellets that I have that's the one that
I feel like it's sticking out to me the
most the other one that I think looks
really interesting is the earth pellet
it has kind of like these neutrals and
the greens and the Browns and just you
know the shades that I wear a ton
there's a wonderful range in here with
these palettes and I think there's you
know going to be a palette for everybody
there are some cool tones in there there
are some colorful ones there's some
shimmer ones and all of that so I think
that's awesome and I'm super intrigued
by this collection I'm just so pumped at
the price tag I think that is really
high because I would love to be able to
buy a couple of these palettes two or
three of them and do a review and you
know do a couple looks with them and let
you guys know if I think of $30 NYX
eyeshadow palette is worth it but then
at the same time I'm like now I'm gonna
be spending $90 on an eyeshadow palettes
from NYX like that's crazy to me so
honestly I think what I'm gonna do is
just buy one I'm gonna start off with
one and see what I think I think I'm
gonna wait for it to drop out Ulta
because I have like buku all the points
now with that whole ten times platinum
points and I went a little crazy I have
a ton of Ulta points so I'm wanting to
purchase one of the palettes I think I'm
gonna do the fire one just because hey
that was the first one that really made
me do a hardcore double take but be like
I said it reminds me of those two other
palettes that I was not able to have so
I want to be able to review it and give
my feedback because $30 is pretty pricey
for an NYX palette I was not super
impressed at that price tag at all and
hopefully they're good the swatches do
look really good but I haven't seen any
early reviews besides from the gals who
you know appear to be working with NYX
on this collection so I don't know what
would you call that it's not a
collaboration they're the face of it I
don't know what you would call it but
hopefully you guys understand what I'm
saying but those are really the only
people so far at the time I'm filming
that I have seen really talking about
these palettes they just launched I
think yesterday on the next website and
like I said they'll be coming to Ulta on
the 10th so if you guys want to see a
review and you would want to see my
feedback or you want to
tutorial or anything like that please
let me know in the comments down below
because that will really help me out as
well I have to say I'm just I'm very
curious about these something like I
said that just immediately caught my
attention especially with that fire
palette but I really want to see if
these NYX pallets are worth the $30
because I'm curious about it I'm curious
about it myself so I feel like a lot of
you guys are curious and I had an
overwhelming number of tags I mean this
one this week completely beat out all of
the other tags that I got on Instagram
and snapchat a lot of people are super
curious about this one so I think that
is what my plan is going to be for right
now I'm gonna pick up the fire palette
let us know what you thought about this
collection though were you excited to
see it too the $30 count you off guard
as well and which palette are you most
interested in I'd love to know your
thoughts I'd love to know if you'd want
