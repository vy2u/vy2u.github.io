today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my will i buy it videos
every single Wednesday where I talk
about makeup and beauty and brands and
just discuss what I'm gonna be buying
and when I'm not gonna be buying and
kind of why and why not
so like I said I do post my will I buy
it's every single Wednesday and I do
have a playlist with all of my videos so
I'll leave that link down below in case
you are interested I also do post on
Thursdays and then Sundays and Mondays
so I post four times a week so I hope
that you will hit the subscribe button
to become a part of the famine get
notified for when I post my videos but I
typically have a lot to say for my will
I buy up videos so why don't we go ahead
and get started first up I want to talk
about a brand because I'm getting asked
a lot of questions of what do I think
about this brand what would I recommend
from them what do I have from them etc
the brand is the way haircare and I'm
just been getting asked you know what do
I love from them what would I recommend
and I actually don't have anything from
the brand it is a fairly newer brand and
I just haven't purchased anything from
them yet
whey is also sold at Sephora so I'm just
kind of checking out the Sephora website
so Way was started by Jen akan who is a
celebrity hairstylist I was familiar
with her before she started her brand
because I would see her a lot on like
the Kardashians snapchats she would do
like kardashian-jenner her hair so I was
familiar with her and then I saw her
bring this brand out and I thought you
know okay cool and now I definitely see
her in a lot of like other influencers
snaps and you know I see the other like
bigger influencers using the way
haircare so I've definitely been
interested in it but it hasn't been
enough for me to purchase anything yet
because to be honest I'm not like a huge
hair person I'm definitely starting to
get better at it and it's I feel like
it's because I finally have found a
pretty good like hair routine I have
really thin hair also very very damaged
because I started highlighting and
dyeing my hair when I was 14 years old I
was perming my hair at like how old was
I when I got my first perm mom like 10
so I always struggled with really frizzy
hair like unmanageable frizzy I was so
embarrassed
to wear my hair down type of frizzy hair
and it's really been I would say in the
past like four years that I feel like
I've gotten good control over my hair
but because of that I've always like
struggled with hair care one hair care
products tie by and I've just not been a
big hair person because of it because I
always felt like no matter what I was
buying or what I was trying like nothing
was working and I finally feel like I
have come to a good place and honestly
the biggest thing for me I think is what
it was was I stopped washing my hair
everyday I only wash my hair about two
times a week sometimes three times a
week and I think that has really helped
a lot and then I also have basically
stopped using heat on it sometimes I
will curl my hair but I do not ever
blow-dry my hair like do not know the
last time I blow dried my hair I don't
straight my hair I used to straight my
hair every single day in college and I
don't do that anymore so I really do
credit those two things but because of
that I've just not been a big hair
person and now that I feel like I'm
getting my hair to a good place you know
it's still it's definitely still damaged
and I do still highlight my hair so I'm
getting it more into haircare I'm trying
I'm trying to step outside my comfort
zone I'm using things like oils and
mousses and the texture sprays and
things like that and it's I'm definitely
getting more excited when I do my hair
so I've been seeing a lot about this way
brand and what I'm super curious about
at this moment in time I hear a lot
about the wave spray and I also hear
good things about just the shampoo and
conditioner in general but what I'm
really curious about is the dry shampoo
foam so it's $28 it's a waterless
cleansing foam to remove oil and product
build-up from dry hair so it's supposed
to refresh your hair between washes
gently cleanse and detangle strands dry
shampoo is definitely a big thing for me
because I only wash my hair twice a week
sometimes when I get on day like three
hair sometimes I'll stretch it a day for
hair but some when I get to like the
three and four day I definitely need a
dry shampoo and I've never felt like I
have found a joy I shampoo that I would
repurchase like I've tried different dry
shampoos and they've always just been ok
for me I've never found that one that
I'm like this is my dry shampoo I'm
always gonna repurchase this I need to
have this
haven't found that one yet and I was
watching desi Perkins snapchat I think
it was desi and she used this foam not
only was it like you know it was a dry
shampoo but it also gave her like a ton
of volume and I was like what is like a
really thin hair I'm always looking to
try to get more volume and like ever
since then now I'm seeing like everybody
talk about this dry shampoo and I'm like
do I need to get it so I'm pretty sure
I'm going to purchase this dry shampoo
foam I guess that it's $28 and you get
five point three ounces of product in
case you're curious I have it on my
love's list in my Sephora account and
the next time I place an order with
Sephora I plan on picking it up but I
also wanted to ask you guys like I like
to do a my will I have videos when I'm
talking about brands that I'm not
familiar with the other I haven't
purchased from yet what do you guys
think of it do you have anything from
wet yet would you recommend anything do
you have this dry shampoo foam do you
suggest it do you say stay away from it
I'm very curious I've never tried
anything from the brain yet but I would
really like to I think starting off with
the one product would be a smart idea
for me and I think dry shampoo would
probably be the best thing because like
I said I use dry shampoo at least once a
week if not twice a week depending on
how many times I'm washing my hair and
just kind of what my hair looks like I'm
on day two hair or day three here right
now I think I'm on day day two hair I
don't know I don't remember I'm
definitely curious to get your guys's
thoughts
I feel like this brand is becoming more
and more hyped I think it probably is
because of the celebrity hair style a
spike the Kardashian aspect but now we
have the big in who ones there's aspect
to and sometimes it can be a little bit
hard to tell what's just hype and what's
hype because it's good so I would love
to get your guys's opinions and feedback
on away hair care so please leave me
some comments down below let me know
what you think of it
but I hope to be getting of the
direction of poof ohm very soon it's
just asked on my snapchat the night
before I'm filming this if I was going
to be buying this new product and I
immediately had to run Instagram because
I was like I didn't even know about it
that's why I really enjoy making these
vilifying videos and having you guys
comment and tag me on Instagram and snap
me and let me know what you want me to
talk about because like this is how
finding new products now's because of
you guys but I believe it was Sandra
Marie that asked me on snapchat if I was
going to be buying the prismatic
amethyst Becca cosmetics a shimmering
skin perfecter pressed highlighter okay
so we got a new highlighter from Becca
called the prismatic amethyst I'm
looking at the trend with one Instagram
page and it says it's a purple lavender
vibe type of highlighter with a pinkish
shift okay so it's gonna be available
exclusively for Sephora VIP Rouge
members February 14th so it should
already be for sale at the time this
video goes up if it's not already sold
out and then online at Becca cosmetics
and Sephora February 22nd and then in
stores in March enriched with dual
chrome pigments that reflect and refract
light for multi-dimensional radiance the
stunning iridescent lavender highlights
subtly shifts the shades as it catches
the light and it's $38 so it looks so
stunning
like it looks beautiful like the purple
lavender pink kind of iridescent
swatches that I'm seeing they look
fantastic they look so lovely I'm I'm
gonna pass over this one though mostly
because I just got a lot of highlights
if you guys saw the pixie pretties
collab unboxing video that I did I got
the most like amazing PR package from
pixie Beauty they just did a collab with
for beauty gurus and I got to individual
highlighters they also sent they have a
collab with Miriam NYC and her palettes
what is there like four different
highlight shades or like five different
allergies it's a lot of it like I just
got a lot of highlight and I'm actually
not so much a highlight junkie like I
used to be when the highlight Crace is
kind of coming out I was like all about
highlights I was like give me all the
highlights and I was buying a lot for a
while and I started dealing with bad
texture on my face and the highlight
accentuate that texture I know I talked
about this I think it was in my last
anti haul video and I got some really
good comments and feedback on skincare
to try that helps with texture so thank
you guys so much I wrote
everything down it just kind of has me
not wearing highlight on a daily basis
and you know if I'm gonna be buying a
high-end product or spending a little
bit more money on a product I want it to
be something that I feel like I'm gonna
get a really regular use out of and
highlight is not that for me right now
you know I don't wear makeup every day
but then even when I do wear makeup I'm
not hiding the highlight every single
day it kind of just depends on what my
face is feeling and well the face it
looks like if I'm gonna wear highlight
so for $38 I don't I mean definitely
it's more expensive its high-end it's
Becca cosmetics honestly when I look at
this I think it would be really pretty
on the lids to Laura's like the inner
corner highlight so there's definitely
more functions that you can get out of a
highlight shade like a highlight she
doesn't just have to be a highlight
shade I wear my highlights as eyeshadows
I've worn eyes shadow as highlights so
you know there's definitely different
things that you can do with it but just
spend just $38 on one product that I
won't get regular use out of I don't
think it makes sense to me but seriously
like if you're a hardcore like Becca fan
or you're a hardcore highlight fan this
shade looks super super beautiful it was
hard for me to say no to it honestly was
and I had to think about it and process
it for a while and I was looking at all
the different swatches but I just know
that I'm not gonna get enough use out of
it and especially like I said with all
of the highlights that were just sent to
me like that's what I'm wearing and
that's what I'm trying out and I just
know that it wouldn't get enough love
from me so I'm gonna pass over the new
Becca highlight it looks so pretty but
I'm gonna pass over and I know it's the
best thing to do right now so let me
know in the comments down below the of
course are you gonna pick up the new
better highlight are you gonna pass over
it what do you think I would love to
know there's a product that I really
want to talk about because I found it
apparently Benefit Cosmetics has a new
spring/summer collection that they're
about to release and again looking at
trend moods Instagram they have a new
blush coming out which is called
California they have a new highlight
coming out which is called dandelion
twinkle but then what gets me really
excited it says the oh there's also a
face palette can't forget that a new
face palette is coming and there
the hula family is getting bigger
there's a new bronzer in hula light
which is for a fair skin tone and
there's also a hoola contour stick and I
want to talk about the contour stick I
don't want to talk about the full
collection yet because there isn't a ton
of information yet and there's really
not I mean myself the all morning I've
been trying to find stuff on this I
haven't been able to find a lot of
swatches or seeing what the products
look like yet so I'm just gonna talk
about the contour stick if you guys want
to see more about the benefit full
collection let me know in the comments
down below and I can talk about it once
I see more information coming in but the
contour stick got me so excited
I love contouring I feel like sometimes
the things that I get excited over
people are like really like I love you
know eyeshadows and blushes and
highlighters and I'm over here like I
love eyeliner and contour and bronzer
people are like what is wrong with you
at least I'm a lipstick junkie because I
feel like I fit in there but like those
are the things that give me excited but
I've been so into contour cream
contouring bronzing like that is what
I'm just like truly obsessed with right
now so I got really excited to see this
the hoola bronzer I haven't I think it's
amazing
I love the hoola bronzer it's one of
those like cult favorites I would say
like kind of everybody loves it type of
thing not ever you know okay some I try
not to say everybody loves it because I
know that's not possible but even before
I got on YouTube I knew to have the
hoola bronzer like I knew that that was
a much-loved product so to see it in a
contour stick and a cream contour I'm
just like I'm just over here like so
excited and as I was doing my research
and trying to find information on it it
actually is already available in some
international markets I believe I found
it on like benefit France website it was
already for sale there and they're
saying on some I think it was maybe a
Sephora France as well that it's already
available trend mood is saying maybe
like February March for the collection
to drop but I haven't seen anything else
about it
I followed the benefit snapchat I
thought I saw something about their
blush the California brush blush the
gala fornia blush I thought I saw
something about that on their snapchat
but I didn't see anything about these
contour sticks yet so I really hope that
they talk about them soon and give us
date and on the benefit France website
it was $30 in euros not dollars but
euros and I did the calculations and it
was like 31 79 to US dollars so I'm
assuming the the contour stick will be
somewhere around $30 as well to me
that's a little bit pricey for just a
contour but I like benefit
I love contouring I contour and bronze
on like a daily basis like even if I'm
doing very very simple makeup like even
if I'm not even putting foundation on
like I'm just putting like a tinted
moisturizer on I still contour and
bronze because I love it that's what I
like to do so that's where I can justify
spending my money on something you know
it's a little bit more high-end it's a
little bit like ooh you know yeah that's
kind of pricey but I know I'm gonna get
a lot of use out of it that's kind of
how I think about it that's why I like
making these videos is kind of
explaining and just showing that you
know we don't need to buy everything we
don't need to feel the pressure to buy
everything and to kind of stop and think
about okay I'm not gonna wear a
highlight every day should I spend the
money on the highlight no but I am gonna
contour of all station I spend my money
on the country yes
like that's why I like making these
videos and I just think it's fun and
interesting to see what other people you
know what they want to spend their money
on to and you know what you're the
advocates of I just think it's so cool
and interesting but I'm all about this
contour stick I'm really excited for it
I'm gonna keep watching I'm gonna keep
seeing when it comes out because I
definitely plan on picking it up super
pumped about it so yeah I wanted to talk
about that let me know what you guys
think about the contour stick do you
like hoola do you plan on getting the
stick as well have you heard about it
yet like was I the last one to hear
about this because I couldn't believe it
I'm like no way I'm always on watching
benefit snapchat with ginger and I hear
about this yet but if you want to see
more from the benefit spring/summer
collection as well let me know in the
comments and when we have some more info
and photos and all that good stuff I can
talk about it in a future video if you
are interested so I have been getting
asked so much about the lorac spring
collection I've been getting asked for
the past several weeks about the entire
collection and I know a lot of you are
very curious about the eyeshadow palette
in particular so this collection
includes the brunch alter ego lipgloss
which are seventeen dollars each
and then we have the colorsource
buildable blush and highlighter these
are $35 each and then we have the
eyeshadow palette which is 16 shades for
$44 and then we also have the brunch
alter ego lipstick you're going to be
the available February 22nd in stores
and online and this is all limited
edition shoot I didn't notice the
limited edition part okay so to go
through it the lip glosses I know
immediately I'm not gonna buy not a huge
lip gloss person I tend to wear more
liquid lips I'm actually wearing a lip
gloss right now though because it was a
part of the Sephora give me some nude
collection which I'm doing a giveaway
for if you haven't entered yet make sure
to enter but I just I have enough lip
glosses for the amount of times I wear
lip gloss the blush and highlighters I'm
gonna pass over them mostly for what
I've been saying about highlighters I
don't need any in my collection right
now so I'm gonna pass over those and
then the lipsticks I'm gonna pass over
the lipsticks because I don't think the
shades are for me this entire collection
is very pastel obvious I mean I'll
insert the photos here but it's very
very pastel and I'm not a big pastel
lipstick wearer but one thing that I
actually am interested in is the
eyeshadow palette and I was excited to
talk about it because I have not
purchased any of the lorac eyeshadow
palettes yet I've never tried lorac
eyeshadows now they're mega pros not any
of the other eyeshadows that they put
out I've never tried them and it's
because of you guys leaving me in the
comments letting me know how fantastic
you think the lorac eyeshadows are that
I'm like okay what finally see if the
lorac eyeshadow palette that catches my
eye that makes me do a double-take I'm
gonna get it because of you guys this is
your fault
just so you know but when I saw this
pastel eyeshadow come out I was like oh
really now and it's funny because I
think I talked about the Kat Von D
pastel goth palette and I said I wasn't
gonna buy it and I didn't buy it but it
was because all the shades were only the
pastel shades and when you look at this
like there's actually like some
transition state shades like I feel like
I could actually create a whole I look
using just this palette there's a mirror
in it but like some of these pastel
shades like the men
and the pink sand there's a beautiful
orange in there there's a really nice
what looks to be like a blue in there
it just looks really pretty how much is
this again $44 a little pricey it's a
little up there it's a little pricey and
I'm so bummed that it's limited edition
I don't know why I didn't realized that
before does Samantha you should have
known that was gonna be limited edition
I try not to buy too much limited
edition because it's harder to talk
about in the future and when I do
tutorials which I mostly do my tutorials
on Instagram now when I do my makeup
tutorials I try not to use limited
edition because I know not everyone can
get it I think it looks so pretty I
immediately was drawn to it and I also
try to say that in my will I buy at
videos that I try not to convince myself
to buy makeup because there's so much
makeup out there and there's so many
releases happening that I really want to
focus my attention on what does catch my
attention and then go through the
questions of myself do I need this in my
collection am I gonna wear it on a
regular basis is it worth the amount of
times I'm gonna wear it compared to the
price point and go from there so when
this palette made me do a double-take I
was like wait a second
this could be it this could be my first
lorac eyeshadow palette I'm excited for
it I think I'm gonna do it you guys I
think I'm gonna do it now I'm just only
bummed that it's limited edition but
that's okay I still think I could get a
lot of use out of it and I think because
of the pastel shades that are in there I
think it'll be different enough from the
eyeshadows that I have when the palettes
that I have like I feel like I could
justify it I feel like if you really
want to you can justify any makeup
purchase but that's how I'm gonna
justify this one let's know are you guys
going to pick up this one or anything
else from the lorac spring collection
like I said the eyeshadow palette is
gonna be the only thing that I'm going
for I just don't think I'll get enough
use out of the other items in there
beside it about it let me know in the
comments down below what you think and
if you're gonna pick it up and thanks to
you guys for convincing me that I need
to try out lorac I'm excited I'm excited
to give them a try and that's gonna be
everything for this week's delay by a
video now my lighting has gone crazy
because the Sun the Sun disappeared this
one was out for like maybe 10 minutes
and I was like yes natural lighting and
then it's gone so that was a bummer
but thank you guys so much for watching
thank you for continuing to
posted these vilify videos I love just
being able to sit down and talk to you
guys about makeup and when I think about
it and what I want to buy and then
