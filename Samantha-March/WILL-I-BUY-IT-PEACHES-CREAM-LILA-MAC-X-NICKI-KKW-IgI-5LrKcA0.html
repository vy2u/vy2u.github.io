today's video is going to see a new will
I buy it I post my bill I buy videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about some new makeup releases and
lunches letting you know a little bit
about them and then letting you know if
I'm going to be picking them up or
passing over them like I said I do post
these videos every single Wednesday so I
will have my will I buy a playlist that
link down below in case you are
interested and catching up on my past
videos but as always I have a lot to
talk about in my will advice videos so
why don't we go ahead and get started so
a lot of people were asking about this
k'kaw beauty product before the it even
went on sale and I just kept not talking
about it a lot of times I touch on some
of these items that like I feel really
passionately against in the anti haul
video but I have decided to put my anti
hauls on hold I will invite serious was
kind of a spinoff from the anti haul
videos and when I turned it into a
weekly series I kind of put the anti
house on hold but they kept being
requested so I started to do the anti
hauls but I post a will I buy a video
every single Wednesday and I think I'm
gonna do twice a month I'm gonna post my
wish list or won't touch which is gonna
be all about new holiday releases that's
a pretty similar format to the will I
buy it so I thought if I can do a
monthly anti haul as well it's just as
kind of a lot of the same content at
times I was saving some of these
products from brands or just products in
general that I know I wouldn't love and
I was kind of saving them for an anti
haul because I know a lot of people kind
of like the will I buy it because they
think it's a like more suspenseful is
what I've read in the comments like
people get curious about it and with
some of these items people who have been
following my channel for a while kind of
already know and I touched on this and
last week's will I buy a video that if
you're new here maybe you don't know my
thoughts on Kim Kardashian west or the
k'kaw beauty line so I'm just gonna go
ahead and kind of put the anti hauls on
hold for right now but to talk about the
new release from at k'kaw Beauty she's
coming out with a new powder contour and
highlighting kit and it does include a
brush there's three different kids and
each cos are going to be fifty two
dollars so in each palette you get two
bronzing slash contour powders and two
highlighter they already did go for sale
I think the week before I am filming
this will i buy it video did sell out
and all I'm seeing right now is that the
Reese Ock Day is coming soon if I have
by the tennis videos going live I can
insert it into the description box like
I mentioned how I would typically put
this in that anti howl that means that I
am not buying this contour and highlight
kit so I don't really support Kim
kardashian-west and her makeup ventures
I didn't really understand it a lot kind
of her whole for right into the beauty
industry has left a really bad taste in
my mouth
you can feel whatever it is that you
want to feel about Kim kardashian-west
and her makeup line and that's totally
fine but for my personal opinion I just
really wasn't super into it and just
some of the things that I see on her
snapchat her videos and her snaps about
her makeup line and I'm like deep-water
why did you decide that you wanted to do
this because half the time she's like I
don't know how to do makeup I don't know
what this is I don't know why I'm doing
this I'm like then why are you doing it
do something that you are passionate
about if you're not passionate about
makeup why did you create a makeup line
because I made your little sister like
it's going to make kylie jenner a
billionaire within like four years or
something like that it's projected to me
or maybe it's even less than that I see
those things I'm like I don't know why
you're doing this then it's just kind of
like it just weirds me out and I saw her
first release with Kim kardashian-west
beauty it was the cream contour and
highlight sticks and and watching
people's videos on that was like
actually pretty comical about how much
people really despised it and it seemed
like the only people that did really
enjoy it were those that were invited to
Kim kardashian-west party and those that
are doing makeup tutorials now with Kim
kardashian-west on YouTube which that
also leaves a really bad taste in my
mouth I really wish that would stop
happening snot my vibe it just her whole
beauty line just gives me bad vibes it I
don't like it at all seeing the reviews
come in on her first product seeing how
little product you got for how much
money you're paying seeing them break
seeing them not work it just no I've
only seen a couple videos so far of
people using this powder contour bronzer
highlight Palin my biggest thing is that
I just don't want to support her or her
brand I just I'm just not interested at
this time in supporting that it just if
something leaves me with a bad vibe and
if I look at something and I just feel
like kind of ache all over
why would I then depart with $52 for it
that wouldn't really make a lot of sense
I have passed over the new Kim
kardashian-west highlight bronzer
contour talent but I would love to know
if you guys got it what you thought
about it did you pick up the first
release for you into it not so much do
you have my feelings about Kim
kardashian-west and her beauty line or
are you so excited about
millions and millions of fans so I'm
sure some of you watching this are so
I'd love to hear your thoughts on you
know if you're excited about it and if
you want to get it and what you want to
see her come out with next just some
comments down below try to keep it kind
but I like to hear everybody's opinions
as long as they're you know somewhat
humane that's always good but for me it
just is not for me the brand is not for
me right now I'd rather support other
businesses other brands other
entrepreneurs other hustlers and these
just are not for me so next time I got a
lot of tags about this on Instagram and
I think I know why this is a new
collaboration between emaki cosmetics
and nicki minaj nicki minaj is a rapper
so I feel like Mac really comes out with
a lot of collaborations with a lot of
different people and different types of
people like it's kind of wild how many
collaborations Mac does it's kind of
hard to keep up with but I got a lot of
tags on this one because it is a full
nude lipstick collection and I'm like
yeah I get I get what you guys text me
I'll batter our lipsticks and then also
lip glasses that's like the Mac lip
gloss there is multiple different shades
in here looks like they are all $17.50
each will be available September 21st
online and in select stores of so this
is very interesting
I do like me some nudes I do like Nicki
Minaj I don't know if you guys know this
about me but I also consider myself to
be kind of like a right
superstar I know you might not that you
know mind might not be your first guess
about me but I do feel like I have some
rep skills would not have guessed that
she would be doing a collaboration with
Matt cosmetics but it is what it is
can't say I'm super shocked to see a
bunch of nudes in here as well 17:50
each for some lipsticks they're in the
amplified finish this collection I
definitely gave me a double take not
only because it's with Nicki Minaj I
wasn't expecting that but it also gave
me a double take because I love nude
lipsticks I love nudes they are my
favorite to wear they are my favorite to
buy and I just can't help it I'm
definitely a nude lipstick lover that
being said I think I can say with
confidence that I'm gonna go ahead and
pass over this collection because I just
don't need more nude lipsticks right now
I don't need lipsticks in general but I
don't need any more nude lipsticks and
unless I feel like really passionately
about something I want to hold off at
something that I really truly want and
like feel like I'd be super sad if I
didn't get I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over it we have the holidays coming up
which is super crazy to think about like
holiday makeup releases and also the
also 21 days of beauty is coming up I'm
that sale like crazy so we will see so
if something doesn't catch my attention
if it's not something that I'm like I
truly need that I'm gonna be super
bummed if I didn't get it I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over it so I'm gonna pass
over everything from the Mac and Nicki
Minaj's collection but let us know were
you super excited for this were you
surprised when you saw the collab are
you gonna pick up any of the nudes
listen and oh mine did I get a lot of
tags on this and I was actually on a
camping trip all week I lost internet
last week at my house and so I was
already kind of like being pretty spotty
on social media and then I went camping
and basically didn't have a phone at all
for an entire weekend I came back and it
was like so many tags on this I was so
shocked to see this myself when I went
to the trend mood Instagram I was like
wait a second what Natacha de Nona is
going to be releasing a new eyeshadow
palette I know I know I don't know so
this is going to be the lila palette to
be 129 dollars it's going to be
permanent which is super
siding let's see so it is going to be
available on September 12 online at
Sephora and Beauty lish and September
15th in stores oh no like oh man oh man
obviously I will insert a picture in
here of the Lila palette from Natasha to
Nona but this looks so pretty I just see
that the sunset palette is coming back
as well and that it will be permanent
also and that's still one hundred and
twenty nine dollars so I'm kind of like
I'm kind of like torn now between sunset
and the Lila palette the y la palette
looks gorgeous it looks perfect for fall
it looks beautiful the shimmer shades I
hear so many good things about Natasha -
Nonna I had the sunset palette on my
makeup wishlist it's like come on
Natasha - Nonna what are you doing to us
this looks beyond beautiful
I want it I want it I want it but will I
buy it that's really hard to say because
129 dollars for an eyeshadow palette is
something that I still get very hung up
on and when I've talked about Natasha's
Nonna in the past there's been a lot of
people that have been like let me break
it down for you and they do all the math
in the comments and I appreciate that so
much and I totally get it if you can
break it down and you can do all these
great things and you know a lot of
people are like and if you order on
Beauty Loesch it you can you know just
make monthly payments tour your order
you don't have to pay it all up front
and again I get it but it's still the
concept the thought of paying 129
dollars for one piece of makeup is
really hard for me to comprehend and
it's really hard for me to be like that
sounds like a good idea it's just a lot
of money at one time it's a lot of money
for one piece of makeup it's a lot do I
want the Lila palette from Natasha to
Donna yes do I want the sunset palette
for an attachment on yes do I want
anything from Natasha - no no yes but am
I gonna buy it
as of right now my guess is probably a
no feel like once that September date
comes around I still feel like it's
always be really really difficult for me
to be like this is a good idea this is a
smart purchase there's a lot of things
that I could spend a hundred and twenty
nine dollars on right now there's a lot
of other things not even makeup related
just life in general that I could spend
$129 on or put towards something a
little bit more expensive so I don't
think that I can do it
did I get so excited when I saw this
palette I do a freaking triple take out
this palette yes I think it looks
beautiful I would love to have it I
would love to be able to purchase it
with like no guilty conscience no
nothing just yep this is what I'm
getting but I just I I can't I just
can't I wish I could I wish I could but
I I don't think that one's gonna be in
the cards for me keep my practical side
on a higher volume than mine on
practical I just want all of the make up
side and and I think I'm gonna be able
to keep the volume turned up on this
side and say no it looks beautiful I'm
not gonna judge anybody if that's what
you want and you want to spend one
hundred and $29 so I shall appellate I
will never judge anybody for what they
want to spend their money on because
it's your money and you could do what
you want to do but for me I think I'm
gonna have to say that I'm not gonna buy
this oh I love how that from Natasha to
Nona it looks so gorgeous I'm so excited
to see the reviews and see the makeup
looks that people come up with but I
don't think it's going to be in my of a
palette collection come September item
that I want to talk about is actually
going to be a new collection oh boy I'm
gonna run through the collection quickly
and then talk about one item from the
collection more in depth I'm gonna be
talking about the Too Faced peaches and
cream collection we have known for a
long time now that Too Faced is going to
be releasing this peaches and cream
collection Too Faced does this thing
where they let us know like months and
months and months in advance when new
stuff is coming out and then we just
have to keep waiting and waiting and
waiting and I'm not really sure I
understand that tactic I don't like when
we get told like something is releasing
and we've had no prior knowledge to it
but how they kind of drag on their
releases it's just weird to me but it's
it's that time it is finally at that
time for peaches and cream for some of
these items from the collection to be
going before sale so I'm gonna run
the full collection just give my brief
thoughts on each thing and then I'm
going to talk about the eyeshadow
palette a little bit more in depth visit
that one in particular I've gotten the
most amount of pegs ons but the entire
collection it's all peach themed of
course there's gonna be a peach blur
magic blurring powder for $30 there's
also going to be at the Just Peachy
level at matte eyeshadow palette which
is $45 with 12 matte shades there's
going to be a sweep hi
radiant matte bronzer for $30 peach
perfect mattifying loose setting powder
for $32 the primed and peachy cooling
matte perfecting primer $32 peach
perfect comfort matte foundation $36 the
peach mist $32 it's a mattifying setting
spray me the bronze peach creamy bronzer
plus peach frost a creamy highlighter
for 30 dollars peach my cheeks melting
powder blush $30 peach kiss moisture
matte long wear lipstick $21 in 20
shades the full collection is going to
be available August 31st online and at
Sephora and in stores September
exclusive to US and Canada only two
things that actually somewhat caught my
attention was the peach perfect comfort
matte foundation for $36 I just like
foundation I like trying different
foundations I'm definitely on a
foundation kick right now I keep buying
foundations and trying new foundations
but because of that I also have a lot of
new foundations I'm trying to get their
new foundations to review new
foundations so why would I buy a new
foundation I don't need to a lot of the
collection is just not for me
if you are not familiar with my channel
and my past videos I've actually been on
a break with Too Faced I have not
purchased anything from Too Faced since
they're white chocolate chip palette I
really just like that palette and it
just really is kind of what like Tim's
me over the edge with Too Faced I was
just feeling really underwhelmed by the
releases a lot of items seem to be very
subpar they just came to be coming out
like just churning out products at such
a fast rate but the quality is not there
I have seen it myself because I've tried
new products I watched the reviews I've
talked to my friends about him a lot of
that I am NOT interested in I will say
that I should've elet caught my
attention it
my attention months ago when we saw the
eyeshadow palette come out it caught my
attention months ago it still kind of
has my attention right now it's $45 for
12 different shades I can't remember off
the top of my head how many shades are
in the sweet peach palette but that
palette was like $49 I mean that palette
is much bigger this this little palette
looks like a little square whereas the
you know the sweet peach one was like
the longer tin and that was only four
dollars more so I feel like the $45 to
me that feels like a pretty high price
it made me do a double-take because I
like these types of colors I like these
types of shades I really enjoy my sweet
peach palette I continually reach for it
even now that you know I'm not
boycotting Too Faced I'm not not using
Too Faced products because I am I like
the sweet peach palette I like their
bronzers there's items from Too Faced
that I do enjoy I'm just not buying
anything new from them at this time that
being said I honestly kind of wondered
like oh maybe this will be the items
that gets me to buy something new from
Too Faced because I enjoyed the sweet
peach palette I enjoyed these shades
there are my kind of colors I feel like
I could get a lot of use out of this but
I don't think it's going to be I think
the $45 I feel like that price tag is
high and that doesn't impress me to know
that my sweet piece was 49 and it came
with more shades and more varieties and
it was just a bigger palette in general
I'm not super impressed with that but
again I just kind of wonder how the
quality is going to be on this
collection I'll be very curious I'll be
curious to watch the reviews I know Too
Faced sends out a ton of PR packages
though I will be watching the review
videos I'll be seeing what people have
to say if there's a lot of really good
feedback on the peach palette I honestly
might buy it just so I can try it out
for myself I have always said that even
though I'm not buying from Too Faced
right now and I consider us to be on a
break that I'm not against purchasing
from them in the future
I like to think of myself as pretty
open-minded especially when it comes to
something as small as makeup and buying
makeup I like to think that I'm pretty
open-minded and a lot of times you hear
me say I'm not interested in supporting
right now I'm not interested in buying
from this brand at this time it doesn't
mean that that's forever and that I will
never purchase from them when a brand
like 2-faced comes out with something
I am actually interested in that did
make me do a double-take that I think I
could use on a regular basis I'm
interested in it I'm not interested
enough to go ahead and wait in crazy
lines and you know all the things that
happened with the prior peach collection
that came out that really made a lot of
people very upset I'll go ahead I'll
watch the reviews I will see what people
have to say and if there's a lot of
really good feedback I would be
interested in picking it up and try it
out for myself and maybe you know to
face and I can start rebuilding our
relationship maybe we can I'll open to
it we gotta save two faces open to it so
that's kind of my thoughts in the
collection a lot of it was just a lot of
his just stuff I don't need I also kind
of wish they would have done something
different than peaches because we've
already got peaches from them so I'm
like why are you going back to this but
I don't know I would like to get your
guys's thoughts of course as always on
the peaches and cream collection if
there's anything that caught your
attention did what I say about the
eyeshadow palette surprise anybody you
know cuz I'm not saying that I am gonna
buy it and the day that it releases I'm
gonna be there
trying to buy it I'm not but I am saying
that I'm open to it I'm willing to give
it a try if other people tell me that it
is like the you know what used to be
really good quality eyeshadow palettes
from Too Faced I know a lot of people
like those chocolate bar palette the
original chocolate bar the semi-sweet
all of those people really enjoyed those
and so when they started to come out
with these subpar palettes a lot of
people were incredibly disappointed
myself being one of them so you know
we'll see are you gonna be one of those
that are buying the palette right away
because if you are I sure hope you tell
me your thoughts on it and if you think
it's worth me to depart my $45 with to
give it a try so most of your thoughts
on the collection I'm curious to know I
think a lot of you have some strong
thoughts on it from what I've seen from
the comments on Instagram and also some
of the snapchats that are coming in but
let us know I want to hear your thoughts
again so that is everything for this
week's with live a video hopefully my
lighting wasn't too crazy it's super
dark once again I think it is going to
storm so I didn't have to bust out my
ring light which I know can make my
lighting kind of crazy typically I just
work off of natural light but hopefully
my lighting wasn't too bad and hopefully
you were still able to enjoy this week's
will I buy it
always let me know what you thought in
the comments down below let me know what
you want to see in next week's will i
