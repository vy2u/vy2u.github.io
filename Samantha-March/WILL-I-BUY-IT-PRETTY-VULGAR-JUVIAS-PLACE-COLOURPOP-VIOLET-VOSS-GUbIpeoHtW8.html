so today's video is going to be a new
will I buy it as you plus my bias videos
every single Wednesday I'm talking about
some new makeup releases and letting you
know if I'm going to be purchasing them
and then why are why not kind of my
opinions and feedback on the product I
guess I do posted videos every single
Wednesday I do have a Willa diet
playlist so I will leave that link down
below I also post on Thursdays Sundays
and Mondays so you do get videos from me
a four times a week so I hope that you
will consider hitting that subscribe
button
and becoming part of the fans get
notified when I post my videos but with
my will in my videos I do always have a
lot to talk about so why don't we go
ahead and get into it you want to say I
apologize if my lighting is kind of
strange I am filming was light today and
it took me so long to like try to set up
the lights because I do not have that
down yet I usually just so most natural
light but we have a lot of rainy days in
the forecast and I'm actually getting a
wisdom tooth removed the day after this
video goes live I'm getting it removed
Thursday afternoon so I'm going to be
out of commission for a few days and of
course our forecast for Thursday and
then next weekend is all funny and
through like the next five days is
alright in some like I have to figure
this out because I didn't want to miss a
video so apologies if my lighting is a
little bit off today but the first item
that I wanted to talk about is from
violet box I feel like I'm talking about
pilot box a lot lately in these will and
BIOS videos but they are coming out with
a lot of new items so they are coming
out with the rose gold highlighter
palette it's going to be $45 for six
extra large highlighter pans it will be
available on May 4th at 10 a.m. PST I
will have that link down below in case
you are interested in picking these up
so for this rose gold highlighter mmm so
you guys know I keep saying that I don't
need any more highlighters I have added
a lot of new highlighters to my
collection
and even though I keep saying I do not
need any more highlighters I freaking
wait and bought one during this tutorial
yourself
I know if you haven't seen at my haul
video I did just get that one posted so
I will have that link down below but I
was like I know I don't need new
highlighters but I still bought it
anyway so now I really need to like
stand firm there are six different
shades and a few like in the pan and
even yeah even swatched they do kind of
look very similar to one another I will
have some photos insert it in here as
well they do look a bit similar to one
another so but I really like the rose
gold tones to it there's one purl one
and then the other ones are all very
much like the rose gold gold peach kind
of tones it looks like from the swatches
pinky tone silk I'm almost kind of
having my eye of those more a little bit
recently I just think they're kind of
fun and different and unique milk makeup
just came out with like a new
holographic highlight stick and it's
kind of like a pink iridescent shift and
I've been really enjoying wearing that
one so those are kind of the highlight
tones that I feel like I'm reaching for
more and more lately but even though I
think it's really pretty I didn't quite
do the double tunic you guys know I'd
say if a product makes me do a
double-take then I'll seriously consider
it if it doesn't make me do a
double-take I just move on I wouldn't
say it was like a full like double take
but it was like a like a side eye I did
like the side ideally do I need that but
I know that I don't I'm going to pass
over it but it is really pretty 45
dollars for six shades now it's kind of
expensive because I compared a lot to
Anasazi and herb Wilkins and for the six
pan Nicole highlight shade I paid $40 so
and I want to say Aurora and moonchild
were right were they the $40 as well so
$45 you know a little bit more expensive
so that is the rose gold Heather palette
from violet boss I'll have it linked
down below are you guys going to get
this I was able to try out violent Vox
recently their eyeshadow palette the
Holy Grail really really enjoyed it but
I just know that I do not need a new
highlighter palette right now at all so
I'm definitely passing over it but I
would love to know if you guys are
planning to get this one did you sign
iron did you double take it did it not
make you have any feelings at all let us
know in the comments down below
so I started very recently getting a
couple tags on this one on Instagram
dubious place is coming out with some
blush palette they're coming out with
two different Sahara blush palette
there's a volume 1 and a volume 2 looks
like a volume one as for medium deep
skin tones volume 2 is for light medium
skin tones so I will try to insert the
best photos that I can
down here so they will be available on
May 10th I did not see a price if I do
see a price by the time this video goes
live I will have it in the description
box down below again any information
that I can't say in a way I buy it video
will be in the description box
I was linking everything in the
description box I put what I'm wearing
in the description box a mom my job is
on the description box all of that is in
there so you can always go ahead and
check the description box for any of
that information but I am trying to pre
film because of my wisdom tooth
extraction that is coming up so I do not
have the president yet but it will be
available on May 10th there are always
some 10% discount codes with dubious
place that you can use I'm looking at
the trend moon Instagram right now and
her coupon code is trendy mood so I'll
have that listed down below as well in
case you really want to get your hands
on this palette I definitely would
suggest using a coupon code because like
why not I know right away that I'm going
to pass over this because I just do not
need a blush palette at this moment I
said before that I'm not a huge like
blush junkie and I always get asked
whenever I say I'm not a junkie and
something people ask me what I am a
junkie so before you can ask the
question I will let you know at this
current moment what I am a junkie I am
always a lipstick junkie that is just
like hands down what I absolutely love
to buy I love to buy makeup brushes I
love to buy skincare I recently was
welcomed into the eyeshadow palette
junkie club thank you so much I in that
now and recently I'm starting to be a
foundation junkie I'm like really
interested in trying a lot of different
foundations and I'm just all about it
even though I'm not even wearing
foundation today I'm just wearing a BB
cream so there's that so I'm just I'm
definitely not a blush junkie at this
moment I might be next month we have no
idea my preferences are always changing
like I'm a bronzer and contour junkie
yeah
concealer I love concealer I'm all about
concealer concealer is one thing that
like it will not leave my house like
sealer an eyeliner like why aren't
people actually why I'm not a junkie of
things if I just say I'm not a blush
junkie I just name like 5 million things
I'm a junkie oh just got B cheek palette
from the new lorac empires of the
Caribbean collection I do have a full
collection video from that collection of
lorac scented to me which is like the
most My Blood thing in the entire world
so I leave that video link down below
but in there cheek palette they have
what was it four different highlighters
in two different blushes so I know
that I don't need to absolute is kind of
couple new blushes from the brand number
seven like I just I don't need any new
blushes right now it definitely is the
palette that's for medium speed skin
tones obviously is not going to be for
me the ones for light/medium it looks
pretty it looks like there's perhaps
maybe more of like a bronzer shade in
there just from like the very small
picture I can see otherwise maybe it was
like how the flashes or what not maybe
it's supposed to be like a neutral blush
I'm not sure but it almost looks like
there's like a purplish type of blush in
there I think what seems to be like a
very hot pink like the shades don't
match what I wear for blush I'm a pretty
neutral light pink sometimes like a ma
be pink but very bright very deep purple
I do not wear those types of shades I
don't wear a lot of blush with shimmer
in it it looks like maybe there's a
couple of shimmer in it I can't quite
tell but it's just looking at the
swatches I know it's not going to be for
me so even if I really did need a blush
palette right now I don't think this is
going to be the one that's calling out
my name again I don't know the price
though sometimes it's hard to say but
even without the price I just know that
I don't need it so again these will be
available on May 10th
I know Joby splints is also coming out
with a new eyeshadow palette if you guys
want to see that in a future will I buy
it please let me know in the comments
down below but that's coming out a
little bit later in May so I thought I
would just touch on the blush palette
first so I'm going to be passing over
them I still have yet to try anything
from Julia's place I know I still really
want to try an eyeshadow palette I will
one of these times but I'm not going to
start with the blush palette let us know
are you getting this blush palette from
Julia's place did it catch your
attention right away to these blue
shades absolutely call your name let us
know in the comments down below what you
think of this one
so color top has some new releases I
feel like I haven't talked about color
pop in a while a bias video in a hot
minute and that was a conscious decision
because I felt like I was talking about
like every other video I'm like oh my
gosh I'll watch color Bob you guys know
that color palette comes out with new
products and new collections at like a
fastest rate ever and it's just crazy
but I did get a lot of tags about their
new metallic liquid lipsticks and I
thought okay I have
- mentioned colour-pop in a bit news
will i buy videos and so let's go ahead
and talk about these new lipsticks from
colour-pop they released three new
metallic liquid lipsticks in sandwiches
treat wave and dirty bird dirty birdie
dirty birdie so i'll insert some photos
in here we'll try to find some swatch
photos so you guys can see what they
look like their peers to be like us like
a raspberry pink like a peach a gold and
then a pinky lavender type of color but
counter pops how I'll have them listed
down below they are going to be six
dollars apiece which is totally not
about price color purposes were usually
pretty affordable with all of their
options which is fantastic I'm passing
over these because I do not really like
metallic lips I know a lot of people are
super into them and they can pull them
off hey I don't feel like I can really
pull them off I feel like mm I just look
a little bit strange so I got my
absolute favorite I don't find them to
be like super practical for me like I
don't really do very crazy out there
look how to makeup artist don't pretend
to be I have my comfort zone for sure
and metallic lips are not in my comfort
zone and that being said I have like
three or four metallic lips anyways I'm
just not a huge fan of any metallic lips
that I tried I don't think I've tried
any from colour-pop I don't need these
metallic lips and I just I don't really
want them anyways I don't think they
would get any sort of love from me
because the metallic lips that are
already owned like I know I have at
least one for share that I haven't even
opened or tried on my lips I just can't
keep hanging around because I'm like I
need metallic lips in my collection
though just in case like I just I won't
get rid of all of them it's a problem
and they get rid of some my lipstick
de-clutter bruh it doesn't make your
nose all of them but I know that I don't
need any more metallic lips but some of
the comments that below do you love a
metallic lips you find yourself wearing
them a lot what are some of your
favorite metallic lips I'd love to know
and are you going to get these from
colour-pop again only six dollars not a
bad price at all if that's on the
tongues down below which is out of this
colour-pop collection so the next items
that I'm going to be talking about I
most definitely have you guys to thank
because I
and know this was happening I but all of
a sudden on Instagram I kept getting
tagged on was pretty vulgar pretty
vulgar pretty vulgar I'm like what
entire name is pretty vulgar and why is
everybody taking me on this is such a
bizarre name since it is our tune and I
saw a pretty Walker is coming to Sephora
and I was like okay so a new brand again
first I couldn't tell if Sephora was
coming out with products and for some
reason they were called pretty vulgar I
was like what is going on so I figured
out that pretty vulgar as a brand and
it's coming into Sephora so my alright
I'm looking at a couple photos I see
trend mood you know talking about a bit
and I see what to me looks like a
collection there's an eyeshadow palette
and eyeliner in the lipstick oh my go
okay another pick a small collection
coming out and then they keep doing my
research and then I find that is not the
case I found a really nice article on
allure calm I'll link it down below and
it says that pretty vulgar is inspired
by vintage beauty products which has
mmediately got my attention because I'm
such a good vintage fan I think that I
should have been born in the 20s oh and
I thought one thing was interesting
there's a quote in there from a rep from
the bridge pretty vulgar it says the
idea is that sometimes you're in a
pretty mood and sometimes you feel Logan
OTT one thing all the time you know and
I would like that just like describes me
and it's so funny because I have so many
different interests and passions and
hobbies and a lot of times when I tell
people what I am they're like you just
don't go together like you just you want
to think if you're this thing that
you're that thing I'm a published out
there of five novels and a book blogger
I'm a huge book addict I'm reading all
the time if you followed me on snapchat
people my comments all the time like
your Kindle is on almost every single
snap and I'm like yes I know because I'm
reading all of the time I'm watching a
YouTube video but I'm reading a book and
people are like but you're a beauty
vlogger as well and you do the full
makeup everyday you toggle when it gets
like people don't think that those go
together and it's why I really struggled
finally getting into the beauty industry
and finally making a beauty channel
because I was always known as the author
in the book bloggers and people didn't
think that you can be both things I
thought that was really funny so when I
saw that quote and said were not one
thing all the time you know I was like
exactly sure that is me like I feel like
I immediately had the kinship oldest
brand I kept reading an article and in
the article mentions how the writer said
that they were surprised to find this
new company is launching into Sephora
stores because it can take brands years
to get into so far it's obviously super
well not on a ton of people purchase
from them but it says right out of the
gate pretty vulgar is rolling out 81 at
pieces on a Tuesday April 25th launch
which is a huge launch and so I went to
the Sephora website and holy buckets
like everything that you want is in
there
there's blushes regular lipsticks liquid
lipsticks mascaras bronzers I mean
there's nail polish I mean they have
like everything in there and I was like
my pennants okay so I thought that was
very interesting and you know they thank
you to you guys for letting me know
another brand was coming in to Sephora
because I really had no idea until you
guys are taking me about it I looked
into it and just immediately from that
little piece on a lure that I read it's
like I just like felt something for this
brand and so I'm on the support of
website again like I said they have a
ton of different things I'll just have
the link down below to the whole pretty
vulgar area so you can check out
everything the items that I'm most
interested in trying is that my lips are
sealed
liquid lipstick which is $24 simply
because I'm a lipstick addict
and I love liquid lipsticks I love
trying different ones out and I would
love to be able to see how these guys
stack up against other ones also heard
really good things about this other's
mascara already since I've done a little
bit of poking around is $24 I here is a
really nice mascara but the setting
spray is like getting me I really hope I
can get a good photo so I can insert it
in here
the locket makeup setting spray is $30
but the packaging looks like an old time
like perfume bottle with a little like
squeezy to my squeezing the perfume
comes out and I was like and I'm super
into studying for his right now makeup
mix everything I try to organize a
little bit as my office the other day
and I was doing it on snapchat and I
have just a row on my bookshelf of
setting sprays and it's a lot of them
and I showed you guys and it's like
super drawn to them right now now I just
thought that was
really pretty the packaging is so
freaking cute another thing I would love
to try is their undercover concealer is
$25 I really like concealers and again I
wear them every single day so I would
totally try them out are all launched on
the Sephora website right now so again
I'll have them linked down below at this
time I'm not going to purchase anything
right now
like when I get into them in this video
I'm not going to go and make a purchase
I just spent a lot of money at the VIP
sale so I really should be going on it
with no buy at this moment but I can't
just commit like that so I'm just
keeping in the back of my mind that I
should be on it know by but I need to
press pause on shopping for just a
little bit so I'm not going to purchase
right now and honestly I'm such a big
review person that I would kind of like
to see a couple review videos coming out
seeing what other people are saying
about the brain and the products that
they're trying I would really like to
know some of the thoughts and feedback
so far I haven't seen anything about
this a couple articles here and there
online and some of the writers have put
in their reviews but so far I haven't
seen any G Tube videos anybody knows if
anyone has reviewed anything for pretty
vulgar please leave that in the comments
down below because I would happily check
those out but those are some of the
items the liquid lipstick concealer the
seven sprays those are some of the
things that I have my eye on that maybe
I will purchase down the road especially
after I see a couple reviews but I'm
definitely super interested in very
intrigued by the brand I would also love
to know what you guys think about the
brand and like have you guys heard of
them yet or are you hearing by for the
first time are you super excited about
it did you already make a purchase from
them did you know about them before they
came in this for like I'm just super
curious I would love to know what you

people were very excited about it
because this is definitely the items
that I got asked the most about

different tags on so many different
Instagram accounts that were talking
