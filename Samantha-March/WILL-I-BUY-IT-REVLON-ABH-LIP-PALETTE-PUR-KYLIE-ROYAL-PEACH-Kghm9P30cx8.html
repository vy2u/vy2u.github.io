today's video is going to be a new will
i buy it i post my will i buy videos
every single Wednesday so I can always
check back here on my channel on
wednesdays for my next will i buy a
video in these videos i just discussed
products and I discuss if i'm going to
buy them or not to kind of give my
reasons and go over each of the products
usually like launch times that they
haven't launched yet for to give them
the price what's included etc i started
these videos as a way to still be able
to talk about new makeup releases
without having to buy everything because
i can't do that i don't get a lot of PR
packages yet so this was kind of my way
to be able to talk about usually like
new makeup releases or maybe like
relaunches or things like that still be
able to talk about them on my channel
without actually buying them so I'm
really excited that you guys have
continued to love on these videos and
that's why i brought it as a weekly
series now so I always have my will I by
Wednesday series so as always I'm gonna
have a lot of products to talk about so
why don't we go ahead and get started ok
so the first track day I want to talk
about is actually a drugstore product
and I have you guys to thank for talking
about this product because I noticed on
the last week's video there was multiple
comments asking me to talk about this
and then also a lot of thumbs ups on
those comments if you guys see if like
if you notice in the comments that
someone has commented a suggestion to
put in a future will i buy a video if
you give it a thumbs up they like you
thumbs up that comment it goes to the
top of that video so whenever I click on
the video that's like the comment that I
see at the top is the ones with the most
thumbs up so just a heads up if you did
not know that but a lot of people were
asking me to talk about the new revlon
colorstay cream eyeshadows and I was
like I've never even heard of these so I
had to look them up I'll insert a
picture here like I normally do in my
videos so from the Revlon website it
says this is luxurious blendable shadow
where's up to 24 hours looks like there
are 12 different shades and under the
description it says luxurious long-wear
cream eyeshadow with a pro inspired
built in brush designed for easy mess
free application where's up to 24 hours
and says there are four unique finishes
metallic matte pearl and satin its water
proof comes in
all shades okay so and it looks like
each one is about I'm seeing them for
you know sometimes drugstores can be a
little bit different on different sites
because I'm seeing them I'm 95 and then
also 799 across different sites though
it'll probably different be different
depending on what store you're looking
at but it'll be somewhere I would
probably say between like six and nine
dollars maybe for these so like I said
this is new to me new seeing them I
haven't seen them in my drug stores at
all but I haven't been to my drugstore
in a couple weeks yet and to be really
us I don't buy a lot from Revlon I was
trying to think if I have anything Rev
on in my collection and I actually don't
know if I do it's just not a brand that
I gravitate towards like at the
drugstore i typically go for Maybelline
alots Maybelline the most i go for
l'oreal i go for nicks and elf but i
don't really do a lot of revlon so i'm
like i don't know if they were even in
the drugstore I don't even know if I
really like look at the Revlon section
so I don't know there's that um they
look really cool though what they remind
me of is the Maybelline like colorstay
tattoos because they are also in like
the little platform it's interesting
that this one comes with its own brush
sometimes that's a little bit of a like
you don't really know what does the
brush going to be like is it going to be
good what not but i thought those
interesting that it comes with a brush
and it has the different finishes which
i think is interesting as well being
there's a couple cool shades in here
like I like the green of course I like
the browse and the neutrals there's kind
of like almost like a teal ish type of
shade that one looks really interesting
to let me know what you guys think would
you want to see these in a future video
would you want to see me doing like a
tutorial with them and talking about
them let me know what you think I know
the drugstore is coming out with a lot
of new products like it's getting crazy
but I've really been going off your
guys's suggestions and what you'd want
me to pick up from the drugstore and
things like that so let me know if you
guys are really curious about this I
feel like you are there's a lot of
questions to even put it in a will i buy
a video feel like you guys are probably
gonna be pretty curious about it but I
think they look interesting I'm curious
to try them especially because I'm just
curious to try the formula
because like the Maybelline ones are so
so different but I really do like the
Maybelline one that I have that's kind
of reminding me like this and this is
without seeing us watching it anything
I'm just going off like the packaging
like oh it looks similar I'm interested
in the different finishes so I don't
know I wouldn't be against find this
especially if there's like can you know
be some sort of deal at CVS or Alta you
know buy one get one half off or
anything like that I would not be
against getting this so this is on my
list now because i'm very curious since
a lot of you were asking about it but on
the comments down below would you want
to see a tutorial or review or swatch a
video of it let me know also let me know
if anybody's gotten them yet i saw that
they were a spring release but I mean
spring releases are here and out now for
other lines so I'll have to go to my CBS
and see if I can find them as always
thank you for those suggestions I hope
that you keep the suggestions coming
because that really just help me out
with what to film so of course leave any
suggestions down below for future will
if I have videos well I've been getting
a lot of questions about this one as
well I waited for as long as I could to
talk about it now we have some more
information on it but a lot of people
have been asking me about the nuance
pavia Beverly Hills lip palette so
looking at the trend mood one Instagram
it's called the AVH lip palette pro lip
palette design it says there's 18 Matt
ultra pigment rich colors the palette
comes with the dual ended brush /
spatula and mixing plate for customizing
love colors that's actually pretty cool
says it is permanent hollow for
permanent items it's $48 it'll be
available on the Anasazi a website
January tenth online at sephora also
Macy's and dillards around march first
and in stores March fifteenth ok so
again I'll insert the pitcher down here
I've seen a couple of swatches of them I
do kind of know right away though that
i'm not going to purchase a lip palette
I think lip pallets are really good if
you are like a freelance makeup artist
and you would need it for your kit I
think lip pallets are good for that but
as someone for me who just sits at home
and does her makeup and then plays on
youtube I don't really need a lipstick
palette I think the colors are good a
lot of people were saying that they were
Press that there's like whites and
blacks in there as well so you can kind
of even you know kind of change up the
colors mixed colors around it's really
cool that it comes with a little mixing
palette I've been actually mixing
lipsticks a little bit more especially
on Instagram and I'm just using like a
top of like a glass container that we
have to mix them so I think like the
little mixing palette is pretty cool and
then of course it comes with a brush I
would kind of hope so with the lip
palette $48 i actually I don't think
forty dollars is a bad price for what it
is you're getting for 18 shades a double
in the brush and the palette like I
don't think that's a bad price but again
it's just not something that I need in
my collection if you're a huge like
anastacio collector and you need
everything from anastacio like yeah
totally get this and I feel like you
would be able to put it to use but like
you know when I've talked about lip
palace in the past I think it was an
urban decay one that I talked about I'm
not going to put an entire lip palette
in my purse like if I wear one of the
shades out one of my supposed ml
supposed to take my whole lip palette
and my little clutch because that's not
gonna fit so you know it's just it's not
a practical by for me which is why I'm
going to pass over it I'd like to think
of myself as a practical shopper not
always but most of the time I feel like
I'm pretty practical and let palettes I
know are just an immediate like no go
wouldn't fitted for me but again I think
it's a good price I think it's pretty
cool if you're freelance artist I think
that would be awesome or you just really
love anastasiya probably be pretty good
but of course let me know in the
comments down below are you going to
pick up the slit palette so I've been
getting asked a lot about new releases
from a pure cosmetics and this is very
recent from the time that i'm filming
looks like peer as taking an influencer
trip with a couple of big beauty
influencers they are where they like
Saint Martin or something like that
looks really cool wish I was there once
again my invite got lost like I need to
check my address make sure why those
invites are not getting to me so strange
but a couple of the new things I want to
talk about this isn't everything I don't
think that is new coming out but a few
things that I want to touch on so first
are coming out with their no filter
blurring photography primer of the time
not in filming it is available on the
pier website I didn't see it yet on Alta
if it is available by the time this
video goes up I'll have that link down
below as well this is thirty-three
dollars four point five fluid ounces it
says moisturize color balance Prime and
illuminate the skin in one step this is
unique primer was prismatic blurring
micro pearls helps to color correct
while age-defying skincare ingredients
that nourishes the skin and vitamin
Ridge energy complex with moisturizing
agave and essential fatty acids prep the
skin for makeup application load it with
essential oils like coconut olive and
Shia a drop of this into your foundation
will result in a duel yet shine-free
finished at boost radiance and masks and
perfections for a picture perfect
complexion you know what it kind of
reminds me of no filter blur and
photography it kind of reminds me of the
Becca backlight priming filter because
it also sounds like it has a little bit
of illumination just like the Becca one
for that reason I probably won't
purchase it because I feel like it might
be kind of close to the back of one's
like this might be something that I have
to go in in store and like actually try
it on my hand or something like that but
i'm not a huge primer fan a lot of times
i just like spray my face with some sort
of primer I know that primer is great
and good but honestly to me I really
feel like I only need it when I'm like
going out and about and I'm going to be
gone for a long time I mean that's just
my opinion as of right now with how I'm
doing my makeup primer isn't something
that's like super super essential to me
so for thirty-three dollars and feeling
like I have something pretty similar in
my collection I think I will pass over
this one so that also are coming out
with the bare it all for one skin
perfecting foundation so this is a 12
hour wear foundation it is thirty-nine
dollars for 1.5 ounces of product let's
see it says this high-performance
12-hour demi matte foundation helps
cover imperfections and instantly
perfect the skin while helping to
correct problem areas over time so you
can confidently bare it all designed for
face and body and formulated with peers
priority energy complex and keratin
complex this formula reduced the look of
your skin and goes the distance it will
not fade quite or crumble under any
condition you may face throughout day
hmm okay so $39 that's not
awful right now that's not too bad my
clinic foundation is 27 but I know some
higher-end foundations can get in the
40s and 50s and even a little bit higher
so $39 not too bad hmm this one I might
have to think about I might have to
think about this one I like that it says
debbie mat because i don't like super
super matte foundations a lot of times
because i feel like they can just be a
little like to on my skin sometimes so
that's interesting $39 to me is just a
little bit more pricey ok and wanting to
get a new foundation I'm running low on
a couple of my foundations so I've been
wanting to pick up a new one but a
couple ones from the drugstore that are
coming out just are not interesting me
and I'm not hearing good things about
them so maybe the pier one might be
something that I could try I really do
like pure cosmetics I really do i'm
wearing a lot of pure cosmetics on my
face right now my eyes are pure
cosmetics my lip is pure cosmetics my
highlight newspaper cosmetics i really
do like Pierre and I have a lot from
them for that reason I really might
might go for this one you guys what do
you think about it I might wait and see
a little bit more swatches I might wait
till maybe it's in stores at aalto so I
can go in and try to make sure I find my
shade maybe I don't know i think i might
get this one obviously this is the first
time that I'm really like looking like
deep into it which is why I'm like so
like what should i do but I'm pretty
interested so for the reason that I'm
wanting to get a new foundation and I do
need a new foundation i'm about to run
out of at least three foundations
they're getting down there like when i
try to hit the pump that's like no no no
you're gonna have to shake me a little
bit or something so i know i'm getting
down there in a couple of them like i
said i like pure cosmetics I really do
they're definitely a brain that I
support so might try this one I think
I'm going to try this one and also a
reason why I'm interested in trying this
one is because they also just released
new brushes and I am super super
interested in these brushes I'm not
going to lie so they came out with some
skin perfecting brushes and I'm seeing a
foundation brush which is twenty-eight
dollars but I'm pretty sure they also
were coming out like ice a lot like
smaller concealer brushes type of thing
but the one that I think that I would
really be the most interested in is the
foundation brush it does say it's for
face and body it looks really big I
don't maybe it would be too big for my
face it might be too big for my face the
foundation one is twenty-eight dollars
it says a soft synthetic fiber brush
with a larger panel that gives skin as
smooth airbrush effect that looks like a
second skin can be used to apply creams
powders and bronzer on the face and body
I'm not gonna lie i'm very interested in
this you know a lot of people really
like the oval brushes and and that sort
of thing so that's why i like this one
was kind of catching my attention I
can't find the other brushes I could
have swore on their trip I was seeing
smaller brushes as well but i can't find
that right now on the website so i'm not
sure all i see right now is the
foundation 14 28 you know people really
like the our teeth brushes the oval
brushes we like a lot of the dupes i
have some dupes from my makeup brush set
and I actually really do like them i use
them pretty frequently in my instagram
tutorials so i'm really considering this
one so i'm thinking about maybe getting
the pure foundation and then the
foundation brush and using them together
and I don't maybe I could do like a
first impression or I could review it
like try it out for a while and review
it what do you guys think I really
really love the pier four and one
mineral pressed powder it was in my
ride-or-die videos in my best beauty
2016 video I really like that so I think
that's the only like real pure face
product that i've tried otherwise i just
have like eyes and lips I mean I have
highlight but like I don't have any
other type of foundations I just have
that powder so i'm really i'm thinking
about this one you guys I'm thinking
about this one and i'm pretty sure that
I do want to get the foundation and the
brush together I just think it would be
fun to try out what are you guys like
are you going to get it are you getting
it I think I'm going to get those two
and see what I think I'll probably pass
over that primer but the foundation and
the brochure really got me interested so
I was also getting some questions about
the trolls eyeshadow palette from pier
and asking if I was going to get that
actually you guys Pierre sent it to me
in a Pew our package like whoa whoa I
was so excited because it was actually a
really cool package it came with like a
chocolate sucker and like a snap
bracelet and some peasant there was like
a troll on it like
it was like an actual PR package like I
shared it on my snapchat people are
stopping me back and sing like medicine
builder has that on her snapchat right
now to like you got the same packages
her I was like this is so crazy like
I've gotten a few things here and there
from pier but I don't like consistently
get anything from them and I remember
opening this up like I remember getting
the package and it didn't say pure on it
wasn't till I opened it up that I saw
the pier name and I was like are you
kidding me right now so I was so I was
so grateful I just thought this was
really cool I didn't even know that they
were coming out with this palette it is
in a collaboration with DreamWorks and
Cole's of the trolls movie that is
coming out but doesn't that just look so
cool I think it looks really really
beautiful it send me a little card about
it too it's a 16-piece eyeshadow palette
its twenty nine dollars and let's see
it'll be available on pure cosmetics on
January a so it should already be out
there and exclusive and closed stores
nationwide on January nineteenth so
again I just thought it was really cool
off so grateful to appear for sending
this to me do you guys I wanted to
mention it because people did ask me if
I'd be buying it so i wanted to mention
that i did receive it and i wanted to
ask you guys do you want to see a
tutorial video or just a swatch video
let me know what you think i haven't
gotten into it yet in case you guys
wanted to see a tutorial and first
review type of thing so let me know in
the comments down below because I've
been waiting to jump into this so I
could talk about it first but let me
know if you'd want to see any type of
videos with this palette otherwise I'll
just do a couple things for Instagram
with it but big thank you to Pierre I
just just thank you okay and then lastly
of course I have been getting a ton of
questions on this new release that's
coming up it is from Kylie cosmetics and
of course everyone is wondering if i
will be purchasing the royal peach
palette so i'll insert some photos down
here so the royal peach palette has 12
shades it's a mixture of matt and
shimmers it does come with a mirror and
also a brush $45 it goes on sale January
12 at 3pm PST so this is the first Kylie
palette I believe that comes with a
mirror and a brush have I don't think
the other ones have come with me r
and I know that they haven't come with
brushes so this is the four so that's
good i think she was getting a lot of
feedback that people do like mirrors and
I know people tend to like brushes
sometimes I'd like a love hate sometimes
with the brushes that comes with palette
sometimes they're great sometimes it's
like oh that was pointless would rather
you've knocked a couple dollars off and
left the brush out I was also watching
Jacqueline Hills snapchat last night and
she's been the only one that I've seen
so far and I've tried to actually talk
about like the physical pout like a lot
of people are doing the spa tchas and
talking about the shadows which is great
obviously that's super important but she
was the first one that was like this is
the most durable Kylie palette you know
it's like the heaviest type of pellet so
that was interesting to know because no
one else had really been talking about
that so against $45 12 shades mirror and
a brush you guys I actually think I want
to get this one which surprises me a
little bit I don't have any of the Kylie
eyeshadow palette so far I believe she
had her first eyeshadow palette she had
the burgundy palette and she had a
couple ones around the holiday time
there isn't it doesn't say if this is
permanent or if it's a limited edition
or if it would like come back type of
thing I couldn't find anything like that
but i think i really like it like the
shades in there are so intriguing to me
like that green like I just I some of
those shimmer shades the blue I'm really
curious about I feel like everyone's
eyes kind of goes towards the blue
there's a really pretty looks to be kind
of like a gold from what I can tell in
the swatches that just looks super
pretty and then of course the peachy
colors in there as well I do like peach
makeup if you guys can't tell i just did
a tutorial with the peach palette i
bought the PG lip bundle from colour-pop
like I do like peach and I think it's
complimentary to my skin tone and so
even though this palette isn't full of
peach colors like I said there's those
few other colors in there as well I'm
very very intrigued about it now Kylie's
launches can drive me crazy because
sometimes most of the time you have to
be like on your computer on the website
ready to go a lot of times you get
pointing out line things are being taken
I recurrent like it's pure craziness and
I'm
like man that's really annoying like
it's it's super annoying you guys but
I'm trying to think 3 p.m. PST I think
maybe that's five o'clock of my time I
can never remember if it's two hours
ahead or behind CST but I think of its
maybe five o'clock on thursday i think
i'd probably be home like if I was like
out and about i don't think i would get
on my phone and purchase it because I
just like don't want to buy into the
hype that way you know what I mean like
I don't want to like drop everything
just to buy makeup like if I'm at home
by myself i'm chillin not that by myself
means anything but you know I'm just
here I'm around I'm ready for it like
sure I'll buy it but if I'm like out I'm
not gonna be like um friends stop
talking to me i need to go buy some
makeup i just think that would be really
annoying and my my book I don't off
maybe some of you guys are like that but
i think if i can get it i will purchase
it and i'm excited i've heard you know
pretty mixed things about Kylie's I
shadow palettes like eye shadow palette
I don't think has like the best reviews
the burgundy palette sounds like a lot
of people really did like again heard
kind of mixed reviews about the holiday
ones but so far what I'm seeing from the
swatches you know a couple of the
influencers a couple a couple of the
influencers got got these pallets a
handful of these influencers it got
these packages are these pallets and so
I've been looking at their swatches and
it just seems like colors that I really
like and I would like to be able to try
out Kiley's I shadow palettes I like
this one the most probably because of
the mirror especially I really do like
palettes that have mirrors and it just
makes it so much easier especially
because I don't have a mirror like in my
office I am working off like a little
handheld mirror or else the mirrors and
palate so it really does help me out
when the mares are in the pallets so
four to five dollars i don't think is an
insane price for Kylie cosmetics I hope
maybe there's free shipping again every
once in a while she now offers free
shipping which I really really
appreciate because in the beginning it
was like nine to ten dollars for
shipping even if you're only buying a
lipstick it's crazy so maybe there'll be
something with shipping but as of right
now I'm leaning towards yes if i can get
it i know the launches are crazy and
things sell out really fast and i have a
feeling this one will definitely be a
very very fast to sell
but if i can get it i'm going to try so
maybe we'll see it maybe we won't if you
guys don't follow me on snapchat just
mail it out march so I show you know the
new products and things that I'm getting
on their first typically before I can
get you on youtube or even Instagram so
you can follow me over there cuz I'd
probably be the first place to see if I
am able to get the pellet or I'd even
just tell you guys if I got the pellet
but I'm going to go for this one and see
if I can get it if not you know it's not
gonna be the end of the world like I
will survive and I will be able to move
on but I'm gonna give it a try so let me
know what you think in the comments down
below will you'll be trying to get this
one will you put your friends on hold to
purchase it when it comes out or what
you'd be like me and just try to
purchase it if you're around and can get
it let me know down below if there's
gonna be everything for this week so
will i buy a video I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video of course
