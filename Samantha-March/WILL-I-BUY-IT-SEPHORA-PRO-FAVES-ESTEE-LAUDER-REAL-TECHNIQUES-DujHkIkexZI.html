today's video is going to be a new will
I bias I 1200 a bias videos every single
Wednesday I'm talking about some new
makeup releases and launches letting you
know a little bit about them and then
letting you know if I'm planning on
purchasing them or passing over them and
then getting a your feedback on if you
think I should purchase them or if you
will be purchasing them which is one of
my favorite parts of this series like I
said I do post these videos every single
Wednesday so I will have my playlist
linked down below in case you were
interested in catching up on any of my
past will i buy videos in addition to my
wheeler my videos I post a lot of
content I for sure post on Wednesdays
Thursdays Sundays and Mondays and then I
livestream on Tuesdays at 4 o'clock CST
for the afternoon
CST and I have been giving up weekend
videos on Friday and Saturday so right
now the last couple weeks have been
posting a video every single day which
has been a lot of work that's been a lot
of fun and there's so much going on in
the makeup world right now that it's
actually easy for me to come up with
content to post every single day but if
you like a lot of content about makeup
and beauty I hope that you will consider
subscribing because you will get a video
from me almost on a daily basis but as
always with my bull I bite videos I do
have a lot to talk about so why don't I
go ahead and get started quite a few
tags on some new brushes that are coming
out from Real Techniques
and I think maybe I got tagged a lot
because so many people know how much I
love brushes like I have an addiction to
buying makeup brushes a sad sad sickness
that I have so Real Techniques is coming
out with a new brush collection in
powder blue it includes a plush powder
puff for $10 a soft powder brush for 21
a soft finish finishing brush for 21 a
soft complexion brush for 21 a soft
shadow brush for 13 and a soft kabuki
for 25 so it sounds like you can just
buy them all separately or see anything
about buying them as a set so I'm not
sure if that is a possibility I am
reading from the trend would one
Instagram like I do in most of my will I
buy at videos so her Instagram page is
always linked in my description box as
well so definitely the photos that I
have seen come off of this collection
that look really cool like the photos
have like a blue hue to them as well the
brushes look very beautiful and they
almost look like luxurious
and I don't know for real techniques you
know real techniques for some of the
first brushes that I bought and I can
remember bind them at Ulta and I knew
that like their regular brushes were
pretty affordable and then I remember I
wanted to buy I don't know what the
collection was called but I think you
had like gold handles and I was like so
excited about them and they were super
pricey and I could never do it like for
someone who loves makeup brushes I just
couldn't do it because they were so
expensive I even can recall one time at
Kohl's
they were having like a sale and I was
so excited about it and then I get up
there with the brushes and they're like
oh no it's not applicable on like the
makeup items and I'm like what so I
decide them that's true story so when I
see these prices the twenty one dollars
and twenty five dollars I'm like that's
pretty expensive like we're getting into
some higher-end prices over here so I
don't know that's really interesting to
me and I don't know sometimes I'm
feeling the vibes from a lot of
companies that are affordable but their
prices are slowly inching up I mean even
the drugstores on the drug store the
other day and I almost bought a
Neutrogena foundation and it was $17 for
$18 and I was like no my out of
stylistic foundation is 25 like what are
you talking about drugstore and you're
not gonna let me swatch it to find my
shades like no so I don't know that was
crazy to me but that's a whole other
Rams eye doesn't have really anything to
do with this I'm gonna buy this or not
it just when I saw Real Techniques and I
saw the prices I was like um okay so
that's what we're doing but I know that
I'm going to pass over the powder blue
collection from Real Techniques honestly
the price kind of has you feelin a
little on the weird side but I just
don't need any makeup brushes if you
guys are following my blog series I've
had three blogs so far and it's all
about organizing my office and I need to
do something with this poor little room
that I live in every single day because
my makeup collection is getting a bigger
and bigger and crazier and crazier and
trying to organize everything and my
brush collection is so so big I don't
need any and especially for these high
prices for Real Techniques even though
the brushes look very cool and I'm into
like these photo
they look very luxurious at night and
they better be for their prices but I
just don't meet them personally myself
so I'm going to go ahead and pass over
the Real Techniques blue collection of
brushes but let us know in the comment
below are you super excited for these
brushes do you love Real Techniques I do
like real sightings and I have a love of
their brushes but I say no but let us
know in the comments your thoughts as
well anything asked quite a few
questions on what I think of the new sa
Lauder Double Wear dude water fresh
foundation so si Lauder is a very well
known for their double wear foundation
when I started my channel I remember
hearing so many people talking about the
SA Lauder Double Wear but one thing that
I always heard was that it was super
super full coverage and even back when I
was first getting into makeup I knew
that I was not into full coverage like
when I first really started wearing
makeup I was wearing a lot of like BB
creams you know maybe a BB cream with a
powder foundation on top like I wasn't
doing like full foundations and
specialist full coverage foundations and
so I knew that it wasn't for me and then
as I grew more into makeup and doing my
makeup more and experimenting with
different foundations I have definitely
found like my sweet spot with
foundations which is a medium to full
coverage more on medium though full
coverage foundations I just don't like
them on me I don't like how they finish
on me I just don't like how they look or
how they feel so I've never really been
interested in Estee Lauder Double Wear
because that's all I think of when I
hear of that foundation is how full
coverage it is so that being said they
now have this new foundation to double
wear nude water fresh so you hear water
so I immediately think this is going to
be more lightweight this isn't going to
be a full coverage foundation so from
what I'm reading it says it has a
lightweight formula it also has SPF 30
is oil free and oil controlling and
hydrating and 24-hour wear is a light to
medium covers with a real skin satin
finish vicita it is a $42 and you get
the standard one ounce of $42 that seems
kind of where I would have thought that
the foundation would have landed that
seems pretty standard for a brand such
as Estee Lauder you get the one ounce
which is pretty standard with
foundations as well so I don't have any
problems with the price and I think
jpgs on this too because i keep saying
that i all of a sudden an obsessed with
buying a foundation like i just want to
try all the different foundations i'm
just having like the best time testing
out foundations so with that in mind i'm
very much considering getting this one
i'm i'm trying to way back and forth
because i'm like I have so many
foundations and I'm testing out so many
new foundations like do I really need
another one especially a $42 foundation
but I think I'm really interested
because I always hear really good things
about the Estee Lauder foundations
especially the double where it just for
me doesn't fit with like my makeup vibes
and what I prefer so now that we have
this other one that's more of the light
to medium coverage that I would probably
find myself liking a lot more I'm
interested in trying it just so I can be
able to provide my feedback on it and
you to know that I say a lot of
foundation and what I think of it to be
able to review it and all that good
stuff
and then also of course because I am now
a foundation junkie and I want to try
all the foundations so I'm also planning
on some foundation videos coming out
like the best and worst wrecks or
foundations the best amorous high-end
foundations so that's another reason why
I'm kind of like justifying my
foundation purchases because of my
clothes for research purposes so that's
why but I really am considering it
getting this one at a time time filming
I didn't see it on the Sephora website
yet I did see it on the Estee Lauder
website and the only thing that I saw on
the trend would Instagram it said will
be available in July so I'm assuming
sometime in July that we will get it
online or in short that other retailers
as well such as Sephora so I have a
little bit of time to think about it but
I'm definitely leaning towards yes but I
want to try out this new si Lauder
foundation it just grabbed my attention
right away but let us know in the
comments down below if you have the
original sa letters double where'd you
love it are you curious to try out this
new foundation I would love to know okay
I remember and talked about are actually
both from Sephora like Sephora brand
which i think is a lot of fun I was
getting so many tags on this one because
you I'm sorry you guys was like no way
so well it's so awesome
but Sephora is coming out with a new
favorite set if they're bronzed and
ready to go
so let's see it's $36 and includes the
benefit
- hi be my liquid face highlighter the
coverfx illuminating primer the Mars
Beauty Highliner gel eye crayon in
Rococo the Sephora collection colorful
gloss balm and then a full-sized Stila
Cosmetics magnificent metal glitter and
glow eyeshadow and kitten karma I didn't
know that was full size and the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil matte bronzer in
medium so $36 for all of that so it
sounds like everything else is probably
a deluxe sized sample the Sephora
collection gloss is also full size we've
done a lot of both sides what's going on
here the Marc Jacobs eyeliner is
full-sized this water collection gloss
is full-sized and the Stila cosmetics is
full side that's amazing for $36 okay
okay okay that's pretty amazing so I
honestly when I saw it I was like I just
all I did was a look at the photo and I
mean you can tell off the photo in here
you can see what's in there from the
photo and I was like oh no I probably
don't need it I have the Too Faced
bronzer high-beam I don't have myself
but I don't need another highlighter
right now like I'm totally fine without
having a highlighter like the Sephora
lip balm but doesn't do a whole lot for
me but to have the Stila metal and the
Marc Jacobs Highliner the Stila glitters
or what $24 and the Marc Jacobs eyeliner
is 20 maybe around the $20 price range I
think and you get this whole set for $36
I think I just changed my mind and
what's the cover FX the cover FX is an
illuminating primer heck I would try
that are getting here Airy snoring I
don't she just I don't know what to do
with her you guys she's snoring and
every video is so ridiculous but that is
seriously does an amazing value I think
I love the sephora favorites collections
I think they're such a good value I'm
such a sucker for them and I was going
to buy the last one that came out I
talked about the inner will eyes by a
while back and I said that I was going
to buy it it was all about like summer
glow and bronze and that sort of thing
and then it was like the very next day
or something I got my wisdom tooth
removed and it was like a really bad
procedure and I
went down so hard and I couldn't make
myself buy it because like I am where
make up for like a very long time I just
it was a really bad procedure okay we
just let's let's move on from it because
it dredges up lots of memories so I
didn't get it I was pretty bummed out
about it but now this one I mean just
again I love the marching cup eyeliners
and I don't have the rokoko and I've
been wanting to try out a steel of
glitter for a long time so things I feel
like you make it very worth it I checked
real quick the more she kept eyeliner is
$25 and the Stila glitter is 24 for the
full sizes i new get this whole set for
$36 I think I'm gonna have to go for it
man like the next time I place the
Sephora order I think I'm gonna have to
go ahead and get this one but you guys
can get this set are you interested in
it I service out yet it says I'm the
trend would website available now in
stores so I'm not sure if it's going to
come online I checked right before I sat
down to film and it wasn't online yet so
I would assume it would come online but
maybe they have some questions that want
to go in stores but I'll leave it linked
down below if it's online by the terms
video goes up but I think that's too
good of a deal to pass up so I think I
might have to get this one so it's
pretty exciting to me it let us know in
the comments down below if you're
excited for this one if you love the
support favorites collections as well
and what you would be most excited to
get out of this collection that's a good
deal I have been giving so many tags on
this one
like so many tags so from the Sephora
collection it's a part of their fall
2017 collection they're coming out with
new Sephora Pro eyeshadow palettes and
warm cool and editorial so I'll have a
photo a link down below
says it'll be available around July 14th
three different eyeshadow palettes I
think 28 sheets each I believe and $65 H
so one is obviously the warm tones one
we have cool tones and one is editorial
it looks like they have some writer
colors in that one definitely for me the
warm one caught my eye initially I've
been seeing sneak peeks at this palette
come out for a while and a lot of people
were comparing the warmth on one to
detach into known a sunset palette which
I can definitely see I do see a lot of
similarities in it but
I honestly was a little surprised when I
saw the $65 price tag that's quite a bit
for a Sephora collection I know that
they say Sephora pro so I guess it's
supposed to be probably better but I
don't know that's still kind of a lot of
money to me it kind of makes me wonder -
do I get the Sephora or do I still get
the de Tasha de nonne a sunset at 129
like obviously sixty-five is less than
129 because I know that but would they
come anywhere close to the quality of
the Natasha Genoa and you know how
fantastic I hear her eye shadows are so
this is very interesting to me
I am super curious to get your guys
thoughts on this because I literally am
seeing the price for the first time as
I'm sitting down to film this trend Luke
just posted this 26 minutes ago that's
interesting
I honestly what I think I'm saving up
for a beauty lish order I want to do a
beauty list order try few new brands
that I haven't tried before
Natasha janata being one of them and
then be able to do a big haul here on my
channel so I've been saving up for it
because of course we're going to be as
sensitive so there's that but I
definitely had been eyeing the Natasha
Jeannot sunset palette so yeah I don't
know do you do it do you do the 65 and
try the Sephora I'm kind of torn you
guys this is this is tough for me my
initial thought is that I would rather
get a Natasha de Nonna
but I don't know if that's just dumb is
it just dumb let me know in the comments
down below I would love to know your
guys opinions because I'm really stuck
on this one I even though I mean I
definitely feel like I don't need an
eyeshadow palette right now I'm on like
eyeshadow palette overload but you know
what makeup junkie I'm a mega bad egg
which is what it is so I'm definitely
interested I just I don't feel like I
should get both I feel like that sounds
like a bad idea especially at 65 and 129
like that's insane you just need one of
them but what do I do I'm completely
stuck on this one I don't have a solid
answer am I going to buy it no idea I'm
stuck I truly want to hear your guys's
comments you know that I read and
respond to a lot of your comments you
guys have talked me into makeup
as attachment out of makeup and I
appreciate your comments so much so I
would love to know what you think about
these Sephora Pro pallets that are
coming out are you planning on getting
them do you think $65 is a good deal do
you think it's too pricey for a Sephora
palette let me know in the comments down
below what you think what you think
about the palettes and if you think that
you would pick them up let me know and
hopefully we can help crack this makeup
