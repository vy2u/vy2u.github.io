today's video is going to be a new will
i buy a video one mifare video to film
if you are new to my channel welcome
thank you for coming by my name is
Samantha I post videos about four or
five times a week and I'm excited for
this will i buy a video because it's
actually going to kick off my will i buy
it series so every wednesday i'm going
to be posting a will i buy it so it'll
be a Willa by a Wednesday type of video
so for my will I fight videos basically
what i do is i take some makeup products
typically new releases and I just
discuss will i buy and why i want to buy
it or why i think i'm going to pass on
the product so i got the idea a couple
months back because i was just getting a
little frustrated because i felt like i
wasn't being able to talk about new
makeup releases on my channel because
i'm gonna get PR packages you know I
can't just go out and buy every single
in the release and I was like me and you
know I wish I could be talking about
these things and I just thought that
would be a really fun video idea so
that's kind of where the will i buy it
came from so I'm still being able to
talk about new makeup releases without
having to buy all of the new makeup
releases because I just can't do it so I
like I said this is going to be the
first in my will i buy it wednesday
series so every wednesday you can come
to my channel i will have a new will i
buy it video and i'm really really
excited for this these have become some
of my most popular videos on my channel
and they are requested so much i'm
constantly getting new suggestions for
makeup products to put in my will i buy
videos so i figured let's just turn it
into a weekly series so please do every
time I post a will i buy video leave in
the comments below products that you'd
want to see in my next will i buy it
because i was doing these like maybe
every other week every three weeks or so
I was doing will i buy it but now I'm
going to do it every single week so make
sure you are leaving me your suggestions
but when I'm I go ahead and happen to it
so what I want to talk about first is
some new releases from Smashbox so
Smashbox is coming out with new eyes
shadow palettes they are called the
cover shot eyeshadow palettes and their
age twenty-nine dollars so there are
seven
r choa pellets that they're releasing so
these are kind of smaller pellets I'll
go ahead and insert as many as i can in
here just show some of the pallets
throughout as I'm talking about them but
there's seven different palettes still
they have a blaze which is like a desert
inspired palette they have bold which
has a lot of like fun bright colors they
have golden hour which looks like golden
type of shades they have matte which is
a non matte palette metallic which is
all like foil finish type of shadows
smokey which would be perfect for the
smoky eye and soft light which looks
like a lot of like soft neutral rose
gold type of shadows the matte shadow is
all mad I think there are a few off
shimmer shadows and some have a mixture
of matte and shimmer if I'm reading this
correctly so it says this is a
collection of seven travel-size palettes
inspired by trends seen at the studio
from Matt to metallic too bold this is
also in collaboration with social
superstar Shay Mitchell okay and each
pallet is running for twenty nine
dollars they are available on sephora
they will be available on the smashbox
website starting December second as i am
filming this video they are already
completely sold out at sephora because
what's new that's that's all makeup does
these days as they come out and they're
sold out in one day I don't know when
they were coming back to sephora but it
does say that they are coming back
because there's a link in there that
says email me with these are back in
stock so they will be coming back to
sephora i don't know when but they will
be available on the smashbox website
starting in december second so to be
honest I was out when these came out I
was actually a little confused because I
really hadn't seen anything about them
yet usually when new releases are coming
they're kind of like leaked I don't know
if that's really the right word but
teased maybe and you know we kind of
know something is coming and I think it
was just the day before that these
released on Sephora that I saw something
on smash boxes instagram about it and I
was like wait what who what are these
and so that was a little surprising and
a lot of times you'll even CPR packages
coming out so I was kind of frustrated
because when these did release
on sephora i didn't know which one to
get because i didn't see swatches I
didn't see real life pictures or snaps
of these pallets and that was a little
confusing and also at the time that they
released I think it was right when they
released on sephora they finally
announced who it was in collaboration
with kept saying like oh wait to see who
we collab with and I was like why is it
a secret who did you collab with and so
the collaborator is shaved Mitchell and
I'm going to be honest I don't really
know who that is I guess she's an
actress from Pretty Little Liars I don't
watch TV so a lot of times when it comes
to like actors and actresses I don't
know who these people are I don't really
watch movies I don't watch a lot of TV
so I'm like I don't know who that is but
again it's something that was this one
when I saw these pallets I was like I
know I want to get one of them I don't
know which one and then they announced
the collaboration and I was like okay I
don't get why it was like a secret and
to me who the collaborator is doesn't
make me want to buy the palace I just
wanted them in general and so if you
can't tell as I'm saying this I did want
to buy a pallet no they look cute they
look pretty $29 is not a bad price but I
really really like Smashbox cosmetics
I've invited more and more from them and
I've just been really happy with
everything that I've been purchasing
from them so I was excited for these it
was a little overwhelming but there was
seven of them because I was like how do
you pick which one to choose I knew
right away that I didn't want the like
the bold ones I don't really wear those
type of colors and I kind of threw out
the mat one as well because I have a
handful of all matte eyeshadow palettes
so then I still had five pallets to
choose from so that was pretty wild just
these look like palettes that I wanted
to have and I wish I could have been
able to buy more of them I just stuck
with getting one palette and you will
see it soon in an upcoming video but i
wish i could have gotten more but I kind
of just wanted to get one and see how
the quality is I'm really disappointed
that they're sold out at sephora already
i have a feeling they'll probably sell
out on Smashbox pretty quickly as well
but it's a little disappointing because
I was hoping if I really liked one I
would maybe get another one but that's
probably not going to be able to be the
case because by the time
I get it and see it and review it are
they even going to be in stock I don't I
don't know so it's a little frustrating
how fast makeup is selling out and how
these kind of new makeup releases are
going does anyone agree with me there I
don't know that's just my thought today
will i buy it I mean like spoiler alert
I already bought one so I have will have
a video coming up very soon on it so
you'll see my thoughts and my reviews I
really hope that the pilot comes back to
sephora very quickly and I hope they
don't sell out on Smashbox too quickly
as well but um I will leave any links
that i can find in the description box
below but like i said they'll be
available on the smashbox website on dis
number second i just thought the concept
was really cool each pallet looked
really unique like i said i wish i could
have gotten like all five of the other
pilots that I want it besides like the
two that I knew it for sure i didn't
want like i wish i could have bought all
five that would have been a lot of fun
but i thought the concept was neat and I
liked that these are like smaller palace
there a little bit less expensive and I
kind of liked each shade and like how
they were grouped I just thought it was
a lot of fun the collaboration didn't
really do anything for me I didn't
really care about that but i love the
smashbox as a brand so will i buy it yes
did i buy it yes so the next one I want
to talk about is from Tarte cosmetics
and it's the pro glow highlight and
contour palette so this one is of $45
and it looks like a nice palette it has
six different shades inside of like
contour and highlight shades also a
cream contour and then a powder contour
shade in there and then I believe the
other four are all highlights like I
said it's $45 so i really like tart i
buy a lot from Tarte cosmetics and I've
been really happy with a lot that I've
purchased from them I saw this palette
come out when there was the the Bora
Bora trip where I'm tart took a group of
influence i was down to Bora Bora and
they announced some new palettes down
there but immediately this one just did
not catch my eye guess I'm just not a
huge fan of like the kits so much
anymore that come with multiple shades
because even with like my Anastasio glow
kiss there's always like that shade or
two that you're not using and i don't
know like looking this over like I think
there are net
a lot of like very pretty shades in
there that I'd probably use but I don't
know if I'd use them on so I'm kind of
wanting to get back more on like just
buying the single highlighters like the
champagne pop or the Becca opal or even
like mary-lou manizer from the bomb and
knowing that I'm going to like use the
crap out of that highlight instead of
buying these kids and then having those
one to two shades that I just completely
ignore I don't know that's just kind of
like what I'm finding myself personally
with like the highlight kits that I use
and also the contour that can like
really be a hit or miss for me I'm
pretty particular about my contour
shades because if you get a wrong shade
you can really end up looking kind of
crazy so I don't know I'm kind of
particular about them so without ever
having likes watch this palette I can't
say for sure that I feel like the
contour would you know like absolutely
work for me I did say that they are also
releasing I think it just released like
a smaller version of this palette i
think it's called like the highlight
contour pro to go or something like that
I believe it's $23 and it comes with
three shades three shades that are in
the smaller one are all different from
the shades that are in the bigger one
which I thought was interesting I
thought they would like pick and choose
shades and then put it in the smaller
one but they appear to be all different
and I think they are also doing that
with their eye shadow palette with the
pro I shadow palette that they came out
with their looks to be a pro to go
eyeshadow palette as well which is a
little bit smaller and a little bit more
affordable I like that idea I really do
it intrigues me and so when I saw the
smaller one I was like hmm should I get
that to be able to try it out but
honestly I'm thing I'm going to pass
because I'm just like overloaded with
highlights right now I have so many I
have glow kids I've single highlights at
the champagne glow face palette which
has two highlights and they're like I
just have a lot of highlight right now
and I don't even wear highlight on a
daily basis anymore because I can have
like really bad issues with texture so
do i need to have even more highlights
kits add it to my collection at this
time no so that's kind of the main
reason i'm going to pass over it but
also it just didn't speak to me I say it
a lot in these will i buy videos every
product doesn't speak to me I don't need
to encourage myself to buy it because
there's so many other makeup products
that i want to buy i would rather go
with the one that really really speaks
to me but
I mean it definitely looks like a nice
palette like I said the bigger one is
$45 the smaller one I believe is 23 i
will leave both of them link down below
so maybe if you don't want to go all out
with the bigger one but you still want
to try it get the smaller one I like
that idea I think it's a good idea so
those will both be linked down below but
I will not be purchasing the tart pro
highlight and contour palette so the
next one I want to talk about is a new
product and this is from Kat Von D and
it's the locket brightening powder so
from the support website it says this is
a weightless tinted loose powder that
instantly brightens the under eye area
according to your skin tone and it says
it'll brand under eye area with less
weight and no cake it's supposed to be
light as air texture designed to smooth
and blur the crease prone under eye area
proving that you can actually use loose
powder around the eyes without adding
texture is all vegan not tested on
animals that's kind of like Kat Von D's
thing so it's $25 4.29 ounces and there
are three different colors that you can
get there is golden which is banana
yellow and for deeper skin tones there
is peach which is a warm bisque and
brains medium skin tones and then pedal
which is powder pink and it brightens
light skin tones so and each one is the
$25 so Kat Von D recently came out with
her locket like translucent powder and I
heard so many good things about it now I
typically do not use a translucent
powder all over my face I will typically
only bake on my under eyes and sometimes
like right here but I don't you
typically put translucent powder all
over my face if I feel like I need to
set my foundation to use the Maybelline
better skin powder or my peer
four-in-one mineral powder I know they
say that you're not supposed to put like
a foundation powder on top of like a
liquid foundation because it can you
make you up cake face but I've been
doing it forever and I've never had a
problem with it looks like this is what
I've done today I have a foundation on
and then i have the maybelline better
skin powder over it and it works just
fine for me I have tried the laura
mercier translucent powder that everyone
has lost their minds over and I hate it
it made me look like I a cake face and
it had flash back in photos so I I'm
like you know what I don't want to try a
translucent powder it doesn't work for
me I don't need it so when everyone was
raving about the new Kat Von D
translucent powder
that moment is like should I get it
should get it should I get it but like
no you know I don't feel like I need it
I do like having the under-eye powder I
have to laura mercier secret brightening
powder and I love it I love it I think
it's fantastic I use it all the time if
you watch my Instagram tutorials I'm
constantly using it i think it's great i
have a one from Maybelline and I think
it's okay it's not the laura mercier but
I've been getting down there on my Laura
Mercier and I was like you know what I
guess you know i'll just order another
one because you know i like it so much
so whatever when i start to run out i'll
just reorder that one but then I saw
that Kat Von D came out with this and I
was like now I kind of want to get that
because everyone you know kind of raved
about the translucent powder sounds like
why not try the under-eye potter and i
really liked that it had the three
different shades they could kind of pick
which one and so the one that i am
interested in is peach it says for
medium skin tones I mean I'm like oh
well I would like medium I'm trying to
get to my self tanning game but i have
used like peach on your I correctors
before I my under eyes and I thought it
worked out really well so that's kind of
why I went with the peach and yes I have
actually already bought this product as
well I am a vib rouge member at sephora
if you watched my sephora vib sale haul
I became vib rouge after that so I got
early access on Sunday night before
cyber monday a couple of products were
released for vib rouge members and the
kat von d locket powder was one of them
so i picked it up and I picked it up in
peach I don't have my package yet it
supposed to be coming soon i will do a
full video on this because i think it
looks very cool as of right now i'm so
disappointed that all of the shades are
sold out like it's just so frustrating
again I think this should be coming back
in stock because there's the little
button there that says email me when
this comes back so it should be coming
back in stock I don't know like why the
craziness is happening but I will
definitely let you guys know what I
think of it if I think it's worth it
kind of compared to my Laura Mercier but
I was excited about this one I thought
it was really cool that there was
different colors as well that you can
kind of pick and choose for your skin
tones I think it's cool so a lot of
people said really good things about the
translucent powder so I wanted to try
out the under
because that's what I tend to go for
when I'm like baking my face so I'll
keep you guys updated on that Kat Von D
Luckett brightening powder I will buy it
and I did buy it did anyone else get it
or are you interested in this one leave
it in the comments below ok then the
final products that I want to talk about
our from colour-pop cosmetics they came
out with like a peachy line so they have
the Just Peachy lip bundle and then they
also have the peachy keen eye shadow
foursome so I've been getting asked a
lot of questions about this and so I
wanted to talk about it and kind of talk
myself through it because this is one
that I am a little I'm shirt on so from
let's just go over the lip bundle first
so again this is called just peachy it
comes with three Lippi's so we have
instigator which is a mid-tone peachy
nude in a matte finish screenshot which
is a mid-tone nude peach and a satin
finish and speed dial which is a rich
peach in a matte finish and it is
fifteen dollars for the three lippies so
the ultra mats I'm a little disappointed
because there's two mats and only one
satin the satin finish from colour-pop
is like one of my favorite formulas I
used to love the mask until they came
out with the sentence and I was like
this is so much crazy better it's still
like a matte liquid lipstick but it's
not as drying on the lips it's just a
butter formula in my opinion so which
there was to statins 21 Matt but that's
okay like I said it's $15 you guys I
mean these shades are like my shades I
love peach I love love love peach so
this is like i said i did not know
before i start filming this video and i
knew i was going to talk about this one
because i've been asked some questions
on it I'm like I don't know but honestly
what these Lippi's I kind of want to get
them the only thing I'm very confused
about is is this limited edition it
doesn't say I've looked at their
Instagram it doesn't say I'm assuming
it's limited edition because of eighty
percent of what color pop puts out is
limited edition for whatever reason I've
never really understood that I try not
to buy too much limited edition I really
do try because it's frustrating to you
know talk about it and having tutorials
and other people
can't get it but these PG shades kind of
like look like me you know what I'm
saying like they just they look like me
so for the lippies I want to do it I
think I'll do it I want to look farther
in to see if I can see are they limited
edition if you know if they're limited
edition please leave it in the comments
below because that will make me think
twice about it but I just love like the
peach and the nude like that is my
favorite lip color that's what I
gravitate towards so fifteen dollars for
all three and I actually think I would
wear all three like I said I just wish
there was two sands on one mat because
the matte formula isn't my like super
favorite but I just I think that's a
really good deal so I'm interested in
that one and then the other thing that
they put out in this kind of set is the
peachy keen for some so you're getting
four of their eyeshadows so you have
crimper which is a soft gold with a
multi-dimensional gold glitter in a
metallic finish you have Kennedy which
is a true mid-tone peach in a matte
finish Cornelius which is a mid-tone
warm caramel in a matte finish to
captain lights collab with Cornelius
doesn't that sounds like a that sounds
like a kathleenlights collab but it
could be wrong and then bandit which is
a warm rusty brown with a matte finish
and these are all for eighteen dollars
ok so again I don't know hmmm through it
here I really like the peachy shades
again like I'm just I'm attracted to it
but color pop I shadows truly aren't my
favorite in order to get the best like
color payoff and pigmentation with color
pop shadows you have to use your fingers
versus a brush and I straight up don't
like using my fingers for makeup I don't
I don't enjoy it especially for
eyeshadows i have like long acrylic
nails and to stick my finger and
eyeshadow and then try to rub it on my
eye on like hitting myself in the nose
with my nail I don't like getting my
fingers dirty then after I do my makeup
I have to go wash my hands I just I
don't prefer putting I shadows on
especially with my fingers so I have
quite a few colour-pop shadows and I
very very rarely reach for them like I
have to like remind myself okay you
haven't used clutter pop in a while why
don't you use it because
otherwise i don't i just i don't like
applying with my fingers so for that
reason even though i really do like
these shadows I I don't think I would do
it just because i just do not reach for
color cup eyeshadows enough and I mean
eighteen dollars for for eyeshadows
that's not a terrible price and they are
good like when you apply with your
fingers they are good eye shadows I just
prefer not to do it you know and I know
that might sound silly to some people
but i also have a lot of eyeshadow
palettes that i can apply with brushes
just fine so you know i think i am going
to pass over the eyeshadow palette but
now that makes me want to consider the
Just Peachy lip bundle even more so I
think yeah I think I'm going to do the
Just Peachy lip on below if you guys
know if it's limited edition if you've
been able to see it somewhere because I
sure haven't I really haven't heard a
ton about the peach said it's been more
about their holiday sets that are coming
out if you want to see it will i buy it
on the colour-pop holiday sets let me
know it'll be lip bundle from colour-pop
i think will be a yes for me and then
the eyeshadow palette i think will be a
no have you gotten anything from the
peach line from colour-pop or will you
let me know in the comments down below
alright guys that's going to be it for
my latest will i buy it video I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
