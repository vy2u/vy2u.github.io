today's video is going to be a new will
I buy video I suppose my will I buy a
video every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about new makeup releases and
launches letting you know a little bit
about them and then loving you know if
I'm going to buy them or if I am NOT
going to buy them and why are my not and
my opinions and feedback on the products
like I said I do post these every single
Wednesday I do have a playlist so I will
have that link down below in case you
want to catch up on any of my past will
i buy videos in addition to my Wednesday
videos I do post on Thursdays Sundays
and Mondays so you do get videos from
uni four times a week so I hope that you
will consider hitting the subscribe
button and becoming a part of Sam I do
have a couple giveaways going on right
now as well for the Sephora give me some
nude lip said and also the Kim
Kardashian West and Kylie cosmetics lip
collection as well so those will both be
linked down in the description box if
you are interested in getting entered
but with all of my will advice videos I
have left to talk about
so why don't we go ahead and get started
okay so the first one that I'm going to
talk about I have never talked about
this brand before my would lie about a
video so I'm excited it got quite a few
tags on Instagram for these this is from
storybook at cosmetics and it is their
Rose brush set as always I will have
pictures link down here below and I'm
reading from the trend man Instagram I
often mention her in my video so I
always have her Instagram link down
below as well I go to her page like 10
times a day and see about new makeup
releases and she always has really good
information so she's also linked down
below but this brush set it includes
four brushes with a pouch it's $55 and
they have scarlet ombre cruelty free
synthetic bristles and gorgeous green
rowspan metal alloy candles each set
includes a tapered highlighting brush
and angled contour slash blush brush a
flat top powder brush and a dome top
powder brush plus the custom rose pouch
obviously if they look incredibly cool
I've never really seen brushes like this
I think storybook Cosmetics I'm not
super familiar with them I don't have
anything from them but I think they are
kind of known for these kind of like
unique brushes like they're named
storybook lips they take inspiration
from different stories when they are
making their makeup products which i
think is very cool and I
love that concept so it's $55 for four
brushes I don't know I don't like I want
to say I feel like that's expensive you
get the pouch as well and I was saying I
feel like it's expensive but then I
don't know if it really is all that
expensive I don't know makeup brushes
are hard for me because I love makeup
brushes I was just talking about some I
think it was in my morphe collection
video which if it's not out the eyes
I'll be going that very soon that's
lying about all of my morphe brushes and
saying how I feel these Marquis brushes
are always like the unknown MVPs they're
like the offensive line on the NFL team
protecting the quarterback with the
court records gets all the credit like
we get a good makeup application we get
a good you know blended eyeshadow
because of the brushes that we're using
and you know you don't feel like brush
skin enough credit sometimes so I have
like a very soft spot for brushes and I
have a huge weakness or brushes my brush
collection is insane because I just so
hard for me not to buy brushes so when I
saw these of course I was drawn to them
like do I need these but for me I'm
gonna have to go ahead and say no mostly
for the reason is because I just bought
D Tarte make believe in yourself brushes
disgust sent a unicorn brush set from my
makeup brush set to try out I just got
it I actually used them today to help
create this eye look and this I list
will be on Instagram that's where I do
all my makeup tutorials mostly it's on
my Instagram so that's always linked
down below and I also just got the Sigma
Beauty ultimate copper eye brush set
which came with 13 different brushes so
I really don't need any more brushes at
this moment oh and I just got the morphe
there rose copper copper rose brush set
my wonderful beautiful French jørgen
sent those to me and so yeah what I need
first before I buy more makeup brushes
is more makeup brush organization like I
need some I need some help with my
makeup brushes right now because what I
have for my brushes it's just like too
much oh and I just got with a huge
Russian tweezer man like you know I
don't need any makeup brushes right now
that need any and I don't know I guess
$55 for only for brushes I don't know it
was for some reason to me that sounds
expensive but I really don't know that
it is and they're all big face brushes
which I also love big brushes like big
brushes I just really enjoy so these all
definitely look like things that I
really do want but I try to think
logically it's kind of the point behind
the will I buy a video to talk it out to
just take a second you know not impulse
buy like we do so often tickets I can't
think about it think about logically
think about my makeup collection think
about my brush collection and I just
melt that I don't need any right now and
not only have I been sent brushes but
I've bought brushes and I know that I
just don't need them so as cool as they
look as much as I would love to have
them as pretty as they are I just don't
need them right now so I'm going to go
ahead and pass over them but I would
love to know if you guys are interested
in getting the rose brush set from a
storybook cosmetics have you purchased
anything else from storybook cosmetics
and what has been your feedback on the
company I would absolutely love to know
because I feel like I'm hearing more
about them lately but mostly just about
their releases I don't seen a lot of
people like reviewing from them so I'm
definitely curious and you guys have
anything from them so let us know in the
comments down below the next item I got
so many times on Instagram I'm like yeah
I see you guys I see what you guys are
doing so a lot of people are wondering
if I'm going to be getting at the morphe
brushes their prep and set makeup
setting spray this is new to more feet
is 14.99
I am hearing a lot about this makeup
setting spray a lot of people are saying
it was like glue for your makeup that it
is like just the best setting spray out
there I have had a recent obsession with
makeup sprays makeup mist setting sprays
like I don't know what my problem is
because I used to not like them I used
to talk about it and be like no I just I
don't really get them and I'll see what
they do anything and then something
switched in me and I'm like give me all
of the makeups right I don't know what
happened I have like five from pixie 2
from Scandinavia I'm looking at them
right now I have the Smashbox primer
water I have the pure hydrating mist I
have of course the mac fix+ Mario
Badescu as I said I don't know what
happened
and so when more
came out with their spray I'm looking at
my shelf I'm like do I need it no am I
going to get it yeah yeah I feel like
1499 is a little bit easier to talk
myself into than fifty five dollars if
you know what I'm saying even though I
probably use the brushes more but
seriously I've been hearing just
fantastic things about this morphe
setting spray I definitely have my eyes
on it I really want to get it
my problem with morphe is I'm that
person who like needs free shipping if
you're not going to offer me free
shipping like I get any kind of offended
in that person that spends an extra like
$60 you get the free shipping even
though I don't need to think you know
what I'm saying I I swear I set the meme
in here very often and I'll do it again
right now but that is me I don't know
what my problem is and I kind of wish
I'd like click myself out of it but a
lot of you guys say you're like it too
and on Marcy's website used to spend
$100 to get free shipping 100 bucks man
I'm like come on
you definitely have my eye on morphe
setting spray I just I'm hearing so many
good things about it I don't think 1499
is a bad price I really enjoy more feel
like I said if my more collection videos
have already else it will be soon and
you will probably be able to tell from
that video how much I enjoyed my face so
I plan on getting the setting spray but
I don't know for you guys are you guys
planning on getting it did you already
purchase it it is already for sale I
think it is still in stock at the time
that I'm filming it will all be linked
down below but let us know if you're
planning on getting it or if you've
already gotten it because I was loved
enough well the next one I was getting
quite a few tags on even got some
snapchat messages about this one is from
Anna Sophia Beverly Hills that she is
coming out with a new summer collection
I'm just going to be talking about the
blush trios in this will I buy that
video if there's anything else that you
want to see in future will i buy videos
let me know but as getting asked a lot
about the blush trios so these are $30
each they are permanent each one comes
with three different shades because it's
trio I will try to insert the best
photos then I can down here we available
May 16th on their website June 13th
online at other retailers and Inc stores
June 23rd full at Sephora Ulta and Metis
so I mentioned recently that I'm not a
big like blush person but
this is going to sounds like sickening
like when I have the thought in my mind
I was like oh gosh Samantha you got to
get it together girl
another day I was looking up blowing
make about to do an Instagram makeup
tutorial and I was like oh my gosh I
feel like I'm always using these same
blushes like I'm using the same blusters
over and over I was like I really need
to get some new blushes I'm like no you
don't like no you don't you have plenty
of blushes but it really did run through
my mind and another thing that I wanted
was a new bronzer even though I didn't
find a bronzer from number 7 and I
absolutely love it as in a favorites
video but I really really enjoy when my
blush and my bronzer are together I have
no idea why I have an elf blush and
bronzer duo from their app when fused
line and I love it I have the Clarins
trio that I talk about all the time it
has a contour shade slash bronzer a
blush and setting part take it
everywhere with me I love it use it all
the time
like I am just being really drawn to
palettes or the trios or the duo's and
in the past I never really was like I
would always say like oh I don't get a
blush palette I'm not a makeup artist I
don't need all these different blushes
and now I'm like oh a blush trail from a
massage a Beverly Hills do you say hmm
so I think I just thought that was very
interesting but you know definitely our
wants and our needs our interests change
all of the time and so I don't know I
guess I just wanted to throw that out
there unless you guys know that because
that was a thought that really ruins in
my mind like I wish I had more blush
bronzer like together in a palette or
you know in a duo or trio so when I saw
these from Australia come up I got
really interested now they do say that
they're all flushed real but there are a
few of them that I feel like I could use
some of the shades as a bronzer so what
I really want to do is take a peek a
little bit harder I know some people are
going PR packages hopefully some like
videos will be coming out with some
really good swatches because I think I
want to get one where I
have a really good blush and then also
hopefully somewhat of a bronzer tone in
there I don't know for sure if it's
going to work I'm just going off some of
the photos that I've seen on Instagram
right now but that is my hope and if I
think that I can make that work I think
I will take one out I don't think thirty
dollars is a bad price for the three
different shades and the packaging does
look really nice and of course it's a
Nastasia so of course we know it can be
a little bit pricier I haven't seen if
they come with a mirror and I really
wish that they did is anybody know if
these come with a mirror from the photos
that I see I don't see a mirror and
reading the descriptions I don't see
anything about a mirror so I'm assuming
there's not which is a bit of a bummer
like she never puts her mirrors or puts
mirrors and in her little tips either
and like we saw mirrors like what are
you doing but I'm kind of leaning
towards getting one of these but let me
know your guys have thoughts down below
did these catch your attention do you
think this is something that you need
I'd love to know what's up skaters it's
exactly what you think but I definitely
want to talk about them because they did
catch my interest
they are coming out shortly maybe 16 so
they should be already out by the time
this video goes up so I'll link down saw
a website below I think that's where
they'll be
until our June 13th but yeah I'm
definitely curious about them and I also
want to tell you guys that I had that
moment the other day like I need more
blush and bronzers and the new media
recap horrified with myself like no you
don't girlfriend I think what I need is
better organization if you guys follow
me on snapchat you know I'm trying
really hard to like reorganize my office
because I think one of my problems is
I'm putting makeup in drawers and not
seeing them and I'm forgetting about
them and I need things like out in the
open and then I won't forget about other
things so those where I'm at right now
thinking about picking up on the on
Sophia blush trio let us know in the
comments down below what you think and
if you're going to be picking one up as
well and the last item that I'm a
talking about in the suits lily-white
video has been definitely the one that
I've gotten the most questions on on
every single platform snapchat Instagram
Twitter and then of course my YouTube
views a lot of people were asking me
about the new collection from Tarte
cosmetics and I'm like okay I get it
so it's going to be new additions to
their Amazonian clay line so from Tarte
cosmetics they're going to be coming out
with the Amazonian clay sticks on beige
and it's going to be in 12 different
shades they're going to be $39 apiece
it's smoothing a blender foundation
brush for $28 the clay play palette ugly
is an eyeshadow palette does this like
shapewear for your face tournament
doesn't have the price listed on that
one but let me see if I can find it also
able to block of base foundation for
your eyes to use as an eyeshadow primer
and then the gifted mascara with
matching limited-edition s packaging it
will be available May 21st on the Tarte
website so I select the two things that
most people were asking me about was the
stick foundation and then also the clay
play palette so I'm going to touch on
those in this video but that is the new
additions that are coming to the tarte
amazonian clay line so the stick
foundation 12 different shades $39 I'm
all about it I'm all about it I'm super
excited I'm very excited for this line I
just love Tarte cosmetics they have to
be I mean like in my top three favorite
brands I really enjoy them I feel like
so many things that I get from that I am
just not disappointed in and not to say
not everything because there are some
things from Tarte that I wasn't like a
super huge fan of but I just feel like
so many things impressed me from that
line and I'm just very intrigued about
the stick foundation I've been getting a
little bit more into stick foundation
but on snapchat so I've been seeing a
lot about this new line I've been seeing
the swatches of the foundations and
people playing the foundations on and
I'm very very interested in it $39 I do
not feel like is a bad price for
foundation so I definitely am very very
interested in getting this foundation of
course a bunch know what you guys think
you guys like stick foundations do you
like the top foundations I recently
picked up the Tarte rainforest of the
sea foundation in the Sephora VAV feel
I'm wearing it right now and I
absolutely love it love it I have to
shave tape I have to reform C concealer
like I really liked tarts face products
I enjoy our primers a lot like I'm just
real excited about that so I definitely
have my eye on the stick foundation I
think I'm going to pick up a shade for
myself but of course what's up to know
this
catch your guys's radar as well I feel
like you probably did because of the
amount of questions I was getting but of
course I would love to know your
feedback in the comments and then for
the clay play palette now this is going
to be $46 when I thought for your $6 I
was like ooh is that a little bit pricey
but the clay play palette has me super
super intrigued because it's not just an
eyeshadow palette it's supposed to be
like a contour palette but for your
whole face which has me immediately all
kind of excited it kind of reminds me a
little bit of like the Kat Von D shade
and light palette how they're supposed
to be like contours for your eyes to be
it's kind of similar in that concept
because we have like our shadow shapes
that will help you know bring out your
eyes and there's also shades for your
entire face and complexion in there
which I just find super intriguing salt
have a best photo that I can find link
down below but the shades definitely
have any super intrigued and I like it
because I always talk about how like I'm
a busy girl on the go and I like things
to be all together in one I'm just
talking about it with like the blush
palette and I like the blush and the
bronzer in this ending product you know
I like the palace and the trio's and
that's much more what I'm gravitating
towards and especially as I'm was
traveling more they're easy to travel
with and I mean this is going to be so
many different items in one and I even
was reading on a lure like people are
saying there's certain shades in there
like you could use on your eyebrows you
know I'm not going to use my eyebrows
because that's not the way that I roll
but you can use them as like I brought
powders as well and I'm just finding
this super super intriguing I have my
eye on the collide Playa palette from
Tarte as well so this is quite a little
abayas
um but yeah I just was super excited
about that the more to write about it
and the more I've been seeing it in
action on the Tarte snapchat like I'm
just super curious about this I would
absolutely love to try it
that's all from the Amazonian clay line
it's like super good ingredients in
there which I also really appreciate and
I know that's what Tarte is you know
really really known for so I'm just
super excited about it so both the
foundation and the eyeshadow palette
having all kinds of excited I would love
to know what you guys want me to get
these and do like a review on them once
they hit the Tarte website like I could
get them from the Tarte website and do
some early reviews
let me know what you think if you guys
would be interested in seeing that but I
am super curious about these I
definitely have both of them on my radar
so let me know what you think about the
clay play palette as well down below
yeah definitely got my eyes on these new
Tarte products super excited awesome
tarts one of my favourite brands but let
me know in the comments down below which
you are most excited about from these
new additions to the Tarte collection I
