video is going to be a new little will I
buy it I post my bill about videos every
single Wednesday where I'm talking about
some new makeup releases and lunches
letting you know some details on them
and then also talking about whether I'm
going to pick them up or if I'm going to
pass over them so I always have elapsed
to chat about in these videos so don't
we go ahead and get started alright the
first item that I'm going to talk about
is a newer release from elf cosmetics
it's been out for a little bit now but
I'm still continually getting asked
questions about this one so it's
actually a lip gloss that is in
collaboration with Alyssa actually
Alyssa Ashley is a youtuber I found her
after her subculture review the her
subculture review kind of like it took
off and I've been watching some of her
videos after seeing that review video
she's very beautiful and that's super
exciting that she's coming out with the
collaboration with elf cosmetics so a
huge congratulations to her so this is a
nude rosy lip gloss it is only six
dollars from ELF like thank you elf for
still keeping your prices more
affordable for drugstore makeup and what
I'm hearing is that it's supposed to
actually be somewhat of a dupe for the
Fenty lip gloss or the lip balm from a
Fenty Beauty which I just mentioned in
my Sephora vib sale video that I was
interested in picking it up I am
interested in getting this lip gloss
from ELF and Alyssa actually I actually
placed an all-too order about a week or
so ago and I was looking for it because
elf is available online at Ulta I was
looking for it on the Ulta website and I
was pretty bummed when I didn't see it
there and it looks like you can only get
this on the elf website and then also in
elf stores which I do not have any elf
stores in Iowa unless somebody knows of
the store here in the Midwest but you
can tell me about but I don't think we
have any elf stores around here I would
like to get this one especially because
I think I am going to get the Fenty lip
gloss and I would kind of like to see a
comparison for myself $18 versus the $6
which is it going to be so I actually
went on to the Alpha website and I'm
thinking about maybe doing some sort of
like elf haul in the future there's a
couple items here and there that I've
seen on the Alpha website and they just
came out with a ton of new releases as
well
they released like 30 different new item
in the month of September it was so
crazy so I was actually thinking about
maybe doing that and then I could pick
up the lip gloss at the same time the
lip gloss isn't necessarily something
that I was like I need to run out and
get this right away and you know only
purchase this one item from the elf
website like I said if it would have
been available at Ulta I would have
merged it in with my previous order that
I was doing but I am still interested in
getting it doesn't look gloss is
supposed to be like making it come back
and it's supposed to be you know the new
trend so I've been trying more and more
I'm such a matte lipstick lover but I've
been trying more and more to get into
the lip gloss trend and this one does
look a really beautiful and for only six
dollars I feel like you can't go wrong
with that
so I'm still interested in picking it up
but I'd love to know since it has been
out for a while now who has picked it up
but what do you think about it have you
seen like you have the fenty lip gloss -
do you think it would be a - mm-hmm well
let me know but I am definitely
interested in the health and Alyssa
actually it look less so the next item I
was getting on quite a few tags on is a
new release from a storybook cosmetics
in collaboration with Mean Girls this is
called the burn book eyeshadow palette
and includes 12 colors it will be
available on November 1st at 10 a.m. PST
I believe on the turbo Cosmetics a
website I'm praying from Jenna and one
so I will have her Instagram a page
linked down below since I typically get
some information from her Instagram so I
have been tagged on a ladder from
storybook cosmetics in the past I think
I featured them quite a few times in the
will i buy it videos they are a company
that is kind of known for these
collaborations like this one with mean
girl I think the most recent one they
did was like Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory and I know I kind of talked to
some you guys in the comments and over
other social medias about how
interesting it is that they can kind of
get this trademarked and licensing and
all of that for their for their makeup
products and I do I think that's pretty
interesting but a lot of times that
means that they do have higher prices so
for this palette for example I couldn't
find an exact price on this one yet even
though it's releasing just a couple days
from now but looking at their website
like the Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory one was $55 then another
eyeshadow powder on the website that was
$55 so I'm going to assume that this one
is $55 which to me that seems pretty
see but a lot of people are always
chattering about using like the exact
trademarked information from these
movies and all of that so that's kind of
why they have to have higher pricing
because the licensing and you know all
the legal jeopardy that goes into all of
that so I get it and I like the concept
and I think a lot of their stuff is
super cute like the Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory eyeshadow palette
definitely caught my attention but I
keep talking myself out of it because it
just seems like a lot of money too you
know to have almost kind of like a
collector piece I think I totally get it
if you're like a huge ride-or-die fan
for whatever it is collaboration that
they are doing I think it definitely
makes sense then if you would want to
get that as the collector's piece but I
guess they haven't come out with
anything yet that I'm like I have to
have that because like obviously I know
what Mean Girls is I've seen the movie
several times I could quote several the
lines from the movie but I'm like not a
ride-or-die Mean Girls fan when I see it
on TV I can skip over it you know like
whereas with like the movie elf I mean
anytime
elf is on TV I'm like sitting down
watching it even if it's June like I
don't care so I don't know what would
you guys what would you say if spur boat
cosmetics was to do a collaboration and
it would be like your one thing what
would it be because I think I'm gonna
have to say mine would be like clueless
I'm probably about clueless eyeshadow
palette cuz like clueless that was my
jam so the colors in there I mean they
definitely look pretty and they have
some fun colors in there and this like
shiny green and a pretty blue and all of
that but again I just I don't think it's
enough of a pull for me I'm just not
that Mean Girls hardcore diehard fan for
the movie and I think that means that I
can go ahead and skip over paying fifty
five dollars for a 12 payin I shadow
palette you know because I think you're
paying not only for the collaboration
but also the packaging is really really
cool and not gonna take anything away
from that packaging is definitely very
fun inside also but I think that's kind
of also where the $55 is coming from so
so I'm gonna keep my eye on storybook
cosmetics and maybe one day they'll come
out with that release that I'm like
that's for me but so far it hasn't
happened yet but let us know are you
such a huge Mean Girls fan who is your
favorite character in the movie
you have to get the burn book a shadow
palette I would love to know so next up
I was getting quite a few tags on this
new release with BH Cosmetics they are
doing another collaboration of with
Beauty influencer of Shan EXO they did
release a collab palette a while back
with one side was eyeshadows and then
one side was a lip palette I'm not sure
I feel like I talked about this in a
will I buy it or maybe an anti haul
video but I said I wasn't interested in
getting it because I actually don't like
lip palettes I don't feel like they're a
good fit for me so it didn't really seem
worth it to buy something that was half
of a product that I wouldn't use but
they are coming out with the remix or
the round 2 collaboration and this is a
double sided eyeshadow palette so
similar packaging to the first release
except now both sides are going to be
eyeshadows and there are nine shadows on
each side so you get eighteen shades in
total you can get two BH Cosmetics on
the Alpha website and the original
palette is still on there for fourteen
fifty but I didn't see this new palette
there I can only find it on the BH
website looks like it is 1899 for the
eighteen shades then I also noticed that
it did say that this was a limited
edition introductory price so I'm not
sure how much longer it's going to be
only the 19 dollars for and what price
it will be going up to that I'm not 100%
on but it is available now on the BH
site so I will have that linked down
below now I am going to be passing over
this one I am NOT hugely familiar with
Anik so I've seen a couple of her videos
but a lot of times with collaborations I
get excited to buy collab pieces because
I like to support the people that I
watch you know very frequently and you
know on somewhat of a regular basis not
saying that's only my ever reason to get
a collaboration because one of my most
loved palettes is the Tarte and styled
by her brush palette and I didn't know
who her Roush was and I didn't buy the
palette because of her at all I just
really like the palette and I thought it
looked interesting that can be a reason
why I buy collaborations so the collab
aspect it didn't necessarily give me a
pull I do like BH Cosmetics I have
purchased a lot from them especially in
the past they're a great affordable
brand and they have a lot of good
quality pieces but not everything it
necessarily always catches my attention
from them I think really the biggest two
reasons I would say why I'm not going to
get the palette
one is that we are
searching Sephora vib bill time so I'm
getting my list ready for their you know
I'll have a big order coming in from
Sephora and then also typically around
the VIP sale time also starts really
stepping up their game it's if they know
a lot of people are gonna be placing
orders at Sephora so they're like five
times points on this extra bonus points
on this free shipping on this these
deals over here but ah so I'm really
looking at Sephora and also like heavily
right now because that's where the deals
and the discounts are to be had and I
know that I'm going to be purchasing a
lot of makeup here coming up so that's a
big reason but another one is that it
just said give me a double take I talked
about the double take or having a strong
week are having a strong reaction to
make up in these villa buy it videos
because my feeling is that if you don't
have a strong reaction to something
don't talk yourself into it just move on
there's always so much makeup out there
and if you don't want to purchase
something then you don't have to because
there's probably gonna be something else
that you would want it to purchase more
so even though I don't think $19 is a
bad price at all forgetting that
eyeshadow palette it just didn't give me
a strong enough reaction and then
knowing how much money I'm going to be
spending on makeup here in the next
coming week or so I know that I need to
just pass over anything it that doesn't
give me a strong pull so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over this palette but I
would love to know did you pick up the
first one are you super excited for the
second one I'll have someone in the
comments ready so tart is coming out
with some exciting and new releases here
I was going to ask a lot of questions
about this one especially on my Twitter
for this one it seemed like so first
thing that I will say is that the Tarte
tartlet toasted palette is now available
at both Sephora and Ulta so I'll have
that link down below I did mention this
and I will I buy it a couple weeks back
and I said I was so excited for it and I
was going to purchase it on the chart
website like the minute it became
available and I was super pumped for it
and I've been getting asked a lot of
questions of where's my review video
where's my tutorial videos I ended up
not purchasing from the Tarte website
because a few days before it released I
found out that they had some sort of
strange security breach security issue
on their website and that kind of gave
me a spook so I was pretty bummed about
it but you know I was like it's going to
be coming just for an Ulta just hold on
you don't need to get a pallet the exact
day that it launches life will go on and
it will be okay but
you know I'm someone who's dealt a lot
of times with my credit card information
being stolen identity theft of things
like that so I get pretty spooked when I
hear things like that I've mentioned it
in past videos of Hawaii I haven't
bought from certain brands and their
websites because of security issues so
that is why you haven't seen my tartlet
toasted review or any tutorials on it
because I have been waiting for it to
come into stores just because I got a
little unsure if I should order from the
Tarte website but now that it is going
to be available at Sephora I'm gonna
pick it up during the vib sale so I'm
pretty excited about that but it is now
available at Sephora and Ulta so they
have a couple new releases it looks like
a few of these are maybe gonna be Ulta
exclusives I was trying to read I'm you
know reading from the tread mood website
and it just is the link at Ulta but the
first one is the toasted palette which
is $46 but that is available on the SPO
website now but the Park Avenue princess
highlight and contour palette it's gonna
be $46 I could only find this one at the
Ulta website but I am so excited about
this one it has six different shades and
there it's a really beautiful palette I
love the packaging and I definitely want
to pick this one up I already have it in
my Ulta bag for when I make my purchase
I love highlighting contour palette I
really enjoy Tarte as a brand the clay
play palette has a couple face powders
in there and I really really love that
palette so when I saw that this one was
an all face palette I'll highlight
contour palette I was immediately like
we are for each other and I'm super
excited about that one they did release
a new lip paint the tortoise lip paint
which is $20 and per cap princess I'm
gonna pass over that I know I'm gonna be
buying some lipsticks in the VIP sale
and they're not my absolute like number
one favorite formula they also released
a chrome paint a shadow pots and three
shades for $22 each I don't really love
these types of eyeshadows like
especially the packaging I've had ones
from like Maybelline and Revlon and I
think even like L'Oreal and they're just
not my favorite type of packaging I
don't feel like I need it especially
with some other eyeshadow palettes I
want to pick up during the sale
definitely don't need it but then they
also have a couple different salt sets
coming out one is that Ulta and then one
I found at Sephora so the one that is at
Ulta it's the tartlet vault it's a
hundred dollars it'll be online only and
inside you get the Tarte lip matte
palette the tarlatan bloom and the
turlet toasted palette so all of those
for $100 I think each of the palettes
run
for $46 each i want to say i'm not going
to get the vault because i already own
the in bloom palette and then i am
planning on getting the toasted palette
in the VIP sale for a discount and to be
honest i don't even know what the
tartlet matte palette is i've never i've
never even heard of that one i'm
assuming it's an older palette maybe but
I just wouldn't need to get the vault
with already having two of the eyeshadow
palettes if that makes sense so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass over that one
but the one I found at Sephora looked
pretty interesting as well this is
called the TARDIS pro vault though
inside you get the TARDIS pro palette
also the highlight and contour palette
mascara eyeliner false lashes lip gloss
and a lipstick and that is all going to
be a hundred and forty eight dollars it
says it's a $197 value I'm pretty sure
that tarts the pro palette I think
that's like a fifty five dollar palette
I've heard good things about that
palette but I've talked myself out of it
and I think I mentioned it in a makeup
that I didn't regret not buying
I wasn't pulled enough towards it and
even though I still hear good things
about the palette it just didn't catch
my attention enough to buy I also do
hear good things about the highlight and
contour palette again with purchasing
the park a princess highlighting contour
palette I wouldn't really need it I have
the liner I have the mascara I have the
lashes and I have quite a few of the
Tarte lip paints so it's kind of a thing
where I have a lot of the pieces in here
so I wouldn't need to spend one hundred
and forty eight dollars on the vault but
if you want to try tart or you've been
eyeing some of these specific items in
here with either of the vault I mean
they definitely are a discounted price
so I think that's pretty cool so I'll
have all those products linked down
below the both products listed down
below as well but I got asked a lot of
questions on those but the two things
that I'll be getting from these new tart
releases are the Tosa pellet finally and
then also the park app princess
highlight and contour palette so I'm
pretty excited about that but I would
love to know what you're planning on
getting from these new tower leases if
you're planning on getting anything at
all
