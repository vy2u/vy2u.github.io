today's video what's going to be my will
I buy it I post my below I buy at videos
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about new makeup releases
letting you know a little bit about them
my thoughts on them and if I'm planning
to pick them up or if I'm gonna pass
over them and I do have a lot to show
about this week so why don't we go ahead
and get started all right so I do want
to say that I'm filming this on Friday
I don't normally film my videos my will
about videos thus far in advance but I'm
going to be out of town for a couple
days next week so I want to make sure I
have everything filmed and ready to go
if you don't know we are an army family
so a bunch of my immediate family
including my mom actually lives in
Alabama I live in Iowa but my mom is up
in Iowa again for the summer visiting
she has sisters and such that lived back
here in Iowa as well so I get to go up
do it's couple hour drive for me next
week when I get to see her and visit
with her and my little brother and I'm
really excited about that so in order to
have some days off to spend with them
means I'm pre filming and trying to get
everything ready so I can just relax and
hang out so and so if something comes
out over the weekend or early next week
normally I would be able to put that if
I will advise but just so you know if
you're like why did you not talk about
that it's because the video has already
been filmed so I just want to throw that
out okay so I was getting a bunch of
tags on this one from dubious place I'm
not gonna lie I was a little confused at
first as to what exactly it was but on
the dubious place Instagram it says
magic palette resize alert due to
requests from customers to keep our
palettes more travel friendly the magic
palette pan size is now 20 6.5 mm which
is the same size as the pants in the
nubian palette still a huge palette if
you ask us so I think it's just the
magic pellet it's just kind of like
shrunk down a little bit I don't have
the original magic palette so I'm not
exactly sure how large it is but you
know that's that's pretty cool that
they're listening to a bunch of the
requests and made it a little bit
smaller easier for travel but that's
fantastic
I believe it's $25 if I didn't already
say that so I mean I fit from what I
understand it's not necessarily a new
palette it's just new a new size but I
was getting some tags on it I don't
think that I need this particular
palette I do like that it's smaller I do
- I do like smaller
palates especially for traveling instead
of carrying something too big or too
bulky but just kind of looking at the
inside of the magic palette I think that
I have a lot of these shades kind of
across the dubious placed palettes that
I already own because I do have quite a
few of them the siharan the siharan to
the deuce or deuce a pallet the festival
palettes I still like I'm most
interested right now in the warrior
pallet from dubious plays that one did
sell out which I was very sad at but I'm
still I that one so I kind of want that
one before I got this one but but yeah I
mean that's that's pretty cool I enjoy
brands that listen to their customers so
that's great speaking of let's move over
to the next one that people were tagging
me on so Tarte cosmetics is coming out
with a new collection and they are
coming out with the new trust and fairy
dust collection
what does trust and fairy dust I thought
it was just called the fairy collection
Oh what do I know
so it has an eye and cheek palette for
$39 a brush set for 42i mascara for 23
fairy dust or glitters for nine dollars
double duty lipsticks for $18 a magnetic
palette for 17 a blush is $29 they have
a concealer brush for 24 or you can buy
the entire thing for a hundred and ten
dollars okay so what what I will say is
that I don't like to be mean or too
negative when it comes to certain things
because our people going to be
interested in this collection
yes are people going to apply this
collection yes do people like these
kinds of things do they like these kinds
of say shades yes yes to all of that so
I really try especially in my will I buy
up videos to not be too negative towards
something to not like laugh and poke fun
and and make fun of something that's
coming out because I know that there are
people out there who do like that I'm a
neutral fan myself and so I know like
sometimes when people are
too much on neutral is boring and all
these different things like I'm like it
doesn't have to be though I mean you
know what I mean so I've really tried
hard not to do that in my videos but I
can't lie when I say that when I saw
this from Tarte I kind of had to do the
eye roll because I I'm so surprised that
they're coming out with this still after
the April Fool's debacle and still
people being like Tarte are you gonna
make that palette that you thought was a
joke but instead they're coming out with
a fairy with the fairy dust or something
collection I mean it just is really
surprising to me the palette that
they're coming out with
looks exactly to me like what they just
came out with with Aspen over a very
neutral palette I think it was an eye
and cheek palette as well I mean it just
it just to me shows that Tarte just
continues to be out of touch with people
and I have to say I got a little bit
frustrated in the video that I did post
about makeup that I wear the most off
camera I mentioned at Tarte lipstick in
there and I said you know tarts been
doing some things lately that aren't
impressing me I'm not talking about them
a lot my videos I'm not wearing a lot of
their products in my videos etc and
basically left it from there and someone
commented and said you need to get over
the shade range it's so tiring listening
to people complain about the shade range
other brands do that do it too blah blah
blah and I'm like I don't know at what
point in my video that I said I'm upset
with Tarte over the shade range did it
help
no but if you go back and you watch my
videos you you were seeing Tarte in
products that I regret buying I was
talking about products from Tarte that I
was returning with the clay play was at
the clay you know the park of princess
the clay play to palette debacle all of
these different things were happening
and I was already thinking that tart was
being lazy a little bit unmotivated out
of touch with their consumers and what
what some people were requesting and I
know that again there's a large spectrum
of what people want but I'm sorry you
can't tell me that after releasing the
April Fool's joke and seeing how upset
people were and how many people wanted
that pal
you just brush it off and you keep going
on with all of these other things and I
know tart is a bigger brand of course
and they probably have a lot of these
already in the works but I mean to me it
just is another thing that made me say
like you made the right decision and
what you decided to do a tart because
there's been so many things for so many
months that I'm like they're just
they're just not listening or they don't
care I don't know but it's just as super
frustrating to me so I just have to say
when I saw that collection come out I
was time to just like really what I mean
where is that palette that that you guys
were making fun of you know I mean it
just is so it's so surprising to me so
that's kind of my thoughts on it so I'm
not really gonna get into the whole
collection because I'm not interested in
in anything it's just disappointing to
see though because Tarte really used to
be one of my favorite brands I bought so
much from them it's why I was buying you
know the products that I ended up
returning I was really upset when I was
returning some of them because I was
like what is going on here like you
really just put it a couple different
shades into your original play play
palette and tried to pass off with
something new really like you guys
that's what you guys are doing there
with her um so it's just frustrating so
when I saw that I just I had to get a
little bit frustrated but again are
there gonna be people that are excited
for it that like those colors that are
going to buy that yes I get that and I
know that I'm not gonna be one of them
but it just continues to make me not
very impressed
what tart let's move on to happier
subjects I don't like talking about
things that make me angry but colour-pop
is coming out with foundation I thought
it was really weird that no one tech
tree hostess I'm just kidding I don't
know what I was doing was that my
computer for a while and I locked in
that Instagram I was like tag after tag
after tag and all I think when I see
that it's like what came out and it was
the colour-pop foundation so they're
coming up the no filter foundation they
also have the no filter concealer that's
already out it has 42 shades it's going
to be $12 so it's lightweight formula
medium to full coverage with a matte
finish it's gonna be available on June
14th I'm really excited about this quite
honestly
the no filter concealer didn't quite
work for me but only because I got the
most terrible shade ever for me it's
like six shades too light for me I just
use it for my crease like I used it
today for this look that's about all
that I can use it for because it's way
too light on me so I can't really like I
really thought not really fair to judge
something just solely based on shade but
I'm pretty excited about this so it has
a pump on it it looks like it has oh I
make 42 shades it looks like it has a
pretty decent range for the shades
twelve twelve dollars like Colette oh so
medium to full coverage that makes me
happy matte finish I'm kind of like I
feel like everybody's coming out with a
matte foundation right now which isn't
my absolute babe I prefer more dewy or
more luminous but it's okay I can get
over it I'm probably gonna go ahead and
try this though I wanted to pick up one
of their face duos I don't know if the
perception palette is back again but I
still want to get the perception palette
from shale I know it's sold out because
I tried to buy it the night that it sold
out I think I was like an hour late or
something and then trying the foundation
so I'm probably gonna pick it out you
know $12 isn't like too bad of a risk
hopefully I do a better job of my
this time I did see that kathleenlights
posted a video review for it this
morning that I'm filming I haven't been
able to watch it yet but I have it like
I'm planning on watching it I know that
she like works really closely with
colour-pop but hopefully she would still
give an honest review but I think
they're sending out PR kids so I'm you
know I'll watch and see maybe someone
will do like shade swatches or whatever
so I can see what shade would be the
best for me because if the hard thing
with color pop is since they are so
affordable you can't do exchanges or
returns so like if you're stuck with
something like if you get something you
don't like you're stuck with it but you
know twelve dollars like that's not the
worst thing ever but I'm really excited
for this that's really cool to see them
to see colour-pop keep growing and keep
putting out new products and honestly
I'm just excited to see them with a
brand new product instead of like coming
out with something that's like super
super similar but just a little bit
different then you know another product
that they hope they do that a lot like
their eyeshadows and
I love six it's like every time they
come out with a collection that has like
ten new lipstick colors you're like how
how are these different from all of the
other lipstick shades you have so I have
to say it's pretty exciting to see brand
new products I know they also have like
a blotting powder and I think a loose
powder as well but honestly I was
getting so many tags on the foundation
and that's really what I'm most
interested in loose powders don't get me
going too much and setting powders I've
just bought the Charlotte Tilbury
and also been new urban decay so I'm
like no good and so I think I'll just
pick up one of the new foundations and
try it out but I'm pretty excited about
that I think you guys were pretty
excited about that too based on the
number of tags but I'd love to know if
you're planning on picking it up I just
have one more thing to chat about I
think last week was kind of a longer
video so maybe it's not a bad thing that
I'm filming so early I only have a
couple things to chat about but you know
speaking of the Tarte April Fool's joke
I feel like I've seen a couple of indie
brands come out with you know palettes
inspired by that palette because
obviously a lot of people were really
excited for it and on it to buy it and
now we have another one so this is the
face candy
makeup and this is their Atlantis
palette so it says twelve shades with
different finishes for $14 and it's
gonna be available at June 12th on shop
hush
and so I mean this palette it looks
really cool so it's got the blues and
there's that the greens in there and
some of these lighter tones it's got
Matt Sagat it's got shivers it's $14
that's pretty cool I think a lot of
people are gonna buy this about it I
really do
I'm also interested in it as well I
would like it just because I remember I
was on vacation when the the Moses
called the icy fetch Fiasco was coming
out and I was like not totally on social
media ton like I was trying to enjoy my
vacation but like so many people were so
excited and then they realize it was
April Fool's they were so mad and that's
getting text on all of it and I was like
what is happening here like I couldn't I
was like I need a Wi-Fi connection right
now you know on the Grand Canyon like I
need a Wi-Fi connection but you know
just knowing how many people were
excited for it I got excited when I saw
the first photos because it took me a
second to realize that it was just a
joke but I was like oh that would be
such a cool palette to have
and now we got someone else is doing it
so this one looks pretty nice I'm not
gonna lie what do you guys think of it
though
what what do you think are you happy
that other brands are coming out the
palette like this are you still like
waiting to see if Tarte releases that
pilot like you're holding on to that
hope are you planning on getting this
one from Shah hush let us know I'm
pretty interested in this one too it
looks like just a really nice colorful
palette but I think this one will
probably be pretty successful if I had
to guess but other than that guys that
is going to do it but the speaks will I
buy a video I guess I was going to do it
for this week's will i buy it video as
always let me know what has your
attention and what you were saying no -
