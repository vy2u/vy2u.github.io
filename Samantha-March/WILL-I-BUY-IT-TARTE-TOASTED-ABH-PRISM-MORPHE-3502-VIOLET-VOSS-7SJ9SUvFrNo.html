today's video is going to be a new of
what I buy it I post my will i buy it
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
talking about some new makeup releases
and launches letting you know a little
bit about them and then letting you know
if I'm planning to pick them up or pass
over them this week we have four
eyeshadow palettes to talk about because
eyeshadow palettes rule the world so if
you are ready for this week's a will
about video why don't I go ahead and get
started okay so the first eyes shadow
palette that we're going to talk about
is a from violet boss this is their
rainbow palette it's going to have 10
shimmery shades it is a $30 and it looks
like in here out and sort of a photo in
here but we have you know yellow and
purple and pink and blue a couple
different blues greens blacks everything
is shimmery rainbow a wonderful
beautiful these are not the type of
palettes that I reach for on a super
consistent basis I actually do own is it
one or two all shimmer palettes and a
lot of times of what I'm doing is I'm
reaching into them for just that one
shade I just want that one you know
shade topper I want but that one sparkly
shade on top of my lid I want something
for my inner corner or brow bone but I
don't reach into them a ton I like
having them there I enjoy the fact that
they're there but I don't reach for them
a lot so I don't need to pad my
collection with items like that and I
certainly don't need to spend $30 on
something that you know I'm maybe gonna
reach for once a month for one shade
that's not a really practical purchase
for me and you know if I look at these I
see a lot of shades that I already have
that deep blue that deep purple those
you know they remind me immediately of
the Jaclyn hill palette you know the
shimmery pink I have that the gold I
have that you know and even these like
blues and greens again reminds me of the
drekman help out it I have those shades
so I don't need another palette I mean
do we really need no but again we're
talking about makeup so we don't have to
be like super serious here I don't feel
like I don't need that I don't
necessarily want that because I know
that it's not going to be a super
practical purchase so I know that I can
go ahead and skip over it so I'm not
gonna be purchasing the violet vasa
palette I have tried violet boss I have
for her Holy Grail palette I was wearing
it in yesterday's video I believe it was
the all brown matte look love the holy
grail pal
and I was very impressed with the violet
boss shadows I thought I tried in there
so I do think that it could be a good
purchase these are tips of colors and
shades that you tend to gravitate
towards or if you just love violet boss
and you want to collect all of the
eyeshadow palettes from that brand let
us know your feedback in the comes down
below but for me personally I want to be
passing over that one if my lighting is
changing we're having one of those like
doing water storm today I don't know
maybe I do so the weather is kind of
doing some funky things out there I'm
just using my natural lights today and
in the process of getting ready to paint
my room so I have a lot of my lights
already moved out of here and I was just
hoping we got some sunny weather this
week but pretty soon your to be singing
I changed it to the red office that's
getting a makeover this weekend which
I'm super super excited about but
apologize if the lighting is a little
bit crazy at the moment but next up I
mean I don't even feel like I'm going in
a particular order here a lot of times
with my lullaby videos I kind of start
with the least requested item and then
my way up to the most requests that I
know I'd this week it was just like this
week I just couldn't keep up this was a
crazy week except morphe brushes is
going to be coming out with a new
eyeshadow palette this is called the 3
502 so the 3 502 second-nature from the
morphe Instagram it says off the chart
weren't just fiery smoking hot neutrals
and says it's to celebrate two years
since their game-changing 3 500 natural
glow palette burst onto the scene so
they are creating the 3 500 - it's going
to be for sale on October 12 and it's
going to be $23 I do own the original 3
500 I think it's pretty interesting that
they're coming out with a 3/5 o2i I get
it you know kind of like the anniversary
palette that's super fun super cute it
definitely you know of course looks very
similar to the original 35 oh I mean I
get it I was really wondering what the
price was gonna be on this I really was
because I actually saw some snaps from
Jaclyn hill
and she was a part of the process in
this I think she said that she developed
half of the eyeshadows that are in here
so I thought that was interesting I I
don't know for sure exactly what it is
Joplin's role within morphe you know she
created the dress until palette with
more for you but I was a little caught
off guard when I heard her say that you
know she really had a part in this new
morphe palette and it looked like when i
was watching her snaps i wasn't able to
watch all of them but from the the ones
that I caught it kind of looked like it
was new packaging kind of sleeker a
little bit you know like a step up from
the regular morphe packaging so
immediately my first thought was better
packaging and Jacqueline Hill had
something to do it that how much does
this palette can it be because the
Jacqueline Hill palette that recently
came out with more feet was I was at 35
$38 as compared to the regular 2299 and
for most of the 35 palettes from morphe
and I saw $23 I was like okay I'm not
bad I thought honestly I thought we were
gonna be in the 30s or closer to the 30s
I truly did so I think that's very
awesome
I'm completely attracted to it I did a
double-take I got excited when I saw the
price honestly I kind of first talked
myself out of this palette because I was
like I didn't see the price really at
first when we first saw about it and I
knew that Jacqueline was involved in it
I'm just thinking it's gonna be
expensive I'm trying to paint my office
like I'm trying to buy new furniture in
here like there's just no way so when I
saw $23 that's actually that gave me
another double take and I was like hmm
interesting $23 you say I feel like the
quality of the shadows are probably
going to be better than the 3/5 Oh I
purchased the three 5r which was the
palette that came out right before
Jacqueline Hills palette I'm pretty sure
and the quality of those eyeshadows were
already better I could tell from the 3
500 and the 350 that I previously owned
for more feet I could tell the 3/5 of
our shadows were much better
my Jaclyn hill eye shadows are the best
that I have tried for more feet those
are amazing shadows though it makes me
curious if this
5:02 will be on the same level of the
Jackson Hill pallet or if it'll be on
the same level it's a three five are
four it'll be somewhere in the middle as
long as it's not but below the three
five are then I think that's pretty
awesome even if it's somewhere in the
middle I think that's pretty darn good
if it's the same as the drug on Hill
you got yourself a freaking fantastic I
shadow palette I think I'm gonna freakin
do it okay okay okay I think I'm gonna
do it I talk to myself out of it and
then I talk to myself into it I was
really proud of myself and I'm like I'm
really gonna surprise people because you
know I talked about morphe a lot I own a
lot from morphe and I was like I'm gonna
surprise people in this will I buy a
video and be like I am not buying the
3502 and then and then I'm like yeah
actually I think I am again it goes back
to do you need something
no do you need more than like two
eyeshadow palettes probably not but it's
also makeup and it's what I enjoy
putting my money into I don't really buy
like clothes or shoes don't really go on
a lot of trips have an old car don't
care about my car that's what I want to
do I want to try this I want some of
these like hot shades I see what looks
to be like a hot red in there that hot
red and you guys know when I bought that
Nick's fire pellet I was going for that
hot red and I did not get it and I
returned that palette I want to see how
the formula compares to the other
shadows I want to see this kind of like
better packaging this you know step up
from morphe I want to see what that's
all about so with all of that and it's
only the $23 I don't think that's a bad
price if it was getting closer to the
30s I honestly think that I could have
continued to talk myself out of it but
seeing it was 23 I think I'm gonna do it
I'll put this on my list
we'll see how quickly it sells out
because there's a very good chance that
I won't be able to get it at least on
the first launch because a lot of times
the morphe brushes they're launches sell
out very quickly but I'm gonna at least
try I got this one on my list I'm on
this one I'm curious about it what do
you guys think guys have the 35 oh do
you want to try the 3 500 - what are
your thoughts let me know let's have
some discussions down below but I'm
pretty excited for it I'm kind of glad
that I talked myself into it not gonna
lie still moving on the next eyeshadow
palette that we're going to talk about
is a new palette from Anastasia Beverly
Hills oh yes she's come
the new eyeshadow palette is called
prism that has 14 different shades 7
ultra mats for dual chrome pigments 3
metallic pigments it's going to be
limited-edition that's going to be $42
will be available October 2nd on their
website October 3rd online at Sephora
Macy's uLTA Beauty Dillard's and
in-store October 15th so I will have any
of the links that I can find listed down
below so oh boy I'm coming out with a
new eyeshadow palette I mean I haven't
recovered from subcultura gate yet so
I'm just I'm just shook that they're
coming out with an eyeshadow palette
already like well are you guys ready
because I am definitely not ready so
there's that the shades in here they
look to be pretty interesting you know
we got got the different finishes with
the mattes the dual Chrome's the
metallic pigments $42 which that is the
standard price that's the modern
renaissance that was the subculture
that's really standard for how Nastasia
this one is a limited edition which
limited edition usually doesn't make me
quite as excited because it gets a
little bit harder down the road to use
and tutorials and things like that when
the palette is no longer available and
can't be purchased anywhere so I was a
little bit bummed when I saw a limited
edition I also can't tell I've heard
some people say this is forever Holiday
Collection and then some people said it
hasn't but if it's limited edition it
makes me think maybe it's part of
holiday so I almost and talked about it
in this video I was gonna wait for my
next holiday release its video which
will be coming soon and then I was like
you know what I don't know I can't
confirm I can't keep up there's so many
releases holiday non holiday
we're just gonna go ahead and edit in
here so we're gonna talk about it today
and hopefully nobody minds to be honest
I'm not getting it I'm not getting it
haven't recovered from self culture gate
I'm still shook I'm still getting
comments in about how dare I like the
subculture I had one of the weirdest
comments the other day I just really
want to tell this story because this is
how insane to me all of that subculture
craziness was I was wearing the look I
was wearing the eyeshadow palette in a
video and someone commented and said I
really like your eyeshadow today what
palette are you wearing and I said thank
you I'm wearing subculture they
responded back oh I thought I knew that
have licked Apache I'm like what you've
just complimented me on them but then
all of a sudden I say it's subculture
reverse changed your mind
no no no it's patchy it doesn't blend
well oh no no no I'm like okay that
doesn't actually make sense you know
that right like you know that and then
someone else come into some kind of
means I ended up deleting all of it
because I don't like when people attack
other subscribers or other commenters
that really bothers me I will delete
those being said I'm not interested in
this moment I liked the subculture
palette I still do I was wearing it
recently I feel like I was one of the
few that was able to make it work for me
and still somehow I don't know how I was
able to but I still liked it and I still
reach for it but that being said I do
feel like the marketing was pretty crap
on that and I feel you know I said it in
my review video if they would have been
a little bit more forthright on what
this palette was instead of telling us
that was the modern Renaissance this
sister and then having the formulation
be nothing like the monotron is bonds it
really kind of rubbed me the wrong way
so it just didn't make me even though I
liked the subculture it didn't make me
feel like new eyeshadow palette I'm
gonna go ahead and purchase that I'm
gonna wait this time I'm gonna wait it
out I'm gonna watch the reviews I'm
still a little bit salty that we were
kind of misled with the subculture
palette still a little salty over that
so I'm not ready I'm not ready yet to
open myself up for prison gate that
sounds weird Prison Prison Prison gate
I'll watch the review videos and if
everybody convinces me like I didn't get
the modern renaissance right away
everybody convinced me I needed that
palette I would not I bought it so you
know we'll see if it's one of those but
especially with it being a limited
edition I just don't feel the pole I
know a lot of people talk about how a
limited edition makes them want to buy
it more and I'm like the complete
opposite I see a limited edition I'm
like yeah I can do without it because
something permanent will come up that
will make me more excited so I've been
getting asked so many questions on the
prison palette I want to know what you
guys think about it are you guys ready
are you ready for a new anasazi Apella
are you still reeling from the
subculture did you like this look
Walter I don't know well let me know
your thoughts in the comments down below
I'd love to know but I'm gonna go ahead
and say no for the time being for prism
and then the final eyeshadow palette
we're gonna talk about I can finally
talk about because it's finally here or
it's about to be here I have been you
know I'm I am this palette like
something fierce but this one is the
Tarte tartlet toasted eyeshadow palette
say that five times fast oh okay so this
is going to be available on October 15th
on their website I don't have dates yet
that I'm seeing for Sephora and Ulta
just says October 15th on tarte that's
all i need to know i also didn't see a
price on the tarte instagram or the
trend mood instagram I'm assuming it's
probably going to be 46 dollars or
around 46 dollars because the shape of
the palette is similar to like the
tartlet and bloom and that was a $46 I
shadow palette a mix of a matte and
shimmer shades it's it's fall it's it's
fall perfection it's warm tones it's the
shades that I love so much and like I
said we've known about this palette for
quite some time and I have always had
this palette in the back of my head I've
always known I want this palette it
immediately called to me you know I
asked myself the couple of questions but
I was like no I still want it I still
want it I just I'm so excited about it I
really enjoyed the tartlet and bloom
eyeshadow palette it's definitely one of
my favorite eyeshadow palettes and I'm
very happy with that purchase so I feel
good about this one
I like the Tarte eyeshadows I have their
clay play palette I used that palette
all the time it's one of my favorites so
I'm super stoked about this tarts one of
my favorite brands I've been ready for
this palette I kind of had to think
about it a little bit as I was thinking
about filming this video because at
first I was only going to buy or you
know put on my list the toasted palette
and then I talked to myself into the
three 5:02 so I was like huh what do I
do
do I need both but I'm still gonna do it
because I've been so excited about the
Tarte toasted palette that I still want
it I've been excited I've been waiting
for it I know I've been asked to talk
about this one for so long but we didn't
have any like real information yet a
release date anything like
we didn't have anything yet and we
finally have the information so October
15th a lot of times I wait and I buy
items from Sephora or Ulta because I
prefer like their rewards programs and
things like that but Tarte actually has
a really good rewards program on their
website if you're not familiar with that
you just have to join the rewards
program it's free just like Sephora and
Ulta you get points you can redeem them
you get extra samples you get extra
little bonus gifts from the Tarte
website so I totally have no problems
ordering from the Tarte website that's
why I ordered the clay play palette from
because I was really excited for that
it's where I'm gonna be ordering the
Tarte toasted palette hopefully it
doesn't sell out on the first day I mean
even still I will I will hop on there on
October 15th I don't have a specific
time it looks so beautiful these golds
and oranges mmm I wish there was like
that hot red in there but that's why I
have to buy the through 502 you know I'm
really excited for it I love the
packaging of it and like I said I feel
like tarah has really quality eyeshadow
palettes so if you can't tell I'm super
stoked I'm probably the most excited
this week I definitely am most excited
