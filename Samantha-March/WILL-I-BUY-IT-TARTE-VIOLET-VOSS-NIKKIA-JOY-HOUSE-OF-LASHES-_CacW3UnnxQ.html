today's video is going to be a new
lullaby it video I post my will I buy it
every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about some new makeup releases
and lunches letting you know a little
bit about them and then also chatting
about if I'm going to pick them up or
pass over them as always I have a lot to
talk about this week so why don't we go
ahead and get started I got quite a few
tags on these new releases with house of
lashes ex Sephora collection so I'm
reading from the trend would one
Instagram site will have her Instagram
linked down in my description box as
well but the Sephora collection and
house of lashes says inspired from a
Parisian landmarks and includes a two
palace the Secret Garden palette which
is $45 a mix of sixteen warm tones
mattes petals and metallic shades and
then also Versailles which is also $45
mix of sixteen cool toned mattes pearls
and metallics there are also some lashes
in there the Juliet lashes which are $14
and the camille lashes which are $14
there's also the art and Wavell for $28
which is liquid liners and then creme de
la creme for $28 it says three bold
metallic liner shades that will
highlight and accentuate the look says
it will all be available around December
11th so it should already be available
so I will have some links down below it
definitely was intrigued right away
especially when I saw the lashes because
I love lashes so much and I love trying
out new lashes I feel like that's kind
of what my eyes went to first and I know
House of lashes is in my opinion most
well-known for their lashes which would
make sense based off their name I have
only tried one style myself though I
actually got it as a birthday gift from
my mom I think it was two years ago she
sent me the heartbreaker lashes and I
liked him like I had asked my mom for
them specifically and I thought they
were okay they weren't my favorite
lashes I wore them until they
disintegrated on me but they weren't
like my absolute favorite and I haven't
purchased again from House of lashes I
have other lashes that I would like to
try but I kind of haven't because they
didn't like super blow me away or
anything so I kind of looked at the
lashes first $14 for lashes that's the
same price as pur cosmetics lashes which
are some of my favorites
$14 to me is kind of like middle of the
road it's not like drugstore prices but
it's not like the $20
who'da lashes or like I have a blinking
Beauty on today which are $25 I believe
so
in the middle there at 14 and then I'm
going to pass over the lashes zone I
think out of the collection the thing
that I would be most interested in would
be the lashes I'm gonna pass over them I
actually have more lashes to talk about
this bill about video which is kind of
wild but I have my eyes right now on a
bold face makeup and their lashes I
actually just went through just last
night and added some styles to my cart
and was looking at all the different
ones and I'm planning on making that
purchase really soon so I'm gonna go
ahead and pass over them because I think
I picked out like three from there I
just got more pure lashes and another
pair of blinking Beauty lashes so I'm
gonna skip over those the eye shadow
palette I'm I am so overwhelmed with
eyeshadow palettes right now and I know
it's like a really sad problem to have
but I have bought a lot of eyeshadow
palettes recently I bought 10 i buy two
or three during my Black Friday haul
that video is live I will post that down
below I've also gotten a lot in PR
recently but I really like it like when
I'm doing my reviews I really want to
try each palette or lipstick or
foundation of whatever it is that I'm
reviewing and try them like 5 to 10
times before I come on and give a review
but that means I have to try them and
wear them a lot and when I have so many
different palettes I'm like how do I get
the time to review and try all of these
you know to prep for my review video so
I'm just kind of overwhelmed and they
weren't something that caught my
attention like I was like oh I
absolutely need to have that though it
just didn't catch my attention right
away and both looking at the pictures
like the actual palette is super cute
you know $45 that's on the higher price
point for me personally and I just I
need to be trying what I have in my
collection right now so I can review so
that's why I'm gonna pass over that I
know a lot of you are feeling the same
way like you are so overwhelmed with new
releases there's so much out there and
then Black Friday you know we were all
buying everything in all of the comments
and so many of you guys are saying the
exact same things like we are just super
overwhelmed and then the other releases
like the liners and things like that
that's just not something that's super
interest me I have like my favorite
go-to liners that I repurchase and that
I have a lot in my collection so
something like that really never catches
my attention I'm not gonna get anything
from this collection I thought it was
super cute but it's just not gonna be
for me at this time but let me know what
you guys think because I got quite a few
tags on this one actually I meant to put
it in last week's video and then there
was just
much going on so I still wanted to
include it in a video because I've
gotten so many tags so let us know what
you picked up or what you're planning on
picking up or you know really whatever
it is that you love from house of lashes
that you would recommend do you have a
favorite style of lash that you would
recommend leave some comments so like I
think I got more tags on lashes I was
getting so many questions especially
YouTube comments specifically about
Nakia joy and her lash collection that
just recently launched Nikki oh joy is a
youtuber I think she is a professional
makeup artist as well and it looks like
she recently just came out with a whole
bunch of lashes I'm looking at Nikki oh
joy cosmetics calm there is several
different lashes there's a classic
collection of faux mink collection
there's lash sets that you can buy the
silk collection says that's coming soon
looks like they range from six dollars I
think the highest I saw was twelve
dollars for single pair of lashes and
then there are also says for like thirty
thirty-five dollars and there are a ton
of different lashes in here they're not
super familiar with Nakia joy myself but
I think that's freaking amazing what
she's done to create own lash line
that's like I should take major goals
with my cuz I love lashes so much I
think that's really amazing so
definitely you know the website will be
listed down below I can also listen her
Instagram to let me know if you guys
love Nikki a joy if you've been a huge
supporter of her and you were so excited
to see these lashes I think it's super
cool and I love supporting girl bosses
and entrepreneurs I think that is so
amazing but like I said I am about to
place an order with the bold-faced
lashes and I have I'm pretty sure it's
three lashes if not four lash is already
in my cart and then I just bought like
two or three other lash sets recently so
I don't I don't like need any at this
time and I wear my lashes a ton I clean
my lashes I take care of my lashes I
mean I'm not kidding when I say I wear
lashes up to like 30 times 40 times I'm
not that's like that's not a joke I wear
my lashes until I cannot wear them
anymore and they fall apart at my
fingertips that's when I throw them away
but I love lashes and I wear them so
often but there also comes a point where
I don't need to buy anymore because my
last drawer is so full and that's kind
of
I am right now I really do want to
purchase fom up the boldface I mentioned
them in the aprons I want to try in 2018
and I know one of my YouTube friends
just got 8 just come close there and I
was like perfect I'm so glad I waited
because now I can you know support
another influencer know collaborate and
I Cutler she just mentioned on her
snapchat and I was like yes I knew there
was a reason I was waiting to get these
lashes let's close for you to get a
discount code because I love being able
to support friends and that kind of way
so I'm planning on making that purchase
but I definitely am going to be keeping
my radar on the Nakia joy lashes I would
love to know if anybody has purchased
from them what you think about them I am
actually pretty particular about my
lashes just because I wear them so much
and I wear them all day like I just
really need comfortable lashes lashes
that are easy to work with a lot of
times I'm doing my makeup in a hurry so
I can film before the Sun Goes Down new
lashes that are easy to pop on I can't
be messing with them a lot so I am
actually pretty particular about them so
if anybody has any feedback yet I would
love to hear it in the comment section
but yeah I'll definitely be watching for
this one and when it comes time to kind
of replenish my last collection I will
definitely have Nicki oh joy lashes at
the top of my list because I would
really like to be able to try them out
but thank you so much for all the tags
because like I said I wasn't a follower
before this and I didn't know about them
thank you guys so much for the tags that
really does help out now I hit the wilai
bias but just me in general and you know
getting to know more people out there
you know there's so many people out
there it's impossible to follow and know
everybody especially when you just
started watching YouTube right before
you started a channel so there's that
but yes thank you so much for all the
tags and yeah I'd love to know any of
your thoughts about these and the key of
joy lashes in the comments as well so
next time we have a new eyeshadow
palette from viola boss over I D here we
go
this is called the hashtag palette and
it's supposed to be coming in
mid-december I don't see a price on it
yet but I'm assuming it's gonna be $45
because it looks similar and like
packaging shade number of shades to the
Holy Grail palette and other by the boss
pallets which are $45 so when I saw this
I did a double take I'm not gonna lie I
did it'll tank and I was like no why now
like why are you releasing eyeshadow
palette that I want now and I have so
many and I'm trying so hard to stay
strong and not buy a ton of
i shadow pellets because just what was
it like a month or two ago or something
they released the top-notch eyeshadow
palette featured it in a will I buy a
video and I was like it's too
monochromatic for me just look like all
of the same type of color so I was like
nope I'm passing over it and I wish
these would have been flip-flopped
because I could have purchased an
eyeshadow palette at that time but now
I'm like over here trying my hardest to
stay strong but they're releasing the
eyeshadow pail out that I went mmm what
it looks really cool from the photo
which I will say it's not like the best
quality of photo that I'm looking at but
it looks like there's some cool yellows
in there the entire bottom row is
purples which I love Purple's some of my
favorite looks to wear it because I
think purple pairs with green eyes
really well like I'm interested in it
how am I gonna talk myself out of this
y'all got to help me out this one
because I'm not sure I'm strong enough
to say no and just turn my back to it
what that being said the 45 dollars you
know it is a little bit more pricey but
compared to this one to the house of
lashes I do have the holy grail palette
from violet vos and it truly is one of
my favorite eyeshadow palettes I reach
for it so much and I just I do enjoy it
and I've been wanting to try another
violet boss eyes shadow palette but I
was kind of waiting for that one that
would really spark my attention to come
out some of the past releases didn't
catch my intention enough besides like
the was like oh like the writer died but
that was like a huge palette for $75 and
I'm like good together girl you don't
need it so I've kind of been waiting for
that one to come out and then when taupe
notch came out I was like nope can't do
it but now this one I'm like yeah yeah
I'm really interested in this one so
violet boss is recently at Sephora which
is really exciting and I actually went
to purchase the holy girl I shadow
palette the other day for a giveaway and
it was sold out so hopefully that means
about the boss is doing well it's aura I
don't know but I hope that hashtag comes
in to Sephora because if it does I think
I will purchase it there you know the
holidays are coming up I typically
always get at least one gift card to
Sephora so maybe I won't feel quite as
bad at purchasing but I love that more
brands are coming into like Sephora and
Ulta I just really enjoy purchasing from
them I enjoy the cash back at eBay I
enjoyed the rewards points and programs
I enjoy getting gift cards you know to
these stores where I can purchase from
so many different brands I think it's
they awesome so I'm pretty sure if this
one does come into Sephora I will
probably buy it I don't think it's gonna
be something I purchased on the release
day because I think that will probably
be fairly soon but I think I would still
purchase like fairly shortly afterwards
because it's something that has caught
my attention I would love to know every
comments down below of course you know
maybe you guys can talk me out of it but
I've just been waiting and waiting for
that by that boss eyes shadow palette to
catch my attention to make me want it
and now hashtag is here and it's doing
that for me so I'm like how do I say no
but I really am going to try to you know
get through some of these eyeshadow
palettes that I have recently get my
review videos up and then it'll be like
a reward you know like treat yourself
girl
you deserve that eyeshadow palette you
know does that make sense
is that how we justify things those are
my thoughts on the hash tag palette from
a viola Foss and I would love to know
yours in the comments all right so this
next one alright didn't see coming and
someone had actually posted a youtube
comment a couple days ago on a video and
they said did you see that part is
coming out with a new clay play two
eyeshadow palette and I was like and
yeah yeah it's true it's true I just saw
this on trend mood I actually have it
like I had my list ready to go like I
always do when I film these videos on
Tuesday of course just like an hour
before I go to sit down I see those
tanks are coming in on Instagram so I'm
like oh my gosh it's coming out the clay
play who I shadow palette and I'm like
is $46 just like the original clay play
which I have and I love it's one of my
favorite palettes I reach for it so
often it has a shadow that has contours
in there for me and as bronzers in there
for me I can't believe they're coming
out with a clay blade to like but I feel
like this is almost like me live getting
the news almost in a way because it
literally just happened and I'm still
trying to figure it out but I'm like
whoa who saw is coming who saw this
coming I did it and I followed Tarte on
like every single platform I watched the
YouTube videos and everything I'm like
how did I not see this I clearly missed
the mark somewhere this one looks
interesting because it does include a
blush bronze
and highlight in addition to the
eyeshadow shades so of course I'll have
the best photo that I can find elicit
down below but I'm like yeah tart just
take it take just take it take my money
what are they doing to me
why trying to be strong failing
miserably
I love the clay play and it's
interesting to me because I actually
purchased the park F princess like
chisel palette I think is what it was
called and I ended up returning it it
was 46 dollars which is pricey but I
ended up returning it because I was like
the clip plays better and the chisel
palette was like setting powders contour
bronzer shades and I'm like I really
have the majority of this in the clay
play and the clay play was better
quality so I'm like what so I did end up
for returning it and now I'm like oh
great I returned it so I can buy clay
and play too because what how to say no
it has a blush in there which is awesome
because the original clay play does not
and also as a highlight in there which
again the clay play one does not have
and it looks like it has a different eye
shadow shades but yeah I'm pumped I feel
like I need this I believe it's actually
available I'm looking at the Sephora app
I am a Rouge so sometimes I I can see
things before other people do because
you know they try to make us feel
special in these little ways but I don't
know it doesn't say it doesn't it
doesn't marked with Rouge or anything so
it must just be available right now but
wow I was not ready for this
I wasn't expecting this but I'm very
excited because I love that clay play I
think that the clay play to made me do a
double-take just as hard and I feel like
I'm gonna get really good quality with
this one and just knowing how often I
reach for the clay play one I feel like
I would reach for the clay play too just
as much for that blush and highlight
shade and also some of the different uh
eyeshadow shades in there as well so
yeah you know I mean I feel like I'm not
shocking anybody by saying that I will
be buying this one I'm super super
excited about it I think that's really
cool and I think that this would be a
better purchase for me to then the park
after incest which like I said I did
under returning but I feel like this one
makes more sense like if this would it
came out first I would have bought this
one like I kind of don't even really
understand now white art did the chisel
palette I don't know
especially because they weren't even
like the shades weren't all that
different than the clinic lay like I
could understand if it was maybe meant
for different like a different skin tone
category but it was really just so
similar to the clay play it was kind of
silly so I'm like why even release that
you should have just came out of clinic
play too so yeah I am planning on
purchasing this one so I did a terrible
job at staying strong in this video but
I've a couple of ER and I can't help it
if this why when things don't excite me
I can more easily talk myself out of
them because then products like the
violet boss hashtag palette and tart
click like to come around and I'm just
like over here like seal clapping away
because I'm so excited
so hopefully that makes sense because I
know there's really at videos where I
say I'm not gonna buy anything and
people are like you're not a true makeup
lover you're not buying anything no it's
because when items come out and they
really excite me that's what I should be
putting my money towards not things that
I think are mediocre not things that I
just want to review for a YouTube
channel things that actually really
excite me like you just saw in this
video so it's hard you did it again I
guess I just everything for this week so
will I buy a video I really hope you
enjoyed this week's video or found it
helpful or entertaining in some way as
always let me know what you thought
about all the products as that I
mentioned in the comments what are you

this video so let me know in the
comments down below and of course let me
know what you want to see in next week
