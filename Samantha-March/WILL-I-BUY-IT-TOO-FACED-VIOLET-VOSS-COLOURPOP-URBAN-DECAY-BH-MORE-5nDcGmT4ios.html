today's video is going to be my weekly
will I buy it I post my male update
videos every single Wednesday where I'm
chatting about some new makeup releases
and lunches talking a little bit about
them letting you know my thoughts on
them and if I'm planning to pick them up
or pass over them and as always I'd like
to chat about this week so why don't we
go ahead and get started but I was
getting some tags on new releases are
from nabla cosmetics I talked about
nabla cosmetics just a couple weeks ago
about their new eyeshadow palette that
was coming out I think it was called the
soul blooming palette it was that one
and now they have some more new releases
coming up so they have a concealer
coming out of baking and setting powder
a powder brush a concealer brush a
makeup sponge and then also a makeup bag
it's gonna be coming out on June 7th so
I've never purchased anything from nabla
cosmetics I ended up not getting that
eye shadow palette I was just kind of
reading you know I love obviously
reading the comments in the feedback
that comes that comes in on these videos
and a lot of people seem to kind of be
trying to talk me out of that palette so
I decided that I would wait and see and
just watch the reviews and see what
everyone else has to say about that
palette so I've still never made a
purchase from nabla cosmetics I can't
say it like for the concealer it's just
something I'm not super interested in I
just picked up the new uLTA Beauty
concealer that I shared in my latest
haul and I'm really actually liking it
the baking and setting powder I have so
many of those i Jesta declutter for that
I just wouldn't need it the brushes
again just stood a brush to clutter
trying to rein it in on how many brushes
I purchased I mean I do like sponges
don't get me wrong like I love trying
out new makeup sponges I don't know what
that's about but it's fun but a lot of
these things and then like the makeup
bag it's like do I really need anything
right now
probably not sometimes in Mobilia bite
videos if I've just made like a big
makeup purchase which I did there's a
lot of sales over Memorial Day weekend
there was double cashback at Sephora
through Ebates also was having some
coupons so that's when I went ahead and
place my orders and I feel like I got
quite a bit of stuff I did just share my
haul video so I'll have it linked down
below but I feel like when that happens
I kind of like think a little bit harder
you know it's like Who am I just
money on makeup and there's a lot of
things that I want to be trying and and
all of that so I'm not gonna pick up
anything from these new releases from
nabla cosmetics but I would love to know
if you are okay obviously it's not a
will i buy it video unless we're gonna
talk about color pop because color pop
has some more new releases coming out so
color pop is celebrating their birthday
I remember I even said it last week or I
put the year that they start it over
here and now I've already forgotten it
but I want to say maybe they've been
around for like four years or something
which is crazy to see how successful a
company has gotten and such a small
amount of time like that was pretty wild
when you think about it but they are
coming out with some more new releases
and honestly these ones kind of got my
attention color pop is one of those
brands that they just put out so much
that a lot of times it can get
overwhelming and it kind of like deters
me from buying from them because I'm
like it's just too much like I know stop
but every once in a while they do
release something that does cause me to
give them the side I'm so this is their
new face duos it says each one includes
a sculpting shade and a highlighter they
are ten dollars and it looks like they
have three different ones one is cool
tone for light skin tones one is warm
tone for medium and warm tone for medium
deep so I'm interested in these because
I feel like I've always heard a lot of
really good things about the color pop
based duo's and they've always been on
my list who buy from colour-pop there
was one time I was placing an order I
don't remember what it was for but the
particular face duo that I want it which
I couldn't even tell you the name of it
right now it was sold out and I think
there was another time - that's gonna
place an order and I wanted that face
duo and it was sold out again a lot of
people just seemed to say really good
things about them I see them pop up in
tutorials quite often so I've always
kind of liked can been been considering
it so when I saw that they were coming
up these new ones I get a little nervous
though when I do see like new things
like this because color pop is pretty
notorious for constantly changing
formulas I mean with their face products
with their eyes shadow is with their
lipsticks when I first started getting
into color pop I was purchasing their
lip products quite a bit like
especially like their altar mats and it
felt like every three months you were
getting a completely different formula
and it's like it's frustrating because
you feel like you don't know what you're
ordering and it's frustrating as a
blogger who tries to get reviews it's
frustrating because you don't know when
something is changing and it's changing
for the worse and it's like oh I've been
recommending that recommending that and
people are buying it and being like what
is terrible or you know it's it's not
exactly like what you said it was gonna
be like you know so it's kind of
difficult but I think I still want to
pick one of these up and maybe would do
house of mirrors which is the warm tone
medium I you know typically in the
summertime I do get quite a bit tanner
and just kind of looking at the
highlighted in this photo I think I
would like that highlight a lot on me so
I'm thinking about this one this is the
one that I'm uh I'm considering of
course I was getting a whole bunch of
tags on a new palette from Too Faced
it's always so interesting to see I get
tagged a lot over on my Instagram so if
you're not following me on Instagram a
lot of people tagged me directly on
trend mood when she posts new photos and
I always have her page listed down below
oftentimes I'm just reading directly
from her account but sometimes it's so
funny to see people's opinions or the
emojis that they use when they tagged me
because it always helps me get a vibe of
what people are thinking
but Too Faced so it says two-face is
taking us back to 1998 so I have a new
eyeshadow palette coming out it says
it's gonna have different finishes all I
see on this post right now is that it's
coming soon and I don't think I see
anything else about it but I think Too
Faced is kind of celebrating their
twenty years is that right
Methos art so who knows it could be away
from but they are celebrating their
their launch you know anniversary and
whatnot so they're doing kind of a lot
of like throwback stuff which is which
is super cute I get that I dig that
so the inside of the palette you know we
can see everything and it looks it's
very interesting like there's the top
row the bottom row and the top row says
circa 1998 the bottom row says circa
2008
and then we have the original ten and
then the originals reinvented I think
the concept is really cool you guys
don't know I'm a big fan of like
nostalgia I mean if you watch
yesterday's video about the brands that
I loved before PR and I was sharing all
my different little stories I love stuff
like that so when I saw this I was like
I really really liked the concept of
this because it's just like it's just
something fun for me and also if you
guys don't know I've said it before in
like a few previous videos but to face
was one of the first you know high-end
brands that I was purchasing a lot from
and I actually started out as a blogger
almost 10 years ago and I have a blog
still I review book sonic I'm also an
author and a book blogger
but I also reviewed a lot of lifestyle
things on there and also makeup and
beauty &amp;amp; 2face was one of the first ever
makeup brands that sent me PR before I
had a youtube channel before Instagram
and all of that and I would review the
products on my blog for Too Faced so
it's always like I don't know so just
when I saw this it just kind of like
brought me back to like how I could
remember feeling getting the packages
from Too Faced I see this I kind of like
get those memories as well like can you
believe that that was a thing like that
that was something that used to happen
even before you know YouTube and you
know videos and Instagram and all that
kind of took over it was good old
blogging so all of that aside though I
don't know if the palette gives me the
feels that I want it to give me again I
like the concept I really do and I don't
it just I don't know something about the
inside still isn't calling enough to me
I don't know what it is like but I'm I
kind of wish I felt differently because
I feel like this would be a palette that
would be up my alley just thinking about
everything else that I just said but
still when I saw when I saw what it
looked like on the inside I was just
kind of like me so I don't know I you
know I don't see a price on it either
maybe maybe something will change my
mind or maybe something will sway me you
know I like some of the
the Pink's in there and the purple and
again I truly do like the concept of it
but just looking at the inside I'm not
sure if it's gonna totally you know call
to me and that way but again I'll be
watching for it I'll be watching for the
price of it and maybe seeing you know if
I see some other reviews coming in for
it I'll see what people have to say cuz
concept like rely what do you guys think
about though cuz a lot of people it
seemed like a lot of people weren't
really feeling it so you'll have to let
me know what you think moving on so BH
Cosmetics has another new release so
this one is called the roar of lights so
it's a new addition to their galaxy
pallets and it's the baked eyeshadow
formula so they are coming out with a
couple different things on the palette
which is gonna be is it $18 and then
there's gonna be a 10 piece brush set as
well the brushes I'd probably pass over
I still want to get the marble brushes
that BH just released I haven't gotten
yep and I'm still highly considering it
I wanted to do my brush to clutter first
which I did so one thing that I'll say
like the insight it looks cool you know
it looks very like galaxy and funky and
all of that I actually don't love the BH
baked eyeshadow formula though and I
think a lot of people really do I've
heard good things about it and that's
why I've tried the palettes in the past
that have that baked eyeshadow formula
but it's just not a favorite for me I
felt like it was just kind of hard to
get the product on my brush I feel like
it was hard to get the product on my
eyes so that for that reason I would
know that I would skip over this one
because it's just it's not a formula
that I love I would prefer like their
regular eye shadows that's what I enjoy
the most but if you are someone who does
love the baked eyeshadow formula you
could probably really like this one and
the colors are really fun and funky and
you know there's some pop Pink's in
there and of course we got the blues and
the golds and all of that I mean it
looks like a really pretty green and of
course $18 I mean that's pretty cool so
it says that there's glitter finishes
foil finishes and high-impact color
finishes so pretty neat I'm just not
going to be one for me but to let me
know what you think this one I thought
was pretty interesting we have
new brand launching which I was curious
about so it says Revlon is launching a
new exclusive prestige brand called
flesh Beauty and they are starting off
with a forty shades of foundation sticks
also 14 highlighters eight blushes 13
lipsticks and eyeshadow palettes okay so
the price range looks to be around $18
for the lipsticks $38 for the eyeshadow
palettes it says will be available at
June 24th online at Ulta beauty
exclusive and in 575 doors by the end of
2018 okay so obviously I think this is
getting a lot of buzz because it's a new
brand coming out with the 40 shades a
foundation I think a lot of people are
really you know seeing that and being
excited for that one thing that I
thought was interesting when I saw
Revlon is launching a new brand but then
it says prestige brand and then you know
we're seeing 38 for the eyeshadows and
18 for the lipsticks I don't think it
says 38 for the eyeshadow palette 18 for
the lipsticks I think I've said that
incorrectly I don't see a price on what
maybe the foundations will run but I
thought that was interesting because
Revlon is to me was more known for being
an affordable brand so Revlon is kind of
like their own big umbrella and then
they own other brands underneath it
similar to like an sa Lauder is like the
umbrella and then they own brands
underneath including Too Faced so Revlon
I looked it up because I was like hmm
and Revlon owns Revlon obviously also
all May which is a more affordable brand
also sinful colors which I didn't
realize that is more of like an
affordable nail polish brand but then
they also owned Elizabeth Arden which i
think is a little bit more up there I'm
not super familiar with that brand but
it was just something that kind of
caught my attention like okay so breath
under Revlon Sunbrella they're coming
out the new prestige brand that's
interesting flesh beauty they say kind
of the quote from it is it's really
focused on the idea of flesh being all
flesh colors we're redefining the notion
of what flesh color really is and having
it to be inclusive on every level I'm
definitely pretty curious about this one
and since it will be an Ulta Beauty
that's pretty cool as well apparently is
gonna be more in the prestige side but I
don't
I'll definitely be interested in in what
everything is going to be about so far I
only see photos of the foundation I
don't see that eyeshadow pellet that's
been released yet I don't see the
lipstick shades or anything like that so
we don't have a ton to go off of yet at
this moment but I'm curious about this
that's pretty interesting is that we got
a new brand new brand on the horizon so
next time I have a new release year from
a beauty a bakery makeup they're coming
out with the milk and honey highlighter
palette so as it'll be available on June
15th I thinking you just get Beauty
bakery on their website I didn't see a
price on this palette so I'm not going
to present on what the price will be
this is one like I kind of looked at it
for a while like do I need this one it
definitely kind of gives me like glow
kit vibes you know we got the four
different pans in there I like the the
base sweet the be sweet Bay hello one it
kind of has like the imprint it says
like milk and honey and suction there so
that's pretty cute
I do wish we had a price on it but if
I'm thinking realistically realistically
in my latest haul I purchased the laura
geller gilded honey highlight and I also
purchased the natasha to known a duo
which I do have on my face today both
the blush and the highlight which I
think are pretty darn pretty pretty darn
pretty I'm so I'm like realistically do
I need another highlight palette
probably not so I think I'm gonna be
good and say no to this one but it does
look really pretty but then next ya know
I'm not gonna be so strong here okay so
violet boss is coming out with the new
eyeshadow palette and the moment that I
saw this photo like the tanks were
coming in I didn't know that this was a
violent boss palette looking at the
release photo that they shared I
wouldn't have guessed violet boss it
just looked different from their other
palettes that we've seen so this is or
doesn't even have a name on it I don't
even know if it has a name it just says
coming soon on that post and that is
yeah that's the only post I see so far
about it okay so we don't have much
information about it but I'm into it I'm
into it because when I first saw it it
reminded me of the Natasha jinan tropic
palette
I really wanted that one but that's you
know over $100 for Natasha Genoa and I
was like hmm I just don't know if I can
do it violet Voss pellets are usually
around four dollars am I saying that
right yes most of their pellets I
checked around like 45 dollars so
hopefully that's what this one would be
because I am interested in it it's so
pretty it looks really beautiful for
summer I'm an entrance and what am i
smelling I'm too excited I can't speak
I'm interested in those yellows and the
oranges the Pink's look beautiful that
light blue looks really nice as well I'm
interested in it I'm probably gonna go
ahead and pick this one up I have the
Holy Grail a shadow from violet box is
one of my Holy Grails I love that
palette I wear it so often and then I
also have the hashtag palette from them
as well which I don't love as much as
the Holy Grail but I like this color
scheme and for how like I really did
want that Natasha general topic palette
but I just could not like I haven't been
able to purchase a Natasha palette
because I'm like it's just so fun stuff
but I'm really attracted to those colors
in there I think look like I think it
looks like a really nice summer palette
so I'm probably gonna pick that one up
but I love box you can also usually
their palettes are coming in to Sephora
now as well so especially if it would be
available at Sephora want that one want
that one real bad okay and then the last
item that I have to chat about this week
is another new eyeshadow palette this
one is from Urban Decay they really are
coming out with a lot lately so their
new palette is called Born to Run and
it's travel inspired which is also right
up my alley
it says includes 21 shades with
different finishes it's gonna be $49 and
it will be available in July the
packaging on it is really really cute
and me and like travel inspired if you
guys don't know I was a travel major in
college uh I feel like the in spell
behind this palette and like I love the
names in there as well oh but okay so
$49 I really do like Urban Decay they're
one of my favorite brands I like a lot
of their eyeshadow palettes but I don't
I don't know like something about
when I saw something about when I saw
this one I didn't immediately like get
the vibe like I got the vibe from the
packaging I was like boo what's it gonna
be and then when I saw the inside I was
like ah I like I feel like I'm trying to
get myself excited for it which I've so
loved about what do you guys think what
what do you guys think about this one I
don't know why it's just it's not
speaking to me as much as I thought
maybe it would and I feel like at first
glance when I look at this I just
immediately think oh I have those I mean
you know and we can say that so often
about so many different makeup releases
but still there are certain things about
whatever makeup item it might be that
you're like I know I have those shades
but I still have this one I'm so excited
about it and then there's other products
that you're like I know I have those
shades so I can say no and that's kind
of where I'm at with this one oh but I
love I love the packaging on it so much
I really do and it's $49 I I like a lot
of the Urban Decay eyeshadow palettes
and I think they are really good quality
so I'm kind of going back and forth
between this one what do you guys think
about it what do you guys think let me
know in the comments down below
this one I'm kind of teetering back and
forth on but I feel like I should say no
