today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it so I share a will i buy it
video every single Wednesday so you can
check back in typically in the mornings
on Wednesday and I will have a new will
I buy it
these videos just go through makeup
products and I discuss if I'm gonna buy
it or if I'm not gonna buy it so I
started doing at these videos actually
back in the summer I thought I didn't
think it was that long ago but I
recently looked and it was back in the
summer that I started these videos and I
served them as a way to still be able to
talk about makeup products like newer
theses or hyped up makeup or makeup this
coming back in stock at cetera without
feeling like I need to purchase
everything because I can't do that I
don't get the PR packages so I created
this series as a way to still be able to
talk about these products and give my
thoughts and feedback on them and also
just kind of talk to you guys as a
regular person because that's always
what I just trust that I am I do have a
beauty YouTube channel but I am just a
regular girl living in Iowa who writes
books for a living so I thought it would
be a fun way to discuss as a real person
what it is that I look for when I'm
making my makeup purchases because new
makeup is coming out all of the time new
brands are popping up all the time and
it can be really overwhelming so I just
thought it would be a fun way to show
how I make my purchases and how I decide
what I want to get so as always I'm
excited for these videos these are some
of my favorite to film that's why I turn
it into a weekly series but if you'd
like to see the latest products that I'm
considering if I will buy it or not
please keep watching ok so the first
products that I want to talk about it's
actually something that I've talked
about in a previous will i buy it video
but it was before there was a lot known
about the product and now this product
has released and people are asking me a
lot of questions about it so what I'm
talking about is the collaboration with
Too Faced and Kat Von D Beauty they
collab together and came out with a
limited edition collection so like I
said I made this I featured this and I
will I buy it back when it was first
announced and kind of the first looks
for coming out we didn't have her would
be state yet we didn't have prices yet
or anything like that but I still talked
about it in my will I buy a video now
that I'm making these every single week
I won't like feel the need to to talk
about things so far into the future but
that was before I was you know
making them once a month ourselves so I
thought I would touch on it again
briefly just because I've had a lot of
questions come in I can leave that video
linked down below I have a whole will I
buy a playlist as well that will be
linked down below but if you're curious
of my initial thoughts on the collection
you can see them in that video and it's
interesting now because now that the
collection is here to see what I think
about it so first of all what the
collection includes there is the Too
Faced and Kat Von D butter together
ultimate eye collection it is $65 and I
will leave pictures in here throughout
of what the collection looks like so it
says Kat I'm reading off the Kat Von D
Beauty website it says captain and her
BFF Geri co-founder of to face each
created six gorgeous new eyeshadows for
their respective sides of the palette
you can see the palette is like split in
half at the hearts 1/2 very cute very
cute packaging this is inspired by a
best friend's heart necklace the palette
has a magnetic center panel so you can
break apart the two halves you can
create a look using just one side of the
palette or mix-and-match shades from
both the 12 total shades feature Kat Von
D and toothpaste signature pigment rich
eyes shadow formulation in matte shimmer
and metallic finishes and if that
weren't enough the set also includes the
one and only tattoo liner in trooper
black excellent eye liner and then layer
on some drama with Too Faced mind
blowing of better than sex mascara great
mascara I believe the liner and the
mascara are both more like deluxe
samples so the aya collection $65 you
get the heart palette that each has the
six eyeshadows from 6mm two-phase system
Kat Von D the eyeliner mascara $65 as of
right now the entire collection is
available on Kat Von D Beauty calm to
face calm and Sephora calm and I saw
that it is coming into Sephora stores on
1226 I'll leave everything linked down
below if I find any other information or
any other places where it's available it
will be in the description box below as
well but that is what I see so far so
the eye collection I really honestly
have thought about purchasing this
collection I really like have on DVD and
I really do like two-faced since then
since my prior video I've become a
little salty with Too Faced over the
white chocolate chip pile
debacle I will leave my videos on the
white chocolate chip palette link down
below I really I'm just still I'm still
a little salty over everything so I
don't know that's definitely kind of
impacted my two-faced purchases I didn't
purchase tea I didn't purchase anything
from the peach collection which I did oh
well I buy it on the entire page
collection and I said I still honestly
I'm salty over the white chocolate chip
palette the whole chocolate chip
palettes that release just gave me the
feels in a bad way so there's that also
this is limited edition and I talk about
it a lot in my will I bite videos that I
try not to purchase a ton of limited
edition because it's harder to use in
the future and as someone who doesn't
make money as a youtuber does it make
money as a beauty blogger doesn't get
the PR packages in the free makeup I
need to be very careful what it is I'm
buying what it is I'm spending my money
on you know trying not to overspend on
makeup but then especially to just
continually pad my makeup collection
with limited edition items that are
harder to use an upcoming makeup
tutorials it's just not very smart and
that's why I don't do it so you know I
always make sure to say do I never buy a
limited edition no of course I'm going
to buy some limited edition but I just
try to be thoughtful of what it is that
I'm buying so I don't know for those
reasons and it's $65 which is more
expensive I know that you're getting
eyeshadow palette and the two little
deluxe minis which is great but I don't
know it's just a little pricey to me and
I'm just not feeling it anymore I was I
was actually kind of feeling it back
when it first came out I thought it
would be fun but since then my feelings
have definitely changed so I'm actually
gonna pass over the eye collection what
do you guys think
are you guys gonna get it or have you
already gotten it it has already
released at the time that I'm filming
this video but I just I decided I'm
gonna pass on I don't need to spend the
$65 on that but there are also a few
other things in the collection so you
can get the Too Faced and Kat Von D
butter together
cheek and a lip makeup bag set and that
is $38 this one says a super limited
collection I mean it's just like it's so
annoying like I don't know I mean that's
a whole another ball game but like it
just is super annoying to me she can let
makeup bag stars cats beloved kitty P
off high off I do not know how to say
that name
but I do not know how you pronounce that
and to face co-founder Jared sweet
Chihuahua clover on a heart-shaped pouch
it's packed with four darling Mondays
for your cheeks and lips including two
new exclusive shades so you get two new
shades for your Kat Von D lipstick
collection the set includes a mini
everlasting liquid lipstick in matte
oxblood XL and in mini studded kiss
lipstick in Muse which is a shimmering
nude and then treat you cheeks tattoo
face mini flush blush and the new
exclusive shade it's so happy together a
perfect doll pink and then a mini candle
like a little healing powder duo and fan
favorite shade rosy glow so again you
get the makeup bag and then the four
mini products and that's $38 again I'm
not really interested in this I'm not
interested in the makeup I get all super
cute I get it that's so much fun they're
putting their animals on it I love it
I'm such an animal lover I love my dog
love it
but I'm not really interested in either
of the shades like the lipstick shades
aren't I don't know totally me I don't
shivering nude that doesn't really seem
for me in the oxblood not really I would
like to be able to try out the two face
blushes I've actually been able to try
like a sample of the candlelight glow
and I wasn't a huge fan so simply
because of what's inside it doesn't
scream out to me so I'm not gonna spend
the $38 on that as well but of course
let us know what you guys think and then
the last thing in the collection is to
facing Kat Von D better together best
filling at mascara and liner duo so this
is 20 dollars it comes with the
best-selling mascara and liner duo from
Kat Von D and to face so you get the
tattoo liner in trooper which is in
black and then the Omega volumizing
better than sex mascara
they are minis $20 I think it's super
overpriced for too many products I'm
sorry but I don't I don't really get it
I don't get why it's $20 it just seems
expensive to me for two minis that like
every so often at Ulta when you make a
purchase of like 30 or 35 dollars for
Too Faced you get a free deluxe mini
better than sex mascara I have like 4 of
them at my house right now because you
get the minis like it just doesn't make
any sense to me why I'm gonna pay $20
for it just I think it's overpriced so
my thoughts on the collection overall I
definitely think it is very pricey I
understand
Kat Von D two very big brands they can
charge that amount of money because
people are still gonna buy it
people are buying it I know people are
buying it people are excited about it
that's fantastic but for me I'm gonna
pass over it just for all the reasons
that I stated it let me know what you
guys think of the collection let me know
what you think again I'll leave my prior
video link down below so you can see
kind of the differences in my thoughts
now that a couple months the past and
the collection is actually here but
definitely let me know what you think
about the collection if you're a huge
fan of toothpaste and a huge fan of Kat
Von D this is like perfect this is like
makeup collection goals for you so I
like it I think the the collab was a
good idea I think the packaging is super
cute very very eye-catching but it's not
gonna be a collection for me so the next
one that I want to talk about is one
that was requested from a subscriber she
asked if I would talk about the color
grain Queen of Hearts
eyes shadow palette so I wanted to talk
about this one because I'm actually
really unfamiliar with the brand colored
brain and I would love to get your
guys's feedback as well you know I make
these will have a video it's not only to
you know go through what I'm gonna buy
and that but I asked oftentimes I'm
asking your guys's opinion your guys's
feedback do you have this are you
familiar with this brand etc etc because
it really honestly helps me out but
hopefully it's helping other people out
who are reading through the comments so
I definitely wanted to touch on this one
so like I said it's the color brain
queen of hearts palette so I'm looking
at the color terrain website this is a
$50 I shadow palette it is limited
edition so it's a twelve pan palette
with six matte and six of foil shades
Contessa is cruelty free and vegan
friendly with the exception of ladyship
which contains carmine so I would put a
picture of it here of course as well so
honestly I know that I'm not going to be
buying this mostly just because like I
said that I'm not familiar with the
brand color green $50 is pretty
expensive to me for a twelve pan limited
edition eyeshadow palette again we're
getting into the limited edition so that
immediately is like a red flag to me but
$50 is pretty expensive when I go to try
out a new brand typically I'll try to
buy something not quite super expensive
just because I truly have no idea what
is gonna be like what the shipping is
gonna be like what customer service is
gonna be like what the actual products
gonna be like the package
it's not direct such are the list goes
on however at the top of my head you
know it's it's not something that I
thought I think will be for me and
especially because even if it wasn't
limited-edition I just think $50 is kind
of expensive for the eyeshadow palette
when there are so many more affordable
options out there but I'm very curious
you know have you guys tried coloured
raine i hear i think it's
nikkietutorials talked about their
products quite a bit and she does seem
to like them but i would love to know
you guys as well who don't have discount
codes that you come at me every five
minutes on snapchat with let me know
what you guys think of the coloring
brand do you guys have the Queen of
Hearts limited edition pilots you have
anything else from coloring that you
would highly recommend again just
looking at the palette it looks really
pretty there are a couple shades in
there that kind of catch my attention
kind of like that gold one being one of
them there's a very interesting like
orange red it looks like in there but
again it doesn't look like anything so
unique to the point where I don't think
I could get these shades in different I
shadow palettes and especially more
affordable i shadow palettes if that
makes sense so for those reasons I'm not
going to get the Queen of Hearts eye
shadow palette from color grain but
again I would love to know your guys's
feedback so please do leave that in the
comments below but those are just kind
of my thoughts on the color green eye
shadow palette and color drain in
general so let us know what you think in
the comments down below but I'm gonna be
passing over this one the next one I
want to talk about is from morphe
brushes now I do love morphe brushes
they're a brand that I've been buying
for for a very long time before I
started at YouTube when I was just
watching YouTube before I had a channel
I was purchasing from morphe really
liked them as a brand really like their
products I think they're really
affordable but they have great brushes
great eyeshadow palettes etc they
recently came out with two new eyeshadow
palettes these immediately were getting
a ton of attention a lot of hype they
were saying to a lot of influencers we
were seeing a lot of snaps and swatches
and tutorials with the palettes before
they came out so they recalled the
bronzed mocha palette and then the
copper spice palette or 25a 25b
for the palette names they were $17.99
and each one contained 25 different
eyeshadow palettes and then like one was
more of a cool tone of one was more of a
warmer tone eyeshadow palette when I saw
these I immediately got very very
curious I loved
morpheus like 35 eyeshadow palettes I
have the 3500 and the 35 T I think
they're great
really love their eyeshadows these
palettes just looked really nice to me I
like the packaging on them the the pan
sizes still looked nice and big
they were $17.99 it compared to like the
35 eyeshadow palettes which have 35
eyeshadows and them those are usually
around 20 to 99 and you can typically
find a discount code for 10% off morphe
from any of the major influencers please
believe me just watch their snapchats
it'll be on their snapchats the entire
time
Serkis kind of go the whole day so you
can always find a discount code from
morphe so $17.99 425 pan eyeshadow
palette I thought was very affordable
and the swatches that I was seeing
looked absolutely amazing especially
their shimmer shades it just looked like
perfection I was so so super interested
in these I wanted to get him I was
pretty sure I was gonna get the copper
spice palette that was the one I really
had my eye on but I was like I don't
know maybe I'll get both I just thought
that they looked super intriguing so
then they launched but you guys have no
idea where I'm going with this
so I also do want to point out that they
were a limited edition but I still was
like I really want those felt like this
is how much I want those palettes that
they're learning to edition I'm still
gonna buy them so the day that they
launched was December 26
they've already launched at the time
gonna film in this video so they
launched on December 26 and I see that
the launch time is going to be 12 p.m.
my time and I'm thinking to myself this
is probably not gonna work out for me
because I knew there was a very good
chance I was gonna be on the road at
that time coming back home from being
out of town for the holidays and so I
was like I don't know maybe I should
just get my morphe account ready get my
cart ready because I do have free
shipping on orders over $100 and a lot
of times I do like to hit that and it's
not just filling my cart with pointless
items when I find really unique about
morphe not only do they have great
brushes great brushes I really like
their brushes they have a makeup sponge
I've been wanting to try out for a long
time but they also do have different
brands on there that you can buy and
they have flutter lashes on there and I
really wanted to pick up some more of
the isolate lashes which are some of my
favorite lashes and they also have the
think they're like the Celilo lashes
from make up Kayla that I hear
Jacqueline Hill talked about all the
time she's always raving a bottom so I
was going to get those lashes I'm saying
about getting some blinking mute lashes
and I mean combine it with getting two
of the eyeshadow palettes like I was
gonna hit the hundred dollars no problem
so I was like okay maybe I should prep
my car and get ready for it and you know
just at the time of launch just you know
quickly be able to go and add them to my
cart and checkout well this past weekend
was Christmas we were doing something
Friday night Saturday night Sunday night
I mean it was just go go go non-stop I
was barely able to get on my computer so
it didn't work I didn't have my cart
ready when we were in the vehicle at 12
o'clock as they launched I was trying to
pull up the morphe website on my phone
I'm not a huge fan of checking out on
the phone and just being on the phone in
the car in general trying to read things
I get very not to get it very sick but
I'm still trying to do it it wasn't
working the website was crashing I was
like whatever I get home I'm kind of
feeling over it I unpacked my bags I
plugged my laptop back in and it's about
five o'clock now so the launch has been
happening for five hours and I'm like
you know what whatever I'll just go back
in I'll try to get on it'll be fine I go
in I see that they have a bundle for
them it was a bundle and it was maybe
like three dollars cheaper than buying
them separately together so I add the
bundle to my cart and it goes through
and I'm like okay perfect so they're my
cart great I have the lashes real quick
and the makeup sponge and go to checkout
and Palace out of stock I'm like okay
whatever that I was I was like okay I
got so excited because I was able to add
them to my bag but I would I actually
went to check out it said out of stock
so I was like that was really pointless
like whatever so I don't know they must
have sold out just at that time I don't
know it was weird it was annoying but
that means that yeah they sold out in
five hours both how it's sold out so I'm
like you know it's just super annoying
guys so unfortunately I wasn't able to
get him like well I buy it well I tried
but I couldn't buy it and of course
they're limited edition but also of
course Morpheus come on and said you
know because they were so popular
they're bringing them back of course I
mean that happens all of the time with
limited edition products colour-pop
especially is known for being like
limited edition limited edition limited
quantity limited quantity oh but we're
gonna bring it back like I mean it's
just I'm like why not just make more in
the first place it doesn't I do not
understand it I just I just can't
understand it but honestly I don't know
if I would try to repurchase them in the
future because it just frustrates me and
I feel like even if they did relaunch it
would have to be that thing where I'm on
my phone in a vehicle no matter where it
is wake up in the middle of the night
have to purchase them right at that
moment or they're gonna be gone and I
don't know if I want to go through the
house a little bit again because it just
makes me mad every time that I try to
buy something and something like that
happens it just frustrates me and like
puts me off so like I don't I don't
think now as of right now it depends
probably on when they relaunch as well
if I'll get them at this time I'm
letting no because that launch made me
sell frustrated it's crazy to sell out
of a product in five hours it's crazy
it's crazy to me so unfortunately I'm
not getting the more view palette I
tried to get both of them I tried to get
two extras for a giveaway and it did not
work so I'm so sorry I won't be able to
include those in a giveaway I won't be
able to do swatches or tutorials with
them but I tried I give them a best shot
it didn't work let me know what did you
guys get the pallets which pile did you
get did you get both of them which one
are you excited for did you try to get
them and it didn't work out they were
already sold out let me know in the
comments down below but the morphe 25
egg 25b pellets were a no-go for me and
then I just have one more product to
talk about it is a drugstore product
I've been getting asked a lot of
questions about this this is the L'Oreal
infallible total cover foundation so
I'll put it insert a picture in here of
its it looks very similar to like the
Loreal Pro glow like similar type of
packaging except like a slimmer to
bottle like it comes in I think twelve
different shades I'm looking at the
L'Oreal website it says up to 24 hour
total color foundation with a weightless
feel and a new pro look of long-wear
L'Oreal website it's saying it's $12.99
I have seen it for $13.99 as well at the
drugstores which is pricey very pricy to
me the drugstore foundation I'm not very
impressed with the drugstore prices keep
going up but at the drug stores that I
shop at we can't do any sort of color
matching and they have a like stricter
policy on returns a lot of times they
won't let you return something like
makeup if it's been opened so if you get
a shade and it doesn't match you then
you're just stuck with it and for the
price tag I think that should change I
don't know let me know if your as this
drugstores do that but I remember trying
to return a foundation shade once to
Walgreens and they were like no I was
like okay my bad so this one I wanted to
include this one to ask your guys's
opinions if you would want me to try it
out and do like a testing of it and
review check-in first impression type of
video I did it with the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi cushion foundation like last
year whenever that was released and it
seemed like people really enjoyed it I
was thinking about maybe I could do one
for that I am getting down there on a
couple of my foundations so I've been
wanting to get a new foundation recently
and I just wasn't sure which one to get
so I'm leaning towards buying this one
but I really wanted to get your guys's
opinion and if you would want that video
because like I said $12.99 $13.99 I
almost would rather just go to Sephora
and purchase a high-end foundation and
know I can get color matched and return
it if need be so I want to see your
guys's opinion and then if you do want
to see it hopefully it can be something
like I have a coupon at CVS or it's like
by L'Oreal like to L'Oreal products get
something half off or something some
sort of deal because I don't want to pay
$13.99 full price for a drugstore
foundation so I'd have to look into see
what kind of deals I can get but if you
guys want it I would definitely do that
video like I said I've been wanting a
new foundation anyways I have a lot of
drugstore foundations mostly Maybelline
and L'Oreal L'Oreal pro quo and I love
it like I said I have the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi is one of my absolute
favorites I tried out the cushion
foundation and I really liked that as
well so I'm definitely not opposed to
buying a lot of drugstore foundation I
prefer I tend to prefer them anyways so
I would totally buy this I just wanted
to get your guys's opinion and feedback
on that as well and L'Oreal also came
out with some sponges I saw them over
the weekend and the stores and they have
like a sponge for all over your face
they have a sponge for like under your
eyes and a sponge for like your cheap
but like different types of sponges I
think I would just get the regular old
Beauty sponge and try it out like I
don't need a special sponge for only
certain areas of my face that just seems
really gimmicky and silly to me but I
would definitely be able to get the
foundation and then the sponge and try
mice together and see what it's like and
if it's
worth it and it's worth that heavy price
tag at the drugstore but let me know
what you guys think but as of right now
I'm definitely leaning on buying this I
just want to try new foundation
I really just stand behind the Loreal
foundations I think they're really good
so if I can find a coupon or some sort
of discount I'll probably be picking
that out but also let me know if you
guys would want to see that video
because then I could get it on my
schedule for 2017 which is crazy this is
the last week of 2016 that's really
weird
but let me know what you guys think in
the comments down below but I'm leaning
towards YES on the L'Oreal infallible
total cover foundation and that is going
to be the last product that I'm talking
about in this will I buy a video all
right guys so that is another week of a
will I buy it I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video or found it
helpful leave me some comments down
below let me know what you think about
the products that I mentioned have you
gotten them will you get them are you
