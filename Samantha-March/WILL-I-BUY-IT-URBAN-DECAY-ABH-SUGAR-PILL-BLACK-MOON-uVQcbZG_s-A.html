today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my Bolivia videos every
single website where I'm chatting about
some new makeup releases and launches
letting you know a little bit about them
and also talking over if I'm planning to
pick them up or pass over them and as
always I have left to chat about this
week so why don't I go ahead and get
started right so Before we jump into I'm
sorry if my lip color looks a completely
crazy I changed it three times still not
happy with it but my lips were like
please stop scrubbing off lipsticks this
is getting crazy but it's a to chat
about the first product here I was
getting a bunch of tags on this release
from Black Moon cosmetics they're coming
out with a new eyeshadow palette and
it's called orb of light and then in
parenthesis it says a full moon I'm
looking out the train window on
Instagram like I normally do so I will
have her Instagram link to my
description box down below says it is
eight matte eyeshadows and a design that
opens to reveal a full moon and has a
hardshell plastic casing with a mirror
and it's going to be $48 it'll be
available February 9th on their website
so I'll have a the best photo that I can
insert it in here and I will say that
I'm not super familiar with a black moon
at cosmetics I would love to know I love
getting feedback on brands that I
haven't made a purchase from yet so I'd
love to know if anybody has purchased
from Black Moon Cosmetics like what
would you recommend from them things
like that I would really love to know
that next thing is really interesting I
will say that I think the packaging is
very unique and I like the way that the
shadows are kind of set up in there I
think that looks really cool but I'm not
sure I guess for eight shades for 48
dollars
I don't know I guess I think that that's
kind of pricey but I do like the
packaging but I like the actual shades
inside I like the actual shade
selections if that makes any sense
looking at the swatches I feel like the
swatches show me better than just the
product packaging but there looks to be
like a really cool light pink in there
and then almost kind of like a grayish
taupe shade and then kind of this
mustard yellow and these Reds like I'm
actually intrigued by the actual shade
selection in there I think it looks
pretty I know it's only eight shades and
I know it's all matte but I
I count like old matte pallets that's
what I tend to lean towards versus like
all shimmer so I like on that pallets
and I can get a lot of use out of them
so actually I was pretty interested in
this one to be honest just I liked the
shade selection that they had in there
and I'd be interested in trying out new
brands that's one thing that I
definitely want to do and I feel like I
say that a lot though like I want to try
to branch out and I want to try out more
brands now of course it's not gonna be
the best time for me to do that we're
still kind of in this like weird thing I
think it's been like three weeks now but
we're still kind of in our weird period
of life where my husband lost his job
about three weeks ago so that definitely
impacts my will i buy it videos because
it's not quite as easy and not saying it
was easy for me before just to buy
anything and everything and I definitely
did not do that but especially right now
it's just you know you're being a little
bit stricter on what it is that you're
buying across the board but I feel like
I was I was intrigued by this one and
maybe if we weren't going through it
right now I would consider purchasing it
I feel like the thing that's holding me
back is that it's $48 and as a brand
I've never purchased from before so I'm
a little unsure of like how their
shipping is customer service like I say
that in video is quite a bit but that's
why I like to get feedback from others
because I feel like it truly is really
helpful so if anybody has purchase from
Black Moon Cosmetics please leave your
your feedback down below let me know if
you're interested in this one but I have
to say I think it's a little bit pricey
which is kind of a bummer but the shades
inside and the packaging it did catch my
attention so that's kind of where I'm at
with the Black Moon at cosmetics that
definitely intrigued me I'm not gonna
get it right now but it had my interest
for sure I also feel like I'm like hella
squinting because it is so bright
outside it is snowing so hard right now
and we already have I mean I'm not a
weatherman but we have like three inches
probably outside and it's still coming
down I'm like oh why why but moving on I
have a collection here from sugarpill
this is the sugar pill little twin stars
Pro makeup collection it says it's
limited edition it's already out it
released on a February first let's see
it says there is a liquid lipstick duo
for $36 also an eye shadow palette for
$38 looks like that has at six different
shades or
you can get the complete collection
which is $79 and it also does include a
makeup bag says it'll be available on
the sugarpill website and also on beauty
lish if things are still in stock I will
of course have them linked down below in
my description box so I'm not super
familiar with sugarpill I haven't made a
purchase from them but I feel like every
once in a while I hear their name thrown
out they're thrown in there somewhere so
again this is another one that I want to
know some feedback let me know you guys
know I read all the comments I respond
to I'm gonna say like 98% of the
comments probably 99% of the comments I
try to respond to as long as they're
like nice and you know not really mean
I'll respond to them I like to know I
feel like that's helpful for me and I'm
sure other people reading the comments
you know that probably helps them out as
well I'm not going to get these the
liquid lipstick duo for $36 that doesn't
interest me enough right now and you
know I'm trying to be like real good
with my makeup collection and being
happy with what I have you know all that
fun stuff that we have such a hard time
doing is makeup lovers so I'm gonna pass
over those 36 you know kind of pricey
the eyeshadow palette for 38 I will say
that it caught my attention I feel like
the shades inside that look pretty
unique so I thought that was fun but
I've been seeing some people say that
like the pastel colors from sugarpill
aren't that good I want to say my friend
Angelica she does a series like this as
well and I think she was just talking
about it fairly recently and she said
she didn't like a palette and then I
think I saw makeup struggles comment and
say the pastels from sugarpill are not
as good but like the regular like matte
shades they're better or something like
that so kind of the feedback I was
seeing and then seeing other people
respond and then some comments on
Instagram and stuff people are saying
that they don't feel like those shades
from sugarpill
are quite the best so when I see things
like that I'm like okay I can pass over
at then $38 for a six shades does seem a
little bit more pricey and well I feel
like the shades are intriguing it's
definitely not like my comfort zone so
to purchase something a little bit more
expensive from a brand that I'm a little
bit unknown with maybe not the best
decision as of right now so I feel like
I could actually pass over it fairly
easily but I will say that it caught my
attention but when I started looking
more into it and hearing other people
talk about it I was like oh
okay I can talk myself out of it so I
did but that's kind of what I think
about the sugar pill and little twin
stars and also I'm not really sure what
little twin stars is to be completely
honest with you I don't know what that
is I thought maybe there was something I
could click on but I'm not really sure
what little twin stars is so if you guys
know you can let me know in the comments
but but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over that one it's limited edition you
know all that stuff that I'm like trying
to think really hard on before I make a
purchase but I'm gonna go ahead and say
no to this one but I'd love to know did
you already pick something up from this
collection or are you planning on doing
it and you're super pumped about it I
would like to know already so I have two
different new releases from uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills to chat about so a
Nastasia is releasing some new powder
bronzers so they're gonna have six
different shades and each bronzer is
going to be twenty eight dollars so
it'll be available February 20th on
their websites and starting in stores
and March 6 at like Sephora Ulta and
Macy's so I have to say that I'm super
interested in these and when I stopped
on saw SIA was coming out them I was
like well I do I want you so bad
I really love bronzers it's something
that I very rarely skip in my makeup
application I just love the way that
bronzing looks on me personally and so
I'm pretty interested in these $29 for
one bronzer is a lot of money though so
I feel like if I were to get this one I
would purchase it from either Sephora
all time be able to use my points or I
still have some money on us a four gift
card like it would be like one of those
things where it'd be like a budget by
somehow you know what I'm saying I
wouldn't want to pay the full twenty
eight dollars for the bronzer that makes
sense but if I had points I could cash
in or a gift card or there's a really
good deal or 20% I offer Ebates has a
big kick back something along those
lines I feel like I would purchase the
brother because it did have me pretty
excited I really I don't even know why
it is but I liked the packaging I
thought that looked pretty and I was
just I don't know I was just into these
sometimes I don't know how to explain
certain things like you're either into
something or you're fat and I was just
into these but then the other item that
Anastasia is releasing soon is a new
highlighter is in collaboration with
Emrys
and it looks freakin gorgeous let me
find the photo okay so this is going to
be their second collaboration and this
is called golden sand dunes and it's
going to be $28 and it says it'll be
available February 14th on the website
and then March in other stores this
looks gorgeous
I just watched kathleenlights as she did
a video with it and she applied it and
it looked absolutely beautiful
I'm so into this once again once again
I mean $28 for one highlight we're
talking a little bit more money and
again it's gonna be the same thing like
I'm somehow gonna try to get a deal on
those highlights but it looks really
really gorgeous I'll say that I'm not
super super familiar with I'm Raziel
like her name is familiar to me and I
know like I've seen her different places
I know that she's collabed with Anasazi
in the past like I've seen her name pop
up but she's not necessarily an
influencer like you know there's just
sometimes with beauty bloggers or
influencers who if they do a collab
you're like I have to have that I have
to have that because they're one of my
favorites they're one of my top fives
like I just want to support that kind of
thing
sometimes that definitely gives me a
pull to buy something that's a
collaboration in this instance that's
not necessarily the case but I still
think this looks absolutely beautiful I
think the packaging looks beautiful I
think the highlight itself looks
beautiful the swatches I've seen seeing
it on people
everything has looked really really
gorgeous so once again it's just that
$28 is a little bit a little bit high
for me but if I can get some sort of
discount deal or something worked out
there I do think that I would purchase
it because it looked really gorgeous
so both the bronzer in the highlight the
new releases from anastasiya both of
those are calling my name Eddie and then
the last item that I want to talk about
is something that I just saw today and
the tank started coming in and I was
like all right I had something else
planned for today's video but we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna talk
about a new mini eyeshadow palette from
Urban Decay
this is the naked petite heat eyeshadow
palette oh boy
it's gonna have six shades inspired by
The Naked heat palette five are gonna be
mattes and one is a demi matte though
there will be a mirror and it's going it
to be $29 will be available of February
22nd those giving us no tags on
and some funny looking emojis on it
because if you do not know I actually
really did not like the Urban Decay
Naked heat pellet and I was so bummed
about it I purchase it myself
right away I was so excited for it and
unfortunately I ended up returning it I
did not like it at all I love urban
decay one of my favorite brands I wear
so much from them I say really good
things about a lot of their other
products but that was one that just did
not work for me and I was super bummed
about it so when I saw the petite heat
coming out I was like no I'm not gonna
get this one
$29 for six shades I mean it looks cute
it looks like a cute little trouble
palette that you could take with you and
these shades inside are like my shades
my tones
I love the warm tones that's why I
bought the naked heat in the first place
but it just was not my favorite I will
say that I've tried another I've tried
the naked smoky palette from Urban Decay
I think it that one is a gift and I do
still have it and I think it's just okay
like I just think the naked formula for
some reason with urban decay is just not
my favorite I've been trying out the
Chris and Leanne collection and the two
eyeshadow palettes and that collab I
feel like are just hot fire I love them
I think they're fantastic but for some
reason the naked smoky and then the
naked heat just really did nothing for
me so I would not like I was very easily
able to say like no I'm gonna go ahead
and skip over this one because I just
don't love it and I know a lot of people
loved that palette and still do love
that palette which is so fantastic guy
that's a that's amazing when things work
out for you I want everything to work
out for me too and I get really sad when
things don't but no I'm not gonna
purchase this one but I'd love to know
where you so excited when you saw it
maybe you wanted to purchase the naked
heat but now that a minis coming out so
I mean I'm that person who doesn't mind
buying mini it's whether it's lipsticks
skin care minis like I don't care I will
love to save some money and get a mini I
actually mentioned this is kind of
random but and my makeup all I did I
purchased a mini of the Smashbox primer
as a foundation and people actually said
that it's a better purchase if you did
like cost per ounce or something like
that a product it actually ended up
being cheaper than the full-sized or
something like that
I was like you go girl I did not know
that when I bought it but I was pretty
proud when I saw that but especially
when it comes to makeup and certain
products there's just no way you can get
through everything so it's like why not
purchase the mini save a little bit of
money and see if you can actually go
through something probably if you have
the original naked heat you probably
don't need this one Bree I feel like I
don't mind the way that Urban Decay is
doing in this palette because I feel
like they're not just I don't I feel
like there's no trickery there like
they're saying this is a mini of the
naked heat palette and I like that
because sometimes I see brands like
coming out with a new palette but it's
just shades from their other palettes
shoved into one palette but they're like
this is a new palette you're like well
is it though I don't know cuz I mean
I've fallen prey to that I have fallen
prey to that and it doesn't make me
super happy so I like being a little bit
more upfront and transparent about
things I guess that's why I I don't mind
the looks of this mini it does say the
shades I believe they're different
shades it says it's inspired by the The
Naked heat palette but the shades are
different but I mean they look pretty
similar to what I recall being in The
Naked heat but I don't know I thought it
was interesting but it's not gonna be
for me because I didn't enjoyed the
original pilot but I would love to know
are you so excited about the mini you
want it in addition to the full-size or
maybe you want the full-size but it was
a bit off your price range but now you
can try the mini out I don't know let me
know what you think about being naked
petit heat palette from Urban Decay okay
