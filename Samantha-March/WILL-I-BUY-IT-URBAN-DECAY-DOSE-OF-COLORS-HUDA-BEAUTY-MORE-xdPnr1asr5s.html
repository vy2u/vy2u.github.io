I'm excited for today's video because it
is going to be my second edition of will
I buy it so about a month or so ago I
was getting ready to sit down to film a
video and I opened up my snapchat and I
was once again answering so many
questions of am I gonna buy this am I
gonna buy that
am i read this am I gonna buy that and I
was like you know what I should scrap
the video idea that I had and I should
film something along the lines of will I
buy it I was not able to come up with a
catchy or title than that if anyone has
a catchy title for this type of video
please let me know because I'm going to
continue to call it will I buy it until
I can come up with something else but
basically I'm just taking products
usually like new releases and I'm gonna
let you know if I'm going to buy it or
if I'm not gonna buy it and the reasons
for that and I can also give you guys a
little bit you know details as well
about these new releases what they are
when they release how much money they
are where you can find them etc etc so I
was really excited that that video went
over as well as it did I was honestly a
little surprised as well but I mean I
guess from the amount of questions I get
and snaps I get asking me you know I
guess it just kind of makes sense so
that's what today's video is going to be
once again I have five new products to
talk about with you guys today I
actually already have another list of
Fry's products that I could film again I
wanted to try to keep it to five so I
don't make these videos too super long
but seriously I can make these videos as
often as you guys want to see them I do
plan on doing like a couple exclusively
for like holiday collections that are
going to come out but I aren't like I
said I already have another list so I
can do that in like a couple weeks here
to talk about a couple more new releases
obviously the makeup world is crazy new
releases are coming out all the time so
I am really excited to make these videos
for you guys so yes if you ever have any
suggestions of anything that you'd want
to see in these will i buy it videos
please leave them in the comments let me
know on snapchat and I will just keep my
list running but why don't we go ahead
and hop into the first item so how many
people were curious if I was going to
buy is from Urban Decay and it is
they're naked
ultimate basics palette so I'll insert
the pictures over here what this is
it's a 12 all-new matte eyeshadow
palette it's going to be $55 and it
releases on September 18th
so people are curious if I'm going to
get the ultimate basics palette and I'm
gonna I'm gonna let you guys know
something that I don't actually own any
of the Urban Decay Naked palette I
actually don't own any Urban Decay
palettes and I don't even know if I own
any Urban Decay in general I know I have
like an eyeshadow sample from them no
I'm pretty sure I gave it away I don't
even think I have that I'm not sure I
have anything from Urban Decay not
because I don't like them or I don't
think that they are a good brand but for
whatever reason I have just now got
rotated towards purchasing from them I
really wanted to get like the naked
smoky palette I think it was I remember
thinking that one looked really pretty
and I just never pulled the trigger so I
didn't get it but looking at this
palette
once again um I don't think I need it I
I'm not gonna buy this one simply
because it doesn't call to me it doesn't
speak to me if you guys watch my anti
hauls or my other will I buy it if a
product doesn't call out to me I really
try not to give it a lot of
consideration like I don't try to talk
myself into buying makeup because so
many other makeup products speak to me
and wants me to buy them so I don't try
to feel the urge to talk myself into
buying something that doesn't catch me
you know at first glance and maybe if I
was someone who had a couple of the
naked palettes or all the naked palettes
and I would want this one for my
collection I get it the packaging does
look really nice
honestly the swatches like didn't super
blow me away I've watched a couple
makeup tutorials people using it and it
wasn't anything that I was like
definitely gonna need this in my palette
I have the Kat Von D shade and light
palette which is an almond eye shadow
palette I have the Smashbox like the
photo finish matte eye palette and
that's a nama palette I have a lot of
other matte eyeshadows in my collection
so I think I probably have every single
eyeshadow that I see in this palette so
I mean for that reason I really just
don't need to buy it $55 is
pretty pricey in my opinion especially
for just a 12 I shadow pellet oh no this
one I am definitely going to pass on so
the next one I want to talk about is
from dose of colors it is their ice
cream palette you guys this palette like
speaks to me on a certain level because
I love ice cream to an extreme point an
extreme point I live within a walking
distance to Dairy Queen its I love ice
cream so much so when I saw this palette
I was like that is the cutest thing I
love the names of the shadows they look
beautiful but and there is a butt so
like I said the palette is from dose of
colors now I have actually never
purchased from dose of colors I don't
want to think from dose of colors not
because I don't want to there look what
lipsticks are very highly talked about
they came out with like dual pigment
eyeshadows I don't remember what they
were called they come out with those a
while back and I really really wanted to
purchase some of those but I kept
holding back because they are pricier at
this palette the ice cream palette is
$50 which is pricey so everything that
they have is a little bit on the pricier
side and they never have sales from what
I can see and I've heard other people
saying that as well about dose of colors
is that they just never have sales you
also always have to pay for shipping
it's 550 shipping no matter what
according to the FAQ on their website so
even if I were to order
$200 worth of products I'm still gonna
have to pay for shipping and I am
someone who tries to buy anything I can
with either a coupon you know it's on
sale you're getting a free gift yeah at
least get free shipping I mean you get a
ton of great samples like Ebates is
having triple cashback I mean something
I don't like paying full price full
everything for a product that is not the
kind of world that I want to live in you
know so that's always kind of what has
held me back from Brian from dose of
colors because even like morphe is a
website that i absolutely love you have
to spend $100 to get free shipping and
morphe is an affordable brand so to
spend $100 at morphe is actually kind of
difficult when you break it down
and I truly will wait until Murphy is
having like a flash sale they have like
everyone smiled they have like flash
sales and that is when I'm Brenda
marques website and I order as much as I
want because it's on sale and then I can
try to get to the hundred dollars and
get free shipping it's just who I am
guys I can't I can't I can't explain any
better than that but that's just who I
up
I love coupons I love sales I love
discounts dose of colors doesn't seem to
offer that that is what has always
helped me back from fine from dose of
colors so not only have I never
purchased some dose of color so I don't
know the quality of their products
myself which to just jump right in and
buy a $50 eyeshadow palette is kind of
like whoo I don't know if that's a good
idea or not also it is limited edition
and I'm I'm trying not to buy as much
limited edition like I'm trying to be
conscious of it
because like for example the Too Faced
to be peach palette one of my favorite
favorite eyeshadow palettes but I feel
bad using it and using it in tutorials
and talking about it because it's no
longer for sale and so many people
didn't get it so as I'm getting more and
more confident in doing makeup tutorials
on YouTube and also on Instagram I'm
trying not to use the things that people
can't get because I'm saying look how
great this palette is I'm using it today
go get it oh sorry you can't sorry about
that
like so I'm trying to keep that in mind
as well am I gonna stop buying limited
edition all together there's no way
there's there's no way but I'm trying to
be conscious of that so we have all that
factored in and then it is $50 it is a
little bit more expensive do get 10 a
shadows they look great I love their
names they look so pretty like I'm
looking at the picture right here I'll
of course the inserting pictures here as
well it really looks amazing I honestly
really really want this palette but I
think I'm gonna have to say no this this
could be one that I honestly might
change my mind on because of what the
shades look like they just they just
speak to me but as of right now and
that's for all those reasons that I
listed honestly I'm passing on it right
now so I don't know I just I wanted like
throw it out there that this is one that
I continually keep going back and forth
on so you might see me purchase it in
the future but I'm like 80% sure
that I'm not gonna buy it but I want to
talk about as a new one from Anastacio
Beverly Hills you guys have probably
heard about it because it's been all
over the place but it is the new stick
foundations I saw these come out I got
pretty excited I started watching the
early reviews and the early tutorials
and a lot of people are saying that they
really like it so I am very very curious
about these I've actually never used
basic foundation before never have so
I'm curious to try stick foundation I
know that makeup forever stick
foundation is like everybody's favorite
thing in the whole world that's
constantly sold out like there's so much
craziness around it I do really like
anasazi Beverly Hills as a brand at
first launched on her website so you
could only get the foundation sticks on
the website they are now available on
Sephora as well so any links that I can
find for any of these that are already
on sale I will leave in the description
box below so the a BH foundation sticks
are on sale right now on her website and
then also on Sephora I don't know if
they're on alpha but I know for sure
they are on Sephora so I was thinking
about getting these and then I kind of
looked into them a little bit more
they've 26 different shades I believe it
is which is crazy but also what is cool
is that it seems like you can use these
also for contour and highlight in
addition to foundation so you can buy
you a foundation stick you can buy it
have it stick you my contour stick and
use all of it for your face and you
might be thinking well that sounds
really expensive which yeah it probably
is but the foundation sticks are only
twenty-five dollars which I actually
don't think it's super bad I mean for my
Clinique foundation it was $27 so I mean
25 dollars I don't know I haven't done
the math because math is hard and I try
not to do math as often as I can
I haven't looked into like ounces and
dollars per ounce and all that stuff but
twenty-five dollars for the product in
general to me I was like okay that
doesn't seem awful I don't think I would
buy the contour six in the highlight
sticks just for me I don't think I would
need that but an actual foundation stick
I think I'm gonna go ahead and purchase
one of these actually I was going to do
it a little bit sooner but I didn't want
to or
off the Anasazi website I would rather
purchase it on Sephora so once I did see
that it was going to be available on
Sephora I decided to wait on it and you
might be asking well like why are you
waiting where I do you want to order it
on Sephora because you get points and
you get free samples and then you build
up your points and you can get more
samples and other good stuff see this is
the world that I live in I don't like
paying full price for things that I'm
not going to get anything back for it
know what I'm saying you know what I'm
saying so that honestly Beverly Hills
foundation sticks I believe that I am
going to purchase I'm pretty excited for
it though yeah foundation stick I'm
gonna do it so the next item I want to
talk about is from Tarte cosmetics and
it is the big blush book too
so I'm assuming that means that they've
had a big blush book come out I am not
familiar with that blush book but says
this is the second one it is $60 and you
get eight new full-size blushes inside
so instead of pictures over here and it
does look very large like I've seen
people's photos of it and I'm like that
looks like a big old blush book make
sense so tart is one of my favorite
brands absolutely love them purchase a
lot from them I think they're great but
I'm not gonna buy this so my biggest
reason I'm not gonna buy it so it is $60
which that is expensive the only place
that I see it available for sale and is
for sale now the only place I'm seeing
it for sale is at Tarte I checked the
fours website and I didn't see it there
and I didn't see anything about it being
at all to either so I think you can only
purchase it on tarts website which I
will say Tarte does have good deals too
so it's never that I don't want to
purchase from Tarte because they
typically will have like ten percent off
15% off you know something
so it's you know nothing against that
it's just $60 for blushes seems like a
lot to me and I am NOT a blush person
truly I don't own a ton of blushes I
don't feel like I need to own a ton of
blushes and like a blush palette I don't
know like I hear that tarts blushes are
really fantastic and it sounds weird I
just don't feel like I need a blush
palette I've heard really good things
about the Tarte blushes and everybody
seems to love them I did recently get
the herb Rouge eyeshadow palette it does
blush in there and I think it's a
fantastic blush I really enjoy it but I
just don't feel like I need an only
blush palette maybe someday I'll change
my mind I know tart comes out with a lot
of limited edition blush palettes as
well this one is also limited edition so
you guys know but I just don't feel like
I need a blush palette because I truly
don't care about blush that much some
days I even forget to wear it like I put
bronzer on and I leave my house and like
oh shoot
dimple blush on and you know my day
isn't rude like if I didn't put eyeliner
on then my days ruined so you know it's
just not something that I feel like I
personally need in my collection so
that's why I'm not gonna buy it but I
think it looks really cool I think the
concept is really cool I don't feel like
it looks super easier for traveling and
I don't know if I feel like I would need
that many different blushes for when I'm
traveling but hey I mean I guess you
never know but I like the concept of it
I think it looks really cool it's just
it's a little too pricey for me blush
isn't my favorite makeup item and you
know it's just something that I really
don't think that I need them that I want
to talk to you about is an eyeshadow
palette from huda beauty called the
textured shadows palette and it is the
rose gold edition this palette looks
completely stunning and this is one when
the picture started coming out of it the
snap started coming in are you getting
that palette are you getting that
palette if we can't get that palette for
a giveaway they're gonna get that
palette and so I have been looking at
all the pictures of it I've been looking
at the swatches of it and first up I
just want to say that this palette looks
amazing it looks beautiful the swatches
look amazing it has 18 eyes shadows
I believe I'm saying that quickly it has
18 different eyeshadows there is master
shimmers there's gold so there's pinks
there's deeper colors there's Browns
like it looks like everything that you
need in a palette all wrapped up with
hooter size on it I have the hood of
beauty lashes Samantha great lashes
really enjoy and that's all I have from
huda beauty she recently came out with
liquid lipsticks I didn't pick any up
when I heard really good things about
them so it's kind of hard I wanted to be
assured that I included this in this
video because it's been like probably
the most requested one I don't maybe
maybe the most requests I want to
like start keeping tally mark so I know
which ones are the most requested one
but I felt like this one was really high
up there but a few problems with me
being able to say am I gonna buy it or
not that I haven't found the price yet
I've looked at who it is Instagram I've
looked at trend mood I've read bustle I
read a lure I can't find a price on this
yet and I truly have no idea what this
beauty could be I'm assuming it's going
to be pretty pricey but I I don't know
yet so that really is the hardest
hardest thing from me saying like yes
I'm gonna buy it or no I'm not gonna buy
it there hasn't been a release date yet
for the day that I'm filming there
hasn't been a release date yet all of
the posts are just saying that is
launching in September I'm still filming
this in August so it's coming in
September hopefully we would get a price
you know sometime here soon so if the
price does happen to come out as you
know I'm editing this video or haven't
gotten up yet I will leave it in the
description box below for you guys but
really that's probably going to be my
deciding factor giblet that I also saw
that it will be sold at Sephora which
makes me a little bit more likely to
purchase the palette but honestly when I
first thought I was like no I don't
think I need it you know probably not
and then I looked at it more and then I
looked at the swatches and I was like
actually you know that palettes just
stunning it has 18 different shades
which is a lot you know the other
eyeshadows I talked about had like 12
and 10 eyeshadows this one has 18 they
look beautiful especially like the
shimmer ones they look almost like
foiled shadows from the swatches that
I've seen it looks gorgeous so right now
I have to say that I'm on the fence it's
going to depend on the price point and
if for sure it's sold at Sephora for me
to say yes but if I feel like the price
is worth it
I think I will go for it I think that I
will but I'm really curious
I just feel like this one could be
really really expensive so we will see
you know you sure you guys would get an
update a haul video review video swatch
video of course if I do end up getting
it but yeah if it ends up being too
pricey I won't do it but if I feel like
it is affordable and something that I
can afford at the time that it launches
then I will pick one up so sorry that I
have to end on a wishy-washy note
sometimes you know the prices don't get
released with certain items I think
there was one from my last will I buy a
video as well that didn't have a price
on it yes it was like it's hard for me
to say but when I was like an 80% yes I
mean I just hope it's not like you know
a hundred dollars or something I truly
have no idea how much is gonna be so
well let's wait and see for the price
but probably going to get this one
everything for my second will I buy a
video I hope that you guys enjoy this
one found it helpful and I would love to
know of the products that I mentioned
are you guys gonna buy them or not have
you already purchased some of them that
have already come out for sale I would
love to know because I'm always curious
what you guys are buying as well and you
know your reasons like do we have any of
the same reasons for Weber buying
something or why we're not doing
something I always love to know what we
have in common that is super fun for me
please do leave in the comments below

want to see in my next will I buy a
video I plan on doing the will I buy it

seems like you guys really do want to
