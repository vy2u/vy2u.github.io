today's video is gonna be a new well I
buy it I post move Olivia videos every
single one site where I'm chatting about
some new makeup releases and lunches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then also chatting over if I'm going
to pick them up or pass over them as
always I'd love to chat about this week
so why don't we go ahead and get started
alright before we jump in I'm just kind
of feeling like in a off mood today you
know so if my my demeanor seems a little
different I'm just kind of having one of
those days where I'm like wow you know
oh yeah shake it up shake it up shake it
off okay let's talk about new makeup
already so first of all I got a whole
bunch of tags on this one fairly
recently this is a new collection from
wet and wild says Gothel graphic a goth
is meeting holographic for a new edge a
spring at 2018 collection I'm gonna be
reading off the turn mood one Instagram
quite a bit here so we'll have our
Instagram page up linked in my
description box as usual okay so it's a
fairly big collection so we have two
mega glow highlighting powders for $4.99
a mega glow highlighting stick for $6.99
a mega glow loose highlighting powder
for $6.99 will be for mega last liquid
catsuit eyes shadows of her $4.99 for
mega last liquid catsuit metallic
lipsticks in $4.99 three mega liner
metallic liquid eyeliners for 399 so as
will be available february 20th on their
website and March 1st in other stores
all right so let me go through this
collection here I'll say right off the
bat that holographic is not necessarily
my thing and as I'm reading I'm seeing a
bunch of metallic it's not personally my
makeup vibe so I kind of knew that right
away right when I saw the collection I
was like mm not sure if this is totally
gonna be my thing so first up the mega
glow highlighting powders for $4.99 I
will say that I feel like everything in
the collection is priced just so well
wet wild is a brand who really likes to
keep their prices low for the majority
of our products which is freaking
awesome so the prices on all of this I
think are pretty bomb the mega glow
highlighters I only own one I own
precious petals and I don't love it and
I feel like a lot of people really love
that highlight and it was one that just
doesn't really speak to me a lot I've
been thinking about grabbing another one
and
maybe kind of doing that thing where was
I talking about this with the Anastasio
lipsticks I was like what didn't work
for me so I bought another thinking
maybe the shade would work better but I
don't know maybe for highlights then at
only five dollars like maybe I could
grab me another one and see if it works
out better for me but I will say so that
was kind of my first thought when I saw
these highlights I was like well maybe
I'll grab another one of those
highlighters and see if it works butter
but neither of the shades necessarily
are calling to me so I don't think I did
I think I would do something in there
more regular like permanent type of line
because this will be a limited edition
collection so I'm gonna pass over the
highlighting powders the mega blow
highlighting stick interesting
interesting but again not my personal
makeup taste not what I prefer I prefer
a powder highlight I just got a couple
of the liquid highlighters from the balm
and I'm trying so hard I used them in a
first impression video and I was like ah
I don't think I'm doing this right I'm
trying so hard to make them work but
like cream highlights stick highlights
liquid highlights just not my favorite
for me so I would skip over that they
might get glow loose highlighting powder
again not my personal taste lose
highlights loose eyeshadows pigments not
my personal preference I don't reach for
them a lot I have some in my collection
I have a loose highlight in my
collection from the artist Couture one
of the diamond glow powder as I believe
there is what it's called
very rarely touch it because it's messy
I have to spray my brush it gets
everywhere not my personal preference so
I would pass over that the mega less
liquid catsuit I shadow for a 499 so if
I am looking at this correctly so that
looks like like a stick liquid I shout
out that you apply again it's just not
my personal preference not what I tend
to go for I have a couple like these
from Maybelline barely reach for them I
mostly just go into my palettes but you
know five dollars I don't think that's
bad at all so that's pretty good on the
mega liner metallic liquid eyeliner for
399 again metallic like what eyeliner
you see where I'm going with this not
necessarily my vibes and just say you
can get the Gothic graphic box for 39.99
and that includes the full collection so
if you're interested that would be a
good thing so obviously as I was going
through it it's just not my personal
makeup taste and you know what I
don't think that's a bad thing at all
sometimes when collections come out or
when these trends come out that aren't
my personal vibe
I have not mad at all if I don't want
something from the collection because
there's so much makeup out there there's
always so many new releases I do these
videos every single week and I always
have so much to say and even more than I
could be saying in these videos because
there's always so much makeup so when I
see a collection or something new come
out and it's not you know it doesn't get
my attention I don't think I would use
it a lot I don't think I would utilize
the items whether it's drugstore or
high-end it's okay to say no to it it's
okay to pass over it and that's kind of
how I feel about the wet and wild
collection so for me because it's not my
personal makeup taste I'm gonna go ahead
and pass over it but I would love to
know did you see this and you are like
yes this is red in my alley I have to
have everything you're gonna get the
full collection you're gonna get a
couple items in there I would love to
know so I don't know what happened there
but I looked up at the viewfinder when I
got done talking about went wild and it
was dark it was dark I was like I swear
it was a bit brighter when I started
filming that intro so I had to pull out
my ring light but next up I have this
one's kind of a little bit random but I
did get some it tags on it Laura Mercier
it's coming out with a new a flawless
fusion ultra long wear concealer so I
was thinking maybe I got tagged on it
because I do enjoy concealers but also I
like the laura mercier flawless fusion
foundation I talked about that one in
thinking was the products that I didn't
expect to love because it's a very full
coverage foundation but I really really
enjoyed that one so now she's coming out
this concealer it says a medium to full
coverage concealer that delivers all-day
hydration while creating a crease
resistant natural finish lightweight
blurring powder blend it diffuses light
to smooth the look of fine lines and
create a soft focus effect it delivers
12 hours of wear those transfers sweat
humidity and water resistant for $28 7
sometimes when you read claims on makeup
products like makes my head spin like
wah-wah okay so it does say it is
available now at Nordstrom so I will
have any links that I can find down
below I'm interested I'm interested in
this one what's kind of holding me back
is that I have quite a few high-end
concealers in my collection and I've
actually wanted to switch focus and try
to build up a little bit more of my
drugstore collection because I
have like the Maybelline fit me in the
maple a better skin I've recently used
those up and I would like to repurchase
them because I would like it back in my
collection but also for when I do videos
the tutorials or the get ready with me
is you know things like that I want to
make sure that I'm also incorporating
both drugstore and high-end I want to
have that kind of middle ground I don't
want to be only high-end I don't want to
be only drugstore
I want that middle ground and I've
noticed with my concealer collection it
was when I was doing March Madness that
I really noticed it that I have like two
drugstore concealers compared to like I
don't know what it's like ten high-end
concealers so I'm like I feel like I
need to get a better balance of that so
I think at least for right now I'm gonna
pass over and it's a concealer I know
concealer is not like the most exciting
makeup product release on the planet but
for me I wear concealer every single day
even if I'm not doing like a full face
of makeup or anything like that
I'm typically wearing concealer because
I do have some darkness on my under eyes
like circles that I deal with and I like
it on my eyelids as well so concealer is
important part of my makeup routine so
this one it I did a double take on it
$28 is definitely expensive it's right
up there with some of my favorites from
like urban decay and Kevon Daquan but I
think for right now I'm happy with my
concealer collection and like I said I
would like to focus on drugstore vs.
high-end so I'm gonna go ahead and pass
over the Laura Mercier new flawless
fusion concealer what'd you guys think
when you saw it do you love the
foundation are you interested in trying
out the concealer or is that something
that you're like hmm you can just kind
of like take our leave concealers I'd
like to know so I got quite a few tags
on this release from Too Faced oh yes I
did this is the natural face palette
it's $48 and includes blushes
highlighters and bronzer shades so I'll
post a photo of it on the screen here
it's part of their new like natural
beauty collection that they're doing I
talked about the eyeshadow palette in a
past will i buy it video and now they've
released what the face palette is going
to look like it looks like it has really
nice packaging it has a mirror the shade
sizes look good the shade selections for
me personally what I look for in a face
palette they look like that they would
work for me it does have that lace
overlay texture to it like the iPhone
how that does that I can I can leave
that I don't need that but this I did a
double-take
yeah sure did yeah I did I love face
pallets I have a weakness for face
pallets
I love them I don't really know what
else to say I think it's always so
interesting seeing what it is for people
that really call to them and also at the
same time what doesn't call to them I
was just watching LS the other day and
she did an anti hull and I commented on
there and I said I really enjoy watching
these types of videos whether it be an
anti haul our will i buy it style video
I like watching them especially from
other people who have really different
makeup preferences that me because it's
just fascinating to me I like I like
seeing what cost people's attention and
what doesn't call their attention and
how we're all so different and unique
with our makeup preferences I love it so
that's what I commented on her video
because she definitely has a very
different makeup style than I do and it
was just interesting what what calls to
them what doesn't call to them why they
can pass something over and what not but
for me face palettes and especially face
pellets that have some of my shades in
there that I'm real interested in I am
definitely looking at this one a pretty
hard was on a no buy from Too Faced for
a while I think it was like a full year
and I haven't bought anything from them
for quite some time but I keep waiting
and I keep waiting for that one product
that really really calls to me I thought
it would be the peachy matte palette and
I ended up passing over it but the Sun
I'm curious about I'm curious about this
one what do you guys think kind of
looking at this one a big like would it
be really similar to my Becca a price
geek low face palette I don't see any
swatches yet from this palette so it's
kind of hard to say I'm just looking at
a few photos of it and ones in one light
and ones in a different light so it kind
of looks different so I haven't seen
anyone using it yet I haven't seen the
swatches yet so it's really hard to
start comparing it to something in my
collection but of course it's a face
palette with bronzer blush and highlight
shades like do I really need this one do
I do I but I would like to know what you
guys think but I will say I'm I'm
interested in this one I'm definitely
interested to face you caught my
attention with this one so the final
item that I want to talk about is the
one that I definitely got the most tags
on for sure this is from Urban Decay it
is the back talk palette it says it's
like two pallets at one a double-sided
removable mirrors who act
a divider between the eyeshadow shades
and then the face shades one side has
eight eyeshadows the other side has four
blushes and highlights the entire thing
is going to be $46 I'll try to put the
best photo that I can on the screen here
but when I saw it I didn't know what
brand it was I didn't know anything
about I just saw the photo of it and I
was like who are you and I need you and
I need you right now
and then I thought was Urban Decay like
I freaking love Urban Decay that's
fantastic and then I got a little
worried I was like wonder what that
price is gonna be but this is $46 so
this is one thing that when I'm thinking
about the Too Faced face palette that I
was just talking about
that's $48 for 6 face shades
now we're talking forty six dollars for
eight eyes shadows shades that scream my
name before face shades I think if I was
having to choose I would have to swing
Urban Decay and if I'm thinking like I'm
very much like a brand loyal person as
well and if I'm thinking loyalty versus
breathe I've something Urban Decay's way
because I I mean you hear me talk about
urban decay products a ton that are
favorites of mine so I think if I'm
having to choose between the two because
Too Faced caught my attention so hard I
don't think that I would be able to
justify for myself spending 48 dollars
on that and then also spending $46 on
the Urban Decay I would rather go just
urban decay's so I didn't want to
mention that so when I was thinking
about this video and I was planning
everything together I mean I'm not gonna
lie it and Too Faced caught my attention
it gave me the double take I seriously
considered it but then when I saw this
Urban Decay palette I was like you know
it for me it wouldn't make sense to buy
both I'm sure some other people would
you know be totally fine buying both as
well but for me it wouldn't and I would
rather get the eyeshadows and the face
shades like yes I feel like I feel like
this to me is what I really wanted the
Tarte clay play to to be like I wanted
something that had a shadows and those
different face shades in there for me I
love the original clay play but when I
saw the clay play - was gonna have blush
and highlight in there as well I was
like yes like that's like my all-in
one type of palette and of course when I
want to be extremely disappointed by the
clay plate - so when I see this and I
see those blush and highlight shades and
I see those those mobs and pinks like
urban decay you got me you got me urban
decay this is the one that I really I
don't I don't think I'm gonna be able to
say no to it you know what
my birthday's coming up one more month
one more month I feel like I should I
feel like this palette I feel like we're
like this
I'm really excited over this one if you
cannot tell like I feel like sometimes
when makeup makes this excited and this
happy about something it's okay to cave
I feel like I do a really good job and I
feel like especially lately I have been
doing a really good job on being on a
low by /no by for makeup I feel like
I've been doing pretty darn good
so this Urban Decay palette I think that
she's going to be mine I don't know if I
saw a it just says coming soon on this
post so I'm not a hundred percent when
this will be releasing but I will be
waiting for it I will be watching for it
I'm gonna be eyeing that one let me know
what you think is this something that
totally calls to you it's just something
that made you do a dance like it did for
me because I definitely did is this
something that maybe talk to you out of
another product you were thinking about
like it did for me with the Too Faced
one I would love to know are these just
like not your toner like about

shadow and face palette
