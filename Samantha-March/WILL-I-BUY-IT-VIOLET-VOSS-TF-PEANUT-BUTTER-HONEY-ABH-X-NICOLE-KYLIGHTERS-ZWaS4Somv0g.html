today's video is going to be a will i
buy a video i post my well I bite videos
every single Wednesday where I'm talking
about makeup new makeup releases product
launches and letting you guys know if
I'm going to buy it I'm not going to buy
it a little bit about the product and
then just kind of what goes into the
decision of a real person and making her
makeup purchases I'm super excited for
this week's video because I have had so
many requests about the products that
I'm going to talk about I think this
week's video has been like the most
requested video what the products that
are going to be inside so I'm very
excited to get into it I'm feeling a
little more casual today I just have a
t-shirt on but I think it's super funny
and I want to show you good it says
running on caffeine and dry shampoo and
I just think this is like totally me
I'll just on top left closing i'll leave
it link down below you can get a few
percent off with my code Samantha tabla
is the store that I work for is over my
sister-in-law stuff and I do work with
her for online marketing but I just
thought it was like super comfy and
casual it's a little bit later in the
day from when I film but i have already
filmed another video today on this I
look I just got the lorac brunch palette
so I found the first impression and demo
and then there was still some light so I
thought let's just film another video
but I wanted to be more casual for this
one so i need to stop rambling because
my will I bet videos are always super
long I know so why don't we just go
ahead and get started so the first item
that I want to talk about is from a
violet boss this is the ride or die
eyeshadow palette I was going to talk
about this last week but when I was
going to sit down to talk about it
Alison like couldn't find a lot of
information which was strange but then I
was still getting asked more and more if
I was going to be purchasing it so i
just mentioned violet boss in my seven
brands that I want to try in 2017 if you
haven't seen that video I'll leave a
link down below the violent boss is on
my list of brands but I really hope to
try in 2017 I just think they look
really interesting their eye shadow
palettes always look like super eye
catching to me so the writer died I
shadow palette looking at the Chinaman
one Instagram page it is a 42 shade
which in my previous video I was like
all these I shadow palettes like
ginormous like 42 shades is insane and
it is
$75 so it also does include a mirror I
mean this has like every single shade
under the Sun and they're all know
they're all like girl names I don't see
some math on there though that's really
there's everything Matt shimmers all
different shades transition tuition I
mean oh my gosh it has legitimately
everything in here I really been
struggling with this one because I would
like to get it truly i blood it's just
huge I mean like do you even need
another eyeshadow palette if you have to
die shadow palette I'm struggling with a
price it's $75 I think 10 was saying she
has a ten percent yeah she has ten
percent off hey just I don't know if I
would be able to do it I say a lot of my
will i buy videos that I'm not an
eyeshadow palette junkie I did just
purchased the lorac brunch palette so I
did just get a new eye shadow palette so
it's kind of like do I need this one too
but i really wanted but if i really
wanted i don't know i really want i
think it looks super cool I mean it
looks really good this is one that I'm
really really torn about because I like
it it looks good 42 shades I mean I you
know $75 is definitely more expensive
but 442 shades that's a lot of
eyeshadows and you get a mirror I don't
know if it'd be super easy to travel
with because of how big it is but it's
just like seriously how's everything
inside I don't know this one I'm really
torn about I'm leaning towards getting
it honestly I'm leaning towards getting
it I've been saying that I want to try
out by the thoughts it has every shade
under the Sun and there you can get a
discount that helps a little I'm
honestly I'm leaning towards yes I can't
say for sure like to get this palette
what do you guys think did you already
get it what do you think are you going
to get it I need your guys's opinions I
need your guys's opinions really hard on
this one because I'm just not sure it
just I know it seems like a lot of money
but just it looks really nice the swash
is look good i've been looking at
swatches from Instagram accounts i think
swatches look really nice so i'm leaning
towards getting
but am I sub crazy xenon I shadow
palette junkie is going to buy a 42
shade eyeshadow palette for $75 ha
what's wrong with me huh this is crazy
but I really i think i really like it
guys let me know what you think down the
comments below talk me out of it if you
need to I'm open I'm going to read your
comments let me know Oh everybody has
been asking me about this eyeshadow
palette or body has been asking me about
this eyeshadow palette you guys to face
is coming out with a new eye shadow
palette this is called the peanut butter
and honey palette okay and it is
thirty-six dollars a commis with like
three larger shades and then two four
six smaller shades I am share pictures
in these videos as well let's see it
says it'll be available march first on
Alta March fish on to face and in stores
on March 19th I'm looking at some
swatches on the trend Instagram right
now um yeah no I'm not going to get this
palette I've been talking about to face
in you know my will i buy it in my into
hell videos I'm just not on to face
train right now I think I what did I say
in my last video that we're in a
complicated relationship yeah I don't
know this watch's was nice but it looks
like a neutral palette like it doesn't
look like anything I need the only color
that really stuck out to me was the
yellow I don't know why but that's the
only one that truly stuck out to me I
don't think I needed at all truly but
I'm nervous about it because of the
white chocolate chip palette like I
promised you guys I'm not going to hold
the white chocolate chip solid against
to face for the rest of my life like I
promise you I'm mad I will purchase more
from Too Faced at some point but I'm
hesitant to purchase from them because
to me it seemed like too faced built up
their sweet peach launched so much did
you see the party that everyone went to
I mean they made like a freaking like
movie trailer for the sweet peach
palette they built that palette up so
much it did not make any sense to me why
they released the white chocolate chip
and the chocolate chip palace because
those were does palettes I mean I'm not
just saying that the majority of people
are saying that not everybody saying it
because some people did like them but
the majority of people are like what was
even the point of these pallets like
they were really really bad palette why
even released
when you were having such a huge
collection come out I didn't make any
sense to me it was just like a filler
product so I'm seriously worried that
this palette if you know it's another
smaller palette it was just another
filler palette for them are they coming
out you know with a new collection
that's going to be amazing and
incredible i know they have a big eye
shadow palette coming out they have
highlighters launching is that what
they're truly focused on and then
they're just coming out with another
filler pellet I don't know but after
that situation I'm just like not into it
I'm I'm really not into the makeup
companies right now what they're doing
putting out product after product after
product after product and most of them
being subpar that's not okay with me
like take your time and your energy and
your money and your focus and come out
with a bomb ass collection and don't
come out with these little little guys
that you're still charging us a lot of
money for and they're just poor quality
it doesn't make sense I'm just I'm upset
about it it's not just two faces doing
it a lot of companies are doing it I'm
like no I don't like the direction that
this is going guys I really don't so to
me I don't know what the quality of this
eyeshadow palettes going to be I don't
know if this is just another Philip
palette that to face is like oh here
take this and then we're going to come
out with something even better like I
don't know if that's what it's going to
be like but I'm just I'm too scared to
purchase from to face right now our
relationship is still too complicated
for me to go ahead and bite the bullet
so I'm not going to be purchasing the
peanut butter and honey palette honestly
it just it doesn't look like a palette
that I need anyways like the shades
aren't screaming asked me I'm not doing
any sort of double takes I feel like I
have some shades besides the yellow
shade which looks cool but I don't think
I need it regardless of everything else
that I just said in the rant but I just
went on I just don't I don't feel like I
need it in my collection either but I'd
love to know I know a lot of you guys
like to face I know Liza's you guys
support to face that's fantastic i love
it we're all very different let me know
are you guys can pick up this palette
are you excited for it so do you agree
with my thoughts about what make those
companies are doing and it's just like
getting really overwhelming that every
week they're coming out with something
new it's just craziness like it makes
you wonder when companies put out makeup
products that pack that fast like how
good or it can I actually be you know
what I'm saying like it's craziness but
I'd love to know your opinions down
below so I need some comments final
three products that I have to talk about
are most definitely have been the most
asked this week oh my gosh it's been
like crazy from you guys crazy in the
best way I love this thank you for
leaving in the comments thank you for
tagging me on instagram thank you for
the staff I appreciate it so much I had
no doubt in my mind what this video is
going to be on no doubt no doubt at all
the first one that I want to talk about
is a youtuber collab this is what I'm
safia Beverly Hills and Nicole Guerrero
they are coming out with a glow kid
together and yeah I lost I lost my ish I
lost it when I saw this we knew that
Nicole was doing a collab with anastacio
and I was so excited I would think an
eyeshadow palette I was super pumped and
then when they said hi light palette I
was like okay I'm ready I have to tell
you guys I've been saying in a lot of my
will i buy videos lately bad i'm kind of
like backing off the highlights and not
buying as much highlight I'm not wearing
as much highlight I deal with a lot of
texture when it comes to highlight what
you guys I'm pretty much back on the
highlight train and as our house is
because everybody and their mother and
their brother and their aunt is coming
out with highlights right now the
highlight game is insanity right now I
don't know what's happening everybody's
coming out with highlighters it's
insanity but i'm getting back into
highlighters I don't know if that has to
do with it but I feel like I've been
doing a really good job of my skincare
and getting that texture under control
and my texture is definitely clearing up
and getting better and so I've
definitely been wearing highlight a lot
more I truly don't think i'm pretty sure
every single day this week did I born
makeup I have worn highlight and like I
just want my highlight to be super
strong and super there so I think part
of it is also because the highlight
craze seems to like be taken up another
five notches but when I saw this I was
like I'm gonna get that there was like
no doubt in my mind and I did that thing
you guys i did it i looked at the
swatches I thought about it I thought
carefully through it do i need this will
I get a lot of use out of it is it's
going to be a smart purchase for me it's
forty dollars and you get six different
highlight shades and I think that's
awesome because the like original
Anastacio Lopez is 40
dollars for four shades and now you're
getting 44-6 I'm like yeah I was
thinking this is going to be more like
sixty dollars for 446 460 that's what I
thought it was going to be and so I'm
really excited because you're going to
be able to get it early access on the
Sephora app februari 26 and 27 so that
will already has been passed by the time
this video goes up but at the time i'm
filming that's tomorrow and I'm already
on it I'm on it my appt is ready to go I
already have a few other products and
I'm buying and there I already have my
samples in there everything is ready to
go so when that comes up tomorrow I'm
going to be ready add to my car and
check out I'm ready I'm good I'm like
I'm so ready for this and I'll freaking
pumped about it you guys I'm really
upset because I did not get the KC home
from Smashbox collab I woke up the
morning that it was released and it was
already pulled out I was like please
what happened what happened there they
are going to come back I was going to
order it from the Smashbox website just
because I wanted it early but they sold
out so now I'm just going to wait till
it comes on sephora i know it was
sometime in march i can leave it link in
the description box down below and also
if there's ever any questions sometimes
I film early i don't have prices or
dates or something usually by the time
the video goes up i have that
information and I leave it in the
description box below so make sure
you're checking their because a lot of
times people are putting in the comments
exactly what's in my description box and
I just feel bad that you guys are typing
all that when it's already in there so
make sure you check the description box
there's always good information in there
I'm always reading everybody's
description box but it seems like so
many people don't read those so make
sure you check that I don't even know
what I'm saying because I'm so freaking
excited can you see it like this one
I've lost my panties who knows are those
panties are so they are gone so excited
I have about this but I'm bummed because
i was saying i missed caseys collapse
i'm just going to wait till comes to
sephora and buy it through sephora so
i'm not sure when that's happening but
i'm going to go ahead and snag this
forty dollars six highlights they look
so freaking cool there's like this kind
of like blue frosty I see one mmm I'm
digging it first two in the top row
kitty cat and forever young I mean I
feel like those would look really good
with my skin tone I also feel like this
would be beautiful eyeshadows
like yes for sure I'm ready for it who
else is getting it I love Nicole bro
I've been watching her like she was
another one of the first ones that i
started watching i'm super excited to
support her ability she's just really
like I feel like she was really real
like she killed it to you honestly and I
appreciate that message my opinion we
all like different people so I totally
understand that everyone is going to
think that of course but for me I like
Nicole I like goddesses via I like the
glow kids I like highlights right now I
think forty dollars is a good price I
can get it early on the Sephora app I
can get points and samples oh my gosh
I'm so frickin excited I'm ready let me
know in the comments down below are you
going to get it or you can get early are
you going to get later let me know what
you think I want enough so the last one
that I'm going to talk about there was a
day last week where I wasn't find my
song for like two two and half hours I
know and my kept living wild I got back
on my phone to so many snapchats and so
many Instagram tags and I just thought
oh my gosh what could have possibly
happened I had no idea what to expect
that I was like clearly something has
happened and I started over didn't snap
and snap after snap after snap highly
highly highly highly Kylie highlight I
went on Instagram Kylie highly highly
highly I'm like oh dear okay so
everybody wants me to talk about the
highlighters that are coming out from
Kylie cosmetics Kylie cosmetics is
releasing her first highlight shades
right through her first highlight shade
yeah I'm pretty sure she is coming out
with banana split french vanilla cotton
candy cream salted caramel strawberry
short cake and chocolate cherry they are
coming on februari 28 so it'll be the
day before this video goes up at 3pm PST
ok so the packaging they come in like
individual square boxes i'll try to
insert the best pictures that i Ken down
here they have like the dripping effect
like the Kylie cosmetics in there I love
the names of um strawberry shortcake
chocolate cherry love it they look to be
a lot of different shades good you know
they have some for the lighter skin
tones the darker skin tones golds and
silvers and all that good stuff but no
no I'm not buying these I'm sorry with
so many different highlighters that are
coming out right now I
truly have no interest in buying Kylie's
i would rather support kokoro I'd rather
support katie holmes i would rather
support indie brands that are coming out
with highlighters like that's that's
where my main focuses when I saw that
Kylie was coming out with highlighters I
got no excitement to be honest with you
I was just like huh okay I don't dislike
Kylie Jenner I don't dislike Kylie
cosmetics i purchased from kyle a
cosmetics and i think it's fine I think
she's doing better like in my opinion
things are getting better from when she
first started which you hope so I know
that she's been offering like free
shipping i don't know if that's like a
forever thing but I know she's got like
free shipping deals going on now we're
like I made my first purchase from her
way back in the day and I was like ten
dollars sociable lipstick and I was like
no so I know that that's being improved
but she's another one who is coming out
with so many collections so many
products that I just kind of like wonder
about the quality of all of them a lot
of things seem to be very inconsistent
like I've gotten liquid lipsticks my
first liquid lipstick from her amazing
what I feel beautiful love it x is
another liquid lipstick remember not
good nothing like the other quality it
just says like engine very inconsistent
and I mean I know that that's going to
be kind of like impossible to get around
you know brands have hit or miss
products but it just seems to be like
I'm so far of the spectrums with Kylie
cosmetic so it's just very confusing and
just makes me a little bit nervous but
also just because I know that I'm
purchasing the Nicole highlight and then
I want to purchase when Katie Holmes
with highlight gets into sephora I don't
need this money highlights do I need
both of those highlights house no I
simply I'm not lying to you i don't
think both of them but i want both of
them and i can justify it to myself cuz
I'm like I'm wearing highlight again I
need to celebrate and out of all of them
I'd rather support the youtubers and i
really like I'm sadia I love Smashbox so
that's how I'm going to support we don't
have a price on them yet so I don't know
what the prices usually the price comes
out with the day before they launch so I
don't have that yet but I can leave it
with in the description box down below
as I'm filling out that but no matter
what the price is I just don't have any
interest in it too many brands right now
are coming out with highlights like
truly too many brands are coming out
highlight for being a highlight
factories it right now but it's making
me pick and choose which brands which
collabs with shades which prices that I
want to purchase from and kylie is way
far down on that list so I'm not going
to get any of the highlighters of myself
but I'd love to know are you guys super
stoked do you love Kylie cosmetics you
purchase like everything that she's
coming out with what do you think about
the Chi lighters what shades are you
going to get let us know in the comments
