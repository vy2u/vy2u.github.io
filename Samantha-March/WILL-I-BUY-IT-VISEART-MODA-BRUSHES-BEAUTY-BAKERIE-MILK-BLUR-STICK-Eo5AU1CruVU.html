today's video is going to be a new will
it buy it video I do my will i buy it
videos every single Wednesday so I will
leave my playlist link down below in
case you're interested in checking out
my pastoral i buy a video I started this
series as a way to be able to talk about
new makeup releases if i'm going to buy
them if i'm not going to buy them and a
little bit about them and then also just
talk to you guys and see what you guys
are buying what you're spending your
money on etc so i do post videos four
times a week wednesday are my will i buy
it videos and then i also post on
thursdays sundays and mondays so i hope
that you will hit the subscribe button
if you like to be notified for future
videos you can even hit the cell to all
kinds of fun things to become a part of
the fam but as always with my will i buy
videos I had a lot to talk about so when
am I go ahead and get started I'm always
reading the comments that you guys are
leaving me here on these videos and then
I get tagged along on Instagram as well
for things that you want me to talk
about and a lot of people were tagging
me on a post about the new visor pallets
I'm not sure if adviser are busier but I
feel like I hear most people say advisor
so I'm going to say sighs arts so I'm
looking at the trend mood one Instagram
page and also I don't know if you guys
like alerted trend mood that I was
talking about her palette in one of my
past will i buy it video so she actually
reached out to me on instagram in my
direct message and said like thank you
for talking about the palette and I'm so
excited for its release and all this
stuff and I was like what so that was
really cool that she watched him a video
so i don't know i'm going to thank you
guys because I feel like you guys really
helps get my name out there share my
video so thank you that was so cool when
I saw her name comes through I was like
wait a second what what's what's what's
happening so so it's crazy so thank you
so much so the new visor palette so they
have the eyeshadow palette vpe 10 which
includes 12 warm matte shades and it is
eighty dollars and then I also came out
with the eyeshadow palette petite pro
which is thirty dollars i will put both
the pellets down below so you can see
them now I was just on the Sephora
website looking for them and I could
only find the petite pro palette on
there I couldn't find the other one so
i'm not sure it says that they were both
on sale so i'm not sure why
come find a sephora if it's already sold
out but i'll look a little bit further
to link it down below so i've been asked
a lot about the visor palettes and if i
have them and what I think of them and
if I'd recommend them I don't have any
of them simply because the price they
are super expensive like the eighty
dollar palette I think that's a pretty
standard cost for the visor palace and
that's just too much money for me to
spend on an eyeshadow palette I say it a
lot I'm not I shows how a junkie I feel
like I say is in every single will i buy
it video and I still do my eyeshadow
palettes I feel like when I by an
eyeshadow palette people come after me
like you don't buy eyeshadow palettes
that's totally not what I'm saying I
just don't feel the need to buy every
single I shot out like some people want
all of the eyeshadow palettes and I just
don't even have that urge like not
saying everybody buys every single
eyeshadow palette but like they want to
I don't want to like it's just not
calling out to me I think these colors
in here are beautiful like I don't know
the the bigger one the eighty dollar one
and I just it looks fine but it's not
something that I'm going to go run out
and spend eighty dollars arms like
that's just too much money for me for
makeup the other one the petite pro
actually I think looks really pretty it
looks like there are four matte shades
and then for shimmer shades the shimmer
shades look beautiful the math actually
look really pretty so thirty dollars I
don't know that might actually be
something to consider because thirty
dollars isn't that bad and I would be
able to be trying out the dysart formula
and seeing you know do I think it's
worth it to buy the bigger palette so
that actually I don't know I was upset
I'm saying no and now i'm looking at
that pilot like oh that's really pretty
like that gold really pretty up things
really pretty those matte colors look
really nice the only one that i'm not
sure about is the white one because i
don't use white a whole time but i don't
know i'm gonna i'm gonna go with my gut
and say no I'm going to go ahead and say
no if I were to buy between the two new
palettes that are out i would definitely
buy the smaller one try out the formula
see how i like it thirty dollars and
don't feel like would be bad for that
palette but i'm going to go ahead and
say no for right now i don't think it
would be a good purchase for me
personally but but they definitely do
look very pretty let me know what you
think in the comments down below if you
have any
from visor you have need advise our
palates order your favorites do you
think it is worth the high price tag let
us know in the comments down below so
I've done a lot of questions about these
new makeup brushes that are coming out
they are the royal and langnickel motor
brushes and they are available at
Walmart I'm looking at new a little
cheap I think it's how you pronounce the
website so it says new from royal and
langnickel very fun 2017 products coming
to walmart stores and it features the
new moda phase perfecting set so that
retails for 1684 and contains 4 oval
brushes so it looks like they have a
large oval brush designed for all over
creamer liquid foundation there's a
brush for blush or bronzer there's a
brush to flawlessly blend contour on
your cheek bones along jawline out your
hairline and then there is one for
precisely applying concealer blending
makeup on your eyes or for contouring
nose or other small areas of your
footage so you're getting four brushes
for like the oval tip of russia's for
about seventeen dollars and again these
are available at Walmart I'll leave i'm
right down below it does it ever so
sweet on walmart com as well so if i can
find them i'll leave them went down
below I don't necessarily really shop at
Walmart so I haven't seen them at my
walmart store simply because I haven't
been to a walmart in a very long time so
I don't get I was getting a lot of
questions about these and I think it's
because of the way that they look with
their very eye-catching type of brushes
but I was really struggling to find
information about them it's just me a
long time to find anything and I just
really not a lot of people were talking
about him yet so I was really struggling
to figure out what it is even where
where they were what the cost was you
know what's the big deal about them is
etc so um I don't know so i know that
oval brushes are getting you know pretty
popular and a lot of different brands
are coming out with them pure cosmetics
recently released a new foundation and
they came out with their own foundation
brush they did actually send it to me so
I've been able to try out their brush
but it's like the oval brush I have some
old brushes from my makeup brush set I
recently was sent the oh wow brush from
kalyan and cosmetic
I believe it is via actally and that's
kind of more on the oval brush type of
trends the brushes to me the whole
brushes are very like hit or miss and I
find them that I either really really
like them or I really really don't like
them so i don't know i think i'm going
to pass on these for now mostly just
because it says that you can only find
them at walmart so far and i just don't
really shop there so i was passover that
for that reason but i don't know if they
look cool but i don't know i don't find
myself reaching for the older brushes a
ton unless i absolutely really like them
i actually will have an oval brush
featured in my februari favorite video
so watch out for that one but that one
it's like one that i truly love and
that's really the only time reaching for
an oval brush otherwise I think my
Beauty Blender works fine and I think my
regular makeup brushes work fine so i
just don't think i would get as much use
out of them and then the i find myself
only really liking kind of the bigger
ones they're really only like him for
foundation or concealer so like these
little tiny ones too like contour and
stuff i would rather use my brushes and
my own technique so i just don't think i
would use them you know maybe if i could
buy like not the biggest one but the
second biggest ones i could buy that one
separately maybe i was buying and trade
out but i just don't think I need a
whole set of them i don't think i would
utilize them enough so i don't think it
would be a smart purchase for me but let
us know in the comments down below what
have you been hearing about this product
have you already picked him up what do
you think about it have you tried from
motor brushes before I just this is one
that I wasn't really familiar with
myself but I wanted to include it in
here because I like to get your guys's
feedback I there's one video where I
talked about color drain and I was like
I've never really heard of coloring what
do you guys think and I was overwhelmed
with comment about how good color green
is so I love giving your guys's feedback
thank you so much as always for that but
you let us know in the comments down
below what you think okay so the next
product that I want to talk about is a
brand that I've been getting asked if
I've ever tried anything from the brand
and if i'd recommend the brand and i've
never tried out this brand and i think
i'm super curious i really want to the
brands that i'm talking about is beauty
bakery and i'm going to focus this will
i buy it on their eye shadow palette so
that I shall appel
that is called the Neapolitan ice cream
palette so definitely when I saw it it
reminded me right away I've left a dose
of colors ice cream pellet I think that
is what it was called so when I saw the
Neapolitan ice cream palette I was like
okay I can what's going on here it is a
$38 palette and can I pull the photo at
the inside of it looks like it has 12
different shades I can't tell from that
photo oh here we go here's the
description these sugary powder
eyeshadow shades come in seven shimmers
and five masks for perfect coastal
operations called all year long the
shadows and pellet perfect we're alone
are layered and combined with our cream
baked eyeshadow cream shadow collection
or sprinkles ok so it's thirty-eight
dollars for the ice cream palette and
you get the 12 different shades
accommodation of meds and shimmers okay
so when I was starting to you asked
about beauty bakery I actually had heard
of them yet so then I looked him up I
immediately found this ice cream palette
and it looks like it was on sale and
then maybe it was out of stock and now
it's come back so at the time that i'm
filming it is back in stock but they're
saying like hurry before it goes back
out of stock so i'll leave a link down
below hopefully just they'll be in fact
by the time i get this video up this
brand their packaging have my heart like
it screams me their illuminators and
that packaging some of the eyeshadows in
their packaging i am just like dying
over this brand i have to try them i'm
not sure about the actual eye shadow
palette because it sounds like it's
about to go out of stocks and i'm
wondering maybe they'll have a new eye
shadow palette coming up soon but
regardless it looks like they have a lot
understand their website right now they
have a couple of collabs some people out
there as well and then i also saw as i
can get to their Instagram I saw that
they are doing an upcoming collab with
gabby douglas it's lit beauty bakery in
olympic superstar Gabby Douglas are
collaborating on something good so I'm
like okay I might wait and see what's
this collab is all about and then that
maybe I will think about that but
seriously their packaging looks so cool
it looks so yummy i'm such an ice cream
fanatic but what beauty bakeries their
whole line just
so delicious I'll leave their website a
link down below but I also wanted to ask
you guys have you tried anything from
Beauty bakery is there anything that you
think is like an absolutely must have
that I get is it something that's been
on your radar but you haven't got
anything yet let me know in the comments
down below so like I said I'm going to
pass over the eyeshadow palette for now
because it looks like it's about to go
out of stock and then I think I'm just
going to keep my eye and see what they
are collaborating with gabby douglas on
and it maybe that's something i could
think about for the future but Beauty
bakery definitely looks like a delicious
brand yes that's great a delicious brand
alas I do I have to talk about is an
item that I feel like it's getting a lot
of hype lately so a lot of people are
asking if I've already gotten this
product I'll fright am going to pick it
up it's from milk makeup and it is their
allure stick so I'm just on the sephora
website looks like it is thirty-six
dollars it says the colorless oil and
silicone free primer to blur the look of
imperfections on all skin tones alright
so I've been seeing a lot of the videos
around I know like kathleenlights made a
video on it and that I've been watching
a lot of other videos and seeing what
people are saying on it and kind of the
consensus is that people really do think
that it works and that it is a good
product so that has definitely sparked
my curiosity about it I don't think I've
tried anything yet from milk makeup they
came out with like a holographic
highlighter a while back I don't even
know if I put it in a lil i buy a video
I can't think of it up the top of my
head but people are saying that was kind
of more gimmicky so then when I saw this
blur stick kamata Michaels was just like
kind of like a gimmick you have a
product as well but people are saying
that it really does work and then it
really does wear out their face and what
people are saying is that I get
specially traveling Liza she was doing
it just like it doesn't feel like you're
doing anything to your skin so it's
really bizarre like am I even putting it
on so I'm like I don't know like now my
curiosity is definitely sparked on this
one but it's thirty-six dollars for
essentially a face primer and I'm like
can i send thirty-six dollars on a
primer like I wouldn't want to spend
thirty-six dollars on a foundation like
that's a lot of money to me for a
foundation but for a primer like
that just seems too expensive even
though people are saying that they think
it work from they think it's a cool
product I'm like I don't I heard a
little because like I want to I was like
I would love to try it out I would love
to get it they had um easy there like a
sample maybe a camera it was a deluxe
sample on the floor website or it was
like one of their weekly specials but
you could get like a tester of it which
I have no idea how that was going to
work like how much product was it
actually going to be like it was just
going to be like in like one of those
little paper things where you have to
like try really hard to rub the product
down to put it on your face because I
can't imagine they'd send out a little
too doesn't mini but I don't know I
thought on there and I was like okay I'm
just going to get that and try it and
then when I ended up quitting right
before our order is gone so I was like
what I remind that didn't work so I
don't know I truly was I once I break it
down and I actually think about it i'm
going to send thirty-six dollars on a
primer not a huge primer person has a
time I forget to wear my primer I just
feel like it would be a product that I
used a couple times and I would forget
about or maybe I wouldn't like it and
then it's going to be thirty-six dollars
wasted so I don't think that I can do it
what do you guys think do you already
have it do you think of those worth it
do you use it a lot I don't know I would
really like to try out milk make up more
and more people are talking about them
lately and they're coming out with some
really cool stuff but it's hard for me
to justify thirty-six dollars on a
primer that's just I think that's just a
little bit too much money for me to
spend on a primer I know primers are
important I like to wear primers like
when I remember to wear them I'm happy
with them but it's just not something
like when I'm just doing makeup at home
and i'm just going to film a video and
then 40 minutes later I'm gonna wash my
makeup off I don't honestly bother to
apply primer because why like I feel
like it's just a waste product and I'm
not really someone who goes out every
single night and has a full face of
makeup every single night like when I'm
going out and doing something yes I
where primer but majority of the time
i'm putting makeup on just to some
videos so i just don't think i would
utilize it enough so i'm trying to talk
myself out of it can you tell the guy i
am actually trying to talk myself out of
buying this
but let's not my comments down below if
you have it do you recommend it do you
love it or would you suggest testing on
it I would love to know what you guys
