today's video is going to be a new way I
buy it I post my videos every single
Wednesday where I'm chatting over at
some new makeup releases and launches
and talking a little bit about them and
also deciding if I'm going it's pick
them up or pass over them as always we
have a lot to chat about this week so
why don't we go ahead and get started
okay I got quite a few tags on some new
releases from hourglass cosmetics which
I thought was fun I don't have a ton
from hourglass I have the vanish stick
foundation and then also I think just a
blush is all I have from them but they
are coming out with some new products so
they have the veil translucent setting
powder also the veil powder brush and
the veil retouching fluid
says it's going to be available April
24th I don't see prices on any of this
I'm just looking at the trend would one
Instagram so I'll have her a list in my
description box as I usually do so I
don't have prices on anything but
hourglass is typically pretty darn pricy
so I'm just gonna go ahead and assume
that these are gonna be pretty pricy
products so to talk about a setting
powder
I am instantly like I don't feel like I
need this I have a lot of setting
powders I just got a couple new ones
including some cult faves the RCA vine
of color powder finally I got the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and so I just
don't feel like I need any new setting
powders in my life they're also not
something I use a ton of I prefer kind
of more of a pressed powder these days
so instantly when I see setting powder
I'm just kind of like meh it does say
it's an ultra refined loose powder
designed to set makeup and give skin a
naturally a flawless finish sounds
beautiful but I probably don't need it
and then they have this powder brush
which is a dual ended design it is set
under the eye and then all over the face
I like the concept of that because I I
mean these are brushes that I use I
utilize in my collection I'm just not a
fan of double-ended brushes because
they're harder to store I feel like a
lot of times that's what you hear people
say when you talk about double-ended
brushes I think I maybe only have two in
my collection and it's because whenever
I store them I have to have the bristles
down on one of the ends I mean that's
that's how it is so I just don't
gravitate towards the double-ended
brushes
again I like the concept of it but with
how I store my makeup brushes right now
I don't really have anything in place
for double and the brushes and I really
I don't need a new brush as well now the
veil retouching fluid sounds interesting
it says an innovative serum a formula
that instantly illuminates is to refresh
revive retouch and has hyaluronic acid
says it comes available in six shades
which I find to be interesting as well
so this is one that I'm not like a
hundred percent sure what it is that
we're doing here because it says that
you can put it on any part of the face
you can put it on the under eye it says
it's a sheer coverage but then you know
then it has like the different shades in
there as well so this one I'm kind of
like I'm not a hundred percent sure on
what this is but it's also probably
something that I don't necessarily need
like if it's more skincare based I have
plenty of serums my skincare collection
is a-ok
picked up a few new things anyways maybe
you said oh look if I say and then if
it's more makeup style it's probably
just something that I wouldn't utilize a
lot like it's not something that I feel
like I'm missing in my collection but I
mean I'll be curious to hear what people
say I think out of all three I'm most
curious about this and it's probably
just because I don't fully like I'm not
fully grasping what it is quite yet so
I'll be excited to see people review it
and such but you know kind of just right
off the bat I don't feel like I need
anything from this new collection I
think a lot of people are pretty excited
to see a new release affirm that makeup
the cosmetics and myself included so it
says they are coming out with a new
eyeshadow collection the power pigments
they will be sold individually includes
ten different shades of how photos
insert here of course and it just says
it'll be available May 3rd on the
website they're highly pigmented pressed
pigments okay that you can use on eyes
lips or face I don't see a price on
these individually yet just that they
will be available on May 3rd so I'm not
sure I think make a peak kind of started
out like when I first started buying
from makeup geek they were more
affordable and then they kind of like up
to their prices after a bit so they were
kind of like mid-range I would say so
I'm not sure
you know if I have that information
about the time this comes out I'll have
it in the description box of course but
I'm very curious about these I
definitely do want to see the price on
them just so just so I know but I'm just
excited to see something new from makeup
geek makeup geek was kind of like under
the radar for a while and I believe they
are coming to Ulta I think it is we've
seen some sneak peeks that they're gonna
be coming to a store and in the photo it
looked like it was going to be an Ulta
which is super exciting I mean I've been
buying from this brand before I even had
a YouTube channel this this makeup geek
used to be talked about all of the time
across YouTube channels so I'm excited
to see them coming out the new release I
mean these are all really bold beautiful
colors yellow orange red pink purple
green blue I mean that's really exciting
too I know a lot of people feel like we
get a lot of the same eyeshadow palettes
and neutrals and beiges and browns and
things like that so even though this
isn't necessarily a palette it's just
the individual pressed pigment I mean it
could be cool for people who want to add
that pop of color like me without buying
an entire colorful palette because it's
not something that I use a ton of
because I do more neutral looks such as
today I am kind of curious about this
one but at the same time I'm also I'm
also curious to see how these work
because highly pigmented pressed
pigments it kind of like reminds me of
subculture because isn't that kind of
like what subculture like what people
were saying that was they were just very
like pigmented pressed pigments
basically a subculture and I got along
okay with that palette but I mean it's
definitely you gotta use a different
technique like a different style when
you are using that palette so I'll be
curious I think this is another one as
well that AI would like to get the price
but B I would like people to use it and
like show me show me how it's working
show me how it's going on before I make
my decision but I think that it looks
really cool I'm some of these purples of
the year I've really caught my attention
and there's pretty green as well so this
is one where I just want to see some
reviews but I'd like to know where you
guys immediately interested in this are
you just excited to see makeup geek come
out with something new cuz I share him
Bridey I got some tags on this new
release from BH Cosmetics this is the
unit
love the BH Cosmetics and Marvin
magnificent palette I'm not sure I'm
saying that correctly the Marva corn
palette I believe this is what it's
saying oh my goodness
it has 10 i shadow us both in matte
shimmers and three highlights it's 1750
and available now on BHS website and
then also online at Ulta beauty
okay so this is a collaboration with
Marvin magnificent who I believe is a
youtuber I'm not super familiar with the
collaboration which doesn't necessarily
like deter me from purchasing items um
if it's someone that I know and like I
watched a lot in like wanna support
sometimes I'll be more encouraged to buy
the collab but just because I'm not
familiar with someone that doesn't mean
that's the only reason why I'm not gonna
purchase something but I know the
unicorns that are not stopping they're
not stopping at any point and I mean it
must be just it it must be working
because otherwise I don't know why the
brand's keep coming out with the
unicorns and the mermaids that's like
what we're just getting a ton of and I
feel like I watched so many videos where
people are like okay we're done like we
went through that that was a trend for a
while and now it's over and let's move
on but they still just keep coming out
so I mean they must be selling well or
doing something or getting feedback from
somewhere that people keep wanting this
because they're just gonna keep coming
out with it so I can't say that I'm
interested in this palette I mean it
looks it looks pretty the packaging is
like cute but not necessarily my
personal vibes you know I like that
there's matte and shimmers in there and
then you get the highlights in there
that's cool I like kind of those double
pilots like the Carly and the BH
palettes with the eye shadows and the
highlights as well but it's just not my
personal taste I just when I saw this
kind of my first reaction was it's still
happening still happening quite a few
types on this new release from a sleek
cosmetics it's a new highlight palette
with a copper vibe it's called the
copper plate and that's for different
highlight shades don't see a price or a
release date on this I just
some swatches on here but it looks
really pretty looks like it has a mirror
which is nice comes with a brush which I
probably won't use I have these sleek
solstice palette and I am so impressed
with that guy
what was it is it like sixteen dollars I
want to say for that palette and it's
very very impressive for a more
affordable high light palette the shades
in there are super super blinding and
very easy to apply they look so good on
the skin so when I saw that sleek was
coming off the new highlight palette I
was a minute they're like interesting
now it says that it's more it has these
copper vibes and it looks like from the
swatches that I see it looks like
they're gonna be a little bit darker of
highlights so I'm not sure that this is
going to work great for my particular
skin tone but that's okay because I mean
that's that just says what it is and I
feel like the Solstice palette is kind
of maybe geared towards people with a
lighter skin tone so I think it's cool
that they're gonna come out with this
one too so I mean maybe I would just
have to actually see it on people cuz
again I'm just looking at the swatches
but they look to be pretty dark but I'm
think it's really cool I think it looks
really pretty and I mean I haven't tried
this one of course I don't even have the
release date on it but if it's anything
like the Solstice palette I think it
would be a pretty good purchase I got a
whole bunch of tags on this
collaboration between Smashbox and of
lava
MUA oh boy okay so they have a full
collection that is available now it's
the pedal metal collection it includes
oh it's on a pedal matte liquid
lipsticks for $24 each there's also the
be legendary a pedal metal liquid lip
for $24 okay
and then we have the pedal metal shimmer
drops for $32 we have cover shot the
pedal metal eyeshadow palette for $29
the pedal metal highlighters are $39
each I think that's what most people are
pretty darn excited for and then we have
primers for $39 a shimmer spray for $39
a liquid liner for $24 so it is going to
be available April 13th officially on
the smashbox website and also beauty and
then april 17th of sephora preview
exclusive highlighter shade kate april
22nd in Ulta stores April 23rd in all
stores so I will have a similar
down below okay so lotta MUA I believe
she became a pretty popular like
well-known for her lip drip photos and
type of thing which are super super cool
so I I knew her name right away and like
her photos and stuff I've definitely
seen them so that's very cool and a huge
congratulations on such a large
collection collaboration with Smashbox
that's super awesome so I will say that
I'm not gonna purchase anything from the
collection I know a lot of people are
really excited over the highlights
because they look absolutely beautiful
and justice I mean the packaging on them
is a super super cool but the highlights
are $39 each and that's gonna that's
that's really pricey that's gonna be a
little bit too much for me for a single
highlight that's just a lot a few other
things that kind of like poked out at me
and the the cover shot eyes shadow
palette I've tried two or three of the
Smashbox coverage of eyeshadow palettes
and they just did not impress me and
then when it comes to a couple of the
other items like the shimmer spray
liquid liners primers things like that
like I'm just not super interested or
like needing those in my collection but
I think definitely what had people the
most curious and was asking me about the
most was those highlighters and I think
that I mean I think that you're paying
for the collaboration name and I
definitely think you're paying for that
packaging but it's still $39 it's gonna
be too high for me but I think it's just
gonna be too much for me they look
really cool and it definitely gave me a
double take but I I don't need a new
highlighter right now and I definitely
don't need a $39 highlight so it was
kind of easy for me to actually talk
myself out of it but I know a lot of
people are so excited over this
collaboration but it just wasn't
something that spoke to me enough to be
able to spend that kind of money on it
and also keep in mind this is the
wilayat video that I'm filming after the
Sephora vib sale so you know I got I got
a lot of shopping done I'm still waiting
on my packages so I can fill my home
video but I feel like I'm kind of in
that moment where I'm like I just bought
a lot of stuff and I'm excited to play
with it and use it try it out and review
it so I feel like will I buy a video so
they come after a sale like this I'm
just kind of like nothing it just unless
something is like really really speaking
to me I'm pretty good at being able
say like no girl like you got stuff to
play with just just be happy with that
speaking of some highlights though Black
Moon &amp;amp; Cosmetics is coming out with new
highlighters or moonlighters and these
are inspired by a bioluminescent species
there are $22 each so we have dragon
fish and centipede glow worm I'm jelly
fish squid some very interesting names
in here they'll be available April 13th
so Black Moon cosmetics I got the orb of
light eyeshadow palette and I've been
trying that out I have a another I'm
indie brain reviews coming up and I'll
be be reviewing that eyeshadow palette
in there but again this is another one
with highlights that I'm like I just
don't feel like I need one right now and
again I'm just I'm I'm gonna go ahead
and blend the vib sale again like unless
something is really pulling at me I'm
gonna be pretty good and saying that I
don't need to purchase it right now so a
lot of these kind of look they look like
highlights that I don't typically reach
for though there's some blue and purple
and even like a green highlight it's
just not something that I wear a ton of
so to spend $22 on it it doesn't you
know probably wouldn't be the best idea
for me so I know that I can go ahead and
skip over the new highlights from Black
Moon at cosmetics but I'm sure there are
people out there that are gonna get one
so let me know if that is you moving on
I have a new item here from Tasha Oh
Tasha this is the pearl tinted eye
illuminating treatment so it says that
it's a tinted treatment to awaken eyes
with a pearl like a luster it's supposed
to hydrate and reduce the look of dark
circles and wrinkles instantly over time
okay so it's gonna be $48 and it comes
in different shades they're soft like
candlelight and moonlight so that's
pretty interesting $48 I guess I don't
feel like that's like the most terrible
price in the world for this tacha
product and the packaging looks really
cool but this is something that I don't
feel like I need because I feel like I
have others like this in my collection I
use the color science the three-in-one
eye treatment I use it I'm pretty much
every single day use it this morning
and to me it sounds really similar to
that like the color science one has kind
of like a peachy vibe so it kind of
hides the dark circles and then stuff
I've been improving my eyes over time so
that's just kind of what I'm using right
now in regular basis so just one of
those things where I feel like I don't
need to get it ever take towards tatcha
a ton because they are pretty
high-priced and I guess when I saw this
I really thought it was gonna be even
more I mean $48 $48 don't get me wrong
but I was thinking it would be like
white much more expensive so I don't
know if this is something that gets your
attention but for me I just don't think
I need it and I have other products like
it right now I did get quite a few tags
on a new eyeshadow palette from L'Oreal
so they are coming out with the cherry
palette of the cherry my Cherie am I
saying that right so it says it has a 16
of warm shades it's a Creedy creamy
powder formula for ultra soft
application boost it pigments for a
juicy color payoff it just says that it
is coming soon I don't see a price on
this one either it looks like they're
coming out with a new blush as well but
I was just seeing tags on the eyeshadow
palette it's called the mega palette
okay for 16 shades all right Dario you
get that mega palette this is another
one that I just I don't feel like I
really had any interest in it when I saw
it I just I didn't do double take I
didn't seem to get very excited about it
I was just kind of like okay I'm trying
out a bunch of new drugstore products
right now I have a drugstore review
video coming up but I will say that I
feel like the eyeshadows that I've been
trying have been kind of lacking for me
so I don't know that's kind of what I
feel when I look at this one from
L'Oreal which I feel like sounds really
bad but I've tried a lot of drugstore
eyeshadow palettes and there's just I
just tend not to enjoy them as much as I
do some of the higher priced eyeshadow
palettes so again I don't see a price on
this one so I'm not a hundred percent
what it would be but I mean hopefully
L'Oreal drugstore would be a little bit
more affordable but I feel like I have
all of those colors and nothing really
like inspired me when I saw and was like
I absolutely have to have this palette
so that one was pretty easy for me it's
his skip over Urban Decay is coming out
with another new product I feel like
urban decay is really coming out with
quite a bit lately they're coming out
with a new palette it's called the light
beam and includes a five shades again it
just says no price on it no release date
on it so I'm sure
to include more products and every
single will I buy a video and so even if
I don't know all of the information yet
I can kind of give my thoughts on it
that's what I'm trying to do here like
late but I will say what this one so I'm
a big fan of Urban Decay one of my
favorite brands a lot of their releases
excite me in the back talk excited me
their beached pallet has me excited but
this is one when I looked at it I again
just didn't get any feels and I mean I
don't I don't know if it's maybe it's
cuz it's five shades and I just kind of
don't know like what kind of looks I
would necessarily put together with
these five shades I'm not sure but this
was one where I was kind of like meh and
that's I mean and that's okay because
like I said with urban decay being one
of my favorite brands I like to purchase
a lot from them and try out a lot from
them so when I see something that
doesn't necessarily fill up my boat I'm
like that's okay because I can't buy
everything I can't try everything it's
not possible so this is one that just
didn't get my attention it just I don't
know I don't want to say boring because
I don't like when people say boring when
it comes to makeup because everyone's
makeup preferences are so different then
I cannot like sometimes I get offended
when people are like that
pehle it is neutral and boring because
I'm like well I'm neutral and boring so
I don't know what's tell you there but
it just doesn't excite me enough for an
Urban Decay palette but that's okay but
if that one that one I'm not too
interested in so coverfx is coming out
with the gold bar highlighting palette
it has three different shades and it's
$39 says will be available April 8 on
their website and outs of beauty and in
stores April 22nd now this is one that
did catch my attention when I thought I
was like that I like how it looks really
pretty so they have a gold shade more of
a white gold shade and then rose gold
that's it's more pinky to me than rose
gold but it looks really beautiful the
highlight palette itself looks nice that
highlights swatches that I'm seeing it
looks really nice $39 for three I don't
think that's that bad especially when
you know I'm just talking about Smashbox
and Vlada that's $39 for just one shade
I mean this was one that that definitely
caught my attention I'm gonna try to
stay strong though because again like I
said I don't really need new highlights
right now I don't really feel like I
need a new
highlight palette and I just bought a
bunch of products so from the vib sale
so I'm like so euro girlfriend I don't
think that you need that but I will say
that I think it looks really beautiful I
only have one cover FX highlight it's in
moonlight I believe it is and it's just
a little mini I got as a Christmas gift
from my sister-in-law I sent her my
support love solicitous elf hello and I
like it but I don't absolutely love it
but I feel like I've heard really good
things about other cover FX highlight
palettes so I don't know I don't know if
maybe the palettes are better I'm not
sure but I mean it's still a nice
highlight but it's nothing that like had
me super pumped like I reach for it all
the time type of thing it's just nice
but this one was looking pretty but I
think I'm gonna be able to stay strong
and stay you know talking myself out of
it who else have this cover FX highlight
palette catch their attention are you
guys gonna order it if you do let me
know what you think of it but even
though I think it's really beautiful I
think I'm gonna stay strong and say no
all right guys that's gonna be
everything for this week so will I buy a
video I hope that you found this video
entertaining or helpful in some way as
always let me know what you thought
about all of the products that I
mentioned what has your attention what
are you passing over and are you kind of
feeling like me if you've already made a
purchase or the vib sale and you're just
