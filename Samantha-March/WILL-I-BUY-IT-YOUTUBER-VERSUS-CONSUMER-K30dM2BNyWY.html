today's video is going to be a new will
I buy it I post my bill I buy it every
single Wednesday where I'm talking about
a new makeup releases and lunches
letting you know a little bit about them
and then letting you know if I'm going
to be purchasing them or passing over
them
today's will I buy it it's going to have
a little twist on it though I have been
doing a weekly will I buy it for several
several months now I came up with the
will I buy it back
last winter I want to say and I turned
it into a weekly series a couple months
ago as well but today I wanted to do a
little twist on the usual will I buy it
so I'm going to be calling this one will
I buy it
youtuber vs. consumer so I'm going to be
talking about items and letting you know
if I would buy this as a youtuber or if
I would buy them as a consumer so not
only am I going to be talking about some
new items like I would in a regular will
I buy a video but I'm also going to
touch on a few path items that were more
popular in some of my past will I buy
eight videos and let you know what I buy
them as a youtuber or would I buy them
as a consumer because honestly I feel
like there is a pretty big difference I
can definitely tell there are items that
I bought because I am a youtuber not
like a YouTube made me buy a type of
video but because I'm a youtuber I'm
buying it for it my channel I'm buying
it to review I'm buying it because my
followers and subscribers asked me to
pick it up and review it and swatch it
and all that so those are would be doing
today I hope you guys like a little
twist on the usual will I buy it so next
week we'll get back into it the more
regular well advice but I thought I
could throw a little curveball at you
here this week before we get started I
do want to say thank you so much for
clicking on this video I do post videos
every single day so if you enjoy daily
content on makeup and beauty I hope that
you will consider hitting the subscribe
button I also have 20k giveaways going
on right now for YouTube and Instagram
so those are linked down below and I
will also link my will I buy it
playlist if you want to see any of my
past will I buy it but if you would like
to see my will I buy it a youtuber
versus consumer why don't we go ahead
and get started so one item that I want
to talk about that I have mentioned in
the past and I've mentioned in many
videos is the Natasha Nonna sunset
palette that this palette is so hyped so
many people have lost their minds over
this palette I do not have it in my
possession
yes but I am planning on buying it and I
would definitely say that I am buying it
as a youtuber versus a consumer this
palette is a hundred and twenty nine
dollars so like I can confidently say as
a consumer I would not purchase an
eyeshadow palette at a hundred and
twenty nine dollars that is a lot of
money even though I am a makeup lover
and a makeup addict a big reason why I
started a beauty youtube channel is to
almost kind of justify my passion for
makeup and how much I buy it because I'm
like oh it's for my channel it's for my
channel is for review I wouldn't have to
be able to spend that much money on a
palette as a consumer I'm not saying
that you shouldn't if you don't have a
channel that you can't buy 120 eyeshadow
palette that is totally not what I'm
saying this video because you get to do
what you want to do with your money but
I do know as a consumer I just I would
not be able to do it when I do buy this
palette which I'm planning on doing a
beauty lush haul in the future which I'm
very excited for I'm planning on
hopefully getting this palette on a
beauty lush website if it isn't stock I
know it goes out of stock a lot but I
feel like I can confidently say that I
am buying this pellet as a youtuber on
buying it for my channel on buying it
for reviews for comparison videos for
swatch videos of course your like
tutorials and things like that wise up
I'm definitely buying the Natasha did
notice on sub palettes as a youtuber a
new item that I want to talk about for
this will I buy it is from wet and wild
they are coming out with new mega glow
highlighting powder these are going to
be $4.99 for a powder highlight I know
some is he past wet and wild highlights
have really blown up there was a lot of
hype over some of the highlights and
then they were like super hard to find
and no one could get them I remember
going to my CVS and Walgreens and I
couldn't find them and I just gave up so
they are only $4.99 I'm looking at some
swatches I'll have some photos inserted
here for anything but I don't have my
possessions that I'm talking about but
honestly I think is both a youtuber and
a consumer I'm going to be passing over
them I have so many highlights right now
I keep saying that I'm trying to put
myself on a highlight no buy for 99 is
still a really good price for a wet wild
highlight but I just know I don't need
them right now so no matter what a
consumer versus a youtuber I
just don't need it right now so I'm
going to be passing over the wet and
wild highlights but let us know what you
think about these and if you're super
excited I know they've got a lot of hype
so an older item that I wanted to talk
about even though it's not like old old
but in the attire to clay stick
foundation just came out with maybe like
a month or two ago
and I put it in a while I buy it and I
did say that I was going to buy it and
clearly I'm holding it I did buy it I
did have a review video on this
foundation sailing I can say that I
bought this stick foundation as a
youtuber because I definitely do have
not a super large foundation collection
just more recently I've been starting to
get more and more into foundations but I
have enough foundations that I didn't
need any more of these but a lot of
people were super hyped over this stick
foundation and so I was like you know
what I want to get it I want to be able
to review it for my channel I thought it
was important a lot of people are asking
me my opinions and if I was going to be
giving it then I got this one as a
youtuber versus a consumer because I
really wanted to get it early I bought
it from the Tarte website I didn't even
wait until it hits before Ulta I bought
it from the Tarte website the day that
it released so I could get it early so I
could review it for anyone that was
considering and getting it so my review
on this stick foundation it will be
linked down below you're curious to hear
my thoughts but yes this one was a
youtuber influenced purchase another new
item that I want to talk about in this
village is from huda beauty is coming
out with a new highlight palette for her
summer collection in solstice I believe
it's the name of it it's going to be $45
and they'll be coming out in July or
August reading off the treadmill website
like usual so her Instagram is always
linked down below this is another one
that has a youtuber and a consumer I am
going to be passing over just in general
and no I don't need this as a youtuber
or as a consumer I have so many
highlights my highlight collection is
huge I don't need any more highlights I
love so many of the highlights that I
own and I want to be able to wear them
so I just do not need another highlight
especially a 4 pan highlight palette so
this is one that I'm skipping over so
let us know if you are excited for her
new highlight palette well an eyeshadow
palette that I mentioned in a past will
I buy a video with the Urban Decay and
make it heat pallet I did end up
purchasing
Hallet I have been subsequently returned
to the palette because it ended up
nothing for me but I feel like I can
confidently say that I have also bought
this as a youtuber versus a consumer it
was a $54 eyeshadow palette more
expensive not quite Natasha Jamuna price
range yet but it was more expensive and
saying that just as a palette is
expensive I went by an as a consumer
because I was buying you know a few
high-end palettes here and there before
I even had a youtube channel it was more
expensive but I wasn't a huge urban
decay lover huge or Medicaid supporter I
don't have a lot from Urban Decay but I
feel like the main reason that I bought
it was because a lot of people asked me
for my review on it like I can say that
I did buy that as a youtuber it was
really important to me to get a review
video I'll because when people asked for
my reviews on products that really means
a lot to me that people watch my videos
for my opinions and respect them enough
to you know it helps them decide what
the makeup that they want to purchase it
just really does mean a lot to me so I
feel like that one even though there was
a lot of hype over it I still don't buy
it right away excels like I don't know I
don't know but then one more and more
people ask well what do you think about
to make it heat what do you think what
they make it heat will you please review
the naked heat I was like I should
really get on that so when I came out to
Sephora I did purchase it so I feel like
I can say that that one was purchased as
a youtuber like I said I did end up
returning it I can have my review video
link down below in case you are
interested on that one but yes the Urban
Decay Naked Heat that was a youtuber
influence purchase some new items that
are coming out from notice that I wanted
to put in here they were coming out
they're power matte lip pigment which is
a long we're a liquid lipstick it's
available in 20 different shades they'll
be available July 6 online at the NARS
website and then July 13th online and in
all other stores should be passing over
this as well NARS is again another brand
that I just don't have a ton from and
I'm not brand loyal to them in any sort
of the way they are more expensive and I
just don't feel like I need them in my
collection I just got a ton of lipsticks
I recently shared one of my more
overwhelming PR hauls ever I'll have
that video linked down below but I just
got a ton of lipsticks from NYX
from Avon from
like I just don't need anymore lipsticks
I don't feel like as a consumer I would
need these because of how big my
lipstick collection is right now but I
don't even feel like as a youtuber I
really need them to be able to review I
know there's so many people out there
who really love NARS and buy a lot from
them so they can go ahead and do their
review videos on them because I just
don't feel like I necessarily need these
in my collection at all so I'm going to
pass over these new lipsticks from NARS
both as a consumer and as a youtuber so
another eye shadow pellets and older
pellets that I want to talk about is
from BH Cosmetics and Carli bybel so
Carli bybel is a huge youtuber and she
teamed up for a second time with BH
Cosmetics to come out with an iron
shadow and highlights how they so in
case for some reason you haven't seen it
this is what the inside it looks like I
put this in a will I buy it and I said
that I was going to buy it I obviously
did buy it I do feel like this one I
purchased as a consumer my mom actually
bought me the first Carly in BH palette
for my birthday a couple years ago when
it came out and I really really loved it
so when I thought she was coming out
with the deluxe edition it made me want
it not just for as a youtuber and to be
able to review and do tutorials with it
was simply because I really wanted the
palette because I liked her first
palette and I really do like Carly but
has nothing to do with me being a
youtuber even though she definitely does
inspire me as a youtuber but she
inspires me just as a human being I love
Carly I've talked about her in a lot of
my videos I've done a Carly Bible made
me buy it I did a whole video on this
palette and actually being able to talk
to Carly with some issues that I was
having with my order and how she helped
me out so being a youtuber and not being
a youtuber she inspires me and motivates
me and I was really really looking
forward to getting this palette I'm
super happy that I have it but this is
one that I definitely feel like I
purchased as a consumer and not just as
a youtuber the Sephora Pro palettes are
some eyeshadow palettes that I mentioned
in a very recent will I buy a video I
was kind of on the fence in that video I
wasn't quite sure what I should do
because the one fella that I was
interested in the warm palette was $65
and I just think that was a little bit
more expensive I got a lot of mixed
feedback in that video and if I should
buy it or not I'm still kind of leaning
towards buying it like just a little bit
I have
not yet but I'm kind of leaning over
instead side as I'm watching more review
videos of it
but again I haven't made my full
decision buzz will say if I do go on and
end up purchasing the support warm
pellet I am buying that as a youtuber
versus a consumer I'm buying night to be
able to give my review on it to be able
to compare the Sephora eyeshadow formula
to maybe some other eye shadows and just
be able to let people know if I think
$65 is worth it for a support collection
eyeshadow palette I also don't own any
Sephora collection eyeshadow palettes so
again it would be helpful to me as a
youtuber because I do get asked a lot of
questions
what would you compare this to what
would you compare that to I want to buy
this eyeshadow but is there a dupe out
there that you know of and sometimes it
can be really hard if I don't I mean
obviously I can't own all the makeup but
sometimes it can be different be hard if
I don't have good comparisons or dupes
or just suggestions to be able to offer
other people so that's why what I've
kind of been trying to do recently is
branch out and try different brands and
different products that I haven't had
before so I can have more by
well-rounded collection so I can give
better suggestions when I'm asked those
questions so if I do end up purchasing
the Sephora Pro palette and the warm
palette is deafening to be as a youtuber
versus a consumer I do not believe that
the consumer I would purchase a $65
Sephora collection eyeshadow palette I
believe that I would purchase from a
brand that I love like if I'm going to
be spending that kind of money I feel
like I would purchase from a brand that
I love and I'm very loyal to because I
am a very brand loyal person I feel like
that is what I would do with my $65
instead so the Sephora Pro palette would
be a youtuber influence purchase if I do
make it sir item that I mentioned in a
past will I buy a video and I was also a
youtuber collab was the Smashbox and
casing homes spotlight palette and I got
to mine in the Pearl palette so this is
one that I also believe that I bought as
a consumer versus a youtuber Casey
Holmes was one of the first big
youtubers that I started watching I've
always just felt that friendship that
connection with her even though we will
probably never meet they've always felt
that was there so I was super excited
when I saw that she was coming out with
a collaboration with Smashbox this was
something that I actually didn't buy
right away and I feel like that's kind
of how I can also tell if I'm buying as
youtuber versus a consumer typically
when I'm buying as a youtuber I'm buying
Early's I do want to get videos up early
of course getting videos up early on how
products can be really great for views
and then even if you're in pretend like
views aren't important to me because
they definitely are I've said in the
past that I feel like views are more
important than your subscriber count
because it means a lot when people are
actually watching your videos but
definitely if you give products early
and you can get your review videos up
early they tend to get a good amount of
views because people are very curious
about songs are new to the market they
want to see what people are thinking
about them but also I'm trying to get it
up early because I want people to see
the reviews so that they know should
they buy it should they not buy it
especially items that have the
possibility of selling out but this was
one that I kind of took my time on I
waited until I came into Alta and then I
even waited until I knew the Alta 21
days of beauty sale was going to be
starting so I waited to purchase this in
also 21 days of beauties this wasn't on
sale but I paired it with something from
Smashbox actually the Smashbox photo
primer water when that went on sale I
also purchased this with it so that's
kind of another reason why I know that I
purchased as a consumer versus a
youtuber but again I just I knew I
wanted this palette in general anyways I
wanted to be able to support Casey but
the casing homes and Smashbox highlight
palette I bought as a consumer versus a
youtuber the last item that I want to
touch on in this twist on Ebola bias is
a new product this is a collaboration
with alpha beauty and love Melissa
Michelle is a palette that includes nine
eyeshadows a highlighter a blush and
also I'm at a liquid lipstick and it is
$20 and it will be available in stores
on July 23rd of course at Ulta so I'll
have a photo inserted here down below it
looks like a super cute palette I
unfortunately am NOT super familiar with
a love Melissa Michelle but now
definitely going to be looking her up
and checking her out I'm going to go
ahead and pass over it though I am kind
of like on a makeup overload I've just
gotten made a lot of really amazing PR
I've also been buying a lot of makeup
because I have my 20k giveaways going on
right now typically when I was buying
for those giveaways also purchasing for
myself so I've done a lot of makeup
shopping lately so I'm having an easier
time saying no to items but I feel like
kind of specifically when things are in
a collaboration with someone
unless I really know them and feel feel
a little from some right here for them
I'm it's easier for me to pass over them
because I just don't feel that kind of
pull and you know this is of course no
offense against Melissa Michele I am
very new to YouTube just watching
YouTube not even just having a channel
so I'm slowly like learning more and
more people every single day and finding
new people to watch so I guess I'm
definitely going to check her out but I
don't feel the pull and the palette just
didn't make me do the double take you
know I talked about the double taking a
lot of well about videos I really didn't
do the double take here so I know as
both a consumer and as a youtuber it's
not a palette that I need it's not
something that gives me loss of feels
and makes me do a double-take
so I know that I can confidently pass
over this palette but let us know in the
comment below if you plan on getting
this collab with also beauty and love
Melissa Michels are a so that is going
to do it for this week so will i buy it
video youtuber versus consumer let me
know in the comments down below what you
thought of this will I buy it with a
twist or if you have any other ideas for
a will abide with a twist of the future
I have one more with a twist of my
sleeve that you'll be seeing in the next
a month or so but next week's video and
probably the next week after that we'll
go back to the regular format of the
will a buyout where I'm just mentioning
a few products that just highness I'm
going to buy them or not but I thought
it would be kind of fun just to throw a
little something different in here since
I do the will I buy it every single week
and I have been doing it for several
months now we hope that you found it
interesting seeing what I purchased as a
youtuber and as a consumer and how those
can be different so let me know leave me
some comments down below let me know
what you thought and again if there's
any other will I've I to twist ideas
that you would like me to do but if you
guys did enjoy this video I hope that
you will give it a thumbs up and hope
that you'll also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys
real soon in my next one bye
