I'm really excited for today's video
because it's going to be another will i
buy it videos where i go through some
new releases in the beauty world and let
you guys know if i'm going to purchase
them or if i'm not going to purchase
them why i'm going to purchase them or
why i'm not going to purchase them i
also go into a little bit of detail on
you know price for its available at
what's included in this product and just
kind of like the pros and cons that i
think in general or any reviews that
i've seen already so far so I just kind
of break down each product for you like
always I have five different products
that I'm going to talk about some I will
buy some I will not buy but I'm just
really happy that you guys enjoy these
will i buy it videos because it gives me
a chance to be able to talk about some
new products and go into my thoughts on
them without feeling the pressure of
having to buy everything because it
definitely is a huge pressure being a
youtuber who doesn't get really fancy PR
baggages this really helps me out being
able to put out content for you guys
that I think is still somewhat enjoyable
because you guys keep asking for them
and giving me suggestions on what to do
in my next will i buy a video but
without having to spend money money
money money know what I'm saying but if
you would like to see my next edition of
will i buy it please keep watching come
on talk about is from Smashbox cosmetics
it is there light it up la lights
palette what's contour blush and
highlight so i will insert pictures of
each of the products that i'm going to
be talking about over here so you guys
can see what is inside of them but this
has nine different shades in there you
get blush you get highlights and you get
contour so i actually saw a few videos
come out about this on the reviews of
that and they were showing swatches of
it and nearly everybody's opinion of
this has been good the swatches have
been good just the overall consensus of
this palette has been but it's really
good now a couple months ago smashbox
actually did send me a PR package and
inside was a couple of their la lights
blush and highlight trios where it has
two blushes in a highlight so i actually
was able to you know test up smashbox
formula see if that you know if it's
something that I really like and I was
very impressed with the both the blushes
and the highlights that I was trying so
I only
one tree all for myself I gave the other
two away and I was actually really sad
about it sounds like I actually really
really like these they would have been
really nice to have in my collection but
I decided to put them and giveaways for
you guys so when I saw this palette I
was like that is a great way to get back
those blushes and the highlights that I
didn't have any more i have it all of
one nice palette and even get some
contour shades in there as well I
watched a lot of different review videos
I've looked up the reviews on awesome
the general consensus you know not
everyone's going to agree on everything
but kind of what I'm seeing the feedback
wise is that this palette is really good
it is thirty-nine dollars for the nine
different shades and it also is
exclusive to also you can get it on
smashbox website but it is an exclusive
to alta so it will be linked down below
I mean that I talked about will always
be linked down below but for this one
I'm gonna have to go ahead and say I
will buy this palette when I was doing
the research for this video I actually
could not find it I didn't realize it
was exclusive to Alta and I was
panicking i was like no this is gone
already like I actually really wanted
that once I started seeing more videos
on it I was like I really do want that I
really do want that and it's very
interesting because i'm not a huge blush
person I've said it in my videos before
I don't often gravitate towards blush
palettes because I'm simply just not a
big like blush lover you know so many
people are but that just happens to be
not what I'm super into but this just
really really caught my eye especially
being able to see a lot of the swatches
in the videos that was so helpful to me
and I just thought it looked amazing so
for thirty-nine dollars I like Alta I
have a lot of points build up at Alta so
I could definitely use my points over at
Alta but I also really really like
Smashbox cosmetics their brand that I've
started using a lot more off not only
like blushes and highlights an eyeshadow
palette from them that I think is
amazing and I also have their x-rated
mascara which i think is phenomenal and
that not enough people talk about so I'm
excited to give this a try I think this
would be a definitely a good good
purchase for the holiday season so i
think that i will be purchasing the
smashbox light it up blush highlight and
contour palette i want to talk about is
one that a lot of different people have
asked me as i am going to buy their nuts
if you guys ever have
product that you want me to talk about
either in the well I bias or my insight
haul videos please do leave that in the
comments below because I look at all the
comments and I try to include everything
that is that you're saying but this is
one that definitely so many people have
asked me about and it is the kat von d
metal matte eyeshadow palette so this
palette is sixty dollars and from the
support website it says an exclusive
ultra limited eyeshadow palette with 13
bridge mats and nine metal crush shades
ok so you know I've talked about in a
lot of my other bullabbai and anti halls
that I try to stay away the best as I
can from limited edition one thing that
I think is cool about the Smashbox
palette even though that is limited
edition because it's part of their
holiday set a lot of what is inside the
pallid is not limited edition the LA
lights blush and highlight trios that I
talked about I do not think that those
are limited edition so even if i was
using that palette but i was using a
specific blush that might not
necessarily be limited edition so that
was another thing that i did want to say
about smashbox but i do try to not buy
too much limited edition i'm not going
to say that i don't buy limited edition
because that is not true at all but i
tried to be cognizant of what exactly
i'm buying that is limited edition at
how much i'm buying because people do
get frustrated with things are limited
edition they often miss out on it then
when you constantly use in tutorials or
featuring it or recommending it people
are like cool but I can't get it so that
sucks so this one said it was ultra
limited edition i believe is what i read
though that's kind of like a red flag
right away sixty dollars is quite a bit
of money of course but then i've said it
before in so many my videos i'm not a
huge I shadow palette junkie I'm simply
not i'm not a blush person either but
I'm also not like a huge I shadow
palette junkie mostly because they are
obviously more expensive and there's
always at least one shade if not two or
three sometimes even more that just
aren't like the others they're not as
pigmented as the others or you know
they're just not the same quality or
shade that you would tend to reach for a
ton so looking at a picture of this you
know I see darker colors the blues
greens purples not a ton of shade
that I normally gravitate towards like I
have the Kat Von D shade + light eye
shadow palette and that is what is on my
eyes right now fabulous palette I use it
all the time because I love maths I love
neutrals I love Browns obviously that's
kind of like a palette for me these
crazy pops of colors I don't necessarily
use them a lot so there are quite a few
shadows in here that I'm like you know
what I'd probably only use these every
so often so it's sixty dollars worth it
for that for me I don't think so but I
have also been watching reviews on this
and I've been watching swatches on this
and again like the overall general
consensus as people aren't really loving
it I'm not saying that nobody out there
loves it because I have seen a couple
people say you know I really love this
palette and you know it's watch is great
for me but a lot of the reviews that I
read in the videos that I've watched
people aren't in love with it so you
know that Bank not being an eyeshadow
junkie having it be sixty dollars and
having it be a palette that I don't
think I would reach for a ton now that
kind of all adds up to me not going to
purchase this palette it does look
really nice I would definitely say check
it out like if it looks like it's your
cup of tea I mean height it could be
good for you if you're a big kat von d
collector I know a lot of people were
really excited about this palette but
for me I'll probably stick was in my
shade of my palette from kat von d
because that is like a go-to of mine but
rollin next we are going to talk about a
new eye shadow palette from marc jacobs
it is the marc jacobs beauty about last
night's style icon number 20 eyeshadow
palette so that is quite a name but new
eyeshadow palette from marc jacobs
beauty and it is ninety nine dollars so
i feel like you guys are already know
what I'm going to say because not only
am I nada eyeshadow junkie but ninety
nine dollars for an eyeshadow palette
that's not mess you not messing around
with this eyeshadow palette so from the
Sephora website it says this is a
limited edition pellet with 20 plush I
shadows and luxurious finishes for a
complete wardrobe of looks okay so 20
eyeshadow
nine nine dollars that's expensive so I
I like Marc Jacobs beauty I have a
couple products from them and I like
them but it is very very very pricey and
you know I just could not justify
spending ninety-nine dollars on an
eyeshadow palette the pellet looks nice
there are quite a bit of deeper colors
there is a black in there and people do
like having black I believe it looks
like there's a mirror from the pictures
that I'm seeing it does look like a
Amir's included which I would hope so
and a $99 palette it looks like there's
some mats in there I see some nice
shimmer shades in there as well this
palette also looks really large I
actually have not seen anybody do a
video on this yet but it looks like a
pretty large pallet so I don't think it
would be super easy to travel with but
again I just I kind of keep going back
to the ninety nine dollars you know I
have a lot of eyeshadow palettes that I
really love and I use like on a
near-daily basis and I think this one
looks nice but not enough for me to
justify spending ninety-nine dollars on
it with how much I think that I would be
picking it up again limited edition I
try not to buy a ton of limited edition
but i'm very curious like has anyone
bought this palette or will you buy this
palette i know so many people like on
these will i buy it and even my anti
health videos they're like I'm an
eyeshadow collector I'm an ipod of
junkie like eye shadow palettes are my
weakness so I know there are a ton of
you out there so you guys please tell me
like are you gonna purchase this one
have you already you haven't feedback on
it like let me know but let others know
because I think such a good thing about
YouTube is that we get to you know
bouncies around like so not only in
these types of videos where I can't
actually show you the product or show
you the swatches but I can just give you
my feedback as a normal person and said
this is what I think and this is you
know the thought process that goes into
me buying makeups but then you can go to
someone else's channel and you can see
the swatches and you can see their
feedback so you can get an even better
idea of if you should purchase this so
anyone does have this palette please
leave it in
comments down below let us know what you
think of it and if you think that it
would be worth it but for me limited
edition ninety nine dollars and an
eyeshadow palette I'm not going to be
purchasing this one want to talk about
is like a brand brand new release at the
point that i am filming this it is from
Tarte cosmetics and it is their tardis
pro Amazonian clay palette so I'm sure
many of others out there are watching
the snapchats oh but tarts trippin with
hearts trip that they are taking right
now with Barbara they have a handful of
influencers down there and these like
influence or trips look amazing I don't
know how I can get signed up for that
but like I'll raise my hand right now I
was looked amazing I've been watching
all the snapchats it looks crazy
incredible I've never been to Bora Bora
hope to get there someday but i think it
was like on one of the first days that
they were there tart announced that they
were dropping this new i shadow palette
and they have also dropped even more
throughout this trip like a highlight
and contour palette new lippies if
anybody wants to see those in upcoming
videos of will i buy it or anti hulls
please leave it in the comments below I
just chose to talk about the eyeshadow
palette because it was actually what I
first wrote down when I saw the snaps
coming out and then sell this palette I
was like need to put this in my will i
buy a video so that's why I just chose
this one but let me know if you want to
see more so for this palette it says it
is a pro-level everyday a shadow palette
with 20 ultra pigmented shadows powered
by naturally derived ingredients another
thing that I've seen at through the
snapchats with tart is that kind of
their thing with these new releases that
everything is natural natural natural
natural it's a really big thing right
now and the beauty community that I'm
seeing natural so you get 20 of the
different eyeshadow shades l and third
pitchers over here it comes with the
mirror and then I have like four eye
shadows on the side I believe those are
duochrome I shadows so interesting i
just recently purchased the tartlet and
bloom palette absolutely love it I have
the tart and style by her Rouge palette
absolutely love it I've been a big fan
of the tart eyeshadows this palette is
going to be $53 so this one took me a
hot second with the kat von d on the
marc jacobs booty i was like nope
immediately knew
those aren't for me I won't be
purchasing them this one i sat down I
looked at it I watched the swatches of
the influencers in Bora Bora who have it
they're doing the swatches and creating
the looks with it I was like me and
there's duel crumbs in there I've
recently been getting into duo Chrome's
if you see my last makeup tutorial using
the wet and wild pellet I was like so
pleasantly surprised that there was a
dual chrome in there I wasn't ready for
it so this one was actually a really
tough decision for me but i decided that
i'm not gonna buy it honestly i think it
looks really good i do i think it looks
really good I've been very impressed
with tards eyeshadow palettes but $53 is
a bit expensive we know I'm not an
eyeshadow junkie we know I say it all
the time we know but I haven't seen
anything that said it was limited
edition so I'm even I'm looking at the
tart website right now it doesn't say
limited edition so I hope it's not
because limited edition like seriously
gets so old after a while I hope this
one is not limited edition because maybe
in the future this can be one that I
purchased like i just bought the tartlet
and balloon palette because everybody
still raves about it so even though
that's not anywhere close to a new
release like I just bought it sounds
like this pilot looks amazing and it is
so hopefully it's not a limited edition
so in the future in case I changed my
mind but at this moment in time I'm not
going to purchase it because at like I
said I've just purchased the style by
her uche palette very recently i just
bought at the tartlet and balloon
palette not that long ago and for
someone who says she's not a big iron
shadow junkie I find a couple eyeshadow
palettes here and there I just got the
350 from morphe not too long ago like I
have newer I shadow palettes that I feel
like I need to be using more before I
start buying a ton of new eyeshadow
palettes honestly this how it looks
really fun and that you know you have
your fun pops of colors and there but
nothing like too overwhelming there's
still a lot of really pretty neutrals in
there so i think the pellet looks really
really pretty i do maybe this could be
something or like I cash and by ulta
points and get type of thing because
honestly I do want it like if money was
no factor to me I would probably
purchase this one but I'm
originally like most people money is a
factor for me so I have to pick and
choose out of which categories for
beauty that I want to be spending my
money on and right now I'm gonna have to
say no to the palette for that reason
but like I said hopefully it's not going
to be limited edition and it'll stick
around for a while I can actually see
because it just released three no two
days before i'm filming this video i
haven't seen a ton of reviews on it yet
i haven't seen a ton of swatches or
makeup tutorials on it yet so you know
it'll also give me some time to check it
out watch other people's youtube videos
look at their Instagram post of swatches
and make my decision from there just $53
it's just a little bit more expensive
for me I know it's all natural I know
it's supposed to be like a pro palette
but you know just for mostly money
reasons at this time I won't be
purchasing the palette but looks really
good if anyone else has got it or you've
already got it in your hands let us know
in the comments down below I guess so I
got one more to talk about and I am
really excited to talk about this so
this is a new collab with morphe brushes
and a youtuber kathleenlights they are
collabing together to put out a new eye
shadow palette so i love morphy as the
brand i have a lot of products from them
including eyeshadow palettes and I've
been impressed with about everything
that I've gotten from them I also really
enjoy kathleenlights I've been a
subscriber to her for a very long time I
appreciate how relatable she seems and
how genuine she seems and not only that
but I have purchased a lot from her
collapse like especially with a color
pop I purchased a lot from her collabs
with that company and I have been
impressed with everything that I've
purchased so far that she has done a
collab with so when I saw that she was
collabing with the morphe I got pretty
excited this collab has been kind of us
been at secret Kathleen's been doing
quite a few collabs lately and she'd
kind of kept teasing like I have one
more coming I have one more coming and
it was kind of like who was it going to
be with who's gonna be with it's gonna
be with morphy and I got really excited
because I'm a big big fan of more feel
like I said great brand great products
still an affordable price I appreciate
that so the
clean lights and more of a palette will
have 15 different eyeshadows some are
eyeshadows that more pays already
released some are new eyeshadows that
will be exclusive to this palette that
Kathleen helped come up with so 15
shadows the palette we release on more
peace website on october 25th the only
downside to this one right now is that I
still have not been able to find a price
I what sometimes when I film these will
i buy it up items are still so new that
prices haven't been released yet this is
one of them so if by the time that I put
this video up the price has been
released I will leave it linked in the
description box down below and I can put
it up here but at the time i'm filming
price has not been released yet but it
will launch october 25th so i know what
you guys are thinking and this will be a
limited edition so it's going to be
limited edition and it's an eyeshadow
palette and I don't have a price yet so
I'm probably not going to buy it right I
think I'm going to buy this one guys so
you know we all have our different
things and this is why I'd like to do
these alive by videos because I take you
through my thought process of what it
means of how i buy makeup so even though
there's no price morphy is known for
being more affordable there are 35
eyeshadow palettes at 350 and the 35 t
that I both own I believe those were
2299 there's also a zillion discount
codes out there for morphe used to get
ten percent off of purchase I'm sure
kathleenlights probably has one herself
that I would use when i purchased this
product so automatically I think that
you're gonna probably get ten percent
off of this palette so no matter what
the prices I don't think it's going to
be in the fifty dollar range like the
tart one it's not going to be the sixty
dollar range like the kat von d and it's
definitely not going to be a hundred
dollars like the marc jacobs it should
be on the more affordable side plus a
discount also I've been wanting to place
an order with more fee for a very long
time you get free shipping on orders
over a hundred dollars I literally have
been waiting to that one hundred dollar
mark because i want free shipping yes
yes this this is my life this is who i
am i want free shipping i don't care if
I have to spend a hundred dollars when
all i want is like a makeup sponge that
cost seven ninety-nine i will wait until
products come out that i really want to
get that hundred dollars to get that
free shipping it is just who i am it's
just who I am so I'm excited for that
reason even though it is limited edition
I still think that I will purchase this
one
and even though it's an eyeshadow
palette once again I'm still planning on
purchasing this palette I really do
stand behind more fees I shadows I have
their eye shadow palettes I think
they're amazing kathleenlights love her
as a youtuber but I've been super
impressed with all of the collabs that
she has done in the past that i
purchased myself I haven't purchased all
of her collabs but I've purchased quite
a few and I've been very impressed with
them I have already seen swatches of
this on snapchats it looks like they've
already gone out to some of the beauty
influencers so they have been watching
on their snapchats I have been watching
I have been impressed like I said it's
15 different eyeshadows it looks like
there's a combination of Matt and
shimmers there are some fun colors in
here that I am Not Afraid of like
there's a few pops of colors that I'm
like okay I can get down that but
overall it does it kind of does look
like a more neutral type of palette and
what I would gravitate towards why I
think that I'm going to purchase this
palette because i figured that i was
going to purchase us like this the
moment that I saw that this release was
coming out like it clicked in my mind
that I was like yep I want that so when
thinking about a palette like the tart
palette one that I was like you know
what I actually really do want this but
you know for money reasons is that sort
of thing is because i also am planning
on purchasing this morphe palette so do
i need to buy two eyeshadow palettes at
the exact same time and spend you know
more money on that no so that is kind of
how I pick and choose if I see an
eyeshadow palette that I'm like yep this
is what i want and i will probably forgo
the other eye shadow palettes and i will
pick the one that i want the most this
one happens to be the one that i want
the most so that's kind of a another
insight into my makeup planning
decision-making thing you know what I'm
saying they excited the swatches have me
excited the shades have me excited just
waiting now anxiously to see that price
because I mean you never know it could
be something crazy but more unlikely is
going to be pretty affordable including
a ten percent off code like I'm down
with it so I'm really excited again once
i see the price that will leave it
linked in the description box and down
below and it launches october twenty
fifth on the morphe website but i'm
excited about this one everything for my
latest will i buy it video i really hope
that
you guys enjoyed the video and me going
in-depth on some products and showing
you kind of the thought process that I
have when it goes into buying my makeup
and how I decide what I'm going to
purchase and what I'm going to pass on
so hopefully you found this video
helpful or informative or something
along those lines if you guys have any
other new releases that you'd want to
see me talk about in upcoming videos
