today's video is going to be all about
the winter beautycon box so i was sent
this box this is the third beautycon box
that i have received the other two i
have both mentioned in like PR hall so I
just kind of briefly touched on them but
I'm not gonna lie I opened this one by
myself I went out and got the mail one
night at like eleven o'clock at night
and this box was in there and I was like
I want to see what's in it and then like
my jaw dropped this box is amazing and I
was like you know what I'm going to film
a YouTube video all about this box
because I was blown away so the beauty
comebacks does come quarterly so I've
received the summer box and the fall box
and now this is the winter box the
summer box I thought was absolutely
amazing like blew my socks off amazing
the fall box I still thought was really
good I didn't think it was as good as
the summer box and now the winter box
I'm like it might even beat out the
summer box for me not going to lie so
I'm really excited I'm going to take you
through it do the unboxing for you I
will leave links down below if you want
to get your boutique on box I believe
it's ninety-nine dollars if you sign up
for an annual I'm to get all four boxes
or its twenty nine dollars a month I
believe I will have all the information
listed down below I do have a discount
code for five dollars off your box if
you want to get a discount it is just
March winter it's kind of funny right
and then also if you are new to the
beautycon box if you haven't signed up
for one before when you do sign up for
the first time you receive an extra box
which is pretty cool but I will go ahead
and take you through the box and show
you what is inside so each time the box
comes out it is a curated by someone so
this month it was dulce candy so there
is a little post in here s 0 on the back
it does list everything that is inside
the box as well which i think is really
helpful so let's see starting off we
have some mascaras so these are from
l'oreal so one is a mascara primer so
it's their voluminous primer base so
that is what that one looks like and
then it also came with the l'oreal
volume is a feline
I have seen this and I thought the
packaging was really cool so I've seen
this one going around and I'm really
excited I want to try both of them I've
seen good things about the primer and
I'm excited to try this mascara so
pretty cool so I got pretty excited when
I saw this little guy this is a garden a
skin active micellar cleansing water I
have the big one of this guy and I'm
actually kind of running low on it but
this is like the perfect travel size and
as I'm filming like as soon as i get
done filming we were on the road so I'm
filming this Christmas Eve the day
before Christmas Eve so we are about to
get on the road so this is going to now
be going in my bag so I thought that was
really awesome there's also a brush in
here which I love brushes so I was so
excited to see that it's a Luxy brush so
they have really cute brushes with like
the pink handles this is the 522 tapered
highlighter brush so this is what it
looks like so it is for highlight ok I
see that I see that I have a couple of
other Lexi brushes I've gotten them all
in like subscription boxes but I love
brushes so I'm excited to get a brush in
there then we have a big old guy this is
body karate cream from skin wolf skin
valve it has caffeine and argon oil to
hydrate tone smooth improve skin texture
this is a big bottle and I'm actually
really excited about this especially
because it has caffeine and the argan
oil in it I'm pretty excited to try this
is a coupon in here as well for Ali and
Jay Los Angeles it says we've teamed up
with beautycon to give you fifty dollars
for your next order of 100 or more at
ali g calm so that is in there as well I
also pulled out a sheet mask which
excited me so much if you're going to
love sheet masks so this is from bio
Bell it's a botanic fiber facial mask
like yes please i friggin love face mask
so much so it says it's a facial mask
with almond oil and vitamin E so happy
so happy also have some color pop inside
which made me super excited so this is a
lippy stick from colour-pop and it just
says that it is in beautycon so this
must be a special shade for the box so
let's go ahead and
what it looks like ooh ok so that is in
beautycon and it's just my type of shade
it is just like a nude pink shade some
brown in there yep that's beautiful I
really like the colour-pop lippie Stix
so that makes me super excited he this
made me so happy to see even though
color pop is so affordable it doesn't
matter i thought color pop in there and
I was like I can't wait to try what's in
it ok so also inside this is from kate
somerville it's the exfoliate intensive
exfoliating treatment and it's a pretty
decent size of it as well I'm really
excited for this because I've tried a
lot of samples of this and actually
wanted to buy a full size so when I saw
this I was like are you kidding me
because this is going to let me have
quite a few uses so I was so excited to
see this I think this is a really really
good exfoliator we have another lippy
this one is from Rimmel and it is in
best of the best this looks to be a red
shade so i might not swatch this because
I don't wear red a ton so I might just
hang on to that for a second because i'm
not sure if I would keep that one just
because I don't wear red all the time
but I'll have to think about that one
that was rimmel in a best of the best
okay and then the last two items inside
this is from to face it is like a deluxe
sample of the chocolate soleil bronzer
in median deep I have this I love it i'm
actually wearing it right now as my
bronzer I love it and I'm always so
shocked how long this little guy has
lasted I've like just barely hit pan in
mine but I'm so excited to have a backup
because it's one of my favorite bronzers
and I'm not kidding you this little
thing will last you so incredibly long
so I got so excited when I saw this I
was like to face are you kidding me like
that is amazing but then the last item
inside I was so excited about you guys
this is from artists couture and it's
one of the diamond glow powders in
Illuminati like what I was like no way
that is crazy i was so not expecting
that there's the back of it because
artists couture is
angel moreno or mac daddy and he
actually was the curator in the fall box
him and makeup Shayla were like coke
curators of the box and I like when I
saw that he was a curator I was so
excited because I was like I bet the
diamond glow powders will be inside and
there wasn't and i know i watched a lot
of what they unboxing videos and watch a
lot of the feedback and everybody was
like why were those not included like
hello so I don't know if beautycon heard
that or what but it's in this box and I
was still forget excited these have so
much hype around them so I'm just so
pumped um let's see I'm so excited and I
just realized the brush that we got is a
highlighting brush and then we got a
highlighter like okay I get it so I'm
going to put some on the brush and then
see what we can get okay I don't know
how I'll be able see it because I have a
very bright light shining but there is
Illuminati can you guys see that I'll do
swatches on Instagram as well but
ho-ho-hold that's so pretty yep nope the
cameras it's not going to do anything
for it my life that I'm sorry it's so
it's dark out so I have to have my
bright lights on so you're not going to
be able to see it very good but oh it's
really I'm not gonna stop doing that cuz
you can't see it it's beautiful I'm so
excited oh I'm so excited I'm taking
that I'm putting this in my bag I'm
putting this in my bag it's coming with
me out of town I'm so excited that was
like when I saw that lie clearly my
mouth dropped open there was a color pop
there was sheet masks there was to face
now there's the diamond glow powder I'm
like this might be my favorite beautycon
box yet like I said the summer one was
amazing i thought the summer one was so
good but i'm pretty sure the winter box
is gonna be dead what do you guys think
are you excited about the box will you
get it have you got it let me know in
the comments down below but this box has
me all sorts of shook okay guys that's
going to be it for the winter beautycon
box unboxing I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
and were you as excited about the boxes
I am because I went crazy for this one
again the curator was dulce candy she's
a very well
no an influencer and i have to say that
i think that she freakin nailed it with
this box there is not one thing besides
maybe the remote lipstick just because
it's not a shade i normally wear but
everything else I'm keeping and I'm
excited about I'm excited to use I'm
excited to try out usually when i get
any sort of subscription box i'm like oh
you know i can give this away or I can
put that in an upcoming giveaway but
this one I'm just so stoked about again
I did some price checking really quick
just to kind of see you know some things
are deluxe samples like the two-faced
one but for the luck zbrush that is
twenty-four dollars on its own and the
artist Couture diamond glow powders I
believe they are 2699 and again this box
is twenty-nine dollars so with
everything that you're getting inside I
think it is an amazing deal again if you
do an annual it's ninety-nine dollars
seasonal is 29 or I do have the five
dollar off code which is a March winter
that will be listed down below as well
if you're new to the beautycon box and
you sign up with this one you will get
an extra box which i think is super cool
I'm not sure what exactly is inside that
box I don't think you just get like an
extra winter box I'm not sure exactly
how that works but you do get an extra
box which i thought was awesome but I'm
excited I just had to come on and do
this video for you guys it's not a
sponsored video my discount code is not
an affiliate code it's just a code for
you guys but I just was so excited when
I opened that box beautycon i think is a
box that isn't talked about enough we
hear about a lot of other subscription
boxes on youtube but i don't think i see
enough about beautycon and when i open
this box I was like you know what I'm
making this video I don't care I'm so
pumped about this box so let me know
what you guys thought about the box down
below again are you going to get it have
you already gotten it what do you think
what are you most excited for that I
showed you from the box and these boxes
are the same so everybody will get
what's inside it's not like an Ipsy
where you get different products from
someone else so if you like what you saw
in here and or there several items in
here that you're excited about I say go
ahead and get the box because I think
it's a fantastic deal this box just got
me feeling all kinds of good things all
kinds of good things it was like
christmas came early with this box
but that is going to wrap it up for this
video guys because I gotta get on the
road and celebrate the holidays with my
family so thank you guys so much for
