today's video is going to be a new
makeup tutorial this is my winter peach
daytime glam makeup tutorial I've been
getting a lot of requests to use the Too
Faced
sweet peach palette so here we go so I
did go ahead and prime my eyes
off-camera with some concealer and then
I'm just placing peaches and cream all
over to set everything I'm just using my
morphe m-44 wanna brush mostly just for
convenience because I'm going to pick
that up next and jump into puree from
the palette so simply a convenience
thing there for a period it's a really
great like warm brown shade so I'm first
placing this on the outermost part of my
eye really making sure the majority of
the product is there before I start to
slowly blend that in across my eye and
then I'm gonna pick up my morphe M 4-3-3
it's just a smaller blending brush and
I'm going to jump into just peachy it's
a really pretty peachy pink shimmery
color I like this one because it's a
lighter color and you can leave it light
or you can build it up to whatever your
preference is but I like that because
sometimes with pinks if you go in a
little too hard it can look a little
crazy so I like that you can build this
one up to your preference so for this
shade I am mostly focusing it right on
the center of my eye and then once the
majority of the product is there then
I'm also blending that out throughout
the eye and then I'm going to pick up my
Sigma E 54 brush and nectar from the
palette this is one of my favorite
shades in here it's just a really
beautiful shimmer shade I'm placing this
and just kind of patting it on the inner
part of my eye I'm not gonna bring it
past the center of my eye just lightly
patting it to kind of brighten
everything up and then also tie
everything together and then once that
shade is placed down I'm just going to
pick up my smaller blending brush and
just kind of blend everything together
make sure that there's no harsh lines
and then for my eyeliner I'm using an
elf
liquid eyeliner and in the shade brown I
like to do Browns when I'm using when
I'm doing like a softer type of look I
think it's just a little softer than a
black eyeliner this liner I actually
picked up for my drugstore makeup
challenge tutorial and I remember
thinking that I didn't mind it it was
like one of the few products that I
didn't hate but I really struggled with
it so I don't know what I was thinking
it wasn't super pigmented which again
was fine because I didn't need like a
really dark eyeliner but still the
pigmentation wasn't great and then just
the wand is super flimsy so really hard
to create a wing but to the face I'm
using my Milani Prime shield the
mattifying primer and then the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi I'm just placing that on
my Sigma f80 brush for my foundation I
love this brush one of my favorites
foundation was mentioned in best of
beauty 2016 so obviously that is a
favorite as well for concealer I'm using
the Maybelline better skin and then I'm
placing this underneath that my eyes and
I'm also going to place it in the center
of my face to highlight everything and
so that is my forehead down the bridge
of my nose Cupid's bow and awesome my
chin and then I am using my Sigma s 79
to blend that all out of this has turned
into one of my favorite favorite brushes
for the job if I'm not reaching for my
Beauty Blender I am typically reaching
for that brush
and then I'm gonna pick up my wet and
wild contouring palette I'm in dulce de
leche I'm gonna use both sides of it
actually so with my Sigma p89 brush I'm
going to take the setting powder and
place this wherever my concealer is so
starting off under my eyes pressing
right up under the lower lash line
to help prevent creasing and I also
really love this powder as a brightening
powder I think it really helps brighten
the under eyes and like I said I'm gonna
place it on the other areas where I
applied the concealer as well and then
jumping into the contour side of the
palette and picking up my Sigma fo6
since this is more of a daytime look I
didn't do cream contour or heavy baking
or anything like that but I do like to
take this Sigma brush because I think it
is really good for a contour as well
it's it's firm but soft at the same time
it's so hard to describe but it's such a
versatile brush I use it for so many
different things but I'm going to
contour some cheekbones and then also
place that product on my forehead and my
jawline also and then I'll take it and
just run it down the sides of my nose I
don't do much for nose contouring but I
like to bring a little bit of color back
to the nose and then going into my wet
and wild blush and might I buy you a
drink with my morphe m42 7 I love this
blush and it's a really beautiful like
peachy shimmery blush so obviously I
thought it went really well with the
look we have going on but definitely a
favorite and then to finish off the eyes
I'm going to take and mr. Bing from
colour-pop and Kathleen lights it's a
really beautiful like rich warm brown
shade and placed that into my waterline
and then picking up my morphe 36 and
bless her heart from the palette this is
like my favorite shade in the palette
and I always try to find a way to wear
this when I'm using the sweet peach
palette for this look I placed it on the
lower lash line for a fun pop of color
then using my Too Faced better than sex
mascara I am using lashes that you of
course don't have to for a daytime look
or any look if you don't want to
I typically always wear eyelashes and I
didn't love my liner so the lashes kind
of cover that up I used the Ardell 113
and I also just put some gimme brow
through my eyebrows quickly off-camera
as well for highlight I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kit in that
glow and picking up bubbly and my Sigma
f40 to brush and placing this on my
cheekbones down the bridge of my nose on
my tip of my nose and also my Cupid's
bow you of course don't have to
highlight as well but with a peachy look
I think it highlights kind of makes
everything pop and come together and I
also just really love highlight so
there's that for lips I'm going to
finish it off using a color pop speed
dial
this is an ultra matte lip from there
just peachy lip bundle
I liked this kind of dirty peach type of
color with this look because there was
lighter peach shades that I could choose
from but since we went so light on the
eyes I thought a darker color would kind
of make everything pop so that is why I
chose speed dial and I just absolutely
loved the way that it turned out and I
hope that you did too because after the
lips I'm just going to spray my face
with a little bit of mac fix+
and then this look is complete so I
really hope that you guys loved this
