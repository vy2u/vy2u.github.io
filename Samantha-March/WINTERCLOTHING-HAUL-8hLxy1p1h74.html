thank you for watching today today's
video I'll do a clothing haul I did one
of these a few months back it was
probably in the summer but it was
received really well so I always had it
on my radar to do another one I just
honestly don't shop a whole lot play a
big part of the reason that I don't do a
lot of like clothes shopping is because
I work from home so I'm able to wear
pajamas every day so not like a lot of
people are always trying to find like
professional clothes and things like
that and I wear yoga pants so I really
honestly don't do a whole lot of clothes
shopping it's something I do very
sporadically but we just obviously had
black friday so i picked up a few pieces
I do have some new yoga clothes to show
you I like to share what I picked up
from yoga companies is half three this
time but I really like them and I've
been very excited to wear them I have
some stuff from victoria secret which is
one of the main places that I shop at I
have like two main stores I shop out one
is victoria secret the other one is top
off clothing if you guys have seen my
videos you've heard me talk about top
loft it is owned by my sister-in-law she
just got an idea was it like two years
ago almost two years ago maybe that she
wanted to start her own store she
started out as a website and she now has
a physical store in Carroll Iowa where
she lives and she has a super successful
boutique I love shopping there obviously
because I love supporting my family and
small business but I just love the
pieces that she has in there so whenever
I and back visiting with my in-laws I
always make sure to pop into top loft
but you have those are the three stores
that I have to share with you but if you
guys would like to see my latest
clothing haul please keep water as well
go through the yoga clothes that I got
since there's just three pieces but one
company that i got from is how do you
pronounce it now Anzhi on ze yoga I
think it's 0 n
ie apparel and at first I kept calling
them like onesie I think its own Z 0 and
z apparel they haven't like listed in
their Instagram page like how to print
out that goes sure people get tripped up
but I love these so these are full
length leggings so they go all the way
down I usually put if any of you guys
are wondering like why I love yoga
clothes so much I actually run a yoga
Instagram page with my best friend we
are the teachers on Instagram I will
leave a link to our page below that's
why I'm super interested in yoga we post
multiple times a day we're always doing
new challenges we host a lot of yoga
challenges so if you're interested at
all in getting into yoga i would suggest
checking out the cheeky chicks you guys
have seen our pictures a lot of Yogi's
will wear their leggings like over their
heels of them and that's what we do so
when i get full length leggings i like
to make sure that there long enough that
that can fit over my heels that makes
any sense but that's what these are and
again it's just maybe and then they have
these sheer black mesh panels in them
and the mesh is I I just love the mesh I
have another pair from flexi Lexi
fitness I can put in here but they are
all black and then they have black mesh
I absolutely love them I where I'm out
all the time I I will always have
someone multiple people come up to me
when I wear them out and say how much
they love my tights and like where did I
get them and I say their yoga pants and
they get kind of confused but they are
but I like to wear these because I can
wear them out so in the summer it's
really not a big deal because I can wear
like you know regular shorts or skirts
or dresses or maxi skirts but in the
winter it's either i have like black
leggings that i can wear or jeans you
know i don't mind wearing like my crazy
prints out when we're just like doing
something fun but they were going out
for a nice occasion I don't want to work
like my bright pink and green ombre yoga
leggings and stand out but I still don't
want to wear jeans because i hate gee I
don't want
I pick up these they like I don't know I
just feel like these are like night out
pants and then especially paired with
like black heels or even like tall black
boots they look really good so I have
one of these a few times now and low if
another pair from Anzhi and I think they
were having a black friday special where
if you bought two there was like some
sort of discount so I got these these
are capris so they come like just below
my knees but I just thought they were
kind of interesting i was going for
something like a little bit on the
darker side usually I'm attracted to
like lighter colors and pinks and blues
and things like that and i was like no
get something that like says winter so I
honestly don't know what exactly is on
this print it looks like some sort of
water and I don't know but it's like
really dark grey especially up by the
waistband so I really like that I will
say with Anzhi i will put the link to
them below if i can find these exact
lightens that i bought i will link to
them too so their sizes you could either
order extra small small small medium and
I think medium large and I wasn't sure
exactly where to go so just like went in
the middle too small medium and they are
a little bit too big so I think maybe if
you're like borderline on one maybe pick
the smaller route it's not bad like they
still fit and it'll be fine but they are
just like a little bit too big for me so
that's a quick sizing thing in case you
want to order from them and then the
other company that I ordered from is a
low yoga now a low yoga I love a low I
don't even know how many followers LOL
gehäuse on Instagram they are a huge
yoga company they're actually sold we
have shields here in one of our malls
and aloe cells in shields so it's kind
of nice because sometimes shields will
be running at discount and I can get a
low at a discounted price because they
are also very very expensive they are
known for their goddess leggings which I
can put a picture of me nice leggings up
here and there just kind of like the
two-tone leggings almost and
I really do I like the likings I
actually bought the baddest leggings
last year black friday because they had
such a good sales that i was because the
Gosling's i'm pretty sure like either
100 or 110 dollars like that's too
expensive for me to spend even though i
wear yoga leggings every single day like
i can justify buying expensive yoga
leggings because i wear them so much and
because I put them on Instagram a lot of
times we actually end up working with
different companies and we're really
lucky that we get sent a lot of yoga
clothes too so I actually don't have to
buy that much because we get sent stuff
to help promote the our Instagram which
is so amazing but hello is just it is a
very expensive company so I think they
had a thirty percent off for black
friday and I was like I'll jump on that
I thought about getting goddess leggings
again but i thought because i already
have the ones like I kind of wanted to
do something a little bit different so I
got these I think these were called the
Talia leggings so this is what they look
like they are full length cover my heels
once again but they have like these
black stripes and they go all the way
around and i can show i can insert you
look a picture in here too so you can
see kind of what they look like but i
just thought they looked so cool and I
really loved this like red burgundy
color especially for like this time of
the year I thought the color was really
awesome and then I don't know something
about like these black stripes I just
thought they looked really cool and when
you do like when you go upside down I
just think the leggings look awesome see
I think they were the Italia leggings
but I will go ahead and link below they
have a lot of different colors which I
think was really awesome and then here
is that have like this little a logo
right here and like when you're out it's
like metallic like it shines on you it's
kind of fun but i really like these and
I've warned these out before too and I
just warm with black heels and I mean I
thought they worked really well together
so a lot of times my yoga clothes can
double as you'll go workout clothes and
going out clothes to rehab so these are
from a low and i will leave them linked
below then i'll go through what i got
from topple off to clothing and again
top left is a boutique it is located in
care
Iowa so if you're around the Des Moines
Carol area i would say stop in there
sometime if you can but she also does
have an online website and some of these
orders are from when i was there in the
store but then some of them are i
purchased online because we just were
not getting back to carol and i was like
i need some clothes because we're
changing seasons and so i just ordered
online and I got it and like two days
she has super fast shipping so I will
leave the links below and I will try to
find everything that I mentioning but
because it is a boutique she often you
know changes around her inventory but i
will try to find everything if i can so
my first one is this like big comfy
sweater can you guys see that big
sweater and then the sleeves are plaid
and then also the back at the bottom is
plaid too and I just loved this this is
one that I ordered online and I was a
little afraid because I was like I want
a big comfy sweater like I don't want it
to be short I don't want it to be tight
like I want it to be a comfortable
sweater and i still i think i ordered a
small i don't see the size on here i'm
pretty sure i ordered a small and i was
like should i order small our medium i
ordered a small and it worked out great
it fits me so well it's long so i can
wear it with leggings because you know
when you wear yoga leggings you don't
wanna wear a short shirt and then like
things look strange so you want to wear
long and that's what this is and i just
i absolutely love it i think it is so
cute she has a lot if you guys like this
like plaid style I know that they have a
lot in there right now like she has ones
with like black and white plaid my plaid
in the different areas there's so much
cute stuff in there I'm going shopping
this weekend when we go back for a
family Christmas and I kind of can't
wait to go back if I got is this like
camo type sweater I don't know I'm like
I'm super attracted to this green color
recently I found a sally hansen nail
polish that's kind of like this darker
green and all of a sudden I can't find
it anymore I should have just bought it
when I first thought I didn't do it now
really upset because I can't find it
again but I just thought it was super
cute appeared with like black leggings
and brown boots it is it is a sweater
and it does have long sleeves but I will
say one thing that I didn't know is that
it kind of goes up like if I raise my
hands it kind of goes up and the sleeves
like I don't know if you guys would be
able to tell by the sleeves where does
this leave but like I don't know can you
guys see like how it's not like a normal
sleeve so it's really easy to like kind
of bunch the slaves of which is nice I
just wasn't expecting that that I would
just be like a regular old sweater but
it does kind of have like a little bit
of edge to it which I liked and I got
this one in a small too and again the
size fits really well and then another
piece that I picked up this like black
and camel long-sleeved shirt so I really
liked it because I thought it was like
very basic here's the back is very plain
I thought it was very basic but yet
stylish at the same time and I like the
hints of camel on here camel is a very
on trend shady right now so I thought
that was kind of cool how it has it up
here and then of course the pocket is
too I really liked it it is a small I
got the small as well but another thing
about this is that it's very long so
again I can wear this very easily with
yoga leggings because it is definitely
very long I feel like companies are
getting smarter and making longer shirts
because they understand that we want to
wear yoga leggings more not even just
yoga like it's just like in general we
don't like jeans they hurt but then
speaking of denim when I was putting in
the online order and i was looking at
everything on the website I kept finding
this denim shirt and I was like you know
what I don't have one so i think i'm
going to go for it so i did i got this
denim shirt and I just wow I literally
just Ward out last night so it doesn't
even but endure anything but that's what
it looks like and then here's the back
you can see like there's a little bit of
a different style here on the side and
then the sleeves are short and they
just kind of like button up here on the
end I'm sure you could probably undo
this Kenya yeah sure you can probably
undo that and make it longer but so far
I've just worn it short and I really
like it that way and it just buttons up
I got it in a small and I was a little
bit worried um because I have a larger
chest I didn't want to have it because
you have to button it I was like is it
going to be okay and so I actually
texted my sister-in-law was like can I
get away with the small and she said
that she thought i could and i can
honestly it was a lot more roomier than
i thought it was going to be I have no
troubles wearing you this I ward out
last night and even my husband said he
really likes this shirt and I thought
well thank you then so yeah just a
little denim top and then I have one
more piece from topple off and you'll
have to forgive me it is pretty wrinkly
because it was actually in my laundry
but I was like no I want to show it but
looks like a very simple white top again
it is like it is very very long but then
I think it's really cool because on the
back it's all aligned with buttons which
I thought was a lot of fun but then like
the elbows on each sleeve have this
fabric right here so i just thought it
was very fun because it looks like a
very like basic white tee I think I wore
it in my Sephora giveaway video so like
from the front it just looks like a
pretty simple white shirt but then from
the back it's got those buttons that are
kind of fun and the sleeves have the
cool black and white again very very
long like I could easily wear this with
leggings but I could also wear it with
even like tights or something like that
and almost like wear it as a cute and
like casual dress so yeah one of my
favorite new pieces and my collection
very excited I got it I actually I loved
so much that she was like by the time I
shopped there there wasn't any smalls
left and there was medium and I was like
I'm going for it because I want this
shirt so bad but I feel like that
probably helped off the length a little
bit more too and I bet like come spring
it would look really cute to wear was
like black tights and then black heels
and then just the shirt so I'm excited
for that but yeah that's everything that
i got from top left check the
scription box below for all the links
and I hope you guys will there's one I
picked up is this like pink kind of like
flannel type not flannel like um long
underwear type shirt and it's just got
the same design all over it I really
like it it's not it's not super long but
it definitely is long enough that I can
wear over leggings I got in a size small
and I think this was featured like in
their fashion show too but they had they
had black they had white and then they
also have like matching shorts with it
then I'm pretty sure I even saw a onesie
in this material but I really liked it I
just thought it was like very cute and
casual and just a good basic winter
shirt to wear when I'm over here saying
that I'm super cold thing I picked up as
a sports bra and I got it just because
it simply made me laugh I was like this
is probably going to do nothing for me
when I wear it as a sports bra but I
laughed a lot so it just says Happy
Holidays you guys get it you like it
yeah I just thought it was funny it very
like when I wear it sometimes I
literally have to like like am I wearing
a bra I don't feel like I'm wearing
anything because it's I mean it has no
no support to it at all so I mean if you
really need a supportive sports bra like
what I have done what I really do want
to wear it is I'll put another sports
bra underneath it and then put this one
on top look if I want to have it in
photos or something that's sometimes
what I'll do because otherwise it
doesn't do much but I just thought it
was cute other t-shirt or I got I know
I've worn it in a video and shown it to
you guys but it's just this like regular
gray tank that says if it's snowing I'm
not going if I'm able I don't know if
I'm able to get that in the full frame
but you had just a very simple gray tank
it's got these like stripes on each of
the sleeves but of course if it's
snowing I'm not going honestly you guys
I really can't be too upset about the
weather I'm hearing that it's supposed
to be 55 degrees here on Christmas which
is crazy we've had I think maybe to snow
storms like we've had up snowfall and
then we did have a pretty big um
snowstorm I think we got like six inches
of snow or something but other than that
our temperatures recently have been very
mild and it's a little confusing a
little confusing another like pretty
basic shirt I picked up is just a I can
get it it's just a long-sleeved shirt
got the long sleeves it is very long in
length but it's a simple like pretty
simple neckline nothing too crazy going
on there and it's just that like
burgundy color that i really like but
again it's just like a big comfy sure
but i'm just around the house and i
don't want to wear a t-shirt because i'm
too cold but i don't want to wear like a
nice sweater or anything like that i can
just have these like casual tanks and i
had a bunch of gift cards one day and i
was able to use all the gift cards at
once for whatever reason i don't think
you normally can and so this ended up
being like it totally free shirt I was
like okay i'll just pick me up a
basically shirt last thing i got our a
pair of leggings and my husband really
thinks these are funny so they're from
the pink line they have the pink band
right here but the material is like the
first shirt that i showed you guys kind
of like the long underwear type and they
even have like the little buttons out
here my husband has like it looks like
you're wearing long underwear which oh
well I thought it was funny and these
can't go over my heels like regular yoga
leggings would and I kind of drives me a
little insane because I just feel like
my feet or so much colder when I can't
put my legs on over them but they are so
small they fit really well other than
their they are not super long in length
they combed about my ankles and then
stuff but they're super comfortable
they're casual they're good for just
like lounging around the house
especially when I were at the black
shirt with it looks like i'm just
lounging but match at the same time he
says everything that i got a my recent
clothing hauls now of course like these
are obviously collective halls i did all
the yoga on black friday shopping but
topple off i know i did one order online
and then
another order no two orders in store and
then victoria secret that's probably
like three or four trips right there
because I go in there quite a bit they
always just have such great coupons and
discounts they have the sticker true
board card was just out not too long ago
and then because I have like the angel
credit card too I am always getting like
fifteen dollars off and then I go in
expecting to get like a pair of
underwear and come out with three shirts
because why not enjoy the hall please to

like a spring haul I could do a spring
