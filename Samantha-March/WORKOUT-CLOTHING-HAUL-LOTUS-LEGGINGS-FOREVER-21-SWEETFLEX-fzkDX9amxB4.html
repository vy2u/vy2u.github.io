today's video we got a little bonus
video this week it is going to be a
workout clothing haul and try on video
so I have been sent as some leggings
from some online companies so I will be
chatting back then I also went to
forever 21 and picked out a few tops for
and myself this is not a sponsored video
by either of these companies to the
companies did send me items to try on
but I am not under any obligation to
make a video and then I purchased the
items that I picked up from forever 21
so if you are interested in seeing a a
workout clothing haul and also try on
and some reviews when we go ahead and
get started so I'm gonna start with a
some leggings and that I was send from
the company Lotus leggings it's an
online company go ahead and leave their
website listed down below really enjoy
wearing workout leggings not only while
I work out but I also wear workout
leggings when I go out so I kind of like
my leggings to not to like I like I'm
gonna have a little bit of to them
you'll see in here I like a lot of like
the sheer panels and things like that I
typically like my leggings to be a
little more high-waisted because
sometimes I'll even wear them out with
like crop tops and things and so when I
was looking at the Lotus leggings
website I found a lot that I was really
attracted to a first up I have the pair
that I've probably been wearing it the
most these are called the monochromatic
splatter Max Air leggings it is the full
name of them and then looking on the
website I believe these are 53.99 it
looks like they're on sale right now for
about $41 Lotus leggings that give me a
code which is a Samantha XL for 20% off
not an affiliate code just made discount
for you if you're interested in using it
so these are what the first leggings all
look like and I really like them they're
nice and high-waisted I notice about the
lotus-like themselves they don't have
much of a stretch to them it's it's it's
decent but it's not a big stretch and
they fit a little bit small all of the
sizes that I picked up a were in a size
small and I'm typically an extra small
to a small in the leggings and I noticed
these being a little bit on the tighter
side so they if you're kind of between
sizes I would say maybe a size up for
them but like lengthwise these go all
the way down to my
ankles and I didn't have any issues with
the length and then I like these because
they have these sheer panels here on
both the legs around the acai section
again are my favorite leggings are from
the bunch I feel like they are really
comfortable but I really like the way
that they look on that they were really
comfortable so I really liked this pair
next pair I have is an all-black pair it
does have some sheer panels here as well
these are called the total blackout
max-flow leggings they're originally
$63.99 it looks like right now they're
on sale on the website for about $41 and
I got these in a size small and again a
little bit of stretch to them but
nothing nothing too crazy here and then
we have the sheer panels a couple
different ones on each of the different
legs so one thing that that made the
splatter lighting is different from I
think it's every other pair that I'm
going to talk about is these have the
Lotus leggings you know kind of like
brand tag right here so when you wear
the pants you know that tag is kind of
like right there invisible and that is
really my biggest complaint about some
of these because I have a pair of
leggings really similar to this and if
you follow me on snapchat and you see me
go like especially to concerts when I go
out I typically I'm wearing my black
sheer leggings that I have from another
brand I wear those out a ton because I
just feel I don't know they're like my
going-out likings I think they're coming
my concert leggings but with these I
actually pulled them out because I was
going to wear them to a concert that I
went to last weekend but I was wearing a
crop top and I just felt like this just
like like sticks out really badly and I
do not like that so the other leggings I
notice have this and at first I was
honestly trying to like peel it off
because I was like what is this sticker
what get no get the sticker off but it's
not a sticker it's actually I mean it's
it's a part of the legging so that to me
is like the worst part that's the thing
that I don't like them both I wish they
were like the other leggings and I'm not
sure why those are different from these
pairs but I don't know I didn't really I
don't really like that so much but for
the actual leggings again I do like them
they are high-waisted which I prefer
they go all the way down to my ankles
and then I like the sheer panels in
there if I'm wearing a bit of a longer
shirt that could maybe cover up
Tagg I feel like I would like it a lot
more I thought might seem like a really
random thing but to me like what I'm
actually going out you know you you
think about what you're wearing from
head to toe and I just I feel like that
is like I don't want to say an eyesore
because I was a little extreme but I
feel like that's kind of like where my
attention goes to when I look at myself
in the mirror I'm seeing that like
sticker on the leggings but other than
that it really did like these ones as
well I have two different camo leggings
to show so these are the first ones
these are called the camel max reveal
leggings they're originally 54.9 right
now they're on sale for forty one
dollars and I like these because they
are the camel print and then they have
the sheer panels here I'm just on this
side but then when you flip them around
kind of a little bit past the knee down
all the way down to the ankle on both
sides you have a sheer panel which i
think is pretty cool eyes I liked that
touch they are high-waisted I do like
that they go all the way down to my
ankles but again this this tag that's
like I don't know might seems like such
a random thing I know but it just really
does bother me these again have a decent
stretch to them at naturally most
stretch and leggings again I'm a size
small they were fitting a little bit
tighter so there is that but I think
these are like my second favorite pair I
would say I've never owned camel
leggings and I actually ended up or
ordering two from this company so I was
pretty excited about that but I like the
way that these fit I like the way they
make my bum look and all that fun stuff
so yeah I think these would be my second
favorite pair from Lotus leggings
they're camel pair I got it's just a
little bit more unlike the regular
stomach these are called the Lotus X
camel leggings and they are originally
70 to 99 and on sale for about fifty
three dollars for these funds I'm not
sure why they are so much more expensive
than the other ones especially because
these ones are just your plain basic
camel print they don't have any of the
sheer panels in them so I'm not sure
about that maybe there's something
different with like the fabric in here
these ones have a little bit more
stretch to them than any of the other
leggings that I tried on so I noticed
that so maybe there's a change with the
fabric that's making them a little bit
on the different side but I did notice
these are probably the stretch iasts
leggings that
I picked up from Lotus leggings it does
have the tag right here as well but nice
and long it goes all the way down into
my ankles and it is high-waisted so I do
like that but I just want another pair
of camel liking so I thought these were
cute these do have a lot of different
styles of camo everything will be linked
down below and like the specific
leggings will be linked these ones had a
lot of different styles and colors of
the camo that you can pick out but I
love I have so many different camo tops
I'm kind of obsessed with it but I don't
have any leggings so now I do and I'm
pretty excited about that and the final
pair I got for my patriotic pair so
these are the star leggings and these
are $49.99 regularly and then $28.99 on
sale right now I just wanted a pair
mostly for like fourth of July I always
think it's cute to go all out patriotic
and I don't have any types of leggings
like this so I thought it could be
really cute around that but otherwise
just having my patriotic leggings I
thought that would be a lot of fun these
aren't the most different that I picked
up from the collection like just the
fabric doesn't feel quite as a secure
all of the other leggings none of them
show through its like any underwear
lines or like when you do squats they're
not any of like the see-through Ness
this is a little bit on the sheer side
like when you squat I feel like you can
see through them a little bit so I don't
think the quality on these ones are as
good as the first four that I showed
it's also not high-waisted and these
seem to run really small these are a
size small as well and I actually have a
lot of troubles like in them completely
on because they are really really tight
so while the other ones I feel like runs
small I feel like this runs like a full
size smaller I would say so there is
that if you're interested in picking
these up I would definitely go a size
bigger because I feel like a medium
would fit me so much better in these but
yeah you know the quality a hundred
percent isn't there on these ones as
compared to the other ones but they're
cute they're patriotic I'll wear them
around the fourth of July and I will be
totally okay with that and you can see
the waistband is a little bit different
as well the waistband is really stretchy
as compared to the other ones but it's
like actual like in the thighs and the
calves it doesn't have as much stretch
as the other four lanes so that I showed
and it does have the tag here as well
though this one is a little bit hidden
these because of the coloring but after
that those are other leggings that I
picked out from Lotus leggings so big
thank you to them for sending those to
me again if you're interested in any of
them
the code for 20% office samantha x so
next up sorry if it's getting really
dark in here it's about to storm i had
to go upstairs grab my ring light out if
you guys didn't hear you don't follow me
on snapchat we're actually repainting my
office this weekend so i've already
taken so much stuff out of my office so
I had to go up give her a ring I'll
bring it down because it's just
insisting on storming again I've did
this next item that I want to talk about
is pretty interesting these are a pair
of leggings that were sent to me from a
sweet flex if you can see here on the
waistband this brand is pretty
interesting because you can probably
tell I don't know if you'd be able to
secret those since its black but on
camera if you can tell that it it almost
kind of like scrunches up here on the
legs and this is really interesting I'm
gonna read a little bit from the website
to try to help tell you about these
leggings because they are the first of
its kind that I now own but they haven't
resistance beyond technology in the
leggings
so it says seamlessly integrated
resistance bands that provide a force
against each step and movement love the
amount of resistance is small each adds
up to big stripes so the point of these
is to almost be like a workout within
your workout or a workout even when
you're not working out you're just
walking around your house type of thing
so they have these resistance bands and
when you pull on the leggings you can
tell like they're very stretchy but they
have resistance bands in here and when I
put these on to be honest they're not
really the most comfortable because it
feels like you have almost like weights
on your legs kind of starting from my
thighs and then down to my calves it
feels similar to when I used to walk on
the treadmill with like ankle weights on
that's kind of what it reminds me of so
I'm super curious about these I've
actually bought shoes that were kind of
similar to this it had like on the heel
of the shoe it was off balance because
it was supposed to help you like I don't
know I'm trying to balance
when you were wearing the shoes I don't
know I bought them because I was into it
like I said I'm really big into working
out and I'm really interested in things
like these um but it's just not the most
comfortable so I wouldn't be able to
really wear these leggings just on like
a casual basis I would really have to be
like okay I'm gonna go you know take
Aries for a walk we'll be gone for a
while why don't I just go ahead and put
these on and kind of give me an extra
boost but these wouldn't be like going
out leggings no I would not be able to
wear these going out but just kind of
casually you know chilling around my
house and things like that I want to
really want to wear these because
they're they're not very comfortable and
you know that might sound kind of
backwards of like maybe they're not
supposed to be comfortable because you
aren't working out and working out isn't
always comfortable so I get that but
it's still just you know isn't my
personal preference but I like the idea
for you know what I'm doing walks or
things like that but they're a little
bit difficult to get into and I actually
find them pretty difficult to get out of
because they make your leg sweat at the
same time so they're they're kind of
difficult to like peel off at the end of
the day I've noticed that but you know
while these won't be like my everyday
leggings that I'll wear like some of
these other ones I'm really interested
in the idea and I like the fact that I'm
kind of getting that extra workout you
know that's why I would put ankle
weights on when I was doing workouts on
my treadmill like walking on my
treadmill so I kind of liked that idea I
just did want to point out that they can
be a little bit challenging to get used
to to get the hang of it first I mean it
definitely just feels like your lower
half is being weighted down but if
you're someone who is interested in
something like this you could you know
check them out I believe they also have
tops as well I think it's a little bit
different because I think it's
considered UK sizing I want to say so I
am in a size six and honestly they're a
bit small on me so I could even go up
but it looks like the full leggings I'm
the ones that go all the way to your
ankles are gonna be $98 they have a
different couple different colors they
also have capris if you're interested in
something like this or you think like
your workout could use a little bit of a
boost one that you you know you're maybe
not even really actively thinking about
you can check out sweet bucks I'll have
the website listed down below it's been
interesting it's been interesting and
getting to know these leggings and
getting on with them but yeah I will
pull them out for my walks and things
like that so next up the last part I'm
just gonna share with you guys what I
picked up from forever 21 um you know I
got sent up quite a few leggings but I
feel like I was kind of lacking in
workout tops and you know just kind of
like casual tops and things like that so
I waned to forever21 I saw Casey Holmes
- a forever 21 like workout video trend
and I thought they had some really cute
stuff so when I was getting my wedding
ring cleaned and inspected and our mall
the other day it's right by forever 21
so I thought hey well let's just see
what they got in there and first up I
picked up this white sweater I was
wearing this in my fall favorites
flashback video I believe it was so it's
just a white sweater and then it kind of
has like the netted three-quarter length
sleeves and it does have a hood I love
this I feel like it's really comfortable
you know it's super casual I love the
sleeves here I think that's something
fun and adds something a bit unique to
way that mine in a size extra small and
I still feel like you know it was pretty
you know kind of bit baggy on me it
wasn't tight in any areas at all it
wasn't tight in the arms so I thought it
was really comfortable and I believe
this one was about 17 18 dollars from
forever 21 and yeah I love this one but
next up I have a little long-sleeved
crop top so this is what this one looks
like it's all black and then kind of in
that lime neon green on the bottom it
says inspire and so it does have the
long sleeves but it is a crop I like the
crop because it's not super tight around
the stomach which I feel like sometimes
can be like unflattering um it's a
little bit looser down there which I
prefer I follow
Daphney Joy on like snapchat and
Instagram she's a model if she my gosh
her workouts
her body like she just Oh - can you draw
those for so many crop tops and like a
lot like a long sleeve crop tops and I
always I think that they are super cute
so I bought this with like her and mind
we look nothing alike
I thought it was super cute I think it
is very flattering on as well this one
was I think it was 10 99 and I got mine
the size extra small it does I got this
sweater it was in the workout section I
don't really know how workout it is um I
got it in a size small and it was a 1790
so it's just a gray long sleeve a
sweater and then it has like this orange
neon tie detail here at the front it was
just super comfortable it's really
casual it's really soft on the inside
like the material inside is really soft
you know it could be good for working
out or honestly just good for kind of
lazing about as our weather is turning a
little bit on the chillier side so I
thought that one was super cute I really
did like it if I know item I got is one
also inspired from definitely joy
because it's kind of a long sleeve a
sweater crop top but this one is so it
is a black and white so it has like this
black detailing all along the sleeves
there that say believe and then it has
the black drawstrings here and it does
have a hood and you know I'll be
inserting the Tran clips as well but it
also is a crop top and I like it again
because just like the other one it's not
super tight it is a little bit looser so
I feel like it looks really cute paired
with leggings I was wearing this other
day and I think in the triumph IDEO I
have it on like that I was wearing the
black and white leggings from Lotus
leggings and then these so I thought the
black and white I thought it was all
like really cute together
and I really enjoyed it again this one
super comfortable and casual I mean even
though it is a crop top if you do wear
it with high waisted leggings which are
the majority of leggings that I on I
really don't even feel like you look
super scandalous or super saucy I mean I
dress saucy so there's that just like
running errands and stuff I don't think
it's a super scandalous or anything so
when I got in an extra-small and it was
in $19.90 would be a final piece that I
picked up from forever 21 okay so that
is everything for my workout clothing
haul in Tryon video I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video or found it
helpful everything that I featured in
this video will of course be listed and
linked down in the description box
really enjoy working out it's something
that I'm very passionate about all of me
on snapchat I share my workouts every
single day of what work on I'm doing I
use the website Brecker and that lists
the grappler website down below that's
what I've been using every single day
for about three or four years now I do
all of my workouts at home I don't have
a gym membership I don't have a trainer
I'd like to have my workout clothing
just be a little bit
more than you know just some sweatpants
are an old t-shirt because kind of just
having a cuter outfit makes me a little
bit more motivated even though I'm not
going anywhere and no one else is seeing
me it helps get me motivated and when
you do a workout from home and you don't
have a class schedule or a trainer
waiting on you you definitely have to
have that self motivation so that is it
for this video I really hope that you
guys enjoyed having a little bonus video
here on Saturday if you want to see more
you know workout or clothing hauls in
general please let me know in the
comments down below but if you guys did
enjoy this video I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and
I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's video
