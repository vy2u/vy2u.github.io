is going to be all about writing I do
want to say first up I'm filming with my
flash on which I normally don't do
because I feel like it just does funny
things with what we got going on and
sometimes I have like red eyes
especially if I look down but it is just
like legit thunderstorm outside which is
kind of weird for october and filming
without the flash just like even weirder
so we're going to go with the flash is
just a little bit less weird than
without the flash so I apologize for the
weird picture that this might be turning
out I wish I could have some sort of
better lighting but I don't so I'm just
gonna have to blind myself by looking
into the splash all video but today's
video is going to be my like tips and
advice for writing so for my authors out
there that watch these videos i hope
this one is helpful to you I've you know
been asking on social media different
videos that you guys want to see and I'm
getting a lot of good feedback
especially from the author's about
writing tips publishing tips marketing
tips you know even things like how to
pitch book bloggers how to make review
files to send out to send out a kindle
in the ePub file how do you make those
files how do you send them to book
bloggers etc I just got an alert on my
computer that it's gonna thunderstorm it
already is thank you for that update
hoping to do maybe one writing author
let's say author focused video a month
so different from like the books the
book reviews the book hauls etc this one
will be focused on my authors so I'm
trying to put together a good video
schedule for that but if you guys have
any questions that you want answered if
you have any video suggestions or ideas
for me please do comment below lost my
train of thought please do comment below
and let me know because I will be
creating that filming schedule for you
guys but again today's video is going to
be like my writing tips and advice and
just some of the things that I follow
how I find that writing works for me
with nanowrimo coming up I think that's
how you say it this is the first time
I'm doing it this year so I'm kind of
excited for it but I thought since that
starts you know November first we're
about there so we'll be like a good kind
of kick off to this series if you want
to call it for videos and hopefully give
some of you guys a little boost for
writing maybe a few ideas if there's any
aspiring writers out there i hope this
video will help you out as well so why
don't we just hop into it hey buzzflash
you guys oh it's going me ok anyway so
one of my first pieces of advice for
writing is to set goals and I think I
talked about setting goals and maybe it
was like the what I do video when I was
kind of explaining all my different jobs
and people were asking about like how I
organized my day I talked about like the
schedules and checklist that I make
that's just kind of the the person I am
I work better when I have something
actually written down or typed up
stating want my goals for the day are
what i want to get done and i can check
them off at the end of the day that just
works really well for me but also a big
thing I mentioned when I talked about
setting your goals or making your to-do
list is to make them realistic for you
so that you don't get overwhelmed by it
you don't get frustrated by it because I
know when I do that and I get
overwhelmed or frustrated it just kind
of causes me to like throw my hands in
the air and give up and that doesn't
help so there are some days when I'm
plotting my schedule that I know I can
get a lot more done so when it comes to
my writing there are days when i'm like
i know that i can write five thousand
words today I you know my dog is at
daycare and I don't have to worry about
her or I'm caught up on all of my emails
so I can take a break from emails right
now to focus only on writing you know
etc there are some days where i'm like i
know i have a dentist appointment today
and i need to run to the grocery store
i'm not going to be able to get that
much done today and my word count goal
for the day will only be like 2,000
words or something like that so it
really you have to really think about
your schedule how much you are actually
able to put into your writing and then
if it's easier for you this is what i do
i write it down and
I write it down on a slip of paper I
have a low note but that's it next sits
next to my desk every day and I write
down my daily to-do list and when I'm in
my writing process which I am in right
now that always includes a word count
for the day so that is a big thing that
works really well for me again does it
work better for you to put your to-do
list in your phone or on your computer
do work but our digital I mean just
whatever works best for you and
especially those goals that work best
for you but I think setting some sort of
goal is really really helpful kind of
going along that same thing another
thing that I wanted to say is just find
out what works best for you and I mean
that not only goal wise word count rise
but what works best for you for like
your writing environment do you write
better do you have like an office a
bedroom of your basement I mean just any
place that you can go to write do write
better in there do you write better on
the fly do you write better sitting on
your couch or at your kitchen table with
a laptop in your lap do you work better
on your laptop on your computer some
people still like to write in notebooks
some authors now I know are doing a lot
of dictation in apps to write their
books I mean whatever it is that works
for you makes that work for you what I
mean by that is so the last book that I
wrote I wrote it on my laptop and I
wanted to be in my office when I wrote
it just worked better for me at that
time to be focused to be in my office to
be in my environment to be writing on my
laptop to have all of my documents going
into the same place that works better
for me I'm now in the writing process a
year 14 months later from my last
writing process and it's actually
different for me now i am writing on my
microsoft surface you might see it it's
the surface that i use to show you guys
like book covers and stuff in my videos
i am writing solely on that and i'm
getting out of my office reason being
when i'm in my office and i'm on my
laptop it's so hard for me to show my
email down it's so hard for me to stay
off social media it's so hard for me to
have facebook messages
meant for me to ignore them when I'm in
my office and I'm in this environment I
am in work mode I want to work I want to
answer emails I want to plan my
marketing I want to respond to people I
want to be tweeting on social media I
want to be talking I mean it just it
does not work well for my writing
environment so for that reason I decided
to work on my microsoft surface and to
get out of my office whether that means
i'm outside in the nicer months i would
sit on our table outside my dog would
just go play in the yard I would sit at
the table and write or a lot of times
now I'm just going up to my bedroom
sometimes I'm writing just at the
kitchen counter I mean just wherever it
is that's not in my office because it
might sound backwards but me being in my
work environment is not good for my
actual writing but again you need to
find what works best for you when I
first started writing this book which is
my fifth book I started in my office on
my laptop and I quickly realized I'm not
getting enough done I'm not meeting my
goals I'm not allowing myself to only
focus on my writing I think that is a
really big thing when it comes to like
this kind of like tip or piece of advice
is that you need to be focused when
you're writing you need to not be
thinking about all your other different
distractions that you have going on so
that's a big piece that I've learned for
me and again it just you have to kind of
be flexible with yourself oh yeah that's
another piece of advice I have for
writing tip that I have it's not so much
focused on writing but kind of like your
writing process is to find different
groups or different authors critique
partners etc just to be able to have an
outlet I belong to a few different
author groups on Facebook and they just
really help they have you know we can
enter into discussions we can help each
other we can ask each other questions we
can give each other support and
encouragement you know when someone is
feeling down about they're not hitting
their word count they don't think
they're going to make their goal or even
something post writing you know
post-publication they got a bad review
or you know something like that we can
all kind of band together cheer each
other up I think it's really important
to have your critique partners and your
either someone to read early drafts of
your book to be able to give you
feedback so you can go in and rework
even before you send to an editor I
think these are really helpful to be
able to get early feedback so you can
see how readers are taking to your story
so then you can rework it before you
even enter into your editing process I
think that is a really good thing to do
a piece of advice here is just so to
find other people whether it be a group
whether it be just one or two other
people whether it be via social media
and maybe people that you're never going
to meet whether it's your next-door
neighbor who really likes writing and
offers to you know take a look at your
manuscripts for you that can really help
your writing processes do have another
sounding board especially with
like-minded people it's been something
that has helped me tremendously over the
past year to another writing tip that I
truly think is really important and this
is just this is me again you know all
these tips are just things that i have
found beneficial to me you guys could
very well be the opposite but i just
want to share some of mine and my big
thing is that when i'm in the writing
process is to not over edit while I'm
writing and what I mean by that is I
usually write by chapter so i will write
a chapter and then i will go back and
look it over if anything sticks out to
me you know obviously the red squiggly
line under microsoft word that I've
spelled a word wrong things like that I
will go ahead and change but I won't
really do a hard self-edit at that time
because then it distracts you from your
writing and then I just have too much
going on when I'm trying to edit it
while I'm actually writing it's just too
hard for me and then I get distracted
from writing and then I get falling back
on writing and then I'm not meeting my
writing goals and then i'm not writing
and then i'm frustrated and it's like a
whole domino effect so I do like a very
small like proofread when i read over
the chapter but i don't really get into
the editing a lot of times what i'll do
is i'll make notes so i know in chapter
2 i wrote something and then in chapter
8 i wrote something that contradicts
what I wrote in chapter 2 then my mind
is okay do I change what happened
chapter to do i change what happen in
chapter 8 do i keep going and see if
maybe something is going to change that
storyline I don't want to go back and
edit and start to fix pieces that just
doesn't work for me so instead I keep a
notebook for whenever it is i'm writing
i keep a notebook by me and i will jot
notes in there so i will just jot a note
that says doesn't charge or do this in
chapter 8 it doesn't line up something
that I need to go back and check over
when i'm done with my first draft so
that's a tip that really helps keep me
on track and instead of getting focused
into other areas of the book i just get
that first draft out it feels so good
once you have that first draft written
sure then sometimes you have to go in
and rewrite a lot and you know you start
a plot points in the beginning and then
they fizzled out and didn't go anywhere
and so you need to edit in rewrite etc
but at least you have that first draft
written another piece of advice that I
would probably give is along the same
lines of like finding what works for you
how you write when you right where you
white where you write etc is to figure
out what your writing style is for me
personally i right chapter-by-chapter i
start a chapter one and boom boom boom i
keep going a reason why i do this is
because i'm not a big outliner i find it
really hard to outline an entire book
being like chapter one this happens
chapter 2 this happens chapter 3 this
happens because when i start writing my
characters take on a life of their own
they do their own things they have
things that pop up that i didn't even
know was you know somewhere in my brain
and it's just too hard for me to outline
because then something will happen but
it's not in my outline then do i change
my outline than do it it just is too
complicated so I know my characters I
know my main characters I know my
secondary characters I know the point of
why I'm writing I know the beginning the
ending I know you know the peak but I
don't know all what happens in between I
let my characters work that out for
themselves while I'm in the writing
process so that is why i right boom boom
boom one two three four keep on going
because my story is being created as am
writing if that makes any sense but I
know that there are several writers that
write by scenes you know they write a
scene that will appear at the end of the
book they write that first you know it
just depends on and they don't write a
full chapter they literally just write a
scene that could probably be two pages
or something versus the whole chapter
and that's how they piece their story
together also I know people that are
firm outliners I know what happens
during every single point of their book
they have all of that plotted out and
then all they have to do is write the
story I mean everyone is so different so
you need to find what works best for you
and again be open to is that going to
change as you're writing there was one
book um it was the green ticket my
segment book when I wrote it I actually
wrote a few scenes like the scene that
explains basically why the title is the
green ticket that was the first scene
that I thought of before I even wrote
the book and so instead of starting the
writing process and just trying to
figure out where that scene worked into
I wrote that scene ahead of time so it
was already there is the very first
thing i wrote i just saved it in a
folder and i was able to insert it at
some point when i came to that point of
the book so does that make any sense I
don't know like these are so hard to
talk about because I don't know if they
make any sense because everyone is so
different at the writing routine but
again I just wanted to give you some
tips and advice that I find work for
myself because maybe they will work for
you biggest thing that I keep saying
over and over and over is that you find
what works for you and your life will be
a whole lot easier I swear another piece
of advice that I have to give and one
that I honestly think I could do better
at myself is to being open to change or
being open to using different apps or
websites etc to help your writing I just
recently got introduced to Evernote and
I will leave it in a link below and
basically it's just like a web-based
program I'm very new to it I have not
fully delved into it yet but it's a
web-based program you can put no
there you can do screen captures in
there you can have different folders and
notebooks right in this website it can
connect to your phone you can type on
the go like if I'm out I could type a
scene on Evernote and then it'll show up
on my web based like on my desktop as
well and I can copy it and paste it and
put a whole scene into my book I think
it's really great i've been using it for
a few different reasons so far but also
a big thing with that is that you can
actually do dictation on the app so if i
just press like the microphone button on
my phone with evernote opened i can
speak a scene into my phone it'll
capture it it'll save it to evernote
then I can come on my laptop I can open
the website i can copy and paste and put
that into my book that is a really big
deal for me for someone who is on the go
a lot i also i struggle really bad with
like wrist problems because i'm on a
laptop so much and you know I always
have my hands I when I wrist brace I
have like a wrist protector on my laptop
but it is really hard for me to write
for long periods of times because I find
my wrists are hurting so bad so this
I've only been using it for like a week
but it has really helped me and it's
been a time-saver of course it's kind of
hard to get used to especially talking
into your phone I have an Android so I
can't do things like I can't say quotes
and they'll put actual like dialogue
quotes in for me so I have to go back
and add those in but it is saving me
quite a bit of time and I can talk in my
car I can talk well I'm like taking off
my makeup it just it really has been
helping me but at first I won't say at
first I mean I'll say a while ago people
would be like oh you know I have this
app and it really helps me or I use I
can't think of what it's how to
pronounce its grind screen driver screen
driver I'm not sure how to pronounce it
but i'll link that below as well that i
know a lot of different authors use and
I'm just like no I don't want to change
I don't want to learn new programs I
don't want a blah blah blah but
seriously I need to be better and to
open myself up more when I heard about
this Evernote I was like nope I don't
want to look into it and it was like
five minutes
that I was like Samantha get it together
just look and see what it is see if it
will help you and it has really helped
me not even with writing but i'm using
their notes and notebooks for even
different purposes from writing so it
just says really starting to help me
especially that it can connect with my
phone that's such a big deal to me and i
really like having a web-based program
because then you know with microsoft
word and things like that then it's
stuck on my laptop and sure i can email
that file to my email and then i can
open it from everywhere but that's just
frustrating this is so easy that i can
put my chapters right in there and then
no matter where it is that i'm working
if i can get on the internet i can
access that i can type new scenes right
in there it's so good so basically my
piece of advice is don't be afraid of
change like I am I know I am and if you
hear other authors you know give good
ideas about different websites apps
tools to be able to help you out try to
go for it just listen to it look and do
it see if it'll help you not saying
everything will help you but could be a
good thing or two out there and then to
wrap this video up I really hope this
quality turns out ok cuz I don't really
want to re-record this video's kind of
oh I feel like I'm talking fast I'm like
losing my breath but hopefully it turns
out ok but my last piece of advice for
your writing process if you're a writer
a new writer and older writer not
age-wise of course but my biggest piece
of advice is to write and I feel like
everyone says that and I feel like
people get mad when they say like do you
have any tips or advice for writers and
a lot of people will say yeah right but
it honestly is the biggest thing because
I can't tell you how many people have
said to me you know i really want to be
an author or I have an idea for a book
but I just don't have time to write I
don't have time you know I have a family
I have I work two jobs I do this in my
spare time you know I just I just don't
have any time to write if you really
want to write you will write and I'm not
saying that you need to write a
masterpiece on your first one
saying that you have to be perfect and
great and you always need to write words
that matter but even if you just write a
little bit if you write a hundred words
a day that's a hundred more words then
if you didn't write anything at all it
might take you years to finish your
manuscript because you're so busy
because you have a life because you have
a job because you have other
responsibilities and demands in your
life but if you write a little every
single day eventually your manuscript
will be finished and you know what a
great accomplishment will that be if
that's something that you really feel
passionate about in your life you have
to do it so even though that might sound
like the most cliche thing in the world
that truly is my biggest biggest piece
of advice for someone who wants to write
put your pen to paper put your fingers
on your keyboard just right get those
words out there it'll eventually all
come to you guys I'm gonna stop
chattering your ear up and I don't even
know if this video makes sense because i
would start saying something i think
about something else and there's just so
many things that i feel like i could say
i'm writing again my biggest one is just
going to be if you want to write you
need to write those words down you need
to speak those words you need to get
those words out there my biggest biggest
piece of advice nanowrimo is coming up
in the month of November we're basically
your goal in November is to write fifty
thousand words I am honestly super
nervous to take this challenge on I've
never given myself a challenge like this
the point of nanowrimo is to write a
novel in one month I 50,000 words is you
know pretty close to a full-length novel
that I would write usually minor around
like 70 to 80 thousand words but I'm
excited there's a lot of great groups
out there groups that I've joined other
authors that I know that are doing it
that we can offer up encouragement and
support it's it will be the biggest
writing goal I have ever given myself so
I'm very nervous to take the song and
now I'm putting it out there for
everyone everyone knows that i'm doing
it i'm super-nervous I don't want to
fail but I'm gonna do my best and see
what happens so I just kind of thought
this video could come at a good time not
only to hopefully inspire or boost some
of you guys but I'll
so for myself to like I need to come
back I need to remember my own advice to
myself I need to remember what works for
me I need to remember to be open to
change and I need to remember to write I
get really disappointed at myself on
days where I don't write anything down
where i'm like i just had too much going
on i had to run all these errands and
then my husband needed me to do this and
then my friends wanted me to do that and
then I'm trying to do this over here and
finish this project and like no I need
to remember that I need to write every
day because nothing helps get my novel
finish faster then if I actually write
it but anyways like i said i hope this
video was helpful to you if it was
please do give it a thumbs up please
subscribe before you go authors if you
have any other videos suggestions or
ideas for me please do comment below and
let me know if you guys have any other
specific questions to this video again

happy to answer any questions that you
might have to the best of my abilities
thank you so much for watching I'm going
to sit here in the thunderstorm by
myself turn the splash off and hopefully
