channel so today's video is going to be
a makeup tutorial on this bowl right
here but it's a little bit different of
a makeup tutorial than I've done because
it's going to be using a lot of new
products some new products in general
like to the drugstore and that sort of
thing but some just new products to me
that I have recently picked up so I'm
very excited I came up with just like my
brown shimmer I but very wearable no
fake lashes no big wing and so hopefully
you find it to be a little bit of like a
wearable brown shimmer I if you can tell
I'm trying to think of like what I'm
going to title this video and I'm like
playing it off like yeah that's probably
a good thing to title this video right
but I'm excited for it I have a lot of
new products that I used in here from
basically everything on my eyes to a
blush that I absolutely ended up falling
in love with my lip color is new as well
so yeah very excited so why don't we
gently I'm going to start with my eyes
first because i'm going to use a shimmer
shadow i basically start with the eyes
forever look that way if there's any
sort of fallout with shimmer glitters
dark shadows anything like that it's not
falling onto our already made up face
and you're not wiping away foundation or
anything like that so typically always
start with the eyes I did prime my eyes
before hopping on camera just with a
little bit of concealer like I normally
do but the first thing I'm going to go
in with is this mood struck addiction
shadow palette this is from unique and
so the inside of it looks like it does
have a mirror right here and then it has
these shades there's a few Matt there's
a few shimmer there's lighter shades
darker shades these pretty shimmer
shades right here after that I know her
name is Farrell Torres she recently must
have started selling unique I'm not
super familiar with the unique brand I
don't own anything from them so far
message me one day and asked if she
could send me a few items and maybe I
could put together our makeup look with
him and I said yes and so I picked out
this palette I think there was three
different palettes to choose from there
forty nine dollars
which I thought was a little bit on the
expensive side for a palette but the
shades do look really nice like I said
I've used a few different looks with
them I didn't want to try them out first
I could give a little bit of feedback I
do really like the shimmer shades
because I just like the shimmer look on
the lids I think it looked very pretty
there isn't a lot of fallout when I put
the shadows on but I noticed throughout
the day of the fallout is there but the
matte shades are really nice as well so
it's a nice balanced palette and thank
you so much to Farrell for sending a few
of these products I'm very excited to
try them out I will leave links below to
everything that i'm using of course
throughout the entire makeup tutorial
and I'll also leave Pharaohs link below
if you are interested in purchasing
anything she can help you out with that
I think unique is like they have
different I don't know what you call on
what you called them but I can leave her
link below because she sent that to me
I'm not getting paid for this rell
didn't pay me for it I'm not gonna get
paid if you guys buy anything it's just
a friend that sent me some makeup and
asked me to try it out and I said yes
because I'm all about supporting my
friends I feel the beauty lovers and my
fellow authors and just women in general
you go girl but the first day that I'm
going to come in with is ill ate it and
I'm just going to use like a flat shader
brush it's just a like matt white shade
and I'm just going to put this all over
my lid guys mentioned i did prime I I
and then I usually come in with some
sort of just really light matte shade
and dust it underneath my eyebrow and
then along my lid to kind of seal in the
cream primer that I used next I'm going
to grab my more free em 433 brush it's
just a blending brush or the crease I'm
going to come in with this chipper shade
just a really pretty brown shade it is a
little bit of a deeper crease shade than
i would normally use but i think it
works really well there isn't anything
else lighter in the palette but i'm
using the darker shimmer shade so I feel
like the star
your color will work for it and I'm just
going to blend that into my crease just
going back and forth in windshield wiper
motions and then as I have less product
on the brush kind of blend upwards and
outwards as well I do it when I have the
less product on the brush brush because
if you have a lot of product and you're
like sweeping out here or sleeping up
you're honestly going to be depositing
more product there and that doesn't help
get the blended gradient look that we're
always after usually like to tap off my
brush as well so you don't have a lot of
excess powder on the brush so the next
thing I'm going to pick up is this
swanky or right here and I'm just going
to use a flat shader brush and pick up
swanky it's this really pretty shimmery
color and I just think that is so so
pretty it's it's like a shimmer color
but it's nothing like too overwhelming I
don't think I feel like you could even
get away with this as like a a daytime
look if you want to do anything like
super crazy with your liner or lashes it
could be a pretty day time look
obviously if you do like massive lashes
and a huge win liner and like bold lips
I mean that's probably more of your
nighttime look but this could even be
like an easy like day-to-night
transition like do this during the day a
little bit of liner maybe a nude lip and
then at night just add some liner add
some lashes change your lip color maybe
put some heels on and you are ready to
go what's going to use the brassy shade
because it's a really pretty peach
shimmer shade and it's going to do a
peach luck but if you follow me on
snapchat or Instagram you saw that i
purchased the two-phase sweet peach
pellets
the other day so i'll be doing a couple
peach spring makeup looks with that baby
he hand I'm so excited I went to Alta at
10am the day that I was in store it was
the second one in there and there was
only 20 pallets because I tried to pick
one up for a giveaway and the lady was
like we're limiting them to want because
we only got 20 in store I'm like 20 you
only got 20 pallets in here crazy I'm
going to pick up my morphe m4 for one
brush again it's a blending brush but
it's a little bit longer than the 443
that I was just using and I'm going to
come in and grab forthright the second
one here it is a dark matte Brown and
I'm just going to put a little bit on
the brush and really make sure I tap it
off and I'm just going to lightly put
that in my outer V like a very light
like hardly using any pressure and just
kind of defining the outer V just
slightly and when I have a less product
now push the brush toward the inner
corner of my eye again very light
especially when you're working with such
a dark shade like this light strokes is
your friend and I don't feel like this I
truly makes a huge huge difference like
if you get a skip this stuff you go
ahead and skip this step there are so
many times that I just love putting a
little bit of darkness and the outer be
and sweeping it in just slightly I do it
in somebody makeup looks so again a
little bit of product tap it off very
lightly in the outer V and I usually
like tap tap tap at first and outer V
and then start to sleep because if you
immediately go in and start sweeping and
you
a lot of product on there you can be
making a mess and what steps finished
I'm going to come in with the most drug
precision a liquid eyeliner is what it
looks like and I picked up the shade
prof prosper proper proper it's a brown
shade and I just don't have any brown
liquid liners that guy just have black
ones so I thought I would get a brown
and especially because I thought it
would complement this palette pretty
well and I'm just going to make a really
basic small wing and all will see that's
what I always tell myself and then you
started and it's like oh Lord and I'm
trying to this on camera too but I'm
just going to draw a line on my top lash
and then hopefully make a little wing
oh yeah little wing ok so my camera
started to overheat so I just finished
the other wing off camera but again like
I said just really simple basic wings
that's really proud of myself that I
actually did it for the liquid eyeliner
pen I did find it very user-friendly I'm
not super fantastic yet at a liquid
eyeliner but I found the pen to be very
easy to work with the color goes I don't
think that they're very pigmented and I
fade quickly throughout the day and it
to be a good like everyday eyeliner pen
like and when I say every day I mean
like if I'm just going to be chillin on
the house running errands like I want a
little bit of makeup on but I don't need
anything like to flash you too crazy to
stay on all night I'm going to be out
till 2i am a kind of eyeliner I can go
with that and I do like to have those
eyeliners in my collection because you
know when you're going out you're going
to a special event and you usually have
like your your special eyeliners and
your special make-up your special
primary source special highlighters that
you go for but you don't want to use
those on like a regular day and just so
you have your other eye liners that's
what I would classify this one asked
just because I don't flick the color
we're like really pops and like I said
it does fate easily throughout the day
but they have a lot of different colors
as well and I can't remember the price
point for it now but I can put that in
the description box below in case you
were interested we I just popped off off
camera finished the other eye and then I
will go on and finish my eyes that later
but I'm going to move to my face right
now and I'm going to come in first with
the tart clean slate timeless smoothing
primer looks like this and I'm just
going to put this on to my face like
this rub it in I'm like obsessed with
this primer and it smells so good like
it just I feel like it's like making my
face clean even though that makes no
sense and that's you know it's not what
a primer really does but I just love the
smell of it i have just like a little
deluxe sample that i got for free with
my with a recent tart purchased a monk
probably going to need some more of that
then for foundation I'm going to use the
l'oreal true
Lumi foundation and i'm going to apply
that to my face using the morphe 439 one
of my favorite foundation brushes I like
this foundation it is drugstore it is
affordable it's not new as a pump which
I really like and it does make your skin
look more luminous and healthy so to set
the foundation I'm going to use the
Maybelline master fix their setting and
perfecting a loose powder looks like
this this is fairly new from the
drugstore I'm going to use a more feet
III and I'm going to dust that all over
my face this is actually going to be the
very first time that I'm trying this out
I'm really curious about this I do have
the it really is the first time i have
to take the plastic off don't mind me I
don't really have a powder like a loose
powder like this that i use for all over
my face so curious to try this I've
heard good things about it i have the
laura mercier secret brightening powder
but that is more for my address right in
the pub not really for my face I'll be
able to give you some like first
impression feedback right here but as
long as but for like how it lasts was
going to swirl at all in my face to set
it feels weird I've really never done
this before and I'm really curious about
like a white cast in photography so I
have to try to take pictures and let you
guys know what I think and that you guys
know how I feel like it held up with my
foundation so I don't know give it a try
if you guys have tried this and you have
any opinions about it please leave them
in the comments below I of course would
love to know concealer let me use the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm going to
buff that in with the more Fuji to then
i'm going to set it with the wet and
wild contouring palette and my ELF small
tapered brush none of these are new
products so I'm not going to really talk
through this part since this is
basically what i do in every tutorial
tell the sweater is driving me crazy
like every time I wear it I'm like why I
wear the sweater again like it
constantly falls down on my shoulders
which sometimes I like to look and
sometimes I'm like girl get it to get
there I'm going to go back to my eyes
and I'm going to use a new product this
is from Maybelline is there master
precise skinny gel pencil this is what
it looks like it's like super super tiny
and I don't know I was just at CVS the
other day I Mabley was having a sale and
I have done it that's what the tip looks
like like it's tiny I doubt you can see
it and I actually didn't realize it was
a gel pencil I'm literally just
realizing that for the first time this
is going to be the third time I've used
it I go ahead and put that into my
waterline and it makes so much more
sense now that it's a gel pencil because
I cannot get over how like smoothly it
applied but it's also very very
pigmented like I was very impressed at
this little guy I haven't used it yet
probably trying to create a wing and
that's what they say it's like so
awesome for because it's so skinny I've
been traded out for that yet but I
thought it would work pretty well
then I'm going to go back to the
addiction palette and I'm going to take
this last color that I just stuck my
finger nail in I'm going to take the
zealous which is right here I'm going to
take it on this a more feet a 36 brush
and I'm just going to tap a little bit
on here this is a really dark brown but
it has a little bit of shimmer to it I
thought it would be really pretty too
just both on the lower lash line and
give a little bit of drama to the eyes
again if you're doing this for like a
daytime look maybe skip this part until
you're ready to do with the nighttime
look because it does add some drama to
it I just thought it was really pretty
in it it's got some shimmer to it but
it's not like overwhelming shimmer like
it's not swanky or brassy type of shower
but a little bit to get you going and
then for the mascara which is the last
product that I have from unique to try
so they have a new moodstruck 3d fiber
lash system it was actually not aware of
this and you guys are gonna think I'm a
total blonde but I've actually emailed
fro Farrell and was like the mascara
sent me is empty so what should we do
about that she's like no it's supposed
to be it's fiber so I'm like dang it she
thinks she I'm sure she thinks I'm just
like super blonde now but basically what
you do first is you put on this
transplanting gel and it looks basically
like a regular mascara wand this is what
it looks like and you want to coat the
lashes really really good and this is
actually what the 3d fibers are going to
stick to and they say that the 3d fibers
are supposed to be like having false
lashes on so this is going to be the
first time that I'm trying this out so
we're going to do this to get there so
they say to coat the lashes really
really well with the transplanting gel
so this is gonna be step one actually it
didn't even ask if you're supposed to do
this on your bottom lashes I just assume
your system on the bottom lashes I don't
know I could be wrong I feel like I
watched a video and I feel like all she
did was their top
ashes now i can't remember she ate it
our bottom lashes excellent I've never
tried anything like this i'm super duper
curious I've seen pictures and they look
pretty darn good I feel like maybe like
the only downfall of this would be that
it seems pretty time consuming you know
if you got to put the transplanting gel
on then the fibers oh and then after you
put the fibers on you do the
transplanting gel again you're supposed
to do it Walt still wet some like trying
to do this fast so I don't know and
you're supposed to like coat I'm really
good so the fibers stick to it Oh Lord
took myself in the face so I don't know
maybe like the time part could be a
downfall but then again if you don't
have to worry about glue and adhesive
and stick myself again if you guys ever
do like get mascara on you like I did
just wait till it's dry and then just
little flake right off wait till it's
dry do not try to take off what mascara
so you guys are going to see that for a
little bit but don't take off what
mascara okay and can you see what I
don't know if you guys can tell but this
is like totally dry like it looked like
felt was on it and I was like I'm super
duper confused here and then they said
once you do this you're supposed to
start because this is why I think I'm
not supposed to do it on the bottom
lashes you're supposed to start like
halfway and go up you're not so so
stirred it like the base of your lashes
halfway and up
you guys can you guys see any fibers
close on my lashes are they getting
longer
i think i am going to leave my bottom
lashes alone because if this is supposed
to be like fake eyelashes I don't do
lashes on my bottom lashes so we'll just
we'll just see the bottom lashes alone
for a little bit the transplanting gel
is almost kind of like a mascara so
that's just a little roll with like I
feel like something is happening but I
feel like I'm also getting like fall out
around my eyes can you guys see the fall
out or the other I'm and i'll zoom you
guys in well hello welcome to my eye
good so I don't know there's like big
clumps on here
you like the size doing a little better
but there's also like I don't know it's
a clumpy and I keep like wiping it on my
hand because the video that i watch it
was like if you see big clumps just wipe
it on your hand but I don't think
they're really going anywhere oh I don't
know I'm gonna put the transplanting gel
on and then see ready ok so I did come
back in and put the transplanting gel on
top which is what you're supposed to do
the gel the fibers and the gel again to
seal the fibers into place I don't know
i I don't I don't know I kind of had
like a lot of fibers all over my face
and I Cano to work to to get them off
but i'm not sure i don't really think it
made my lashes look any bigger but i
don't know i'll for again I feel like
like I'm doing something wrong or maybe
it's because I'm on camera and I'm
trying to hold a mirror and do it at the
same time definitely i'm going to try it
again though i can let you guys know in
future videos if I found it easier to
use I did want to do like a first
impressions and that's what I was doing
but maybe that wasn't the best thing
with something so new to me but I don't
know I I like the idea of it and i've
seen other people use it now I've seen
videos of people using it I've seen
pictures of people using it and it
seemed to work really well for them so i
don't know i can keep working at it and
keep trying if anyone has used it or if
you have any tips please let's leave
those in the comments below because i'd
love to hear them for you because i
think this would be a really nice like
everyday type of mascara to go for like
if you're getting the fake lashes look
and you're you know putting the time and
effort into your lashes but you don't
have to mess with adhesive or glue or
lashes starting to fall off offer your
lashes aren't you know lined up or
things like that i think it would be a
really good alternative so I'll keep
trying I'll let you guys know I think
you guys let me know if you have used it
but I'm going to finish up with a
tutorial now I'm going to come in with
another new product this is from
Wet'n'Wild it's their color I con hambre
blah
Shh I got this from target and I got it
in the color might I buy you a drink so
hombre blushes seem to be pretty big
right now this is what it looks like I
just thought it was a beautiful like
peachy orange I'm so into the peach
right now if you guys can tell it's
later up top and darker on the bottom so
i guess i'm going to swirl the two
together and see what I get out of it
because that's how I want to use it so
I'm going to use the morphe em 427 brush
it's a really nice duo fiber blush brush
so going to swirl it on here well that's
actually robe it pretty for I just did a
few quick swipes and I'm just like
putting all the product together some
people would do like darker in the back
and lighter in the front I'm just going
to scroll them together for this first
time and see what I get I think that's
really pretty you guys see that like
could you glow oh I like this one wild I
feel like it's just really doing good
things right now I'm impressed with them
the contouring palette that I used I
think it's an absolute staple like you
guys need to have that i also got their
glitters I'm going to do a tutorial
coming up soon doing a glitter I using
the wet'n'wild glitters I have a good
experience with them a lot of people are
not having great experiences with them I
had a good experience with it so I'm
gonna do a tutorial not sure when I'm
gonna do it yet but that will be coming
up oh I think that is so pretty ooh okay
is that showing up okay on camera I hope
so cuz this is just like I just want to
keep putting it on it kind of Moran's me
a little bit of luminoso from Milani
move very happy with this blush for
highlighter i'm just going to be basic
i'm just using from becca and Jacqueline
helmet of champagne pop the brush is new
to me it's the more feet and the 501
it's like what everybody is our beauty
guru uses for highlight I just bought it
it will be doing a more food halls
soon because mama got herself a 350
pilot yes I'm going crazy with eyeshadow
palette slightly I do a couple halls
he'll hear coming up guess who's going
on a know by this girl I feel like this
is such a gorgeous highlight paired with
that blush oh oh yes put a little down
the bridge of my nose hello right on the
tip of my nose such a pretty glowy look
in the shimmer eyes I'm really liking
the way this turned out for my lip color
I do have another new product this is
from the knicks a lingerie line this is
what it looks like so next came out with
several several nude liquid lip shades
this one is in a ruffle trim I picked up
to for myself ruffle trim what did I
have on yesterday I had something on
yesterday and it's beautiful I can
insert a picture in here of it because I
felt like I got a really good lip
picture of it and I just thought it was
so pretty so I'm just going to fly
realize that the shade yesterday like I
think these colors are gorgeous I do
come in with two coats and because it's
a liquid lipstick you want to do it
fairly quickly you don't want to let it
dry and then try to come in and do
another coat pretty color this is what
the applicator looks like it's very long
very flat it reminds me of the tart
TARDIS bullet paint applicator if anyone
is familiar with that but is what I
would compare it to it's very easy to
apply very smooth what's going on
can you see from the top left to the
bottom lip like why I want two coats you
guys can you see the friends though yeah
definitely why I want two coats I really
really like this color this is so pretty
I wore the other color all day yesterday
and I thought it wore pretty well I it
faded a little bit especially after I
ate dinner but it hung on pretty well I
was happy with it I have watched a lot
of videos about these because not only
was i buying some for myself but I
bought some from my purse will be monday
winner on instagram your Joy's don't
follow me on instagram i do a monthly
giveaway for a lipstick you just have to
share a lipstick photo one time during
the month you can enter up to four times
on a monday and one winner is chosen at
the end and i wanted to do one of these
for my winner but so I was watching all
these different videos to make sure they
were actually like a decent product and
the majority of people said a lot of
different ones in the collection are not
very opaque or crumble right away or
very like sheer on the lips but they're
like it seemed like everybody I was
watching had a handful of colors that
they said was really good and that's the
colors that I picked up cuz I was like
well if everyone is saying like these
specific colors are really really good
then I should get them one I got pedi
for the winter and then I was going to
pick up exotic and it was actually sold
out so I was like well exotic must be a
good one as well but the two that i have
i mean i'll wear this throughout the day
and let you guys know for sure follow me
on snapchat i do a lot of updates on
snapchat just to make that march but so
far i was really happy with the one that
i wore yesterday so i can see how this
one goes but i think the color is really
pretty little pretty and then to finish
this off i'm just going to spray my face
with the mario badescu facial spray with
l herbs and rosewater this is a new
purchase as well i got this from ulta
when they were doing the 21 days of
beauty because the whole Mario Badescu

with doing liner and winged eyeliner
that i found was very very easy to use
i'm going to keep trying on the mascara

because i just i don't feel like i got a
very good handle on it today but I'll
keep trying it out and see what I can
come up with the blush from wet and wild
I'm obsessed with it I am like obsessed
with it right now the Maybelline eye
liner I thought worked really well I was
very happy with that and so far the next
lingerie lipsticks the shades that I
have I am really loving I really do like
this color the shade I tried yesterday
was more of a pink nude and this is like
a little bit more of a darker nude but I
really really like it is that everything
that I tried for new products I'll let
you guys know about the Maybelline
setting powder because I haven't really
been able to experience yet I just put
my makeup on but definitely I can't let
you guys know the Mario Badescu spray

grabbing for it and really enjoying that
