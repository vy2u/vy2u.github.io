of in a more casual mode I got my I
don't know if you can see it muscles and
mascara shirt on one of my favorite
shirts cuz I feel like it sums me up
pretty well it'd be a more casual today
and I just wanted to answer a question
that I get asked a lot and I thought
maybe I could make a full video out of
it
I still I'll try to make it a short
video I'm such a Rambler and I don't
know how to like cut myself yet in
videos and clip myself out I'm trying
but I thought I might do a Q&amp;amp;A in the
next coming weeks because I get asked a
lot of like questions that it won't take
me as long the answer so I thought I
could compile a bunch of the questions
that I'm getting and just do one Q&amp;amp;A
video so if you do have any questions
for me on anything that I do or my
personal life or my dog because I know
you all love her and seeing her pictures
or my books and my website I don't care
any questions that you have for me leave
them below ask me on social media I'm
trying to say ever write down as many or
screenshot any of the questions that I'm
getting so far so hopefully I can put
together a good Q&amp;amp;A video for you in the
coming weeks but this video I wanted to
touch on why I started my blog because I
get that question you know kind of all
the time how'd you get started or when I
tell people that I'm an author they ask
how I got started and I really credit my
book blog for that and the interviews I
have it's usually always a question on
there so I've answered it several times
but I thought it would be fun to kind of
sit down and talk to you guys and give
you kind of my reasoning my backstory my
thought process on it it was 2009 that I
started chiclet plus and was in October
is our anniversary date we just did five
years last year we celebrated it with a
big giveaway with a bunch of authors and
other bloggers and it was a lot of fun
but so a little bit more of a back story
I have always known I wanted to be an
author I can actually that
like a whole other story in itself so I
can maybe do a video on that sometime
but literally since I was nine years old
I've known that I wanted to write books
and my thought process was it's really
hard to be an author you know you have
to be so talented you have to also be
lucky you have to maybe have connections
I feel like if I go to college for it it
might not work out and then what do I do
so in high school I thought go to a real
school and get your rail degree and if
you still have this you know far-fetched
idea that one day you can be an author
then you can pursue it after you have
your degree so that's what I did I went
to a business college I got my my
bachelor's degree I also met my husband
there so good thought playing Sam so
that was good but it was my was it right
before I graduated it was maybe a few no
it was my last year of college and so my
fourth year and you know I still was
like I really want to do something with
writing what can I do I actually read
the book Something Borrowed by Emily
Giffen obviously I love that book
obviously I love Emily Giffen I've
actually interviewed her over the phone
one time and it was like the total
fangirl moment of my life
it was awful I'll get into that another
video too but I read her book and I was
just so inspired and I was so inspired
to do something more and I thought you
know I don't have to wait until I get
that diploma or that degree like let's
start something now blogging was really
big in 2009 it was really catching on
really gaining popularity and so I
thought why not give it a shot why not
start a book blog it's kind of the same
thing with YouTube
YouTube's really popular why not give it
a shot and just see what happens and I
started looking at different book blogs
seeing what people were talking about
seeing what people were writing about
seeing how their blogs looked and then I
thought okay I can do this I'd love to
talk about books
I love reading books you know I read all
the time you know I've always read all
the time there's
you will never ask me what are you
reading and I say oh nothing right now I
don't even know that means how do you
not read a book
it's just crazy that's just that's just
what I do so I thought why not take this
passion something that I do every day
and be able to talk about it and you
know let's maybe something will happen
out of it and then came the part of
actually getting my blog and you guys
know and I'm not very good at tech stuff
so I thought how in the world do you
even create a blog how do you make a
page how do you put an image up so I
hired someone to do it for me and she's
not business anymore office I would
totally give you her information because
not only did she build me this beautiful
website and Chiklis has changed a lot
over the years we just actually got a
new blog header on the website changed a
lot but the very first design was like a
blonde girl it was a cartoon character
kind of looking thing but a blonde girl
talking our phone and she had a stack of
books it's totally me
so he not only made the block for me but
she gave me advice you know she hooked
me up on a wordpress site and she kind
of explained to me how I make posts how
I make pages how I do even like HTML
coding it was really helpful you know of
course there was a big learning curve
for me it did kind of take me a while
and trial and error and tears and
frustrations but now I know my blog I
mean you know it's been five years I
know it like the back of my hand it
takes me nothing to throw a post up
there I'm really grateful for her help
and her support and her making me a
beautiful website that I love so much
from there I just the books that I got I
just was going to the library getting
books and then I was reviewing them on
the site you know sometimes I would buy
a book and review sometimes I would swap
with friends and I would review those
books and literally the first few posts
that I had that were book related
because it was chiclet plus from the
beginning I've always been
chicklet plus and done more than just
books on there but if we're talking just
straight book reviews that was all I did
and I think it was three months later I
got a call or I got an email
from Jackie Collins's agent publisher
asking me to review Jackie's books and
interview her and that was like yes
please what's happening and really it
was around that time all of a sudden I
started getting these emails from from
agents and publishers and authors
himself and they were like hi I'll send
you my book if you review it and I
thought you're gonna send me a free copy
of your book and all I need to do is
read it and then review it which is what
I do anyways I mean I thought I had hit
the jackpot it was the most amazing
thing ever and it really happened people
really sent me their books and you know
back in 2009 you books were or coming
out and they were fairly popular but I
didn't have an e-reader at that time
because they weren't like a must as of
that point yet so I was getting all
these print copies in the mail me and
our mailman were on like first-name
basis even when I moved out of my first
apartment and I moved into a condo with
my boyfriend now husband I got to know
the mailman there because I would get so
many books in the mail it was it was
completely overwhelming it was so cool I
thought to be able to say that this is
kind of my part-time job is amazing
because it's something that I absolutely
love and I think it just goes to show if
you really put your energy into
something you know something it took me
a long time to learn WordPress it takes
time to read books it takes time to
review books and it takes time to put
your post up and then it takes time to
get on social media and to talk on
social media about your post and you try
to make connections so other people will
want to read your reviews and want to go
to your website that takes time I I do
make money from my blog but not a lot
from the from the actual blog itself you
know I'm an Amazon affiliate so I put
Amazon links in there and I get very
small Commission's from Amazon each
month it's I mean it's nothing to write
home about and I do now I sell
advertising on chiclet plus because we
have so many page views a day and a
month that I
I do sell advertising on there but you
know back in the day it was really just
it was my passion and it was fun it took
time but I was enjoying it and I really
credit chuckle it plus for helping me
break into my writing career because I
made so many great connections with
other authors you know they would ask me
to review their book and I would and we
would make this connection and when I
thought okay I really am gonna do
something with this manuscript that I
wrote I was able to then ask these
authors hey do you have any advice for
me do you have any editors that you
would recommend can you tell me about
your process and that was I still don't
think I will ever be able to explain
fully how amazing it was to have so many
of these authors take their time and
email me back and tell me you know their
advice their stories their connections
give out names it's so amazing and I
really aspire to be able to do that
myself for other people so I get so many
emails you know for people asking the
same things for recommendations and for
advice and I try to respond to every
single email and just say what I know
because people did that for me and I
just want to keep that circle going
because I think that's just just so
amazing so I really do credit
chicklet plus for helping with my
writing career and then not only just my
writing career but from chiclet plus you
know I created CLP blog tours and CLP
blog tours truly is I mean I call it a
part-time job but sometimes it feels
like more than a part-time job because
running a blog to our company it takes
an extreme amount of hours you know I do
you know I obviously I do charge for
blog tours because it takes so much time
I first started them which i think was
in 2011 2011 yeah I think it was 2011
then I started CLP blog tours and it was
just kind of I don't know if this is
going to happen but I have all these
connections with all these other
bloggers now that
in the book vlogging community why don't
I do something good with it why don't I
try to connect these authors to these
book bloggers and it really has just
done so well I'm so busy with those but
I'm so happy to be doing it because I
love doing it and I think it's so cool
that I can kind of be that middleman and
I can help an author and a reader kind
of hook up I just think it's amazing
I love what I do for CLP vlog tours I
hope I don't ever have to stop doing
them because I think they're fantastic
and again if I didn't have chocolate
plus I wouldn't have CLP blog to us you
know CLP is obviously chocolate plus
just shortened so everything that I've
done in the book industry all revolves
back to chocolate plus Chekov plus was
was will open the door for me it's what
gave me connections it's what gave me
the confidence in myself to be able to
to put myself out there it is really
scary sometimes starting something new
and learning and putting so many hours
into it but to see it all come together
and to see it all be worth it oh my god
now I'm getting emotional very exciting
it's very it's a very proud moment when
you see that so kind of if I have any
advice that I could ever give was if you
know what your passion is go for it if
you don't know what your passion is try
to find it out I I have worked so many
jobs because you know back in the day
when I was convinced that I was never
going to be able to make it as an author
I thought I wanted to be all these
different things and I worked all these
different jobs and I tried to figure out
what it was I wanted to do I'm really
glad I ended up not giving up on being
and other because I'm so happy
where my life is today this is my
full-time job
books this is what I do all day every
day but I just I really do hope that if
you if you have a passion that you go
for it and I don't mean quit your job
and go do what it is you want to do you
know I started five years ago and I just
did this full-time
as of last year so it took me years of
working a full-time job and sometimes a
full-time job and a part-time job and
the book blog and the blog tours and
trying to write books on top of it so it
was hard for a few years trying to
balance everything and get your time
management down and still be able to
have a social life as a 20 21 22 year
old it really is all worth it so you
know if you can do something part-time
that's in your passion and see if you
really do like it and you really do want
to jump into it I hope you can do that I
hope you can find it if you have found
it I think that's amazing
because I still hear some people say you
know that's so awesome that you found
what you want to do with your life you
know I'm 25 or whatever it is and I
can't figure it out try to figure it out
I really try to figure it out because
it's so worth it once once you do it
really is so worth it so that's just a
little bit of my story I hope you
enjoyed hearing it I hope maybe it
sparked something in you to you know try
to again find that passion find what you
want to do it'll give you a kick in the
butt to to try something new and you
know everything we do is a risk
basically that's how I think of things
when they pay off it really does pay off
and it really does feel good so if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
