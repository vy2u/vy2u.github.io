so excited for today's video because it
is going to be a collab video with my
lovely friend Olivia from live loves her
makeup I actually have so many of you
guys to thank for helping me find Liv's
channel there was a video where I asked
for youtuber suggestions and so many
people recommend it live and I was like
I need to go check out her videos and I
did and it was like we became instant
friends we each started supporting each
other's channels watching each other's
videos and basically just chatting
almost every single day it was just one
of those kind of like instant connection
things and I was so excited when she
reached out and asked if I wanted to do
a collab video with her because I was
actually planning on asking her to
collab with me but I knew that she was
in the process of moving so I was going
to wait until she got kind of settled in
and then Google asked her hair and a
specifically wanted to collab but she
actually reached out to me I think she
has such an amazing idea for a collab
video maybe doing
yin and yang reviews look like I'm going
to be grabbing a couple of products that
live love that she recommends uses all
the time but she just absolutely adores
and I do not love them and chat about
that and then also on the flip side I'm
going to take some products that she
does not like - that did not work for
her but I personally love them and kind
of chat about that as well I thought
this video idea would be super
intriguing and I also think it'd be kind
of important to share because I see so
many comments on YouTube that really
bother me when you don't have the same
opinion as someone or someone doesn't
have the same opinion as you and how
offended people get and how they tell
you that you are wrong because of your
opinion and that is just not the case at
all that we can kind of share a good
message what this video is that you can
still be really good friends with
someone and sells a lot of respect for
them even when you have differing
opinions on makeup product something I
feel like that kind of clicked with me a
couple weeks ago when I was reading some
comments about I think it was maybe the
Urban Decay make it heat palette and
then also the morphine jacqueline tell
palette is i feel like a lot of people
i'm not going to say all people but
there's definitely people out there that
they don't want your honest opinion they
want your opinion to match their opinion
and if it doesn't then you are wrong and
that is something that has really really
bothered me
Kairi comments on my videos and on other
people's videos and I just think why can
we not have different opinions
why can't different products not work
for us but work for some people it just
really is something that blows my mind
so when Liz suggested this video idea I
jumped on that right away I was like yes
we have to do that because I think it is
such a good idea
first thank you to Olivia for clubbing
with me on this video I love her style
of videos I think she's frickin
amazeballs I've no idea how she does one
take videos how does she do that I mean
she literally just talked for like 10
minutes and that's it and then she's
done and doesn't have to edit out all of
her life on zaboor rambles on in a
complete tangent for 10 minutes about
nothing or repeats herself 47 times you
know basically everything that I do and
take me so long to edit my videos
because that's my style like I am so
impressed with her it is amazing and
she's so funny because she actually
recommended me recently in her youtubers
that I trust video which I thought was
such an amazing video as well it was so
funny because she was saying how we have
two very like different personalities in
two different styles were more like
review based channels and we talk about
makeup a lot but it's kind of funny cuz
she said I'm like the sweeter version of
her which made me laugh so hard but I
mean Glyph can definitely have quite a
foul mouth on her and really give it to
you straight
but even though that's not necessarily
my personality again it doesn't mean
that I can't get along with list that I
can't watch her channel and that I can't
enjoy her video is because I do all of
those things I just think it's going to
be really fun to see two very different
type of personalities and then
especially doing begging and young
reviews I just think it's going to be a
lot of fun so I'm so excited of course
let's channel if you're not already
familiar with her it will be linked down
below and I'm just super excited but
when we go ahead and get into these
young and young reviews I'm going to do
two products in each category so first
I'm going to go into the products that
live love that she has recommended that
just did not work out for me and the
first one is going to be the anasazi
Beverly Hills in the Cole Guerrero glow
kit I have mentioned this recently and
my best and worst beauty influences were
collab videos and I also mentioned it in
my makeup I changed my mind about
because when I first bought this I
really really loved it I was so
attracted to it I was having a lot of
fun with it and then over time I
realized that it just did not look good
on me shades were just a little bit too
glittery and almost
kind of like too colorful for what I
prefer on my face like sometimes I can
do like an iridescent purple or
something fun like that but kind of
these darker shades and the pink shades
and the purple like it just wasn't
looking the best on me which I was super
bummed about because I really wanted to
love this palette but unfortunately it
just did not work out for me to live
said that she has several in here that
she thinks looks really nice on her skin
tone she really likes the formula of
these which the formula for me
personally I didn't love they're kind of
a thicker highlight and mine is like
super super glittery so those just
aren't the type of highlights that I
prefer but again of course this whole
video idea makeup is all about your
preference and what works the best for
you and she really gravitates towards
this glow kit well it just did not work
out for me because I see Beverly Hills
in the coal grills locate was a win for
Liv but not a win for me so the other
one that I think is so funny if you guys
been following my channel for a while if
you get a good chuckle out of this but I
think Olivia kind of got the idea for
this video because of our contrasting
reviews on the Too Faced white chocolate
chip palette
so the white chocolate chip palette did
not work out for me that was kind of
like my last draw with Too Faced I was
getting pretty frustrated with the brand
and then after I bought that palette and
was so highly unimpressed with it I've
just kind of put a pause on my
relationship with Too Faced or on the
breaker right now and live actually
really did like the Too Faced white
chocolate chip palette she does have
reviews of both the white chocolate chip
and also being matte palette that they
came out with at the same time and she
did like it she said that she liked the
formula she thought it was very similar
to the chocolate bar palette which I
know are very hyped and like very loved
products but I actually had not tried
any of them I finally just got the
chocolate bon bons palette sent to me
from a subscriber so I was able to try
the formula for the first time and I did
really like it but I did not think the
white chocolate chip palette was very
pigmented and she did mention in her
review video that she does kind of have
to build up those shades a little bit
more but she didn't mind and she thought
the shades were more unique to the Too
Faced palette and there was plenty of
shades in there that she really
gravitated towards and he was wearing
that palette in the video that she post
and I thought it did look really nice on
her but for me that's how it just did
not work out was I gave like my last
Rolla stupid she had a good experience
that one so I mean if that can't show
that you can have such a differing
opinions on a palette and you can still
be friends and you can still respect
each others opinions then like I don't
know what else does because that's
definitely a palette that has such
strong feelings about but I thought that
was really funny how different we are in
our opinions of the two-faced white
chocolate chip palette the flipside I'm
going to talk about a couple products
that just did not work out for Liv she
did not like them at all but worked out
really well for me and are actually some
of my favorite so first up is actually
just a brand in general and that is
morphe brushes i have a ton for morphe
brushes this is the new drexel hill
palette this is the 35 are that i
absolutely love i own a ton of morphe
brushes i have a really large morphe
brushes collection i have a full
collection video out there that i can
leave like down below started buying
from worki a very long time ago and I
just always loved everything from them I
know Liz said that she does not like the
eyeshadow palettes at all because she
just could not get on with the eyeshadow
palettes and they are some of my
favorites I own four different eyeshadow
palettes the 35 are the 35 T the 35 o
and now the Jacqueline Helen morphe
palette I don't even know how many
makeup brushes I own is probably a
sickening number to be honest I love
their liquid lipsticks I've been
recommending the liquid lipsticks a ton
I know she said that she also tried out
the concealers and they did not work for
her at all I actually have not tried
their concealers so I can't speak to
them but I love morphe I recommend them
so much I use something from morphe you
on nearly a daily basis even if it is
just a brush or I'm just dipping into an
eyeshadow palette for a color but again
just one of my favorite brands and I
know that she has said that she she's
completely off the brand right now which
again is totally fine everybody's going
to have different opinions on what
brands they want to support what
collaborators they want to support you
know I watch every one of Jacqueline's
Hills video where Olivia says that she
can't watch her not who she doesn't like
her but she says that because Jacqueline
is very hyper and live is very hyper she
can make her more hyper she prefers to
watch people who are more calm which
maybe is the reason she likes me because
I think I'm pretty calm myself but I
just found that really interesting when
I was going through some of her past
videos and seeing like how much she just
liked mortgage thought that it's so
funny because I just I love morphe and I
recommend them so much so that's
definitely one that we have a very
different opinion on and the last item
that I mentioned for this video is one
of my Holy Grails a product that I've
designed since college that I absolutely
love so much it is the pur cosmetics 4
and 1 press
mineral powder I have to write here
because I'm almost out of one and I
already bought it back up again I
started buying these when I was in
college I strolled into my local Alta
looking for a powder foundation because
I didn't wear like real heavy
foundations yet at the time but I wanted
something to kind of like even out my
skin tone just make my skin look a
little bit better without putting a lot
of makeup on it and I was referred to
the pier four and one press mineral
powders and I have loved them ever since
I've gone through so many of these that
is a little bit ridiculous
but one of my favorite powders
especially in the summertime where I
don't where I have a foundation every
single day or if I know I'm going to be
outside all day and I don't want a lot
of makeup on my face I consistently
reach for the SC's abundant Holy Grail
videos these have been in product
favorite videos writer diet eggs these
have consistently been mentioned because
they're some of my favorite products
live did mention these in a product
sales video I believe that it was and
she said the color just did not get on
with her skin tone she said it thought
it'd take tup on her skin really bad and
that it enlarged her pores and I haven't
found any of those issues with this
particular powder again it's just one of
my favorites but and it's just it's so
interesting to me and I love that this
concept of this video because it was so
much fun to see what we have such
differing opinions on not just like oh I
kind of like that and you kind of don't
like that like these are some of your
favorites that I just cannot take and
these are some of my favorites that you
just cannot handle it's so very
interesting to me but the pier forward
one is definitely in that category for
us it's just so interesting to me about
the pier 4 and 1/2 press mineral powder
is definitely a yin and yang review
between Liv and I but then after that
one is going to do it for my collab
video with Liv love here we go and so
that is going to do it for the Union
Yang review collab video with my friend
Olivia I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video I hope that you found
it helpful and I also hope that you
found it interesting to be able to see
how two friends can really have very
different opinions not only on products
but also on brands in general how we can
still respect each other and get along
with each other and form a friendship
with one another and that just because
people might have different opinions on
different items doesn't mean that
they're wrong and doesn't mean that you
can't still continue to watch and
support or anything like that I just I
was really so excited that she had this
video idea because I think it extends
more than just doing any sort of regular
kind of collab video or
tutorial or anything like that feel like
we're really spreading a good message
here with this video and I'm just I'm
just really really pleased to be able to
take part in it of course all of the
links for her YouTube and Instagram
everything like that he'll have that
link down below and again I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much to Olivia for collabing with
me I love this video idea I hope some of
you guys will do it as well team up with
one of your friends team up with someone
that you watch on YouTube and see what
your Jing and yang reviews are and make
a video I really really hope that you
guys will I hope we see some more of
these videos floating around but if you
guys did enjoy this video I hope that
you will give it a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys real soon
in my next one hi
