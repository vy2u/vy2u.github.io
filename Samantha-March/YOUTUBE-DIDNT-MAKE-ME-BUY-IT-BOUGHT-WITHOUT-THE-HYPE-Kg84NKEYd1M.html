today's video
okay this intro is gonna be a little bit
long so I got a story to tell you guys
okay this video is inspired by a video
that my friend Jessica Braun did here
recently where she was talking about
makeup products that she would still
have in her collection if YouTube didn't
exist
I was watching her video and I
immediately was like yep I'm doing that
video I put it on my list
I started brainstorming ideas and as I
was brainstorming I was like why does
this seem familiar to me I was like I
feel like the products that are on this
list I feel like I've already mentioned
them in some capacity now I do post a
video every single day and I have posted
a video at least six or seven days a
week for probably over a year now I
think it was last summer that I started
challenging myself to a daily upload so
I've done a lot of videos and I know
that there are repeat items and them but
I was like this just feels funny to me
and then this morning this morning as I
was you know this was the day I was
going to film this video my friend Arnie
Elaine I think it's how you say her last
name she posted a video that she said
was inspired by Jessica Braun and it was
makeup products that she's purchased
with no like beauty guru influence so
products that she just decided to
purchase herself and as she was
explaining that in her intro it clicked
for me I was like ah that's why it seems
so familiar last year I posted a video
called
YouTube didn't make me buy it where I
was talking about either untyped makeup
products
makeup products that I bought before I
had a YouTube channel or products that I
bought after my channel you know had
begun but I purchased them with no
Beauty influence their influence
just like karna was saying so that she
made it click for me I was like I
thought this seemed familiar because I
had so many products on my list and I
just thought I think I've done this
before so that's what today's video is
going to be I'm going to just do another
YouTube didn't make me buy it style
video inspired by Jessica brown and also
Arnaz so I will have both of their
videos linked down below if you would
like to see them but it was just so
funny I'll leave my first video link
down below too because some of the first
items I was putting on there was like
the Maybelline lipsticks the NYX soft
matte lip cream like even my beloved
Sephora 57 brush and those were the
first items that were
popping into my head as I was making
this and I was like have I done before
what this just seems really weird it was
last year I did not do my brows at that
time in my life yet so I don't want to
get any broad comments on that video in
case you decide you want to go watch it
but I know that was a longer intro but I
just thought it was kind of funny but
thank you to Jessica for inspiring me to
do this again cuz that was my only video
that I did of YouTube didn't make me buy
it YouTube made me buy a videos were
really popular so I wanted to do a spin
on it last year and then I totally
forgot forgot about it but but that's
what today's video is going to be after
that intro just a product that I
purchased without the hype around them
without a bunch of people recommending
them you know maybe I should set the
store and thought I'm just gonna go
ahead and buy this so I only have a
couple products on here but why don't we
go ahead and get started
the first item that I thought of after
all my old items was this one here from
covergirl it's the vitalist healthy
elixir a foundation so this is one that
I bought fairly recently after the
release so there wasn't a lot of reviews
on it yet like I think I purchased in a
time where I hadn't heard anybody talk
about it yet and I just noticed it at my
CVS in my CVS we have like the make up
section and then there's a section in
like the snack aisle that has new makeup
releases once I discovered that because
I enjoyed the snack aisle it was like my
whole world was opened up because I I
would always keep saying like CVS never
has any new releases like why don't they
have any of them because they hide them
but I found him why do you hide the new
stuff like hide the old stuff or
something but I was wandering through
the snack aisle and I found this and I
was like this looks nice and I started
reading about it said vitalists healthy
elixir and has vitamins in it I actually
I can remember pulling my phone out and
looking it up and like looking at Ulta
and looking out the different shades and
what the shade selection is said to try
to help me purchase it I purchased 740
and I really enjoyed this foundation
it's one of my favorites it is a hot
looking mess because it's one of my
favorites and I use it a lot but I think
it's a fabulous it drugstore foundation
I love the coverage on it I love how
natural it makes my skin look but yeah I
bought this one with no hype nobody was
telling me to buy it and I'm really
happy that I did another one that I
purchased again from CVS is this one
from Milani it's the prime shield of
face primer it's the Matt
flying and pore-minimizing primer so
I've had this one for a while and I feel
like you can kind of tell
maybe my like inexperience with makeup
when I did purchase this one because
it's a mattifying a face primer and I'm
more on the dry side so like mmm usually
like the majority of my primers in my
collection are like hydrating and
moisturizing primers and then you got
the Milani mattifying one so that was
kind of bizarre on my end but this was
one where I was buying something from
Milani and I don't think it was a
product for me I think I was buying
something like for a friend like someone
said she wanted something and I was like
getting it for her birthday or something
and it was a buy one get one half off so
I was like oh this one looks nice and I
just bought it so silly but I don't feel
like I really hear a lot of people talk
about this I mean it's definitely an
older product and it's not my favorite
I've been probably because I don't need
a mattifying primer most days so there's
that but it's also incredibly like very
much like a silicon-based primer and I
don't like I just don't prefer silicon
based primers and it's honestly like I
don't like how it makes my hands feel
and that's such a small thing but I also
I don't love the way it went in the face
field either but I don't like the way it
feels on my hands but this one wasn't a
favorite and I only have myself to blame
for that one it just hoped it like my
girl the next one that I have is a
mascara that I purchased from Ulta this
is from a Catrice and this is the rocket
or extreme Volume Mascara I've talked
about this one on my channel before too
because I ended up really enjoying this
one and I only have myself to thank for
that one thank you so much girl this is
one where I was buying something from
Catrice and again it was a tall tub does
like a buy one get one 50% off and I was
kind of like browsing through like what
should I buy and I was like I feel like
I could have another drugstore
affordable mascara in my collection and
I'm really glad that I did because this
is really good and actually I think this
is my second one I think I went through
my first one and repurchased one so
that's how much I enjoy it it's a
waterproof mascara so I've worn a ton
last summer
I wore this a lot when we were doing
like our sand volleyball and I still
want
have like mascara on I would wear this
one because it held up in the heat
really well but it also just makes your
lashes look really nice I need volume
and length when it comes to my mascara
and I feel like this one gave it to me
and I really enjoyed that there was zero
transfer with it
so this is a good one next up I have
this item here from Benefit this is the
hoola kwikki contour stick I don't know
what I was gonna say but it's the
contour stick from benefit I purchased
this one mostly just cuz it intrigued me
and I purchased it right away so I felt
like there wasn't really any reviews on
it there wasn't really any hype on it
and I mean honestly I don't feel like I
even now I mean it's been out for a
while but even after it released I still
feel like I didn't hear a lot of people
talking about this one but it was back
when I was kind of more into cream
contour they're like right now I'm not
really into cream products at all but
there was a definitely a point where I
was using cream contour a ton and so
when this came out I was like oh my gosh
this is perfect
I will say the shade is better off as a
bronzer for me I didn't necessarily use
it as a contour because it was a little
bit deeper and a little bit more on the
warm side but it worked as a good
bronzer for me I don't reach for it as
much anymore because like I said I've
kind of gotten away from the cream
products but I enjoyed it I just thought
it looked cool like I thought the
packaging look cool I liked the hoola
bronzer it's one of the first items I
ever purchased from Benefit so I thought
it was intriguing to see so that's why I
purchased it I mean it was kind of like
a packaging made me purchase it but then
I was just curious about it as well
yeah the hoola kwikki contour stick
would be a YouTube didn't make me buy it
another one here from Maybelline this is
the total temptation brow pencil I've
been talking about this a ton on my
channel it's one of my favorite brow
pencils I've already gone through one or
two I have another one brand new staring
right at me I see you girl because this
is one of my favorite brow pencils and
it's super affordable but this is
another one that I purchased almost
right when the total temptation line
came out from Maybelline and I felt like
there was something that I wanted from
that collection and I went to order it
and it already sold out and I was bummed
and then I decided to buy this was that
how it was something along those lines
but
looking for something else and then this
was still available so I decided to go
ahead and purchase it and I'm really
glad that I did because I mean it's
definitely turned into one of my
favorite brow pencils it was not hooked
up yet I feel like I've been seeing more
and more people talking about it lately
and I like yes because I really do enjoy
this brow pencil it reminds me of the
benefit goof proof the applicator does I
get mine in the shade blonde but so one
of my favorites and then next up here
these are from Marc Jacobs which you
might think when I say this is a product
for Marc Jacobs you're like no YouTube
did make you buy that but let me explain
and because actually I have this little
mini guy here in slow burn from Marc
Jacobs I was just putting this lipstick
the other day actually I purchased this
in a Sephora like give me some nudes or
give me some lip collections and I've
been purchasing those since before
YouTube like I've always been a deal
chaser and I've always been someone who
loves minis and loves buying sets of
things like I was saying with benefit
and the hoola bronzer one of the first
things are probably the first thing I
purchased from benefit was one of those
boxes like you know they keep releasing
the boxes when I was first buying from
benefit I bought one of those boxes and
it had like the hoola bronzer in it and
I have like a lip gloss and eyeshadows
and like a mascara and all of this I've
always loved those I've always
gravitated towards those so I've been
buying the Sephora collection like
favorite collection sets for years I
used to buy the mascara once quite a bit
as well like I've just always really
enjoyed them so that's why I said that
this would be in there because I did
start purchasing them way before YouTube
and even when I got on YouTube I feel
like no one really talked about those a
lot I used to make dedicated videos on
the Sephora lip collections like I would
have boxed them on I would try them all
it was like one of my favorite things to
do whenever a new set came out I was
like yes and now I feel like my
collection has grown so much that
there's always like two or three and the
collections that I'm like will already
have that published by that site but
that's why I would say that these were
kind of like untyped products for me but
I fell in love with this little guy
because of that collection and I since
went on to get this little guy a camera
if it came in a collection but I I want
to say it was a point perk or something
along those lines I don't think it came
in
set but now I have another one and
actually I even went on to purchase
another Marc Jacobs lip product that I
should probably put out the Marc Jacob
liquid lip creme I have it and truther
bear is that shade yeah truther bears
that shade and I purchased it because I
like these so much but the new shade
that I got that I got is called Kiss
Kiss Bang Bang
I love both these shades love the liquid
lip creme but I feel like the reason why
I got into Marc Jacobs is not because of
YouTube is now because the height that
the brand gets but is because I was
buying the Sephora favorites collections
that's long before my YouTube days so I
thought that was pretty funny but you
get in here figured it counted and then
the last product that I have up like
setlist wasn't too long watch a lot of
YouTube take a lot of recommendations
seriously but the last one I have is
actually a new product here and this is
from Sunday Riley it's the influencer
foundation and again it might be like
hey this is a hyped up foundation a lot
of people are buying it and wearing it
but I bought it before any of the
reviews came out and I put it in a will
I buy a video and I was like I'm just
really curious about this foundation I'm
really curious about this I want to try
out that foundation and unfortunately
mmm this is one that I probably should
have waited on the reviews for because I
probably wouldn't have purchased it I
haven't seen a whole lot of people who
are really enjoying this one I did just
recently do a Sephora vib sale haul a
follow-up video where I'm reviewing
everything that I picked up in the hall
and I do review this guy and I said it
just did not really work out for me it's
not my favorite I am still planning on
returning it so that's kind of a bummer
but yeah I bought this before any I
don't mean I don't even know if I would
still consider it being like hyped right
now but before any review video started
coming or people really started talking
about this it was just one that
immediately caught my attention and
again it's why I didn't necessarily want
to do like if YouTube didn't exist
because like what I know about Sunday
Riley if I didn't watch YouTube I'm not
a hundred percent sure on that maybe
some of the drugstore brands I I would
say yes to but even like Catrice I'm not
sure if I would be familiar with the
brand if it wasn't for a YouTube kind of
thing so that's why I kind of wanted to
do what I did last year and just saying
YouTube didn't make me buy these
products I didn't fall into the hype I
didn't see everybody reviewing and
raving and saying
and all of that for these particular
products because what I would put in the
influencer into that category so
hopefully that makes sense
but yeah after that foundation from
Sunday Riley that's gonna do it for
today's video
okay so that is everything for today's
video talking about some products that
YouTube didn't make me buy I hope that
you guys enjoyed it seeing out the
products that I chose to feature in this
video again my video from last year will
be linked down below it's man sometimes
watching videos I just did like a
flashback favorites video as well and

watch your old videos like Oh Corrine

below and then also Jessica and also are
