so excited for today's video because it
is going to be another new tag video
I've been saying I've been really into
tag videos recently and I am excited to
come back with another one and I'm also
super excited because this video is
going to be a collaboration with my
friend Jessica Braun our GM beauty 89 I
am so excited to club with her I've
wanted to club with her forever she's
one of my absolute favorite channels and
one that I've been watching for such a
long time and I just relate with her so
much I got the idea to do this tag video
a while back and I started forming some
questions for it and as I was watching
just cuz videos
she kept saying certain things that
would pertain back to the questions I
had thought of so I thought maybe she
might like to do this as well so I'm
just emailed her one day and was like
hey I had this idea here are my
questions would you want to do this with
me and she wrote back inside yes I was
like oh my god okay so I'm really
excited for you at the collab with
Jessica I of course will have her
channel linked it down below if you are
not already subscribed to her which I'm
sure a lot of you are but if you are not
yet I really recommend that you head
over to her channel I think if you
really like my channel you will really
enjoy her channel she was one who let me
know that just because I have a beauty
channel doesn't mean I always have to be
doing tutorials and kind of like feeling
that sort of pressure I made a comment
in one of her videos that she just likes
to talk about makeup and she just likes
to chat with the camera and I thought
that's what I wanted to do too that's
why I started a channel and then I kind
of fell into all these different YouTube
pressures and I wasn't really sure and
she was the one that kind of made it
click for me and you know just got me
excited and motivated again and reminded
me of why I started a channel and what I
wanted to do with it so I love her
channel so much I love her so much and
really excited to be doing this collab
with her but I haven't even told you
what it is this is going to be a YouTube
first type of tag so we just have six
different questions that we're going to
answer all pertaining to YouTube and
first times with YouTube I don't know if
that makes any sense but we'll just hop
into the questions if anybody else wants
to do this tag video as well I will take
a couple channels down below of course
and I will also list out the six
different questions so if you want to do
it which I hope some of you do if you
want to the questions will be down there
as well if you want to answer them and
if you do the tag I hope that you'll
take me as well so I can watch
but I know those a long intro but why
don't I go ahead and hop into the
questions all right so the first
question I had was what was the first
YouTube video you ever watched can you
remember the first YouTube video that
you watched I could remember mine
because it was a Carli bybel tutorial
and I can't remember exactly which
tutorial it was that Carly was doing but
I remember at the very first YouTube
like makeup video that I watched that I
like sought out was from Carli bybel the
gal who was doing my makeup for my
wedding when we were doing like a
wedding trial makeup run she made a
comment about how much she loves Carly's
YouTube channel and she really learns a
lot from it and I kind of thought like
what do you mean you watch someone do
their makeup on YouTube that sounds
weird I think quite understand it and
she was like no you have to watch this
girl like she is so sweet and she just
does the best makeup and she's so
beautiful and I remember going home and
going to YouTube and typing this name
and this girl pops up and I was like ok
if she is gorgeous and I started
watching her videos and I was like oh my
gosh she's teaching people she's she's
teaching people how to do makeup like
this is insane because I've always been
someone who I love makeup so much and I
would buy makeup but then I wouldn't
know what to do with it tried to make
myself look like a photo or look like a
celebrity on TV and I just would always
fail and I would get so frustrated so
through watching YouTube I am completely
self-taught with makeup through all of
the tutorials that I watch but Carli
bybel is she was the first one I wish I
could remember exactly which tutorial it
was of hers but I remember it being a
tutorial because I just remember
thinking she's teaching me this is
amazing so that was really cool the
second question is the first channel I
subscribed to and again that would be
Carli bybel and I remember I didn't do
it right away because I didn't I still
didn't quite understand I wasn't a
YouTube watcher at that time but I
remember I kept going back to her her
videos and watching more of her videos
and more of her tutorials and in one of
the videos she said you know I hope that
you'll subscribe and I was like ok I'll
subscribe like you want me to subscribe
I'll subscribe and so I know a lot of
people think it can maybe be kind of
annoying when people when youtubers say
in videos like I hope you'll subscribe
to my channel and you know grandma this
was in 2013 I think it was so you know
quite a few years ago but some people
might still be new to YouTube and not
stand that subscribing is a thing or
subscribing can help out the people that
you enjoy watching so for me that's kind
of why I always say it because I
remember watching her channel her saying
I hope that you'll subscribe and I
thought well okay like I like you I keep
searching out your videos you're
teaching me like you want me to click a
button for you like sure I think like a
button for you like I can do that so I
don't know that's kind of something that
I've learned along the way but I know
that she was also the first channel I
subscribed to but I remember it taking a
little bit and she had to literally tell
me to subscribe for me to do it the
third question is your first YouTube
made me buy it product there's a bunch
of videos out that was started a while
back of YouTube made me buy it basically
what's the really hype to make up that
everybody's always talking about on
YouTube that you went out and bought
because you always hear it and see it in
tutorials and I had to think about this
because I had certain items pop up in my
mind I was like the Milani Luminoso
blush the Kat Von D shade + light
eyeshadow palette I know that was a
YouTube made me buy it
the balm mary-lou manizer the bomb was
my first highlight I remember and so I
was thinking about all these because I
was like well I could mention all of
them so and I kind of did want to
mention them because those are good
memories for me but one of the first
YouTube made me buy up products and
again I'm going to go back to Carly's
channel was a Mac pigment and a Mac lip
liner and mac fix+ I remember going into
the Mac store because like I said Carly
was the first one who I started watching
and I really only watched Carly's
tutorials for the longest time like I
don't know if it just didn't click to me
that there's more people out there doing
the same thing but I just continually
like I wouldn't even pay attention to my
youtube homepage I would just go to
youtube and I would type in Carly's name
and then her videos would pop up and I
would watch them so she was the one who
was getting all these recommendations
from but I noticed that she always used
Mac lip liner she was always spraying
her face with this fix+
and she was always using a Mac pigment
in vanilla and I actually had to google
where Mac store was where I live in Iowa
and I found one in to one of our malls
and I remember going there and buying
those three products and getting my Mac
back and just being like I'm like Carly
now this is the best day so I
can't remember for sure like what was
that absolute first product I might have
bought Luminoso first I might have
bought the highlighter first I can't
remember but I can just so vividly
remember that day walking into the MAC
store and being like I need this I need
this I need definitely the vanilla
pigment cuz that is the one that Curley
uses like that was such a fun memory to
me so I thought that one could be fun to
share but those are a couple of my first
YouTube made me buy a product so I
thought that was pretty funny the fourth
question is who was your first YouTube
friend or maybe the first youtuber that
you did a collaboration with I thought
would be fun to chat about and my first
like I always say she is my first
YouTube friend she is the first one that
I did a collaboration with but I always
say like she was she was my first friend
on YouTube was the first like other
youtuber that I became a friend with and
this is Alex from beauty addict next
door I of course will have her channel
linked down below as well but I remember
I was watching her videos and you know I
always come in on everybody's videos
everybody's video that I watch I leave a
comment and it might not me might not be
the most insightful comment ever I'm not
super funny or witty like that sometimes
it's as simple as great video like your
shirt well like your nail-polish but I
try to make sure I comment on
everybody's video because I think it's
important I like when people comment on
my videos so I try to comment on other
people's videos but I was commenting on
her video she was commenting on my
videos and I was like cool this is
awesome like I really enjoy this girl
and whatnot and then she sent me an
Instagram message one day and said would
you want to do a collaboration and I had
seen other YouTube collaborations going
on so I knew what they were but I was
way too scared I I don't even know if I
had a thousand subscribers when we did
our collaboration so I was very small
and I was just too scared to reach out
to anybody I was like I don't know if
anybody like knows me or if anybody want
to like essentially work with me or like
shout out my channel I like I don't know
how to go about asking people and so
when I got the message from her I was
like oh my gosh yes like absolutely I
totally want to do this and we did what
do we do like a holiday glam makeup
blood I think it was that we did and it
was so much fun and she kind of like
gave me that motivation to be able to
reach out to other people because then
from there I would reach out to other
creators as well and be like hey do you
want to do a collab video but Alex
wasn't my
first one that I did a collaboration
with and kind of like my first YouTube
friends so ah good memories good
memories there already the next question
what is this the fifth question we all
know I can't count when I make lists I
think this is the fifth question is what
is the first youtube video that you
watched today I'm just kind of nosy when
I come up with questions I'm just
curious
well the first youtube video you watch
today for me my first youtube video that
I watched this morning was from live or
live loves her makeup one of my friends
here on YouTube she posted a follow-up
video to a Sephora and alcohol I believe
it was um so she had like a whole update
video and that was the first one I
watched live and I are in very different
time zones I'm in the Midwest and she's
in Arizona and so I think she's three
hours behind me I want to say yeah three
hours behind me so a lot of times when
she uploads at night she'll upload it's
too late like operations on my computer
I've already gone to bed and I always
get so sad because I also when my
friends post you know I want to support
and I want to watch their video as
quickly as I can as soon as it pops up
with my feet I want to watch I want to
comment I'm gonna like I want to support
that way but sometimes that she'll post
too late at night but us I'll see it in
the morning that's always the first
video I click on like I see I got to
watch that video girl so yeah that was
the first video that I watched today was
from lip I'll have her channel link down
below as well and I'm tagging her to do
this video too and then the final
question is what is the first video on
your to watch list
I utilize the YouTube to watch list a
ton I mean I have I post a video about
this recently I'm kind of going through
a bit of a rough time so I've kind of
stepped back a little bit from social
media so my to watch list I think has
over 200 videos on it right now again I
try to get to my friends as quickly as I
can to be able to support but sometimes
especially going through something it's
not the best to be so saturated in
social media you just kind of gotta take
a step back and breathe a little bit but
my to watch list
yes I I utilize that all of the time so
if I don't see you know of a video that
I know what I want to watch right away
I'll head over to my to watch list and
I'll just let it play and watch
everybody's videos but I actually don't
know the first one oh my to watch list
the hold on
to look that up I was calling it the to
watch list but now it's the watch later
or has it always been the watch later
list and I just thought it was to watch
I'm not sure but the button I clicked on
it says watch later but - the first one
on my watch later list is a chitchat get
ready with me trying new products
YouTube life etc from Kim Missoula I'm
probably saying your last name Ron Kim
but I really enjoy Kim's Channel I have
found it pretty recently but I watch all
of her videos and I think that they are
super fun so she has a chitchat get
ready with me that I'm excited to watch
that as next on my list I will leave at
Kim's channel a link to down below as
well if you haven't checked her out I
really enjoy her video so that is the
first one that is on there maybe I'll
just tell you guys like the next three
and then I got makeup struggles she's
gonna talk about palettes I would
redesign that sounds like a good one I
want to leave her channel link down
below to do this tag and then my third
video is from Kendall Alfred it's her
January 2018 boxycharm unboxing a link
down below I know I just asked for the
first one but I thought it could be fun
to throw up my first three in there but
those are what is on at my watch later
list but after that that was the sixth
and final question for this YouTube a
first time video so that's gonna be
everything for this YouTube first a tag
video I hope that you guys enjoyed
seeing it it's just kind of like a fun
more casual tag video but I thought
maybe it could be a fun one to do and
again a big thank you to Jessica for
