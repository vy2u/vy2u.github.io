I'm so excited for today's video because
it is going to be a YouTube hacks video
but not just any YouTube hack is going
to be how to start a YouTube channel
with no money or very little money
recently just did a QA and probably the
most asked question that I saw come in
was how did I start my youtube channel
what is my advice to beginner starting a
YouTube channel and I really want to
start a YouTube channel but I have no
money what is my advice to you guys and
I really didn't even touch on it in the
Q&amp;amp;A video because I thought you know
what I can make a whole dedicated video
to this so if you guys are beginners
with YouTube or you're still wanting to
try out YouTube but you haven't pulled
the trigger yet I hope this video helps
you so these hacks are going to be
things that I have done personally
myself I'm not suggesting anything that
I've seen in other videos these are all
things that I have done myself that I
would recommend to you guys you know
when I first got on YouTube last year I
didn't have a camera I recently bought a
camera within the past three months I
did not have any lighting and I still do
not have any professional lighting and I
first started I didn't have any editing
software I purchased editing software
about six months ago and when I first
started I was like I don't even know
what I'm supposed to talk about I don't
have a big makeup collection I don't
even know how to do makeup so I can't do
tutorials like what the heck am I even
going to talk about so I just wanted to
take you guys through everything that I
did in the beginning and some of what
I'm still doing now and let you guys
know that you don't need to have a lot
of money or fancy equipment or a big
makeup collection to get started on
YouTube like just look around your house
and you have to be a little bit creative
with some of your solutions but if this
is something that you really want to do
you will be able to find a way to do it
and that to me is advice that I would
give for not even youtube just whatever
it is that you want to do in life if
it's something that you really want to
do you might have to be a little
creative and figuring out how exactly to
get there or to achieve what it is that
you want but if it's something that you
really really are passionate about you
will find you will find the time you
will find the way like you will just
find a way to do it so I do want to
point out that the
is not any sort of video of how to have
a really successful YouTube channel or
how to make money on YouTube that is not
the subjects that I'm talking on I'm
simply talking tips and tricks to get
your YouTube channels started how to
film videos edit videos things like that
obviously I am still a very small
Channel I've only been on YouTube for a
year so I don't want to say that this
video is going to like teach you those
ways I mean if you want to learn how to
have a successful channel or learn how
to make money on YouTube I'm sure that
you can google it and you will find
several videos talking about it but for
me myself I do not feel comfortable
giving out that sort of advice yet
because I don't feel like I'm in the
position to be able to do that yet this
is geared more towards beginners you
would like to see more hex videos
regarding how I start at YouTube or any
other facet of YouTube you can leave
your comments and suggestions below and
hopefully there will be a time in the
future where I will be able to make more
hex videos for you because I was really
excited to make this mostly just because
I hope that I'm helping you guys though
without further ado why don't we hop
into my hacks so the first hack I'm
going to go over is about the setup that
I use when I first started filming and
how I actually filmed my videos so like
I mentioned I had no camera
I had no tripod I had no real setup so
this is what I did we had two bar stools
in our kitchen I would sit on one and
the note directly across from me i
stacked books and my husband made me
this nice piece of wood that my dog
promptly chewed up but that is what
would hold my phone which is what
recorded all of my videos in the
beginning so I would set that piece of
wood on top of the books and then just
put my phone on top of it the newer
phones these days have a really good
camera quality and have HD video so I
definitely recommend looking at your
phones to see if they would be able to
record good videos for you I got so many
questions in the beginning of what
camera are you using I love your quality
it was my phone which is a Samsung
Galaxy six and what I would do is just
oh there's there's my family I'm so
proud of my phone case what I would do
is just take my phone horizontally and
place it on that piece of wood and
record it
that is definitely a tip the first
YouTube video that I recorded I had my
phone vertical and for YouTube you
definitely want your vide
to be horizontal it just looks a lot
better so voila
that was my super professional video
recording a setup
in the beginning for the second hack I
want to talk about video editing like I
mentioned I didn't have video editing
but YouTube actually has editing and it
is all free so you would just go into
your video manager select the video you
want to edit come up to the top where it
says enhancements and then you will see
this button that is trim now you can
trim the beginnings and ends of your
videos when you're pressing record and
sitting down you can cut out the middle
of your videos where maybe you lost
between a thought you're preaching for a
product you're dog started barking
whatever you can cut out clips of those
videos this is what I used up until I
bought my video editing software and
it's really good but they also have the
YouTube video editor which you will see
here at the bottom of the screen this
took me a little bit to get a hold of or
to get the hang of and I thought it was
really cool because basically you can
tie different clips of your videos
together and you can put transitions in
them so if you see videos where clips
fade out or they swipe to another video
clip this is where I would do it so you
could drag your Clips down to the
timeline and then come up to these two
triangles and that is where all your
transitions are and again this is
completely free I definitely recommend
trying it out for a beginner the next
thing I want to talk about is lighting
so with a lighting I only use natural
light and this is true to this day I
have no soft boxes I have no umbrella
lights I use nothing but natural light
so this is me regularly recording a
video I am facing a big window in my
office and just using natural light and
then I'm gonna flip it around and I am
facing my back to the window so you see
the window that I look out of when I
film this is me it was my back to the
window obviously you can barely see me
so you definitely want to be facing the
light and then I did it from another
angle as well so I'm sad what is now in
my office facing into my office and it's
better but it's still not the best so
facing natural light is your friend the
next talk I want to talk about is
actually more like Instagram related but
I feel like YouTube and Instagram kind
of go here
in hand and it is how to take photos for
Instagram I would use to do product
photos on my carpet which does not look
the best so I found some tool that was
leftover from my wedding I grabbed it
out and I would put the products on top
of it
zoom in for a nice picture and then you
have a much better quality Instagram
photo of your products or you're not
just laying them on your carpet another
trick that I used was grabbing out my
yoga mat this is my regular old yoga mat
but when you flip it to the back it's a
blank white canvas and so I would do
that for a while I would just place my
products on top and once again
instagram-worthy photo the third hack
that I do and this is actually what I do
to this day if you guys follow me on
snapchat you see that this is what I do
we have a break big framed photo of the
Green Bay Packers diehards that we
haven't been able to put it put up yet
as our basement gets finished but if you
flip it over it's just a big blank white
canvas and this is what I use to take
all my product photos on and I love it
when you start your channel and you're
like what in the world do I talk about
so when I first started my channel I was
doing mow I feel like I was doing more
books and then a little bit of beauty
and then I kind of went to like half in
half and then I've switched over to
Beauty versus books simply because that
it seems that's what people are most
interested in my book blog that I have
which is chiclet plus when I would do
books and beauty on their books were
getting a better our page views and more
interaction than the Beauty posts were
but on YouTube is completely flipped and
I'm getting more comments and
interactions on the Beauty videos vs.
the book videos so I do want to make
sure that I'm putting out content that
people do want to see and watch you know
that is a piece of advice that I would
give is to watch it you know Lennox page
and see which videos of yours are doing
the best because that will help you
understand what it is that your
subscribers are most interested in
seeing and to kind of build off that in
the beginning I was like what what am I
supposed to be talking about so looked
through my makeup collection and was
like what can I do here
I did like my top Maybelline products
was I think was a video that I did in
the very beginning they just go through
your makeup collection and see what you
have now you could even feel like hey
here's my beginner makeup collection
that could be a fun video to like a look
back like if I would've done that I
think that could have been really cool
to even compare it to where I am a year
later after being on YouTube and seeing
where my makeup collection has gone like
that would have been something really
neat to do is talk about your top 5
blushes your top 5 mascaras you don't
have to go out and keep buying new
products in order to haul and be able to
review just look around in your own
house and see what it is that you can do
also tag videos are a really big thing I
did a lot of tag videos when I was first
starting out because I was like I'm just
not really sure what it is to talk about
there was like a summer favorites tags
that I did I think maybe a fall
favorites tags that I did there's like a
blush tag video out there I also did
like the about me tag - 50 questions
tags I mean if you just look up YouTube
tag videos you can find a ton of
different tag videos to talk about and
those are a lot of fun to do as well and
if you are on a budget and you but you
still you do want to go out and you want
to be able to do hauls definitely check
out the drugstore don't forget to use
your coupon but like Dollar Tree hauls
are really big here on YouTube - I'm
constantly seeing people buying like
good makeup items at like the Dollar
Tree Dollar General places where they
are a dollar or very very inexpensive
they do have like cool makeup brands
that are there as well and you could do
a haul from there but maybe you can pick
up quite a few products to be able to
share but you're spending under 10 and
20 dollars so if you do want to go out
and buy things but you don't want to be
going to Sephora and spending 50 dollars
on an eyeshadow palette think about the
drugstores and even think about
something like the Dollar Tree because
you could be able to find products there
as well so I'm just going to wrap it up
before my last hack I hope that you guys
enjoyed those suggestions arcus so that
is going to wrap it up for my first
youtube hacks video I really hope that
you guys found this helpful and are able
to take away a few tips and tricks of
mine that I used when I was first
starting YouTube and some that I still
am doing now today if you guys did enjoy
this video I hope you will give it a
thumbs up maybe share it with a friend
if you know someone who is wanting to
get started in YouTube but it hasn't
done it yet
a lot of fun filming it and kind of
showing you guys in an insider look on
how I did things I just remember when I
first got started and having that chair
piled high with books and my husband
making that little piece of wood for me
and I was like yep this is this is gonna
work
this is going to work and sometimes I
would sit across from that set up and
just laugh and be like oh my gosh
because then you would see snaps of the
other bigger youtubers and their full
sets of lighting and their big old
cameras and just their fancy equipment
and I'm like me and I'm gonna get there
one day and it's just a stepping stone
we all have to start somewhere and you
can't be afraid to start you've just got
to go for it so again just look around
your house be creative see what you can
do again and remember what I said at the
beginning of the video that even if it's
not YouTube that you want to do but you
want to start somewhere you want to
start something two of the biggest
things outside of YouTube that I get to
write a book but I don't know how to
start you just have to sit down and
start writing and I want to start yoga
but I don't know where to start you just
have to start practicing Google a couple
of YouTube videos and get to practicing
because I promise you guys if it is
something that you really want to do you
will find the time and you will find a
way to make it work good luck with
whatever it is that you want to do and
just remember you guys are in charge of
your life no one else is gonna make the
change for you you guys gotta do it hope
you found this video helpful I had a lot
of fun filming it for you any sort of
future hacks videos that you'd want to
see please leave them in the comments
