video is going to be about brands that
YouTube introduced me to my high end
video so about a month ago I did this
same video talking about brand said that
I had no idea even existed until I
started watching beauty YouTube videos
and that was focused on drugstore
I asked if you would also want to see
one for high-end and a lot of people
said yes so that is today's video so if
you want to see some brands that I had
no idea existed before YouTube why don't
we go ahead and get started already said
you need to put out a disclaimer that I
am I'm a little bit flustered in today's
video if I seem flustered if I seem off
I woke up not feeling well but also once
I finally got around to start filming my
camera battery just ceased to want to
keep working I've been having some
problems with my camera lately and a lot
of people said it was probably the
battery and the battery just doesn't
work any longer so I actually just had a
drive diversify and get a new battery
come home wait for it to charge now I'm
filming it's 5:30 I never thrown this
late and I have people on both sides of
me doing like yard work and I'm like can
you stop can you just for one site you
stop but I am gonna be gone a couple
days this week so I'm pre filming so I
can spend some time with my family and
have my videos go up like normal so I
did want to get this filmed but
thankfully it's not a bigger issue just
the battery so okay then alrighty so of
course one of the first brands of that I
thought of when I was kind of looking
around at my collection like what brands
did I not know existed before YouTube
definitely one is dose of colors now
dose of colors did launch in 2013 and I
am trying to think of when I got on
YouTube it was I think in 2013 because
it was the same year that I got married
and because I found him through the
makeup artist who was doing my wedding
before my makeup for my wedding she
suggested that I watch you too because I
said that I really wanted to learn how
to do makeup so I was probably on
YouTube around the same time a dose of
colors was launching but especially
because they launched you know they're
an independent brand they were only on
their website for the longest time I
probably never would have discovered
them because they just recently got into
Ulta you know I wouldn't have seen him
at a drugstore or Sephora or anything
like that but there was definitely a lot
of you
tubers that were hyping up dose of
colors a lot and that's kind of how I
discovered the brand I actually waited
patiently until they came in to Alta and
then one dose of colors they were given
to Alta I was so excited and I made a
purchase right away I purchased the
marvelous mops eyeshadow palette and
also one of their liquid lipsticks and
stone these are two of my favorite items
I love them so much I've now gone on to
purchase so many things from dose of
colors and they're definitely favorite
braids of mine but yeah I don't think I
would have known about the brand had it
not been for so many youtubers talking
about him so another brand that I did
not know about until YouTube was a sigma
beauty so I have a couple of my Sigma
brushes here but I really found a sigma
through the YouTube tutorials so many
people were using their brushes and
recommending their brushes and I was
like wait a second I have to you know
check this out what is this brand all
about and I've gone on to really enjoy
Sigma brushes I actually get to be an
affiliate with Sigma which is always so
exciting for me I should have a most
used makeup brushes video that went up
earlier this week as well and you see a
lot of Sigma in there so I'll link that
one in case you want to get to know some
of my favorite Sigma brushes but yeah
they're definitely a brand that I don't
think I would have discovered hadn't
happened for so many youtubers using
them in their videos so the next brand
that I want to talk about is the hooded
beauty so this is another brand that
launched in 2013 so again it was
probably around the same time that I was
getting on YouTube but hooda beauty was
also sold I think it was on her website
and maybe there is one other website but
I can't think of what it is on the top
of my head and it's a website I've
actually never been to so I don't think
I would have known about just hooda in
general or her brand hadn't happened for
watching YouTube and all of a sudden
seeing a lot of hyper on the brand and I
was like amazing it what like I like oh
I want some products from them so some
of the first things that that I bought
from hooda beauty's line is the liquid
lipsticks I have minis here I buy a ton
of her sets and they're one of my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas I've
also recently really been loving her
little eyeshadow palettes the obsessions
eyeshadow palettes this is my latest one
that I purchased this is the coral
obsessions palette and I've been testing
this out like crazy so I can review it
in my Sephora haul follow-up video but I
don't think I would have known about her
beauty had it happen for you too so
another
and here and it's interesting because a
lot of brands that were at Sephora or
are more high-end but they have like
been around for a while I feel like I
kind of already knew about them yeah
like at least some like little inkling
Lord my mom had used their products my
grandmother you surprised my friends at
use their products there was a lot at
first that I thought I could put on this
list but then when I actually sat down
and thought about it I was like no you
know my friend had that palette my
friend had that lipstick my grandma used
that eyeliner you know things like that
so I was like hmm what brands really
were out there but one definitely is
hourglass but I really had no clue about
hourglass until I started watching
YouTube videos and I feel like it was
this guy first that kind of introduced
hourglass to me because when they came
out with their vanish we're like the
vanish stick foundation all of a sudden
so many people were talking about this
guy and so many people were raving about
it and recommending it this is an
expensive guy I don't remember how much
it was I wanna say in the 50 dollar
range maybe maybe even higher I can't
maybe it was in the $50 inning or high
forties I can't remember right now now I
bought it because that's like how much
people were raving about it and I can't
say it's my favorite foundation it's on
the chopping block I know I have a
foundation declutter coming up and I
think I have a good feeling about where
this guy's going but yes so many people
are talking about that I was like I have
to get it and another product brochure
that I feel like gets a lot of attention
that I see a lot in their videos in
youtubers videos is their ambient
lighting you know they have blushes
that's what's here they have their
powders they have bronzers and these
guys are also super expensive I got this
one off glambot cuz I was like those are
so pricey but I actually do like these I
like these quite a bit I like this blush
this is the ethereal glow blush but
again I feel that this is another
product that I see mentioned a lot from
hourglass and YouTube videos but this is
one even though I don't know how long
they've been in Sephora but I know that
they are at Sephora it was never a brand
that I paid any attention to gave a
double take to like I don't even
remember ever seeing them and being
local what's up writing about so
definitely I had to put hourglass in
this video another one would be a milk
makeup I think I wrote down today write
down when milk milk makeup launched in
2016 so this is a newer brand
my first shirt was already on YouTube
but again it's one of those that I felt
like was getting a lot of hype because
of YouTube videos and especially when
the blur stick came out so many people
were talking about this and using it and
raving about it I was like I really want
that blur stick it was on my wish list
for the longest time but I was like I
just don't know like even though
everybody was talking about I was like I
just don't know like will it really work
for me I ended up getting it from milk
makeup which was so exciting and now I'm
super grateful to be on their PR list
and get some of their new releases which
is super cool but I actually do like it
and I've been using it quite a bit this
week too except look my pores are
especially like coming out to party so I
really do like this guy as well but also
their lip color and cream is one of my
go-to lip colors I think it is such a
beautiful lipstick I talked about this
quite frequently I wear it a lot and I
just think it's a great lip color but
even though they were newer brand I feel
and they are in Sephora I feel like
YouTube is the one that really
introduced me to this new brand hey this
new brand is coming out look at the like
a lot of people talk about the packaging
on the milk makeup look at the different
packaging the unique packaging that's
kind of how I really was able to find
out that the brand even launched was
even around was because of YouTube
videos so next time I want to talk about
Laura Mercier this is another brand
that's been around for a while and it's
been in Sephora but I don't think that I
ever knew about Laura Mercier saw anyone
using it having the one in my real life
using it so I never knew of the brand
and I started seeing a lot of people
talk about of course the translucent
powder from Laura Mercier everybody was
using it and one of the first items that
I actually purchased from Laura Mercier
was a seeker brightening powder because
I was really into the bright under eyes
at one point so even though everyone was
raving over the original translucent
powder I was like I'm gonna get the
brightening one in my under eyes are
gonna be like like I went to my under
eyes to be a disco ball at one point
like it was kind of silly but then I
also went on to purchase a or I just got
like a little samples like oh you know
bonus offer or whatever at Sephora and I
got a sample of the flawless fusion at
foundation and I was so surprised at how
much I liked it like so surprised at how
much I liked it because it's full
coverage and long wearing and it's more
of a matte foundation all things that I
don't
necessarily love but I actually really
enjoy that foundation I used my sample
all the way up and I still have that
foundation on my Sephora love's list
considering buying a full-size because
of how much I liked it I also went on
most recently to purchase the flawless
fusion at concealer and I've been
wearing this like mad I did a review on
it and I said I really liked it it's a
nice full coverage but not like too full
coverage of concealer it's super easy to
blend out and I think it looks really
nice on the under eyes so that is Laura
Mercier another brand an expensive brand
this one is a Charlotte Tilbury I don't
think I had ever heard about Charlotte
Tilbury before YouTube and I sat here
and I was wracking my brain like really
never but I was like no I truly don't
think that I had heard of her name
before and I you know was eyeing her
products and you know so many people
were mentioning such great things but
it's also a pretty pricey brand and you
can to get them at Sephora they are on
beauty lush which beauty lush I never
knew about it until you to be there
which i think is fantastic I definitely
stand behind Beauty lash now but I
actually was able to get a PR package
from Charlotte Tilbury which totally
shocked me I can remember getting that
email being like are you are you a
hundred percent on this and I think
they've actually sent me two packages
which is super cool but in one of the
first ones that they sent along the
slight wonder youth boosting a skin
foundation this is one of my favorite
foundations especially for summertime
it's so natural looking on the skin but
also is a little bit radiant at the same
time I was wearing it in a video the
other day and I hadn't busted it out for
a while because it is more of like it's
like a light medium coverage but it's
just super natural like I said and I
just gravitate towards it in the summer
I wore it so often last summer and I
busted it out the other day and put it
on I was like you do like this
foundation but also most recently I did
make a purchase from Beauty leche and I
bought this guy from a Charlotte Tilbury
it is the airbrush flawless F&amp;amp;A airbrush
flawless finish skin perfecting micro
powder boom say that while you're still
flustered over camera battery but so
many people recommend this product dis
ball like this is one of the top
recommended products
I have personally seen from the
Charlotte Tilbury brand so I bought this
setting powder and I really have been
enjoying it for sending on my undereyes
setting my whole face with it I do think
it's a really nice powder but I think
YouTube definitely introduced me to
Charlotte Tilbury thanks for taking my
money something I can have a youtube
introduced me to video without talking
about Natasha de Nona again I really sat
here and thought you've never heard the
name detection or not and I was like no
I'm pretty sure I never have I mean
YouTube definitely introduced me to this
brand because once you start coming out
with those big action of pellets all of
a sudden so many people were talking
about him in a good way and also in a
bad way you know people weren't getting
them and reviewing them but at the same
time people are also like can you
believe someone who's charging that much
money for an eyeshadow palette because
they're big palettes are over $100 and
you know so there's always kind of like
this that's kind of like split I don't
even know if I split down the middle but
you know some people are like these are
the best these are my holy grail these
are great shadows and other people are
like yeah they're okay but they're too
expensive you have that kind of thing so
I feel like YouTube definitely
introduced me to that and I couldn't
purchase anything from Natasha to Donna
because that's just a lot of money for
an eyeshadow palette no matte like as my
makeup clutch grows as my a shuttlepod
growth collection girls and all of that
fun stuff I'm still like that's so much
money for an eyeshadow palette I haven't
been able to do it but I do have the
little mini guy here actually my friend
Candace did send this over to me and
this is the mini sunset palette so it
has five different shades in here and
this was was at $25 and I was like okay
this one I can actually get behind
because $25 I can do I really like many
sizes of things smaller sizes because
I'm very light handed I have a bigger
collection I don't hit pan on things so
this guy works it just fine for me
honestly I would be shocked if I hit pan
on this anyways and I do like these
colors I know not everybody loves this
palette but I do didn't necessarily make
me want to spend over $100 on the big
Natasha palettes no but I like this guy
but youtube definitely had to introduce
me to Natasha to Nona and her pricey
pricey palettes for a fly aways they're
like flying away instead of just sitting
here and watching seeing if my camera is
actually charging I took my daughter for
a walk so I'm like what worse for wear
today okay
moving on I just have two more brands
I'd love to talk about but the next one
is of Jersey art I definitely never
heard of busy art before YouTube and
again it was one of those things where a
lot of people started using the pallets
talking about the pallets but they're
also more expensive pallets like they're
oh I have one right here this one here
is the neutral matte palette so it looks
like this and this is an $80 palette and
they have a couple different variations
of these so a lot of people were talking
about them you know some in a really
good way saying these are the best
shadows that they've ever used the best
mattes that they've ever used but like
oh my gosh it's an $80 palette it's
expensive I did get this gifted to me
from a subscriber which might be you so
happy that I was finally able to try it
out but yeah definitely YouTube
introduced me to them and it kind of
just was the same as a Natasha - no two
people either really love them or people
like them but think they're too
expensive and that's actually the
category that I fall into hell I don't
know why I didn't grab out this palette
to chat about but this palette actually
came in my beauty lish lucky bag so it
was funny that I mentioned Beauty lish
earlier that YouTube introduced me to
them but one of the things that I this I
don't know if this was the first thing
how I heard about Beauty lish because I
feel like maybe I you know saw people
saying well you can order that on Beauty
Lycia that brains on Beauty lish but the
beauty little lucky bag was a really big
thing I think it was two years ago all
of a sudden I was seeing everybody unbox
their beauty list lucky bags out like
what is that so I purchased one the
following year this past year I think
was in January that we got it and
actually a busier palette came in that
which is kind of funny this is their
Theory palette in nuance which looks
like so but yeah definitely YouTube
introduced me to visi art I really had
no clue about the brand before then and
then I just have one more brand to talk
about here and that is cover FX yeah I'm
not sure how new such older brand to
cover FX is but I had never heard
anything about them before YouTube and I
feel like it was really there drops the
custom enhancer drops that everybody
start raking about at once and like
other brands started doing like things
similar to it I feel like that's how I
really got to know cover FX was through
those I do have a little mini guy that
came in like a sample bag once but I'm
just not a big fan of like the liquid
drops like that like I know you can put
in with your foundation you can also use
them as highlight I just
were like a huge fan of it but I
actually went on to purchase there this
is a new product from them it's their
power play foundation I purchased the
Sunday Riley influencer foundation and
the latest vib sale didn't love it I
actually ended up exchanging it from
this which I really do like but I kind
of wish I would have gotten a different
shape match because I wore it the other
day and I was like yeah this is
definitely more of like my pale shade
and you know we're entering the summer
so I get a little bit Tanner in the
summer months so I'm like shoot I might
not be able because I don't even know if
you can tell with the bottle but this
one is in p40 so I'm like oh I don't
know if I'll be able to wear this a lot
in the summer I don't really have to
maybe put those custom enhancer drops in
there you know something like that but I
actually really do quite like this
foundation which is pretty exciting I
think it's a good one but yeah
definitely I did not know about cover
effects before YouTube YouTube
introduced me to them but after that
that is going to do it for today's video
somehow we made it through that okay so
that's gonna be everything for today's
video talking about some high-end brands
that YouTube introduced me to of course
I would love to know what yours in the
description box down below what brands
did you have no idea even exists it was
out there whether they were in Sephora
Ulta whatever you just had no idea I'd
love to know yours it down below again
my apologies for being flustered maybe
looking a little silly and if you heard
any lawnmowers outside I do apologize
but I'm just really really glad that I
was able to get this video filmed and
that my camera wasn't uh you know had
something worse going on with it so
that's a good thing but thank you guys
so much for watching I really do
appreciate it so much if you guys did
enjoyed this video I hope that you'll
give it a thumbs up I hope that you'll
also consider subscribing before you go
and I'll catch you guys in tomorrow's
