I'm really excited to do today's video
because it is going to be a YouTube made
me buy it video so basically I have gone
through my makeup collection and I have
grabbed everything that I have bought
because of YouTube either because I just
kept hearing about the product and
everyone had it and I wanted to have it
I went out and bought it
or products that I picked up
specifically because I wanted to be able
to review them on YouTube and show them
to my subscribers maybe show swatches
get reviews and that sort of thing and
I'm really excited because I actually
had an idea to film a couple different
videos and I wasn't sure which one I
should go with first so I asked my
snapchat BAM and the YouTube made me buy
it was the one that I was like probably
no one's gonna want to see that right
like I thought that would be the one
that got like the least amount of votes
and it actually was like almost a
landslide to do this video and I was
like well this is why I asked my
snapchat BAM questions because you guys
tell me what you want to see so I am so
excited to do this video and also once I
started going through my collection I
was like good that's a lot of products
that I bought because of youtube I have
quite a bit to go through so I probably
am not going to spend a whole lot of
time on each product probably just gonna
show it maybe give a quick reason why
and hopefully try to make this as short
as I can but if you would like to see
all the products of that I bought
because of good ol YouTube please keep
watching go in any specific order I was
trying to put things in order and it
just wasn't working but all of these are
together so let's talk about pellets
bata pellets to get through but the
first one is just my little Z palette
and this is filled with all makeup geek
eyeshadows I just have seven makeup geek
shadows I definitely want more but
makeup geek is one of the first makeup
brands that I purchased on YouTube
because I've heard of them through
YouTube like this isn't something that
you can get at a drugstore you can get
it at Sephora and that sort of thing I
first heard about these through Jaclyn
hill she did a favorites video covering
all her makeup geek eyeshadows and I
went out and bought these all because of
her favorites
I didn't buy all of the favorites that
she had I just picked a few of them and
I love makeup geek eyeshadows they're
affordable they are such good quality
and
I'm gonna pick up more so the next one
is a highlighter palette of course
YouTube made me buy this this is the
Anastacio Beverly Hills
glow kit in that glow it comes with four
different highlighters it looks like
this on the inside she has another one
called gleam and then a brand new one
that I think either just released or is
releasing soon she's got another one
coming out these are incredible I
absolutely love the highlights in these
been obsessed with it since I bought it
another palette is from BH Cosmetics and
this is in collaboration with youtuber
Carli bybel it is our 14 eyes shadow and
highlights palette it looks like this on
the inside
I used this palette so often it is
gorgeous I love being able to buy
products that are in collaboration with
youtubers especially this one Carli
bybel she was the very very first makeup
Beauty youtuber that I started watching
so I got really excited when I saw this
and my mom actually got it for me for my
birthday but I asked my mom to get it
for me for my birthday because of
YouTube another palette that I got just
simply because of youtube I don't know
if I would have picked this up for
myself without being pushed by YouTube
and that is from Kat Von D and it's her
shade + light eye palette and it looks
like this on the inside I just saw so
many different reviews on this and
makeup looks and I was like well wait
like that's actually like super
beautiful
it's an old matte palette which kind of
like freaked me out in the beginning
because I've never really seen anything
like this but I'm so happy I got it and
I use it so often this is a very new
product and of course YouTube made me
buy it it's another collaboration with a
youtuber and this is from Becca
cosmetics and Jaclyn hill it is the
champagne glow face palette so this is a
fairly new product it has a huge mirror
on it but this is what the inside of it
looks like it's got three different
blushes two different highlighters I
love it I also bought champagne pop when
jaclyn hill released just the individual
champagne pop highlighter I bought that
as well this palette is so gorgeous I
think it's sold out but it's going to
come back in the Sephora stores and it
is absolutely beautiful another palette
credited towards YouTube is from Too
Faced this is the sweet peach palette if
you guys follow me on snapchat you would
know how real the struggle was to get
this bad boy but oh my gosh I'm so glad
I did it's gorgeous the first like two
weeks that I had it I could not put this
down and I felt bad because I know not
everyone could get it because it sold
out so fast but I'm hearing that it's
supposed to be coming back so I don't
know we will see it's beautiful it's
gorgeous I've created so many spring and
summer looks with this and I'm so glad I
got it another two palettes that I
picked up because of YouTube are from
morphe morphe is another brand that i
heard of only through youtube again I
first heard about them through Jaclyn
hill and I have come on to love morphe
the two palettes that I have from them
are the three 500 and the 35 see these
35 palettes at 20 bucks or something
435i shadows and their eyeshadows are
high-quality of my makeup look today is
using both the 3500 and the 350 the 3500
is like a cult classic it is always sold
out I had to wait so long to get it
because it kept selling out so fast but
both these palettes from morphe I
absolutely love and speaking of morphia
I also heard how amazing their makeup
brushes were so I bought some makeup
brushes from morphe but they are again
more fee is such a affordable brand that
they have really really affordable and
then they have it just a little bit more
pricey but not to the point of like
high-end or anything their brushes are
some of the best quality brushes that I
have I have done a favorites video for
brushes and a lot of morphe brushes are
mentioned in there I can leave that link
below but yes these morphe brushes
thanks to youtube so another brand that
i heard about thanks to youtube is also
in part to a youtuber and a
collaboration that they did but it is
colour-pop so I have these two mason
jars that are filled with lippie stix
and the ultra matte liquid lipsticks
from a color pop and then I also have
like this little bin here that is filled
with eyeshadows blushes and liners all
from colour-pop I love color pop and
when I say that they are affordable they
are affordable they're lippie stix are
like five dollars the ultra mats are $6
blushes are eight dollars I think I
shadows and the gel liners that I like
are both like five to six dollars apiece
they are amazing I need so much more
color pop in my life they're always
coming out with
thing new they are bomb they are
affordable kathleenlights is how it
first heard about them because she did a
collab with them and I just if you have
not bought anything from colour-pop yet
you need to get on that train so a few
drugstore favorites that I've been
mentioned so often that I had to go out
and buy them one is from Maybelline and
it is their gel eyeliner in blackest
black so many people have used this
Jaclyn hill absolutely race about it I
think I couldn't quite figure out gel
liner when I first started using this I
was still really struggling with gel
liner because I'm a very like makeup
newbie and I think it just dried out on
me too fast which is weird because this
is what the inside looks like which is
weird because so many people say this
doesn't dry out but mine definitely
dried out I was ever able to get a
handle on it I should probably just
throw this away for some reason I just
keep it around but definitely YouTube
made me buy this other item that was
just in so many different makeup
tutorials and I was like I have to get
this so many people are using it is from
NYX Cosmetics it's their jumbo eye
pencil in milk so many people use this
and I get it I use it a lot too so the
inside looks like am i starting to get
like pretty down there I'm gonna need to
order a new one since so many different
tutorials love it I use it so much so I
had never purchased from mac cosmetics
before I got on YouTube and so many
different people were using Mac and I
was like okay I gotta do it the very
first thing that I bought from Mac was
the fix+ so this is like a setting spray
makeup primer spray my hair is on it I
apologize well but this is such a great
spray you can see I've used quite a bit
of it I do have a few other like makeup
sprays now but this is all I use in the
beginning it's great to set makeup to
prime makeup to spray your brushes when
you're using pigments gotta have it
another item that I got from Mac I swear
Carli bybel use this in so many
different tutorials that I was like I'm
just gonna get it it's one of their
pigments and it's in vanilla I do use it
sometimes but not as often as I thought
that I would but honestly there are
pigments I mean I have used this several
times and it's a loose pigment so I
don't want to open it but I don't think
I will ever go through this in my
lifetime ever I feel like even if I
started doing makeup on other people I
would never get through this pigment
there is so much product in here
so a pair of eyelashes that I bought
because of YouTube is from huda beauty
they look like this you know hello
but these are the lashes and Samantha so
many people talked about them I would
see so many different pictures and video
that people doing that and I was like I
want to do that too is there $20 for
lashes and unfortunately I didn't love
them as much as I thought I would I
still prefer just to stick with our doll
lashes but YouTube definitely made me
buy these another item is one of the
very first things that I ordered because
I don't know why I thought when I first
got on here that I would have to like
figure out my eyebrows I don't know why
because I have pretty full eyebrows like
I don't have my eyebrows done today I've
started doing them a little bit more
gotten some pencils but in the beginning
I was like everyone talks about eyebrows
I have to figure it out and it took me
like a year to figure them out but I've
bought this brow bar to go this is
definitely a recommendation from Carli
bybel I know I still see her use them I
ended up using it mostly for was for
eyeshadows so this is actually like a
wax to help hold the brows and I ended
up using this as like a crease shade so
often so not mad that I got it I just
didn't really use it for the purpose
that it was for one is a highlighter
this is a mary lou manizer from the balm
everybody talked about this highlighter
is the first like real highlighter that
i ever purchased it's so beautiful I
still use it gotta love it
another one is a blush this is from
Milani and this is Luminoso everybody
talked about alumino so everybody
suppose you have to have Luminoso and i
swear by it too you need luminoso in
your life this is such a gorgeous peachy
shimmery bronzy blush it's just absolute
perfection one of my absolute fave it
did mention this one earlier but of
course it is the champagne pop from
Becca cosmetics and Jaclyn hill eye I
took me a little bit to purchase it so
it's like forty to forty four dollars
for a highlighter and that was like can
I do it but I finally did it one of my
favorite highlighters and moving on to
some lipsticks I'm trying to go as fast
as I can because we still have so much
to get through but these are from NYX
Cosmetics and these are their soft matte
lip cream so they look like this I have
three
I need like 27 more got
of course YouTube made me buy these I
don't think I would have otherwise but
they are from Kylie cosmetics and Kylie
Jenner I have three of the lip glosses
and one of the liquid lipsticks in candy
kay I bought these specifically to be
able to review them because so many
people had questions about them are they
good quality are they worth it they are
very expensive shipping is very
expensive the only reason that I
purchased them was hands down so I could
do a review on YouTube but I do have a
full review video that I can leave
linked down below if you want to watch
it everybody talked about these two
faced lippies when they came out and
they are the two faced melted lipsticks
they look like this I have three
different shades everybody talked about
these and I was like okay I'm gonna go
get them and unfortunately I didn't end
up loving them I've rarely reached
forums agents are very like runny and
bleed outside your lips and just didn't
really work for me but YouTube hey
everybody another lipstick is from Kat
Von D and mine is in the shade bow and
arrow bow and arrow was one that was so
highly talked about everybody wanted
bone marrow bone era was constantly sold
out everyone talked about the Kat Von D
lippies I finally got bow and arrow in
my most recent Sephora vib sale I
finally bought this and I see what all
the hype was about it's gorgeous
our brands that I heard about because of
YouTube and I purchased because of them
is Gerard cosmetics this is what their
packaging looks like for the lipsticks
they just come in like these like gold
almost like bullet type things I have
three right here I probably have three
other lipsticks I have a few lip glosses
I'm thinking I'm gonna do a little
lipstick declutter video soon and I
actually was going to talk about Gerard
cosmetics but I don't really use them at
all anymore and I've never repurchase
from the brand after I feel like weird
things went down but YouTube made me buy
them so I had to put them in here the
NYC liquid liner looks like this
everybody talks about the NYC liquid
liner and it's so easy for a winged
liner I don't agree with that really the
only thing that I use the NYC liquid
liner for is to apply like on top of my
lash band if I feel like I need to hide
the adhesive on the band a little bit
more but I find this so hard videos
another is from wet and wild it is
the contouring palette I absolutely love
this thing so many people were talking
about it I drove like all over my city
trying to find it so glad I did I use it
all the time this was another one of my
very first purchases that I ever bought
when I started getting into makeup
thanks to youtube is from Rimmel it is
the stay matte translucent powder this
is a powder that I use all the time
under my under eyes to set my concealer
and it's bomb and inexpensive so from
Maybelline everyone for a while was
raving about the fit me line so I went
out and bought quite a bit from the baby
lion can you see all this well I have
three different foundations a powder and
a concealer the fit me line I think is
bomb I love the regular fit means they
now have the matte foundation which is
really good they also have a dewy
foundation they have a powder which I
think is really good as a setting powder
and the concealer is like I think one of
the most talked about concealers on
YouTube - almost gone it's amazing the
Maybelline fit me line YouTube made me
do it
also from Maybelline is the instant age
rewind concealer everybody uses this
everybody raves about it for good reason
I think this is like my third bottle I
go through it so much it's such a bomb
product from L'Oreal I have two
different foundations they are both The
True Match Lumi but this one is the
cushion foundation I think this one was
really really highly talked about for a
while which is why I bought it and then
when this came out like YouTube was all
over this so fast because it is a
cushion foundation it looks like this I
actually have a first impression and
demo review video about it all about it
and everybody loved this foundation I do
too but it's super expensive and it goes
out super quickly I've only had mine for
a few months and it's almost gone I've
had this for probably a year and I still
have a lot left
also some makeup brushes that I
purchased because of YouTube are from
Sigma Sigma was one of the very first
like high-end makeup brushes that I
bought for myself but too very talked
about brushes are the f80 which is the
flat kabuki foundation brush and also
the e25 which is a blending brush i
apologize i just used mine to do this
makeup look but these two brushes are
amazing
I'm really really glad YouTube made me
buy these we have just a few products
left we are almost there one setting
powder is the laura mercier secret
brightening powder everybody talks about
the secret brightening powder
everybody talks about her translucent
setting powder it's just a huge hit and
YouTube made me buy it from Becca
cosmetics this is the backlight priming
filter it looks like this it's just a
like luminous primer it's beautiful it's
gorgeous
I wear it so much then my last two items
I can't believe we're almost there but
there's some of my favorites and I keep
talking about them lately I bought them
both in my latest Sephora vib sale one
is from Tarte it is the rainforest of
the sea aqua concealer everyone was
going crazy over the Tarte rainforest of
the sea line I wanted every single
product that I could purchase out of
there I went with the concealer and I
was not disappointed and the last
product that I have is definitely
YouTube made me buy it this product went
like crazy for a while is from Clinique
it is the beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer so many people were doing
like force impression videos of it and
so many people were saying they loved it
so I picked it up during the sale and it
turned into one of my favorite
foundations wearing it today along with
the tarte concealer and i love it
hi guys and that is gonna be everything
for this video oh my gosh those were so
many products I can't believe YouTube
made me buy all of that I didn't even
touch on skincare I really didn't even
go into any of my other like beauty
tools besides a couple brushes that I
wanted to specifically mention I didn't
talk about haircare I didn't talk about
makeup organization I only tried to go
