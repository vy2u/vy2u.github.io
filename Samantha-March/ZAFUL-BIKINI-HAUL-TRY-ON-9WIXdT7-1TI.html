today's video is going to be a bikini
haul and try on video I'm really excited
for this video I've never done a
swimsuit haul and clothing hauls in the
past but I've never done one focused on
swimsuits so I'm super pumped for this
video both these swimsuits are going to
be from the online retailer saffle and
I'm really excited to work with them on
this video is in a collaboration with is
Apple so I'm really excited about that I
have seen some of my other youtube
friends especially my friend Valerie
pack she has worked with them a lot and
I know she's had really good things to
say about them so when they reach out to
me and asked if I'd want to do is from
City Hall I was like okay let's do it
I love swimsuits I love warm weather I
live in Iowa so we don't get that a
whole lot but I was excited to be able
to pick out some new bikinis and I'm
excited to show you guys what I got when
I first went to the website check them
out make sure I felt the vibe with them
make sure I was able to find some suits
that I like what actually wanted I was
overwhelmed in a very good way they have
a lot to offer on their website but
bikini wise they have pages and pages
and pages of bikinis like it was not an
issue for me to pick some foods out I
have 11 bikinis that I'm going to show
you here you guys like I had no problems
with it one of the best parts was like
there's a super trendy swimsuit super
cute many of them were so I caching to
me a ton of different styles and that I
really really enjoyed like no matter
what color style print top bottom
whatever it is that you want you were
probably going to be able to find it on
that website which I thought was really
cool but their prices were like
unbeatable like I said I live in Iowa so
it's not like I'm at the beach all the
time are laying out at a pool we only
get a couple months to enjoy that I'm
sure I can take vacations here and there
but I would not say I wear a bikini on
the regular and sometimes it's hard for
me to justify the price of a swimsuit
like I buy a lot of my swimsuit at
Victoria's Secret and sometimes it's
really hard for me to justify their high
prices but I'm like you know I have a
couple bikinis that I bought that were
really pricey and I've worn them like
twice simply because I don't get to go
out and wear them a lot so the prices on
these I think most of them for
that were like 11 to 15 dollars for a
top and bottom and I thought that was
amazing the price is both vary by what
some said that you want but I will also
have some promo codes down in the
description box down below is Apple did
let me know that they have some
promotions that they are running learn
affiliate codes or anything like that
they just wanted me to pass that along
to you guys the only real con that I
would say about Apple is that you can't
order different sizes and tops and
bottoms you order everything as a set so
if you want a medium you have to have
medium top and bottom for me it's kind
of hard because I usually wear a small
top and a medium bottom so it was a
little tough for me ordering is the only
part for me that was like kind of a
downfall but I think most the majority
of the swimsuits ended up working really
well for me the other thing I will say
is that when I saw the prices I merely
kind of thought quality you know are we
going to get good quality swimsuits and
I'm happy to say that I was impressed
with the quality of all of them I
actually is just getting back from a
vacation I know I feel like in my videos
the last couple that I filmed like I
don't have a full face of makeup on
still like settling down from getting
home after being gone for five days
having my Instagram account disappear my
Instagram account has reappeared so
that's good but I'm still I'm very tired
I'm getting back in the swing of things
but I'm still wanting to record some
videos but like I was saying I was on
vacation and I actually took a couple of
these swimsuits with me I'll let you
guys know which ones I did so I was
actually able to test them out in the
waters in hot tubs on water side and
overall I was very impressed with all of
them so I'm really excited to share this
video with you guys thank you so much to
example for reaching out for me and for
sponsoring this video I'm super
appreciative to them for that but
without further ado why don't I go ahead
and hop into the bikinis that I chose so
the first one that I picked out is a
green and white bikini so this is what
the top looks like and they have the
little straps like that it's just like a
very small piece of padding in the chest
area which i think is good especially
with the white because sometimes like I
feel like you need that with the white
bikini tops if you know what I'm saying
but it's nothing like super extreme
or anything like that these are what the
bottoms look like I love the bottom so
much I love the different sides here
I did get these in the medium so the top
is almost just a little bit too big for
me but what I really liked is that that
you have adjustable straps right here so
when I am actually going to wear this
one I would have like my husband or a
friend tighten it for me and I think
that's great because I know once I do
that the tubble fit me a lot better it's
more like around where I need a small
because I'm kind of smaller around but
other than that it fit me really well
and the bottom sent me really well also
so that was my first one and I really
enjoyed it I love this color as well ice
when I got in a black bikini top so this
is what the top looks like and then the
chest area and this one is pretty padded
it reminds me like almost kind of like
the bombshell bra from Victoria's Secret
but not quite to that extreme like that
takes you up like two cup sizes or
whatever I didn't feel it was like that
extreme but it definitely gives you a
lift and some good support to ties at
the top in a regular halter style but I
thought of this part if I can show you
that is good enough was really cool
because it kind of came down and then it
would tie in the back I thought it was
really pretty on I really enjoyed it
this one is a medium as well so again
it's a little bit too big for me
around the size size need to like just
make sure I tie it really tight but
other than that it fit me really nicely
everywhere else the bottom these
actually came along with me on my
vacation but they are just blocked in
white stripes and then it has this
little detail on the sides these came
with me on vacation these came with me
when we did when we stayed at the hotel
that had into our water slides it came
with water slides with me I didn't lose
my bottoms at all everything was good
there was no like I've gotten swimsuits
before and then I've gone in a pool or
hot tub and they discolor the actual
swimsuit I don't know if anyone's ever
had that happened to them but I
definitely have and nothing was
discolored at all everything held up
really great and these bottoms were
bum cell I was really happy with the
zucchini I think it's super cute so the
next one I took out I really loved this
kind of like camel color this is what
the top looks like again and there's
just that little bit of padding in the
chest area nothing too extreme too crazy
but I really liked all the fun strap it
hop is really like how funky in the back
with the strap I was doing the Tryon by
myself I typically film by myself while
my husband is at work during the day and
it was hard to tie it myself if I have
someone else there to help me I feel
like I'd be able to tie it a lot better
and the the detail I just thought was
super cool in the back and it also does
have this little peekaboo right here in
the chest as well these are what the
matching bottoms look like so again the
side detail here I did order this one in
a small so the top fits me really well
all around it felt like the top works
really well at the bottom for a little
bit small a little bit on the cheeky
side but I still like them and I
definitely still wear this one so I have
a handful some suits that I'm not
actually able to insert the Tryon Clips
because they either like didn't fit me
or things like that this one next I'm
going to show you the top didn't fit me
super well it works well enough that
it's like I was at an adult resort or
something with my husband and we were
going in like a pool I wouldn't feel
like bad wearing it but for a youtube
video or like even if I was going to
like a public pool of kids I probably
wouldn't wear this one just because the
top is actually really really small and
it was interesting to me as I actually
ordered this one in a medium but the
actual like cup sizes for the breath
it's just like too small so I'm not able
to actually insert that clip because
that's not that's not how I do things
but this is what the bikini top looks
like and it's interesting to me because
I don't even feel like the cups look
like they're that small but once I put
it on it just it was a little crazy but
I really liked it because I liked the
back detail and I just thought that was
super cute like I said I would wear this
at like an adult resort or things like
that I was even just like at my own
house like sometimes I'll sit and in the
summer I'll take my laptop out I'll sit
on our deck in a bikini and work on my
computer and read books and things like
that I would do that bed but if I was
going to be
rob was like she'll turn and things like
that I'm not going to do it and I don't
want to put that in a YouTube video but
I still thought it was super cute and I
wanted to show you guys I just thought
it was interesting being a medium of
like there's no way as small like a
small wouldn't even be an appropriate
size for me and then these are at the
bottom slick life they are very cheeky
bottoms as well so they kind of show a
lot and that's what the sides look like
so this one is definitely more of an
adult bikini but it's not really like I
thought it was cute and I really liked
the colour as well next one I have is
this one right here so it's a really
pretty
I liked the green color and I really
liked it and I liked the detail of what
the crisscross in the middle there I
thought that was really fun and then
this is what the back looks like again
there's just that like little bit of
padding in the chest area not too much
but enough to give some coverage which I
appreciate it and I really liked the
bottoms this is what they look like and
I like them because they were just like
you know kind of like the plain buttons
a lot of the ones that I've got has like
this on sides or you know things like
that and I think I have a lot of those
in my collection anyway so to just have
like kind of a more regular pair of
bottoms I kind of appreciated that they
are a little bit more on the cheeky side
as well this set is in a size small
which actually I thought the top was a
little bit bigger for being a small the
bottoms definitely seems up this small
to me the top I thought looks a little
bit on the big side but I really liked
it I really liked it the color of this
one too I thought this was a fun one
this next one ended up being a favorite
of mine I could get with me on my
vacation so this one is what the tab
looks like it is a black and white top
and I thought it was cool because it
ties in the back like a regular and then
it has these white straps that go over
the shoulder but then it has this black
strap that ties as a halter in the neck
I thought it was really cool my friend
was with me and she gave me a compliment
on it when I wore it the one day I
thought it was just really like fun and
unique and different and I like the
halter because it kind of like secured
everything else in because just with the
white straps it was like a little bit
looser but then once you add it the
halter around the neck like everything
is kind of fell into place and I enjoyed
that about it
also in a small and I thought it fit me
really well but then the bottoms I also
thought were way cute I was super happy
with these bottoms so that is what they
look like they will probably able to see
it in the actual Tryon better but I just
really liked with the cutout and the
black and white kind of like going
diagonally at each other I really like
these bottoms I also thought they fit
really well too
most of the bottoms that I've got are
you know pretty on the cheeky side which
this one kind of blends but also I felt
like it gave you more coverage in actual
like booty area it's a little bit
smaller for the front of the bikini but
for the actual like booty area I thought
it gave pretty good coverage so this was
definitely a standout for me this is one
of my favorites and I'm really excited
to wear this this summer
so I have two more that I'm not able to
do the Tryon clips in a year and it was
because I could not get these swimsuits
on for the life of me I know if I have a
friend or my husband here helping me we
would be able to get it but I was
filming by myself and it was very
complicated to try and tie all of these
pieces together and get it fitting right
and I also filmed the triumph portion of
this video the day that we were leaving
for vacation we left at 1 o'clock I was
in my bikini filming this Tryon portion
at 10:30 in the morning it was I don't
know why I thought that was a good idea
but I did but so this is one of the
bikini tops
I mean I'll insert a picture from the
website so you can see what should
actually look like and even I went to
the website I was like ok I need to tie
it and I need to tie it again and if I
can get help I know that I'll be able to
get into it but trying to do it with
hands and then tying and it didn't
really work out for me but the pinter it
looks super cute I'll not be able to get
it with some help I really liked this
kind of burgundy color and then the
bottoms I also thought were really cute
as well I got this set in a size medium
so this is what the bottoms look like
and there is the side detail so y'all
insert a photo here when I couldn't do
it by myself by the other one I wasn't
able to do myself it's basically the
exact same top except it is in black so
kind of it ties around the neck and then
it will wrap a couple times around the
stomach which I thought that detail was
super cool you'll get some awesome
lines from this one I just thought it
would be you know kind of fun and
different so this was in a size small
but then I liked at the bottom because
they were more of like the print bottom
and I just thought that these were super
cute I liked this one print on there a
little bit more cheeky as well and again
a size small so I think this will look
really cute together as well I kind of
like the mismatching I don't like
mismatched my swimsuits a lot and you
know like you can see the majority of
some suits they actually do match within
a few of them don't and I kind of like
that part about it so that was another
one but I couldn't quite get over myself
so this next one ended up being another
favorite of mine and I was a little bit
surprised at it to be honest because
this is what the top looks like so it's
not a traditional some to a
non-traditional bikini it's more of a
crop top and it says Sunchaser on it
it's black with the white print so it
just looks like that and I got it except
like well you know I don't have anything
like that it would be fun to try and
when I put it on I immediately it was
like yes I really like this it feels
kind of like a wet suit type of material
I would say like it's super tight you
don't have to worry like you're not
going to lift your arms and the shirts
going to go with you or anything like
that it was super tight but it's still
comfortable at the same time but I felt
like it was holding everything in it
wasn't like I was wearing a tank top
with no bra because that would be super
uncomfortable I really liked this one I
was really happy with that I thought
that was so cute I can't wait to wear
this summer like I'll wear it as a
bikini alert as a shirt I just thought
it was super cute but then also the
bottoms really got to me too and the
bottoms came along with me on my
vacation as well and these are what the
bottoms look like so I just thought that
print detail was super cute really liked
them again took these on vacation when
the hot tub with these I had no problems
at all with them this one was a size
medium but I was really happy with this
I really liked this fun we're almost and
we just got two more left so this is the
next one again it's kind of like that
more camel color like small triangle
bikini top a little bit of padding in it
not too much but I like this one because
it also does have the adjustable straps
which I just think is really helpful
even though this is a size small so it
fit me pretty fine in the top area and
then these are what the bottoms look
like I just thought they were super cute
I loved
kind of Marv like a braid detail on the
side I actually love the color kind with
the more camel type of color I thought
it was super cute so the last one that I
have to show you is definitely I think
probably one of the more unique ones
from the collection it's definitely most
unique to my swimsuit collection in
general so this one is what it looks
like it has like the floral print and it
has the detail in the middle there but
it actually has kind of like the sleeves
and I'll be able to insert what it looks
like on me and then it ties it has this
long time because you can tie it around
your stomach a couple times I wasn't
sure what I was going to think of this
one and when I got it I was like okay
let me just let me just try it on and
see and I really liked it I just thought
it was really different and just a lot
of fun and like I said just something
more unique to wear so I thought it was
super fun like for pool parties and
things like that I would totally wear
this one I really liked the detail as
well that you could tied around your
stomach I just thought that was super
fun so I was really happy with this one
buttons are almost sung bottoms I mean
they're there they're pretty much there
and they just have the one strap on the
side so the bottoms are really really
small and I did get this set in a size
small so I don't know if I'm like daring
enough to wear these bottoms anywhere
maybe if we were like on vacation or
something like that the bottoms are
definitely pretty darn small but I just
I loved at the top I will definitely be
wearing the top the super excited about
that as something a little bit different
to my collection and that is going to be
it for this bikini haul okay so that's
going to do it for my bikini haul and
try on it featuring all these bikinis
from is Apple again a big thank you to
them for reaching ask me and for sending
me these swimsuits and bringing you this
video I was very excited to work with
them I know I've seen a lot of great
videos about them and I think they're
kind of like most well-known for their
swimsuit selection and their bikinis I
hope that my try ons helped and kind of
my feedback on each one I hope that
helps you guys out if there's any that
you are thinking of getting like I said
they have so many options on their
website it does no matter what it is you
want you are going to get it and the
prices I just think are kind of
unbeatable I'm not just saying this
because that's will work with me on this
video but because of the quality that
I've experienced and because of
Isis on the website this is where I want
to get my swimsuits now I feel like I
don't need to go to Victoria's Secret
and honestly I feel like you're getting
a bigger selection there and they're
just kind of trendier pieces there was
qualities about each of the swimsuits
that I just absolutely adored and I'm
really excited to wear all of them but
in general like if I were to have
purchased these what I do 11 bikinis I
don't think I would have returned any of
them which i think is awesome again the
only like downfall of it is that you
can't mix and match your sizes but I had
pretty good luck with all of these that
I ordered so overall I was really happy
with that I'm really excited to add some
bikinis to my collection but that's
going to do it for this video I hope
that you guys enjoyed it hopefully you
found it helpful let me know have you
