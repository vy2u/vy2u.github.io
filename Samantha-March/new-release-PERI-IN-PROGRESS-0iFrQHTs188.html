book is a Perry in progress that is what
the cover looks like I apologize i don't
have the print copy yet it takes us a
while to get even like the proof print
copy the the print file is the last one
that i receive from our formatter and
then you have to upload everything to
create space you have to wait a few days
to get it approved then you need to get
the proof got be shipped to you so it
just takes a while so we don't have that
yet but that is what the cover looks
like no I'm really excited for cat this
is her third book she also has out
breaking the rules which this is her
debut novel and then she also has zoe
and the moment of Zen and this book just
celebrated its to your book birthday
which is really exciting and now she is
adding perry and progress to the family

well right now it's on Goodreads it I
think we're going to have it on
pre-order soon but it will be on sale
November 11th but cat has a holiday
novella in there as well called a nine
ladies dancing so I'm just I'm so
excited for cat she was the first author
to sign with a marching ink when it was
really just a very small idea in my head
and cat asked me um she hired me to be
her editor for breaking the rules and I
read it and I just I felt so in love
with it and I asked her if she would
want to take a chance on a girl working
out of her budget
and she said yes and now we are on book
number three with Kat and it's just so
amazing i love working with her she is
such a nice person she cares about her
books so much she cares so much about
writing them she cares so much about the
quality of them she just she cares so
much about her books and that is just
such a fantastic quality about an author
I have had the privilege to meet Kat
twice once in Canada and once in New
York each for like book signings that we
did and I just it was so incredible to
be able to meet her so I'm just I'm so

you will but to give you a little idea
um I probably don't need to read the
whole blurb to you but basically so we
follow Perry and the book is focus so
I'm already laughing as i'm trying to
like get into explaining the start to so
we follow perry she is our main
character she basically gets the idea
that she needs to like change her life
around she needs make changes in her
life for the better and she wants to
start off by having her relationship go
public she is in like a secret
relationship with a guy at her work
because she's like technically his boss
so they haven't come out to anyone and
the moment that she decides to do that
things just kind of go downhill for her
and that's kind of where it starts off
but she has that whole issue happening
and then I'm trying to sign how much I
want to give away about the book I
really don't want to get boy much
because it is so much fun to read but so
she has that happening then she has her
best friend Elsa else's brother moves
back into town he is like a like a
famous chefs from
ibiza he comes back to the states and
he's with his family but no one really
knows like why he came back he's very
secretive about it him an alpha his
sister they don't get along there's
issues with their parents divorce and
what Milo decided to do and what Elsa
decided to do that they don't see eye to
eye on that but slowly Perry gets
involved in a way with Milo with his
restaurant and she's kind of keeping
secrets from her friend she doesn't know
what to do about her job she doesn't
know what to do about her relationship
she doesn't have to do about Milo to you
know to top it all off she is trying to
train for a 5k that she's not into her
house is always falling apart she's
always having problems with her house
that she bought and it is just true
