today's video is going to be very
different from anything that I have put
out on my channel before I'm excited for
this video I'm a little bit nervous for
it because I'm going to be doing some
real talk here with you I also will not
be putting any makeup of my face which
makes me quite nervous as well and a
little bit nervous to make the video but
like i said i also am very excited
because i want to talk to you guys about
a subject that i feel very passionate
about i think what i am going to call
this video is maybe like the real reason
why i started youtube that's kind of its
than what's in my mind when I've been
thinking about doing this video I have
been meaning to sit down and do kind of
like a chit chat video for quite some
time but I had so many ideas of what I
could have the underlying theme be and
just none of them either felt right or
the timing didn't feel right or
something was happening where I was like
you know what I just I just don't feel
that this is the right time to put this
video out and for probably about the
past two weeks I've been thinking about
the certain subject and I've been
talking to a couple different people
about it and that you know the words
that I keep saying I'm like I should
really film that as the video like that
that's what my subject needs to be
that's what I need to talk about so I'm
excited to share with you guys the real
reason that I start at YouTube and not
only YouTube but social media because I
have been in the social media game for a
long long time now hasn't been an easy
journey for me and I feel like I'm
finally just now just now getting it
figured out and finding my own path to
you know being happy and living my life
the way that I want to live it so I'm
excited to talk to you guys about the
subject so like I said I'm going to be
talking about why i started youtube why
i started social media so the first
thing that I kind of want to talk about
or address is give a little bit of a
backstory for those of you who do not
know me maybe this is your first time on
my channel if it is welcome hello my
name is Samantha maybe you've been
around for a while
but you don't know my backstory so
basically everything kind of started for
me in 2009 I was still in college at the
time but it was always a really big goal
in my life to publish a book I've always
wanted to be a published author since
the time I was nine years old it's
documented in my like memory books of
what do you want to be when you get
older I want to be a writer want to be
an author want to write books and I told
myself that I need to go to a real
college and once I graduated from
college with a degree if I still wanted
to pursue writing I could so it was
before I graduated college was my last
year of college that I decided I was
going to start writing my book because I
still felt very passionately about it
but you know the advice that you always
hear like I would always hear my mom
saying it is it's not what you know it's
who you know and I thought well I don't
know anybody so how do i how do I get to
know people and I decided to start a
blog so one of the reasons that I
started my blog was to try to make more
connections with people especially
authors and maybe get some help when it
came to publishing my book because I
really had no idea what I was doing so
that was a really big reason that I
started my blog another reason that I
decided to start my blog and what I was
going to make it on was because I wanted
to meet people who thought the same as I
did as I have felt different my whole
life I felt like I never had the same
mindset as anyone else and I could never
find people who thought like me we just
did not have similarities and I mean
through middle school through high
school and even in college I was like
why am I so different and you know why
can't I find someone out there same as I
do or who wants what i want i just i
could never find people like that you
know another really big reason for me
starting my blog was too maybe i can
finally find people out there like me
because it's so frustrating to live your
whole life feeling so different because
you know people don't like different and
when you're different you get made fun
of i was always a really big challenge
for me and a big struggle for me because
of that
thought you know maybe if I start this I
will finally be able to meet people so i
started my blog in october of 2009 is
called chiclet plus it is still up today
it is running I will leave a link down
below if you want to check it out and my
overall envision for my blog was to do
everything that I loved and have it in a
website that was my like goal for
chiclet pluses anything that I have an
interest in or passionate or a hobby of
mine I want to put it onto that website
so that included books that included it
talking about celebrities and include it
fashion Fitness beauty makeup lifestyle
like I wanted it all to be on chocolate
plus so I was so excited you know I
hired someone to do like the creative
work and actually build a website for me
because had no idea what I was doing and
I just started going after it I mean if
a celebrity was getting married I was
writing an article about that if a
friend was making a delicious dessert I
asked for the recipe and made it I had
just picked up a new eye shadow I would
do a review on it and that is how
Chiclets plus came to and I was having
so much fun with it until all of this
negativity started coming in so it was
about a year after i started chiclet
plus and the books and triplet plus was
going really well within the first six
months of me starting that web site and
reviewing books I was being contacted by
emily giffin by Jackie Collins but
really big name authors contacted by
their publicist to be able to review
their books and interview these authors
and it was amazing I was getting so many
review requests coming in from publicist
and authors themselves and it was really
really exciting and I was also getting a
lot of help because I was finishing
writing my own book at this time I was
getting a lot of help from authors of
what my next steps would be if I would
self-publish if I would try to find an
agent and you know editors and
proofreaders recommendations and it was
fantastic and then around the time where
I started to get serious you know I had
a book cover and you know my book is
going to come out soon my books you know
done being edited my debut novel is
going to come out soon all of a sudden
there was a lot of
tivity around Chiclets plus and it was
really hard to deal with because the
comments that were coming in were saying
things like no one's going to take you
seriously as an author if you continue
to talk about makeup and no one's going
to take you seriously in your writing
career if you post the pictures of the
outfit that you're wearing that day and
I let those comments get to me so much
that I basically shut everything down it
was probably within two years of
starting Chiclets plus I basically shut
everything else down besides books and
focused solely on books because these
comments were so hurtful to me but also
because I believed them I believed that
if I wanted to be an author which is
what I've wanted to be since I was a
little girl that I couldn't do anything
else I couldn't be anybody else I had to
just be an author I had to just be into
books I had to just be a book lover I
could not have any other passions
outside of that because I let these
people who would leave these rude and
nasty comments I let them change who I
was honestly like saying those words out
loud still is so crazy to me that I
would let anonymous people you know
sometimes I actually did kind of know
people who were saying this or I would
get emails from even like fellow authors
and they would say you know I just want
to give you some constructive criticism
but if you want to be taken seriously
you know you can't do all that other
side stuff no one cares about your
recipes no one cares about what you're
wearing you need to just focus on your
books that needs to be your main thing
so I was letting anonymous people and
even people that I thought were my
friends and like you know almost kind of
like colleagues and the industry I let
them change my mindset and change what I
had initially started out to do is
really really disheartening but I did it
I change I'm a chiclet plus into
primarily a book blog I hired on a whole
slew of reviewer so we could keep
putting out in many book reviews as we
could and I went down a path that made
me so happy I'm not gonna lie it made me
happy i have four books published under
my name right now i started a publishing
company you know those years were great
i was doing something that I
I really love to do and I was expanding
in a way that I never knew that I could
but at the same time I wasn't being
completely fulfilled because I had let
other people changed my mindset and
change who I think that I needed to be
so after a couple years of this I
thought to myself you know what I want I
want to give other things a shot because
I'm more than just a book lover you know
that was the idea behind starting
chiclet plus is being able to take all
of my passions into one and put it into
one place and be that person like why
can't I be all of that so in 2013 I
thought you know what I'm gonna I'm
gonna try again I'm going to kind of
redo chiclet plus i'm going to put back
in the post that i wanted to write and
like you know i just want to be more i
wasn't being entirely fulfilled so I
thought I need to be more well in summer
2013 I was newly engaged and I was so
excited to be planning my wedding and to
you know taking a next step in my life
it was so exciting but I was still
really struggling and I would talk to my
fiance about it quite frequently about
now how I just wasn't happy and I can
remember having a moment where like I
had a complete breakdown because I said
I'm just not happy with what my life you
know with my professional life I'm not
doing enough haven't done enough I
should be doing more and he was saying
to me he's like you know you published a
book like that's always your dream you
have a business like you are doing big
things you know what more could you
possibly want and I just said I don't
know but there's something else out
there like I should be doing something
more again and in 2013 I thought you
know what I you know my website has
gotten completely away from my original
vision it's completely gone off that
because you know I let other people's
comments influenced me so much so I
thought you know what I'm going to try
to get it back I hired someone to do a
redesign on Chiclets plus we change the
banner we added in items like Fitness
items and you know pair of heels and
things like that because you know I was
like I want this website to be
all you know girly things I don't want
it to be just booked because that's what
I never I never intended it for it to be
that way so we did a little redesign I
brought back in beauty articles I asked
you know some of my associate reviewers
you know hey if you ever want to write a
beauty review or you know you just have
anything else that you want to talk
about a movie review anything let me
know and let's start doing stuff like
that too and I also set up a camera and
my spare bedroom one day and sat down in
films more like beauty and lifestyle
videos and I started a YouTube channel
you know being on YouTube in 2013 you
know there weren't these big huge booty
influencers that I was really looking up
to I really didn't know I didn't know
anyone else personally that was on
YouTube and I didn't know anyone else
like I do today like how you can watch
the big-name youtubers on there that
wasn't around or at least I had not
found it yet when I had started to do it
but I thought maybe this could be a way
that i can try something new or I could
reach more people or just you know help
me get on the right path again and so I
did about five videos of so excited
about them i would share them on my
social media accounts and the feedback
once again wasn't great and it was hard
because even people in my real life or
like why are you doing that you know why
would you make a video and put it on
youtube like only weird people do that
also let me believe like yeah duh I'm
being stupid why would I do that but
then also the online comments of once
again you know people aren't going to
buy your books if you're going to start
talking about makeup you're not going to
be taken seriously and I just that's the
number one comment that I always guy
you're not going to be taken seriously
you're not going to be taken seriously
it's like why I mean I just you know now
I'm like why don't I don't understand it
but back then I was like you know this
could you know maybe ruin everything
that I have you know worked these past
years for you know publishing books and
I'm a publisher and I offer all these
services do you know what do people
won't take me seriously anymore they
don't want to read my books anymore
they're not gonna buy my books anymore
like okay so once again I listened to
those comments even though I told myself
you know you're going to do it you're
going to make this change because you're
going to be happier I want
again I lost it a las it and it's so
frustrating to say but after about five
videos I deleted all of them and I
deleted the youtube channel and I
thought you know what nevermind like
let's just we gotta get it together we
gotta focus on books focus on writing
books and book reviews um you know once
again like every once in a while I would
sprinkle in some sort of different type
of review or something on chocolate plus
but not very often those kind of
dwindled away again it was really
disappointing kind of like the main
topic that I want to talk about here was
why i got on youtube now I kind of told
you about why I started social media and
and those sort of reasons but now I want
to talk about why I actually started
this YouTube channel and what I was
hoping to get out of it and once again
my mindset was i'm not happy i'm still
not happy i'm still not completely
fulfilled with my life what can i do
differently and I need to make something
stick you know so once again I went back
to I want to be more than just an author
I want to be more than just a book
blogger I want to be able to share my
different passions and my different
hobbies with people because once again I
want to be able to talk with other
people about that because again you know
it just goes back to always feeling so
different and always feeling like you
don't belong anywhere because you can't
find people who are like-minded like you
and certain areas and i thought you know
i gotta i gotta be able to find them
like my world completely opened up when
i started chiclet plus i've made some
amazing friends and the book community
gone on trips together I've been to
their house like it's just it's really
amazing what social media did for me in
that aspect that it opened up my world
so completely I mean I always say that
starting chiclet plus literally changed
my life I mean it did it changed my life
and it made it so much better but I knew
that there was still something more out
there for me and that I wasn't being
completely fulfilled so in the summer of
2015 I thought you know what I'm going
to start to try to do YouTube again
someone recommend it carli bybel to me
and I was saying how he's always so
frustrated like I love makeup so much i
love by
makeup but I don't know how to do it I
can't figure out how to do it and
someone said well I watched carli bybel
on YouTube and she does really good
tutorials and that was like what what do
you mean and so I went to youtube and i
searched carli bybel and i started
watching her videos and I was like you
can learn how to do makeup on youtube I
had no idea so I watched you know a
handful of Carly's videos and I think
through Carly I also found like Nicole
Guerrero and then I found jaclyn hill
and just all these people who would just
sit down and talk to a camera about the
things that they were passionate about
and they would do reviews and they would
show tutorials and through youtube I
learned how to do makeup I did not know
how to do makeup before then please
watch my how I did my makeup in college
video because that's proof I was
watching it I was not only so inspired
and so motivated but I just kept
thinking to myself I can do that too I
love reviewing products that's you know
that's what chiclet plus is I was
reviewing books and you know back in the
day I was reviewing beauty and skincare
and haircare like why can't I do that
and you know it took me about two like I
said I think it was two months after I
watched Carly's video for the first time
and I just kept thinking to myself I can
do that I can do that I was so
determined this time to not give up on
myself early I was you know I have the
mindset i had the focus of if i want to
finally figure out how to be happy I
need to not stop when times get rough or
people are nasty like you've got to keep
it gone Samantha so that is what i did i
think it was summer of 2015 that i
posted my first video it's kind of
confusing to me because even though i
had like the great book side of things
going and I want it to incorporate
beauty and makeup I thought once again I
had those little voices I care like you
won't be taken seriously like don't
don't lose your book stuff and so I
thought okay I'll make a mostly book
focused channel but i'll incorporate a
little bit of beauty so i think what i
did the beginning was i did like to book
videos to everyone beauty video and what
I very very quickly realized was that my
beauty videos had a much better response
than my book videos which was very
confusing to me because I had been in
book industry for so long and I had you
know quite a few very loyal followers on
my other social media pages and they you
know not everyone was not being
supportive but I did not get a lot of
support on the book videos and I thought
well this is really strange but my
beauty videos were getting support from
other Beauty lovers from all around the
world who had no idea who I was and
hadn't been following me on social media
for years and hadn't read my books but
i'll send they were watching my beauty
videos and i thought well this is very
confusing what what should I do with
this and so I started to do books and
beauty videos half and half I was like
okay I'll just split it half and half
I'll do have books half makeup and it'll
be fantastic and still the beauty videos
had so many more views more comments
more likes than the book videos and I
kept you know I'm watching my analytics
page and I'm and trying to think this
through because it really threw me
through a loop I was very confused I
still kind of end to this day so I
started to incorporate more makeup I
started doing more makeup videos and
just a few book videos you know like to
beauty to one book videos and again I
mean the makeup videos were just blowing
it out of the water and then I would
post his book video and it would have
like barely any views and I'm like I am
actually like really killing my
statistics every time I put a book video
up because no one's watching it but the
next day I can do a beauty review video
and it's getting you know hundreds views
and so I thought about it for a while
and it was a really hard decision to
make but I was like you know what I'm
going to relaunch my channel and make it
an all beauty channel like why not I I
have this this blog that's been
dedicated to books for so many years I
have these social media platforms that
I've dedicated to books for so many
years this is my chance and like when I
had that light bulb moment go off of
this is my chance to finally be able to
merge everything together and be who I
want to be finally I got it hey I got to
take it I got to take that risk it was
very scary because once again I was
afraid I'd get those comments and once
again I did get those comments of why
are you only doing beauty now what
happened to your books do you not read
anymore you know
right anymore no one's gonna take you
seriously all of those comments did come
in and I brushed all those comments off
and I am so proud of myself for doing it
and for finally after so many attempts
of trying to be who I really wanted to
be I finally said you know what haters
I'm not listening to you anymore because
I'm going to be who I want to be I am so
proud of myself that I was able to not
let those comments get to me i was able
to relaunch youtube into who i wanted it
to be and do the videos that were
important to me and be able to find that
balance and it made me so happy
definitely been a long journey from 2009
and having an original vision for myself
and for what I kind of wanted to be able
to create on my own to 2016 and finally
saying hey I think I figured it out guys
Here I am I recently did another
complete redesign on chiclet plus and
while the actual content and posts that
I'm posting on Chiclets plus are mainly
geared toward books if you go to the
website you will see my Instagram on
there you will see my youtube on there
you will see the different parts of my
life are now incorporated into Chiclets
plus where I'm not getting rid of
anything I'm not not reading books
anymore not not publishing my own books
I'm not getting rid of any of that part
of my life because that part of my life
is so important to me so special to me
and an absolute passion of mine but it
doesn't mean that that's the only thing
that I have to do I have this a whole
other passion in my life and now that I
have finally found an outlet to be able
to do that makes me so incredibly happy
having an absolute blast here on YouTube
once I relaunched my channel in May of
2016 I have had such a good time being
on YouTube I love filming videos it's a
fantastic outlet for me also what's made
me so happy is that I continue to find
other people that I can talk to about my
passions I can find people to talk about
books with I can find people to talk
about booty with but I can also find
people that are like me and have so many
different passions and try to figure out
how to make them all work I recently
spoke with a female who is
engineer and she also Oberon's an
Instagram page that is based towards
makeup and she would tell me of you know
once her co-workers found out about her
makeup page all of the crap that she got
for it because you know she's this super
smart educated talented engineer why
would she be in to make up to and you
know kind of demeaning her because for
some reason when we say that we work in
makeup or beauty for some reason that
has the sigma of all of a sudden we
can't be smart women and we can't be
successful and it's been really
encouraging I think to see on youtube
and see where some of these youtubers
and influences are going that we're
changing that stigma and I think that is
really important and really really
amazing so I have talked to a lot of
people who work in a lot of different
areas of life and then do this because
this is a passion of theirs and
something that I really want to pursue
and how hard it is to get people to
understand that we don't have to just be
one person we don't have to only be
defined by one thing and I think that's
been really special so that's kind of
the message that I've wanted to bring to
this video if you have felt different in
your life and you felt like no one else
understands you I encourage you to
really look around get on social media
and find whatever it is that you have a
passion for because I can almost promise
you that you will find other like-minded
people out there and it will change your
world honestly no the negativity will be
there I I mean I feel like in no matter
what area it is that you do negativity
will be there push bag is going to be
there thinking about that negative
comment over and over and over and I
would forget about all these other
positive comments that had come in those
are the comments that you need to focus
on that's the feedback that you need to
focus your energy into because you can't
let the negativity do it for you or else
it'll take you on a path that is not
good because trust me I went down it
several times I said to my husband it
was maybe like two months ago I said to
him I said I finally feel like I'm doing
everything that I wanted to do I'm
finally doing everything that I wanted
to do when I set out to do it in 2009 it
took me this long to figure it out it
took me
song to get the confidence and you know
what it might have taken me a while but
at least I found it at least I found it
and I'm not going to continue to go down
that path of letting others kind of
dictate me or rule hella will make my
decisions and that's been a really
really empowering feeling so that's just
the message that I want to spread around
to others so those are kind of the real
reasons why I decided to start YouTube
again and again and then relaunch again
so many of these other real talk videos
like no matter what subject are on
they're very motivating to me as well so
I wanted to kind of do my part in that
because those are videos that have meant
so much to me and really inspired me
that I want it to be able to make my own
video I just hope that you guys have
found this video helpful in some ways or
encouraging in some ways the thing is
more disheartening to me that when I see
other people get asked why they want it
to be on YouTube and it's because they
want to be famous or because they want
free makeup or things like that like
they're missing the point if that's why
you're getting on youtube or if that's
why you're doing anything that you want
to be doing I truly think that you're
missing the point and you're missing the
bigger picture that is out there I was
really glad that I was able to hop on
here and let you guys know kind of what
it meant to me how it has changed me and
also just kind of give you guys an
update of you know the relaunch on my
channel never really talked about it
specifically you know I kind of changed
everything around from like my banner
used to say like Chiclets plus and have
the books on there and I've changed all
that Iran's reflect more of what this
channel is going to be and never really
addressed it on here and then I came out
with the redesign on chocolate plus and
I did write an article on to clipless
kind of about it and kind of what I
spoke about as well so I can leave that
link down in the description box too but
i hope you will leave in the comments
you know if you're on social media if
you're on YouTube leave in the comments
down below like maybe why you started or
like what are some of the greatest
things that I'm being on social media
and YouTube or Instagram or whatever it
is because I love hearing other people's
stories as well I just think it's really
inspiring and definitely motivating to
keep on going YouTube is a ton of work
being on social media is a ton of work
because especially
when it's essentially you know one of
your full-time jobs is you never feel
like you are done working you know
people can come home from their regular
job and unwind and you know not think
about that again until they go in the
next day but when you are in an industry
like this you never feel like you get a
