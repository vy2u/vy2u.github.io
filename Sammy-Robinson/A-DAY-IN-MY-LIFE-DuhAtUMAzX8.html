on a Monday morning and I thought I'd
get my vlogging camera out and start a
brand new vlog today's going to be
pretty boring activism I'm not getting
up to too much I've got to go to two
different post office to get two
different packages because I'm expecting
packages from princess Polly and from
Maybelline and then I'm probably just
going to go get a green juice and a
coffee
I've already had my porridge this
morning I keep not filming my breakfast
because I'm going to be doing a morning
routine soon so that'll my recipe for
what I eat morning will be in that then
have to fill in two videos today so I've
got one for a sports girl because I'm
doing a video with them and then I've
got to film another Maybelline video for
their channel I'm going to be filming
heat and heaps of Maybelline so got like
double the workloads that I love it how
to show you guys my outfit before I run
out at all today's outfit I am wearing a
top a flurry sleeved top jumper thing
from as a prom at Moss and here this
scarf is Burberry glasses I literally
are good I keep meaning to tell you guys
sorry outfit shot information I get so
many questions from you guys why is this
sooo blur and don't know what brand
needs are because I see all your
questions asking but I actually just
don't know so as you can see it says
Canada like that retro collection by
spectacle I work in so many Google
spectacle I works in care of jeans that
I'm pretty sure I cut holes in ages ago
and I don't know where they're from but
if I can find some I'll link them down
below similar and then I've got my
German Chi slides on I'm casual outfit
but I've accessorized it would designer
it looks like I'm fully dressed up but I
actually look like a hobo so take my
Gucci bag as always please it means so
much to me that you guys liked my little
positivity talk and in my last vlog I'm
going to show you guys what I get home
I've been reading heaps and heaps of
books when I hate and heaps the hell
that especially exaggeration I've been
reading a book and it's about thriving
and being positive and how important it
is to live your life how you want to
live it
okay welcome to the first up is number
one now
thank you okay so I've got my green
juice this had this green juice has kale
spinach lemon ginger chia seeds coconut
water and an apple and they also got
myself a kombucha for later this one has
lemon and lime and ginger in it I've
been around so many people that are so
sick including Nick he was so sick last
week and still is quite sick but where
my vitamins when my own mega three my
probiotics they kissing me goodbye
keeping me going so yummy this is from
fresh blind obviously both of these are
from fresh blend I haven't really shown
you guys all the vitamins and stuff that
I've been taking because it's
all-natural all-natural ingredients so
it's not like anything red-hot I'm not
going to recommend you guys get them if
I don't I'm obviously not qualified and
I don't know what you guys need so I
don't want you guys to start taking
stuff just because I am but it a mega
tree is obviously really good for your
brain your mental health your
concentration
it has heaps of other great effects fish
oil is just really good for your body
that's omega-3 is we have no idea what
I'm talking about
I've been watching a lot of health
videos lately and what's good to take
and what's not for example there are
enzymes out there that are really good
for your digestion and help you digest
food really easily but for me I don't
know if I should be taking enzymes for
my body so I know that papaya is really
good for you
and that's obviously a natural source of
vitamins because it comes from the fruit
cardio nose heaps about this when I went
to the house one day and she was taking
you know sort of papaya and antioxidants
and stuff and she was telling me that it
was all really good for you so I looked
hit into it and I've been watching heat
of people's opinions on it mm-hmm that
guys watching me so as long as you guys
are eating your greens eating your
veggies stuff me up on lots of healthy
natural foods you'll be good I'm going
to slowly start introducing lots more
health and fitness on my channel as I
learn because I'm still learning I have
no idea what I'm talking about but
more educated myself more I'll try and
educate you guys as long as I know that
it is legitimate anyway I'm going to
drive home now
open these packages show you guys and I
feel like this is going to be another
daily vlog because I've been talking so
much I'm in the best mood I'm so lucky
that vlogging is my job and love filming
I love editing I love my job and it's
all because of you guys so thank you
desperately need to get my car cleaned
I've got cobwebs all over it I love this
car but black shows everything this is
my princess Holly otter but I'm not
going to show you guys this because I'm
going to be doing a haul on that Oh stay
tuned for that and Justin on the ground
now but I thought I would just show you
guys what I got from scripts I got some
little veggie chips like beetroot carrot
beans so I like chia seeds because my
one one out of date and I don't know if
it's obviously it's not good to eat
anything that's out of date but I don't
know if it's like very detrimental so
nutrient foods which I'll just put in a
little jar probably I got these
chocolate so these are macadamia nuts
macadamia nuts dipped in honey it's milk
chocolate and then dipped in a white
chocolate
oh my god hmm
myself a feedbag at full of dark
chocolate goji berries so I'm just
dark chocolate coated goji berries so
last I got a big bag of steel-cut oats
and then I got a big bag of rolled oats
because I've been making heaps of
porridge lately and I'm about to run out
so this one is - organic and not from a
packet and there's no preservatives and
stuff in it so I'll probably bet just
put that in a jar as well oh okay now
I'm going to show you guys my book so I
have another one but I don't know where
I've put it so mum got me from KDK this
little quote book which is called life
is for living words to inspire so it's
basically just full of lots of little
quotes like I'll open up on a random
page and it says start each day with a
grateful heart there is always something
to be thankful for so I don't know
reading these just make me go okay I can
feel them in the in the worst mood or
really unmotivated and I read that my
mind yeah what the hell is wrong with me
like there's always something to be
thankful for but this will certainly be
friend so this is the book I'm reading
Arianna Huffington has called thrive and
that she did The Huffington Post The
Huffington Post or whatever that thing
online is and I'm having to post yet I'm
not actually sure what it is I don't
really read ethically redefining what
success is so - a lot of people's
successes money and power status and all
things related to that but that is not
what success should be and she's sort of
saying we should redefine success and
make sort of a third spectrum to success
and make sure that that is how we feel
how we're how happy we are the people
around us and be appreciative for the
small things in life and make sure that
we're taking care of ourselves you know
the things in your life such as family
friends love that's the stuff that
really means the most not your house
your car and how much money you have so
if you guys are willing to feel inspired
definitely get this
I need to find a storage compartment all
my vitamins and proteins and stuff
because it's just covering my bed I put
a scale how are you you can sleep in my
bed please make my bed Bobby sorry
building what is your knot on my sheets
I cleaned my room yesterday and look at
the mess of already made it's just
constant it's just constantly busy I
just can't stay on top of it oh this top
is prom princess Polly by the way i just
opened all the stuff that i'm going to
do for my haul oh just be careful man
loving cell phone fell between oh yeah
today I have way too much stuff in this
closet
and usually a clean-out really badly but
I feel like I really want to move into
my own apartment so that's like the
reason I'm not clearing stuff out
because I'm like well I'll just wait
till I get my own place and then I can
just do a massive decluttering video and
clear everything that I don't need in my
life out but I just don't think I can
wait for that she likes to live in the
closet thank you baby

the kitchen a bit of a clean it's just
down to put it that makes me feel better
um now onto this so which is all my
stuff

that rubbish is from the one package so
I've got to put that in my skip outside

that's here is the hair

an adult and 4 mils get my read pay my
registration bills um put the Reggio in
my car and then I can edit this log
