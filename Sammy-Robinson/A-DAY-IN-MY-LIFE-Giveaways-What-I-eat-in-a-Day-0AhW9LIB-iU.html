like four videos going on at the moment
and I'm getting in here which ones which
I just filmed this look on Maybelline's
youtube channel it's like a nice upon
the bronzer all kinds I'll be on mobile
YouTube channel and I'm filming my
nighttime routine tonight I'm still
editing a video for Maybelline flips
watches and I've just uploaded a video
on my channel which was a get ready with
me so feel like I'm like what is this
vlog I don't even know what it's going
to be about but I've got quite a few
things to do today and over the next few
days so I sort of bring you guys along
so I'm keen for today and I hope you
guys are too first things first I'm just
going to import all my footage into my
computer that I just filmed from
Maybelline just make sure all the
footage is good so that when I do go to
edit it and do my voice over I'm not
working with complete rubbish then I'm
gonna be heading to Priceline I need to
buy some school accessories I run out of
toothpaste I need a new toothbrush I
need some shaving stuff and then I'm
going to go to the grocery store and buy
some groceries for tonight because I'm
going to do a bit of a what I usually
eat at night and I've run out of
everything at my house for my nighttime
routine obviously because I have a have
dinner
it's brightening the morning it's about
9:00 a.m. so I thought I would show you
guys everything that I sort of ate just
in a really casual vlog and just sort of
everything I get up to today and I also
have Pilates at 5:00 tonight and I
desperately need a coffee yesterday is
the first day that I haven't had a
coffee in a really long time and it was
weird like I was exhausted so I fully
thinks that I'm addicted to coffee now I
was just not good but I'm gonna get a
coffee just so they don't get tired
today and I can complete all don't mind
the mess I'm just constantly messy what
do you guys expect
first things first I like to make myself
a hot lemon water in the morning and
then have a health shot so you guys know
that I make my own health spots with all
my tumeric and some things over there
recently I've just been using this
because I bought this from the market at
Palm Beach it's doctor tears too much
elixir which is wrong cold-pressed whole
tumor group just makes really easy exact
or listen to a shot knife to make my own
ingredient in it tumeric ginger honey
cinnamon and black pepper which are all
really really good for you so I have
this size I also add a little bit of my
cleanse powder into it just because I'm
doing a hell show it doesn't taste that
good anyway so may as well add some
greens into my sink and alkalizing super
greens and probiotics and everything
others really good to your skin and
literally just pour that into a shot
glass like the shots I don't like
tequila out of priorities doesn't taste
too bad but it's not the greatest
bottoms up
so I sleep so much much everywhere I go
I'm the message that's annual ever made
in the first hour well now I'm going to
go down to my lemon cherry pick a lemon
and make myself a hot lemon water it is
literally the best thing having lemon
tree who needs a chopping board snuggly
as I got my white fox hole delivered
stay tuned for a whole totally kidding
this is the new Shen XO x wipes akatsuki
stuff I had no idea to align with them I
ordered a car mount and let's find
Mountain stuff for my party of the day
from Amazon whatnot the other day
actually I'm going to go I also order
their new big tripod so I can do a
little bit more filming like the
nighttime routine stuff
I need tripods and skincare routine I
need tripods but I don't have any so I'm
just going to find my places to launch
my camera so that'll be exciting but
hopefully soon the thing will have
arrived and it will work because last
time I ordered it it didn't even hold
the camera who broke in pieces like
straight away that I am looking forward
to because if I can do card logs it just
means that I can talk to you guys more
not have to worry about it it's salts
lying all over the dashboard and stuff
I'm just because
five right now I'm off to go to Python
I'm going to go get myself some razors
and all the essentials but I'm going to
just just do a few jobs on out I really
need to get the bank actually got me
he's going the bank and set up an
account that's got my documents our idea
and pretty much doesn't get a coffee as
well so my engine so it's only 10:00
a.m. so I'll get my cup of coffee in a
no go home because I'm only out for like
half an hour right now so when I go home
I will make myself peanut butter
my addiction right now has been P about
a toast with banana on top this one will
Henry's money it's so much yesterday
that just wasn't hungry yeah you're like
talking about health and stuff on my
channel is something I definitely
obviously want to include in the world
but it's very risky to do so because
everyone has very strong opinions and
everyone seems to think they're right
about how they do it and I don't ever
count calories I could not care less
about calories the only reason I know
that is because when I started with my
trainer he made me love my food in any
calorie counting thing just so that
purely just so that he could see what I
was eating not losing calories and just
because of that I saw how many calories
I was eating in a day and pretty much
every day it was average around 2,300 or
more calories and like that's still like
that's still not that much for me I'm a
very tall girl I definitely wouldn't say
I'm active every day but I try to be
active four times a week
and so I've got to eat a lot and so I
don't want you guys trying to copy me
and I'm not educated I don't really
don't know what I'm talking about so I
don't want to be suggesting things I
just want to suggest a healthy lifestyle
and that's all I can try to do but I
just don't you guys taking things the
wrong way you know so yeah
I've been loving the champagne lately
amazing
I know what is some reasonably good
I always do that before I go into my
science thinking - I see things walk out
was like coal shop size but because it's
kind of like a little bit nostalgic for
me the whole YouTube started off just me
by myself drugstore makeup I could never
afford the high-end expensive stuff in
mum where who wouldn't buy it for me or
she'd buy it for me very rarely I used
to get my paychecks from fresh loans or
the pulp and I got my phone Daisy can
vouch for me she would come with me and
I would spend all of my money at
Priceline all on new makeup and she was
like what is wrong with you
so funny I so because I went in there
and the girl was like I recognize you
from somewhere and I was like I always
had to walk to be like I have a YouTube
channel so I was like maybe you can come
gigi hadid other Moke to suit low people
say that it she was like no I recognize
you from an ad and I was like oh
probably the snapchat to snapchat
maybelline one huh as much I was so
 I love Mabley like all my heart
but I just look at those videos I cannot
help but cringe myself you love me
just made my stock into fresh blend and
got myself a green smoothie and a
kombucha oscillator and then I also got
myself my coffee and then a bread roll
let's go home and get some editing zone
and plan out my nighttime routine I
don't know how to make that cool on that
last night without just being boring you
know me I got my skincare in it might
cook some dinner but then I don't know
what else to put in it you know so I'm
going to go to plan out okay so I'm
currently doing one of my giveaways
