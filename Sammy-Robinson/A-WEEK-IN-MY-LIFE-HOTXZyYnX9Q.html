clothes I've so many jumpers that
obviously that looks gonna look messy
cleaned out a lot of my tops these are
all my jackets now my dress is Nick
stuff and these are the sort of my
jumpsuits and sure so I've cleared it
all out and it's looking a lot more put
together as both obviously you guys saw
my last blog that I've cleaned up these
areas here obviously it looks very
cluttered because it's a small room with
lots of stuff in it but as you guys
might remember I had this whole section
over here was my makeup section so I've
finally cleared all of that and got it
all looking like a dining room again I
think I like this filming area a lot
better with this in the background and
that coming with the light the light
coming through hello so the last thing I
have to do is make up this stand for
glasses so this is like sort of one of
those glasses cans you find in stores
and I'm just going to stack all my
glasses up and put it on the centerpiece
here just next to my bags just because
I've got so many glasses and they had
that are just lying around so yes
feeling very accomplished the door Bambi

stand I'm just like testing out my
lighting and this is my vlogging camera

just wake up and say hello I look
absolutely tragic I've woken up with
this big bite on my face I've got the
bags under my eyes but anyway I thought
I would just say good morning to right

I don't forget because I get so many
questions and I am wearing the
colour-pop ultra matte lip in B pop to
like a little tiny one I think I have
like a test of maybe and then on the
center I'm wearing color pops Libby
stick in cookie and the fragrance I'm
wearing today is by coach so it's nice
light fragrance Polly's having a
get-together today this afternoon my
favorite thing to do in summer is just
to go around to the friends house and
have barbecues and drinks in the
afternoon
so yeah I'm off to Holly's now what was
she invited even with that peaceful I'm
not canonic was making it make the room
a bit more pretty a bit more attractive
Oh
oh my god that was really autistic I'm
proud of bonds blaring yes really like
real fancy I really mind the voice to
marry only what I - I'm just so
I'm aware that I look like The Tin Man
I've just put on my glam glow face mask
today I haven't really been doing
anything to be honest I've just been
doing a lot of work and emails and
editing um so it wasn't anything
interesting to show you guys but I
needed to have a shower you know when
you have those long days on the computer
and you feel so gross and stuffy just
constantly looking at a screen so you
have a shower and give myself a face
mask just to refresh myself yeah I
thought I'd just check in today I
haven't haven't spoken to you guys all
day um this this face mask is great for
firming so tightens your skin really
nicely it makes it super super soft
takes up all the dead skin because it's
one of those pili masks um so yeah I
love it but anyway just so it's a hello
good morning guys I know you probably
hear the drilling in the background so
I'm not going to talk for long but Abbi
I'm crazy so I just got sent this cute
little package and I have no idea what
it is oh it's from Shaunie cute ah she
sent waters isn't that lovely she's just
come out with her own little watch brand
so that's adorable she's given me black
white and beige cute packaging hey jaded
I'm sitting here ready to fill my
favorites video I've got all my items
laid out here and the people in the
background I'm mowing a lawn
there's someone drilling something
there's someone walking past doing like
something with their lawn I might just
stick some eyelashes on just have fun
while I'm waiting I just custom created
the most hectic eyelashes just got
another delivery from fresh beautiful
packaging gosh it is disgustingly hot
today it's 35 degrees well I am NOT
going outside again after today I'm
literally melting it's one of those days
that it's so hot so that you feel like
you should be at the beach but it's like
almost too hot to even be at the beach
so you use me like inside in aircon
I'm melting I don't know 35 degrees for
me it's pretty hot wish I could be at
the beach but too much way to do so yes
I'm going to the shops now to get myself
another memory card because obviously
I'm vlogging all the time on this camera
now and my other memory card is broken
so I need to get one for my filming
camera um and then I would probably get
nice coffee or something because it's
really hot and I want a coffee make it
home the people that were mowing the
lawn and drilling holes wherever they
were will be done and I can fill my
favorites video because I need to film
that before I sweat this makeup off I
don't like wearing makeup that often in
someone like I truly truly hate the
feeling of them of it on my skin
success they didn't have any big ones so
I just got to two little small ones get
me out of this heat wave
I am done I just turned right did you
