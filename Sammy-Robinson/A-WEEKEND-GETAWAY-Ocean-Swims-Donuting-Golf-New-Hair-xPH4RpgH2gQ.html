myself
can you believe it so I went to the
hairdresser's and I got a cut so it was
like down here sort of in those end bits
we're getting super like scruffy and way
too blond I wasn't liking how blond it
was so I went and cut it off and now
it's like a nice honey shade all over
this is pretty much now my natural hair
color cuz the last time I dyed it was
brown and obviously if you guys have
been following me for a while you know
that it used to be bleach blonde so I'm
from bleach bleach blonde too Brown died
at Brown again a few times toned it a
few times and then this summer it's just
kind of gone back to its natural color
which is like a honey blonde but I got
it cut I put a treatment in it as well
so it just feels super healthy and
really nice oh it's now Sunday I
actually have so much footage to show
you guys from the weekend when Mum was
really cute but I went out to pommy for
the weekend with my family and I wasn't
actually intending to vlog it at all my
mum kept being like give me the camera
or actually I didn't have the camera
give me a find give me a phone and she
wanted to capture a lot of footage for
me which was high cuz she's always
saying to me she's like I want you I
want you to mix up your vlog so getting
boring and of course my mom like knows
and I thought I do every day so she
watches in Josiah you're repetitive and
I can say that like I can see how it
gets repetitive yeah so she was like you
know I'll start filming some stuff for
you and we'll make it more interesting
you should do fun things together which
is really nice um I've been thinking it
for a while now about hiring a
videographer but I even if I had mum
come around and film stuff for me that
would be kinda cool as well I think oh
yes so so yeah she filmed a whole bunch
of stuff that we got up to while we were
in Tommy and um I didn't really talk it
at all so I'll probably just find some
cool music and just put a few clips in
for you guys now so enjoy
I've been
yes
now you swinging better
it's two people
yep
okay
that's how to play golf
weekends
I've been doing
till the ocean comes don't push me cause
I'm close to the edge
stand by to your shrinkage don't let me
see
are you okay yeah I'm fine
been tryna get out oh we have a doctor -
but that's alright
I was wondering if you wanna do go for a
truck
I just need some fresh air and an old
friend I'm so good that we started
talking again he'll turn up the radio I
love that song remember when we used to
stay up all night long as I've been
going over the house and mom the winter
so I'm feeling sore so damn proud we
stick on the highway we can drive all
night
we round to the sky and see me it was
fine
see
no Billy ovaries the thumbs up if you
guys think my mom's a good videographer
she's so cute she's such a classic mum
capturing all like the really random
stuff that I would never think to
capture but bless her I love her so much
how come obviously I've done a bit of a
cleanup this is Nick's last day off
today so we're gonna go for a nice
dinner tonight our favorite restaurant
and have some heat so I'm gonna make
myself a tea now and save as well like
could I possibly get any Tokyo or
glamour in the hair then like absolutely
this so annoying kiss my Garland and
like the daggers human have it on Bombur
I just love having healthy hair feels so
good just making myself a detox tea I
sought Lydia talking about it Lydia
Elise millon I love her
I've only met her briefly but she's
absolutely actually lovely and she's so
freaking stunning it's like ridiculous
I have loves and I saw her make a tea
with apple cider vinegar lemon and
lemongrass and ginger that makes with
like lemon and honey is also tasty and I
always have lemon and ginger teas with a
lemon in it or like honey in it but I've
never mixed it all together so I just
used the lemon and ginger lemongrass and
ginger from t2 and I just said store it
in my little bitty - box - box
oh by the way how funny is this we went
donating on the weekend which you guys
would have seen and if my nails were so
long like you guys probably saw how long
my nails were before we went and it kept
getting scared that they were gonna
break holding on to the thing so I got
back onto the boat and I just cut them
off and they're all like jaggedy and
crazy because I kind of bit slash cut
them soup into lighting incense I got
this incense and you just take like one
of them these little things and you just
light it and I just like leave it in
this cup it's just like super nice
because it like it makes my room smell
really nice
one thing I will say though about
drinking these days is that you need to
be super couple of your tape cuz there's
so much acid in the UM or acidity in the
lemon and in the apple cider vinegar um
I don't know what it is that you have to
do I think it I think it's don't brush
your taste straight away maybe wait a
little bit and then you brush your teeth
just to protect the enamels of your
teeth but don't quote me on it I don't
know what you're supposed to do but just
to make sure that either you can drink
it through a straw which is kinda shitty
or um like white like ten minutes or
half an hour or something and then brush
your teeth so that it doesn't roll your
safe tastes so good though and it's
really good for your digestion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
