back in Sydney I am pretty damn sick and
we'll get into I'll have a big talk with
you guys but I wanted to put a little
bit of makeup on and when I have nothing
else to do in the day because it's
Sunday it's it's Sunday today so I'm
just chillin I always get really carried
away and start packing makeup on my face
so obviously you guys know that I get to
practice all the time and I haven't been
back into a Maximas yet to pick up the
packages that I received while I was
away
but I just got this one if dying I did a
little bit of remember unboxing with you
guys I am so grateful to crystal night
for sending all of this to me there's no
way of making me presentable you guys
know I'm messy I'm so into jewelry right
now like I'm obsessed with jewelry you
guys can probably tell they've started
wearing lots of earrings and rings and
necklaces and stuff so oh my gosh I've
already kind of opened it and like a
little look I just wanna talk on camera
with you guys I'm just gonna start like
doing a little whole style video of all
this jewelry just because it's so
beautiful and I'll list it down below if
you guys want to in order of the things
that I mentioning as always because I
know that you guys who love it and be
interested I'll try and make sure I
listed in the order as I say it crystal
net jewelry is all handcrafted with so
much love and integrity and our crystal
jewels are delicate it's a first up I've
got this beautiful ring I chose this one
because I just wanted one that was
really simple and just with like a
really small crystal on it yes it fits
on my middle finger how gorgeous is that
dying a little bit in fact Oh guys this
is just so beautiful she gave me so much
as well I'm so grateful it feels like
the most beautiful quality next time I
got this little pendant that's a little
bracelet so I'm going to put that on
that is what that looks like
the gorgeous little bracelet I'm gonna
love how it's all matchy-matchy now as
well next up I tried I got so much
similar stuff and I just loved all the
delicate stuff next up I got this
necklace just a really simple necklace
to go with bracelet and it's really cute
just at the clasp it has one that goes
down the back as well that crystal
become I just put my hair up that is
what this one looks like it's so
beautiful
now that I'm going to be wearing all
these crystals I need to look more into
what they do because I know that these
crystals have healing powers apparently
so
each crystal does like an individual
thing there's like the love crystal and
the healing crystal and these ones I
just looked up and they are the clear
quartz which means they're the master
healers so these ones specifically all
of the clear ones that I've got have
healing properties which is fabulous I
need that in my life I know every piece
of jewelry that you buy from them is
individual and specific to you and it's
like a really unique piece of jewelry so
it's not like manufactured along with a
lot of other ones they like individually
make these and so yours once you buy it
it's yours and it's like specialty units
unique to you so that makes the crystal
more special I think and I know that all
the pieces are sterling silver so 925
sterling silver and some of them are
twelve karat gold-plated or 25 or 24
karat gold rose gold plated I decided to
go gold and then this one's rose gold
just cuz I wanted to mix it up I have a
lot of jewelry that is just different
color so I wanted to make sure that I
had a bit of rose gold a bit of gold
next up I got these awesome earrings so
it's like a hoop with the chain and the
crystal hanging through the center I'm
gonna put these on as well how cool it
these men they are so cool
oh my god
new favorite earrings I think so
I all of that so different all right I'm
just gonna take that that's annoying me
I really should have presented my
background for you guys it's kind of
keyed up next up we got another necklace
I just wanted to do the layered look
love love the layered look and this one
is a little bit bigger so this crystal
is a lot larger than those ones but I
got the oh my god this one's cool
this one's thicker ring oh that is sick
look at that that is like a giant
crystal
that is so freakin cool hey of that I
never really wear big rings so can you
hear that kids screaming in the
background of my next-door neighbors
grandchildren will come swimming in the
pool very loud whoa oh my god stop haha
look at those earrings so they've got
one hoop with another bigger hoop and
then a smaller hoop again the inside of
that well these are cool I'm going to
see how these look at my seconds oh
that's so cool oh my god it's probably a
bit hectic on me but I love that oh my
god I'm gonna be siblings out okay oh
yeah the double hope and except in this
case it's like the triple quadruple hook
oh this ring is cool so then I got
another ring and this one instead kind
of dangles so actually I got two like
that Wow oh my god she's too kind I put
them on the same fingers like that
hey guys I'm just gonna butt in here for
a little second as I was wearing those
rings during the day there were a little
bit big for my finger and I was a little
bit confused that's why I had to and I
was trying to figure it out and I was
playing around with them and then I
realized they are in fact earrings so I
got earrings so you can see they're just
here these ones which have actually
turned out to be like some of my
favorite pieces of the range showing you
guys this but that's the ones just on
the outside here definitely not made of
your fingers there definitely make your
ears anyways enjoy the rest of the with
you and then what else is big see you
guys I'm not joking I got so much stuff
I can't believe it
oh and then I got a little choked up
there you can see how that all looks
stacked they love chokers so I'm really
happy that I got choker
and I probably most likely I mean I
would say that I probably wouldn't wear
this all together
but at the same time I'm kind of digging
it like I really like it and then I got
another little ring like this those are
the different styles that we've got
going there's the one that goes down the
one that goes across the one that
dangles oh wow and then she gave me an
actual crystal Wow
I need to look into this crystal and
like know what to do with it like where
to put it
I'm just taking the hair out now my hair
said I could show you guys better and
then finally I've got these little
earrings as well and these are a little
bit more simple I knew I would regret
doing this makeup why I hate dark makeup
all of the jewelry necklaces and
earrings I feel like a million dollars
thank you so much to Crystal night and
her team for sending these over to me
I'm so grateful like so grateful I'm
gonna be wearing these all the time it's
definitely my new favorite jewelry has
amazing I know that she hand-picked
every crystal individually it's all hand
crafted it's all amazing she donates $1
to a life-changing project every time
that you buy something so she's
beautiful and charitable as well they're
just amazing
I actually get over how beautiful it is
so I'm so grateful thank you so much
sending it over to me thank you so much
thank you so much pasta this Sunday and
I'm just chilling I just wanted to talk
to you guys and I can tell you guys a
little bit about my trip so I just
wanted to give you guys a little rundown
on my trip because I told you that I
would possibly vlog in LA and I just
decided not to because Mecca land was
amazing I had such noise and timing that
so many of you guys if you saw my last
video I did I filmed a bit of behind the
scenes you can go watch that if you want
to otherwise I wasn't sure whether I
would vlog when I go to LA and once I
was there I was like hell no because I
basically woke up got on my flight
landed drove three hours to Palm Springs
got to Palm Springs
and I got a spray tan done because I had
a photo shoot the next morning and I was
staying with Holly and a bunch of the
Mexican actors girls because a bunch of
the max connecters girls was I were on
like the Coachella tour and Lauren
Curtis was quite sick so she actually
came into the room after I had just
returned and she was like would you like
my ticket like do you want to go in and
as well just side note I didn't sleep on
the plane you know whenever I fly to LA
and the flight is at like 10:00 a.m. in
the morning I know I'm so aware that
it's all day and that it's day time for
me that I just can't sleep so I just
stay up and watch movies the whole time
I got there I was exhausted hadn't slept
it was exhausted from Mecca land and I
was like ready to get into bed watch
suits all night and just relax and so
Lauren really threw a spanner in the
works and of course I was gonna say yes
because hello Coachella already I'd like
20 minutes chucked a bunch of Holly's
clothes on and we went in for the day
I got to see Beyonce it was the best
time I felt like I was running off I was
just running off adrenaline I was
exhausted but I actually had the best
time like I didn't feel tired once I was
there had a few cocktails and then
anyway we got back that night I went to
sleep at like 2:00 a.m. I had to wake up
the next morning and had my exciting
photoshoot which went really well and
I'm really excited to be able to tell
you guys about that soon and then once
the photoshoot was done I literally
crashed and died and burned I was so I
was sick so was that on my screen and
then I started to feel like I got a
little bit better but as I flew home I
again crashed and burned and so I got
home yesterday minded like 7:00 a.m. I
had a meeting at 9 a.m. I went to the
meeting feeling so write down and so
tired but I'm trying to keep myself
awake and just push through because I
don't want this week to be spent sick in
bed like I can't stand being sick I hate
it I just want to get better I've loaded
up on all my vitamins and stuff that
I've also been eating so so badly
because somebody brought me a you know
jet lag relief pack and it's got like
shapes and chocolate
red frogs and lots of blocks of
chocolate and lollies and everything
that he noticed that I love and so I've
just been feeling sorry for myself
eating all of that which wouldn't be
making me feel any better
I need like kale smoothies and like
hydrate myself not eat sugar and salt
but hey guys to be honest at this point
I'm sorry I'm down though I'm just like
and I'm just gonna sing better than a
chocolate that is where I'm at in
regards to my personal life I feel like
there's of what I have to tell you guys
but I don't really know like where to
begin or what to say
I don't really feel ready to talk about
it I don't really know how to explain
this what I open up to you guys but I
only open up to you guys to a certain
extent because I'm sure you can imagine
whipping out a camera you're literally
sitting alone and you're talking to a
camera and you're not getting that
interaction back and I'm not bouncing
off anyone so I struggle to talk about
things and give my opinions on things
and open up about the way that I feel
like I do it with my friends of my
family and that's the only people that I
do it with and I've got a very
close-knit group of friends and a very
close family so I don't do it
myself okay
in saying that I don't lie about
anything and I'm not hiding anything
from you guys I'm exactly the way that I
am in real life with you guys but I just
don't like to get too deep into things
and yet I don't really know what is
going on in my personal life things
change and yeah I don't really know it's
funny how many people want to speculate
and spread rumors about stuff that is
going on I find it so funny some of the
stuff that I've had uh I know the people
that are spreading it as well and it's
just like so cringe worthy to me that
people want to spend part of their day
talking about me and I get it I'm
putting myself on line for people to
talk about that I think that they people
spreading rumors and talking garbage
about me and my relationships and none
of it is true and I can tell you know
that it's true there are some hectic
rumors out there if you guys hear them
they're not true don't worry about it I
am all good though I actually planned on
doing like a daily vlog but I feel like
I've been talking to you guys for like
20 minutes straight so I don't know I
don't really want to make this video too
long for you guys yeah maybe I feel like
the second this was just a little life
update slash jewelry jewelry haul which
I'm dying over
I feel so you did it I'll show you guys
my cock will show you guys a little gel
like really fuck watch I got two pairs
of sheets already finished one please

struggles to drink plain water is it so
bad but I have to drink cordial with it
