horrendous and Sydney coming from the

Manly and then on Sunday we went to
ordinary wolf and had lunch with his
family so it was a very big weekend
hi Sophie idle physical able to whoo-hoo
to not see me so these are some of the
goodies that we picked up from the
showcase of these looks so exciting have
to spray something on them so they look
really dirty but it's the new Naz
bronzers they're basically Mac versions
of the Laguna and the casino bronzer
this brand I'd never really heard of
shang-chi and it has the nicest concept
you buy things and they donate a lot of
the money to proceed so it's all natural
ingredients I'm excited to try that
brand from by Terry so they've got their
new sort of summer and spring editions
that's my favorite thing ever I've
showed you guys before the Cheetahs
hands face mist it's the small version
to love these out guys and get powders
they're beautiful
and we also got some urban decay dove
make made new shades of this naked flush
palette got some eye shadows and they've
come out with new little lipstick so I'm
so glad we got this shade called 1983 so
this benefit delivery has just arrived
and I'm assuming it's for Wednesday yep
we're going to Justin Bieber with
benefit on Wednesday I'm so excited
I mean Tess's one-month lonely girl J we
had some of the eyebrow products my
favorite eyebrow products the moment is
- precisely my brow pencil I've been
lately and something Brown and highbrow
I'm going to make myself some lunch
I'm going to show you guys what I've
been loving at the moment it's so so
random but do not judge me I like
putting couscous with falafel and then
putting Thai green curry sauce on it and
then just cutting heaps of veggies just
okay
I do quite a bit second
I've already had a ricotta today so in
Thai green curry sauce
I like onion onion makes everything
better so I know you can't see but the
couscous is underneath that's the
falafel and capsicum and I just heated
up the store with the rest of the
falafel so I add in this sauce making a
mess and then I'm going to add the onion
the lesser look at some avocado in salt
and pepper and that is it mom's glasses
on oh well I cannot see anything got
ourselves some miso soup and some sushi
train we're going to watch we haven't
watched a TV series and ages and so
we're thinking of starting there what's
it called Oh Jay Simpson
it's that food that is the OJ Simpson
this is mixed by the way did you have a
motive
life of OJ lack of OJ awesome hey
Michael
freshly squeezed Oh Jay Oh take your bet

been in a bit of a rush I've only just
got out of the uber and arrived at
cardio's place we are going to Justin
Bieber tonight which is so exciting yes
I've never really been the very kind of
just the neighbor until recently I like
the circus I love all the 15 songs and
have for like a little while so I'm
really really excited and we're going
with benefit so a whole bunch would be
blood will be going and it should be
really really fun life first if I'm
coming to cut is I'm really buddy we've
got the record player and the plant oh
I'm at cardio's now and we just ordered
our over so it's going to come pick us

you know what time they say we're
leaving six I don't know but we're
meeting at the benefit head office all
together and then we're going to go in
ah
you
Oh
why
Demi
hello guys so this morning I just set up
all mums that I Paulo cute pink myself
but set up a few makeup workstations
because mom's having her best friend
over and I mean this sort of teach them
how to do makeup they definitely would
not wear as much makeup as I do that's
I'm sure but we thought it would be
funny if I sort of did every single step
possible to baking cream contouring
cream blush blush like everything so
yeah that's what's happening this
morning I'll show you guys the setup
it's really cute tried to set it up all
in order for them we've got like primers
and they should concealer cream runs of
normal bronzers translucent powders
baking normal purposes I shadows
highlighters setting spray
this is where they'll be sitting
drinking their champagne
that's my little station too funny
anyway and then tonight we're going off
to Palm Beach so me and the girls and
then I think Nick and Harris in a
comment to Palm Beach just to get
settled and have some pizza and drink
and because party in the park is
tomorrow so yeah it's good to go out the
night before too scared and ready settle
in and then but in five shots during the
day so it'll be good to be up there yeah
it should be a good weekend I loved
planning a past life here and that's
actually where I met Nick
I met Nick at the same time last year so
yeah so there's like the one-year
anniversary when like everything started
so that's perfect - I'm just telling
them about how many a Nick met at Hyde
Park well we didn't meet up out of
pocket where it all began so yeah I've
made myself a hot chocky it's so funny
so as you guys will have seen in this
vlog I went to Justin Bieber so Justin
Bieber is in Sydney at the moment but
it's funny because he's been going to
all the places that I like my favorite
things ever so here's one of that fresh
blend he was spotted at sugars and I
keep getting comments from you guys
being like oh truck is because as maybe
some of you might have seen I didn't
look like using chuckers food and
chocolate is like my favorite thing ever
it's like the chicken burger or the
chips that I get all the time
excuse me that I'm playing with my hair
I never had my hair try to sort play
that yes many churches in all these
places that I go to get like my food and
all of you guys like oh hey here's a
chicken thought you'd appreciate this so
thanks for the comments and the tags
guys so family how do the party's been
canceled unfortunately we've got really
really crazy weather right now and
Sydney it's like like I've been saying
it it's quite
overcast and horrible but then out of
nowhere it's just pouring down with rain
I'll show you
can you see those trees like they like
the palm trees all like they've
cancelled because I think it's probably
a bit dangerous which I don't know if
it's dangerous but it's just unlikely
weather I guess they don't know what's
going to happen but yeah it's so
unfortunate this weekend was supposed to
all be part about piling the path we
were all going to go up to Palm Beach
and stay in my place and all going to
festival together but in council so I'm
like what do I do but there's nothing
they can do about it like I'm not
blaming them because the weather is
supposed to be pretty bad for a while
now but um yeah what's the same so I
think tonight we're going to hear it'd
be enough just to get some drinks like
always or constantly at the bener as
well just AZ for all of us to get to so
we might go to the Buena for some drinks
but otherwise yeah I have a 21st
perspective as well which I don't have
any outfits or anything planned for a
completely threw out it was this weekend
I have nothing to wear and I'm pretty
sure it's themed but better get that
organized and yes so just sitting here
drinking my hot chocolate and doing some
emails got some stuff coming up the top
shop again so I've got my Instagram post
to do and I'm doing another videos I
think it's going to be on dresses I
think I'm gonna change it last time is
jeans and then this time I'll do dresses
yeah sometimes as logs turned out really
well and they're really cohesive and
sometimes when I'm editing them I'm like
what have I done this is literally
impossible I have no idea how I'm going
to edit this and then you can't just put
like 30 seconds of music in and then go
back to talking and yeah so we'll see
hopefully this vlog will be easy to EDX
I haven't even tried oh I think though I
will end up here congratulations if
you've got to this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
