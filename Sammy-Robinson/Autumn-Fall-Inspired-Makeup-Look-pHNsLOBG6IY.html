today's video is very exciting because
I'm at Smashbox in LA so I know it's
somewhere at home but I thought it was
appropriate to do a full inside makeup
look today because it's currently full
in LA if you guys like how this makeup
looks and you want to see me at creative
then just keep watching alright so I
already have my base done I've done my
foundation concealer and powder next we
are going to do the eyes and because
we're going for a vampy look a sort of
full inside look I'm going to use lots
of berries and brown so I'm going to use
the fotomat eyes palette by Smashbox
which just has a whole heap of matte
shades in it I'm going to roughly be
using these Browns this sort of very
burgundy shade and maybe a bit of luck
so we'll see how we go so just grabbing
a big fluffy brush I'm going to start
off with a transition say so I'm just
going to take a little bit of this shade
and a little bit of this salmon - I'm
just going to put that through my crease
so using the same brush I'm going to fit
into this medium brown shade and work
that into the crease as well if you feel
like you have any harsh lines just go
back into your transition shade and it
makes it easier to blend everything else
so now I'm going to take a flat shader
brush and I'm going to go into the dark
darker Brown just next to that soft
brown and I'm going to begin to practice
on the outer edge of my eye so now that
we've touched that color on you just let
me take your blending brush again and
just blend out the harsh edges now
taking the flat shader brush again I'm
going to go into this Xhaka burgundy
color and add that in the same spot
closer to the lash line I'm sort of
creating a V on the outer edge of my eye
and getting a lot more precise with the
place to another color now taking a more
precise brush again I'm going to go back
into that purpley shade and then pick up
alliterative flat as well I'm going to
put that on my lash line on me
sort of portion of my lash line so I'm
going to cut my lashes with the full
exposure mascara from Smashbox with a
light coat of mascara so now I'm going
to take some black kohl liner and I'm
just going to tightline my upper lash
line so now I'm just going to jump off
camera and quickly apply some false
lashes and I will be right back okay so
now that I have the eyelashes on I can
see sort of what I want to fix in the
eyeshadow I'm going to get back into
this side here and I'm just going to
darken up the outer corner again I'm
going to take a big fluffy brush and I'm
going to jump into the Smashbox contour
palette and I'm going to take the middle
shade which is pitiful frontier shade
and I'm going to bronze up the outer
perimeter of my face
this will just add a little bit more
voice back into your face and also a
little bit more dimension I am going to
go in and contour as well but this sort
of just is almost the transition for the
contour I'm going to run a little bit
down my jawline as well now I'm going to
take a more precise contour brush and
dip into the side shade here which is
the contour shade I've quite a round
face so I don't like to contour too much
because I don't have the angles there to
begin with
Oh such but I will try to just create a
few shadows just to almost spin out the
face a little bit simple this will spin
out the side of your face and then I'm
going to run a little bit down the side
of my nose as well now I'm going to pick
up his beautiful blush palette it's in
the shade Malibu berry it has got a lot
of deep blast tones in it and I'm going
to pick up the shade rich fairy which is
this one here I think this side will be
perfect at all as it's a lovely deep
berry face and I just put that on the
apples of my cheek and blend ugly
so I'm now going to take these Smashbox
shapematters
palettes this is a great pal because it
has lots of different things you can do
your brows put a little contour kit and
a few eye shadows on the side I'm
actually going to use this highlight
shade today I'm not going to do much
highlighting as I want to keep it quite
a matte look I do like having a bit of
highlight down the center of my nose on
my Cupid's bow and on my ten back
caliber so I'm going to take this little
fluffy domed brush take a little bit of
that highlight and right down the center
of my nose in a little exclamation and
blend that out a little on my Cupid's
bow and then on my ears here and I'm
going to put a bit of that on my brow
bone as well so now jumping onto the lid
which i think is the star of the show I
am using the most beautiful rich
chocolate brown and liquid lipstick but
I'm going to start off with a lip liner
just because obviously when you dark
shade you need to have a splash line of
those it goes everywhere and
semi-permanently
it's really messy so I'm going to take
the always drop lip liner in nudes art
and just lie melon this is the always on
liquid lipstick in the shade tree grit
which is personally my favorite of the
whole range this is one of the most
pigmented look at it six I've ever used
so as you guys can see I don't put
anything on my lower lash line I like to
make sure I keep my eyes quite lifted
but you guys do you if you want to add
something that go ahead and I'm just
going to quickly also spray some of this
primer water over the top of my makeup I
know it says primer water but you can
use it ask your makeup and it just feels
so refreshing
that's the end of the makeup look I hope
