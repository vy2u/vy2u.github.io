as you can probably tell by the title
down below I have over the past few
weeks been shopping a lot because I have
no excuse for it I just shop a lot I've
already used a few of these products in
recent videos that I've done but I've
kept the boxing and stuff because I knew
that I was going to eventually film a
haul so this is a collection of makeup
and clothing and hair products over the
last few weeks so if you want to watch
this whole or it interests you at all
where you want my opinions on any makeup
products or anything like that then
please keep watching I'll start off with
the random stuff because it's just kind
of random hair products and whatnot
I really like argan oil and Moroccan oil
to my hair I feel it keeps it really
silky soft and all that so I saw this
argan oil of Morocco shampoo and
conditioner it just look like that
haven't actually tried this out I will
try it out and let you know if you're
interested in buying me I've been really
obsessed with teas like they saw this
chai spice organic tea from Planet
organic and it just smells so good and
it's got special blends of teas such as
bedtime and detox and stuff so it just
sounded really nice and relaxing before
bed or something like that the next
thing I bought which is just a necessity
for me just always have one is the
batiste dry shampoo I usually have the
big version of it in the floral and
flirty blush one yeah so I usually get
this one here but I mean I sprayed a
little bit of this one and the it's not
quite good so I just wanted to try a
different one out because I've had about
six of the floral ones
and I'm kind of to get this smell it
kind of reminds me of when my hair is
dirty so I wanted to go for a bit more
of a fresh one and see how it goes and I
went to Mecca then I went to Mecca
Maxima and I bought a few things there
again a lot of these things have
actually been showed in previous videos
of mine but that's just because I wanted
to use them straight away and I kept the
boxing and stuff just because I knew I
was going to film a horse so the first
thing I got was this flawless sphere why
can't it just like a beauty blender
I really liked beauty blenders for
blending hidden concealer because you
just run under water make it nice in fat
and then I just use the tip end and just
get all the way in there and just blend
all my concealer out so I really liked
that so the next thing I bought was this
NARS blush in the shade deep throat
I've used this in monitor my videos and
it's just looks like that so just a pink
shade it's really really subtle it just
adds a nice touch of pink to the cheeks
the next thing which has become on my
favorites every small item here is the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil Soleil
bronzer in medium to deep so it just
looks like that again I've showed this
in my videos before and it's just a nice
deep cool toned in my opinion that's
quite cool tone that gives you a scared
to contour and you get you feel like
you're going to get muddy cheeks or just
going to look money on your face
definitely go for that long soul under
well the next thing also from Too Faced
that I got was this naturalised palette
it's just a really small little palette
with a lot of shades a lot of shades a
few shades a medium and a little I mean
there were a medium amount of shades in
it so oh my god this
perhaps ate it to Broadway for yeah it's
just a really nice neutral palette
really good for everyday makeup which I
used in my everyday makeup tutorial as
well another one of my new favorites is
this Smashbox photo filter creamy powder
foundation I have it in the shade 6 so
mine is I think the second darkest shade
of the range and I like to use lighter
powders to set the center of my face
because I use light of concealers there
and then on the rest of my face I'd like
to set the foundation because though as
it disappears and the contour goes money
and all that and this one's really nice
because it really warms up the outer
parts of your face without having to
sharply contour anything so it's kind of
like a subtle bronzer but it's a powder
and it's really soft and silky Mac so
the next thing I bought from Mecca the
next thing I bought from Mecca Maxima
was the bare minerals lip liner so
that's the box and I bought it in the
shade liberated it's kind of reminds me
of a lip liner version of velvet teddy
by Mac just a nude lip liner it's like a
your lips lip better shade it's really
nice
it isn't that dark so I like to use a
saw or whirl by Mac underneath my velvet
teddy just to kind of more define the
outer edges of my lips but I'm quite can
jazz well so if you feel like that is
too dark on you this is definitely a
really good solution liberated by bare
minerals in the lip liner it's wood
little boy so after that I then went
into Mac and I got this mineralized
skinfinish in soft and gentle
I had heard heaps about this but I had
swapped swatched swatched I had swatched
it a few times when I went into Mac and
I didn't like it because compared to my
mary-lou manizer
I felt like it was really glittery but I
caved and I just bought it anyway yeah
it grew on me every time i swatched it
and so I ended up just getting it
I also saw this covergirl outlast stay
fabulous foundation it has SPF 20 the
lasting power of primer coverage over
the concealer and blend ability of a
foundation in one and shine free so had
a good few good things about this one as
well and I've used it once but I used it
without a primer so I'm hoping that's
the reason I didn't like it cuz I
actually didn't like it on my skin at
all cause I'm gonna try it again the
color I got it in is in golden tan
hello Schmucks I went in to Sephora yeah
support and I got just a few things from
Sephora I got this Anastasia Anastasia
Anastasia Anastasia dip brow pomade in
the shade blonde which is what's on my
eyebrows now I love it I think it's
amazing people say it makes their
eyebrows really ashy or Orange and I
don't feel like it does that to me I
don't know maybe in other people's eyes
it does but to me it doesn't I don't
like it very much I also got the big
gimme brow by benefit yeah by benefit
and I got it in the shade light to
medium it does make my eyebrow if I use
too much it does mean my eyebrows look
like they're a bit gray which I don't
like but if you use just a little amount
it adds a nice fibers and sets your
brows in place all day like it honestly
is the best setting mascara that I have
so I got this Kat Von D lipstick in
noble I don't like nudes because I feel
like it just looks like a moon
foundation on my lips so I always like
it to have a certain tinge of some sort
to it and it's not the smoothest of
consistency like the formula isn't
amazing but I do like the color like
I'll show you the exam paper my goal to
tell you right now if I feel like I've
gone for a really dark eye look I do
like to add it to send out add it to the
center of my
lips and it kind of just lightens up
well but Teddy or any darker lipstick
that you're wearing so I don't know if
you can tell what is that did anything I
can be my mirror but but yeah if you add
anything to the center of your lips it
actually plants up your lips and makes
them look a little bit bigger so another
lipstick I got from Kat Von D is the
liquid lipstick in the shade
Jefferey so it's a really pretty color
but some would you say like a Barbie
pink maybe residue not the best to
explaining colors really the lip gloss
applicator and it kind of goes onto your
lips as a lip gloss but then it dries
completely matte and it stays on your
lips like without Shanae coming off I
bought these two little Sephora just
empty containers that you can just fill
with whatever it may be that you need to
take that you don't want to take the
whole big thing so then I went to make a
Maxima again a different day different
time different location well maybe I had
money in the bank and now I know anyway
I got a few products from there as well
I've always wanted to try this
bareMinerals concealer but it's a powder
and it's called well-rested and you put
it over your conceal on your under eyes
and oh my lord
this is too bad for it honestly so
concealer and brightens everything at
the same time it's amazing I will show
you in a tutorial it is I also got this
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
is the pore minimizing one and
tried it once so far so good
tried enough to tell I'll let you know
I'll do a makeup tutorial with it or
something I'll let you know because I
used it once and I can't really say at
the moment I really wanted to try the
new NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation so I got it except morbidly
which I actually don't regret because I
figured it out I got the shade in Tahoe
which is so dark what I do is I mix my
NARS sheer glow in Stromboli and my NARS
all day luminous weightless foundation
in Tahoe
and it makes such a beautiful color or
what I do is I add the Tahoe around the
outside of my face and then I fill my
poor areas with my NARS Stromboli and
yeah that's also another beautiful combo
so yeah I'm actually quite glad that I
got this in such a dark color because I
like it
but when it comes back into stock
because I know it's not like sold out in
a lot of places the cons I can stock I
would like to get it in the shade
I would like to do it in the shade a
different shade I know the shade climbs
in the shade but a different shade I
also got this Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray I've heard a lot of
good things about this as well it's by
Scandinavia it sets your makeup I have
two other ones which I like as well
don't really notice what they do these
my filming just came off on us anyway
this kind of gives me a Jewish I feel
like it makes me look a little bit wet
to the face which once it obviously
dries cuz it is wet it just gives me
quite a dewy finish that's like my NYX
or NYX Julie finish spray as well but if
I just want just kind of a setting spray
that I feel like will just hold my
makeup in place I would use this
Australis makeup what I would use this
makeup Australia's make up finishing
spread - it's also does the job so this
is a much more affordable option than
this one I actually take how much this
cost
I will check how much it costs see it's
44 dollars as opposed it's 44 dollars as
opposed to this Australia's make up
finishing spread switch just like 20
bucks I think I actually don't know you
can check in personal yeah this is much
more affordable option if you don't want
to spend the money but this is also a
really nice and dewy finish sets makeup
eyelashes so I bought like three or four
pairs of the natural ones which are
actually really short they're actually
the length of my eyelashes naturally but
what's cool about it is when you stick
them on it just makes your eyelashes
look ten times thicker so it doesn't
give you length but it gives you a lot
of volume so if you're looking for a
really natural eyelash option this is
really good for that I also got the
house of lashes in pixie luxe and in
iconic and not gonna lie I find these
much harder to apply then say red cherry
or Ardell or yeah these are much harder
to apply than the average eyelash so
this for me I would only wear these I'm
like a serious night out or like a
really glamorous event cuz they're quite
big quite thick then my favorite makeup
product that I have got within the last
few weeks is this makeup baked eyeshadow
palette pretty much I'm in love with
makeup geek eyeshadows so they have a
range of eyeshadows which just come in
little pans like this and you can just
take it out has a name on the back and
then you just stick it into your Z
palette Zen palette is the palette Z
palette anyway I got 14 eyes shadows and
one blush this blush is a made so I have
a whole heap of matte shades that I like
to use a string transition shades in my
crease
which I have in my crease apps at the
moment I have I have a peach smoothie at
peach smoothie and frappe in my crease
at the moment with a bit of prepping as
well and maca kind of on that outermost
edge then there we have three shimmery
shades as well just amazing and it's all
magnetic and so convenient and just so
that's the end of this hall I hope you
guys have enjoyed it let me know in the
comments what you'd like to see from me
next time because I know I'm going to
film an everyday makeup tutorial like a
natural kind of everyday what I actually

lot of you guys asked for that so I'll
