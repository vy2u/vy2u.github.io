today's video is going to be a snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A I'm going to be gone for about four
days in Melbourne and then I'll be back
in Sydney for a few days for New Year's
and then I'll be going again for about
seven days with Nick in Fosters
um beer so I thought today I would do a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A the last Q&amp;amp;A for 2016 and I
haven't done a snapchat one before so I
thought what better than to get a few
videos of you guys in it with me to
finish off 2016 so um they're coming in
like crazy I'll just start opening them
and just yeah let's just get straight
into it oh my god this is nerve-wracking
I haven't done this before so I'm gonna
get well like hot and flustered I hope
you guys will be able to see it okay hi
Sydney I was just learning what your
best part about 2016 was love you oh
that's such a sweet question love you
too obviously my friends and family but
I've known them for years so I'd have to
say the best part of 2016 was meeting
Nick meeting my boyfriend I met him back
in March and I'm completely and utterly
in love with him obsessed with him he's
just everything so he has to be
definitely the best part of my 2016 for
sure okay
so pretty um best place that I visited
in Europe would have to be Amsterdam or
Greece they're completely different
places I like I said in my QA when I
came back from Europe loved AB Sam as a
city it was so beautiful it was like
being in a picture book I've never been
anywhere like that and then Greece was
just the most fun so much fun everyone
raves about Greece and I absolutely
loved it definitely lived up to my
expectations
wildfire hi Sammy our question is would
you ever get a tattoo and I would say
worthy and why would it be um I mean I
think I've always wanted to get a tattoo
but I don't think I'd ever be able to
bring myself to do it I love tattoos and
I love tattoos on other people I love
all cardio's tattoos my boyfriend has a
tattoo on his forearm here I've always
wanted to tattoo I just don't think I'd
ever actually do it guys I studied slash
and studying so I haven't dropped out
I've just referred this semester that
I'm studying public communications which
is sort of a PR course which is what I
want to get into later in life I think
I'm not sure probably will change but
that was sort of when I left school my
main goal um and I don't think I have
many hidden talents if I did I would
show you guys all the time I don't think
it would be hidden I think I'd be pretty
arguing about it hey Sammy it's Olivia
and I just wanted to know what your
all-time favorite ice cream flavor
oh no I'm loving these questions they're
all so different my favorite ice cream
flavor would have to be chocolate just
cuz I'm a massive tracker holic
otherwise maybe Putin cream hey thirty
love you Channel just wondering if
you're ever going to come to
then please also I'm obsessed with your
box as soon as II press one I go
straight on Twitter so would you ever
consider doing like a daily vlog or a
vlogging channel just a separate one um
I think I'm what was the first question
oh my god I forgot Oh am I ever coming
to Melbourne I think it was I was born
in Melbourne so I'm in Melbourne go my
whole family lives in Melbourne like my
extended family my actual family lives
in Sydney with me we moved when I was a
baby because dad got a job in Sydney but
we're all Melbourne people so yeah I go
to velvet all the time so maybe I'll run
into you one day
Oh bit too quick didn't say that
Portelli you're so pretty and I love
your videos and then I just wanted to
ask what is your favorite make your
product that you could not live without
um probably depending on the day
sometimes I'm completely fine with I'm
fair from about sneeze yeah well I'm not
very good oh now my eyes are all red um
probably depending on the day sometimes
I'm okay with my skin and don't need any
foundation um so sometimes it would be
mascara I like to wear mascara but
sometimes I wake up and the bags under
my eyes are like gray and puffy and
horrible so sometimes concealer if I
could live anywhere else in the whole
entire world I would probably go to LA
or New York I'd say um there's a lot of
beautiful places in the world that I
would 100 someone a visit again but I
don't know if I would live there um but
yeah probably LA or New York has a lot
of opportunities so that would probably
be one of the places your outfit is
really so amazing so I'm making a song
inspirations love you said um my spot I
actually get asked this quite often I
don't really have a specific style
inspiration and I don't really know
where I get my style from I just say
something and I
really love it and I get my deer for an
outfit in my head and I just like to put
it together so yeah obviously as many of
you guys would be the same you know you
look at Instagram and you get
inspiration from lots of things but um
yeah I don't really have a specific
style icon I kind of just like what I
see and then just try and mix and match
I've always been that way when my um mom
bought me a dress for my birthday when I
was little and it wasn't poofy enough
like the princesses so when I was
younger I got a cardboard box and I cut
a hole out of the top of it and I put it
over my hips onto my waist and I put my
dress over the top of it so that it
would be like a ball gown
so like ever since I was little I always
just had ideas in my head and then I
like to just just go for it really thank
you um I use the canon g7x of logging
and for filming I use the Canon 70d what
happened with my previous boyfriend
together for about a year a year and a
half I think and I think we just sort of
fell out of love we just became best
friends and um yeah just like anyways
sort of yeah became more friends and
moved on I suppose um I guess I'm not
exaggerating I'm not even joking when I
tell you I don't have an exercise
routine I have so much cellulite on my
butt I am not fit and I am not saying
I'm fat I'm not saying I'm big but I
just I don't exercise that is my new
year's resolution for 2017 I'm going to
start going to the gym you get a trainer
and I'm gonna get fit oh I will hundred
said share it with you guys if I ever do
get really into it but um I don't want
to lie to you guys and give you
something that I don't do because I just
I might go for the occasional walk but
otherwise
I don't ever go to the gym well
beautiful love you too my favorite
perfume well it's not here is the
Michael Kors original so I wear that all
the time I've worn it for years and
years and gone through so many bottles
of it hey Sammy
so I just woke up and I saw that your
snapchat was on public my question is
what's the most rebellious thing you've
done your parents don't know about
uh-huh I'm very open with my parents I
tell my parents almost everything I ever
do when I sneak out I tell them probably
yeah I snuck out a lot
I had parties without them which went
awfully wrong I drank all that alcohol
yeah I've just done the classic teenager
naughty things but I've already told
them so it's not really a surprise to
them yeah look if you guys ask this
actually my living situation I'm in a
flat on top of my house so I have my
whole family living in a house down
below me and then what you guys see in
my vlogs this whole area up here is mine
I say we just like to say I love your
channel and I was just wondering how
tall you are
hmm also very commonly asked question I
am just under six foot tall so I'm
pretty tall I like question I want to go
to Mexico and Central America in July
instead of Europe hey my friends are
going to go to New Zealand skiing so
I'll probably hire an air B&amp;amp;B and do a
big big group of us just go skiing angel
