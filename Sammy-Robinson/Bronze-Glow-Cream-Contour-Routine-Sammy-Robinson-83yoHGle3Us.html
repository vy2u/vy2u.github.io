you so much for watching today I filmed
this bronzy fresh sort of cream contour
makeup routine I know a lot of people
are going to be saying oh my god she's
has so many products in her face I most
definitely do not do this every day this
is just a routine for people that like
to use cream contour products or just
want to achieve this glowy kind of
bronzy makeup look I paired it with a
bronzy I also in just a nude lip so you
can do whatever you want with the eyes
and lips but yeah I just gave me that
option too also I just wanted to
apologize for being a bit maa lately I
had a lot of troubles with my old camera
it didn't focus when I wanted to and
I've actually filmed four videos and all
of them unfortunately failed so that's
why we were on a new camera today with a
new background so I hope you guys enjoy
this new setting let me know if you like
it also in case anyone's wondering this
chop is from Calvin Klein channels if
you can't cry and like open it and it's
like a dark grey so yeah that's where
that's from and yeah so I hope you guys
enjoy this makeup routine I'll see you
next time bye
excuse my face guys I look like a dead
zombie because I've had pneumonia for
the last few months but yeah I'm
starting out with the second darkest
shade of the cover FX contour kit and
I'm just running that over all the
contour spots so my temples on my
forehead my cheekbones my jawline along
the sides of my nose and yeah just those
spots
I'm then taking this lightest sort of
cream contour product and I'm running
that just below the forehead contour and
just above the cheekbone contour because
it just makes the blending process a lot
easier when it comes to burning out
afterwards I'm just taking my NARS
creamy concealer in the shade vanilla
and I'm running that just along the
sides of my nose up in a triangle
underneath my eyes and just turn on the
other side as well then I'm also running
it down the bridge of my nose afterwards
on my chin my Cupid's bow my forehead
and underneath my cream contour my
cheeks
and then spraying my beauty blender and
I'm beginning to blend out the darkest
parts of the contour into my hairline
and my cheekbones just to get the
darkest bits blended so then you can go
into the light afterwards and blend that
into the darker bits once you have your
shape and formations set up so when I
begin to blend out the lighter bits I
just flip to the other side of the
beauty blender just so that you don't
mix too many of the colors together and
you keep your highlighter nice and
bright and then just blending over all
my whole face just to make sure
everything is seamlessly blended and
there's no harsh lines anywhere picking
up my AC mTOR contour and highlighting
kit I'm taking the two lighter shades
and I'm just placing patting that under
my eyes on my nose my chin and my
forehead
to set the rest of my face I'm taking my
hourglass powder in dim light and this
will just ensure that you keep a nice
glow to your skin and you don't
completely mattify your skin it's a
really nice powder and it doesn't add
any color or anything it just makes sure
you you stay nice and glowy then picking
up this sunkissed bronzer it's just a
color wheel with lots of shimmery
bronzes I'm just running that over the
bronze parts of my faces just to give it
a really nice glow
and to set the contour shades of the
cream contour and to deepen the color
I'm taking my Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I'm just running that over
the dark spots as well just taking up
the contour
I'm then taking a denser brush and just
running that bronzer down the sides of
my nose just to straighten my nose out a
little then taking this Australis blush
and the bronzer kit I have no idea
what's wrong I'll try and list it down
below
I'm just running that on my cheeks it
has a bit of shimmer in it as well so
it'll just help you stay nice and glowy
as well then I'm taking this amazing
highlighter from Becca it's in the shade
opal it's my new favorite highlighter
hands down and I'm just running that
over my higher point of my cheekbone a
little bit on my forehead again I'm
doing it on my nose and my Cupid's bow
and just giving my face in the overall
glow as you can probably tell by now I'm
going for a very dewy glowy skin look so
yeah it's a nice bronzy summery look
even though we're basically in winter
then just set all of that in place I'm
just spraying my face with that Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray and I'm
just gonna do my eyebrows off-camera
so as you can see I've just taken my max
Paint Pot in soft ochre and I'm just
setting that down as a base and then
setting the Pape pot with some powders
just because powders blend easier and
powder so you want your eyeshadows to
blend easily and then I'm taking these a
few of these makeup geek shadows so I'll
list them down below because I don't
know them off the top of my head but
yeah so just check the down box for the
colors that I've used I'm mainly using
them as transition shades for the bronze
shade I'll be using later so just
setting down a nice transition shade in
my crease
so I'm taking this gorgeous eye shadow
from gorgeous and it's just a really
nice bronzy shade again I don't know the
shades name but I'll list it down below
I'm just running that on my outer-v and
through my crease just to deepen up the
eye look
and then again I'll be taking my
highlighter in the shade opal from Becca
and just running that on my lid I'm
using my ring finger to pack it on
because it just is so much more intense
than using your brush but then I'll go
in with the brush and just make sure the
edges are just diffused and blended in
with the bronze color then again picking
up the bronze eyeshadow I'm running that
on my lash line and just making sure all
the edges are blended so blending it
with the top apples again taking the
highlighter I'm putting that on my inner
tear duct and on my brow bone just
underneath my eyebrows
picking up my butterfly wings in the sky
from l'oréal I'm just putting a really
light coat of mascara on my top lashes
just before I put my falsies on just
creates a nice base for them to sit on
then the red cherry number 16 so you
couldn't really see it I'm just putting
them on with my hands because my toe is
kind of broken so
so while I'm letting my top lash glue
dry I'm just gonna go in with some scar
on my bottom lashes
and then I'm taking this lipliner from
Mac it's in the shade saw it's just a
deep deeper version of well in my
opinion and I'm just running out over my
lips and filling in the majority of the
lips not anything too neat because I'm
going over with it
with a lipstick afterwards so taking
this lipstick from Lime Crime I'm just
putting it's in the shade croquet I'm
just running that over the top of saw it
just gives it a darker effect this
lipsticks quite light and I don't like
light nudes on me so I'm just making
sure I ran this or underneath it to
deepen the color a little bit so that's
the final look
well that's the end of the makeup
routine guys I hope you have enjoyed it
if you did make sure you give it a big
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel to
see more from me otherwise I'll see you
guys next time I hope you have a lovely
day
