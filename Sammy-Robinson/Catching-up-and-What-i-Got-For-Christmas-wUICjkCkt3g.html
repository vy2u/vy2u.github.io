oh good morning everybody
excuse the messy head I've just been on
a walk with days and I look fabulous
clearly so it is currently 10:20 a.m.
and I have a conference call at 11:00 so
we're going to write down some notes and
um get prepared of that but yeah I've
got a lot of emails to do's now that I'm
back and I'm going to jump in the pool
I'll have a shower and then I'll have a
chat to you guys so I thought I would
just start this vlog say hello but um
yeah so it's just going to be a little
daily vlog I'm not going not going to
make it a week because I just have a lot
to update you guys thought I'd show you
my Christmas presents and things like
that
okay so just got off the phone call and
to Sportsgirl I'm doing sort of a little
sports girl series which is so exciting
and they've sent me a whole bunch of
makeup and I'm sort of reviewing and
doing a few videos with them it's really
exciting because I used to buy so much
sports girl makeup when I started
getting into makeup and I absolutely
loved it I'm doing sort of a series so
there's gonna be like a highlighting and
contouring and then they'll be like a
party makeup look and I've used the
makeup and it's actually awesome so I'm
really excited for you guys to see that
it'll be up this month probably later
this month so and then I have just like
quite a lot of emails to do in a bit of
organizing I just opened
the most amazing package from Kelly and
Kate and they just sent me a whole bunch
of they're they're sort of university
sports sports team clothes so they have
a basketball t-shirt and jumper and they
sent me some cool hats that I'll match
with Nick and they wrote me the most
lovely letter so thank you girls that
was absolutely lovely I'm actually I'm
actually wearing your top and we're
exercising today so thank you so much
girls that was so so lovely of you but I
love this singlet
a lot of use out of it by the way I got
my nails taken off and they are
absolutely trashed I'm just going to
give them some time off so that um they
can heal themselves so I'm just making
myself a you foods I'm going to go with
the tacos these are so yummy
here are some things coming up this
month oh how gorgeous is this handbag I
need it so I just got out of the pool
and I thought um I'm literally not doing
anything else I got I got sent a whole
bunch of new makeup from Charlotte
Tilbury and Garbo and Kelly again so I
thought why not just sit down and play
with makeup with you guys and I'll just
chat with you guys because I feel like I
haven't filmed in so long because I did
pre-recorded video so this is going to
be the lightest amount of makeup I'm
really I really can't be bothered to
wear makeup so I'm just going to do sort
of base and then some mascara probably
so I'm going to try the Urban Decay
quick-fix Hydra charge complexion prep
primary spray alright smells really good
hmm
give me some of that and now Charlotte
Tilbury sent me so many products and I
love Charlotte Tilbury so she sent me
the Wonder glow instant soft focus in
the large bottle I had this little
tester version of it and I loved it so I
think they sent me this one as well how
beautiful and luxe is the packaging it's
gonna be so weird me doing my makeup
with out my nails I feel like my fingers
are so stubby yeah by the way I'm just
wearing a swimming costume this is
Shani's collaboration with white locks
boutique it's such a cool swim swimming
costume I've never seen anything like
this top covergirl foundation I'm just
going to take the smallest amount of it
because I don't really so hot today and
I really don't want to be wearing too
much foundation so how have you all been
how was your Christmas how was your New
Year's can you guys comment down below
what you guys got up to I would love to
know as you guys know I was in Barwon
heads with my family over Christmas then
we came back to Sydney for New Year's
and then sorry one second I got a
foundation brush up top buffer brush
from zoeva and then yes I came back to
Sydney
years we ended up just um going to my
friend starting off at my house and
having some drinks because you can see
the bridge from my house um and then we
went to Holly's house and we just had
like a few of our friends over and just
had a really chilled night I feel like
this has made my face paler well I'm
going to take the Charlotte Tilbury
beachtek lip to cheek
juvie colour-pop in Ibiza which looks
like a bronzer some user as a cream
bronzer it's like a really warm tone
bronzer that's really nice I've got the
slit in my eyebrow my brother got a
razor for Christmas and he got it out on
Christmas Day and was just sort of like
my all my cousins were like bring slits
in their eyebrows and in their hair and
stuff and so on New Year's he got it out
again and drunk old me was like yeah I
was lit so now I have it was only a
little one so it wasn't too bad it was
pretty funny I don't really care too
much about it but I do look back at
things I do when I'm drunk and I'm like
why
okay I need to tell my icon on this is
crazy
I get so sweaty in this spot from right
next to my window so what else yes then
me and Nick left for foster relatively
soon after New Year's like on the second
we stayed near today just to chill out
with our friends and then we left
hello I'm just putting a bit of
concealer on just cuz my bags I don't
think I look so strange
trying to put concealer on look at makes
my eyes I'm really beady but yes anyway
back to my trip to foster so it was just
Nick and I and I didn't vlog it because
I wanted to put the camera down and just
enjoy it I did snapchat the whole thing
so if you guys if you guys follow me on
snapchat you were seeing what we got up
to and if you don't I'll leave it on the
screen so you can add me but I just
wanted to put the camera away and just
enjoy it with Nick because it honestly
was
so amazingly we did so much stuff with
golf tennis fishing went to the beach we
went to all different restaurants
tappers Mexican sushi Italian we just
did everything and it was just the most
amazing time now I'm taking it the same
Charlotte over a stick thing it's the
beach stick lip to check lip to cheek in
Foreman formentera
it's just like a really nice deep rosy
colors make her cheeks that some rosy
cream blushes and cream contours I like
my favorite thing about we don't need to
add blush because I feel like I look
really flushed but love that that's such
a nice color too I could come to a kit
and an eyeshadow palette from Garbo and
Kelly as well and I used their
highlighting and eyebrow thing I use the
eye brow pomade now religiously I've
been using all the time they have really
great product so I'm going to use this
banana shade to set rounder eyes because
my under eyes look really strained right
now
at all the shades I'm going to do this
one for contour I'm going to use it's
called Vivian it's a really nice rosy
shade as well that'll go with the
Charlotte Tilbury one I love deep blush
tones so now that I'm back to filming
I'm going to be trying to do two videos
a week again one vlog and one sit-down
video except for for the month of
January I'm going to stick to more
fashion-forward videos so I'm going to
try incorporate holes and different
styles so you guys always ask me where I
get my basic tops and singlets and stuff
from so I'll do a whole and like basics
and then I'll do a sporty haul and then
I'll do maybe like a party haul or I'm
not sure like I haven't decided yet but
I'm going to try and show you guys a lot
more of my fashion and I'm going to take
my steal a huge extreme lash mascara
told you guys my new year's resolution
I'm wanting to do a lot more physical
activity get myself fit cuz i'm a jelly
bubble like honestly i am i just want to
tone up my body i don't really care so
much about weight loss but i just want
to be able to like sam fitter like i'm i
walk up a flight of stairs and i think
i'm gonna die so i just want to be able
to toe my buddy up and get a lot fitter
so I've joined a Pilates class and I'm
going to do some Pilates try and do like
some walking with my friends like on a
daily basis just try and do like a bit
of exercise every single day which I
didn't analyze used to maybe exercise
one once a week I was lucky and I used
to be such a sporty person and I'm just
not not being recently and it's just
it's really sad because it was like the
number one thing in my life so
I'm going to put some Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick on it's in the shade very
Victoria God my lashes look strange God
it's high because when I will make one I
feel so weird I feel like I look so BD
and so weird
oh that's soft
that's a really nice color but it was
gonna be darker but it's actually pretty
sheer I'll be seeing cardio I'll
probably be doing I'm a bum maybe I'm
not sure yet but I booked them if you
guys haven't seen oh I should I don't
even know if I've described this on my
channel but come on snap chat cardi has
challenged me to do a mock button which
is basically where you order heaps and
heaps and heaps of food and you just
kind of sit down and chat a bit so I
thought when I hit 300k I would do that
as sort of like a celebration it's gonna
be a really random video but it'd be
funny I hope I don't think they're gonna
be funny it's just really random you
just literally watch me eat but
something a bit different I think I'm
going to put a bit of this over the top
of my makeup because I think it works
it's both you can just like set your
face with it and then use it throughout
the day a few things that I got um a
spire candle in French pear she got me a
little acquire set which has a little
candle and then also a diffuser and it's
in the flavor guava I've got a little
Tommy Hilfiger set so it's the little
bralette and then the matching underwear
top the gosset Tommy sent those to me so
that's really lovely mum got me a few
little pieces of exercise gear this is
this is a long slow you've exercised
trot but really nice and thin because
she knows I'm going to try and get into
exercise now so the best way to do that
is the best so inspire yourself is to
buy yourself heaps of exercise gear I
feel like it gets you so into it and
then I got a cute little bra let it's
just a nice little blue one under white
singlet so it just spices the outfit up
a bit and it matches blue eyes really
nicely
my cousin Steffi got me this beautiful
candle this is probably the most
beautiful candle I have ever seen
it's from Avalos volu volume spa and
it's crane flour coconut wax
um it's just a candle and it smells so
good
it's just so intricate stunning I'm also
got me this little um I don't even know
what you would call this it's a little
pouch that I can keep my front door
put on their keys and things in because
I like throwing my keys and cards and
wallets all over the place so I'll just
keep it all in this so you guys might
know how obsessed I am with cocktails so
my brother got me a little bar compass
which is like you spin it and it tells
you what cocktail you to make I just I
was really cute and something that's
cute to keep in the kitchen even though
I don't have ingredients for cocktails
all the time it's just a cute little
thing to keep in your bar area these are
probably my two favorite things that mom
got me at 2017 7 bit behind diary and
then a Kate Spade notebook because I
struggled to keep all my notes in my
diary I feel like I don't have enough
room to write everything that I want so
often what I do is I have a notebook on
the side to sort of write down my ideas
and what I have to do that day in detail
but the best part about this to this to
this but the best part about this diary
which is from little Finch is that that
each day comes with its own day so it's
quite a thick book but so this is
Thursday and I've got the whole thing
for Thursday how often do is have like
little sections each thing this gives
you a whole day plus lines and so it's
just a really neat way of giving
yourself to-do lists and writing things
down then this Kate Spade book is so
beautiful it's got engraved with s which
obviously is for Kate Spade but I just
like to think it's for me and then my
mom got me a Tiffany and Co necklace mum
went to New York recently and my sisters
went so she got us all sort of matching
necklaces like a sister necklace so it's
got two little pendants coming off it
one is rose gold and then one is silver
and they both have the Tiffany and Co
logo on it which i think is really cute
so that's nice to have to match the
sisters and then I also got this
beautiful Tiger Lily candle as well I
think Tiger Lily collaborated with
glasshouse yeah they did and they made
the most beautiful box and the scent is
coconut lemon and lime and then the last
thing I got from mum was this Michael
Kors
bracelet i generate generally
wouldn't wear something this chunky
because you guys know I like quite
delicate jewelry but this is so cool
because it's a Fitbit so I don't know if
you guys have ever heard of Fitbit but
it's the thing that can track your steps
and how much activity you're doing in a
day so I just loved that because it's a
it's jewelry it's not that you know that
black thing around your wrist so you can
still sort of pretend it's jewelry but
it is just tracking your fitness and
things like that which is cool my
sister's but they're all downstairs so I
just got a whole bunch of books from my
uncle and Katie got me a little Pandora
ring and Jessica got me lollies and what
else did she get me I think she got me
she got me the bralette that was from
Jessica and finally from Nick I got this
ring well I don't know if you guys can
see it but basically you guys know I've
had this circle ring this ring is from
grace so when I was in Bret in Santorini
with the girls we wanted a piece of
jewelry that would symbolize our
friendship and that we could take home
from us from a trip so we got this in a
little jewelry store in Greece and I've
worn it ever since I haven't taken it
off so then Nick got Nick knew that I
loved my circle ring so he got me an
oval it's it's really really delicate
this one and it's gold and then it has a
little diamond I don't know if you guys
can see if it has a little diamond just
on the side there so that is so
beautiful I'm so obsessed and I'm so
embarrassed to like show my hands now
because I don't have nails on I feel
really naked but um yeah I absolutely
love those this is from Sarah and
Sebastian and if any of you were
wondering so yes that's all I got um god
I know this is going to be a really long
video so I'm just I'm thinking I'm just
going to end it here I hope you guys
have enjoyed this video I know it's like
a lot of rambling I feel like I've been
talking for hours but I just wanted to
update you guys and talk to you exactly
I came and talked to you in ages so I
love you guys lots and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
