is going to go today because as I'm sure
you guys are well aware I've said and
like everything on my recent videos it's
very gloomy in Sydney at the moment so
summer is officially over and the
weather has left the good weather has
left so it's very gray outside and which
means I'm not sure how well that's going
to translate on camera yeah I thought
today I've got my smoothie I actually
bought myself a copy as well as I've got
my frizzy and my coffee that's what
today I could just do a really chilled
sit down get ready with me I haven't
done one in ages
oh I don't know if I don't want to
ventures I feel like I do have always
had in my vlogs but I haven't made just
an actual sit down get ready with me and
but so many of you guys can tell me hey
darling and I've so many of you guys
tell me you want more dramatic looks for
me so I'm going to just try and do
something really really dark I'm gonna
start off with my Charlotte Tilbury
Wonder glow to rooming in an apprentice
elf or something different and never
wear my hair in a ponytail but try to
change things up you know I'm really not
sure about this lighting okay so I have
two foundations here one that I've been
wearing all the time my go-to
foundations at the moment have been live
in my two favorites at the moment this
is what I've been wearing every day sort
of on an everyday basis but I feel like
because we're going full glam I want to
try like a heavier foundation I've tried
this a few times it's not new to me but
I don't wear that often so and the way
this one today is hourglass in warm
beige yeah I just never really got into
it I'm going to go so foreground guys
I'm really excited I've used so many
products have you have buff that in with
the brush that they say to buff it in
with this little brush here it's a
really good brush so this is perfect for
my skin colored moments also fading now
that summers leaving I'm not a time
anymore so I can start wearing a lot of
the foundations that I haven't been wear
in ages again now I'm going to use my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in
medium light neutral who might be a bit
alike that's right you see how it goes
on the print button from my jacket
making that noise now I'm going to take
my Sportsgirl contour stick this is a
really good cuddle stick and it's super
cool paint as you can see and it's very
pigmented so I'm not going to put too
much on I'm going to blend that out with
the same brush I use this when I'm
wanting to more contour and then I use
my clinic chubby stick when I want more
bronzing this is my favorite one as well
so cuz I'm going to move on to the eyes
I mean use this I'm inspired by this
court here I'm just going to bake my
under eyes and my eyelid ie I've been
using the cover FX perfect setting
powder it's really good they all get the
job done this is going to be hard to do
a dramatic eye look when I have my
eyelash extensions on well let's see
here we go
I have discord here and it's physican in
anastasia beverly hills quant pelleting
but i'm pretty sure the only one that is
a nostalgia is this guy here and he's
warm type the rest of colour-pop my wife
wave is vaguely starting out with warm
taupe i'm just going to run that through
my crease so how do you guys mean I went
to my meetup this weekend that was part
of Tuesday today and I went to the
meetup on Saturday and it was so amazing
it was so amazing I have a blog out
about it but yeah it was so so much fun
with solar balls meaning so many of you
guys I was such a nervous wreck
beforehand but it was actually like the
best day of us and I think like I got I
was like 5 and I was
selves banana blueberry soy milk and
honey so honey on the same brush I'm
going to get into dish a now I'm just
going to put it through the crease as
well this is color pot I'll leave all
the shades in the description box so you
guys can see if you're interested if it
start looking in this mirror darkly I
was it's quite huge mirror if you're
always wondering why I'm looking a good
big Marineros my little desk mirror is
just here and I feel like whenever I
look into it I'm looking down too much
and you guys can't see so but yes back
onto the Meetup it was so funny how many
as you were so shocked at how tall I am
I feel like I try and say quite often in
my videos that I am just under 6 foot
but I feel like I feel like every time
someone meets me they always always get
shocked and how tall I am
they just start saying it in every video
just introducing myself like hi guys
welcome back to my channel I'm 6 foot
tall today we're going to do this makeup
tutorial now music this shade right here
and I'm going to build that through the
crease as well and the outer be just
really deepening up the eye look gosh
these color pop shades are so pigmented
miss super super blendable as well which
is amazing because when you're working
with dark shades like this animated
blend out absolutely nightmare anywho so
I would love you guys to let me know
down in the comments what videos you
would like to see for me I definitely
don't feel stuck in a rut because I've
been loving blogging so I feel like I'm
constantly filming that and getting up
weekly blogs for you guys and then other
random videos here and there but yeah if
there's anything that I'm not doing at
the moment that you guys are interested
in seeing definitely let me know Amy I'm
gonna use my steel really I'm going to
use discolor down here as well oh my god
I didn't even think up more product to
send sorry crazy
oh sorry pretty I love how that purple
looks with the blue I don't think I will
have the ready shade and put that
through my crease because I think the
purple and the Reds look awesome with
the blue
I think I'll go back into the castle and
digging it up a little bit more and
outer edges so now this is where I
struggle because I never wear anything
on my lower lashline pick up the blue
shave I'm going to run that underneath
my lash line and then on the same brush
I'm just going to flip it around and
take some of the red shade and I'm going
to smoke it out now from the scar I'm
going to take my still a huge extremist
mascara and it's bail as my lashes the
either side dark I was looking like a
little bit washed out so I'm going to
put some bronzer on now to take the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I used to
love this product Henry Henry
okay okay to use this all the time but
like it's in my other makeup drawer so I
have my like sort of everyday stuff in a
drawer down here and then I'm going to
draw like back there in the corner with
all my other stuff and I just like I'm
so lazy I should never go and reach for
it and now I'm going to take my hoola
bronzer by magnet I love this brush this
is the best brush for contouring so I'm
just going to contour agree with that
now I'm going to take my spot scale on
the globe Sunkist
talat and I've been liking mixing these
together I like a tiny bit in both like
that and then so you can see how they're
quite mad
like what
because oh my inner tear ducts ought to
use a tinted eyebrow gel this one use
the 3d proud homes by benefit in the
shade number two it's going to line my
lips with my bare minerals lip line up
in OnPoint
I mean I over draw my looks a little bit
I love all the bare minerals nude ones
there are such good nude lip liners so
this is because the thing ever I'm so
excited to show you guys a lot of you
guys asked in my last vlog I was wearing
at the beginning and he hates it you
guys ask this is the lift rock matte
cream matte lip cream but I don't know
the color of it so this is how it looks
like I'm sure you'd be able to find it
in store if you win it's like a my
favorite everyday lipstick right now it
just goes into everything so I was
looking very tired I don't know
something about wearing something about
wearing lower lash line makeup makes me
look really tired that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed it it was a
lot of fun to film this book this
experiment more with makeup because I
obviously have so much fun doing it I
used to do it all the time like all the
time I will probably just end the video
here I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
hope you guys are having a lovely day so
far Dave day night whenever you're
watching this
and I love you so much and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
