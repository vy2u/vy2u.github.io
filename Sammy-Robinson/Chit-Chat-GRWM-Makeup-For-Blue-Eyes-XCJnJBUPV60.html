thank you so much for watching so today
I've done a video using all products
from Sephora calm a you it's really
awesome I reckon because but Aziz can
now access the flora products I know
that I live in Sydney so I've actually
visited the Sephora story in the city in
Sydney but I know that a lot of other
states can't access Sephora products so
it's really awesome now that we have
Sephora kaamdar you and we can get a
whole bunch of those brands that we
couldn't really access that easily
before but yeah if you guys want to see
how I got this sort of Maroney berry
smokey eye then please keep watching I
put my hair up long pants right now and
it's just not a good idea it's where's
your heart think I'm gonna go change my
hair falls out and looks just shocking
this whole video I apologize but it's
being held up by just this one little
stingy clip okay so let's get started
um this is the first video I filmed in
ages so because I've didn't I did my New
Zealand vlogs and then my other videos I
haven't been talking I haven't talked to
him for a while so it's so really I
haven't talked to my videos ages so yeah
I'm gonna do a full face of makeup using
all four products so it's using any
products that you can get off
sephora.com a year so I'm gonna start
off with benefits the professional and
I'm gonna take a little bit of that just
in and around my t-zone it's filling in
any pores this stuff is amazing for
smoothing smoothing out any skin and
filling in any pores it does such a good
job
I'm now going in with my Becca ultimate
coverage complexion cream it's just a
foundation and I'm in the shade bamboo
which is a little bit too dark for me
but I'm just gonna wear a little bit and
see how I go
it's quite a thick foundation but it's
got really really amazing coverage so if
you're into a really nice sort of full
coverage foundation this one's amazing
cuz I haven't been filming videos where
I've been talking I haven't really had
the chance to talk to you guys in ages I
hope you all had a really amazing
Christmas and New Year's mom was really
nice cuz uh mine was really nice because
I was in New Zealand with my family and
we just did really takes the cool things
I'll leave the links to my blogs down
below if you haven't seen them because
we just did like really fun things which
was which was weird cause it didn't feel
like Christmas because usually on
Christmas you know you stayed home eat
lots of food with the family open that's
the presents but because we were in a
different country it didn't really feel
like Christmas but it was still packs we
were all together yeah it was like
something different for us
my dad is like captain activity so he's
constantly getting us to do lots of
action sort of adventure stuff it's
really funny when I went when I went
bike riding there's a stain of me
falling went mountain biking and there's
a scene of me falling in my blood and my
dad doesn't be here he goes to pick up
the bike and doesn't pick me up and
there's a comment that there's a few
comments they're like oh my god that guy
didn't pick you up and I'm like yeah
tough love if we were taught that if we
fall we can get ourselves back up I
guess taking my top maracuja creaseless
concealer it's in the shade medium
it's a really full-coverage sort of
waterproof concealer it's so amazing
it's my new favorite concealer at the
moment
and I'm just gonna run that under my
eyes just took rice in that area up I'm
looking very tired
and just to even out the brightness all
over my face I'm going to put a little
bit on the center of my forehead down
the bridge of my nose and on my chin
it'll also add just a little little bit
more coverage to those areas as well I
love that we have a Sephora online for
Aziz now because because obviously we
have the Sydney Sephora store which is
easy for me to access but for other
states not so easy that's awesome that
we have an online support store for all
that snow I was looking online and the
online store who sell things like nude
sticks and like a brand called 3ca which
I haven't given a go but I really want
to buy a few of the products and see how
they are because no like I've heard of
them but I've no tried them so any of
you guys have tried any of them let me
know Donna if some of those ago as well
as the call as well as the more known
ones like Anastasio and cat funding and
things like that so i'm now going on
with my Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit I have the kit in medium to date
because I am quite tanned so I need
darker colors and I'm actually gonna use
this shade down here to set my under
eyes because it actually works really
well at brightening up the under eyes
and you definitely want to set that top
concealer because as it is more of a
thick concealer it does crease play
easily so
the same shade and I'm just going to set
my eyelids it's finally I'm going to
take the same shade and just set my
t-zone area just so we don't get Whaley
so moving on I'm gonna use my Kat Von D
shade + light eye palette this palette
is so amazing for just doing really sort
of neutral to matte eye looks so it
doesn't really have any shimmers or
anything but it's really good for
contouring the eyes so what do I want to
do so I'm going to start by going into
this shade at the top here and I'm going
to use it as a transition shade in my
crease
I'm going to round it out so make sure
you're going to know rounded sort of
motion with your brush instead of
winging it out
please zoom in a little bit scary up
close it's now going to take a more
precise brush and I'm gonna go in with
this shade just here such a pretty shade
and I'm gonna run that more directly
into the crease into the socket of your
eyelid so I'm just running that sort of
Maroney shade directly in the eye socket
and then blending it up as I go
with no more product on the brush just
keep blending so now I'm taking a flat
shader brush and the same Moroney
Burgundy ready color and I'm gonna pack
that onto my eyelid
this eye looks amazing for blue eyes
because these ready tones really make
blue eyes pop so for all my blue eyed
girls out there yeah I think this would
really suit you and then go back in with
the blending brush and pick a little bit
more of that shade up and just blend it
into the crease with the lid
and then one last time just take your
big blending brush and the first shade
and just blend it all together
make sure there's no harsh lines
and then just take the same brush and
pick up the red shade and just run that
oh oh my gosh I haven't won I haven't
really been wearing that much makeup
lately so my eyes get so sensitive other
lashes are on I'm going to take my Tarte
Amazonian clay waterproof runs up it's
in the shade Park Avenue princess and
I'm just gonna sort of slightly contour
slash slightly bronze up the skin
because it is quite a contour shade
so to highlight I'm going to use my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter in the
shade opal and put that on all the high
points of my face cheekbones you just
take my finger and I'm gonna put that on
the center of my nose and dump bridge
and just above my eye arch of my eyebrow
I'm also gonna take a brush and I'm just
gonna run that lightly on my brow bone
and on my inner tear ducts just to
brighten those areas up a little bit
alrighty so to do my eyebrows I'm going
to use my Anastasia dip brow pomade in
the shade blonde
and I'm gonna really lightly feather
this product through my brows I'm not
gonna do any harsh defining because my
eyebrows are such a mess
lately I don't even think that's a point
I may as well just look like I'm going
for the messy look instead of trying
make messy brows Nate
now I'm going to take my Marc Jacobs
lipstick in the shade his Kiss Bang Bang
and I'm just gonna run that all over my
lips I have to test a size but it's the
nicest color and I'm just gonna block
that off so it's nice and matte my hair
is a crazy mix it's the makeup look done
I hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
go check out Sephora calm day you too
get any of those products because I
honestly recommend every single one of
those products I used unless you're of
the fairer skin and I would definitely
go for the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit in the lighter one because
it does come with quite dark shades but
yet otherwise I recommend everything
especially this top concealer this is
the best concealer ever used it's
amazing and if you don't live in Sydney
you can't get to the forest or in Sydney
it makes it a lot easier for you guys to
get having some cool products from them
do you know that the shipping is free
for orders over fifty five dollars so
that's pretty cool because I hope
there's nothing worse than when you buy
a bunch of products online and then the
shipping costs an extra like forty bucks
and then you think you could have like a
home on the product for that amount and
and depending where you are they deliver
between two to ten business days so you
don't have to wait that long I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial though and
make sure you leave in the comments
below what you guys want to see from me
next I know I'm gonna do a few look
books and sort of fashion holes on my
channel soon and I'll see you guys in my
next video I hope you're having a lovely
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
