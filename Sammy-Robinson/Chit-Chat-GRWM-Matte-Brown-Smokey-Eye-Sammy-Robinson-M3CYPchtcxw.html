taking my new favorite it's from Urban
Decay The Naked skin concealer and it's
in the shade light warm it's such a
lightweight concealer it's so good
because it's not fit under your under
eyes so it doesn't crease as much I'm
gonna draw that in the triangle
underneath my eye I'm also bringing that
on the inner corner just here because
that's where we tend to get the darkest
just in there it's quite purple and blue
in there and if you want to thin out
your nose you can actually bring that up
onto the sides of your nose just as you
can see it kind of diminishes the side
of your nose and just thins it out a lot
and I'm gonna put a little bit of that
on my chin on my forehead and on the
bridge of my nose tip of my nose just in
all the spots that we highlight and I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender again and
I'm gonna use the tip side and I'm just
gonna blend that out sorry about my dogs
so annoying I like to blend at the
center of my face first and then my eyes
because that way I feel like the
concealer on the eyes has the concealer
on the eyes has more time to just set
and really slow kin to the skin I can't
even tell you enough how good this
concealer is it's just so thin but it's
got such good coverage I like to blend
the sides of my concealer I mean the
edges of my concealer first without
touching the actual bags of my eyes and
then I'll go in and really get in there
also with the excess of the sponge bring
it underneath your nose because that's
where women tend to get
a lot of redness and now just go up and
just blend it all out and bring it
around your lifelines as well so that it
stops that from creasing so the
concealer is all blended out now I'm
going to say it with the translucent
powder i use this starlet translucent
powder it's just yeah it's just a loose
powder and the reason i like to set my
under eyes with a translucent powder is
because it's so finely milled that it's
not going to take up your under eyes
it's just going to nicely set that area
so i put a bit of translucent on my
Beauty Blender but I take the other edge
with nothing on it I blend it out one
more time looking up making sure there's
no fine lines or I hadn't settled into
your wrinkles and then I quickly flip it
and I just set that area so again I'm
going to pick up a bit of powder do the
same on this side and as you can see
there's a bit of excess powder on the
sponge I'm just gonna run that over
every other area just because I don't
want a really powdery cakey face I just
want a set thanks I don't like being
able to see powder on my skin
so I'm using the cover FX contour kit
and it's just the dark shape there's no
light shades in there but I used the
number three I'm just gonna warm up the
pore outer perimeter of my face
my birthday's on the fifth of July so
that's coming up in a few days and um I
know I want to go out for cocktails but
I just don't know where I'm gonna go so
if any of you in Sydney you know of any
good cocktail bars or just really nice
really nice bars with good cocktails
same thing yeah let me know write down
in the comments below cuz I really gonna
try out new things so if you don't have
any groovy little places I'd love I'd
love to know also if you guys were
to see a birthday haul so like what I
got for my birthday kind of thing give
this video a thumbs up because I think
that'll be fun to film but I'm gonna set
those contour shades with my Smashbox
powder it's just one of my darker
powders it'll just ensure that the outer
edges of my face will stay nice and dark
so I'm just gonna take a different
powder brush and I'm just gonna swipe
away the excess translucent powder
underneath my eye so to bronze up my
skin further I'm going to use my glam
bronze by L'Oreal it's just a nice warm
toned bronzer and I'm just gonna take
that on a Coastal Scents
b25 brush so you start on your forehead
you go down to your cheekbones and then
you go down onto your jaw line in a3
formation
visualize a bit of an exciting month for
me because I'm also going to New Zealand
on July the 15th and I'm going skiing
for ten days but unfortunately that
means that I'm not going to be able to
upload any videos during that time so
while I'm in Sydney I'd like to film
heaps of videos and get them up before I
go and then obviously film heat when I
get back so if you guys want to see
anything before I leave let me know down
in the comments below and I'll try and
film as many as I can before I go I'm
also going to just slightly contour the
sides of my nose
when I contour the sides of my nose I
don't really need to straighten up my
nose and I can only small or anything I
just Mordor to add a little bit more
color into the center of my face because
it's really washed out and so you just
bring a bit of structured back into your
nose by doing this then I just poked
myself in the eye with my rash whoops so
I'm going to take a blush by the balm
I'm using the cabana boy blush like this
it's a really nice rosy shade and I'm
just gonna put that on the apples of my
cheeks and blend it just above my
contour
I like to run a little bit of that on
the tip of my nose as well just for a
really nice sunkissed look because when
you go a little bit some but you always
get a little bit red on your nose so it
looks really healthy so I'm gonna use my
Becca highlighter in the shade opal I'm
gonna take that on my fan brush and just
lightly swipe that over my cheekbones
and connect it with my eyebrow
run a little bit down the center of my
nose on the tip of my nose my Cupid's
bow and above my eyebrows now I'm going
to quickly go do my eyebrows off-camera
and I'll be right back I am going to
film an eyebrow tutorial soon so give
this video a thumbs up or comment down
below letting me know if you wanna see
an eyebrow routine and I'll be sure to
get up that up as soon as possible I'll
be right back
so now I'm just gonna move on to my eyes
I'm gonna take my soft ochre Paint Pot
by a Mac and I'm just going to prep my
eyelids and I'm going to be setting that
Paint Pot with my AC on to come to an
highlighting kit because you always want
to set your eye base with a powder
because when it comes to the eyeshadows
you always want to blend powder on top
of powder because blending dark colors
onto a sticky base makes it almost
impossible to blend it out because it's
just stuck on a tacky surface and won't
blend so you want to make sure that you
set your Paint Pot or whatever I base
you use down so I'm gonna go into my Z
palette today I'm going to take the
shade Peach Smoothie which is just a
light sort of peachy color funnily
enough and I'm gonna use that as my
transition shade in my crease
this adds hardly any color to my crease
because I have quite tan skin it just
sets down a nice transition so that the
colors you put on top of it are really
easy to blend I've been watching orange
is the new black lately and I finished
all I just recently finished all three
seasons and I don't even know what to do
with my life now because I'm not much of
a TV watcher I don't watch TV that often
they're for me to have finished three
seasons so quickly it's just random but
now I really want to watch more seasons
so what do you guys recommend is there
any TV shows you guys think I should
definitely watch I've heard Pretty
Little Liars is really good but aren't
there like a hundred seasons I don't
know if I can be bothered to go back to
the very beginning okay let me know what
TV should i watch TVs
what TV shows or seasons or series
should I watch so I'm holding this
because I'm gonna use it
this is creme brulee by makeup cake it's
just not that dark again but it is going
to add a little bit of depth to the
crease the shape of the eyeshadow I'm
using I'm not using what is my words
today the shape of the eyeshadow I'm
going for is a rounded look so I'm not
going to drag anything out or even get
my eyes at all I'm going to go for a
very rounded look around my eye because
the lashes I'm using do I go from short
to long they are from short to long to
short so I'm going to mimic the eye so
in the same shape as the eyelashes so
making it a little bit darker again I'm
going to take frappe from makeup geek
and I'm gonna run that in exactly the
same spots these are all matte
eyeshadows and I'm going to take a mock
up if the darkest Brown from my makeup
geek palette that I have and I'm going
to run that really lightly and directly
in my stop it line so I'm not going to
fade it out into my crease like I have
with the other ones I'm going to keep
this directly in my socket line I'm
making this chitchat everything I've a
tutorial so well I definitely would love
to Vogue my New Zealand trip though so
if you guys want to see a vlog of the
New Zealand trip in the mountains and
the snow and the skiing and things like
that
I would love to film that so let me know
in the comments below as well if you'd
like to see that so now I'm picking up
chickadee and I'm just gonna run that
right above everything just to really
warm up the Browns I'm using Mac's Cooke
all over my eyelid
it's just matte Brown so I'm gonna run
that all over my lid and kind of bring
it up into the socket line as well just
to blend with that dark brown
you know I'm also taking the same color
on my blending brush and I'm going to
blend it through with the brown just so
there's no harsh lines then I'm gonna
take a domed small domed brush this is
the Coastal Scents bs4 brush and I'm
gonna just take a bit of every brown
just like a little bit of random it
Browns and I'm just gonna run that under
my lash line on my inner water line I'm
going to use the NYX jumbo pencil in
milk now I'm going to use a bit of my
Sephora lash stretcher mascara it's a
really great mascara and I'm going to
lightly coat my top lashes to coat my
bottom lashes so the eyes are done now
and I'm just gonna let the lashes dry
I'm now gonna take my Mac lip liner in
the shade saw and I'm just gonna let the
line my lips and now I'm gonna go in
with two nude lip products so I have the
true face melted lipstick and the
hourglass lip gloss I'm gonna start off
with the Too Faced melted lipstick in
melted nude and I'm gonna run that all
over my lips making sure to also run
that over the lip liner just so that
there's no stark line between the liner
and the lipstick this melted lipstick is
so smooth and nice and creamy it's so
nice you should buy it and now I'm going
to go over that liquid lip it's not on
the grid lipstick now I'm going to go
over the Too Faced melted lipstick with
this hourglass lip gloss it's in the
shade child it's so pretty
it adds the most amazing shine to your
lips
so I'm now gonna go in with my L'Oreal
Brown pump up it's the lightest shade
this just lightens up my eyebrows a
little bit because the eyebrow product I
do use is a little bit too dark for me
so it just adds more volume to yours
it adds more volume to your brows and
just lightens my brows up but depending
on what shade you get you can darken
your brows or lighten your brows I keep
doing that do you be careful with how
much you use though because if you use
too much it looks like you have grey
streaks throughout your eyebrows and
it's weird alrighty so to finish the
look off I'm going to take my Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray and I'm
going to bathe myself in it so I look
like a greaseball so that's the end of
the makeup look guys I know it was
nothing new and revolutionary in the
department of makeup looks I thought I
would just do a chitchat get ready with
me so I can update you and a few things
that's coming up and so I can tell you
that I'll be away for 10 days during
July I'm not going to be able to upload
any videos then so I hope you did enjoy
this and maybe you did learn something
from it hopefully at least one of you
give this video a thumbs up if you did
enjoy this chit chat get ready with me
and I'll definitely be sure to do more
because I did enjoy just kind of sitting
back and doing my makeup and having a
bit of a chat with the camera also if
you want to see more videos from me make
sure you subscribe to my channel and if
