barefaced

just go yeah it's okay she goes where we
do what hey to you
blunt what I don't know yeah man
low voice oh my god no you don't you
always think you're Gordon you so don't
I can't stop so I'm starting with the
memory doors prime time primer I'm still
getting my oh my god can you use it so
I'm gonna mix my L'Oreal infallible
foundation the 24 hour matte palette
with my nude oil so it seems out the
foundation because I want a more of a
light coverage and I'm still getting my
eyebrows without guys you should see how
many eyebrow tools are here just for
filling my eyebrows one two three gel
six seven shows seven things that do it
so if you're feeling my eyebrows I'm
using the Anastasio deep breath made and
this is going to take me like half an
hour so I was doing my eyebrows last
time my makeup good tonight we're just
going for drinks so we're going to do a
bit of it nighttime get ready with us
like a whole amount of time as a high
road is dedicated like four months into
I reckon yes Texas I'm just trying to
get really slowly so that writer can do
her eyebrows and I'm gonna be up to the
salesman I have to want sorry that when
I do my makeup is the slowest thing that
never ever possibly happen this is
whoa did you hear that little into 20

for a week because she's getting her
teeth done so I'm sure a lot of you
don't know who I am but a lot of you
Renee is I already did a collab with you
don't know but I didn't have like the
most perfect teeth which Sammy's
obsessive for some reason like I love
her teeth so I don't I mean I think she
should do it if she wants to do it
absolutely but I love people that have
an individual sort of characteristic you
know like yeah I'm dead teeth they're a
bit give them character when they're not
as straight so like I love her teeth but
if it's gonna make her more confidence
you should absolutely go through it and
all happens so passes are like me and
Sammy I'm sure all of you guys know that
we just go out so we were like I'm going
to prom with me
like sometime next year yeah and then I
don't know I just type out like I might
be in Sydney in like three weeks

here I'd always happens though that kind
of thing yeah I reckon it always really
last-minute yeah so I mean when you make
a plan like you want to come too soon

it often doesn't happen because yeah
things in your life change so yeah you
