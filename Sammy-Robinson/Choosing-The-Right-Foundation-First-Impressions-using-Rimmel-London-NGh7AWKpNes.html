the background it's really noisy outside
um is it super windy today so as you can
tell by the title down below today's
video is both a review on foundations
and what foundation suits certain skin
types and also our first impressions
using all Rimmel London products I've
never done a first impressions video
before so if you guys like first
impression videos make sure you give
this video a thumbs up so I know that
you like them and I'll definitely do
lots more so about two weeks ago Rimmel
London sent me four foundations one of
each in their range and for me to try
out and test on my own skin it came at a
perfect timing for me because I had my
wisdom teeth taken out so I had so much
time to play around with makeup and just
sort of test what would work best for me
if you tend to get a little bit oily
around your t-zone has a few breakouts
here and there and you tend to stay
quite dry on the outer perimeter of your
face you tend to have quite normal to
combination skin personally I would
choose to go for something like the
Rimmel London match perfection
foundation this foundation is classified
as sort of a medium coverage foundation
it has a poor blurring effect so if you
do find you get quite um large if you do
have quite large pores or you feel like
foundation seeps into your pores this
foundation is pretty good for you so
this foundation has a 24 hour moisture
consistency and it does have an SPF of
20 in it it's just a great all-round
foundation it doesn't make you too oily
so it's not a Jewish foundation it's not
an extremely matte foundation it gives
you enough coverage it's buildable and
it does have sunscreen in it because
such means important for your skin sorry
my friends for me if you feel like your
skin gets quite tight around your t-zone
after a shower so if you cleanse your
skin and you exfoliate your skin and you
do your normal skincare routine but you
feel your skin gets really tight and
almost a bit stretchy and also if you
feel like you're prone to red patches or
you know dry patches around your nose
around your chin then you have dry skin
I would suggest using the Rimmel London
lasting finish foundation so this
foundation for me is super lightweight
which is great for dry skin because you
don't want anything too thick and cakey
that will cling to your dry patches and
it's really long-lasting so it has a
resistance for up to 25 hours which is
great as well so you'll find your makeup
won't be transferring it won't be
rubbing off it won't be clinging to dry
patches and then rubbing off in other
patches it's supposed to stay quite
consistent over your face over a long
period of time but in this foundation
you will find that there is a comfort
serum which is supposed to sort of keep
your skin really hydrated during the day
because there's nothing worse than
feeling that you have really dry skin
and then putting foundation over the top
of it you feel like it's even drier so
you want a foundation that's quite
moisturizing again this foundation has
an SPF of 20 in it so again that will
keep you more hydrated as well and
protect your skin from sun damage so if
you feel like your skin is not
necessarily dry so you don't get too
many dry patches it's not necessarily
oily you have no excess oil around your
t-zone or anything but you do feel like
your skin is quite gray and dull and you
feel like your skin doesn't have that
much hydration and it laughs a lot and
it lacks a little bit of elasticity then
I would suggest the wake me up
foundation as it suggests by the name
wake me up it really does do that it has
a brightening effect in it
so it keeps your skin looking super
hydrated and it gives you a bit of a
radiant glow to the skin minimizes the
effect of fatigue and just sort of
illuminizer 's and lightens up your skin
and I would say this is definitely a
medium coverage foundation but again
very buildable so if you like me and you
feel like your face gets quite oily
during the day so after about an hour or
two wear of makeup on your skin you feel
like you constantly have oily t-zone and
after you wear your foundation you feel
like you're prone to a lot of breakouts
then you have quite oily skin so for me
I found the foundation that works best
is the stay matte foundation for me the
best thing about the stay matte phone
is that it has a really feather-like
touch to it so it is a mousse formula so
it looks quite thick
but it's not it's as you spread it
around the face it's so easily blendable
and ends up giving you quite a light
texture over the skin so although it
comes out quite thick it looks very
natural and it almost looks like velvet
on your skin it's really nice foundation
I've been using this so much lately and
I really really like it um so obviously
it has a matte finish and it's oil-free
I usually don't even have to put powder
on when I'm wearing this foundation it's
really good for oily skins so I hope you
guys found that somewhat helpful and
let's just go straight into the first
impressions now so I'm starting out with
my Rimmel London at lasting finish
primer so this isn't a first impression
either because I have been testing out
the foundations but today I'll be using
the Rimmel London stay matte foundation
in the shade 400 natural beige I have
tested out this foundation with a Beauty
Blender and a brush but yet I think it
works best for me using a brush and then
I just use my cheap Jessup brush from
ebay so today I'm going to just be
taking small amounts at a time and just
buffing that into my skin so as you can
see I haven't had to use any concealer
on my face and that foundation has
perfectly covered every blemish on my
skin even though the foundation has left
me with quite a matte complexion and I
wouldn't usually need to necessarily set
it I am going to use a powder for the
purpose of this first impressions video
so I'm going to try out this stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder in 0:05
silky beige and I'm going to primarily
just set my t-zone with that
not that you need the powder but oh my
god these two products are a match made
in heaven my skin has never looked so
soft I don't know if you guys can tell
it literally just feels like velvet and
now I'm going to be trying out the
Rimmel London and natural bronzer it's a
waterproof bronzing powder with SPF 15
in it I don't know if the SPF is
necessary in a bronzer but let's give it
a go and I'm using it in the shade 0 to
2 Sun bronze it's really buildable so
it's not
to pigmented which is good I hate
products at a tooth pigment - you put on
your face and it's just like oh
because then you have to like blend out
and figure out how to get rid of it so
that's really good put it a bit on the
sides of my nose as well just to bring
some warmth into the center of my face
so now I'm going to try out the Rimmel
London lasting finish soft color blush
in 150 live pink I tend to steer clear
of light pink shades on my cheeks I like
to go with a deeper deeper toned blush
or more of a bronzey blush we'll give it
a go see how it looks again it's not to
be minted from the get-go so you can
build along that adds the nicest sheen
to your cheeks
yeah gives you like a really healthy
glow love it
now for my highlight I didn't I don't
have a highlight umm shade so I'm going
to use the Rimmel London eyeshadow in
0:01 net gold record that's nice I
really like that drove my nose cupids
ooh eyebrow bone and my inner tear ducts
so now I'm taking a little bit more of
the bronzer on my Sigma large fluffy
blending brush whatever it's called
about that long when it's all rubbed off
I'm going to put it in my crease just to
give myself a transition shade
I'm going to take the magnifies
eyeshadow in 0:03 all about that base
this is a little bit more of a topi
shade and I'm just going to run that on
my outer corner just to deepen up the
eye look a little bit so I'm going to
pick up the eyeshadow gold record
against on my finger and a pack that
onto my eyelid
that's pigmented and I'm going to run
that on my lower lash line
so now I'm going to be training out the
Rimmel London lash accelerator endless
mascara oh yes it has a nice thin wand
that's my favorite kind of mascara wand
so what I like about this mascara is
that it doesn't dispose of too much
product at one time you know when you
open some mascara is the one can be so
wet that one swipe of the mascara
already immediately makes your eyelashes
quite clumpy um sorry I'm like moving
around
well this one's quite good because it
doesn't have too much product on it to
begin with so you can build it up
without getting too clumpy immediately
if you know what I'm saying yeah I
really like this mascara I have major
issues with making my eyelashes really
clumpy to begin with so the fact that it
doesn't really allow too much product to
come off at once is great for people
like me who struggle with clumpy lashes
so now I'm going to try an eyebrow gel
I'm not sure whether to go with clear or
the color I might try the color and if
it's too dark I'll go to the clear one
so I'm using the brow this way um brow
gel in medium brown oh my god I like it
I find with brow gels often for me
they're either too blond so they make my
eyebrows look quite grey or like white
or they're too dark and they make my
eyebrows like black it actually gives me
the perfect brown shade for my eyebrows
so I have two shades of the pravakar
lips um sort of liquid lipsticks here
I'm going to start with the provocative
16-hour lip color in 7:30 make your move
and then I'm probably a little bit of
this one on top a lot of lipsticks can
live with liquid lips can be quite thick
and muddy very clean
it's a really nice color then going to
add a little bit of 700 skinny-dipping
over the top of that oh okay very
different
yeah that's a nice color they lick the
lipsticks quite sticky I don't know if
mine's just not dried properly yet but
um yeah there's quite sticky so that's
all the makeup for today oh gosh have
you guys Nabal to hear that wind in the
background this whole time it's so windy
today so I apologize if you've heard the
trees in the background Oh God so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and if
