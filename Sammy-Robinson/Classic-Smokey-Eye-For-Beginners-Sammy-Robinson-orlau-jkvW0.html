smoky eye I'm prepping my eye with my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot it's really
important to have some sort of base when
you're doing a smoky eye because you're
basically just blending the whole entire
time so you need to make sure you've got
a sustainable base for that blending on
top of it so to ensure that the powders
blend easily on top of the Paint Pot I'm
just putting down the banana powder from
the ACM tour highlighting kit and I'm
just then going into my makeup geek
palette and I'm picking up Peach
Smoothie and just running that through
my crease as my transition shade it
doesn't create much color but it will
just also ensure that everything blends
easily on top of it
so with this smokey eye I am picking up
a lot of colors and just gradually
getting darker and darker as I go
because I have hooded eyelids it's much
harder to blend out colors in your
crease if they're really really dark so
if you're like me and you have hooded
eyelids or even if you don't have good
eyelids it's just a really good
suggestion just to go darker and darker
as you're going and be really gradual
and make sure everything's blended
really well I'll make sure I list
everything down below in the order that
I used to them because I don't know the
names of the top of my head but yeah so
just picking that color all these colors
that I've used so far on the same brush
and just running them messily through my
crease just to smoke out that crease and
gradually make it darker
so the darker you go with the color the
more you'll need to blend it so with
this eye look you need to make sure you
leave yourself time to just really go in
and blend every color out seamlessly
because the darker you go the more
unforgiving the color becomes and it
becomes harder to actually blend it out
so the colors underneath it need to be
blended really well
so taking this dark brown on a smaller
brush now I'm now becoming more precise
with the placement of my shadows so I'm
putting that more towards the socket
line right in the crease and I'm just
mainly putting that on the outer corner
just to deepen the outer corner for now
so after that I'll be picking up a
shader brush and just packing that on
the lid as well just to deepen the lid
color before we put the black on
even though I didn't show it between
every step I've been picking up my big
fluffy blending brush and just blending
everything out as well so now I'm
picking up the black from my stellar
palette and I'm running that on my outer
fauna just placing it down with this
small brush and then I'll blend it out
afterwards with I think it's frappe from
the makeup geek palette yeah frappe so
I'll just blend that out with that shade
and just make sure that black is
diffused as well
then I'm just gonna pack that black onto
the lid
so don't pack it above your crease or
above your lid and make sure you place
it just up towards the crease the line
where your lid ends or even just below
that would be here but don't go above it
because that makes blending really hard
so once I've packed the color on I'm
gonna go into this darker brown and I'm
gonna just keep picking that Brown up
and I'm just gonna keep running it
through the crease to diffuse the black
just blend and blend and blend and blend
so now I'm picking up the shade
chickadee and I'm just placing that
above all the shades we've put down just
to warm up the eye look and create a
gradient above all the darker colors I
always like to make gradients within my
eye looks just because it makes
everything look like it is blended out
really well so we just make you I
especially I like to make sure I have
two lighter colors above it just so that
it's all blended nice so I just packed
the black on and then went back into the
brown and blended it out a few times
until it was black enough and intense
enough on me and then I picked up this
dark black liner and I tight lined my
waterline and my line and I also aligned
the top of my lashes just to darken that
area as well
now when you're doing a smoky eye it's
really important to make sure your black
your blase your base is quite flawless
because otherwise you'll just look like
you've been punched in the face
so I already did my foundation and now
I'm going in with a concealer and making
sure I really cover up my dark circles
so that there's no blue or purple
undertones in there so it doesn't look
like I've been punched in the face
then I'm taking up my AC on to a
contouring highlighting kit and using
the banana shade just to set all those
highlight areas and using the Sigma
tapered kabuki brush to do that and now
I'm taking the same brush that we packed
on our lid and using the black just to
go underneath our water line and really
intensify the black on our lower lash
line and then I'm picking up these two
warm shades and I'm running that
underneath the black just just smoke out
the bottom lash line and make the top of
our eye match the bottom then I'm just
picking up a matte white and I'm putting
that on my brow bone and just cleaning
up that top section and putting it on my
water that's it tear ducts and then I'm
just taking my mascara and some falsies
and I'm just putting them off on off
camera these are the iconic spy house of
lashes and then I'll also be doing my
bottom lashes as well and that completes
the eye look I hope you guys have
enjoyed and learned something from this
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
