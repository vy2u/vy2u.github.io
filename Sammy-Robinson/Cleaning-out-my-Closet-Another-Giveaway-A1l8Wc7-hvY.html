Chun here I'm just writing in my
diary trying to figure out what the heck
is going on in my life because I'm going
to barley in about a week and a half I'm
looking crazy as well because I've just
been to Pilates this morning
KX Pilates my second home I've even
started doing some yoga which is like
sort of warm yoga
it's called vinyasa flow and it's not
hot but you get really sweaty because
it's really really warm in the room I'm
going to be doing I'm gonna be filming a
video of sort of new first impressions
for you guys or new products that I've
been loving type video because I got
sent a whole bunch of Mike Jacobs new
eye palettes and some glam glow staff
and some Charlotte Tilbury stuff my
eyelashes have all pretty much fallen
out which I know I wanted but then I'm
thinking like do I want to get them one
last time for Bali so I don't know cuz I
mean I look like a mole rat because when
you're all I wish is fall out you're
left with pretty short stubby lashes and
I kind of don't want that in Bali but
I'm gonna see Korea this Thursday I've
got a facebook live with Maybelline this
Thursday everything down in my diary
that needs to be done and I've found
sort of a day to get everything done so
it won't be too bad but I hope I do
everything before I leave for Bali so
that I don't feel stress I'm still
undecided as to whether I'm gonna vlog I
know it would be such a nice cool vlog
to do but uh yeah I'm not sure I really
feel like I just want to have a break
but I guess this vlog to be honest I
just picked up my camera not knowing
what I was gonna say to you guys cuz
jumpers by Tommy Hilfiger yes I want to
get new earrings for my piercings I need
to get some new bikinis for Bali when I
get home I'm gonna do a what I packed
for Bali so the clothes that I brought
the bikinis and stuff and then my makeup
bag just especially to somewhere like
Bali I don't bring that much I won't
bring that much so I guess I'll show you
my essentials my absolute essentials
we're about to go fill my Maybelline
trying out their brow touch do you think
it's a brow tint that lasts like three
days and
and I've been growing these bad boys out
so it'll be interesting to see if they
tempt my bushy ass brows that'll
probably be up on my plate as well so if
you guys want to check that out you can
this is my little avos snack I've got
some strawberries with some yogurt and
chia seeds and I'm having a kombucha as
well how do I look
I got my eyebrows tattooed on I just
thought it was about time it was
everyone was doing it the trend is hot
live while you're young you know so I
also got a little bit darker than usual
wow that lasts three days so if this
fails for three days I'm gonna have
black eyebrows or really big dark
eyebrows I decided to go with grey Brown
light gray or gray something because I
know the other ones leaned warmer toned
and I don't see what turned it all say
this could either end out okay or it
could end up like a total disaster
I am so impressed
that's after I've pulled it off but it
like it's amazing you can't see it's
just hinted the brows I've got nothing
in my eyebrows my god that's awesome Wow
not that I didn't have high hopes of the
product I just wasn't really sure what
to expect I guess and I'm so impressed
so here is our last giveaway that I
posted I'm going to draw the winner now
so let's here see how this works so you
can have one winner
about 14,000 so 15,000 people wow that's
crazy let's draw it whoa Lauren Wormley
Wormald
who said congratulations to Lauren I'm
just emailing you now that was actually
so much easier than I thought so all I
had to do was press press the winner and
then it just does it automatically and
finds it like shuffles through all of
them she was entry number 10,000 312 so
that's so crazy
how exciting so I'm gonna do my next
giveaway really soon I'm gonna probably
do it in this vlog
yeah I'm gonna do it in this vlog Bryce
need to put together a bunch of products
and I'll let you guys know what the next
one is I'm just been chilly as we can be
editing and I got a delivery come to my
front door so I thought I'd show you
guys it's so funny
this place man must think that I just am
the worst online shopper like he comes
to my toilet every three days he's like
hey hey you got eggs eggs likes and like
three packages of time did I asked like
I swear I'm not addicted to online
shopping and he was just like mm-hmm
like come on
that is so next level there's all of
these white thoughts be taken and all of
this is princess Polly so if they did
big orders from both of them and doing a
whole with boutique when I get back from
Bali and entered a big princess probably
one or two because if this stuff that I
want to bring to Bali and then for
princess Polly I think I'm gonna do a
what I packed for Bali and do my makeup
and a few cute outfits like make it
completely different video so so I'm
currently just wrapping up my giveaway
winners prezi's I'm not very good at
this
decor type decoration packing stuff so
let's see how I go
best layer I've just put in some pink
tissue paper yeah well there was no no
nice way of packing it all in because it
was so bulky so I've had to just sort of
chuck it all in and then I think I'm
gonna put this on top last touch is to
leave her a little note he that way to
go to the post office post this pick up
one of my parcels that are apparently
living at the post office getting here
some messages and I'm gonna go get
myself some lunch hungry then I'm gonna
go home because I've got a lot of
cleaning to do like it's disgusting
rooster I need help I didn't hit health
but um that's what I'm gonna try and get
done for the rest of the day and then I
might pre record a video like a makeup
the first impressions video for when I
go to Bali but it
I'm gonna got myself this salad from
bonbon salads and oh my god it's so
yummy it's green tea noodles salad
chicken teriyaki flavored oh yeah I am
in for one hell of a day
let's do this grass shots we're getting
now we're getting there
I've gone through all of those drawers
that are closed they're done you need to
go through the ones that are open fold
with everything in those and gotten rid
of heaps and these and then just put
these clothes away these are the clothes
I just opened from the hall this morning
so I need to find a place for those as
well this is all the clothes and I'm
gonna be giving away so far I haven't
even finished yet okay so that is all
the rubbish this is all the cards
scattered all over here the reason it is
a mess is because my sisters went
through it to take anything that they
wanted before I donate it all excuse me
you do realize I'm gonna have to wash
all that now I was probably gonna do a
massive load of washing and you make
soap kind of put all over ya I'm really
unsure as to whether I should keep some
of the clothes off and salad on de Pape
and then donate that money to charity or
whether I should just donate all the
clothes it'll take a lot of time to do
the D pop thing but maybe I should do
both in that way I can donate a bit of
money as well hmm
and decided I'll do that after Bartley
though so apart from these this stuff
here cuz obviously I have to film a hole
with this stuff and also take it Diwali
I finished the floor and the closer is
nice and coldly you know just need to
sweep the floor but all my drawers fit
just so exciting in all my shelves and
nice and neat and I've just gotten rid
of a lot of stuff for my hangers so
feeling good how's your living space you
sitting next to my basketball jerseys is
it much nicer now
it's not so hectic in here is it yeah
