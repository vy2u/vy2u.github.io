while I went to a few clothes shops I
got this general health hat it's from
rhythm I was wearing it in in an
Instagram photo and in my vlog and a few
people asked where I got this wrong so
this hat is from general pants also from
general Panzers about these these
striping pants I'll insert clips of me
wearing this stuff so I can't don't have
to show you now that these are just so
comfortable and so soft and just amazing
like it seems like a cheaper version of
the basic pants so if you know we're
kind of like because they kind of
bootcut REE ish what yeah they kind of
poop catcher ish paths so if you guys
know basic then they're like that's it
if you don't want to buy it that
expensive I think these were like 80
bucks so they're like it's 30 bucks
cheaper than the basic ones and they are
so comfortable also I got from general
pants this jumpsuit throwing this in my
blog as well and in an Instagram photo
again and it's just this gray jumpsuits
got shorts and a turtleneck top and it's
backless so it's got that at the back
which is so cute I love so next I went
to sports girl I was just having a look
around not thinking I was gonna buy
anything but I went into the sales
section and this they had a 50% off
already discounted products so this was
$24 down to 40 95 plus it's in off 4095
so this was like seven bucks or so ever
it was so I just like bees in the way
so why I bought it to be honest but it
can come in handy it'll come in handy
hopefully just because I like minis and
it was so cheap so I thought just why
not
so as well from Sportsgirl I've got this
big jumper
it's just humongous it's I can't show
you in the camera but I'll inside
quick it's a turtleneck jumper which
will just be really nice for winter and
I love turtlenecks
so you served your purpose go back to
your pile of clothes next I went to that
with little random marketing area down
the bottom of my syllable in Sydney and
they had a little market store called
get rocked and I bought a few things
from there so I got this kind of cocky
greenish cardigan which is mid-length so
it's not too long but it's not too sure
because I don't really like short
cardigans I like cardigans with a bit of
length so I got this which was nice and
really comfy for the winter I also got
this vest so I'm just over a junior oh
and everything has a cute really really
soft nice very um hold and inside so it
keeps nice and warm I then got this
jumper which I love it's just so handy
to wear when you just check on them have
jeans or whatever chucking a bit yeah
just a pair of jeans or pants or
whatever and you just need to have a
jumper to throw over it so I got this
jumper which is so comfortable that's
just just a nice big jump up just to
chuck over whatever you're wearing
really like it's just got it's got
really nice I really like the color but
it's got a bit look a bit of black and
grey and white kind of throughout it
it's just speckled it's just cool
well like it the next top I got was this
it's like a meet your top on this so
ends there and there has slits down the
sides and so it's just like a really
long kind of Cape at the front and the
back of your outfit and then the next
singer that I bought the last thing they
bought my finally their what how am I
gonna edit this finally the last thing
that I bought from the same store down
the bottom of Westfield was this pair of
jeans it's just got a few rips not too
many so it's not confronting and it has
kind of like it's tied tight bit down
the bottom just kind of a pair of Chino
pants I like them they're so comfortable
they kind of stretchy kind of baggy kind
of tight kind of a bit of everything so
they're super comfortable and then go
with like everything you can check them
on under a big coat I've been jumper a
t-shirt wear them with like sand white
converse and sandals dress it up with
some AC like stiletto heels they're just
like a really nice pair of jeans I'm
like I love the color of them as well
and I like how they go tight at the
bottom because I don't know I just like
it so yeah that is the end of my whole I
