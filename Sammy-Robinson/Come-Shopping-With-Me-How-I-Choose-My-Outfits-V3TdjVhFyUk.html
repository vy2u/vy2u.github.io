just been switching around my flat
trying to find different places to fill
because my makeup area is still an
absolute mess so we're just sitting on
my desk today and I'll just be chatting
to you guys from here so today's video
is a little bit of a spin off of one of
my haul videos and it's going to include
outfit and I'll show you guys outfits
but the difference is instead of having
lots of different clothes I'll just be
showing you two different outfits so
MasterCard has kindly sponsored me in
this video which is like incredible I
would have dreamed to be working with
such an amazing iconic company I just
wanted to tell you guys sort of how
MasterCard works and why it is so
amazing when shopping online I get
constant questions from you guys asking
me where I find my inspiration where I
shop online how I choose my outfits so
for today's video I thought I would show
you guys a step-by-step process of how I
do choose my outfits and then at the end
of the video I will try them on so when
I receive the packages I'll try them on
for you guys and I'll see if I
successfully made an outfit so to begin
obviously I'll have something that I'm
shopping for so for example I might have
an event that I have to attend maybe a
festival or a party Oh for the purpose
of today's video I'm going to say that
one outfit is going to be for an event
so say I'm just going to a neckl launch
party you want to feel you want to be a
little bit dressy but not to make a
dress and for the second outfit I'll say
that I'm going to a festival you may
already have an idea of what I want to
dress like so I might be all black with
gold shoes or I might be all white and
have accents of black I generally stick
to black white beige tan gray those
colors the neutral colors because that
way I find it easier to style things
together so if I have a whole heap of
things in my wardrobe that are neutral
colors that means it's easier to mix and
match different items in your closet so
once I have the event that I know I'm
going to and a vision in mind of how I
want to dress
and then choose an online store
depending on those factors a few other
online stores that I'll list for you
guys that I do go to so nasty Yelp
misguided a sauce if you live in
Australia and you want overnight
shipping so so you have an event that
came up really last-minute and you don't
have an outfit for it you could go on
the iconic so for today's video for
outfit one I'm going to be going with
white box boutique and for outfit too
I'll be going with princess Polly so I
often died by every single component of
an outfit when I'm online shopping
actually I usually just go on find one
thing and maybe mix and match the things
that I already own in my closet but for
the purpose of today's video I will buy
one of each component of an outfit
create a whole entire outfit for you
guys because glasses bag belt top pant
skirt whatever it's going to be shoes
everything hello Bambi okay so for
outfit one which is the event I've
decided to go with an all-black ensemble
as I find black is very edgy but I've
decided to make it a little bit girly
and add a skirt into it and then I'm
gonna add accents of browns so I'll show
you guys my cart now and what items I've
chosen some Brown heels I got some
oversized glasses few gold rings a
ribbed crop black singlet a little black
miniskirt a black belts and a black bag
so if outfit number two which is the
festival look we're going to jump on
princess Polly so let Lee I've been
really obsessed with the look of double
denim so in this outfit I really wanted
to incorporate two components of denim
and sort of achieve a boyfriend style
outfit for the festival it's just gonna
be like a baggy loose comfy boyfriend
style I woke up the next day at my
boyfriend's house and chucked his top
and clothes on type of outfit the shoes
that I wanted to go with the outfit was
actually a pair of white sneakers but
they were sold out though so let's say I
know that you probably can't work back
in stocks to a festival because it's
open-toed but for the purpose of this
video that was what was in stock so
let's just say you can wear back in
stocks a pair
denim shorts a Wrangler muscle tee
another denim jacket and oversized denim
jacket a little delicate choker Browne
belts and a pair of small round glasses
so now that all the items are in the
cart and it's time to check out I'm
going to show you the method of payment
that I use when I shop online I just
wanted to tell you guys sort of how
MasterCard works and why it is so
amazing when shopping online a
MasterCard protects you against any
unauthorized transactions which for me
is amazing because obviously I do do a
lot of online shopping if it does happen
to happen to it so if it does happen to
happen to you does happen to happen to
you if it does happen to you and you get
your details swiped
just contact your local bank of those
unauthorized transactions and they will
have your color to go with mastercards a
great way to make sure your money stays
safe as well is to also make sure that
the place you're shopping online does
allow you to have refunds because quite
often a lot of the things that you're
buy online might not fit might not look
as if it did online Oh having the
reassurance of the refund policy on a
lot of the websites will just make sure
that you don't lose your money because
it's easy you just to return the product
if you don't want it and get your money
back instead of risking buying something
that potentially may not fit you and
then you just look you just lost all
that money on it so yes now that I've
checked out and bought those items I'm
gonna head off further but I will talk
to you guys when I do get those items
when they arrive and we will try them on
and see how they went so talk to you
guys soon hey guys so who's just in the
middle of filming and my packages have
arrived I thought I was going to go the
post office and pick them up but um they
actually got left at my door so I'll
show you guys the packages and we'll try
on the outfit see if it all fits
and whether I successfully made an
outfit and whether it all looks good
together
see ya I'll show you guys now whitefox
boutique ones on top and this is the
princess Polly package
first up we got the Bellini heels oh my
god there's so much nicer in real life
there's such a good color so next we
have the bag then we got the sunglasses
and lead hand choke ups the skirt really
nicely fits but then it has a little bit
of a flare so that's very flattering the
belt is awesome the top is ribbed and
nicely fitted and the bag complements
the belt really nicely
who's my messy room in the background so
I love the glasses I think they make the
outfit look really funky the thing that
I can say is that I definitely didn't
need the choker this was already high
necked enough so I think that's a little
bit too much otherwise I love how the
outfit turned out I think it's a really
nice little simple black outfit that
would be perfect for lots of different
occasions it but in saying that I know
that I would wear this choker with lots
of different outfits so so all-in-all
this order was a success and I would
wear all these components with different
outfits for sure if not together these
are the rings as well I love the look of
having different jagged rings all over
your fingers I think it's really quite
edgy so it helps really nicely fitted
the skirts very flattering how it comes
in tight at the waist and then players a
little bit of all of these shoes and
black before so I knew that when I
ordered them again but I would fit them
and that they would be perfect yeah
let's try on outfit number two can't
remember what that is
the belts shorts top and jacket and the
shoes so I absolutely love how every
component of this outfit came together
so we've got the denim shorts which fit
perfectly I rolled them up a little bit
on the sides just to give that frayed
look the Birkenstocks and we've got the
big denim jacket over my shoulders belt
is awesome with it adding a touch of
brown goes really well with denim I find
our belt then matches it matches the
brown Birkenstocks so I absolutely love
these glasses
I usually don't fit sort of round little
glasses they look really silly on my
face but I think these are perfect size
my face theirs they're being so messy
back there and then I absolutely love
this little delicate piece of jewelry it
goes really well with an
I love chokers and sometimes strikers
can be a little bit too overwhelming so
I love how this looks it's really
delicate on the neck so like I said for
this princess Polly haul I'd be wearing
this sort of to maybe a festival or a
picnic hang on
hello come in how are you oh yeah come
say hello come say hello this is my
little Henry boy I've missed you so
these are the types of outfits that I
bought components that I knew that I
would really wear so for example these
don't shorts that I have on now I know
for sure that I will wear them with so
many different outfits I hope you guys
have enjoyed this style video I love
doing it I've been loving doing these
halls as you guys have known but I
thought this is a different way of
incorporating how I shop online and
showing you guys sort of how I choose my
items so yeah I just want to say thank
you so much to MasterCard for working
with me on this video I had said oh do
you might I had so much fun filming it
and I stopped it okay so there's a cat
back there a dog I think my cats are
about to have a fight anyway I have a
discount code for princess Polly if you
guys would like to check that out it's
down in the description I believe I have
one for whitefox boutique so I'll leave
that down below as well yeah so I hope
you guys have a lovely day and I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
