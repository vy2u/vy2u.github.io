got some feature chips and popcorn a few
muesli bars and quest bars I've got all
my toiletries hand bag laptop diary
itinerary and everything in here charges
this is everything packed up so I'm
about ready Oh getting excited I think
first I'm back on my old camera because
this happen that there was a lot of wind
noises on my other camera for being
honest I prefer the other camera a lot
more but I don't want you guys to be
annoyed when watching my blog so I've
just switched to this one for the time
being and then I'll might sort out
another solution there may be another
camera you guys would have an intro as
to like my pre-flight essentials and
stuff because as you know I'm going to
st. repay and I'm going with Clarence
brand and so we are spending a few days
in Finch pay at a beautiful hotel it's
gonna be such an amazing time I'm so
excited in order to get there it
requires about 30 hours or more travel
for me I go from Sydney to Dubai I have
a stopover in Dubai for eight hours and
then I go from Dubai to nice and then I
go from nice into San Tropez so it's
gonna be a lot of traveling so I've been
trying to make sure I keep really
hydrated
I've had a kombucha this morning to give
my gut a little bit of love I'm also
about to go do a super elixir shot which
I'll show you guys as well
again just staying super super hydrated
is super key for me and obviously in
this I've put my antioxidant and my
collagen serum by the beauty chefs I've
tried to actually not sleep that much
like go to bed kind of late last night
and definitely wake up early because I I
want to be able to sleep on the plane
I've got a lot of traveling in a lot of
hours that I'll be on a plane and I
would preferably like to sleep so I'm
pretty tired which is a good thing I
woke up this morning Oh liner I woke up
this morning and went to the gym so I
did a half hour session just a bit of
cardio bit of weights I'm about to jump
in the shower as well I'm gonna just
give my body a good clean and I'll love
in my body of moisturizer because my
skin goes very dry on the plane show you
guys my carry-on essentials I showed you
guys that have a brief look into my bag
before but yeah I'll show you what skin
care and stuff I'll be taking and yeah
what else give giving Bambi lots of love
before I leave because she always does
she always does get very confused right
like oh I'm going to pick up in about 40
minutes so I've still got about 40
minutes to kill a packed prepared
everything just need to have a big
shower get really fresh make sure my
passport and everything is together and
then we'll be heading off my nails don't
like Oh cute and tiny they are they're
obviously very very very very trashed
and it's my SNF still so I didn't want
us to get an S on its do it nice little
baby pink color okay so I am gonna take
one of my probiotics I'm gonna do a shot
of this super elixir which you can find
at Sephora and then I'm gonna add a
whole heap of tumeric into there as well
that's the one thing for me I find my
travel as much as I try not to eat junk
food like burgers and things I just when
I'm traveling alone
I need the comfort yeah so I just try to
load up on my vitamins and stuff before
I go because I know that I'm probably
gonna be pretty bad in the airport I
just get really hungry I don't know if
any of you guys are the same I get
extremely hungry in airports extremely
hungry in planes that's why I've tried
to pack a whole bunch of muesli bars and
popcorn and stuff so that I can snack on
that
for your Nexus in flight departure and
follow the red connection sciences for
the security checkpoint in head upstairs
if your next flight is at a different
clock course you'll then need to take a
short journey on this a night train to
your gate and simply follow the science
to your concourse for us one of the
Qantas Orion restaurant staff or
directions this a bit cold I put my
leather jacket on
but I am now in the Dubai Airport it is
2:40 a.m. I landed at 12 a.m. I've got
another sort of six hours until my
flight so I just got some food that's in
food I had some hummus with promise of
bread a protein bar and my beetroot
chips such as such a random combination
I feel very confused very lucky that I'm
allowed to be in the business lounge and
business business which is such a luxury
thank God though because having an
eight-hour stopover by himself
in a beautiful way you're not really
sure where everything is and things like
that it's quite nice to be able to just
find a corner and sit here and hide yes
I reckon about almost I think I might
even just do it now I'm probably just
gonna head into the bathroom and he's my
carry on skincare skin my face whatever
washing I put some moisturizer on I just
I feel that good you know you don't feel
like fresh also we're several myself a
jumper I Brothers leather jacket and I'm
sitting here in like PJs I've checked
other day so right now I'm just in the
bathroom and you bye and I'm just gonna
go through my cluttery bag and just push
myself up a little bit so clowns gave us
a little playing kit for us to take so
I've just got this one step gentle
exfoliating cleanser to cleanse my face
with this
now men use a little bit of both of
these drunk elephant products that
exceed a serum and the B hydro intensive
hydration gel so when they get on the
plane I'm going to use this clinic
moisture search overnight mask and I'll
just keep that on while I'm sleeping but
for now I'm just gonna use the moisture
surge just normalized rise up comics
let's take my pillow and then this equal
beauty of face mist it's just got a poet
it's called polar screen so just this X
great against pollution which is like
airports and planes so I found a little
lounge area that I can have a lie-down
with the blanket and there's no one
around judging on my phone and having a
chat with people at home because that
time it's like 10:00 a.m. so it's kind
of good that I'm staying awake so that I
can sleep on my next flight but the next
slide is 8 a.m. yes I think it might be
a bit weird if I like put my bed down
and I was slight I'm gonna do it but I
guess

astonishment integers and 22 degrees
Celsius Elsa karakasa
as refer to the counter death metal
sentimental especially Pleasant one
I'm ready
but I would do a quick room tour
standard room tour well I arrived and 20
guys Hubble so as we walk can you see
this beautiful big shower and the
bathroom in the basin and everything and
that was big round bed which I just
wonderful asleep in so badly right now I
walk out here onto the balcony and you
got a view of the hotel beautiful
morning guys sorry I didn't vlog last
night ending I honestly I got to my
hotel room had a nap went to the facial
and I woke up to them calling my room
telling me I had the facial and then I
came back and fell straight asleep I
didn't think I was that tired like I
thought I was kind of okay but no I was
exhausted so I have worked up this
morning at 4:00 a.m. I tried to go back
to sleep but I just know it wasn't that
one so I've just been doing a few emails
and talking to Nicole and people from
home because it's like 3 p.m. there or
something but it's now about almost 7
I've been waiting for the time that I
can all have breakfast I've been so
hungry had two measly bars but it's so
dark here like it's 7 a.m. I'll show you
its back outside how crazy is that it's
like this guy starting to go a little
bit of a light blue but not really like
it's it's really dark the only thing
that's lit up is just like the hotel so
I just went for some brekkie downstairs
and now I'm gonna go into the gym and do
a bit of a workout I just have been
sitting down for so long like a hundred
days I just want to move my body a
little bit
Wow
I didn't realize how much like a plane
and just eating constant food I'm just
being really tired would make me
fatigued like I'm so sweaty
and all I did was like 25 minutes on the
treadmill but I feel much better for
that just having a sweat and getting out
of my system now I'm gonna go down into
the sauna and they're not probably good
for a swim
I won't bring us to this one because
it's too hot in there and probably break
but if I go up to the pool I'll bring
you along a major regrets not bringing
you guys to that spa sort of place
because the hell is so beautiful but I
think I've decided what I'm gonna do is
I have a feeling this vlog is already
really long I was editing a bit at the
airport and I'm pretty sure just the
airport alone got to like seven minutes
so so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to end this vlog here and then I'm
going to start another vlog of my trip
in San Tropez because that way it's not
too long and you guys don't get bored so
I'm going to begin today in another vlog
so if you guys want to see what I get up
to and all the beautiful places that st.
you pay then definitely keep an eye out
from the next video and there's so many
cool like cool things in the hotel alone
let alone all the activities I'm going
to be doing with Clarence
so yeah I'm King so thank you guys for
watching this luck I hope that you guys
have enjoyed and I'll see you in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
