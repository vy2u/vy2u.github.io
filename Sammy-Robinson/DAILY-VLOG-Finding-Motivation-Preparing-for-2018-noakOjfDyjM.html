day and I'm actually just about to head
home to my parents house to film another
Maybelline video my makeup laughs is
still at their house so every time I
film for them I'll just head home and I
thought well I have this camera there's
big camera my dad would just lock my day
as I'm going as well as so I actually
just did my first personal training
session with Flo athletic and he killed
me we did a lot of arm exercises so if
he's just shaking right now I apologize
but my arms are a bit weak right now so
yeah that was really good I asked him as
well if I could bring my camera in and
do a few sessions so that I can show you
guys the workouts that I do and he said
yes which is great so hopefully I'll be
able to film a lot more what exercises
I'm doing and how to tone up and ask him
like sort of a bunch of questions that I
can tell you guys the information is
coming from the expert which is cool so
I actually just made myself a smoothie
Bowl and I didn't film it because I
didn't think I would vlog today but um
I've just decided I'm going to yes I
will bring you guys along today and
we'll see what we got you been wearing
this top so often I gotta try it
so supportive and the quality is just
incredible say white folks I've seen a
few guys have been me about it I
definitely recommend it
hey guys so I've just finished filming
my color correcting video and it
actually it was really fun to play
around with these color correctors it
was really fun to see how they worked on
my skin and I actually really like how
it turned out so this video will be up
on Maybelline's channel soon if you guys
want to check it out but right now I'm
drawing over the top of what I've just
done cuz I'm gonna take a thumbnail
alright and I really don't think it's
supposed to do this with color
correcting you're supposed to use like
teeny tiny amounts of it but whatever
use some blue as my contour is oh my god
I can't take myself seriously this looks
insane be right back I'm gonna take my
thumbnail take this off and then I'll
Chachi is the post-production I tend my
ring light off turn this off all the
makeup off the floor
yes I started saying this next few weeks
so I guess this week is just gonna be
dedicated to like reorganizing getting
myself back in the swing of things
my my house right now is like a massive
pigsty just because I was going out soft
and all my clothes on the floor makeup
is everywhere like I don't have a system
going so I'm gonna reorganize my whole
office chuck everything that I don't
need and have like a fresh start for
2018 so that I don't feel cluttered
already in the new year I just want to
be like completely completely on top of
it and yeah get back into filming for
you guys get back into doing probably
one to two vlogs a week and then a few
sit-down videos here and there a lot
more fitness now that I've talked to
then I'm gonna do a lot more sort of
like what I do in the gym and I want to
do more cooking videos because Joe
Nick's mom gave me the course
Jaimee all of the book which it just
includes five like items within a recipe
so like only you only need five
things and you can create a yummy yummy
meal so I think I'll cook like a bunch
of those for you guys I mean I do love
my really chilled up vlogs that's
probably what I prefer to watch on
YouTube out of anything like I
personally love watching people do
nothing and just like chill and sit and
chat and like show me around the house
and Jimmy you know what they eating and
stuff like that's what I love to watch
so I kinda want to do what I prefer on
YouTube but in saying that obviously I
want you guys to enjoy my content as
well and so I want it to keep it fresh
and keep it yeah Cuba consistent with
what you guys want and what you guys are
asking for I'm loving it I like to be
honest I've been really excited to get
back to work cuz I freaking love it it's
my favorite thing ever and it goes
actually Nick actually goes back to work
on like the 14th so he's still got a
week off and we're still gonna hang out
and stuff so I just never think to bring
out my vlogging camera when I'm around
him because it's always been a thing
that I vlog like for my job during the
day when he's not there and then when
he's there I don't look like it's our
time off together or I was new before I
was with Nick when I was doing YouTube
because I've been with him for like two
years now and the year before they
suppose I think I've been on YouTube
almost three years now well that's so
weird
before I met him I was like just chillin
doing nothing during the day sleeping in
the night edit like really late at night
and I had the worst schedule whereas now
I work like 9:00 to 5:00 like him and so
then when he gets home I switch off kind
of thing so yeah it's always been a bit
difficult for me to then bring out my
camera again and go I'm still working
like I'm still filming but yeah let me
know what you guys want to see this year
I'm excited let's do it
I lost my middle earring so annoyed so I
used to have the little bowl on here and
just fell out mmm
sad about it right now I'm just doing
contracts yeah I'm just doing that right
now um I'm editing my computers gonna
die there and I stupidly didn't bring my
laptop charger so I'm gonna go home and
charge up all my stuff and continue
working from home I mainly came here as
well to do work so the dogs would be
here and I really really missed them
like I miss them so much but they're not
here they're in Palm Beach with my
family
so I now have a few projects coming up
this year and just to get my head into
the swing of things because otherwise I
get really lazy with it might leave it
super last minute you're going to sit
down now and do a few mood boards for
some ideas that I have this year I feel
like my career mood board it really um
it really shows me I could where I'm
going with it and like what I want from
it so what's the project has been
released that I can share all my mood
boards and stuff with you that at that
point that I don't want to give anything
away so I think mood boards are a really
great way of just being able to
visualize what you want and also get a
good idea of what you're going for and
just get inspiration from lots of
different things cuz maybe I you know
when I'm doing a bit of research on my
new boards and stuff I discover things
that I might not have generally wanted
in the first place and on the topic of
mood boards I think actually it's a
really nice motivational thing for you
guys to do in 2018 even if you don't
have projects coming up just to do for
yourself just to like hang in your room
maybe a mood board of your media's
resolutions or things you want to
achieve this year or things that you
absolutely love doing or even a mood
board from 2017 all the things that
you're grateful for because it'll put
you in a really positive mindset so I
just do mind electronically I come with
it to like cut and paste like a lot of
people like to physically like visually
do it but I like doing it online and
just putting a whole bunch of photos
together so that I can see it all in one
place photos that I've taken from all
over the place but yeah if you don't
like to you can always draw if you're
really Ghidorah I'm not but otherwise
you could even just write lists a big
list of everything that you've been
grateful for in 2017 as opposed to
dwelling on the things that you didn't
do or that you didn't achieve yeah just
good headspace I think so I just went to
fresh bone just then and got myself the
Thai salad with chicken and then also a
green smoothie I love this one this is
the sweet green it's got pineapple mint
lemon kale spinach coconut water oh my
god it's delicious and chia seeds I
think I love fresh blood because they
always mix their drinks with coconut
water or almond milk it's not apple
juice and things like that might don't
really like apple juice
so this is my favorite one I'm gonna
head back home now and just continue
doing some editing and some mood
boarding exciting stuff but um I'll see
you guys on together hello hello cheeky
cat cheeky can't touch you guys back
over to my blurring camera but it's my
vlogging camera and it's a lot more
convenient for me to hold but I'm gonna
cook some dinner now show you what I
cook so I feel like passed up and I
don't have any pasta but what I do have
is that like pumpkin pasta that I told
you guys about the other day I think the
last look few folks before kind of wrote
ideas but then I also told you guys
about my Jamie Oliver book so I'm going
to take inspiration from the book but
then kind of put my own spin on it with
one of our ingredients that I have and
scrubbed my sweet potato and I'm just
gonna put this in the oven and make it
really soft because I'm gonna
incorporate this somehow into it
and so this is the cookbook that I was
talking about that Nick's mom got for me
I love it I've already marked off heaps
of pages that I want to cook from what
did I find that inspired me which I mean
a lot of this stuff is so simple so the
coolest thing about it is that it gives
you five ingredients and then you make a
whole dish of it like just really simple
clever ideas like that's mixed seeds
garlic one lemon mixed carrots and
apples yum that would be so good so I've
watched that one off this one I'm taking
inspiration from for the pasta really I
like the look of the sweet potato with
the cherry tomatoes onion I don't have
spring onion but our onion so oh my god
this is my favorite section as well
there's an egg section I love eggs so
make some omelets let's start with that
for sure so yes it was this one that I
also drew inspiration from so it's pasta
with tuna and cherry tomatoes and like
olive oil and some herb so I'm going to
do that but also with some sweet potato
with my pumpkins noodles right they're
probably not making any sense but I just
wanted to show you guys in that cookbook
because you look at the flavors and you
realize like for me personally I always
over complicate everything I ever do
like I over complicate all the meals and
think I need like hundreds of
ingredients I always make the excuse of
I'm not gonna cook because I have
nothing in the fridge but I can always
find stuff I've got lemons sweet potato
fake pasta Chino cherry tomatoes basil
and olive oil any fridge is my new
stainless steel fridge do you like it
yes so this is what I was talking about
see it's carrot and pumpkin needles it
just makes like a fake pasta it's so
good and I've just tried it with like
like leaking sauces and stuff and I
really enjoy it okay so I have a little
over five ingredients but I'm just gonna
use what's a message because my
mushrooms I need to use them before they
go old but I have olive oil lemon cherry
tomatoes tuna onion basil and garlic I
should use fresh but I call this
she really want to along here get rid of
that crap and put her plants but I'll do
that and then salt and pepper on the
mushrooms all right squeeze someone in
put these two on there just to give the
flavor I'm gonna thread the tuner in now
as well so this is what we got so far
and there you have it see it doesn't
look up healing but I just feel like
it's super clever
hmm
it's good
so I'm gonna end the vlog here that you
guys have enjoyed watching and I was
leading this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
