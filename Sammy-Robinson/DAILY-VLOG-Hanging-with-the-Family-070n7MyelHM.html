almost lunchtime
I've just been editing my Sportsgirl
video all morning at supply these this
morning now I've finished the majority
of that I've just got a little bit to go
and then I'm going to put through
handbrake and get it all set up oh it
started raining outside let me go get
myself a salad from fresh blend and a
coffee but it started raining outside
and I don't really want to walk in the
rain maybe I wait I want to do my
sister's makeup because it's her formal
today and I'm going to the AFL maybe if
it stops raining I'm not going if it's
raining I got my skipping rope out
because we've been doing skipping with
our boxing sessions at the gym and I
really love skiing
I'm really enjoying the cold weather at
the moment putting hoodies on and really
just cozying up because it makes editing
really fun oh my god I stitch it was
better I found my other quote book this
is from kekeke as old like the one I
showed you in the last vlog I thought I
would read you a quote from this one if
you have good thoughts they will shine
out of your face like sunbeams and you
will always look lovely you can always
tell when a person is a really nice
genuine caring person because they've
got this warmth about them just always
aspire to be and always want people to
think of me I want to radiate warmth and
so if you're a really nice caring kind
compassionate person you'll instantly
just look lovely yeah I was like my
random cowgirl hoodie I don't think it's
mine Sakura seen it before in my life
very gloomy cloudy day very cold today's
my little bean
hey rude
yeah yes please how does camera know
fugitive man ma'am okay yeah got my Thai
salad and my coffee so I got this
delivery from Zala hair and I really
want to try put them on I'm hoping these
ones are a little bit shorter than the
other ones I have a brush and clip and I
think this is what you keep the hair in
which is kind of cool that's a really
really pretty length but I think it
might be a little too dark as you can
see my hair is quite blonde I'm going to
try them anyway okay so I've just put
them in and not the exact perfect color
there's so funner to the cooler you can
just like change your look up so now
that I've made the effort to put
extensions in I'm going to start filling
so I'm going to do my princess Holly
Hall now okay you started to finish
filming at my hall this is the aftermath
of my whole it's just laying or lay down
on my bed so I don't know if this video
will be going up before or after the
whole either way one of them will be up
on this Sunday and then one of them will
be up Wednesday it's only one of my
favorite holes I've ever filmed just
because it's a really good variety of
stuff like it has to make up some
jewelry some glasses clothes summer
winter bit of everything so yes if that
is already up I will link it in my
description box yes now I'm going to go
downstairs and get an afternoon snack
and go help mum set up for the party
poor mum has been slaving away for
Jessica because Jessica's having an
after party for her formal with my
sister so mums been organizing heaps of
stuff with her so I'll go downstairs and
help them set up and then I'm going to
do Jessica's makeup so I'll show you
guys the little setup it's quite cool
actually
they've cleared the lounge room and
the exam space oh and some food that I'm
going to be eating I'll eat it all
before they come what do you think and
then this is the marquee outside check
my extensions huh
and then this is the marquee how cool is
this
so basically there's like a little
wooden floor and as you can see it
cleared up beautifully so Jessica's very
lucky that's very nice weather and then
this is a nice little sitting area for
everyone to come and hang all those keys
are you going to party hard tonight if
you're not going to have a dance later
tricking everyone with non-alcoholic
champagne tricky mum mum loves going to
have manly freezes it's a place where
you can buy everything in bulk so you
can get a whole bunch of lollies and
stuffing huge packets and so a lot
cheaper so you guys are from Sydney
manly freezes is really good for parties
I'm just going to be here at the lovely
table well I came down to help mum set
up but she looks like she's already
already kind of there how can I help you
with Monday she doesn't want to be in
the video maybe I can go get Katie here
from school now what time is it okay
I'll go get us already well I'm going to
go get my sister and then I will
probably start filming again when I do
justice makeup so I'll show you guys a
before and after okay here we go so now
I'm just home just picked up Kate and
then now about to just kiss make Alec so
I'll do a bit of it before and after
probably won't film the whole thing just
because this Bloods already gonna be so
long for walkie others said I'll show
you guys what I do if I have face just
because she's got kind of textured skin
and I'll show you what primers and stuff
I'll use for that textured skin like a
little bit drier yes yes let's see I'll
just put here
okay so I'm gonna start off with the
Marc Jacobs coconut Canada because her
skin is very dry I'll just get you to
put on just moisturizer
let's get very drive to listen to make
sure you're moisturizing it really well
otherwise you know ii will be quite
flaky now i'm going to take the smashbox
photo finish foundation primer this
one's more of a smoothing primer so
it'll fill in any of her pores and
smooth out any of the texture of the
skin so i'm just going to put a bit of
this all over her skin just let that
sink in now and then i'm going to go in
we go in with the my jacobs remarkable
foundational purses full coverage we
don't need that much of it so i can
spread it out quite evenly on her skin
then i'll probably mix this with a
little bit of the coconut primer as well
just to thin it out a little bit because
it is so thick and i'm going to use a
beauty blender to blend that into a skin
as well because that will make the most
flawless finish you don't to start with
too much for people really get quite
cakey so you want to build it up
and I'm matching her permission to
Annette because you go throw down
I'm going to go ahead and just do the
rest of my makeup off camera and then
I'll show you guys the after okay so
before so here's an after and you can
see it's my flawless skin not too
over-the-top but then we've just gone
for really nice bronzy eye and some half
lashes we can give no orange lighting I
decided to give the AFL a skip today
it's just so cold and rainy and I just
knew it that I probably wasn't going to
enjoy it very much so instead I am
sitting here editing now 7 p.m. I'm just
editing in Katie's chilling up here
while we wait for the afters and watch
MasterChef the people the kids are kids
coming back they're all coming back from
the afters at like 11:30 so I'm going to
stay up till then so that we can
confiscate any alcohol yeah yeah this
weekend is the long weekend so I'm going
out to dinner tomorrow night and then
I've got drinks on Saturday so I thought
it'd be best just to have a chilled ones
like because it is only Thursdays so and
I'll go film a video tomorrow triumphal
I will probably leave the vlog here I
hope you guys have enjoyed it and I just
another little daily vlogs I will see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
