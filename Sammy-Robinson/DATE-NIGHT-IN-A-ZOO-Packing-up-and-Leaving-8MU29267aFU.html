when the tents a-rockin don't come
a-knockin oh my god that is absolutely
incredible
can you sneak me hello guys and welcome
to this vlog it's actually the day after
today but I kind of got too awkward to
introduce the vlog yesterday in front of
all those people that we were at we were
with with all those people that we were
with but we got to do roar and snore
with Taronga Zoo
Nick bought it for me for my Christmas
present and it was so much fun did you
have a good time yes different yeah very
different yeah it was really cool and we
had sort of four weird sort of four tour
guides taking us around and telling us
about all the animals and they all just
know so much about every animal and
about the ones that are really
endangered and we're telling us all the
ones that need help and all the
conservation efforts that they're making
and all the money that goes from roar
and snore like that obviously isn't soda
catered to like the tents and the food
and stuff goes into the animals and
helping funding programs that they've
got going on because they've got a lot
of you know the Tigers that are going
extinct trying to breed more Tigers and
breed lots more animals everything it
was actually very very interesting and
Nick was actually cameraman most of the
day yesterday which was nice very good
and yeah so that was really fun we got
back this morning and then I've just had
heaps of sort of phone call meetings
today I've meant to film two videos and
I didn't get to do either of them it's
now around four o'clock five o'clock and
the lighting is actually quite nice as I
kind of could film here show you the
outside very great weather and it's
gonna get dark probably within like an
hour so I don't really have time to film
and Daisy's coming over in about 45
minutes because we're going to the
opening of the open-air cinema in Bondi
and they're showing the greatest show

hopefully it doesn't and then it goes
Sunday Monday and then I'm leaving it's
always Slough so the rest of their days

decided I'm gonna film because although
yes it's very grey outside I reckon I
can do it
it's like finished filming and it's
still light outside score and just did
my foundation routine at the moment a
lot of you guys are always asking about
my skin and how I get my skin to look
the way it is and it's all the power
magic power magic the power of makeup in
