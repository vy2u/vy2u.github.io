because I've done a festival inspired
makeup look that's in collaboration with
the movie trolls and I got inspired by
the troll DJ Spooky because DJ Souki is
just lots of bright pink colors so
although I'm not bright pink all over I
wanted to make this festival inspired
look quite wearable so I went with pink
tones definitely toned it down to more
wearable baby Pink's so that you guys
could wear this to a festival or you
know to a party or whatever you want
yeah so basically because DJ stuckey is
think I just wanted to incorporate a lot
of different kinds of pink on the eye on
the lips I put a wash of baby pink um
it's like a sheer powder all over my
chest and then I've actually put I've
put a little bit of pink through my hair
but the hairspray didn't really work so
I don't know if you guys can see that so
the movie is a really cute movie I have
to admit I am an absolute sucker for are
tuned to always love them and the trolls
movie is about finding your happy place
and spreading happiness and I think
that's just completely adorable so you
guys should definitely go check out that
movie if you haven't already if you guys
would love to see how this makeup look
turned out then just keep on watching so
to begin I took my outlast stay fabulous
foundation from covergirl in the shade
golden tan and then put some Smashbox
Studios skin 24-hour waterproof
concealer in the shade light/medium
underneath my eyes just to give myself a
flawless base as we're putting a lot of
color on so you want your base to be as
flawless as possible so just blending
that out with my Beauty Blender and then
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm just going to bake
underneath my eyes to set my concealer
and then also baked my eyelids so
that our shadow doesn't crease later
with the same translucent powder I'm
just setting my whole entire face and
then taking my urban decay I think it's
the naked illuminated bronzer it's
beautiful it has little shimmers in it
and I'm just going to bronze up the
outer perimeter of my face I just wanted
everything to be really really glowy in
this look so I wanted to Brunn's with a
shimmery bronzer and then I'm going to
contour as well with my Bahama Mama
bronzer by the balm so then taking my
Becca
duo with the blush shade flower child
I'm going to put a lot of blush on my
cheeks because we'll be putting a lot of
pink on our eyes and pink everywhere so
you want it to all balance out so load
the blush on and then also the
highlighter champagne pop so just put
this all over the high points of your
face I'm putting quite a lot of it on as
I have gold stars going on later so this
champagne e color will tie the gold in
and all the pinks and golds together
will make a sort of a beautiful rose
gold then picking up my Burberry runway
palette which is just an extremely
glittery highlighter I'm just laying
that over the top just to give it more
festival vibes by putting glitter
everywhere
I just think of glitter when I think of
festivals so I just wanted to make the
highlight of super intense now I'm going
into my lorac Pro unzipped palette and
I'm taking that light pink shade and
using that as a transition shade all
through my crease and then once I have
the transition down pat I'm going to
take a smaller brush and start loading
that on the outer and inner corners to
start making a halo eye effect so I'm
basically just rounding the shade out
through my crease and leaving the lids
bare for another color to put on later
and I'm just picking up more as I go and
building it up and then going into the
darker ready a shade I'm doing exactly
the same thing just deepening up those
areas
deepening up the outer corner the inner
corner through the crease making that
halo effect and leaving the lid
completely bare so now I'm going to jump
into my morphe 35o palette and pick up
this gorgeous champagne ii boiled shade
and i'm going to pack that on with my
finger and then i will just take a brush
and sort of blend out the edges just so
there's not that really harsh line and
then i'm going to begin the exact same
process on my bottom lash line so i'm
going to deepen up the outer corners of
my eyes the inner corners as well and
make that halo effect on the bottom
lashline and then I'll put some of the
shimmery shade right in the center and
then take the exact same shade and put
it on my inner corner as well then I
wanted the glitter to pop more so I put
on a bit of my stiller Magnificent
medals in the shade kitten Karma right
on the center of where the halo is on
the bottom and the top lashline and then
I took my favorite at the moment the
Stila extreme lash mascara and just put
a light coat on my lashes just because
I'm about to put falsies on so it
doesn't matter too much and then I took
the House of lashes style iconic okay so
now I'm taking a bit of my Anastasia dip
brow pomade in blonde and just filling
in my eyebrows and then going over with
my benefit Ready Set brow clear brow gel
just to set them in place and now for
the fun part I'm taking some stars and
I'm gonna stick them underneath my eye
just using some eyelash glue it actually
works really well
and then I'm going to line my lips with
my hourglass lip line in panoramic and
then fill them in with the Kylie
cosmetics liquid lipstick in Coke okay I
wanted to use a really baby pink so this
one worked perfectly and then I just put
a whole bunch of glitter all over me
basically I put it underneath my eyes to
like sort of seemed like the stars were
raining or glittering and DJ Sookie had
freckles so I thought I could just make
it cute by making some gold Fraggles
okay I'm sorry you guys can probably
hear that my computer is freaking out
its overheating so I'm just gonna
quickly finish this voice over now so
basically after all the makeup is done I
just tried a few different things so I
try to flower crown on I tried putting
some BYU s um body shoes on so it was
like a pink sheer sort of shimmery
fifith powder
I don't know it just made a really nice
iridescent sheen over my chest I then
sprayed my chest with some setting spray
with the glitter all over my chest as
well and then I put some a pink
hairspray again I don't really know what
brand it was I got it ages to go to $2
shop but um I tried to bring that
through my hair and it didn't show off
that well but anyway so you guys can
play around once the makeups done and
see what you can see what you like and
how you want to decorate your outfit
okay so that's the end of the video I
hope you guys have enjoyed it make sure

movie if you haven't already and I would
