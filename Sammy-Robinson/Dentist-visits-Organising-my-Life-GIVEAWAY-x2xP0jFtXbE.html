filming and massive coal for you guys
which will already be up you will I've
already watched that video however I
thought it would just be interesting for
you guys to see what I do after I do
these big unboxings because there is
just rubbish and crap everywhere and
just show you how I organize myself I'm
gonna be leaving all the clothes and the
shoes out because I'm gonna start
putting outfit ideas together for New
York but when it comes to rubbish one
big bag full of all the rubbish that
isn't recyclable and it's usually packed
to the brim because it's like everything
covered in plastic and then when it
comes to the boxes I collect one huge
box and I will put all the paper in
there that that way I can still recycle
that and all the other little boxes I
flatten so I unfold them and flatten
them because we get so many packages I
don't have enough framing now being an
area to keep all my stuff constantly and
my family like my mom is just like about
it also trying to make it as small and
compact does that possibly can so that's
what I'm gonna do now and then I just
made breakfast and I'm well they know
any myself cuz I thought I was supposed
to do what I eat in a day but basically
I had just scrambled eggs on toast with
avocado and turkey which is random but
yummy well I also got this beautiful
palm beach candle from The Boathouse
group I got a Liberty house all the time
for like brekkie and lunch so how cool
they collaborated with a candle so then
once I have put all the boxes away and
take that out to the rubbish then
organize my stuff into piles so this is
a pile of stuff my sauces that I will
use and will just put away in my big
makeup drawers and my bathroom this is
all stuff that I'll put on my immediate
desk so right in my top drawer of stuff
that I want to try and I'll just keep
these on my makeup desk just before I do
my May
up so yes I really want to try these in
the Naz foundations and my clinic ones
I've just got all my clothes still here
coz I'm just currently trying them on
and then I made a little pile of stuff
for giveaways so this is stuff that
either I have or I think that you guys
would like or I just don't need because
I've got something like it so I put it
in past week giveaways and my friends
and family and stuff like that so thank
you so much to Mecca they sent me these
beautiful flowers for hitting 500,000 on
years YouTube they're so beautiful
so I am currently just trying on some of
the outfits now that I got from princess
Holly
um then I'm going to actually insert
them in my last hole so if you guys want
to see some of the new clothes that I
got just head over to my last haul I
swear my sister is sabotaging me she
always gets those half chokers and then
never eats a chips the best trips in the
freaking whole entire world but I don't
need this in my life every day so
I'm gonna make myself prone to protein
shake in a minute but right now I'm just
having a kombucha and just drinking some
water I'm gonna make yeah it's some sort
of yummy protein shake and then maybe go
get myself a coffee even and I'm feeling
like the liquids a very very thirsty
I've just finished sort of organizing
everything putting things away etc etc
trying outfits on and now I'm just gonna
sit down and edit the first adhere the
whole and my bad time I might even start
editing this video that you guys are
watching it's got a lot of stuff to do
before I go yeah I'll show you guys the
giveaway soon as well so stay tuned it's
time for some lunch now I'm not gonna
make lunch I was having a snack now I'm
gonna make a protein shake sticky sticky
Henry come on go
I love you thank you but I thought I
would show you guys the protein shake
that I've been making so I usually do
this after the gym which I would have
done this morning but I did my whole and
I just didn't do it so I'm just gonna
have it now it's a bit of a pre lunch so
I know you want to see what I'm
surrounded by like on the daily right
behind you here you've got a big block
of melted chocolate that I've been
eating with a spoon and we've got a big
brownie here that is brownie on top and
Chocolate Chunk cookies on the bottom
like are you kidding okay so in terms of
protein the proteins that I've been
using this one I have been using for a
while now it's body protein by the
beauty chef you guys know I love the
beauty chef why am i had a breath and
pretty much the reason that I love this
one is because it's got its got protein
powder superfood powers pretty bad
prebiotics and probiotics in it so it's
kind of like my like vitamin mineral
probiotic shot as well as some protein
so I do kind of like half a scoop of
this one and then the gorgeous series
day on YouTube has got me into Tripucka
I watched her one of her videos just
like on the search page randomly one
time and I bought I know if you guys
remember how you use the ultra cleanse
that goes off the cleanse something from
chirpy chirpy cat ages ago and anyways a
lot of you guys were like oh sorry Stan
uses this so I now have just been
watching all my videos because she's
freaking amazing
if you guys want an awesome health
channel you guys will have to check her
out she's so cool she's just got she
gives awesome info and like protein
powders and stuff and I clearly stuff
that I love doing like you know my
health shots and exercising but I'm not
very good at explaining it and I kind of
am like a messy me amateur edit but
she's really she's very intelligent yes
if you guys want to check her out you
definitely should go so I tried I bought
this lame person because of her and I
mean I think I preferred this one I'm
there they both have protein I believe
see this one is pea protein and brown
rice protein and this one is brown rice
protein and pea protein so it's pretty
much the same thing and I both have just
really good stuff in that so
I kind of just do Haas good with this
one and then hop skip this one really
love the flavor this one I do half a
banana I do a few strawberries I also
just cut these up and put them in Ziploc
bags like spinach just to get my brains
in and so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to fill this up all the way to the top
with water gets like a good cup out of
it maybe this it's like a cup and a half
of water in and if I have rib out put
some ice well I just stumbled upon
something oh so I am currently watching
this video it feels so weird to be
watching myself on another person think
you're taking what I'm what I do I just
wanted to come on here and just say
something like two things about it
that's like who's that why did no one
tell me how awful my old glasses looked
on me I'm watching this video and
getting excited I really very watch my
old videos and I'm like oh my god
they're like this be on my face and
secondly she's talking about how
intermittent fasting which I did for
like a day like I haven't done that in a
long time it just didn't really work
with my lifestyle I go for a lot of
meetings in the mornings and I train in
the morning and I just I don't like
training fasted so I mean I do it
occasionally like here and there because
it's actually really not
like she's saying there's a lot of
research that proves that it's actually
quite good for you got my brows looking
crazy but enough like I don't really
feel the need to talk about intermittent
fasting because I don't really do it all
that much it's uh it's just something
that I tried for like a day and I just
decided to film with you guys one thing
she does saying it is that it's a diet
and us girls are chasing our tails going
around in circles on these diets and I I
just wanted to clear that up
intermittent fasting isn't a diet it's
actually just a lifestyle so you eat
exactly the same amount of calories but
you're just eating it or would like the
right amount of calories for yourselves
you just eat it eat it in a shorter span
of time and it gives your body proper
time to digest and again I don't know
enough about it to be sitting here and
giving you guys all the info and like
suggesting that you guys go and do it
because I don't even do it myself but I
just thought that I'd put that out there
because she's making me look like I'm
going on this crazy diet and starving
myself whereas I'm not I wasn't doing
that at all I know I've never been one
to go on diets I've never been one to
restrict myself so it's because I would
eat the proper amount of food during the
day and then I just get some it would
get to night time and it's just it's
more what I think man Nick's influence
on each other he after dinner starts
like making dessert and then like I
don't get competitive with him no not
literally you know I mean like when
you've got a boyfriend you just watching
movies you want ice cream and chocolate
like it's not so painted the world it's
just I was trying to just give myself a
shorter amount of time to eat so that I
wasn't overeating like how was that I
mean it wasn't an issue I wasn't worried
about it was just something when I tried
out and yeah so I'm not gonna keep
watching this video because I just don't
like I don't like I don't like knowing
people's opinions of me I don't I don't
like reading stuff about me I don't like
any of that because I know who I am
I just if you have like people can have
their opinions I'm
I'm not fast yes I just wanted to put it
put that out there because I don't like
that she made it seem like I was
starving myself on a diet
good late most definitely wasn't what's
not doing that I don't know how she
makes bass is her thing off making
videos about other people I mean like
I've never really watched her videos
before my friend actually just told me
my friend just told me that she made a
video on me last night when I was at
dinner and I was like what that someone
made a video on me like why do they care
oh yeah I had another thing to say to
you guys I forgot to tell you guys I
don't know how this wasn't like the
first thing I said I didn't get my
apartment I didn't get the house which I
thought I'd be a lot sadder about
because this place is perfect I just
kind of already envisioned it as my
house and I imagined the furniture I'm
gonna buy and like moving in and when it
was gonna happen I just like it didn't
give myself the option of no to be
honest but now that it is no I'm not
actually that disheartened because I did
rush into it and now this will give me a
good opportunity to go have a look
around and see what else is out on the
market and I I'm sad but I'm also like
okay I'm okay I'm okay with it
um that is the update it's super rainy
and overcast out there that's why I put
my jumper on I'll show you it started
raining before and so it's super
gleaming out gloomy outside yeah hey
guys so it is the next day today I
didn't finish off loving last night
because I just watched the bachelor
finale goes to you today I just went to
the gym just rushed home done a bit of
makeup showered acceptor and now I'm off
to deer fly dental I'm getting my teeth
finally checked this stupid bite see if
I can like fix that up a little bit it's
just a consult though so I think it's
just gonna be a Chad I'm not really too
sure what's happening but something does
happen I'll bring you guys along to that
but I think today is just gonna be a
consult so so I just came out of the
dentist
and basically what I've told you guys he
said is very true my bite is completely
off and it's actually you know how I
always talk really funny to the side
pieces that I've quite literally because
I'm trying to find a spot for my teeth
to sit I've started talking like that
and like I've actually like completely
moved to my jaw so we're going to do
Invisalign and just correct my jaw and
my bite and hopefully I'll start talking
normally in a robe guys few things to
talk about didn't finish it off
yesterday's vlog because I got my Rick

interesting different ones pop up which
