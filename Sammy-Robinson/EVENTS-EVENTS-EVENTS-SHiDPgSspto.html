I'm most excited about is this cream
contour wand which is just so
interesting like I've never seen a wand
like that I mean my Estee Lauder one

event in the morning breakfast so the
collectors events and I think I'll bring
you guys along to all of them but I
probably won't show you as in-depth as I
did last night because otherwise it'll
be as always it will be too long of a
vlog so how pretty is this I'm so
excited about this one isn't that just
like the perfect nude
comfortable gorgeous deep red shade food
that I just tried on a pinky a lighter
nude rosy pinky color stunning oh so
much to clean always so much rubbish oh
my gosh so I'm just getting ready for my
advanced Neutrogena and I just used the
cream highlighter and bronzer Oh My look
at that highlight okay so this is my
outfit of the day I've decided to go to
this this is actually a swimsuit by
Belaya and these jeans a Topshop and
some heels I have no idea where these
are from
and my Gucci bag oh I'm out of breath
cuz I've had to chase Henry up the
street yes anyway for about ten minutes
to go before I have to leave and I'm
contemplating whether or not to bring my
camera tonight if you guys would find it
that interesting watching a blog full of
events you know I mean because they're
similar people generally every time and
yeah what's cool that this event is
actually for the launch of the led mask
which I've been using here that you guys
have probably seen all over my snapchat
it's my little alien mask that I wear
whenever I feel like my skin needs a
reboot so I've decided I'm not going to
I decided I'm not going to actually
bring my camera tonight just because
it's going to be too much for you guys
and then tomorrow morning I will bring
you guys along to the Clarins event just
because it's a breakfast turn something
a little bit different to last night so
I will see you guys tomorrow how you on
my car now hi is it too close feel like
