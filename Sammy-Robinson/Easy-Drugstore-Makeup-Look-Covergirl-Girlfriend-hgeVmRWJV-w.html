moment editing my video that I did in
collaboration with girlfriend and cover
girl I went in and did a few videos with
the girlfriend team and so I've just
filmed a look using all covergirl
products which are really great
affordable products but I thought I
would just come on here and do a quick
preface to the video because yeah I
thought I would put this up on my
channel just to show you guys as well
so yeah here is a video of me using all
covergirl products just creating really
simple easy makeup look so I hope you
guys enjoy it and I'll see you in my
next video
girlfriend and their friends are
covergirl they're on the lookout to find
the next big stars to join their Beauty
squad today I'm going to create this
look on my face here it's just a really
easy everyday natural bronzy makeup look
that everyone has been loving at the
moment it's definitely probably one of
the most popular looks going around that
allows you to look like yourself but
generally just enhances your natural
features and makes you look really fresh
and alive and I'm going to be using all
covergirl products so if you would like
to see how I achieve this look then just
keep on watching so to begin I'm going
to take my covergirl outlast stay
fabulous foundation in the shade golden
tan I'm going to start by spreading it
out over my face this foundation is one
of my all-time favorites I have had this
foundation for the longest time I always
come back to it eventually and I find
it's a really lightweight foundation but
has an amazing coverage to it so it's
not uncomfortable it doesn't feel like
it's too much on the skin so because
today's look is a really natural
everyday bronzy look we are going to
keep the coverage quite minimal now I'm
going to take my covergirl invisible
concealer in the shade medium and I'm
just going to conceal the bags under my
eyes and just so that we keep as
symmetry throughout the whole face I'm
going to put a little bit on my forehead
down the bridge of my nose and on my
chin now I'm going to set that concealer
down in place with my advanced radiance
press powder
one two zero so now faux pas one of the
most important steps of this tutorial we
are going to take a baked bronzer and
bronze the outer perimeter of our face
so I'm taking the covergirl trublend
bronzer to do this this bronzer is
beautiful because although it doesn't
have shimmers it does definitely have a
sheen to it so it's going to give you
that really beautiful glowy effect that
everyone is trying to achieve these days
it makes you look really alive and awake
and healthy I find when I bronze my skin
I tend to think of it as drawing a 3 on
my face so I take a little bit of the
bronzer and I start on my forehead and
then down to my jawbone so essentially
drawing a 3 on your face ok so now
moving on to blush we're going to take
the covergirl trublend blush and we are
going to just add a little bit of a
sheen to our cheeks using this I find
blush just adds a really beautiful
radiance and healthy flush to the cheeks
so moving on to the brows I'm going to
be taking the covergirl brow and liner
powder in the shade 8 1-0 tend to stick
to the outer arch of my eyebrow and keep
the center looking very soft just so
that you don't block it in and when
doing my brows I just use a very light
hand and just fill in the sparse areas
moving on to eye shadow I have two
eyeshadow quads here these are the
covergirl one two three four eyes shadow
palette it comes with four different
shades and I'm going to be using the
quad 700 notice me nudes these quads are
great because they come with a variety
of shades starting from light to dark
and it gives you the ability to achieve
lots of different eye looks with it
take the shade number three and I'm
using that to define the outer corner of
my eye and add a little bit of
definition into the outer socket of my
eye
to blend it out a little tip from me is
I often take the bronzer shade that I
use the ones that are used on my cheek
on a big blending brush and I just blend
out what I did in the crease this will
make your whole eye look a lot easier to
blend and add a lot more warmth into the
crease I'm going to take the shade
number one on my finger and I'm going to
pack this on my eyelid packing a lighter
shade on the center of your eyelid will
just brighten up your whole eye look and
make your eyes pop so I'm going to take
that same shade and put it on my tear
ducts this will again open up your eyes
and just make everything a lot brighter
now for mascara I'm going to be taking
the covergirl LashBlast Volume Mascara
this mascara is great because it doesn't
put too much product on at one time
it really lengthens your lashes instead
of making them clumpy
so now for lipstick I have four
different shades of the covergirl
lipsticks I have a nude more of a rosy
nude eh I'd say that's a peachy
nectarine color i they call it yep sweet
tangerine and I have a blush shade so um
all of these would be perfect for a
summer bronzy look but I think I'm going
to go with number two six five romance
move move move move
so there we have it that is the final
makeup loft if you would like to become
a beauty vlogger for girlfriend and
covergirl just head to girlfriend Comden
au we can't wait to see your beauty
blogs bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
