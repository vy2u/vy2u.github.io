you so much for watching today I'm just
going to do an everyday makeup routine
it was highly requested when I did my
everyday sort of night makeup routine
last time so I thought I'd just give you
a really fresh easy quick makeup look to
do and I'll see how to achieve really
easy everyday makeup routine please to
keep watching but I'm going to start off
by prepping my skin with this I've been
I don't actually know how to pronounce
it but it's a thermal spring water
soothing spray so it just kind of
moisturizes my skin that feels really
nice and refreshing then I'm going to
take this goodness certified organic
chia seed oil so I'm just going to take
a few drops of that and I'm going to Pat
it into my skin
it doesn't smell very good but it's
really good for your skin fact it smells
quite gross
then to moisturize my skin I'm going to
take this juice beauty it's done the
cellular moisturizer it's just in a tub
like this and the reason I love this is
because it has a comp or you just press
it down and the moisturizer comes on top
and you can just take a powder and again
I'll just be patting that into my skin
it's really important in pinpointing
it's really important to moisturize your
skin so next I'm taking this Rimmel
lasting finish primer just because it's
always important to prime your skin
all right so really unsure foundation I
like to use my all day luminous
weightless foundation in the color Tahoe
because it's a really really light
consistency and it's not going to make
you feel cakey or heavy on your face
during the day and I like to mix that
with my J bronze shimmer in shimmer
instant alumina like to take any brush
and I just mix them together on a little
flat surface and then I'll just put it
on my face I'm just going to buff that
into my skin so I'm taking my Coastal
Scents s 30 flat top kabuki brush and
I'm just buffing that foundation into my
skin another really good tool to use for
an everyday sort of foundation or BB
cream is a Beauty Blender because it
gives you a really seamless finish and
it blends in really nicely and it takes
off any excess product of your face that
obviously doesn't need to be there so
that's a really good tool to use as well
I just don't have it on me at home I
make sure you're always bringing it down
your neck so that you don't have that
strong line there so as you can see I
had one pump of the foundation and one
pump of the shimmer illuminizer
and I sort of used it all so I'm not
trying to cake and lay on my face I'm
just trying to give myself a really thin
even complexion just evening out my skin
tone so on an everyday basis if I'm just
doing a really light makeup look I'll
stick with cream products usually so I'm
gonna take this Becca blush in the shade
that's or golf I'm sorry I don't know
the shade of it it's rubbed off but I'm
going to take this Becca this Becca
cream blush and just with my finger I'm
just going to tap that onto the apples
of my cheeks
I think it's really important for an
everyday look to use cream products so
that you don't look like you have tons
of powder on your face it's really
obvious so it just sinks into your skin
and just looks like your skin it's
really good to use your fingers as well
because your fingers have that natural
heat and warmth to them so it's just
going to melt the product into your face
and then I'm just going to take a little
bit of my concealer I'm using the
instant age rewind concealer in the
shade light pale and I'm just going to
use that to brighten up my under eyes
again just using your finger to blend
that product in and melt it into your
skin
and when Robin yo concealer in don't rub
and swipe your finger just dab it into
your skin just so that you don't create
any fine lines and wrinkles I don't
think it's necessarily essential to set
your whole face but I do think you
should set your under-eye concealer just
so that does increase and get the fine
lines under your eyes so I'm just going
to take a bit of my AC on top contour
and highlighting kit from Australis take
a bit of the banana shade and just
lightly dab that under your eyes just
setting that concealer and keeping it
nice and bright
now I don't wear a bronzer every day but
I'll do it in this video just to give
you the option I'm going to take a cream
bronzer so just from this shade I'm
going to take this
the second darkest color just here and
I'm just going to run that on my
cheekbones just to bronze up that area
I'm not doing any heavy contouring or
anything just bronzing up the sides of
our faces just add a little bit of
dimension back into your face again this
is totally optional you don't have to do
this on an everyday basis because it
does take a little bit longer but if
you're feeling a little bit pale then
you can just add a bit of cream bronzer
so the last step to the face is
highlighter again totally optional you
don't have to do is every day I just
think it makes your face look really
healthy and radiant so I'm going to take
my Becca highlighter in the shade opal
yeah opal not over the tops of my
cheekbones
and this is a Coastal Scents fan brush
the s39 brush
I just think by adding a little bit of
highlighter it just makes you look
really healthy and radiant
so I'm running that down the bridge of
my nose over the tip of my nose on my
Cupid's bow and a little bit above my
eyebrows so after I've done all of that
with the face I again just take this
thermal spring water and I just spray a
little bit over my face again just to
further melt all the products into my
face and look make it look a little bit
more natural so that's the face done now
it was a lot of products for everyday I
don't use all of them every day
necessarily but I was just giving you
the option showing you how to do it and
what I would do if I did use all of them
didn't even make sense but you know what
I mean so now moving on to the eyes I'm
just going to take a little bit of that
Becca highlighter again and using my
ring finger I'm just going to run that
over my eyelid
and on my inner tear ducts
now to add a little bit of depth to the
eyes I'm going to take my Bahama Mama
bronzer and the Sigma e-40 tapered
blending brush I'm just going to run a
little bit of that in my crease again
totally optional
so when you're feeling a bit tired and
rundown a good tip is to add a bit of
white or cream eyeliner to your
waterline it just really opens up and
brightens your eyes final step to the
eyes is to add mascara so my favorite
mascara at the moment is the L'Oreal
Paris false lash wings mascara it just
really separates your lashes really
nicely and adds a lot of volume and
length so how I put mascara on is I just
run it through the bottom and then I
just blink and it just goes all the way
through my lashes and again mascara just
opens up your eyes and makes you look
more awake and adds a little bit of
definition to your eyes so the purpose
of all these products that we've used is
just to enhance your natural beauty and
just to make you look more vibrant and
awake and bright it's perfect for if
you're going to work if you want to uni
and then I'm going to add a little bit
of mascara to my bottom lash line as
well so the final step is the lips so
often on an everyday basis I will
usually just line my lips and with a
really natural-looking lip liner and
I'll leave it at that but because today
the theme of my makeup seems to be
really brightening makeup look I will
use a lip gloss as well and that again
just really brightens up your face so
I'm going to start by using this
bareMinerals marvelous Moxie lip liner
in the shade liberated and I'm just
going to run that over the outside of my
lips just to give them a little bit of
definition
so often that's where I leave my lips
I'll either line them or I'll put a bit
of my velvet teddy from Mac over them
but today I'm going to use my NYX butter
gloss in the shade Eclair and I'm just
going to put that straight over the top
