I did this everyday night makeup routine
so something you would wear to the
movies on a date to drinks with your
friends at a bar or a pub to dinner
anything like that if you want to see an
everyday makeup routine I can film that
but otherwise just do this look without
their lashes in the liner or just take a
take away anything that you'd want to
take away or you think it's just too
much for the day but let me know in the
comments if you're going to do an
everyday makeup routine as well
otherwise just keep watching alright
because I've been so Tyler they are
going to be taking to your concealers
the first one we'll be taking is the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and this one's specifically for dark
circles because it has a pink undertone
to it and so what that does is the pink
counteracts any blue underneath your
eyes married it to the color
then I'll be taking this Rimmel wake me
up concealer in the shade classic beige
and what I'll be doing with this is just
running that over the top of the pink
concealer that we placed our before
we'll also be taking it that down ridge
above nose and on our chin just to
brighten those areas as well taking the
other end of the beauty blender I'll
just be buzzing let out to be taking
this bareMinerals 5 5 in one cream
eyeshadow I'm just going to do a few
lines on my eye and I'm just going to
repress that exciting
so
now to set all the back in place I'm
going to be using this Jessup tapered
face brush and my AC on to contour and
highlighting kit I'm just going to be
taking these two shades here and just
going to be running that over all of
this box that we highlighted
tapping it on to the you don't review
the product around we're also going to
be setting that eyeshadow base
I'm going to be taking this Smashbox
photo filter creamy powder foundation
it's just a darker powder and I'm just
going to be running that over the rest
of the face just to set the foundation
in place
take your favourite control brush I'm
going to be using the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil medium deep matte
bronzer and I'm just going to run the
tip of my brush in it and run it under
the hollows of my cheek bones
alright so now I'm just going to be
taking this Adele brouse sculpting gel
it's just a clear gel and I'm just going
to be running that through my eyebrows
this just sets your eyebrows in place so
moving on to eye shadow now
I'm going to be using this Tuesday's
naturalise palette it just has a whole
heap of neutral shades in it this is the
e-40 tater tempting brush by Sigma and
I'm just going to take the shade nudie
down here I'm going to run that through
my crease
sorry I probably should have assumed
doing before now taking a smaller
tapered blending brush this one's by
Jetta I'm going to take Kashmir bunny
and I'm going to run that on the outer
part of the crease
with this look I'm attempting to even
gave my eyes
now on the same brush we're going to be
taking to shade start back up to top and
I just gonna run that right in the
socket line where we placed Kashmir
buddy so now taking the original large
blending brush we're just going to blend
all of that out taking this short shader
brush by Jessup and this Inglot muddy
pigment powder
it's just a pure black powder I'm just
going to be creating a subtle wing on
the ends of my eye I'm not going to be
bringing it over my eyelid or in I'm
literally just going to be doing it on
hand of mallet
now I'm just gonna put some scar on I'm
taking the Larios full-swing this car
and I'm just going to coat my top and
bottom lashes
so I'm just going to be taking the NYX
jumbo pencil in milk which is just a big
white pass
I'm going to be carefully this is super
pigmented carefully lining my bottom
lash line so next I'm going to apply
some lashes I must find this blue Lala
eyelashes
hola - I like it and they're just these
lashes are just hard slashes top lashes
are great for beginners as well because
it's so simple to put on all you do is
you place them the outer edge of your
lash so you just stick it down already
so our lashes are on now I make it it's
done now and so I'm just going to get
back to the rest of my face
