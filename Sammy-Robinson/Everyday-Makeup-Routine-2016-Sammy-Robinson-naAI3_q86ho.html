today's video is my go to makeup look
it's the makeup I've been leaning
towards lately and it's including all my
absolute favorite products of the moment
so I thought it would be sort of like a
little favorites video but with me
showing you how I do it as well so let's
jump into the video so starting with the
fresh face I jump into my bare minerals
true Oasis oil-free replenishing gel
cream just to add a bit of moisture to
my skin and then to add a bit of
luminosity to my skin I use the
fresh-faced instant glow Luminizer by
the brand fresh it has meadow foam and
seed oil in it and it smells like
cucumber it's so nice but it makes me
look really silver so then I spritz my
face a few times with the Mario Badescu
face grits and then I put some eye cream
under my eyes this one is by origins
it's the ginseng refreshing eye cream to
brighten and deep off the eyes then
jumping straight on to the foundation I
mixed my NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation with the Giorgio
Armani maestro glow just to give a
really nourishing light weight coverage
it's the perfect combination for me
because it adds a really nice and
luminosity to the skin and keeps looking
very natural I just like to make sure to
even out my skin tone that's my main
goal when applying foundation because I
don't like wearing anything too heavy on
the skin so both of these products are
really nice and lightweight then jumping
onto concealer I use the Naked skin
concealer by Urban Decay and I use it in
the shade media just to brighten up my
under eyes a little bit and the center
of my face or my chin down
my nose van on the center of my forehead
and then I just take my Beauty Blender
and blend all of that in this concealer
has been my favorite for a while now
because it's a really really thin
concealer really thin consistency but it
gives you the most incredible coverage
so all these products I am showing you
guys today are my absolute favorites all
right so I'd have to say my absolute go
to product of the moment is this
Clinique chubby stick in the shade curvy
contour I just put a line down my
cheekbones and I've blended in with my
102 silk finish rush by zoeva I then
also put it on the sides of my forehead
sort of just down my temple and this
just adds the most beautiful bronze eNOS
to your skin it doesn't give you too
much of a defined contour but it just is
the perfect shade to give you a really
really natural looking bronze to the
outer perimeter of your face I used this
all throughout Europe if I had any
product to put on my face I would have
added a little bit of this and some
mascara and that was basically all I
wore in your own but then the perfect
combination with the contour stick is
the chubby stick bag neck in an apple
this is my favorite blush tone ever it's
really really natural and it gives you a
really really beautiful Sheen to the
cheeks and it just looked makes you look
really flushed and healthy
and then finally along with those cream
contour products I use my whatsapp
highlighter from benefit and I just add
that to the highest points of my face
these through together are just the
perfect combinations on the skin it
really melts into your skin and it looks
so natural it's been my absolute go to
for the last few months I then take a
little bit of my Laura Mercier
translucent loose powder and I just take
that on a little brush and just run that
underneath my eyes and generally just in
my t-zone just to mattify the oily parts
of my face so on an everyday basis
that's often where I keep it I'll stop
there with my cream products and be
happy with that but for the purpose of
this video I will show you the powder
products that I've been loving as well
so just to intensify everything I've
done I take my Bahama Mama bronzer by
the balm and I will just continue to
contour my face and just add a little
bit more depth to my face
and then for blush a new favorite of
mine is the Marc Jacobs air blush in
5:04 kink and kisses it again like the
clinic chubby stick just adds a really
beautiful healthy flush to the cheeks
and it's very natural and then I'll take
one of my favorite highlighting shades
of the moment which is the Laura Mercier
candle glow luminizing palette and I
just grab a fan brush from zoeva and
just run that sort of all over the high
points of my face just to add that extra
glow and bring a really natural-looking
vibrancy and luminosity to the skin and
then I will also put that just in my
inner corners just to brighten up the
eyes as well and that's actually all I
do for my eyes I have eyelash extensions
on at the moment so I like to keep them
looking as natural as possible and then
of course I'll take my Maybelline master
brow palette in deep brown and just
lightly fill in my eyebrows nothing too
extreme just fill in any gaps and sort
of define the ends a little bit more I
generally just use a really light amount
of every product just so that I can
achieve the most natural look possible
because the main goal for me is to
actually just enhance my natural
features without changing them too much
and just make them look a little bit
more healthy when I'm feeling tired and
my skins of them dull I then run a light
layer of my benefits
Ready Set brow clear brow gel through my
brows just to set them in place all day
and I then take my Charlotte Tilbury lip
pencil in the shade iconic nude this is
my absolute favorite lip liner of all
time and then finally I take my clinic
lipstick or sort of liquid lipstick in
the shade one cake pot and I just put a
little bit of that in the center of my
lips and spread it around this product
is really lightweight and it just sits
really nicely on the skin and just gives
a really nice flush to your lips so that
is my current go-to makeup look it is
all the products that have been my
absolute favorites lately I hope you
