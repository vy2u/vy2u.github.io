you so much for watching today I'm doing
a video all about eyelash extensions so
I'm going to be doing sort of a
question/answer
slash review so my opinion on them I'll
answer a few questions that you guys
asked and yes so let's just get straight
into it so to begin this video I will
just give a bit of an explanation on
what what eyelash extensions are so they
are false lashes individual false lashes
stuck on to your natural lashes and they
last up to about a month and I guess the
process of what they do is as your
natural lashes fall out they will fall
out with them and once you have a few
gaps or you just want to get them fully
done up again you go in and you get in
fills so I might just look up a proper
definition of eyelash extensions because
I am shocking at explaining things
eyelash extensions is a practice that
enhances the length thickness and
fullness to natural eyelashes they
extend extensions the extensions may
consist of silk mink or synthetic hair
so when getting eyelash extensions you
do need to keep in mind that it's not
going to be the same as someone else's
everyone has different thickness
different amounts of lashes on their
eyes different styles and you know
lengths and all of that so when eyelash
extensions are applied they are going to
be applied differently so you might have
40 lashes on each eye as opposed to
someone that might have up to 80 lashes
per eye so it's never going to look the
same as someone else's so the beautician
will talk you through what will look
best on your eye shape and if your
eyelash is a really thin they suggest
not getting lashes that are too long or
too thick so that it won't drip on your
eyes that's what came annoyed me at
first was I always wanted lashes that
were the longest and the fullest that I
could get but I realized or even told me
that I couldn't
surely get lashes too big because they
were just drew so we figured out a shape
and style and they linked that I could
go and that's what we always do now so
yes so eyelashes last up to three to
four weeks depending on how well you
take care of them so if you wear a lot
of makeup on your eyelashes or if you
sleep quite heavily on your face maybe
you sleep with your eyelashes crushed I
guess um your eyelashes are going to
fall out quicker than someone that takes
a little bit better care of them so for
me they last up to four weeks because I
don't member skye on my lashes i don't
sleep on them i always sleep on my hands
so that my eyelashes aren't crushed i
wash them really carefully and i brushed
through them it's also weird taking care
of eyelashes but I like to take good
care of them so that they last longest
and I get the I get my money to a site
worth a film buff I get my money's worth
I guess so in maintaining your eyelashes
there is a process called the refills or
the in fills so once you notice that
they start thinning out you can go back
to your beautician and you can get paid
a certain amount of money however much
they charge and it's way less than the
original price but you get in feels and
then they redo the full set for you so
that they go back to their original
thickness and fullness so now that I've
got the general gist of what other two
exceptions are out of the way I will
talk a little bit about what I get so I
go to a beautician called Eva beautician
and she is a home salon so it's really
really comfortable you go to her house
she has a Beauty room and it's really
personal just one on one and it's super
super comfortable she has like a massage
for your legs and a blanket if it's cold
she plays really soothing music so this
video isn't sponsored at all I have been
going to Eva for about five years now so
I really trust her and I trust that you
guys will like what she does as well
so the eyelashes that I have on at the
moment are the silk lashes and they're
in
girl so you can get um different
varieties of lengths you can get
different curls you can get different
colors um so I have silk lashes with the
C curl and the I guess longest lash that
I have which is in the middle
I go from short to long to short I don't
go from short to long because that
doesn't suit my eye shape with hooded
eyelids because it drips on the end so
my longest lash is in the middle and
it's a 14 millimeter millimeter I think
I think that's what it's called but it's
not it's number 14 and and yes so it
goes from short to long to short it
doesn't go to as short as in the inner
corner but it's not as long as in the
middle because that's what shoots shoots
because that's what suits my eye shape
best so I'll leave eva's details down
below her number her website everything
like that so you can go have a look and
she does have a deal that if you say my
name if you say that you came from this
YouTube video you'll get it from 120
down to 80 so you'll get $40 off it's
awesome so because it's not sponsored or
anything for me I pay the normal price
but that's awesome for you guys so
you'll get $40 off so I'm now going to
answer some questions you guys left just
so that I can umm make sure that I cover
a wide variety of questions and also
answer the questions that were actually
asked and not blabber on about whatever
I'm talking about so so the first
question is can you still wear a lot of
eyeliner and eyeshadow and mascara with
eyelash extensions um so this are Bambi
uh no baby
so this question is yes I don't know you
can absolutely wear that eye makeup if
you want to but it again comes back to
whether or not you want your lashes to
last as long as possible so for me I
don't wear mascara I don't see the need
to I feel like these eyelets just give
me absolutely enough volume and length
and I'm not much of an eyeliner wearer
but I still do wear eye shadow because
that's up in the crease and that's super
easy to clean when you're cleaning your
face as opposed to eyeliner which is
right in the roots of your lashes and
you're gonna have to really get into the
lashes and clean it and you'll move your
lashes around and eventually sort of
loosen them and they'll fall out quicker
so yeah I suppose the answer to that
question is you can absolutely wear
whatever makeup you want but it's not
going to last as long and it's just it's
yet it's gonna make the eyelashes get a
little bit messy and so the next
question is when you get eyelash
extensions do they have absolutely not
so I can't feel them I guess I'm a bit
used to having lashes on because I stick
strip lashes on and have eyelash
extensions quite often so I'm used to
having sort of the feeling of something
on my lashes I guess but even when I
didn't wear eyelash extensions or hadn't
worn falsies I still couldn't really
feel them and be painless process they
don't hurt it might um I guess feel a
little bit heavy at first but you get
completely used to it you can go as
natural or as dramatic as you want I go
on the more dramatic side so that you
really can see them because I just love
big lashes but it's totally personal
preference if you have a more natural
set of lashes you're not even going to
feel them so no they don't hurt at all
so the next question is how where is it
that's sorry so the next question is how
do you remove your eyelash extensions so
there's two ways of going about it you
can go back to your beautician and you
can ask them to remove your lashes if
they don't sit well with you they're
uncomfortable and you don't like them or
you can just naturally let them fall out
with your natural lashes so the natural
process of our lashes is that they do
fall out and you
just grow back so that's just what
happens with the eyelash extensions they
sit on your natural lash and as your
natural lash falls out they fall out
with them so how often should you get
eyelash extensions um depending on your
beautician they will obviously advise
different things my beautician advises
that I get them three times and then
stop for a little bit and then I can get
them again just that way your natural
lashes have time to grow back strengthen
and just yet re sort of sort of recycle
okay recycle your lashes so yeah you
want you want to give your lashes some
time to grow back and get a little bit
strong before you go back and get a full
set again so again totally depends on
you you can get them in as many times as
you want but I advise just personally I
like to get them the full set maybe two
in fills afterwards so you have them for
one month two month three months you
have them about three months and then I
leave one month to let my lashes grow
back and re strengthen and then you can
go back and get them again so yeah it's
again it's all totally personal everyone
has different lashes everyone has
different preferences so if you have
stronger lashes go ahead and do them as
many times as you want that's just what
I do and that's how I keep my lashes
healthy in the process of having eyelash
extensions so the next question is what
are the drawbacks and what other
benefits so there are a heap of pros and
cons I guess the I'll start with the
cons so I can leave on the pros so the
cons of having a extensions are that
they do make your natural lashes fall
out everyone's really scared of that
because they think that your eyelashes
will never grow back but honestly every
time I have had eyelash extensions and
I've had them for about five years
hell I should have grown back to the
strength and the length that they
originally were everytime so it's as if
you've shaved your head and your hair is
going to grow back like honestly your
natural lashes will fall out a little
bit my never fully fall out I always
always have lashes left at the end and I
always have a good amount
at the end as never I'm never bald or
anything on my lash line but um yeah
they do thin out and they do I guess
have a lot I do have a lot less lashes
left at the end of my eyelash extension
experience I guess another drawback is
that it's harder to apply makeup so like
I said before you can't really wear a
winged liner or mascara you can but it
just makes it harder to sort of clean it
and wash your face and get rid of the
makeup afterwards and then it also does
and loosen the lashes and make it fall
out a lot quick and what are the
benefits um well the benefits are
obviously that you don't have to Emma
Skye you have luscious long lashes all
the time for up to a month or up to
wherever however long you want to wear
them for um so from so for me at the
moment I'm going to New Zealand and I'm
not going to have to wear any mascara I
what probably won't be wearing any
eyeshadow or anything and that's just
awesome because you just constantly have
these pretty long lashes you wake up
with them and they're long and luscious
and you go to sleep and they're lovely
luscious they're just they're just
really really easy when you're going
away so for me they're just perfect if
I'm going on a vacation and I don't want
to have to think about putting makeup on
in the morning I mean I always put a
little bit of concealer and Runza maybe
but it's just so awesome waking up and
feeling okay I could I'm cool I can just
go out right now so it's just a cool
feeling just having really pretty long
lashes all the time um yeah so that's
the biggest benefit I guess and yeah so
another personal benefit for me and for
those of you that wear glasses out there
is that my eyelashes don't touch my
lenses because I have the C curl which
means it's just the type of lash they
curl up with instead of more outwards
they don't touch the lenses of my
glasses so I can freely wear my glasses
and not be irritated or annoyed I can
blink I can do whatever I want
with shrimp lashes they do touch my eye
they do touch my glasses so that's
awesome with a lash extensions they're
always a little bit sure
strip lashes and so they are much easier
to wear with your glasses and they don't
irritate they don't annoy and they don't
touch the lenses which is the most
frustrating thing ever so you can blink
you can just go about your day normally
if you wear glasses and it just has a
nice just nice you probably can't see
because of the ring light but it's just
nice you have nice big eyes underneath
your glasses because of the allergy
extensions so yeah so yeah that's all I
have to say about the eyelash extensions
um if you guys do have any more
questions that I didn't answer in this
video make sure you leave questions down
below and I'll try to answer them I'm
not sure sometimes why it happens but
sometimes I can't reply to a lot of your
questions and because it only gives me
the option to do the thumbs up thumbs
down so I'm not sure if that's because
you're not subscribed to my channel
that's what I've heard I think if you're
not subscribed and you comment I can't
reply to you I don't know if that's true
that's what I've just heard or I looked
up and that's what it said but um yeah

otherwise yet if you are interested in
asking more questions make sure you
