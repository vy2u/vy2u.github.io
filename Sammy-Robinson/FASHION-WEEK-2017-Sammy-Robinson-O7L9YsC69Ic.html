camera so much better I'm bringing this
camera to Fashion Week days why we have
switched over for this vlog I just faked
and in case you're wondering I did quite
a few layers because it's supposed to
last whole week and I wanted to be quite
dark and there's focusing issues are
going to annoy me but you know I have
gotten used to that beginning to pack my
bags I've got my suitcase my carry-on my
toiletries down there I've got all the
shoes that I'm packing just here and
then these are on my outfit for Fashion
Week and then all my bags so and then
lastly that's my makeup and then I've
got all my other casual clothes just
here as well so packing is coming along
well I'm okay with all my outfits they
don't fit that well but I am had a
massive ordeal with my outfits
unfortunately what I thought I was going
to be wearing never arrived
it's supposed to be arriving on Monday
so I made a huge order on the iconic
very last minute and arrived yesterday
morning and I'm going to Fashion Week
tomorrow morning so the iconic is
amazing in Australia for getting your
orders to really really quickly and I
think it came within sort of six hours
which is just so lucky that there is a
service like that because otherwise I
would have nothing to wear that's
traumatic I obviously would have
something to wear I've got a closet full
of clothes but I wouldn't wear something
different
cos I'm not exactly 100% happy with all
my outfits but I'm lucky considering I
had nothing a day ago and I've managed
to scrape together five outfits for the
five days I've just got my stuff there
that I am editing I've got my vlog that
I wanna get up by Sunday hopefully I'll
get up by Sunday which is tomorrow and I
will be at Fashion Week so I hope to get
that done today but I've still got a lot
of packing in things to get done so I'm
staying in the Swiss hotel in the city
with all the Maybelline girls moon squad
and
going tomorrow at 10:30 which is kind of
a shame because it's Mother's Day
tomorrow so I'll be missing mum
tomorrow's show is danly its opening
shows only show of the whole day and
then all of the rest of them start
Monday and then go till Thursday good
morning guys
so I just woke up and it is 9:30 a.m. I
thought thought I'd let myself have a
sleep in because I've got Paul weaken
but there's a good full week of early
mornings and that happens 6:00 a.m.
morning so I'll have one last look and
I'm getting picked up at 10:00 and it's
9:40 so I just need to pop some comfy
clothes on and then head to our hotel
and then we're getting out here and
makeup done which is very nice but I
have to worry about what's happening
here we have some all packed ready to go
and I'm actually very excited it's gonna
be a good work stay hydrated kids thank
you okay so I'll go to rush rush back
upstairs to meet everyone but I thought
I would show you guys a quick little
tour it's a really cute little sweet the
big bad lovely open windows this is the
second top floor so it's so high up and
so it's really really nice little sweet
welcome Sammy Robinson
and then this is a little boss room must
be shower with me hi down in my room now
I've had my hair and my makeup done I've
just gone for a simple high bun and I
thought that's what would suit my outfit
the best so I'm just currently uploading
a video just before I go back upstairs
I've got about 20 minutes and then we'll
all be leaving first outfit I don't
really know if I like it but something I
can really do about it now so I will
work with what I've got and hopefully
just a tall bit too big so I hope to
have to figure out a way that it fits me
all right I'm sure it'll be okay so
we're on our way to the Daily Show and
the weather is not looking at best
and unfortunately the show is outside
and I think this is one of the images
like outside not on the cover so the
opening show at the Opera House is going
to be so beautiful but it is I think
that they planned because it's been such
beautiful weather lately for it to be
you know a nice afternoon
Gummy's yeah or perhaps experienced but
I don't think it's gonna be like that
this is a pretty good drink you know to
prove the Corollas
we're backstage at the Maybelline makeup
stations the girls are getting their
makeup and hair done and it's honest one
I just in opera hostage it's amazing and
his Nigel I'm looking here
oh hi like this hi everyone how are you
guys I'm doing good okay Bailey yeah
yeah yeah
darling mrs. Thomas coming I feel the
women I'm Anna I'm Nina
Oh
I've been going
loud whistling my
so I'm just lying on my hotel bed
obviously I'm not at the show anymore I
thought I would just update you guys
after that little montage of Fashion
Week day one it was so amazing it dearly
came up with some beautiful pieces of
clothing I was in love with basically
all of it so it was a very good start to
Fashion Week I am it probably will be
one of my favorite shows I'd say but
yeah me and Katya though we were getting
photo taken down the bottom because sort
of when you go to Fashion Week people
stop you for photos and we canvassed as
so late and other people had taken our
seats and I was a bit embarrassing we
had to like squish in and find the spot
and every single other person had sat
down so that was a little bit
embarrassing you know but yeah it was it
was fine everyone was primary just
squishing in everywhere so Palestine we
have about 10 minutes just to kill up
here I've changed we're going to go out
for dinner now I've just uploaded my
vlog for you guy is my son Burnett
weekly vlog today we're going to go out
for dinner and have a really early one
tonight it's only 5:30 so we're going to
hopefully be back by like I'd say like
I'd say we'll be back by like 8:00 and
then which is a really nice fairly night
because grab the big day tomorrow it
didn't really get much of an outfit shot
though it's all inserts and photos here

check in with you guys later and yeah
update you on anything obviously so this
is tonight comfy outfit I put this top
on which I'm not sure I will least list
a tumble over jeans again literally have
no idea if so old and I'm pretty sure I
just cut holes in them myself but I've
got my Jovan Chi slides on and my YSL
bag
day two Fashion Week or technically day
one this is day one of proper shows I
did my makeup this morning just because
I woke up so early and I was bored so I
just did that really quickly and then I
got my hair done and I slick today I'm
wearing a dress Truman Show no joy a bag
from Chloe and shoes from white box
boutique oh yeah so we just arrived at
carriage so just arrived at
Carriageworks Korea had a few interviews
to do with live with say Furman so we

beautiful day today released sunny but

wear out today and got some sort of like
a baby doll look we flushed was she
we're back in the hotel now we only had
the one show this morning and I was in a
pretty bad spot to show you guys any of
the runway really so I took a little bit
of footage but didn't really get all
that much we're all going to quickly get
changed now and we're having a master
class is Nigel which is the director of
Maybelline makeup he's going to show

are we really cool we've all come back
to the hotel because they just get in
