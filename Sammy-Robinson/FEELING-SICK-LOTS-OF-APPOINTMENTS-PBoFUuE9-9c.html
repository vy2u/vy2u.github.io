pretty much the first time I'm leaving
the house I'm going to visit Cardiacs

want to do a beer before both of us

sorry what's that how exciting so
excited of the sauna is detoxification
weight loss anti-aging chronic
conditions like helps like if you've got
like chronic conditions you know skin
health and we investing pain relief
stress reduction and sleeping like helps
with sleeping I really need that because
because I've been sick I haven't been
sleeping well I'll let you know if it
actually works because I've been
sleeping so badly this whole week if I
sleep well tonight I've been sleeping so
well this whole week and I've been going
to the sauna everyday are you what is
your name
I have never seen anything they stopped
the baby chefs so cool so this is the
sauna that will be sitting in and we've
got our water bottles so when I was at
the IMP red sauna
I bought this collagen and antioxidant
syrup from the Beauty chef which I've
had this before and I loved it I'm
trying collagen so I'm gonna fill up my
drink bottle with probably some of this
one I'm gonna do a shot of apple cider
vinegar and then I'm also going to do a
little health shot what I've put in here
is immunity powder turmeric and much
green tea a shot of everything and
drinking lots of water because I'm
trying to stay hydrated after the sauna
and I've put the dishwasher on it so if
you're wondering what that noise is
religion I just put a little bit and I'm
also gonna put a bit of the antioxidant
one in there because I'm sick and I need
everything I think earth and
antioxidants are so good for your body
good morning guys it's the next day I am
Telling You I I feel so safe a lot of
appointments today so I thought I better
just do them because then I can get them
all done before Pilate all done for its
21st and feel pretty again I haven't
heard anything done in months and I just
it'll be nice to have a bit of a part of
the day even though I'm not feeling that
well and I'm just giving myself the day
off today because
I needed to get a lot of stuff done even
packed me off to Bali but it's up in
Smith today that I need to get lots of
work done we're just fine I can get it
done tomorrow
the first stop is laser I got a laser
and get my hair left and then I've got
my hair and I'm probably going to get my
nails and etc maybe get breakfast with
Nick I thought I would tell you as well
why I remember that what is on my lips
is my sports girl that chalk in vertigo
I think that's what's called were to go
still obsessed with it still wear it all
the time
all right so when back in the car now
I'm going to go pick up Nikolas have a
quick breakfast with him because
Thursday's is his day off and then I'm
gonna go get my hair done
Hey
dog dukey yeah baby you look very
comfortable okay now I'm off to get my
hair done
breakfast was delicious but I'm very
full I would had my hair dyed like six
months may have had it blow waved like
once or twice but haven't had it turned
or cut and it is looking brassy so I'm
keen all right this camera keeps sliding
all over the place
okay so I'm back done from the
hairdresser's we just turned it down a
bit because it was getting super brassy
and quite yellow say it's a little
darker and a little
ICEA and I love it so I go to pop a bar
if any of you guys are wondering I've
been that to him if he is you guys
remember when I had my tiny little short
blonde Bob that's where I went and he
still does my honey hair so yes anymore
I just made a large delivery from the
spot market some Mateen butcher so I
thought I'd show you gay so I got this
is so delicious green tea with a
kombucha and I got a stress reliever tea
because I have been feeling the stress
lately I really have no idea what this
is it's a code by a bubble it says it's
a living superfood containing billions
of beneficial organisms to recharge the
digestion
it says digestion is the essence of
health and well-being beneficial gut
organisms are the key to good digestion
but lifestyle choices may affect this
precious life force bio Bible offers a
proactive bio balancing solution so far
and then I stocked up on 12 which is
just to keep in my fridge I got apple
crisp
hibiscus kiss raspberry lemonade and
ginger and lemon this one is my favorite
this is my all-time favorite snack
banana with peanut butter chia seeds on
corn things with kombucha Father's Day
that totally failed I just got a spray
tan for tomorrow because Holly's 21st is
tomorrow which I'm so excited for it's
gonna be such fun we're going on a boat
gonna be so fancy she's gonna look so
beautiful
