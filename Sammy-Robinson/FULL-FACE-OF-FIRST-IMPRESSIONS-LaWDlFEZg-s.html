the stuff on my table outside on my
table where I put all my makeup so I get
sent a whole bunch of stuff which I'm
very lucky for and I always leave it
outside on the table in my dining room
until i reorganize it and so I go
through all my stuff and having a look
together it inspires I'm just what Oh
whack man so I thought why don't I do a
separation video I haven't done one of
these in so long and I even has like
brushes some first impressions in books
so so soft so I was like I've been doing
first impressions and I'm not going to
cheat because I'm going to do a first
impressions on brushes as well all of
this stuff is first impressions except
this I shaded palette as well which it's
new but I had one before and I just
watched it with my fingers
this is ages ago this is months ago so
this is beautiful pigment and that's all
I know about it I haven't tried it on my
hives and then I don't have a full face
of other things as well that I'd like to
try I don't like watching these videos
when they go on for too long there so
I'm going to be really precise and get
to the point really quickly and tell you
whether I like the products or not I
don't know what this shirt looks very
good for this video I feel like I look a
little bit underdressed
now I'm getting changed Beauty pack so
let us begin this part here is the
Burberry and nude radiance number one
first glow of luminous fluid base
beautiful packaging as you would expect
because Barbara is very beautiful brand
already cleanse and moisturize my skin
as always so let's do this
oh wow wow beautiful it just has a
really radiance on my skin love it I
have this josie maran vibrancy
foundation and whenever what it was a
little too like to me so now that I'm
not fake tennyson was the perfect
opportunity to try it out could still be
a little too light but we'll just work
with it I'm going in with just a spot
girl brush set it's the rose gold with
the white handles
they look excuse my little doggie in the
background look absolutely beautiful
they look so soft and the hairs are just
so soft so I'm keen to try these out
I'm going to take the flat top kabuki
brush and blend that into my skin
actually seems like it's doing a really
good job I've been back into using
kabuki and brushes to blend in my
foundation just gets the job done so
quickly this foundation is so beautiful
it's definitely very radiant so not for
oily skin types going to be a challenge
concealer without a Beauty Blender but
I'm going to give it a go unfortunately
I don't have a new concealer that I can
use but this NARS creamy concealer is
still very new to me and if that's not a
first first impression I'm still very
unsure whether I like it
so I'll be taking this can fill up with
the foundation brush that comes in the
set conceal the veins on my eyes Russ is
actually really nice at getting into all
the small areas could your Beauty
Blender so big I can't really get in my
inner corner but this is actually doing
really good job and I take the same
concealer and concealed underneath my
nose and my chin okay so while we're on
the cream products before I set anything
down I don't feel like I need any more
highlight because I feel like I'm
looking a bit like a greaseball but I
have always wanted to try out this
benefit Sunbeam golden bronze complexion
highlighter I don't know why I would try
this because it just seems like be my
perfect product to me see a little gold
bottle and basically I see me just paint
it onto your face I'm just going to use
my finger to blend that in oh that's
gorgeous
just going to put it on all the high
points of my face my collarbone is
because my collarbones are out
oh yes
and I'll mention ah ah give it to me
okay now I'm going to take the big
powder brush that was provided in the
set and the only power I haven't tried
which I don't remember trying and my
husband don't think I have is the
professional of shine vanishing pro
powder comes in a little thing like this
I suppose you just tip the power into
the lid set my under eyes and my eyelids
everything has been a positive so let's
not jinx it okay so I'm going to be
coming onto the eyes now I'm going to
take the I shaded palate and I think
it's only fair that using this I'm going
to try out their eye primer so I'm just
going to draw it on my lids and a little
bit into my crease kind of translucent
this would be great to use if you're
using a shimmery product or like a
pigment because sticking anything on to
this would just make it so so intense
well I'm just going to use my fingers to
Pat that down I'm going to treat a
little bit with my eye shadow brushes
just because the I set the eye brushes
that come with that set you and have
sort of a few small ones so oh you do
them use a few other ones as well so
accessory as heck is vanilla I'm going
to set down at the eye primer with that
shade first impressions they are very
pigmented like a white usually doesn't
show up that much on me okay I think
it's time to tie the hair up okay is
that the first color I'm going to be
jumping into is caramel which is the
center shade just here and we'll be
running that through my crease as my
transition shade can you see how
pigmented manages oh my gosh that is
intense I haven't picked up that much of
the products one so so impressed with
that they're also very very easy to
blend and it doesn't take much work at
all to blend the shadows
they said I'll be deep in that shade up
I'm just going to go into this changes
here and run that through exactly the
same spots just going to add a little
bit more depth because it's a little one
or two shades darker so now for the star
of the show I'm going to take my flat
shader brush from the brush set and I'm
going to take this gorgeous iron shade
because how could I not I'm going to
pack that on my lid you're kidding Suzi
these brushes are so soft as well okay
so once I packed the color down going to
go back into my blending brush
picking up caramel again I'm just going
to diffuse that already gorgeous
flamie shade think it a little bit more
wearable I do have another sports go one
which is called a smokey eye shadow
palette and this one has a lot darker
shades and I definitely kept the Sun in
the middle think I smoking up a little
bit of this and just like really deepen
up the brownie areas
this shows adorable in the smokey eye
shadow palette okay now I think all of
these I'm going to dip into the lower
lash line so I think I might take chalk
which is this gorgeous bronzer shade
down the bottom and this is on the shade
brush from the kit connecting it to the
other lesson
and then taking pancake I'm going to be
running that on my inner corner okay so
from the SCARA
actually had quite a few scars that I
hadn't tried but this one caught my eye
cos in la belle told me her favorite
borrows Urban Decay perversion one and I
hadn't tried it so I don't know I just
put it away without trying it so let's
give this one a shot okay so it's a very
soft soft brush which makes it really
easy to create a Shazz I hate this
brushes and love that
oh that mascara is beautiful and that's
all you but not copy if you want to need
a new eye reverence which I haven't
tried but haven't tried in a long time
is the gimme brow and number three and C
Sigma hair back Alex it's a very pale he
done tried all the eyebrow products in
my collection except for this one which
I think I've tried a long time ago but I
don't remember this will set your brows
down and then also tint them could be so
great to everyday use when you don't
want to fill in your brows you just want
to give them a bit of color and make
them a little bit fuller very impressed
with that that's my surprise for me I
love the things that I've our products
and my favorite eyebrow products at the
moment I would say okay so for bronzer
I've got this hourglass ambient diffused
bronze light now I've used a lot of
the--and the apalis from hourglass but
never this shade and that just looks so
interesting to me because I totally get
how that's a bronzer but interesting
Rhonda and I really regret that I just
did my eyebrows tears because now
they're I'm going to a messed up but
anyway I'm going to be taking the bronze
brush from Sportsgirl
and just sort of swirling that in that
around interesting color
but it's just very interesting comment
already well it's very nice and
pigmented very different color and use
the runs of this color before I'm not
sure because if the marbling if it's
made it look kind of bit patchy of my
skin undecided lush for me to be trying
out this color block but it doesn't have
a name but um it looks like that and
definitely does not suit his eye makeup
moving on from the wash last step is lip
so I'm going to take one of these
burglary and liquid it lip velvet I've
got the shades light nude and form
had those lines there for ages let's
give it go oh that color is right up my
alley oh my god they're so soft and you
would hope but I'm pretty sure this
would be very expensive that color is
everything pays bevery fawn I tell you
well and that is literally the last step
to this makeup look like yes the eyes
ended up matching the lips really nicely
all in all I was very lucky and I got a
very successful bunch of products this
was a fine I mean look at those gorgeous
shades and look at the price of this
eyeshadow palette and how could you not
