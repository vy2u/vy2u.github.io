decided to vlog so instead of film just
a normal video I'm going to sort of take
you on a on a date in my life I guess um
I was going to film a Q&amp;amp;A today just
because I posted on Instagram and asked
you guys to ask me questions and I was
going to film a Q&amp;amp;A but I thought I
would just log instead and then
throughout the vlog I guess I could
answer some questions like if it gets
boring towards the end of the day and
I'm not doing anything that I can just
sort of sit down and answer some
questions so I don't know we'll see how
we go um so far all I know I'm doing is
going to do the bondi to bronte walk
with my friend Emma and then we're
trying out a new cafe in Bondi that
she's been wanting to try out um yeah so
sorry if the cab was shaking oh my god
it's so heavy
um yeah so I'll just show you my outfit
I'm wearing an added US hat a just a
stripy singlet I'm wearing some gym
pants my Nike slides and these gym pants
are cool because they've got like the
things down the side which I like a bit
of striping jump fly fly kicks yeah so
that's my outfit um I'm just about to go
make myself some breakfast um sorry and
yeah so I'm probably Emma's on her
up here come here you're a very good boy
you know that but ticket just anything
good so avocado of salt pepper balsamic
actually on snapchat one of your time
gonna use balsamic glaze I use it now
it's delicious Henry wait I need a water
bottle guys this camera is so heavy my
shoulders and you know like bulk after
this oh do you guys wanna see a bit of a
flat talk hmmm this is my deck that's
the hub Brooke I love my toast as you
can see down the bottom really charcoal
look i'm SMF letters um like I love my
bacon really crispy on my toast really
charcoal I think I just love the taste
of that I love that girl
look at you
if you guys are wondering I'm wearing
velvet teddy by Mac on my lips I always
wear this so like if I never answer what
I'm wearing it's probably velvet teddy
some of the starts are a bit like care
for usual smell because I really this is
going to pull instantly I just know it
isn't it all soup of the day or smoked
resultant ancho pepper calamari so a box
right now this is Emma
getting
just got back from our mini tiny walk we
only ended up walking across Bondi Beach
to get to North Monday and then we went
to where did we go
Beatles went to speedos and then yeah so
I had abakada I was delicious and we
both were craving the chip scene I put
it in her craving chips and though these
girls next to us and they didn't finish
their chips and so Emma's told them stop
stole the bowl of chips and put on a
thing thinking they left and they were
just standing there looking at us oh
because will you just let eating my
chips it's probably really dirty but
girl's got to do what she's got to do
put some chilies right a big girl's
gotta eat
um yeah so then we just had a stroll
around one day I grow coffee and ember
Messina almost um what flavor did you
get it called breakfast of champions
myself top charm films it's like honey
and what mile or something and you eyes
a Milo and cereal YUM oh yeah so not
sure if we're gonna see a movie tonight
or she has coke perfume I think it's
really perfect timing because that we
just used as our parking um timing but
also when there's just clouded over it's
but really cold and windy outside so
it's like perfect time to leave because
we got really cold
excuse me while I enjoy it please show
funding my friend and I that I've been
obsessing over go in a speedo I think
both wait she's there right now is she
actually oh my god there's a dog lady a
dog oh that is the cutest thing I have
ever seen in my entire life never follow
me I love it part um OH
Hey
bye let's go for a walk around mmm so
I'm not really doing anything at the
moment I'm just at home chilling now I
probably should look at you anyway
because I probably have like an
assignment to you really soon but you
know when you just don't look because
you're like you're like I don't know if
I don't look that you just don't hurt
her so sorry if this camera like goes
down I'm trying to clean on myself
trying to lean on myself is you so handy
but yes stay still so beautiful I'm on
holidays at limits so I have two weeks
off from uni and I really haven't been
given a shift till Friday and it's
Wednesday so I don't really have
anything to do this week which is so
bizarre because I mean I can feel
obviously I still have my youtube to do
but I feel like I should talk more but
like I don't really know what to say
yeah so what are things happening in my
life that I need to update you guys on
hmm well I know if you follow me on
Instagram which if you don't it's Sammy
Robinson with three M's I'll leave it
down below or on the screen if I figure
out how to have inter probably words I
don't expect it to be on the screen but
yes I've signed with Max connectors
which is so exciting because they're
like the nicest people and it's just
like one big family it's awesome so I'm
excited to meet all of them yeah so
that's exciting news that's probably the
only really new thing
in my life at the moment which is so
annoying I kind of want to just go
traveling and just like vlog and travel
and just go away for a little while like
I'm not one of those I'm not one of
those girls I could go travelling for
ages cause I'm a bit of a homebody but I
mean I would like to go away for a few
weeks or like a month and just just
travel around and vlog it and just and
and no we're crazy just like because I
have a house in foster I love just going
to the beach and relaxing and just
finding cute places like that to hang
out so yeah I don't know I feel like in
summer holidays I might do something
like that but depends what's happening
in my life I guess and who I'm with
it doesn't make sense like if people
would come with me or if oh girl I would
never go alone I'd want to go with
people so depends on people's jobs and
what people are doing at the time I
suppose just I would love to go to Bali
as well I really want to go to Bali
I love Bali I've been ages ago and I
just I just love how relaxing it is in
the Feliz and want to go there someone
take me someone take me to Bali
um so I'm going to finish my vlog here I
was gonna vlog later on going to the
movies and going out but I think it's
going to be too long because I have
quite a lot of footage already so yeah
so I hope you guys have enjoyed this
vlog and I will see you in my next video
