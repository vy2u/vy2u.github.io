have your birthday today I found two
this coral makeup look super easy to
recreate so if you like what you see so
I just applied my clinic moisturizing
gel on my napoleon paris primer and my
L'Oreal Lumi magique foundation off
camera then i went in with my bare
minerals 5 in one eye primer and just
put that all over my eyelids and rubbed
it in ident of my NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and I just put that all over my
eyelid just to create a nice bright base
for my eyeshadows later once i've
messily applied that all over my eyelid
I'll go in with my concealer brush I
know just to fuse the edges and then
I'll be going into my Too Faced natural
eyes palette and taking the shade nudie
just as a transition shade afterwards
I'll take this almay eyeshadow in the
shade peach fuzz and I'm just gonna run
that through the same spot that we put
the shade nudie gonna take it along
I'm then gonna go in with this American
Idol a baked eyeshadow in the shade
golden poppy on a smaller tapered
blending brush and just putting that
through the socket I'm just picking up
more product as I go and just building
up the color just to intensify the look
then picking up the shade burgundy from
the same eyeshadow line I'm gonna take
it on a smaller brush and just run that
more precisely through the socket right
after you're happy with the color payoff
just take your blending brush and just
diffuse all the edges and then I'm going
in with this Mac pigment in the shade
melon and I'm just running that all over
my eyelid
if you want to create a more intense
color just spray or wet your brush
before you dip it into the pigment and
it will have a much more vibrant to
color hair once again I'm taking my
blending brush and just blending it all
together to brighten up the eye look I'm
taking a silk teddy and I'm just placing
that on the center of my eyelid and on
my inner tear ducts and then I'm taking
my L'Oreal full slash wings and I'm just
applying a credit of his guards my top
and bottom lashes before I put on my
falsies
so today I'm using the Ardell and
natural lashes and I'm just putting them
on these are a really nice
natural-looking lash but still very
glamorous at the same time and then I'm
going back into the almay shadow that we
originally picked up and I'm just
diffusing all the edges I'm going in
with two concealers today so I'm
starting off with this Maybelline age
rewind concealer for dark circles it has
a pink undertone so it will counteract
all the blue tones under your eyes and
I'm just brightening up the center of
your face as well and then I'm taking my
max its concealer in NC 30 and I'm just
placing that and just brightening up the
center of the forehead as well I'm then
taking my damp Beauty Blender and I'm
just blending all that concealer and
then going into my AC on top I think it
and I'm picking up these two shades and
just setting all the concealer in place
because do you then wetting the brush
once again I'm dipping it into the Mac
pigment in melon and I'm just running
that under my lash line and then going
back in with the mascara and just
applying a light coat on top of that
again I'm picking up the shades already
from the Too Faced natural eyes palette
and I'm just highlighting my brow bone
and my inner tear-duct again and then
I'm picking up the NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and just putting it on my waterline
to brighten up my eyes so to set the
rest of my face I'm taking this Smashbox
powder and I'm just running around the
outer perimeter of my face just
everywhere that we do the highlight
and then to give myself a bronzed glow
I'm taking this Napoleon
bronze Patrol bronzer and I'm just
placing that in all the spots that you'd
want to bronze up your skin and then to
contour I'm taking this Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer and just
applying that to all their contour spots
on my face so my cheekbones my temples
my jawline and my nose and of course to
give my skin a nice so I'm taking two
lipsticks I'll start off with
Maybelline's lipstick in coral fever
and then because I found that to share
and then going in with Rimmel London's
kiss me and I'm just running that right
over top so after you're finished with
your lipstick your look is complete if
