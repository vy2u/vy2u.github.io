channel so today's video is going to be
a full face of first impressions or sort
of a full face of new makeup may or may
not have swatched a few of these things
on my head and dab it a little bit with
them but um yeah it's pretty much a full
phase of first impressions I really
don't know how they perform though this
video is in collaboration with sports
girl they had recently and I know I'm a
little bit late to the bandwagon but
they had their love your body week which
I am wearing English shirt today
basically they teamed up with the
butterfly foundation to spread awareness
of body image and body shaming and
encouraging everyone just to love their
body for the way it is and not to be
ashamed of that everyone and I mean
everyone even someone that you think has
the most perfect body in the world is
self-conscious about their body and
self-conscious about certain aspects of
their body they truly do feel that our
body does not define us we were given
one body we were given that body for a
reason and we shouldn't just want to
change it because of the way other
people look you need to learn to love
that body that you were given because
it's yours and no one else has that
there is literally no one else in the
world that is exactly the same as you
even identical twins completely
different when you get to know them so
for me I kind of realized that I had to
stop wasting time comparing myself to
other people and just spend that time
I'm learning to love myself for what
I've got because this is what I'm gonna
have for the rest of my life there is
literally no point in me wasting at that
one life time that I get hating myself
for hating my body and every single
person is completely beautiful in their
own way and it'd be boring if everyone
was the same you know I have a few
sports go products in here to bring you
as well and as well as a whole bunch of
other things like the Fenty beauty
sticks and things like that so if you
guys want to see this first impressions
video then just keep on watching I'm
gonna begin by using the Stila one-step
prime prep smoothes and nourishes I've
actually never used a still primer
before so it feels quite moisturizing oh
wow that feels amazing oh my god that
was so refreshing it was like really
cooling and sort of like a jelly like
it was like a jelly-like consistency so
then along with these steel uh primer I
also got sympathy steel our foundations
and I have three shades I've got fair
buff which both seems to be the most
like my shade and then I've got this
really really dark I'm here called ten
thirteen and the reason I've chosen the
darkest well it's because I've got these
awesome drops from Sportsgirl
and I've actually never tried these
custom enhancer drops that sort of
changed the shade of your foundation so
I'm really excited to try this out I'm
going to use obviously the lighter ones
cuz this one's gonna be way too dark for
me and we'll see how it goes so like in
winter when you're pale you use the
white ones and then the more times you
can summer use the darker ones
so this one is how it looks by itself
definitely a perfect match I'd say take
the rest of the thing on the lid it's
gonna put that on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna add quite a bit I think do
you how this goes
oh my god
that is awesome look at that
that is so cool
I still do think that'll be a little too
dark though so I'm gonna add a little
more sorry you can't say that's perfect
so this is the foundation with the
custom drops that's so cool it actually
works I'm gonna clear this one off all
right now let's start it around my face
and see how this goes
I've also never tried this foundation
before so this is sort of like a first
impressions but obviously I'm not going
to judge the foundation of this
impression because it's been mixed it's
been altered so oh but it is nice blend
super easily a really nice finish so far
I went from using like a really dark
foundation so this is really cool I've
got patchy fake tan on my neck that's
not cute look at Bambi Bambi what are
you doing we played with Henry okay so I
don't have another concealer to use so
I'm just gonna use my naked skin by
urban decay and I'll be right back now
that the concealer is on I'm gonna be
trying out the Born This Way
if the areal setting powder by two-faced
two-faced always has the cutest
packaging though oh I'm going to bake my
under eyes and with this and I'm just
gonna dip in with my Beauty Blender and
just
wow that looks smooth so smooth but I
just realized I actually do have an you
conceal except for God I had this one by
Fanty but too late now so I'm not going
to use that but I am going to use these
two shades this one is maca and this one
is trip in which no it seems like it's
an aluminized
blush that is what it looks like
that is the shade just there
alright let's give this a go I'm just
gonna draw it directly onto my face like
it's really not that buttery like it's
quite stiff I felt this is gonna be like
impossible to blend okay it actually
wasn't that hard to blend okay so it
wasn't too bad if I'm comparing it to my
clinic chubby stick I hate it but um
I just have a lot more I do have a lot
more cream contour products that blend
just so much easier than that and that
was just quite it was grabby and I had
to really push it in but I mean it looks
quite nice now that it's done but um I
probably wouldn't reach for it again so
it's like a pink highlight now I'm not
using that sorry now I'm gonna take a
little bit more of that translucent
powder and I'm just gonna lightly dust
that definitely makes my skin look quite
flawless do I like it more than my Laura
Mercier undecided but now I'm gonna move
on to this palette which is called the
complexion perfection face and cheek
palette by Sportsgirl and it's got a
bunch of blushes and highlighters so I'm
gonna use this palette for my blush and
my highlight and then I've got this
palette as well which I couldn't decide
between so I'm just gonna use both but
I'll use this one mainly on my eyes cuz
this is more of an eyeshadow palette -
these are the
we're gonna be working with today oh I'm
gonna be taking this bronzer here just
on a nice big fluffy brush and see how
we go
that's quite a nice shade because it's
not too often bronzers not contour
powders are quite orangey whereas this
one is like a really nice just brown I
guess I loved that that I almost reminds
me a lot of the hoola rooms of my
benefit so they're moving onto this
palette I think it's such a beautiful
palette and I love that it has a huge
mirror in it I'm gonna begin with blush
and my favorite blush shades ever our
baby pink shades so I'm gonna take this
guy just in the middle we might mix I
might make a little bit of peach
actually these two just here Sportsgirl
highlighters have the most beautiful
formula and these cheek products have
exactly the same feel they've got
they've just got really really buttery
formula is that just really melt into
the skin really nicely I mean I'm not
even surprised I know that the sports
girls formulas are really beautiful okay
and now for highlight this is gonna be
exciting I already know this is gonna be
amazing so I'm gonna jump into these two
shades here I like come on I don't know
what is in sports girls highlighters but
they are just like look there's nothing
on my cheek
insane oh I don't like my highlighters
to be too intense and glittery well this
is amazing because it's not glittery
like it's almost that Sheen just really
melts in this one I probably put a
little too much oh come on
keep it slow little on my forehead okay
what is she doing jump back into that
when I do my eyes to do my inner tear
ducts and things freeze this open
because I'm inspired by the front cover
I'm gonna go for a rosy look so I'm
gonna go down the side here and use
these three and maybe like that one
there okay so to begin the look I'm
gonna take this guy right yeah okay so
taking her to let me to run that through
my crease on a little bit more of a
tapered blending brush I'm gonna jump
into eternal which is this brown shade
just up here and this is gonna go on the
outer be
we blend out the edges I'm just going to
continue to pick up a turn home and just
really deepen up the outer be almost
just like kind of stab my eye there and
then I just like use like wiggle
emotions
I don't blend it all that much because
otherwise it goes way too far
I guess further than I want it to go
it's got a highlight what is going on we
really sports girl highlights
I like another level they take that
eternal shade and I'm gonna run it on my
lower lash line now I think I don't know
whether to add thorn or bloom to the lid
I think I'm gonna go thorn
it's beautiful back in there color down
here
oh
wish I was better at makeup like I
always know that these videos so bad to
you guys because I'm really trying we're
like how do we get it to look so awesome
you know now jumping back into this
palette I'm going to pick up candy this
ones County and put that on me in a tear
ducts
you know just adding a little bit of
mascara to my bottom lashes okay so now
onto the eyebrows I'm going to be trying
out this foolproof brow powder by
benefit I've never I've personally ever
seen this before how how about you guys
in the shape of the brow at the front of
my brows I never really used powder so
this will be interesting
okay so I've lightly feathered in the
front bits now I'm gonna try out the doc
a bit so that's this bit just here a
really cool concept if you guys struggle
with your brows I personally just don't
like powders that much just because I
prefer pencils I think they get the job
done a lot quicker but I mean that was
really easy and I thought it was very it
was very clever concept and now the last
step for the look is a lips so I'm going
to start out with thought sent a whole
bunch of the NARS precision lip liners
and this one is in the shade it doesn't
have a shade on it so maybe it's called
precision lipliner I highly doubt it
though but it's just that really nice
rosy nudie shade that was super creamy
super easy to use very impressed not the
biggest fan of lip pencils cuz I never
have a sharpener on me but when you do
have a sharpener it gives you the best
application and now I'm gonna go over
the top with my cap one day liquid
lipstick in Ophelia and then to finish
off the look I'm going to use the Marc
Jacobs perfecting her crown setting mist
I came out a bit weird and that is the
final book the light is coming in okay
pull you over here a little bit third
day you guys have enjoyed this video
I've had so much fun playing
and everything actually ended up being a
massive success Fenty sticks that was
just I mean you guys probably know that
I love my cream products like I'm so
into cream highlighting and cream
contouring but that just did not live up
to the hype at all for me anyway
otherwise I hope that you guys have
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
