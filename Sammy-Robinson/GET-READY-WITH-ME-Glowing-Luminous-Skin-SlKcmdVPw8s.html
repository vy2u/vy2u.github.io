so excuse this wet mop on my head it
does a few emails and whilst I was doing
those emails I came to the most daunting
but exciting realization that I'm
actually leaving for France on Monday I
mean it gets hard on my makeup and
double chat today I was thinking that we
could do a better bit get ready with me
yesterday I went to a co-payment and I
did a really bright bold lip this lip
just here and I just did a really fresh
glowy natural skin so I thought that I
would recreate that for you guys today
cuz I really liked it and I haven't
really done something super simple in
Wales all my eyelash extensions it's
pretty much falling out so that's why I
look like bit bald in the eye eyelash
department
my nails are off and they're looking
tragic but I'm having a bit of a pappa
day tomorrow because tomorrow is Friday
and that's my last day and my last
chance to sort of get everything
prepared before I go to front yeah party
moisturized with the Kinect most of
moisture surge extended thirst relief
gel cream we went to a clinic event
yesterday and we got a whole bunch of
products and this is amazing so because
I've got so many exciting products I
really just want to try try a bunch of
Clinique out so this is the clinic
uplifting liquid illuminizer we're going
for a really glowy look today sorry
remember that just said that it was full
I have a 64 gigabyte um thingy memory
card and I haven't had to delete
anything in like months it was the first
time it said card full which is exciting
it has so much room on it that is
amazing because glowy that makes my skin
look that's so pretty that would be so
pretty
is something that you could just win out
on an everyday basis like if you're not
wearing any makeup so I really want to
try out this rodeo skin tint with SPF 20
um I'm hoping it's the right shade for
me it's in the shade scent baths number
3
Wow looks like a pretty good shade okay
I love skin tense because that's
generally they're quite light on the
skin you don't feel them that much and
this one has SP
which is amazing yeah I really like that
that's really nice on the skin and it's
super lightweight it's exactly what I
wanted you now for concealer I want to
try out this airbrush boying concealer
by benefit I've tried this
industrial-strength one and it's nice
and I used it for a while but I realized
I put my finger in this one today that
sounds so Jenny yeah I'm just felt it
and I'm super super creamy so I think
I'm gonna like this one a lot more the
other one was just a little bit drying
oh my god oh good pepper all over my
face anyone else have a long-haired cat
and just it is the number one thing that
just ruins your life that's just fair
everywhere yes I'm gonna try out this
concealer this using the shade number
one and wonder if God yeah I think I've
got I've got number one and number three
but number three is too dark excuse me
I'm getting a thing cool no I'm okay I'm
just filming so I'm all good okay okay
cool I'll see you soon then I'm just
filming what so yeah this concealer
could almost be a little too creamy I
feel like it's not like staying in its
place it's nice and brightening though
it's definitely good for days that you
don't want to wear too much because you
can just put a little bit on oh yeah
that's better
this would be super perfect for everyday
I feel concealer that I've been using
every single day is this Sigma one I've
used it I use it just on my eyes or on
the darkness when I go to the gym and
things just when I'm looking extra tired
and it's like the perfect shot oh just
dug my finger in it it's a perfect shade
for my skin tone it's called the lose
the halo lip concealer but I don't use
it for lips at all I just use it for my
eyes just gonna put a bit on the
darkness and vain
on the top of my eyelids as well I've
got the vainest eyelids ha yes let's get
talking oh my goodness so basically I
was looking through my emails and Nicole
was just sending me sort of my itinerary
for my flights and I'm going in like
three days
so it's Thursday today this video will
be up on Sunday and I will be leaving as
you guys are watching this yeah if you
guys are watching this on Sunday I will
be leaving tomorrow not gonna lie it's a
little bit stressful I mean obviously
I'm so excited but it's gonna be one
hell of a trip to be honest I'm only
there for a few days I've got 30 hours
in transit on the way there and then
I've got 30 hours of transit on the way
back and I'm gonna float three days so
it's gonna be a lot of traveling I'm
gonna be very tired but now I'm gonna
take this Naz liquid Laguna so this is
basically the liquid version of the
Laguna bronzer from NARS and I'm just on
the outer perimeter of my face
I loved this stuff because it's super
super obviously it's liquid form but it
makes it so easy to blend when you've
got really liquidy bronzes like this and
I find this one's not too dark so it
doesn't look crazy on your skin just
adds a really nice natural bronzer does
type dry down a little bit those Cedars
need to work quickly
so yeah the clinic event was so cool
yesterday and we got a whole bunch of
products from them so I'm excited to use
them in videos that are upcoming guys
I'm sorry about this that's going on my
neck that's the Sun reflection if you
can say it's reflecting off my table
don't really know what to do about it
Pelin by yourself can be really
rewarding it makes me feel really proud
of myself obviously but it can also be
very daunting especially when you're
just not sure you're doing and you're
going to a country that's not doesn't
speak your language Nick yeah you can
come in
nice haircut Thanks
looks good you like it well I'll be not
there probably all the loan moves
outside no why are they ruining my life
they started doing this yard work
outside my window this morning at 7:00
a.m. was the 7:00 or 7:30 or something
which is fine but it was directly
outside of my window like they could
have done the other side of the house
first but no they decided to do my
window talk about it you have to do a
voiceover for the rest of this video now
I don't stop I've had a bit of a chat so
I'm sorry guys I'm gonna have to switch
to mobile i7 now but I'll try to at the
end hopefully this guy has finished it's
been going all day though I don't have
any hope so I started off with this
cream stick which is from nude sticks
it's just this really nice in neutral
pink tone which just looks super natural
on the cheeks and then again from nude
sticks I took this golden cream
highlighter and just highlighted the
high points of my face this is going to
be act as a base for the powder
highlight that we're going to use on top
and I think this is the most important
step for when you want to have an
extremely glowing complexion
Oh otherwise I like to put it on my
shoulders and on my collarbones as well
it just ties everything together and it
looks super yummy I look super that's
another way other than glowing sleek and
then I just took this translucent powder
from the Estee Lauder Victoria Beckham
range and just set my eyelids my under
my eyes and just a bit of my t-zone just
because you don't want to be Whaley in
those areas you just want to glow in
there going through right areas and then
if I shadow I took this beautiful
palette by Charlotte Tilbury and I took
these three shades here actually I only
took this orange one in the middle and
then the shimmery shade on my lid
I just wanted to warm my crease up a
little bit and then bring a little bit
of light to my eyelids and to my tear
ducts I love adding warm shades in my
crease when I'm going for that really
glowy look it's my skin tone and then I
took this beautiful fancy highlighter by
Rihanna I can't remember the shade again
but it'll be down in the description box
and it is so beautiful and so so bright
so it's been one of my favorites at the
moment and I kind of just put really
everywhere when I'm going for that
glowing complexion I just I'm not
specific with the placement I just put
it on all the high points of my face and
then for this sort of editorial look
that I was going for I didn't fill in my
eyebrows at all but I just brushed all
my hairs right upwards and just really
really filled them
with the gimme brow by benefit I just
wanted to go for that really bushy
undone eyebrow look which the gimme brow
works perfectly for and then I didn't
really want to add too much from scar
because I was all about the lip but I
just didn't want to add a little bit of
definition to my eyes so I took the
Estee Lauder mascara and just lightly
filled in my eyelashes sorry if you can
hear that clicking that's just Nick
typing in the background and yes then on
to this okay so I think the lawnmower
has stopped for a second so I can talk
again this is the lip color that I wore
yesterday and I got so many compliments
on it so I definitely wanted to include
this in today's video it's by zoeva and
it's called sensor and it's pure luck
ellipse so it's not exactly matte but
it's not like lip gloss II
this applicator makes it so easy to make
a straight line like you saw one go I
just got it
are you dying
in there back
hopefully it's not too loud for you guys
cuz I'm about to end this makeup look so
I'm just gonna keep going when I keep
rolling and hopefully it's not bothering
you guys but I've got a few settings
raised here that I've been loving using
I've got the glam glow glow setter which
is a very fine mist and it's a setting
spray but it makes you look super glowy
I feel like I look kind of glowy
enough but that is an extra step if you
guys want it today I'm just gonna use
the toothpaste hangover 3 and one
refreshing coconut for a second please
okay guys thank you so much for watching
I hope you guys have enjoyed watching
how I get this really glowy dewy fresh
skin
this is the look I've been loving while
my eyelash extensions have kind of
fallen out doing a really bold lip with
no lunch look I think it looks really
fresh it's very editorial I feel in very
summery hope that you guys have enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching give me like two minutes why
it's quite literally getting louder and
coarse up
and faster I will see you in my next
video which will probably be a vlog of
my trip inside repay with Clarence see I
haven't even been able to tell you guys
that I've never been able to have a
proper chat with you which I'm really
sad about but I'll explain everything in
my next video where I'm going why I'm
going who I'm going with

have enjoyed this video and I'll see you
