o for this video leave a head like a
bouncy oh my god so today's video is
going to be a get ready with me I've got
my best friend's twin first tonight
we're just going for dinner but I have
heaps of new products I want to try as
well so I thought it'd be a really good
chance to do not really a first
impression for you because I don't have
all the stuff so first impressions but I
have been sent quite a few beautiful
things that I thought I could try out on
camera the skin crap is the most
important part for me
so I've already cleansed my skin and now
I'm going to go in with my moisturizer
this is the maybe I'll move across the
soil with have some Sun at least what is
happening I don't know um I'm going to
go in with my Olay Olay hendrickson
moisturizer I'm so excited to show you
guys an updated skin care routine
because it is just another little
another level of amazing I think I'm
going to do a nighttime routine though
is that something you guys would like to
see I've been my morning routine
recently and I really enjoyed filming
that and so I meant to get that all this
entire routine but I haven't got around
to it yet I'll include my skincare
routine in that video get my night time
skincare routine heaven upon the sensual
skin primer best primer values it's
pretty much a sort of a super thick
moisturizer it just makes whatever
foundation I put on top like so I
thought I would tell you while I have
you guys I do weigh less makeup
tutorials these days I've ever really
enough videos to tell you guys that I've
been loving this it caused an excessive
cream and the illumination one is insane
it is amazing it is so full coverage so
beautiful it makes your skin looks just
airbrushed so if you guys looking for
good CC cream I've definitely gotten all
that weight like it's very full coverage
but it's got an SPF of 50 in it so it's
a good everyday things
if you're looking for one but today I
want to try out that's hot stick so they
don't know where I put it
and she's very enthused I swear if it
right in front of me guess I'll go in
with this one this one I've been loving
as well the other decay all nighter
foundation and this is really good I
went to dinner later sand stays on
like cement I sure have super sequels
for cover so you guys now I really like
full coverage that much so I just use
like a really small amount top better on
my face a little more Wow I feel like
I'm a little bit all over the place
right now I'm real sorry because I only
used to film tutorials I just got into
the swing of things and now I do like
what the worth of everything I do has my
brain is considered a blip it's super
matte as well I always go for doing
really light coverage foundations go
into the shop that I like this one but
um I love it it's amazing I only wear it
though when I'm going to an event or got
like it and night out or dinner
something I've gotta wear my makeup all
day that's your opinion on shaving your
face doing you guys do it I really want
to I wanted to get that facial done
where they actually just show you it for
you really believe me I'm gonna move you
across again I know in space when you
can get facials where they do it for you
but I also know that a lot of people
just buy those little things and just
shave them their faces themselves if I'm
going to it for a while I've got a
premium special kind of haven't got
around to it and / and not like a
hundred cents short I should do it and
then everyday basis I've been using this
Maybelline fit me concealer is so light
and then really nice coverage but
because right now I'm going to use my
shape comes to you tonight this is all
very boring you seem a lunch of tons
before so let's get to my next see their
support set my concealer anything on my
face I've got quite a few cream coats on
and try out this looks so intense than
very curious I don't know how well it'll
sit on a matte foundation but
that ago it's the cover FX custom
enhancer drops in moonlight which I
thought was so loved it looks gold so
I'm just going to put I'll go a little
bit there and then okay well I think I
recommend not going to show the face
because you can see we're a bit about
cakey maybe I'm like my hand first I've
been like a super intense and quite cool
with can you see that it's just not
blending oh no I hate that like a hater
keep going I'm assuming that would work
better on like a QE foundation because
this is quite a matte foundation I just
didn't blend this oh my god okay if I
could recommend any products in my whole
entire life it would be this one I think
this is the SI water Double Wear radiant
bronze cushion stick and I wear this
everyday even when I'm not working
makeup I love it that much that I put it
on basically I don't want any foundation
on my face and I put this bronzer just
like around my forehead and on my cheeks
and it just instantly makes my face look
a little bit more tanned and a little
bit more alive than what probably looks
without anything on it it's super
natural so it comes out like that comes
out like that and you just kind of dump
it on it's super super liquidy so it's
really easy to blends just take a brush
and I just blend that in it's super
duper subtle super easy to blend and
just gives you like that beautiful
healthy bronzy glow Joey knows learn any
other cream products I'm here as well
why not
is this clinic pop oil in Rose glow the
Korean products actually ended up
looking okay on top of this foundation I
feel like at first it was like well no
patchy metallics
nice and glowy again okay I'm just going
to be Quebec man dies with my Laura
Mercier translucent powder moving on
some cream products that took a while
let's try some powder products if
dummying a pallet from zoeva scald the
basic moment and it's got a contour a
highlighter and beautiful baby pink
blush you want to try out this bronzer
from mechanics first matter maxima had
come out with their own makeup brand
which is called meta max you guys
probably have seen it all over the place
how stunning is that packaging I love
the colors and so amazing and I'm going
to use their sunlit skin bronzer just to
runs up my face a little bit more
because I don't have enough bronzer on
already big brush I love that I love
that oh my god I love that
that is amazing those amazing amazing
amazing I love that so much that I'm
also gonna put that in my crease we must
take the blush from the top Oh super
cute baby pink blushes my all-time
favorite blush I always wanted uh my
nose as well now I got this Anastasio
glow kits in my Sephora showcase bag and
I have it I was watched it with my
fingers but I haven't actually tried it
yet so I said I would try that first on
camera and I have the Anastasio brush as
well which I really love this brush you
go into moonstone well okay
that's really pretty
pretty intense
this is content go over the top just
melt it in that's a little bit so I'm
just been looking on my palette and I
think because my highlight and blush is
looking quite pink toned which I never
do pink I'm going to do pink on the eyes
just so that it looks like I've done
that sort of on practice but um so I'm
going to go in with my Z palette and I'm
going to use a few just pink toned
shades and see what we come up with
creme brulee so I'm going to begin with
creme brulee as my transition shade all
the same brush just to make it easy I'm
going to pick up cupcake this is altered
by makeup geek and that's just pink
no-name okay that doesn't help
this shade has been a game on it but
it's by color pop and I'm going to use
that on my lid
that's really pretty now I'm going to
add top notch by color pop into the
outer way just to deepen it a little bit
awesome
I know why this one has maybe four dozen
so I'm actually going to add that in no
name shade that really pretty copper
color underneath my lash line all the
way under inner corner color we will
pick up this shade which is a baby pink
and it's called laiÃ¡ laiÃ¡ laiÃ¡ color
pop whoa yeah what we're going to
measure these ugly eyebrows this whole
time okay
I'm using my eyebrows now with my
benefit precisely my brow I think I can
take the tech lid off now and now I'm
going to use my giving brow by benefit
just to put my brows in place and we
find that this look is lips I really
want to have this melted latex liquid
with the shine thing from Too Faced but
I'm going to use over time sir when
you're going with my trusty hourglass
panoramic lip liner in Eden pie up this
melted latex now whoa I'm not that into
glasses though just because I feel like
they come off so much quicker than her
lipstick does and I quite like the matte
look but um it's quite nice I really
like that I was very lucky as well all
of these products were great first
impressions except for that cover FX
drops I think they would work for that
would work really well for people that
love intense highlights but yeah that
was just not for me
it is it maybe as the foundation I used
to just didn't sit really nicely on the
foundation and I think I've got to try
under the foundation because it's so
blinding I'm imagining that underneath
the foundation that I can on top and it
just I can imagine it would be quite
beautiful so immuno experiment with a
product and female X pockets and if I
like it I'll let you guys I hope you
guys have enjoyed this video let me know
what you guys on the team or get ready
with me I think that's the best moment
for me to go about doing tutorials
because I'm socially not like
may help secondly I don't have that many
looks to give you but thirdly I do have
heaps of new products constantly coming
in all the time and the best way for me
to try them out is with get rid of these
so let me know if that's what you guys
want to see I will see you in my video
