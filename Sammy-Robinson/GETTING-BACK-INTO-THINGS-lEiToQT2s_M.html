deliveries oh my god let's have a little
unboxing ordered to watch faces in a
band I've been eyeing off marble watches
for ages and so look how gorgeous as
this one is I don't know if you guys
know but I love love love love marble
things about marble phonecase marble
laptops and this leather band is so soft
so comfortable every other watch that I
own is quite hard just want to sit so
nicely a nice medium sized I still got a
nice big face but it's not too
overwhelming
sorry about the focusing issues that's
so annoying and then we've got this one
I love how it all has different
packaging it's so cool and this one is
so different I've never seen anything
like this and the mustard with black I
just think that is so different and
unique
it's got straight black face and then
like a mustard leather band I saw the
mustard and I was like that would look
incredible with black and it does I love
it and you guys if you guys know me you
know I love my big huge watchers so I
thought I wanted something a little bit
more simple and dainty because mustard
is pretty out there I also got myself
another little with a band so that I can
switch it to just plain black if I need
and so that's what the black band looks
like it's actually really surprisingly
easy to switch the bands over I'll leave
a link down in the description if you
guys want to go have a look so next up I
got some stuff from the body shop of
this it smells like heaven oh my god
like pure honey almond milk honey scrub
off milk shower cream teeming this is
like a body butter I love the body shop
body butters body lotion flat leg goals
and I got this gorgeous packet from it
TDE
it's the one that engraved little
leather pouches and they got me this at
all
I'm assuming it's a little toiletry bag
with sammy engraved i love it because it
has the gold engravings so pretty I got
this daily moisturizing cream for
Saturday skin this is heaven in a box oh
my God all these eyelashes from the
makeup cosmetics are a whole bunch of
clothes from C Foley so I've got some
gym pants gym tops and casual pants this
really pretty wraparound top and if you
guys know me you know I always wear my
own malaya sarong so so keen to have a
few more and then finally we got these
gorgeous gorgeous swimsuits from Malaya
this one is going to be my favorite that
is gorgeous what actually on earth
how far out thank you so much to all the
brands that sent me their things I am so
lucky and I just don't even know how I
would ever express my gratitude good
morning guys so this is a really weird
feeling I feel like I haven't picked up
the camera in a while and properly
blogged since la actually and that was
like over a week ago so I'm going to be
a little bit rusty
giveme took a few clips as well when I
got this camera like testing out
lighting and stuff so I don't know if
I'm going to be inserting that in this
vlog whoo hi guys I'm on my new camera
right now going out I don't know if I'm
going to be vlogging tonight because
they've got so many pre-recorded videos
to be doing from Coachella that I
haven't yet started having actually
really had the chance to sit down and
edit anything out so I've got lots of
videos coming and I don't really need to
start a new vlog because it's just going
to be so far behind but um I just wanted
to get this new camera out and test it
and I just cannot even sure if I like
that anyways we'll keep testing it out
and see how it goes okay so I'm out in
better lighting now and you can see a
little bit more clearly I think I think
my room light was just like super harsh
a bit strange but it's still so airbrush
my god yes this one I just have to add
in a bit more normal lighting I bought
these glasses when I was in LA that I
actually have lenses in them
how can you tell us that others had a
shower that was so much fun I just
wanted to test the camera with no Mequon
and looks like a fossil face foundation
these are my new new pajamas from
Victoria Secret I got them in LA yes I
do have a new camera and I don't know if
I like it I don't know I don't know I'm
going to be switching up between my
other vlogging camera in this one as I
was using my other vlogging cameras so
often it was just go it getting hot
turning red turning off it was just
obviously you guys saw in my blogs it
just wasn't working very well so I'm
going to be switching up between the two
just charging the other one leaving for
a bit and using this one so this morning
I broken up and done some Pilates it was
like one of my first sessions back and I
am so shaky it's weird you go one week
without exercise or it like a week and a
half without exercise and is just like
feels like a weird thing ever to get
back to today now so it's about 12 now
and I was just eating some lunch
it's a Saturday as well I'm definitely a
bit rusty
so yes it's 12 p.m. on a Saturday and
days and I going to go to the Glebe
markets I haven't been to the Glee
markets in so long and Davis has been
going heaps lately so that I would come
with her today my camera is probably
going to die oh no no it's got 67%
stunning I charged this camera like four
days ago it's still got 67% that is
awesome I'm going to vlog today and
bring you guys along with me don't know
what I'm doing this afternoon I haven't
really planned rest of my day but yeah I
got my hair done by yola's yesterday at
Cole's hair bar it's just like cars if
you search it COV I just got a trim I
really like the blunt cut I don't like
having my hair into a V so I just got
the bloody cut done and he just
freshened up my colour so we don't dye
my hair we just put like a toner through
it just so that doesn't go brassy you're
not really going to be able to see my
outfit but little stripey singlet and
some overalls by Calvin Klein oh my god
I can't see any
we're going yet some with days this is
my new camera do you like it oh I didn't
even notice it was different if you look
up closely it's waiting giggling yeah
way bigger this is the Verizon sleeve
you're going to have a wonder I get some
sales because lovely balloons
I might get some fresh fresh lemonade
and something maybe an acai bowl and
then it's today oh okay my tray table
and we'll have a wander I'm not planning
on buying anything but knowing me I'll
probably spend like $100 to show you
guys around the markets and beautiful
day to be a lot aful so if jay-z was a
cactus she would be this guy right here
should be the long lanky one on the
whole walk like
hey guys so it's now about 5:30 and I'm
about to go off to Nick's house I'm not
going to love tonight but um I just
thought I'd show you what I bought today
I've always had a breakfast hook yeah I
thought I'd to show you what I bought at
those markets I'm wearing it right now
it's a banty from Harley Davidson and
then I got these pants as well just kind
of like playing flurry pants oh they're
so comfy and I got them for $5 the best
thing ever and then I got this ring I
thought it matched really nicely with
that ring because Nick got me this one
with a diamond on and it just looks cute
with a blue thing similar size and then
I also got I also got myself some I was
called an incest but I don't think it
insensitive to users so of them one was
vanilla and sandalwood and one was
watermelon which was like different
flavors not watermelon anywhere and it's
really nice and strong and yes I wasn't
too big of a shot but I wasn't actually
planning on getting anything so still
pretty successful day for me and it was
really nice to see days today I haven't
probably properly had to catch up with
her since I've been back from LA so that
was really nice to see her and I haven't
seen mixed family in ages either so I'm
excited to go for dinner there tonight
and just hang out with everyone such a
nice little area to sit on a night like
this mm-hmm
got these beautiful flowers from Nick
for our one-year anniversary so stunning
how beautiful they've blossomed
got my handy man over here building a
chair for me how you going I brought
myself this office chair and I haven't
put it up yet so thank you darling
meanwhile I look like this I've just put
up my la vlog which I added very
differently I didn't put much music and
it was quite a Rollag so I'm just
reading through your comments now and
answering them well Nicholas makes my
chair and so far you're all being so
lovely about it because I didn't want to
seem like I was being lazy and not
editing on purpose I was trying to make
it seem very like harshly cut and like
each sound being very I don't know how
to explain it if you watch it you'll
understand what I mean like it's just
very unedited and um quite raw so yeah
I'm glad you guys are enjoying that
yeah mmm perfect good morning guys
so this chart over say to extent I got
the camera for late
a week ago haven't I said amazing I'm
just making myself a cup of tea I like
to make myself a cup of tea in the
morning when I wake up just to get
center that hot flash warm lemony waters
are really good for you in the morning
so I like to have sort of a peppermint
tea or green tea before I eat anything I
also have a protein ball because then
I'm going to be going to Pilates today
and then I have breakfast after that so
yeah just making a tea no and I'm going
to do some emails and editing and I'm
sum of two videos today I thought they
look swollen again as strange but it's
not busy like saw in last few days yeah
I like to take the time in the morning
when I wake up just to sort of you know
when you have to get straight up and
it's quite painful the high painful
process so I like to get up and do work
straight away but I don't push myself to
have a shower and get out of the house
immediately I like to just like have a
tea and do my emails that I probably
miss them that before I like to do a bit
of editing so it gets me motivated for
the day so I see what I've got done and
what I need to get done what videos are
coming and what else I need to film
gonna be filming a prom makeup look
because I've had cut a few if you asked
me to do so I think it must be prom
coming up in America I'm just going to
drink my tea do a little bit of work and
then I'll run off to Pilates and
probably check in with you guys later so
I had just
so I have just finished filming this
look it's sort of a prom formal I was
planning in the video it's like we call
it formal here in Australia but I think
you guys call it prom in the United
States I've had a lot of requests for
prom makeup look so I can only assume
that you guys are either having your
problem soon I have had it maybe I'm a
bit late I'm not sure but either way I
just filmed this look and I'm about to
film the outfit portion my sisters label
dress I'm so obsessed with this yes I'm
just probably just going to be spending
the rest of the day editing I'm really
on a roll with my editing I've got a
video going up tonight as well and I'm
in and I go get myself some sushi as a
reward after yeah it's nice just to
children occurring over I'm not seeing
the girls so I think I'm just gonna have
a really early one because I'm feeling
like I'm getting a little bit sick I'm
just going to start drinking like
thousands of cups of tea just loaded up
the dishwasher gave out here a bit of a
clean lounge room was super messy before
and I just unpacked and put all that
crap oh hey there's my new little office
space so next put my chair together for
me I've put a throw over it and this is
my what I'm working with that's what my
used to film but suspecting my little
area for me to get my editing done so
that I don't have to like sit on the
couch anymore mum has put these little
hangers in for me so that I can hang up
my designer handbags how that has a lot
of fun that comes through or my other
bags and I just didn't want there to be
sound on them and then I didn't want the
map to have to sit on this shelf with
everything else that's stuff they're all
my hats and stuff so that's Nick's shelf
I've got this whole closet and he's just
got one little shelf and this hanging
space mold
yes I thought that was a cute addition
putting I've just got my Gucci and my
YSL and on this side I've got my two at
Chloe bags so yeah I think that's really
cute addition to my shelf no I just am
in the middle of giving my
a bit of a cleans had put a makeup all
over it before I'm just kindly uploading
my prom makeup look so I'm going to get
that exported and uploaded and and then
I'm going to go get my nails done I
haven't had long nails in a long time
this is the before that looking healthy
healthy ish now I've given them a good
break from having the SNS that I really
am craving putting them back on so I
don't know how long I'll have them on
this time but um I just really want some
long nails again and then yeah I don't
know how long this blog is I think it's
pretty damn long I haven't really
started editing it yet so I think I'm
