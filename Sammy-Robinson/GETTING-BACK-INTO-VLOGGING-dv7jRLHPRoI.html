doing well for time good morning
everybody have you over there we were on
my old camera
oh let's see how this goes today so this
morning I'm going to Bondi first stop is
to the one day cutie because I'm meeting
the girls from Sephora and we're gonna
go have a big day together essentially
what this day is celebrating is they're
opening a new Sephora in bondage so I
get to have a really luxurious day
filled with yoga and lunches and then we
get to go to the straw opening tonight
which is at like 4:30 5:30 and have a
look at the new store and then we get to
stay at the cutie which is always funny
for me because I live in Sydney so when
they get girls from out of state it
makes sense to like keep them in hotels
it's always funny
made staying in hotels when I live here
but I'm not gonna say no and then this
book is probably gonna either depends on
how much footage I get this foot will
either baby just a daily vlog or maybe a
few days because today is Friday it is
currently
7:00 in the morning and we have to be
there by 8:15 which there is a lots of
peak hour traffic so I'm just praying
that I make it on time I think will be I
can't live like quite a lot of time yeah
come along with me I haven't logged in a
while like since Bali but that was just
kind of like it's amazes and
you
what is so we have arrived at Marks Park
and we are going to do some morning yoga
now it's super hot but it's a really
really nice day today
down at Bondi Beach right now finished
yoga and we're gonna go we are so hungry
so I've arrived in my hotel room and
this is what our hotel looks a so cool
I've got a little balcony at the front
this is the QT Bondi by the way and I've
got a little Prezi and a few gifts from
Sephora so the present was an aqua bucks
book by the photographer Eugene tan if
we just went and visited their store and
it was so beautiful
and then we've got a little package of
system Sephora goodies and makeup and
things like that a little bit of a
wellness package which is all my
favourite things we've got some glow
powder some skincare some hair care some
face masks which I will definitely be
doing tonight because I'm not going out
here in the bathroom I got some shampoo
and conditioner so now that I'm at the
Qt I've got about an hour to kill so I'm
just getting a little bit of work done
realised I've completely forgotten to
draw the winner from my last giveaway so
I thought I'd do it together with you
guys this is like a week a week late I
just completely forgot I didn't get a
notification in my mail this time well
maybe I did and I missed it but let's
say you won
whoo-hoo Oh so we got someone from
England the United Kingdom yippee
so congratulations to you I'm sorry if
I'm pronouncing your name wrong but you
have won my go away and I will be
emailing you now so make sure to check
your emails and congratulations okay so
I just got ready did my makeup with some
of my new Sephora products but we are
gonna go to I actually don't know where
we're going for drinks we're going for
free drinks and then at the opening of
the Bondi store so there is sort of an
influencer event opening champagne
drinks tonight and then there and then
the store is officially opening tomorrow
morning which will be Saturdays okay so
I will show you guys a little outfit
shot I don't think I'm gonna be able to
get that great of lighting because
that's facing away from the light I'm
just wearing a simple little dress and
some heels because it is so hot today
and my camera just started flashing dead
what my camera my other camera lasts so
much longer so you can probably see it
better in this mirror I'm just wearing
this little dress which I got off the
verge girl verge girl wearing just some
plain nude heels and just my Gucci bag
so to end off the day I'm going to do
some editing I ordered myself some over
eights so I got a chicken wrap a salad
some bone broth and a remedy kombucha
that's kind of shitty at vlogging today
I feel like I didn't capture that much
do you guys to see but I will vlog
tomorrow and probably maybe a bit on
Sunday and a little bit of Monday maybe
I've got Pilates in the morning and I
just have a few jobs to get don't like
errands like like take my car to the car
wash and just put a bunch of clothes
away and boring stuff so I don't know
how much I'll vlog but and I'm gonna go
to sleep I also ate a measly bar and a
packet of Polly's from the minibar so
I'm having a bit of a sugar rush but not
in a good way not even not in an
energetic ways you know daring crash and
die way yeah
but yes I hope that you guys have
enjoyed the footage from today and I
will see you tomorrow
cycle it up behind the buildings yep no
worries just cameras swear so this
weekend I haven't actually blogged at
all my camera died and then I just it's
almost dinner time we're having a glass
of red for dinner Sunday family dinner
and while we're waiting I'm just
prepping some bananas my family and I
love smoothie balls and banana smoothies
in the morning so we like to take the
bananas that are a little bit too bright
and put them in Ziploc bags that looks
kind of grace those and also I'm just
cooking up scuse me yeah and I got the
loo in this day one you lighting a few
candles yeah how romantic
this salad looks absolutely exquisite as
just this cat hello cat how are you what
are you doing today
oh you want to give the camera a hug
also I got my nails taken off and look
at the state of them that is not healthy
I'm gonna have to start taking some hair
and nail vitamins
looking good
I'm also prepping some fresh
strawberries as well to add to these
smoothies there we go so we have just
finished up at dinner and it has made me
a cup of tea and we are just gonna
finish off the night watching a little
bit of Netflix and then going to bed
kind of early so that we can have a good
week this week we didn't go out much
this week at all so that we could have a
really productive week we always find
when we drink on Sundays even though we
it had like a bosses read but when we go
out on Sundays or even on Saturday so
just I'm Way less productive in the week
so that's what we're gonna do
I will share them with you guys tomorrow
