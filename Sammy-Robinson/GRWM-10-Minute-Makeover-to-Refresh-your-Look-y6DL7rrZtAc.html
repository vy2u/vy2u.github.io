beautiful day today it's been really
really pretty recently breccia I made
myself some scrambled eggs on sourdough
with avocado so I've been going to the
gym recently and getting Ben to
obviously film my workout so I'm just
going to do a bit of editing on these
now like I don't do much data but just
like crop them and I'm gonna put them on
my Instagram so you guys can go to my
Instagram if you wanna check out workout
videos so we're going to see whether
that's good lighting I'm just sitting in
the same spot that I usually sit but
obviously my desk and stuff is here so
I've switched you guys to my big camera
now cuz I just want to do a bit of it
get ready with me I have a meeting in
about 45 minutes I just want to show you
guys what I do to whip myself into shape
I suppose when I don't have that much
time and when I don't want to wear too
much makeup and when I look like a grub
my skin is just bit dull just want to
brighten everything up and just make
myself feel a little bit more
presentable so I guess it's like my 10
minute makeover and tips and tricks to
pulling yourself together when you don't
have much time I've just cleansed my
skin and I'm just gonna moisturize and
stop on camera with you guys now you
guys know my pride and joy my voice to
search I've talked about it so many
times before but I fully have almost
finished this guy which was my new one
they've launched their new clinic
Moisture Surge 72 hour water
replenishing hydrator and I used to my
old favourite one was just the Moisture
Surge
just I think it was just called the
moisture sedge but they've recently come
out with this one which is just like the
level up with hydration basically
legitimately hydrates your skin for 72
hours like without having to reapply
even after washing your face I talked
about it the other day that I was
running out of my moisture so I was so
lucky and I know Tony sent me one
replacement but they sent me to I've got
two more
a collection and like this is the type
of thing that I feel like I genuinely
would be like I don't need this much oh
let me do giveaway and I'll include it
for you guys but like no not this stuff
this stuff is like water to me it's like
the nicest gel like consistency oh gosh
it's so funny every time I do my makeup
I get glued oh it's like the most
beautiful gel like consistency and it
just really hydrates your skin and makes
it feel so soft
I've already almost finished halfway
through this one as well
maxi jokes it's not making it easy to
sit down so let's do something with this
hair now thought I would just show you
guys all my little quick things that I
do with my hair depending on how sweaty
and gross it is like oh okay
this is just like I don't think I can
resurrect this it's just it's long gone
yeah so if I was to keep my hair out I
would use my Bumble and Bumble baby dry
shampoo just spritz it all through my
hair and just refresh it gives it a
little bit of volume and like the curls
stay so it's like really nice but my
hair is past the point of fixing so I
mentioned you guys how I slick it so I
basically just run like a brush through
it it's like so simple to me sometimes I
use like the days that you see that my
hair is extremely slick I'll run like
oil all through it I just spin it around
and then I just wrap the rest of it
around
but so that's literally as simple as it
is like all I do it's so easy and
depending on what liquid I have around
me so you know maybe I might have like
my max prep and prepping set prep and
prime I might just like spritz it in my
hair just to get rid of all the whiskey
bits and that's like as easy as it is
sometimes I use hair spray but right now
I don't I'm completely out of hair spray
so yeah that's basically as simple as
that can be alright now let's get on to
the makeup so I prepped my skin I'm just
gonna use a bit of my clinic Moisture
Surge
face spray as well it just feels so
refreshing and it's been so hot recently
and then I've actually been really into
using this glam glow plump rageous gloss
lip plumping treatment and this is like
fire on your lips like it really burns
but it really plumps them up so just
before I do my makeup it's just so quick
and easy and it just adds like a little
bit of lip color to your lips so I'm
going to start off with my Bobbi Brown
Skin Foundation SPF SPF 15 foundation
I've got two shades like this I always
get one quite dark and one quite light
and just mix them together depending on
my skin tone because right now I don't
have any fake tan on and I'm not that
tanned anymore into slowly approaching
us and I'm not not feeling that tanned
I'll use most of the light one and then
just add like a teeny bit of this darker
one it's super lightweight which you
guys know that I love lightweight
foundations that don't feel like
foundation it feels like skin but it
just kind of evens out your skin tone
like that's amazing for me um and I like
just using a really fluffy buffing brush
just to thin this one use my Bobbi Brown
as well it's the face boy in the brush
and on the days like today where I'm
just gonna be running errands and
basically just like cleaning my house
and I've just got one meeting I don't
like to have full coverage makeup on so
these are like the lightest things that
I own
and then I'm gonna use my Born This Way
concealer which is the one I've been
using and I like to blend it in actually
with my finger actually melts it in
although now that I've got these nails
it's making a little harder my nation is
just so nice and light
like this Too Faced concealer with the
Bobbi Brown foundation and then you guys
made my pride and joy my clinic chubby
stick in curvy contour I have any one
it's not that new but like new when it
finally got through the whole will watch
it I finished the other one like eight
years ago I just can't go past this I
just can't go past this one's a stick
it's better than everything and it just
blends out so much easier than any other
contour stick that I own and it's just
the perfect shade for me I find so
easter was on the weekend and I don't
think I've ever eaten so much chocolate
in my entire life you guys know I'm good
at eating chocolate and I eat it like
all the time anyway but my gosh if you
follow me on my social so you would have
seen how much chocolate we got it was in
saying chocolate for breakfast lunch and
dinner I think oh by the way as well an
update on the Clinique blemish control
skin care it has completely fixed my
skin I'm not on my blaring camera so you
guys will be able to fully see my skin
what it looks like right now it has
completely I've still got a few like a
little bit of scarring and like a little
bit of pimples on this cheek yeah it's
completely you fixed my skin so I
definitely recommend that if you guys
are getting blemishes the clinic blemish
blemish control it's good stuff now I'm
gonna be using a my Clinique chubby
stick in AB top apple also my favorite
I've been using it for literally years
it's the most natural-looking one and it
blends a
just like a dream on those days that I
just have to run out of the house and
have a meeting and I just want to like
pull myself together just having a bit
of blush just makes you look super
healthy and these days I haven't been
sucking out well and so it's not fun
this is the max do you fix in NC 25 just
a little bit cuz I haven't got that much
product on my face it doesn't increase
it just got took a little bit oily in my
t-zone because that's generally where
I'll get oily and we have highly any
concealer on so that doesn't really
crease either it's like to brush my
eyebrows up with a spoolie whenever I
have my brows like recently done and
tinted and shaped I don't really feel
like I have to put too much product in
them any product at all actually
I feel like putting product in my brows
makes me look quite like manly so now
I'm just gonna add a little bit of
powder bronzer this is my Too Faced
bronzer in chocolate Soleil I always
like to add a powder over the creams
just to kind of set it down as opposed
to adding like a face powder this will
kind of just act as both so quick and
easy as well and I also just add that
into my crease I've recently found a
newfound love for soft and gentle by Mac
again I got um I got sent it recently
again and oh my god it's so beautiful I
earned it eight years ago and then I
lost it feeling one of my sisters stole
it but it's just so pretty the inner
tear ducts to really wake yourself up
Raburn to lift your brow bone its
enliven up my body a little bit I always
feel like my skin can look quite dull
and then my face always looks so like
glowy and healthy because I've pretended
so many moisturizers and creams
everything like it looks healthy and
adult so I'm gonna add my origins ginger
souffle whipped body cream stuff smells
really good
just like it doesn't add a glow to my
body but it just like makes
skin feel much more hydrated my legs as
well my chest and then because once I've
added the body cream on and it's nice
and glistening already I then add my
highlighter to my decolletage you guys
know this is my heaven tip you've heard
for me million times but adding the body
cream first we'll just make it stand out
a lot more and really stick to the skin
I just think it's really important to
put on your shoulders in your chest
because otherwise it looks like you've
got a really shiny face and a really
matte body it just looks kind of weird
and sometimes if I have my legs on shell
I'll even put it on like my legs okay so
I'm already off to my shower obviously
put deodorant on and then I just like to
add a lot of perfume anybody that smells
good looks pretty to me recently when
I've been sleeping my hair i've been
loving to wear lip glosses cuz you know
when you wear your hair out you just
don't want to wear a lip gloss i've been
loving this one by Clinique which is the
clinic pop splash lip gloss in rose
water pop it just adds such a pretty
pink sheen and I still have the plumper
on underneath as well so my lips are
still sizzling okay yeah I'm gonna spray
the Moisture Surge face spray again then
my last tip as well just to make
yourself feel a little bit more dressed
up and glamorous is to add some jewelry
I've been loving jewelry recently I
haven't been very much makeup recently
at all been keeping my skin a bright
copiously because I was breaking out and
I just haven't really felt like going
out this weekend I had a really chill
weekend with my family a lot of my
girlfriends were away so I basically
just spent time with mom and dad and had
a pretty chill time like I went on the
boat with mom and dad
we heard Easter with the family I went
and saw the Swans play
I had a friend's 21st on the Monday or
22nd I think it was his 22nd that I've
been also loving this double stacked
hoops look so I've got both of these are
from lavage I don't know whether you
know these ones usually have daggers on
them but I took the daggers often in
these
it's just like a thinner ganglia who
love the double dangly hoops it's cool
that took me probably 20 minutes cuz
obviously I was talking to you guys and
explaining what I was doing but usually
it would take me like probably under 10
minutes I'm gonna run off to my meeting
now and I obviously won't bring you guys
in but I will see you afterwards I'm
gonna head to the grocery store after so
I'll just bring you guys along along to
the grocery store because I know how
much you would love to see that hello
sorry I'm back from my meeting I just
wanted to come and import my footage cuz
last time I imported my footage my thumb
my hard drive was corrupt so I just
wanted to make sure that what I filmed
earlier this morning was like yeah it is
so I'm just doing a little bit of
editing now and I completely forgot to
tell you I was supposed to tell you when
we were doing a get ready with me about
my whole campaign with um the Moisture
Surge we shot it recently any of you
guys seem to have follow me on snapchat
I talked a little bit about how I did a
shoot with no eyelash extensions no
nails and nothing it was really like
very natural and I just had the best
time it's just one of those shoots where
I just felt so so so lucky to be doing
what I do because because this clinic
Moisture Surge moisturizer is genuinely
my favorite moisturizer and I genuinely
use every day and so when they contacted
me and asked whether I wanted to be sort
of like the face of this new campaign
for the 72-hour Moisture Surge
range I was like yeah I think he's one
of those friends that I find I just
resonate so strongly with because it's
all allergy tested it's fragrance free
it's genuinely good for your skin it's
such a beautiful brand that puts so much
effort into making sure that their
customers are happy and that they don't
ever react and they put so much research
into each product that they make and
like not only the skincare for me
because obviously you know the Moisture
Surge and even this blemish control
thing that's completely fixed my skin
but the makeup for me as well just like
their beautiful Clinic foundation that I
love my chubby sticks and I just love
their lips lip glosses and my cheek pop
and just everything that's natural and
glowy about makeup
I love about makeup clinic does so well
and they're probably my favorite brand
just in general
so I'm so grateful for this experience
and if any of you in Australia go into
any mecha stores I'm sure you'll be able
to see make a Maxima stores and I think
it's only in certain Mecca Maxima stores
but my whole campaign will be there
you might insert some images for you
guys here as well that's one of my
favorite campaigns that I've ever shot
and one of my favorite campaigns that
I've ever been involved in and I just
love cleaning so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
