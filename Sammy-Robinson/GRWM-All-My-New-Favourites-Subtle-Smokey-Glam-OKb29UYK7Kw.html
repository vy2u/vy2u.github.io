channel so I've been listening to your
requests and I am doing a makeup look
that is out of my comfort zone I just go
ahead it out so weird it's absolutely
freezing in Sydney today so I think the
hoodie is necessary I'm gonna start off
with this profile - instant retouch
primer with faint from fenty Beauty I
got sent this the other day and I've
used it like three times and I loved it
like the foundation as well you know
what I've done again don't have a mirror
yeah I love this primer with the
foundation although the foundation is a
little too light for me so I've been
mixing this foundation which is the pro
filter soft matte foundation with my
clinic beyond perfecting super concealer
I've just put like a drop of this in and
it just like deepens it up a little bit
Wow so I haven't started coming a little
late in the afternoon because I was busy
this morning if the lighting isn't
incredible yeah it might get a little
dark but that's right I'm gonna speed
through so I'm just using my Beauty
Blender this foundation is not like the
ones I usually recommend you guys know I
usually recommend the really lightweight
ones this one's like extremely Matt sir
it's definitely different to what I'm
used to but it makes my skin just look
flawless and I've been breaking out all
over my face as you guys know recently
I've been combating that with like the
best skincare routine that I've found so
if you guys want a skincare routine let
me know as well I feel like I've just
nailed my skincare routine if I ever
feel as well like a foundation is like
super matte and that's gonna be hard to
bunny and I'd like to put the foundation
on I spray my face with the Photowall
sorry major Hayes with the touch of
spray and I feel like that just kind of
helps me blend it in and actually what
inspired me to do this makeup tutorial
was that I want to show you guys all men
favorite products right now but instead
of doing like my everyday makeup routine
with my favorite products because I know
you guys will be like stop cuz it's
gonna be the same as I always do I
thought I would just experiment with
makeup so I'll use all my favorite stuff
like a dark smoky eye or something just
a bit different I see something light as
well I think how does one change the
lighting I don't know so I'm using my
top shape tape which is no surprise it
really is the best though like for a
glam purpose like I would never wear
this on my everyday basis because the
foundations that I wear aren't full
coverage enough for it so that like when
the foundations are kind of sheer and
then when I put the top over the top it
looks weird like full coverage under my
eyes and then like not everywhere else
so and they really use it when I'm using
like my full coverage foundations but
I'm now gonna use my NAS cream blush in
orgasm um since I came back from Vegas
this is my favorite cream blush so it's
like super baby pink and like when you
blend it out it just looks so pretty
that Fenty foundation it kind of gets
rid of like a lot of the luminosity in
my skin it Maps me out where is this
makes you look a little bit more flushed
and healthy but like this light how do i
lighten brighten lighten and brighten
their camera no idea sometimes they use
cream highlighters and you know I always
use my curvy contour clinic Brown stuff
but like runs up but I'm not gonna do
that today because I'm sick of boring
you guys so I kind of just take the
powder and like push the powder into my
skin all around my t-zone and then I
just like take one of those on my brush
and just kind of set the rest of my face
now for bronzes this is my favorite
combination right now so I use this Marc
Jacobs Omega tantastic bronzer it's is
this giant bronzer on this big fluffy
brush and I just kind of I use this like
as a bit of a contour but also like just
my
so then I was using this as a bronzer
for so long it's actually incredible as
a blush this color pop it actually
doesn't have a name it's so filthy but
this as a blush and in my crease oh
looks blush like but it just complements
the Bruns are really nicely and then
sitting on top of the orgasm blush it
just adds like a little bit of pink and
it's just so pretty oh my lord
I couldn't have found a more perfect
crease color like I've used so many
colors and like I just don't like the
one just don't like the way that I shall
looks on me but I love the way that this
color looks at my crease and then it
ties the face in with the eye is really
nice holy nicely next up my favorite
highlighter which I haven't talked about
with you guys is this one my god it's
the Kristen LeeAnn Beauty Bane highlight
palette with urban decay and it's just
my perfect tones in a highlighter so
it's got like the really light one if
you like the light one it's got the
bronzy one and then the in-between one I
just kind of mix them all together look
how pretty that is once I finished off
the face I'll generally spritz this all
over my face I only just recently been
sent there so I've never really been
able to try it but the touch luminous
dewy skin mist is my favorite right now
the eyeshadows that I've been super into
it I've been wearing every single day is
my makeup geek Z palette I've been using
these non-stop and I just don't know why
I am stopped like they are just the best
colors the best formulas so fun you have
heaps there I love them and I'm gonna
create an eye look with it today so I'm
gonna start off with this guy here which
I believe is frappe still got it
frappe I'm gonna run this all through my
crease just to deepen that up so I'm
gonna do that like smokey look that I
did in my crystal night video recently
you guys asked for that and a lot of you
guys have been asking for me to just
step out of my comfort zone so that's
what I'm gonna be doing okay now I am
going to this poke a bear which is a
darker deeper red and put it in the same
spot but just kind of not blend it out
as much and I'm not doing like more on
the outer corner I'm really like
rounding it out as you can see and then
I'm gonna grab this dock one as well
which is mocha is it mocha yes and do
the same thing I'm just digging it out
but I'm just leaving the lid free nice
random Anastasio brush as well oh I've
got so many brushes in my collection and
I always just use the random ones I
really want to I don't know whether I've
said this already but I really want to
film my skincare routine for you guys
but the only thing is I've been wanting
to do that for a while
skincare routine for blemished skin
because I've had really quite blemished
forehead and like a quite a blemished
cheek recently and I'm just got like
really congested skin and I really want
to film a skincare routine for you guys
my thing is I use literally all clinic
and I don't know whether you guys like
it's basically literally all clinic and
it's the best like I want to show you
guys because it is the best
like it really combats my pimples I work
with clinic so I know that you guys like
is it sponsored but like genuinely I use
that stuff like I am obsessed like
stupidly obsessed with clinic so just
because it's like it's so good that it's
it would be stupid for me not to tell
you if you guys are having problem with
your like problems with your skin I just
I have a really good routine that I want
to share with you guys so now I'm using
my tongue Ford eye Kohl in metallic mink
and it's like a brown and this is gonna
be weird so okay this eye
totally changes your eye shape how weird
is that I never do this and the fall God
and the funny part is I not only never
do this but I never wear even mascara on
my bottom lashes so it always looks very
different
okay now this is where I then go in with
the same color so I'm gonna start off
with a frappe which was this color here
and then I'm just gonna grab like the
poker bash shade and just run a bit of
that under there as well really deepen
it up chickadee this orange shade and
I'm kind of is gonna run that in the
crease a little bit just to like a woman
up and so then that way I can just like
run it down here to and really smudge it
out can you see what I mean that's the
eyes done so I'm now gonna just do my
eyebrows with my benefit lets's cold
give proof I usually use the precisely
my brow but this is what was on my desk
and I just I get my brows shapes now
like I used to not really get my brows
shapes but I do now so I have to fill
them and all that much
nothing like not tattooed but just like
waxed
now my favorite lip combination which I
think that you guys are gonna love
because you always ask me what is on my
lips I start off with my bad mineral
attitude Jen nude lip liner which is
great it's bülent and I ever draw the
actual oh yes I always suggest if
you guys want overdraw your lips going
directly under the line of your lip
because you can't tell because generally
all it will fold over it so it's hard to
tell and it makes your lips look so much
bigger I go outside the line as well
this is so blunt it hurts so much and
then I kind of just messily feeling
oilless Wow and then what I do is I take
my hoodie beating it liquid matte
lipstick in the shade between II babe
which I would never wear a nude like
yes but I like Drori dog see how light
that is I take a brush like a little
brush and I guess sometimes I think I
really take the over drawing of the lips
like way too far but I just I'm so
obsessed with it produce that color so
you go from taking like a really dark
brown over drawing and like filling your
whole lips in and then you take like a
really light nude and you just mix it
with a brush you can do with your
fingers yeah the reason I like to do it
the brushes I don't like to have the
line really dark so I'll literally mix
it straight in with the line and that's
that so that is literally my favorite
products right now I hope that you guys
enjoyed it I know that you wanted to see
how I did this makeup the other day so I
thought I would recreate it for you guys
the clothes that I designed with
princess Polly and my whole is gonna be
the next video off of my channel unless
I film another video in the meantime but
that'll be my next video so stay tuned
I'm gonna be explaining all my pieces I
can't wait to show you guys like I just
cannot wait to show you guys but yeah
make sure you subscribe to my channel if
you haven't already and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
