so I got sent these new pallets in the
mail today yeah they're from zoeva one
is called opulence and one is called
cafe and I loved this opulence one so I
wanted to play with makeup today
it's got just like really cool unique
colors I thought and every part of me
would want to go for the bronzy colors
but I think I'm actually gonna go for
like the purples and the blues but we'll
see how it turns out I will use a few
colors from this one as well because
this is beautiful too it's just such an
interesting palette it's very different
and um yeah I really like that I'm so
inspired me to play with the makeup
today and also I love when I get sent
new brush sets that instantly just makes
me to put makeup on my face um so these
ones are from so your as well and it's
the opulence range it's got these really
cool burgundy so dark purple handles so
even as brushes it kind of like the idea
brushes that you used to be honest oh
yes today I just wanted to play with
makeup I've got a whole bunch of new
makeup that I've tried maybe once or
twice but haven't really used on camera
you guys I like using new products so I
can show you guys different things that
are out of the market right now so
and because brands are so kind and they
send me and need stuff all the time I
want to make sure that I'm using one
camera for them I'm gonna jump straight
in I'm gonna use this morning aura
illuminating cream from Estee Lauder and
this is the Victoria Beckham collection
packaging that's a nice illuminating one
so I have a lot to chat with you guys
about actually so much that is going on
in my life right now and to be honest I
don't even read my wave again yeah I'm
gonna be using a few methods in this
sound tutorial since I've been using but
this is the Mac Studio Fix fluid in NCS
30 and because I want it to be a little
bit more light coverage
juhi I guess I'm gonna add a bit of the
Giorgio Armani maestro glow into the mix
just to thin it out a little bit you
know so okay so I'm just gonna go ahead
and say the thing that I suppose doesn't
really matter if it doesn't happen but I
applied for a house actually like what
my thoughts about it is that I am so
incredibly lucky to live in a flat on
top of my parents because it's really
the best of the best you get to have
your own space and you're in privacy and
you get a kitchen and bathroom
everything like that
but I mean you don't have full
independence like I do still feel like I
am at home so I'm ready to just try
moving out going somewhere new and just
seeing how it goes for me you know like
I might I'm you know for a year and if I
hate it I can try somewhere new which
has something different or I'm you know
homes always here I've got such a good
relationship with my family that I would
be happy to move home as well which I'm
very lucky you for I'm very lucky that
I've got the opportunity to live at home
as long as I want
oh but I do think I want to try it try
it me that so yes that is what is
happening
I'll show you guys too much into the
flat like I mean I show you every now
and again me having to clean up every
single week because I get sent so many
things which I'm not complaining about
it is so lucky it's so amazing but um I
don't have enough space I don't have
enough storage so I'm gonna get a place
with an office so I can have all my
makeup and all my beauty and everything
in the office and that way my work life
is separated from my living because
right now I film in my bedroom or my
makeup is in my bedroom everything I get
centers in here you know etc etc I want
to be a sports girl I mean the other day
as well and we got heaps of sports girl
products and I've been using this every
single day without fail it's called the
Coco bronze liquid face and body bronzer
and I just put like a bunch on the back
and and just use my finger and I just
sort of cut that into where I would put
my bronze up see how it's like not too
much darker in my foundation but kind of
just warms up the outer parts of my face
which way you'll know that I love doing
and then I just take the same brush just
so yes it's a combination of things I
want to experience living out of home
seeing what it's like I want I need to
have more space I need somewhere that I
can have a switch off button where I go
workers there and now that you don't
tell me to relax or I get to just sleep
not in my office so it all just makes
sense to me and I'm really excited okay
and now for concealer I have been using
the Kat Von D locket concealer in m25
warm and this concealer I don't know if
I love it I just I've ran out of my top
shape tape well I saw a little bit but I
just save it for when I go out and
usually get myself some more of that
stuff and so the reason that I say don't
have too much hype about getting this
place is because I stupidly I went on
the weekend and I was so excited by this
place that I went home I applied or so I
thought I applied and just like
obviously waited because in this
Saturday so I waited Monday and I sent
the girl an email on Monday afternoon
and I said just checking that you got my
application I would love to bring my
boyfriend through some time to have a
look this week if that's okay like
obviously not being like because it's
mine but lucky if she can open it up I
would love for Nick to have seen it cos
he's gonna move in as well she replied
being like we don't have your
application so I said to the wrong email
address which was gold right so then I
sent in the proper application I got
email being like okay thank you will
send this across to the vendor along
with the other applications that they
received that morning in that weekend so
so I think I mean I would love to have
hope that I have it but I think there
was quite a few people that wanted this
place so fingers crossed but I'm okay I
do believe everything happens for a
reason so I'm not going to be too fast
if I don't get it it just means that
something better will come along um so
I've been setting my face with the Mac
Studio Fix powder these I know that
everyone and their frickin grandmas have
and I've never had never owned before
and I get why they are so popular I
totally understand so I take NC 25 to
set underneath my eyes my eyelids if I
die I did jump into it pretty quick like
I only like I've been wanting to meet up
at Aegis but I only went and looked for
the first time this weekend that just
passed that's what I do you love having
a YouTube channel for because it means I
get to just like document everything
it's really fun now the I think I got it
sent it with mecca's birthday collection
but I'm not too sure Mecca Maxima has
obviously their birthday coming up or
his chest pain and there was a big
birthday collection and this is a cool
Smashbox palette sculpting cheek palette
so I'm gonna bronze and I'm in a contour
I'm gonna bronze with this one yes I do
feel like I can tell you guys update you
guys along the way as I'm going because
if I don't get it like it doesn't matter
I can just say it's not the end of the
world but I do get it how much fun will
that be the only reason I haven't done
it yet which I was thinking about so
long and talking about this so long is
cuz I just it's a lonely job YouTube on
an everyday basis like I you know sit by
myself in my room and I'm filming and
then you know you sit by yourself and
you're editing and everything else that
you plan to go on you kind of by
yourself you really have like colleagues
around you and you don't have that sort
of normal us office feel I'll let you
know if you work in a pub you don't have
your friends around you and people
around you it's very lonely so
I was worried that if I moved out I
would become even more isolated side
note that runs repeating I'm using Mac's
warm solo blush and you know I do think
that I will be social because I'll have
a lot of friends around me and I don't
say where it is but I think where where
I'll be going will be more of a social
sort of social vibe anyways but um yes
oh that is good that is good yes I'm
going to try really filthy fingerprinted
hourglass ambient absolute strobe light
so they have their dim lighting their
strobe lights that aren't too intense
phone pretty sure they'll come out with
these and these are super super blinding
apparently so I'm going to take this guy
it's not too too too blinding but it's
definitely not subtle I think that's the
color let's try this guy oh yeah there
you go whoa that is the face song I'm
gonna just quickly do my brows because I
always really enjoy myself when I'm
editing and I see how jacked up my brows
out of the whole video so I'm just gonna
use my benefit precisely my brow pencil
my brows are insane right now honestly I
need to get them done really badly
but I'm waiting to do all my footage
beauty treatments this Friday because I
am actually going to New York this
Sunday which is gonna be crazy I sort of
feel like I just came back from France
so it's weird to be jetting off again to
the other side of the world but uh
specially New York you know LA it's a
little bit easier because you have the
one flat and then you're there but New
York you've got the flight to LA and
then you get the fly itself our flight
to New York and that's all definitely a
lot harder but obviously will be very
very worth it
I'll be vlogging the whole thing
so don't you worry and if you guys don't
follow me on my social smites Aram you
must do you seems like a must I'm using
my gimme brow because I post Instagram
stories and Instagram but I'm going to
take this zoeva Cafe palette and this
one has just like a good transition that
I'm gonna take that I've never been to
New York so it's gonna be to say why so
I'm just gonna wait till everything out
to say why I'm going take cup of the day
this brown guy just here on a smaller
blending brush and just put that on just
to deepen the crease up my sister has
also been helping me out and being my
little assistant which has been really
great it's taking a massive burden off
my shoulders it's just sort of helping
me organize giveaways helping me
organize just like things that need to
be put away put it away and real there's
my drawers and everything which she has
done an amazing job at so if you guys
want to see like a makeup collection
video
I can try from that before hopefully
I'll be moved out and then I can do sort
of like a organizational video maybe
instead well like at my office my office
space video moving on to opulence in
this palette this is the one that
inspired me to do this look oh I just
dug out the whole blue great crap I
don't know what to do guys color combos
I'm gonna do these through here those 3
bad this blue shade and put it all over
my eyelid that's real nice looks real
real nice I also really want to start
doing a lot more health and fitness
stuff for you because I know that you
guys really like that but I always feel
so intimidated
I mean like the German in the Pilates
studio so I think I might like when I
move out have like a biggest space to do
dirty like at home workouts and like
what I eat in a day and things like that
how beautiful is that below my gosh I'm
just gonna be continuing to pick up if
I'm blending I'm gonna be blending with
this shade here from the first palette
just so you know
I'm gonna take this one and I'm gonna
run that on my whole lower lash line I'm
gonna pack this lighter purple on the in
a sort of inner part halfway over if you
like I need to bring this color down
onto my lower lash line the gold didn't
really work for me
okay and then I'm gonna pick up this guy
crazy though what are you know I mean
it's not perfectly blended but you guys
know that I'm not that first I'd kind of
just don't care look at me so care to
make it look good for you guys but like
even when I go out like I just don't it
just like blending I'm just not faced
you know I'm happy how it is so I'm just
going but moving on to lips let's move
you guys back out so you can't see how
awful my blending okay so for lips I
thought that I would do a little lip
combo that I did the other day and I got
heaps of questions about strip down from
Mac
okay so I fully thought that I was
filming fully photos filming I was in I
don't know when it stopped filming but I
think it might have just been the
lipstick so I'm just going in with
sports girls with vertigo but um yeah
that completes the makeup look I'm not
gonna ramble on for too long because I
know how much I rambled at the beginning
of the video but I hope that you guys
have enjoyed it I love all of the
products that I use they all were really
amazing and yeah and I'll see you next
romantics video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
