too much
let's go name
hi guys so I was halfway through getting
ready we'll not halfway through only
done my foundation concealer but I
thought I would stop and get my camera
and film it so today I'm just gonna do
it get ready with me I feel like doing
something really dramatic something
really like gold and Fonzie and dramatic
and I'm curling my hair and just being
really glamorous so um yeah so I thought
I'd get my camera and film it for you
guys so all I've done so far is my
foundation and concealer and then I've
set my concealer with my AC on tour now
shake I'm going to cream contour my face
using my cover FX contour kit in medium
and I'm going to take the darkest shade
of the pallet and just warm up the outer
corner of my face
to set my face I'm using my Bobbi Brown
share finish pressed powder in soft
honey to bronze my skin I'm going to use
my Laura Mercier matte radiance baked
powder in bronze 0-3 just a really nice
warm baked front up runs has a really
nice Sheen to it because I don't think
it's completely than that but it's not
shimmery just but like that really nice
this look is going to be super super
bronzy so I'm going to be layering the
bronzy products you know I like my
bronzy looks so as a blush today I'm
going to use my Napoleon bronze Patrol
this bronzer gives you the nicest glow
and I just want like a subtle glow over
my cheeks I don't anything too pink to
highlight today I'm using my Burberry
highlighter it's in the shade nude gold
number two it's stunning
it's my new fave highlighter at the
moment I mean I change up my highlights
like every week but this one just is
quite subtle it makes you glow but it is
quite subtle it's got no gone to run
it's just got that beautiful Sheen as
well so I'm just adding that to all the
high points of my face you see that
I think that back it is an intense
the tents hot but it's not like
overpowering color or anything it just
yeah it's just it's just really nice
what about explain things I'm going to
try
so I'm just adding it to all the normal
spots and now let's get on to the eyes
let's fill in my eyebrows basically I'm
going to be using the brow power super
skinny brow pencil by it cosmetics it's
in the shade universal top top so I'm
just going to lightly fill in my brows
using this pencil
so I'm going to take a little bit of my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac and set my
eyelids now gonna bring it all the way
up to my brow bone I'm just going to put
on my eyelids instead of in my crease so
I'm going to set my eyelids with the
banana shade from the a central kit
and I think I'm going to use my
toothpaste semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette on the side of your shades but
I'm going to start off with peanut
butter and I'm going to run that it's
shade here and I'm gonna run that just
all through my crease
- way
so I'm just told my gosh if you can pick
snoring in the background that is
peacock gifty
picking up a more precise brush I'm then
going to go into truffled which is this
dark chocolate shade at the top clear
I'm just going to start deepening off
the outer corner
you start to slowly work that into the
crease
and sort of between each step I'm just
picking up my blending brush and do
stuff using what is done
so picking up the same truffle shade I'm
going to take a more defined sort of
pencil brush and I'm going to start
packing that on the inner corners make
sure you don't put on your tear duct so
you want to keep that nice and bright
to
I'm going to take peanut butter on my
blending brush and I'm going to blend it
all together so picking up a little
short shader brush I'm going to go into
butter paper and I'm going to pack that
on the center of my eyelid
take them about a peek at I'm also
putting that on my inner two ducts to
make sure that stays nice and bright
hang up the same pencil brush that we
use with truffled to begin with I'm
going to pick up a little bit more of it
and connecting the outer corner
and I'm also going to put that on the
inner corner as well
so now to make the bottom lash line in
the middle pot a little bit more I'm
going to go in with my Bobbi Brown
long-wear cream shadow stick in vanilla
and I'm going to put that in the center
of my lower lash line and now I'm going
to pack butter pecan on the lower lash
line
whoo now I'm going to take my Bobbi
Brown eye opening mascara in black and
I'm going to coat my top and bottom
lashes
I'm now just going to take my ardell
demi wispies dashes and I'm going to
apply them off-camera so I will be right
back alone otherwise otherwise this
video is going to be like 10 minutes
long so for my lips I'm going to take
the clinic lipliner in zero 7 intense
blush
and then for lipstick I'm taking my
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick in nude
okay so I'm back I got changed just cuz
I just felt water'll if I have a tough
lion but so I've just blow-dried my hair
so today I'm going to be using my new me
set of hair colors this is slowly
becoming my favorite hair color because
it has so many different options there's
so many different types of barrels so
I'll show you an example so you can go
from having like a really thin tight
ringlets or you can have a thicker
barrel which will give you on the
glamorous curl so today I'm going to go
in with one bigger barrel so that's the
if it has a number on it but it's the
biggest barrel in the set and I'm going
to use that today but then any set comes
with lots all sorts of different heads
and there's a really interesting one
that looks like that gives you different
textures there's thin ones which will
give you more ringlets
there's tapered ones which will give you
sort of a thicker to thinner a thicker
sorry a bigger curl to a much more of a
ringlet and so yeah the newest that's
awesome gives you so many different
varieties of curl
depending on what you're going for but
yeah so like I said today I'm going to
go for the biggest barrel in the set
because I watch that big bouncy curl so
you're going to cook it in and then
you're going to turn it to lock it
so that's stuck in there and then again
so I'm going to section my hair off into
two sections so the hair color comes
with a glove as well which is really
hard you put it on a bone your hand so
I'm just going to put my oil so I'm
going to take quite large sections
because I don't want anything to ring
liddie and I'm going to just curl it
around the wand
and hold it there for about 10-15
seconds
and hold it for about 10-15 seconds and
so I'm going to keep grabbing sections
of similar size maybe some a little bit
smaller some a little bit bigger to add
a bit more texture I'm going to hold
pieces for about 10 to 15 seconds and I
can and you can also switch the way as
you wrap your hair around the barrel
just to give it again a little bit more
texture I'm gonna repeat these steps
just around my whole back
actually I'm going to take my
Schwartzkopf f down through join
on this one and from that from below I'm
going to be scratching my parents
friends in this way through so here I'm
using the lustrum set which includes
five different interchangeable barrels
which is great because it gives me so
much versatility in what I want to do
with my hair
however I do have a few discount codes
for you guys to get your hands on some
of the other new products on the website
so if you use the code Sammi Robinson it
will get you the Titan 3 for $99 that is
100% titanium with three interchangeable
barrels and that gives you and a variety
of size choices to create lots of
versatile curls as well otherwise if you
use the code loves Sammy you can get any
curling wand for just $49 plus a free
microfiber hera so if you weren't after
having a set of curlers and didn't want
the variety in sizes and you were just

that code and get the one one for four
dollars plus the free back remote
three microfiber hair wrap so yeah I'll
leave all the details for that down
below so be sure to check out the

that once you've um once you've killed
it and sprayed it and sort of bunched it
up you're left with this loose sort of
beachy hair it's nothing to wring the
tea and begin to fine but it just gives
you nice balance and it just adds a
little bit of texture into your hair so
this is the hair I've sort of been
swinging towards lately if I haven't
slipped my hair back because I know I'm
a sucker for slipped hair but as my
hair's getting a bit longer I love to
add sort of really just beachy light
waves into it and I think it just gives
it some nice touch make sure you guys
