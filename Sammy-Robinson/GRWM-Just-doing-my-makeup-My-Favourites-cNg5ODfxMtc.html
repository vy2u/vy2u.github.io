I really small hang on let me adjust
this a little bit apologize for the
background I'm filming in my office and
it is a complete pigsty I'm currently
building an Ikea drawer here I've got
all the boxes that can't fit in anywhere
there
I've got crap everywhere today the
purpose of today's video is just do a
chilled out get ready with me I haven't
done one of these in a while obviously
I've been super busy hardly wearing any
makeup at all and today I really want to
feel my favorites video so yeah so it's
not a makeup tutorial it's just to get
ready with me using some of my favorite
products at the moment anyways let's
just start getting ready so I'm just
gonna prep my skin first off with my
favorite moisturizer at the moment which
is the clinic Moisture Surge extended
thirst relief this is my lifesaver when
I was traveling in New York I'm like
almost empty it's like a literal drink
of water for your skin it's like a gel
consistency but it's so hydrating I
thought as well in this video that I use
a few of the products that are actually
gonna be in my favorites video because
that way you guys can actually see it
sort of performing could probably go
through like eight tubs of these so now
I'm going to jump into the clinic even
better glow a light reflecting makeup
with SPF 15 I haven't been wearing
makeup very often recently but I took
this Foundation to New York with me and
I used it everyday but the reason that I
love this which I'm sure you guys know
is because it's a light to medium
coverage it doesn't feel cakey on the
skin it's just been one of my absolute
favorites at the moment but I've got
such a large color range I'm pretty sure
there's like a 30 27 or 27 or 30 or
something shades in the range yeah it
just makes me look super super glowy and
healthy which is my favorite went to the
clinic event and they were telling us
all about it and it has like light
reflecting pearls in it it has pretty
light has like exfoliating beads that
exfoliate your skin over time so it's
supposed to be like good for your good
to wear this foundation for your skin
over time which is always a plus you
guys would die if you were in Sydney
right now like it has been so hot and
has a mess
been that nice of weather eather it's
been quite um some days have been sunny
but it's mostly been quite cloudy and a
little bit rain even but the humidity oh
my god I've been sweating buckets
recently so this foundation lasts which
is cooled which I mean I feel like this
would be like if you're the type of
person that likes to wear your
foundation to the gym which I personally
diamond I might just wear like a seed or
something but if you are this would
really work for you now I'm going to use
my favorite Sigma concealer the lose the
halo lip concealer just so weird but I
love it it's my favorite concealer I
want something a little bit more heavy
duty
obviously I'll go with my heart-shaped
shapes so full coverage I use the
tiniest amount like I've been using this
every single day and look up how they
put a dent in it I'm so obsessed with it
this combination that I've been doing
recently is like a really nice
combination that's been making my skin
just looks super healthy and fresh oh
another favorite which is new I haven't
showed you guys either is this Gobbo and
Kelly palette which is you me and my
favorites as well and I love these three
and that one and I love it I haven't
used a cream contour kit in the longest
time yeah I like pulled it out because I
just couldn't find any of the bronzer
shades that were working for me like or
I just wanted to like try some new
makeup you know you just get in the nude
and you're sick of what you're using I
pulled this out and I was like oh I like
it
it's a good contour shade it's like not
so much bronzer bronzing which like you
guys know I love my friends thing but
I'm just trying to mix it up also I'm
not really sure how I feel about this
lighting
I loved my old room lighting I feel like
this one's kind of a my shadowy it's not
the best like it's not the most
flattering that's for sure when
everybody swap you guys to here oh so
much better
there's that damn IKEA shrubbery I can
smoke you know I can always tell when I
go from not filming sit-down videos to
film stuff yes I just like don't shut up
when I go to edit this video I'll have
like three hours of footage just of me
talking
such garbage and I never even put it in
okay now like on an everyday basis I've
just been setting my under eyes with
this the banana powder but because I
know I'm going to be wearing this makeup
all day I'm going to just bake it which
like you don't need to bake it but just
because I'm gonna be like filming a few
videos my eyelids have been creasing so
easily recently because of how hot it is
I just like to take whatever's left from
the powder on the beauty blender and
just like push it into like my sweaty
areas but the glam bronzed by L'Oreal
and this brush by Maybelline it's like a
big angle but quite dense bronzer brush
oh my god it's me my favorite runs a
combination it's I love this one because
it's like orangey I don't know I'm
really into warming the face up first
with that quite a warm toned bronzer by
the way it looks super pale on camera
right now but then I will show you this
Garbo and Kellie contour kit and I'll
just jump into this guy here which is
like the nicest contour shade can you
see how nicely blended the combination
of the two like the warmth and then like
a little bit darker but it's hot then
for the blush I'll take a little bit of
this one this is the most natural blush
shade I've ever used like it literally
looks like flushing cheeks how does a
super pigmented but not too overwhelming
that like you can't blend them out and
they're just like patchy and gross like
they're just the best formula actually
gotten back into my Becca opal highlight
and I mean my gold highlights but I
found this the other day where my sister
found it the other day and I forgot how
pretty it is I haven't used it in so
long so yeah I'm gonna use that today
I've been loving this palette I'm sure
so many of you guys have obviously heard
this before I didn't realize this was so
popular but I got it from Sephora I
didn't see modern Renaissance and I
stays yeah
is it a Nastasia but I've been loving
this shade here which is called raw
Sienna it's just like a really nice
bronzer
I thought that if that was a bronzer
like literally a bronzer for the face I
just have been running that through my
crease super simple
sometimes I don't do anything with my
eyes obviously these lashes are so crazy
you say don't ever really feel the need
to both are gonna run that same color on
my lower lash line I love it it's such a
good played because a lot of shades I
find a like feel a bit orange and I
don't really love orange I like Browns
Browns but this one has like the
slightest tinge of orange to it and I
love it this is the Charlotte Tilbury
full fat lash 5 star mascara and it
certainly is a 5 star mascara and the
reason I know that is because I went
obviously if you guys have been watching
my vids you know that I've been not
having eyelash extensions for a while
like I just got them put back on and so
I've been using mascara now me use my
max lip pencil didn't strip down over
draw this yeah my lips my favorite
lipstick ever of all time my favorite
nude the jeffree star celebrity skin I'm
just gonna have a little bit of the
Becca highlighter in my inner corner I'm
gonna do my brows quickly using my
benefit precisely my brow and just that
it all in place this definitely is
enough setting spray but this is the
herbivore rose hibiscus coconut water
hydrating face mist and I've been using
this like every small day and then
finally for my body be a Frank buddy
magic shimmer oil so I just take a duo
fiber brush put it in my hand and then
just like dip into it it's like golden
shimmering I also love the scent repay
finishing balm and my loving tan shimmer
shimmering that's a good shimmering body
whatever it's called it's that beautiful
and there we have it that's my makeup of
all my favorite products that I've been
loving at the moment so I'm gonna go off
now
so my favorite video thank you guys for
watching I hope you're having a lovely
day and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
