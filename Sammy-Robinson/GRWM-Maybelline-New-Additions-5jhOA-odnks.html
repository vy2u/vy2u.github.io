today's video is in collaboration with
maybelline labeling is one of my
all-time favorite drugstore brands is
not probably my favorite drugstore brand
and I've been using the products for
years and years new labeling was one of
the very first brands that I learned how
to make for sort of bought products from
but incredible quality products and I
just think that they do such an amazing
job with the formulas that they have so
I sort of have every recommends
Maybelline today to bring you guys this
video I've sort of done a 90s grunge
inspired makeup look using all of their
products and they are all such
incredible products my favorite
definitely being in the new dream
cushion foundation it is incredible so
lightweight so smoothing you can see how
flawless my skin looks so I'm so happy
to be showing this price with you guys
because you guys are going to love to
fly on my head you guys are going to
love it you have to try this product out
and so when I went to that event I sort
of wore a brown warm toned inspired
makeup look so I wanted to recruit that
look for you guys they award that night
in my slicked hair but I've decided to
put sort of a cool tone twist on it and
use sort of more cool tones this time so
if you would like to see how I got from
this to this then just keep on watching
so I'm going to start off with the
maybelline superstay primer and use it
as a base for my foundation it's a
really nice liquidy formula so that
it'll add a lot of moisture to your skin
but then also smooth your skin out I
love using primers I feel so wrong put
information on if I don't have primer on
okay so now for the star of the show
when it goes to my Maybelline Dream
cushion foundation this is so awesome
you guys
I have it in the shade son beige I also
have been using the shade sand as well
and it's so good I never find a
drugstore foundations that really match
my skin tone and this one matches me
perfectly it's awesome so I'm sure you
guys have seen me sliding around all
over the place the cushion foundation
a lot of brands have come out with their
Christian foundation Mabley makes such
incredible foundations it's one of their
best products I find so I just take a
little bit on my business when it comes
into contact obviously and I just start
to push it into my skin as any guys you
know like actually so you guys can see
so this foundations probably I'd say
medium coverage but super buildable so
you can make it full coverage if you'd
like so I'll just read you guys a little
bit higher so that I'm in the frame
roughly it's so comfortable on the skin
that I can't even feel like I'm wearing
it to be honest and it's the easiest way
to apply foundation I always watched
those cushion compact videos I would
thought it looked really hard to use but
actually so easy like I thought that
this would be awful but so easy it's
like just as easy as a Beauty Blender I
find my favorite thing about the
foundation is probably that it has an
SPF of 40 I like my foundations having a
bit of SPF in it because here in
Australia we have really really harsh UV
rays and if I'm being honest I always
always forget put sunscreen on so it's
really good that it just has the SPF
protection in it for me so that if I
forget it doesn't matter this is my
ideal everyday foundation for sure
because it's so easy to use it's so
compact and it does have the protection
in it which I just think is perfect and
I just probably have smooth it makes my
skin look can you guys see that I've
used a really really light layer of it
and it's perfectly evened out my skin
tone and I just look so smooth it's so
luminous and it's so fresh and vibrant
as well I love it I just do now jumping
into an old favorite I'm using my
instant age rewind dark irate duck so
called her razor it's so great because
it's full coverage but so lightweight
I can't this like probably the thinnest
concealer I've ever tried I'm just going
to use that to sort of highlight the
center portion of my fences though a lot
how you always forget how good a product
is until you come back to it and you
just fall back in love with it so good
the Maybelline event that we went to
with
well done you guys wanna see me because
I've logged it the food and drinks
everything was amazing and Nigel the
headers makeup as a director of makeup
for Maybelline was down he's just the
funniest guy ever who serval areas how
about you before because I went to
Fashion Week of Maybelline so I just the
second time I had seen him and he's just
like such a funny guy now we use some of
this master striving stick by Maybelline
of course this is so awesome as well
okay so you know how I absolutely love
my josie maran argan Enlightenment lose
it illuminating wand well this is like
on par that it's got the most creamy
formula it's incredible often I find
with cream highlighters or like sort of
stick highlighters that they quite tough
and hard to blend out this is like a
dream it's so easy now I'm going to go
in with some Maybelline translucent
powder this is the shine free loose
powder in 0-1 light and I'm going to
fake my under eyes you guys know that I
like baking my under eyes now so kind of
just become part of my routine now is
good and I'm going to take a bit more of
that powder and just sort of dust it
over my t-zone I love love love this
product
it's the Maybelline a face Studio zero
one belongs and it's a bronzer and then
it's got sort of like a highlight
anything there I love just swiping it
all together in one and just bronzing up
my whole face with it and I'm not going
to contour or anything so this is just
adding that light amount of dimension to
my face and while I have the bronzer on
I'm just going to dip my blending brush
into it and just use it as a transition
shade in my crease
I just think bronzers make the best best
transition shades mix everything on that
you put on top so much easier to blend
okay so continuing on with the eyes I'm
going to do something kind of cool toned
so I'm taking to be a Maybelline in the
nudes palette but here I've got gorgeous
cool tone shades I don't run a bit of
this
a through my crease as well just to
start making it a little more cool taste
sort of as a second transition shade
going to take this cool tone brown shade
on my finger and I'm going to pack that
all over my eyelid now I'm going to take
this darker shade just beside it and I'm
going to run that through my crease and
deepen up the outer corner so I'm
focusing most of the product on the
outer corner and blending it in words I
like to look super grungy I'm sort of
deepening up the color as I go again I
sort of smoked out smokey eye but really
subtle but if that makes any sense now
I'm going to take the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I have sort of like
a few eyelash extensions less they're
very sparse but I'm just going to sort
of trying to even them out with my
natural lashes I love this mascara so
add a touch of color to my cheeks I'm
going to go into this master highlight
and sort of highlight some bronzer so
it's not really a blush but as you can
see it's got lots of colors now I'm just
going to swirl it together so to swell
my brush in it and then just place it
over my cheek and supposed to be looking
a little bit deeper on my cheeks so now
I'm going to take my Maybelline master
our Pro palette one of my old favorite
they still use it all the time
and I'm just going to take the powder
which is the middle shade and it didn't
shade soft brown as well and I like to
do slightly a feather this through the
front of my brows filling in any sparse
areas and it's so quick so easy to use
so finally now on the lips I have to the
options I have be bold and audacious
lipstick in seven six zero gone grease
so it's like so a gray toned Brown and
then I have my color jolt a lipstick
sort of lip paint in 0/5 strip down I
think what I do look I want to go for
him to use this I'm so - really
really nice formula these lipsticks the
color payoff is just amazing so that's
the finished look I feel like it makes
my eyes look super blue so I think I've
enjoyed this video and he says
