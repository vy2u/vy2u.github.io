video is going to be my birthday makeup
as I suspected I didn't end up selling
it on my birthday I knew I was going to
be too stressed running around and
rushing but I kept all the things that I
did on my birthday sitting right here in
front of me and I'm just going to
recreate the exact thing that I do I
don't have the beautiful flowers in my
hair and I don't have my beautiful dress
on but I thought I would feel some this
for you guys in case you guys wanted to
see right before that say I wanted to go
for that really glowy dewy look which
I'm sure you guys already assumed video
is definitely not going to be a tutorial
on something new or something you
haven't seen for me it's just going to
be the exact products the exact makeup
that I do for I suppose really special
occasions and then I went in with a
little bit of the technique on the
central skin primer I love this tree as
much as as possible so on my birthday I
went in with my trusty now foundation it
is the NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation but because my tan has faded
a little bit I'm going to put a little
bit of the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation with it just do one pump of
it shape eyes look a little bit orange
to you guys but that's just because it
is for overcast outside and summery
silent overcast days I got a really
weird orange finish to my skin when I
film it's been so nice and sunny in
Sydney recently like lately it was
beautiful my birthday and today I was
not but it's the first sort of rainy day
in a long time as oh my god orange I
look I promise I do not look like that
in real life there with me it'll look
alright in the end so yes this doesn't
have all that much coverage but it's
just an evening out my skin tone that is
crazy we have now I wonder if change
exposure I'm sorry
we'll fix that up with concealer so I
went in with my trusty shave tapes I've
actually kind of started getting over
the show page because I'm running out I
think these are drying up a little bit
and it's not as flawless on my eyes
as I am used to so I just should I used
two shades I use the medium and then the
light medium but on my 21st I got this
beautiful necklace from mere can I got
some rings and a bracelet from my
friends and then I'm going to got my
ears pierced so good I already had this
ring and now I have two more one above
and one below I really want um a ring in
this one and then I'll probably keep
this top on at the start but I'll change
to like a crystal I've got to wait six
weeks so I've got these ugly huge studs
in my ear my bangles are just like
jingling sorry
see you guys that I love my cream
products I feel like I don't need this
right now just because I am looking or
any quite orange but I used my Clinique
chubby stick in Kirby contour I did use
my stealer cream blush in peony hear me
blush
flash looking a little baby pink flowers
in my hair so I want my makeup to
resemble this flowers I saw some
pictures here you guys to see my my hair
and my what I wore and my makeup you
can't really see my makeup all that well
but you can just say that it's really a
sort of glowy and quite neutral and
flushed so so yes I definitely love how
everything turned out it was such a
beautiful day I was so lucky but weather
was stunning and when I was planning my
21st a few months ago I really don't
want to do it in July I don't want to do
it in winter because I'm not a winter
girl summer girl and I was like I want
to wait for the warmer months just
postponed a little bit and it ended up
just being the most beautiful weather
like them not the most perfect weather
it wasn't too hot it was just the Sun
was shining in it was just so beautiful
I then went in with this car tray part
of the sea radios dropped it fits around
it very it's doesn't give you that like
highlighted look but it does give you
this crazy radios I'll show you guys my
Beauty Blender the side of my Beauty
Blender and just put a little bit on my
cheek here consume it just gooses like
it looks glossy almost beautiful is
almost like an oil or something
you see this yeah glass I think guess
that's the best way to describe it
people shiny oily glass how it's funny
how we just like angry oil and shiny so
then when it actually is your natural
oil you like you like blockage of to
fine and because of the de thing I know
what is my makeup to last as long as
possible
I definitely baked my face I just went
even with my trusty Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just baked my
under eyes and I don't leave the bacon
just like sitting on my eyes I actually
just like to push it into my skin I push
it into the foundation it is just like
really sad sitting place and then I also
just set my chin smile lines and like
the center of my forehead just to modify
those areas because my makeup was on for
probably like 12 hours and I just wanted
to make sure that I was looking at
flawless as it possibly could I also set
my eyelids because I did wear quite a
bit I shadow
whatever brows my normal Renee and so
that I've used a billion time you guys
probably security me is my precisely my
brow pencil and I don't know why usually
I stick to what I know on big special
occasions but I felt like I wanted a
little bit more of a defined brow on my
birthday because I've been a little bit
more into the defined brows so I
actually went in with mica brow which is
like more of a pomade
I missed I'm gonna skip pretty sickly
over this though so let me know if you
guys want to see a browser toriel I'll
probably use this so if I do the brow
tutorial because this is the one that I
use everyday but yeah I'm gonna just
speed through this
and then I went in with my gimme brow to
set that in place whose just keeps my
brows a little bit as well I know why
but I don't know if it's like an age
thing but my eyebrows have been fading
like blonde recently obviously not
blonde but like a lot of the hairs have
have gone a lot lighter and they don't
look as full anymore so I started using
tinted brow gels just to make them look
a lot fuller again so now for the eyes I
went in with my Z palette which I
stopped using this is so long and I
always seem to come back to just because
it's like all the shades that I love and
I sort of custom created myself back
when I bought these so so long ago so I
started off with this color here which
is frappe from makeup geek and then I
also mixed it with chickeny which is
this orange color from makeup geek as
well I'll see you existed actually look
at the orange anymore it's really orange
before so yeah I just took a big fluffy
brush loaded it up with those colors and
I just run that through my crease so
then on the same brush I just took this
pink shade down the bottom which is
called cupcake from a cupcake I really
likely just run that right over the top
just because again I have two pink
flowers in my hair and I just had baby
pink touches to my outfit like I've
heard the baby pink nails so I just
wanted to sort of tile the Pink's
together sorry I'm looking into that you
find out I haven't I haven't sat down as
build and makeup tutorial in so long so
I feel like whenever I do go back to
filming them I'm so rusty the first one
I used was actually creme brulee then I
went into frappe which is this color
just here favorite makeup geek shade and
I just put this right on the outer edge
and I hardly moved it I pretty much just
put it there and didn't even wonder
really you know me I love my lifted I
look to the perfect day to be filming
because I wouldn't be outside and I'm
not feeling like I'm missing the Sun so
I sure enough to be sitting inside and
playing with makeup when you're good
folk in and out of phases with makeup
and that's why obviously I haven't been
doing so much as many tutorials because
I really just go through phases of
wanting to play with makeup and sit down
and film and then I just don't like
wearing I don't like it on my skin very
much like I don't like the feeling of it
so I then get the same brush into mock
up and this is where I post it again but
like basically dotted it like pretty
much just dotting it just dabbed it on
there and then I do take the original
bit blending brush and I do just blend
that out it really hit home to make my
party to tell lofty I am I've got such a
beautiful strong family and such amazing
friends and such an amazing boyfriend
and today I'm going to dinner with
Nick's family
I love Nick's family so much for trying
to suck I just the way both to a family
oriented and the fact that we both love
our family so much it's just so special
to me
yeah I really has good to do this right
and then for my lid and my inner corner
I took champagne pop which this is the
one that has the blush in it but I just
took this shade here and I ran that all
over my lid and in my anti-tax the party
was a pretty crazy party though day
drinking I don't know what you guys
actually probably you guys would feel
the same is just it just gets to people
my god like drinking from 1:00 till
10:00 p.m. at night just eyeless and
emotional record other kinds of speeches
cuz the speeches were so beautiful of
kind his presence and friends but at the
end of the night all my friends lifted
me up and started dancing I was like dad
you guys like ball with my eyes I like
such a little sweet surprise my face up
a little extra I have been loving my
master buns from Maybelline and as you
guys know I'm part of the Maybelline
while it moment is that I've been trying
basically all the labelings makeup and
days touchet's at the moment as my Bruns
up I like to take like a big fluffy
brush and I just kind of just dabbing it
doesn't again into the first two shades
and I just really bronze up my outer and
the outer parts of my skin I'm so off
contouring at the moment I really just
love that glowy look very pigmented
though so it should be like super
careful really warm up the skin with and
it has like a little bit of a sheen in
it so it gives you like a bit of a glow
at the same time oh my going to have
picked up a little bit too much of the
product and I ran it down my nose like
this and it like fully did like a
contour of my nose like at all my photos
I just got this like orange nose but I
can't loved it because you can think I'm
crazy but I'm going to put another layer
of blush on as well because it was my
birthday and I wanted to put as many
products as I could on my face so I
wanted my blush to stand out so so I
used this beautiful baby pink blush ring
royal it's called South Beach and it's
just like such a cute little Barbie pink
and yeah it's red not all over my cheeks
it's like a Barbie pink but like a baby
Barbie pink so it's not too crazy I've
always told you guys I'm not the one to
do that crazy intense highlight on the
cheek I've always liked a really subtle
highlight
I love highlighter just a little amount
of it but on my birthday I went crazy
with the highlight I said I just used
the champagne pop again because it's
such a beautiful Goldy shade and I just
went to a town and champagne pop you can
build up and make like almost metallic
it's like so different it's a keeps down
my nose almost too much so my nose
people a little bit hell is on my face
peeps on my shoulders and on my
collarbone that's why I love daytime
things whenever I go to daytime things I
just love it on the highlighter just cuz
it glistens it just looks so beautiful
in radiance but for my lips I went with
my classic lip combination but the lip
liner is new so I thought I would tell
you guys about this this is the Victoria
Beckham Estee Lauder lip pencil in zero
one Victoria so I guess it's just half
shade and I love it it's a beautiful
neutral brown color so I do a line
directly under my lip line I don't
actually do it on either side at all is
my Jeffrey Fowle is a lipstick in a
celebrity skin I just wanted to go with
what I knew and what I loved so and this
is just my favorite nude lipstick I
really don't like wearing with of the
six I find them so uncomfortable but
this one is the only one that is just it
sits on my lips it's so thin I could
hardly feel it it stays on for so long
and even if it does wear off it's almost
a neutral enough or and close enough to
my lip color that you don't see it as
you don't get that staff line there so
then to finish everything off I took my
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray I
just love it because it sinks in all the
powders into your base and although I
don't have that many powders on my face
it just melts them so yeah that is my
final makeup look let me know if you
want to see more makeup tutorials from
me and or even favorites where I can
show you those new favorites new
