about me how about we do making heart
you may try to find something to believe
because I'm honey while night running
free still got a lot of have to see
snuck in this town and the town stalking
me I was trying to find another reason
believe it I hope oh over one day I'm
Hazzard we know cause I'm stuck on the
pad I'm trying to feel on top
you shouldn't everything will just come
to a stop hi guys welcome back to my
channel so welcome to my last video of
2016
crazy it's been such an amazing year
I've taken on YouTube full time now for
the moment so that is so exciting I'm so
excited to start 2017 and start pumping
out heaps the videos here you guys just
the most amazing feeling to be able to
do something that I'm obsessed with and
I love and do it for my job so I can't
thank you guys enough for this year I've
had the most incredible year and it's
all due to you guys so for my New Year's
look I've cured this dark navy blue look
for you guys I hope you like it
something very different for me because
I never really wear dark eyes also to
dress it off a bit I thought I would
include a beautiful little dress from
sister's label sisters is my absolute
favorite dress brand if any years I'm
just chilling with my friends we're not
doing anything too extravagant we're
just having a little house party so I
thought I would grab myself up for this
video but you guys know I love sisters
the label so I do have a discount code
with them I'll leave it down below if
you guys are interested so yes um
without rambling on too much let's just
jump straight into the video and I will
see you guys next year
okay so excuse the bags under my eyes I
am
exhaust said I had like a full sleep
last night but I've woken up with like
the puffy face so we're going to start
off with the Charlotte Tilbury wonder
glow in instant soft focus this stuff is
incredible it's like the Laura Mercier
radiance primer but it's a little bit
more golden so it suits my skin tone a
little bit better okay I fixed the
lighting it was a little bit orange so
now I'm going to go into my Becca aqua
luminous perfecting foundation in the
shade beige so you just shake it up and
then it is a dropper so you just press
the button and you pick up some
foundation pushing that in with my Real
Techniques Beauty sponge so now I'm
taking some of my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade medium neutral
and I'm going to conceal the bags under
these eyes and I'm just taking the other
side of the beauty blender to blend that
in and I'll bring up on my eyelids as a
primer as well so now I'm taking my
clinic Koby contour chubby stick umm and
I'm just going to bronze up the outer
parts of my face I'm going to take my it
cosmetics heavenly luxe flawless
foundation brush to blend that in this
brush blends in cream bronzers so well
you don't even have to do anything it
just does it for you so now on a night
out I will always set my concealer with
a translucent powder and just make my
brows it just ensures that the concealer
doesn't crease it's the best way I think
so I just want to get rid of any
creasing do I loose well the bake is
there I'm going to move on to my eyes
just so if we get any fallout we can
swipe it away with the powder that we've
already placed down okay I hope you guys
don't mind but I have to turn my haircut
on only here like a light breeze coming
out of it it's just so hot in this room
so I have to I have to
aircon on so starting out with lunar and
Isabel just a mixture of the two
transition shades into my crease and I'm
going to blend it quite far up this
palette is super pigmented so you don't
even need to pick up all that much and
it's like so blendable
so I'm going to be more of Isabel up
just to warm up the crease
now just picking up a smaller blending
brush I'm going to go into Violetta and
just go a little close down and on the
outer V
now I've no idea what I want to put on
my lid I know with blue eyes this color
is so beautiful I'm going to do this one
for New Year's Eve why not
I'm going to pack that on my lid I'm
just messing packing it on right now and
we'll blend it all in in a second
and with the darker shades like this you
just want to pack it on then you want to
blend the edges and then once you've
blended the edges you go in and pack it
on again
maybe it got more violator and blend
that into the blue
so now I'm going to swipe the Bakke away
now for the lower lash line we're going
to basically do exactly the same thing
I'm going to start off with the blue
though this time and I put that right on
the lower lash line so you start with
the darkest colors and then you'll make
your way out with the lighter colors as
a transition down the bottom and now I'm
going to take a bit of the orange and
I'm going to blend that underneath so
that it has the same symmetry from the
top to the bottom and you want to just
smoke it out
Fifth Avenue princess and I'm going to
use that on my inner tear ducts and on
my brow bone
so now taking my steel a huge extreme
lash mascara I'm going to put a light
coat of mascara on my lashes
okay so that's the eyes done I take a
bronzer I'm taking my terracotta Terran
Magnifico bronzer by Golan beautiful
warm toned bronzer this is such a
beautiful bronzer look at the packaging
it's so stain
I'm gonna take my rhodiola
contour powder really cool toned Bruns
up I'm using my Luxor face paint brush
by zoeva now I'm going to take the most
beautiful highlight palette I just got
sent this the other day it's by Garbo
and Kelly and I've never heard of their
brand before but it's an illuminating
highlighting kit most stunning shades in
her so I'm going to take this top
highlight shade just here you guys know
me I don't usually go for an intense
highlight but I feel like New Year's is
the occasion for it so let's see how
this goes oh my gosh
oh whoa my camera doesn't pick it up
very well because I'm just using natural
lighting but that is crazy pigmented
let's put it on our collar bones too
I'm going to take my clinic lipliner in
the shade intense blush
and now I'm going to take my current
favorite liquid lipstick which is by Kat
Von D in the shade bow and arrow
that's the finished look oh no wait
eyebrows Garbo and Kelly also sent me a
eyebrow pomade and an eyebrow brush so
I'm going to try it out today this is in
shade cool blonde yeah that's the most
perfect shade for my eyebrows that's
really easy to use as well because it's
really pigmented but it's not too
slippery so it's like really easy to
make straight lines that's awesome
gobble and Kelly have great products are
gonna heard of them before
well the matter Aamir's will take their
um eyebrow gel it's just clear but it's
