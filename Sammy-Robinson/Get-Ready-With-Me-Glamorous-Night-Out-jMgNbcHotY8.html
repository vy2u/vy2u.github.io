but you ain't looking at no one oh you
think about a chance you find stuff
trying to do my things
maybe I'm just going to start off with
some glam glow lip mask because I think
I'm gonna wear a liquid lipstick so I'm
gonna start with a lip mask or I've
already moisturized and cleansed my skin
but I'm going to do it again with my
like I'm Celia's Ellis mild moisture
cream I've been doing a new skincare new
skincare regime and um I've been loving
it but I'll keep you guys updated on
that soon I've been using for the last
like three weeks I'd say it's a Korean
skincare brand so it's supposed to be
very good and so far I love it
Wow man oh you see bad Beach so I'm
going to use my NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation this is the
foundation I always went to event it's
like this is probably like my Holy Grail
foundation and I use it in the shade
Sara coos Syracuse I just love how full
coverage it is um but how thin it is I'm
just blending that in with my Beauty
Blender I would like to go to full
coverage with the foundation because um
I hate feeling like I've got foundation
on my skin but I do go tend to go quite
heavy with
concealer this is more just sort of even
at my skin tone so now thank you my
favorite concealer at the moment the
Smashbox Studios skin 24-hour concealer
in light medium I've got so much cat fur
in my room right now so I'm just like I
think I'm just
I've got like so much fur on my face so
tonight Nick and I are going to Henley's
Maxim top 100 or Maxim's top 100 I think
it's um I believe it's an event
celebrating like the top moon in
Australia so I think mug margot robbie
one or um which I'm not too sure but
it's supposed to be early a really fun
party so because I've got a bit sunbed
the other day foundations not sticking
on my skin very nicely okay so I'm just
going to take a bit of my Laura Mercier
translucent loose powder and I'm going
to bake my under eyes I definitely like
baking my under eyes and like parts of
my face when I'm going to events because
it keeps your concealer looking super
flawless and it will definitely not
budge throughout the night then I'm
going to set my t-zone as well this is
like the most like sweat proof way to
set your makeup it will not budge if you
said it with like a a damp sponge and a
translucent powder it's like crazy
I've been so obsessed with my la girl
Pro concealer lately for cream contour
but because I just put a bit of powder
on it doesn't blend as easily through
powder so I'm going to take my Clinique
chubby stick in Co V contour and I'm
just going to bronze up the other parts
of my face a little bit so I'm going to
take my hourglass ambient lighting
palette um this is the one I custom-made
for myself in LA and I'm going to take
radiant light and luminous light so
these two and I'm going to dust that
just all over the rest of my face this
will set down set down the palette with
and also make sure that you're not
completely matte it burns up my skin now
using the Laura Mercier that Reyes baked
powder in bronze it's just like a nice
baked bronzer we've got new lighting at
the moment I've got a ring right here
entering that here because my other ring
light broke and doesn't work anymore and
so I've been trying to figure out my
lighting and it's been such a massive
hassle because I filmed four videos I
haven't uploaded them for you guys
because it was really really yellow like
I know this is probably still appearing
semi yellow as compared to my other
videos but like I just heard me what it
was about my old ring light but it just
didn't it was like amazing and I really
took it for granted because now I'm just
like honestly I filmed so many get ready
with me so every time I've been Alex
I've been to three events this week and
I filmed you get really with me every
single time and I guess it it's because
it is kind of it gets kind of dark
outside so it's a little bit harsh
lighting and goes a bit yellow on my
skin because it's my natural sunlight
outside but god it's so frustrating I
can't even tell you so now I'm going to
take my contour spectrum palette from
zoeva which is just an appellate with
sort of pilot shades and contour shades
and I'm going to contour with this top
shade just here
and I'm taking it on my zoeva luxe face
paint brush oh yeah
luxe Peck face paint brush I'm just
going down the sides of my nose as well
and on my jawline I take my Charlotte
Tilbury cheek to cheek blush in first
love it's just like that kind of looks
like a nipple the theme of tonight's
party is a touch of gold so I can't not
use a gold highlighter I'm taking the
Laura galas and highlighter in gilded
honey's a blue texture
I've got weird bites all over my body at
the moment and it's really frustrating
because I've got a few on my face as
well in this so itchy and I know if I
each it is just going to get bigger and
worse and it's like really frustrating
on my face but like it's so itchy I
can't knowledge it so got them all over
the side of my cheek and it's just so
annoying is also when you get bites on
your face looks like pimples way so I'm
going to use my toddler in bloom palette
and I'm going to go into smarty pants as
my transition shade
and now I'm going to go into rebel which
is a show just here and just deepen up
the outer corner I just like to place it
down first and then I'll go back in and
blend it out so I've been going to the
beach quite a bit lately I'm so so keen
that it is summer it truly stuck it
truly feels like so many offers all my
friends how to exams and now they're all
starting to finish so we're going to get
starting out a lot more and enjoy some
we're going to go the pub Lots and go to
the beach heaps and bring some drinks
and have picnics and Sunday session
barbecues I'm so excited and I'm going
to go into leader which is this shade
here
um yeah anyway back to my lighting I'm
sorry about the lack in content I'm
super into it and I've actually been
filming so much I just haven't been
happy with what I have filmed and I'm
not going to put like bright yellow
videos on my channel I don't want to put
that's my dogs barking of course yeah I
just don't want to put some of them
unhappy with up on my channel so I'm
came to just keep filming until I get
the right lighting just figure it out
certain time of day I'm just still
trying to figure it all out I think I'm
going to put a funny girl which is the
shade down here just on my lid and just
blend it all together and I might put
like the tiniest bit of I might with a
tiny bit of Isabel through my crease as
well just to warm it up a little bit
just so that the gold and the orange
kind of match I would have put some
lashes on now there my my lashes from
autumn is um I don't have the packet or
anything still have used these so many
times but I'm just going to do this off
camera so see you in a sec okay so yeah
like I said I'm wearing the Artemis
lashes but I'm really sorry I'm actually
not sure what style they are because
I've worn them so often now I've been
wearing them to all my events but yeah
or they've sent me a whole bunch of them
all the Artemis lashes are beautiful so
yes so nuts so now I'm just going to do
my brows using the anastasia dipbrow
pomade in blonde um I don't really feel
in my brows that hardcore I just just
like to define the
Edge's a little bit I'm just doing this
boss areas a little bit I think I might
put a bit of shadow on my lower lashline
eyebrow goals not really needs a lesson
on how to fill in my eyebrows so I'll
probably just take a little bit of rebel
this shade just here and run that on the
outer part of my little lash line smoke
it out a little bit
I don't usually touch my lower lashes I
just think when you're going a little
bit heavier on the eye makeup it's
probably necessary I'm also going to put
a bit of mascara on my lower lashes as
well
this is bobby brown eye opening mascara
now we do my lips I'm going to use my
hourglass lip liner in panoramic again
this is my absolute favorite lip liner
at the moment because I'm not going out
a little while I'm not going to put my
lipstick on yet because I find liquid
lipsticks can be quite uncomfortable but
um when I do get when I do whom I live
on I'm going to be using the Kylie
Jenner lip kit in Dolce K so yeah it's
only like 4 p.m. now so I'm not going to
get ready for a little a little while
but that's the makeup done I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will see you in my
next video
can I be close to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
