you so much for watching today is the
day after my birthday so I had my
birthday yesterday it was lots of fun I
went out with the family and had a good
old time but today I'm going out with my
friends so I'm just gonna go for a few
cocktails with the girls so I thought I
would just film a get ready with me so I
have no idea what I'm going to do but I
have a few makeup products from Max's
start off with my primer from Too Faced
the hangover primer and I'm just going
to do a few pumps on my face so now that
I've primed my skin I'm going to go in
with my NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation in the shade Tahoe I usually
mix this with a lighter foundation but
because I have a spray tan I got a spray
tan for my birthday I am just going to
use this shade because it matches my
skin at Mercy I'm going to throw in my
round top kabuki brush with my Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
I'm gonna dab that on the back of my
hand so there's no excess watery liquid
on it and I'm going to buff that
foundation into my skin so after I'm
done with my makeup I'm going to go to
my hairdresser called hair bar and I'm
gonna get a few like curls just put into
my hair just for something different
because I always have straight hair or
slicked back hair I very rarely put
curls in my hair and I love the look of
it I just can't really do it myself so I
am going to go pretty heavy on the
highlight though so I'm going to take my
naked skin concealer from urban decay in
the shade light warm also putting it on
my chin
and a little bit on my forehead this
will just give us a little bit more
coverage as well as highlight our face
so I'm going to take the same brush I
use for my foundation and blend all that
in
now I'm going to quickly set my
highlighted areas with my AC onto a
contour and highlighting kit and I'm
going to take a mixture of the banana
and the pink shade I'm going to set
those areas
now that it runs up my skin a little bit
more so I'm going to take my Coastal
Scents angled brush and my Mac's
mineralize skinfinish in it give me Sun
I just use it as a transition shade for
my contour so I'm going to place this
down and then take a more dense precise
brush and that's when you go in with a
more gray toned bronzer and you carve
out your cheekbones and the hollows of
your face a little bit of my nose so
like I said before I'm going to take a
more dense brush and I'm going to take
my Bahama Mama bronzer by the barn and
I'm going to carve out the hollows of my
cheek bones
and I'm going to take a little bit of
that onto my forehead just the side of
my forehead around my temple area and a
little bit down the sides of my nose so
now for blush I'm going to take a really
pinky shade I'm using my NARS blush in
deep throat and I'm going to put that on
the apples of my cheeks and blend
upwards above the contour I haven't
chosen an outfit for tonight yet so I've
no idea I'm just doing a really neutral
makeup look so that I can pair any
outfit I want with it but I think I'm
just going to go with a simple out with
out out winter I think I'm going to go
with a simple outfit with a leather
jacket over my shoulders or something
like that and a nice pair of boots or
something and of course I'm going to
highlight so I'm going to take my Becca
highlighter in the shade of opal of
course and just this large powder brush
from Ecotools but it has a nice sort of
fan shape to it so it fits in there
really nicely wow that's a lot tap off
the excess product so you don't kind of
disco ball but today I'm definitely
going for that glow I'm going to take a
tiny bit on the tip of the brush and run
that down the bridge of my nose and on
the tip of my nose of course
my Cupid's bow and a little bit above my
eyebrows
just everywhere just take em just run it
all of your face I would if I could but
I wouldn't be able to pull that off so
the face is done for now I'm going to
take my Urban Decay spray again and run
that all over my face I don't know why I
just like to basically drown myself
enough stuff it makes me feel so fresh
so now I'm moving up to my eyes I'm
starting as always with my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and I'm going to take a
synthetic brush dip that in there and
run that all over my eyelid please get a
mirror and I'm running that all over my
eyes to set a nice base for my
eyeshadows and of course I'll be setting
that with the banana shade from the AC
on to a contour and highlighting palette
I guess so so before I move on to any
eyeshadows I'm going to do my eyebrows
I'm filming an eyebrow routine tomorrow
so I'm not going to conclude my eyebrow
routine in this video again but I will
be putting one up very shortly because
I'll feel much more Oh ed etre and then
put up whenever I can so I'm not going
to include it in the video again but I
will be right back and then we'll do my
eyes so now I'm moving on to my eyes I'm
taking my Smashbox blue eyes palette
it's really dirty so excuse that but
it's got really nice neutral shades and
they great for blue eyes and I'm going
to take theirs know your names so I
can't tell you but I'm going to start
with this peachy shade just down here
and I'm going to be running that in my
crease
I'm then going to take a more precise
brush and this shade in the middle and
I'm just going to deepen up my crease so
when I go to New Zealand I'm going to be
getting eyelash extensions I have had
eyelash extensions since I was 14 so
I've had then for about five years on
and off obviously I don't have them now
oh my god I just dropped my Becca opal
highlight oh thank god I literally um
yeah but so I've had eyelash extension
since I was 14 on and off like sometimes
I've had them once a year sometimes I've
had them six times a year like I go
through phrases with them but I am going
to be getting eyelash extensions for my
New Zealand trip because it makes life
so much easier and then finally I'm
going to take the darkest shade just
here and I'm going to be running this in
my outer corner so I'm going to be
elongating my eyes today so anyway the
reason I'm telling you about my eyelash
extensions is let me know if you want a
review on eyelash extensions because I
have a lot of experience I've had them
for about five years and a lot of people
are really unsure whether to get them
because they think their eyelashes are
going to fall out and never have
eyelashes again what's going to hurt or
anything like that so if you want an
eyelash extensions review or you want me
to answer any questions about eyelash
extensions leave any questions in the
downbar below and I would be happy to
film that I'm also going to take this
middle shade here and I'm going to
on my lower lashline oh hello whoo
you're so white and glowing so I'm going
to take sweet satisfaction and I'm going
to run that all over my eyelid
I'm not going to take the carefree shade
I'm going to run that carefree shade
right in the center of my eyelid and in
the inner corner just to really brighten
that area up
and then take your blending brush and
just blend it all together and I'm going
to go into my natural eyes palette and
pick up the shades expresso and I'm
going to line up line the top lashline
with this dark brown just to give some
definition into the eye so now we're
going to take some of my they're real
mascara I only have the test the size of
it but it still has heaps in it so
that's good and I'm just going to put a
little bit of mascara on my lashes just
because I am going to go in with falsies
afterwards so now that the eyelashes are
on I can go back into my eye shadow and
see what I really want to fix up around
the outer corner of my eye so I'm going
to go back into my Smashbox palette and
pick up the darkest Brown down the
bottom and I'm just going to lightly
extend this outer corner and mimic a
shadow of the lashes we have on so I can
see where the lash ends and where I want
that outer corner shadow to end as well
and I do it while my eyes open so that I
don't because I have a hooded eyelid I
don't do it I'm closed and then open it
begone I want to do it on the area where
my eyes open sorry if that didn't make
sense so now that the eyes are time I'm
going to do my lips I'm taking nice and
spicy and I'm just going to line my lips
and I'm also going to fill them in with
this lip liner as well so I'm really
happy with that color I'm gonna stick it
stick it like that I'm gonna stick it
like that I'm going to add a little bit
of gloss though this is our glass lip
Gaussian child and I'm only going to add
that to the center of my lip so that's
the end of the makeup I'm now going to
go get my hair done at carve hair bar
just get a few loose curls put into my
hair I will then put my outfit on and
I'll show you the finished product
