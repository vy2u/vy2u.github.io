this is a very strange strange feeling
because I feel like I have not sat down
here and going to dump you in a very
long time I've been all over the place
I've been in LA I've been to Coachella
I've done other things I don't even know
but I just haven't had the chance to sit
down and fill the makeup tutorial but I
really really craved sitting down and
just doing a sit down video I've been
obsessed with my vlogs as always I think
that's my favorite video to do but I
really like I woke up today and I was
like I'm really craving it filming it
sit down make up video yeah let's just
jump into it and see what we come up
with excited I'm filming off a new SD
card and it's a 64 gig so I have no rush
often with my Lexie standing by or even
30 you like so I was like no space I was
really very clearing it so I feel like I
can talk to you guys hours and it won't
matter
I have no idea what they're from but I
got them from Coachella I think it was
from some of the jewelry I was wearing
one of the tops maybe I did wear a tight
top around my neck yes don't know what
they are we have as long as they're like
directly symmetrical on my collarbones
but other and then one will find that I
know the light is going to keep dropping
in and out sort of the afternoon now and
decided going behind the cloud so yeah
there's not much I can do about that but
hopefully we'll be okay this has been a
new favorite of mine the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I bought it in
America and I think it was like 20 to 30
dollars cheaper than in Australia and I
just never I don't know I've just never
gone and bought it but I do that's
always there and it is definitely one of
my new favorite foundations so if you
can see my face is a little bit
different to the body but I feel like it
was and we're here okay one is my new
favorite concealers at the moment is the
SAO double wedding sealer
I just really really like the
lightweight products and this one is so
thin it actually kind of reminds me of
the urban decay I would have called it
Decay Naked skin concealer it just from
see a lot of that inconsistency but this
one does not crease at all and I can't
tell you guys like at Coachella the
whole time is so bright and sunny I just
constantly like be intimate I have quite
I do this naturally in the Sun and
always look so angry so I thought that I
would have the most wrinkly face by the
end of the day and it just it just
didn't sink into any of my life so I
don't know if you guys can see but it
just makes my skin look so flawless this
foundation and concealer combo all right
but I'm going to a cream contour with my
fatigue chubby stick now there's some
Nevers I'm going to lose the Sun all
together actually to Daddy
Shirley oh I think it's just getting
cloudy I'm going to set my under eyes
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
so to bronze up my face i'm using my
bronze goddess by Estee Lauder this has
been my favorite obviously I've been an
American been using it but it's just
been my favorite thing ever to bronze
with so yes I've been back from
Coachella probably like three four days
now and I've just sort of slowly been
getting back into the swing of things
I'm editing and uploading my Coachella
vlog which obviously will be asked by
the time you guys see this but I'm doing
that tonight I felt like really hard to
edit sometimes I get in a role with my
editing and I find it really easy and
like I love it and really enjoy it and I
can Det get it done quite quickly
and some solutions to get stuck in a
massive rut and I can't figure out a
sequence to how I'm editing it but yeah
so I'm editing that when it's gonna be
up tonight but will already be up so
I'll link it down below we use my
metrics with medica highlighter this is
such a blinding intense highlights
really good solar blinding
I've been so obsessed with the nose
highlight lately it looks so pretty for
some reason so we're drawing attention
to it but I don't like it
so now I'm going to do my brows using my
spot girl take a brow brow pencil and
brow mascara
got the brow pencil on that side and
then you unwind it and it's got like a
setting Scout I think you're so cool and
very travel friendly so this pencil soro
easy to use like phenomenal to fill in
the eyebrows I've been going for the
bolder brow lately so I've been trying
to create like an actual shape to them
instead of going like more fluffier than
China I really like define them this
pencil is literally the perfect color
for my eyebrows i pickle and then now
I'm just going to set them in place with
the mascara on the ends brush them
upwards and downwards on the end so now
onto the eyes I'm going to take my Too
Faced sweet peach palette and I'm going
to pick up puree oh my god that smells
so good picking up puree I'm just going
to run that through my crease I'm just
going to do like a light transition
shade because I want to do over the
dramatic wing so now I'm going to take
my vodka gel liner it comes in like a
little liner kit and it comes with the
brush as well which I'll use and I like
to just draw the warm line connect the
top of the line over here I'm not
picking up that much product on my brush
either just because if I go to black
it's hard to take off so I just pick up
tiny bits of product when I'm just
tracing it and then I'll go in and pack
heaps heaps more of it afterwards when I
want to fill it in
as you can see all sort of just pasted
it down there and then now I'm not going
to go across so it just kind of let's
lift the eye a little bit and I just
like it on the edge there okay so yeah
just pick up way too much of the product
at that time and it just instantly
that's why I like to stencil on in first
because there's just like too much
product my bad
now I'm just putting the coat of mascara
on just really lightly I feel like every
little smoke this wing out now so I'm
going to take go back into my sweet
peach palette and then take this dark
brown at the top here we really want to
smoke this out I'm just placing it like
directly on top of the liner and just
diffusing that line so you want to bring
it the brown on top of the liner diffuse
it out and then sort of sweep it through
the crease as well and just keep
blending until it looks just like super
smoked out and I'm just going to keep
picking up product as I go and making it
darker and darker just stick on the
outer edge don't take it into don't take
it in these areas I'll just go right on
the outer edges let me show you guys one
of my everyday live combinations at the
moment so I've been using my hourglass
panoramic lip liner in Eden this is
definitely my all-time favorite nude
liner if you guys are looking for a good
sort of darker nude and there's so many
of you guys have asked me in the heaps
of my photos and videos like most logs
and things what my lip color is been and
it has been this Sportsgirl
lip chalk and it's a matte lip cream but
it feels like it sort of just feels like
a liquid lipstick and it's in the shade
inverse ago I didn't I didn't realize
I've been telling you guys about ages
I'm like it doesn't have a shame matte
shade name on it but it actually does
like right in there
Vertigo's so this one is just my
ultimate less brownie dark mood so it's
time to decide my favor symmetrically hi
Tristan that's my favorite the
combination at the moment as well like I
mean I've got heaps my other favorite is
Jeffrey star a celebrity skin I think
because it was caused by down I got hate
for the fix gently one of my favorites
and a lot of you guys keep asking my
photo so I thought I would show you guys
that in today's video that at the end of
the look after you guys enjoyed it I
definitely love how it turns out and
I've just inspired myself to do this a
lot more in that doubt I haven't done an
eyeliner smokey eye look in a long time
yes as always I will link everything in
the description box for you guys and
that's why knees tell you I think
there's anything else so I love you guys
so much thank you for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
