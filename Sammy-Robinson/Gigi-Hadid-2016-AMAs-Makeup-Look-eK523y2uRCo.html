but you ain't looking at the world
oh you think about a chance you find
stuff trying to do my things maybe cuz
you love me
hey guys
so starting this look off with freshly
cleansed and moisturized skin and we're
going to jump straight onto primer I'm
using the Laura Mercier radiance primer
Gigi had a really gorgeous radiant
complexion so I'm using that in order to
sort of glow underneath my foundation
and then I'm jumping onto my Becca
foundation this is the aqua luminous
perfecting foundation in the shade beige
and I'm just taking my Real Techniques
Beauty sponge and just blending that all
over my face it's a little bit light for
my face but once I put my bronzer and
everything on I feel like it'll arms
together pretty well so now I'm taking
my Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in
the shade medium light and I'm just
highlighting the central point points of
my face
and again just blending that in with my
Beauty Blender Gigi was very contoured I
found from the pictures that I was
referencing she had a lot of contour and
bronzer going on so I wanted to make
sure I highlighted the center of my face
just so that the contour would pop more
so then taking my clinic chubby stick in
the shade curvy contour I'm just doing
this to more bronze up the outer edges
of my face because my foundation was a
little bit light so this is just adding
a little bit more dimension and then I'm
taking my Watts up by benefit it's just
a highlighter it's a cream highlighter
and I'm beginning to highlight my
cheekbones and the high points of my
face
so now to set my under eyes I'm going to
be taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm going to bake just my
under eyes and then I'll be taking some
hourglass powders that I sort of
custom-made for myself and I was in LA
and I'm just going to dust all those
shades over the rest of my face just so
that we can make sure we keep that
luminosity to our skin and then taking
my ambient aluminous bronze light from
our glass i'm bronzing up the outer
perimeter of my face a little bit more
but then i'm also taking the shade and
i'm running it over my cheeks in the
place that I would put blush I couldn't
really tell if Gigi was wearing any
specific blush shade so I felt like it
looked pretty bronzy but then to further
contour i'm going to take my zoeva
contour spectrum and contour with that
top shade this will just further define
our cheekbones as Gigi was pretty pretty
well contoured
now for highlight I chose my Becca
shimmering skin perfecter in the shade
opal because I found that Gigi was
wearing um not silvery but quite a light
champagne shade so that I found that
this was perfect for that and then I'm
just brushing my eyebrows upwards with
my Rimmel brow this way brow styling gel
I'm not putting any product in my brows
because Gigi tends to keep hers quite
natural and fluffy but just making sure
to brush them all upwards now for
eyeshadow I'm taking my morphe 35o
palette and I'm starting off with a few
really warm shades in the crease because
from the pictures I referenced I saw
that there was a lot of warmth in the
crease higher up and then as it came
further down and became a bit cooler in
tone and then also she had like sort of
a silvery shade on her lid so I'm
beginning with a orange transition and
I'll begin to sort of wing that outwards
as well out towards my eyebrow she
really really elongated her eyes so I'll
just begin doing that as they get darker
with the shades so I'm sort of just
taking the same brush and just picking
up lots of different shades and
beginning to deepen up the crease and
that outer corner shape that I want so I
mean you guys can probably just see what
I'm doing better than me try to explain
it but I'm just bringing it in all the
way to the sort of inner part of my
eyebrow and all the way to the outer
part just to continually deepen the
crease and just picking up darker shades
as I go so yeah I'll just just let you
guys watch what I'm doing
so then I'm picking up a smaller more
densely packed brush and I'm beginning
to draw that out of me that she has my
eyes and not nearly as um sort of lifted
and I don't know how you'd say it not
squinty but just likes quite that sultry
look so I'm trying to do that myself
with eye shadows and then I'm just
picking up a few of the same shades that
I put in my crease and just running that
under my lash line as well she has a
sort of smoky lash line but then mostly
just a lot of mascara on her lower
lashes so just adding a bit of shadow
there and yeah just tying all the shades
together so now for the lid shade I'm
going into my mac prolongwear eyeshadow
in Carefree and I'm just packing this
all over the lid I didn't have silver in
my collection because I don't wear cool
tones ever so I sort of just custom
created my own lid shade so it's really
light as if it was a silver but it's
more of a champagne e shade so then I'm
taking my gorgeous cosmetics eye shimmer
in sand
I think it's sand summer over the top
and just lightly dusting that and then
just blending it all together so
it's not exactly the same but it's sort
of just my take on Gigi's look and then
I'm using my Clinique chubby mascara and
just coating my eyelashes with that she
had pretty long wispy lashes and I know
that she was wearing eyelashes in the
photo I went off but um I'm just gonna
take a few sort of half individuals and
stick them on that these are the Urban
Decay urban lash ones and I'm just going
to take two sets of the clusters and
just put them on the ends of my lashes
now I really struggled with her look
because as you can see in her in in this
photo that I'm showing you it's sort of
a like pinky shade in the middle and
then maybe like a red on the outside but
I think just in different lights it
looked kind of different so I'm just
going to start off with my Urban Decay
glide on lip pencil in bang which is
sort of an orangey true red and then I'm
gonna put my urban decay lipstick in a
Zed cream and that was to red so I took
my covergirl lipstick in two three Oh
cream and I put that on the center to
create that ombre look that she had so
yes I know that it's not identical but
um that was sort of my take on it so
that's the end of the makeup look I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did I'd love
if you could give this video a thumbs up
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
