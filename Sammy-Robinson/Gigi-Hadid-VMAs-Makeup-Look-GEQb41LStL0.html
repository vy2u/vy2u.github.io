you so much for watching so today I have
created a GG hadded inspired makeup look
I get so many comments from you guys
saying how much I look like GG I am it's
the most common comment I get out of
anything I've ever had so I thought
wouldn't it be convenient if I filmed a
GG hadded look and I've been looking at
a lot of her makeup lately and trying to
figure out sort of the makeup look that
I wanted to do so I saw her walk on the
stage of VMAs and I was like blown away
I was like this is the look I'm doing
she looks incredible
like when she walked on the stage I was
like oh my god when people tell me like
oh I'm so flattered but like I saw her
and I was like oh I look like that no no
oh I definitely had to recreate this
look for you guys I hope you like how it
turned out I didn't have anything orange
in my closet so I'm wearing this so it's
kind of nothing like her outfit but what
can you do
so yeah if you guys want to see how I
recreated Gigi Hadid's VMAs and please
keep watching to begin I'm going to
prime my skin using this bareMinerals
prime time foundation primer it's the
brightening and illuminating one um yeah
so I'm just going to frame my skin so
for foundation today i'm using the
l'oreal lumi magique foundation because
it's quite a radiant foundation and i'm
mixing that with my jane bronze shimmer
instant illuminizer and just to add a
bit more of a like an illuminating look
to the skin so I'm just going to mix
them on a flat surface picking a Jessop
brush this is from ebay it's super cheap
and I'm just going to buff that into my
skin
off this video is going to look like I'm
not wearing at all
Esther armor it'll it's just slowing
down because it's go
so I'm now going to take my coverfx
contour kit in deep and I'm going to
pick up the shade number three just down
here and I'm going to bronze up the
outer perimeter of my face using this
color so I'm not contouring or anything
I'm just adding a little bit more color
into the face just because the main
focus of GG's look was just bronze enos
so we're going to go as Brad bronzy as
we can I'm now going to be taking my
josie maran argan illuminizer and I'm
just going to put that on the high
points of my face so on that my
cheekbones a little bit on the tip of my
nose and just down the bridge of my nose
on my Cupid's bow a little bit on my
chin and on these points just above my
eyebrow so just up here now GG didnt
have any extreme contouring or
highlighting it was just an overall sort
of bronze enos to the face but I am
going to conceal my under eyes so I'm
using my L'Oreal JH r yeah L'Oreal True
Match concealer in the shade number two
so vanilla and I'm just going to
highlight underneath my eyes using this
it is way too light for me but I do like
to have really bright under eyes because
I'm always so tired so I like to really
brighten that area up making sure to put
it on the inner corner as well to really
highlight that area and I like to put a
little bit on the bridge of my nose and
on my chin as well just to make sure
your face sort of balances out it's not
just right underneath your eyes and I'm
going to take the same foundation brush
and I'm just going to buff that out
using that brush
so to set those highlighted areas I'm
going to use my ACM tool contour and
highlighting kit and I'm going to take
the banana shade and I'm going to set
the places we can field and just make
sure that we keep those areas nice and
bright going to set the eyelid because I
did place a little concealer there and
I'm going to use that as my eye base so
you want to make sure before that crease
is just to set that down to and to set
the rest of the face and use my
hourglass ambient lighting powder in dim
light and I'm gonna set the rest of the
face so I'm going to take my Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and I'm
going to go into the shade peanut butter
which is this shape just here
and I'm gonna run that through my crease
so Gigi had a very simple eye makeup
look she had a little bit of depth in
her crease with a bright lid and that
was it so she added some lashes so that
was it so we're not going to do anything
too dramatic just run a little bit of
this shade through our crease just to
give it a little bit of depth
gonna take the smaller table earning
brushing just as well with the same
color and I'm going to run that on my
lower lash line here now just with my
finger I'm going to take butter pecan
just this shade down here and I'm going
to run that all over my lid
this is the most stunning color it's so
pigmented I'm now going to take a little
bit of this gorgeous cosmetics I shimmer
in the shade sad summer I think it's
rubbed off a little bit so I'm pretty
sure it's cooled down some up it's just
like a shimmery pigment and I'm going to
take that on my finger and just Pat it
on the center of the eyelid just to
really brighten and open up the eyes so
one last time just take your blending
brush and just make sure all those
shades are blended out you don't want
any harsh lines you want have to be
really seamless and effortless in my new
Sigma are monumental lash mascara does
such a good job at like making your
lashes humongous and I'm just gonna run
a I really like code battery members to
have a sky club I have my lashes just
because I don't want to make my lashes
big and full I just want to make them
black underneath their false lashes that
I'm about to apply I'm now just taking
my Ardell glamorous beast I took them
out of the packet and already more than
once so they're just really wispy lashes
but they're quite natural at the same
time Gigi had um lashes on but they
weren't anything too heavy or black they
were just really nice and wispy so
that's the lashes I'm going today and so
I'm just going to apply these lashes off
camera just because I feel like this
video is gonna be really long already so
yeah I'll be right back so Gigi didn't
have any bottom mascara on in any of the
photos that I've seen so we're just
going to skip the bottom of mascara for
today and move on to the face so I'm
going to take my mac mineralize
skinfinish in give me Sun and just a
Coastal Scents s27 brush it's just a big
sort of powder brush and I'm just going
to bronze up my face
don't be shy on the bronzer for this
look she has such a bronzy complexion
that yeah I don't know where I was going
with that so you don't need to be
specific with the placement stick to the
outer perimeter of your face but yeah
just bronze all over really I'm then
going to take my Sigma Melo powder blush
wait can we set her again I'm then going
to take my Sigma powder blush in Melo
and I'm just going to put that on the
apples of my cheeks it's a very bronze e
shade I'm pretty sure it actually might
be a bronzer but I don't want to use any
Pink's or anything on the stick
completely on the Bruns aside of colors
so I'm just going to use that as a blush
I'm going to run that over the center of
my nose center of my forehead just give
yourself a really sunkissed look and now
for highlighting we are going to go
crazy on the highlighter i'm using my
becca shimmering skin Perfector in opal
and don't judge me i'm going to go a
little bit crazy I'm using just a Jessup
duo fiber brush
I love duo fiber brushes to apply
highlighter because it's not too dense
so I'm going to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones
the tip of my nose and a little bit down
the bridge of the nose on my chin
I hate highlighting my chin but I'm just
going to do it because Gigi is glowing
that much up again where the highest
points of our for it is just above the
eyebrows Pittsburgh
I'm just going to take my finger and
just pack a little bit more on the tip
of my nose and put a little bit between
my eyebrows pull too much too much oh
and I'm also going to take that
highlighter on my collarbones
and a bit on the apples of my shoulder
what we even have apples in the shoulder
just on the tips of my shoulders now I'm
going to go into my mary-lou manizer and
I'm just going to use my finger and I'm
going to Pat that right onto the very
high point of the cheekbone
some of us can open out some viewers but
some of you are going to think this is
way too much and that's okay you don't
have to do it I just really want to go
for that Gore I'm going to take just a
little angled brush and I'm going to put
that on my brow bone I still need to do
my brows crap and I'm going to really
pack that on the inner corner as well
look is lips so I'm going to start off
by lining my lips with this world Mac
lip liner it's Mac lip liner in well
and I know I shouldn't support this
brand but I'm going to use a lime crime
lipstick just because I've already
bought it and I may as well use it if I
purchased it um and this is the closest
color i could find that i had of gigi's
lip color so because I don't own many
nude nudes I have lots of brown dudes so
I'm going to use this lime crime
lipstick in Crowe okay and just put that
all in my lips I'm then going to take my
hourglass lip gloss in the shade child
and I'm gonna run that all over my lips
as well and then to finish off the whole
look I'm going to go in with my NYX juhi
finish spray again and I'm just going to
spray that all in my face so that's the
finished product a lot of the have
another product remember all my engine
my eyebrows well so I completely forgot
to do my eyebrows I'm gonna go in with
my anastasia dipbrow pomade and my Sigma
angled brow a 75 brush and I'm just
going to quickly do my brows but I'm not
going to do much to my brows because
Gigi has quite soft fluffy brows anyway
so there's not there wasn't much
structured to her brows so I am I'm
basically just going to take a little
bit of product and I'm just gonna flick
it
look it up words too much definition so
we don't really need to define them I'm
just gonna flick my brows up because why
not I'm then gonna go in with my Loreal
brow plumper and I'm going to run that
through my eyebrows this is a little bit
lighter than my brow so hopefully
that'll lighten my brows a little bit
more like GG's and I'm brushing my
hair's completely upwards because her
hairs were brushed upwards so I'm gonna
brush my head's upwards so that's the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
I'm sorry it's a really long video
because I used a lot of products but
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I don't
have anything else to say except I'll
see you in my next video and I hope you
have a lovely day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
