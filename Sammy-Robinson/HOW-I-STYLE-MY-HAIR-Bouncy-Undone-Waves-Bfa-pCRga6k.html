today's video I am finally going around
to showing you guys how I style my hair
I don't know why it's taking me so long
I feel like it's because I'm not that
great at hair my technique is kind of
random because I used to have short hair
and I got so used to sucking my hair
back I kind of just never styled it
myself but recently as you guys can
probably tell from my instagram pictures
I have been styling it like a non-stop I
thought it's finally the perfect time to
actually show you guys sit down and show
you how I properly do it it's a bit of a
random technique so bear with me another
reason that I wanted to do it was cuz I
just got my hair dyed so it looks kind
of frizzy right now because I've just
blow-dried it but I just got a little
bit more lightness put third just cuz
the top was quite dull and so in doing
so the bottom is a little wider as well
and I believe the technique was Belliard
and highlights but I don't know it's hot
outside today to get my hair the way
that I want it looking I actually use a
hair straightener and I find that no
matter what hair color I use my hair
drops immediately but when I use my
straightener their curls stay for like
three days so this is what I'm going to
be using today so grab yourself a
straightener I always use no matter what
is the ght it curl hold spray now I
sprayed this before actually comb my
hair as well so just kind of drenched
the ends so when you put the coat spray
in as well I like to wrench the ends and
then it dries pretty quickly so don't
worry about it being white cuz it pretty
much just dries in the hair and what's
that what that's gonna do is act as a
base and so when you curl it it kind of
just holds it in place and like locks
the curl in place
okay so sorry my headset cut off but I
want to be able to show you like the
hair because it's about the hair I use
the HD gold hair styler this is my
newest one so I got some things all the
time and this is th they are so kind and
send me all of their products so I love
to get to have used it forever forever
like it's one of those things that when
you're a kid you know just bank your mum
together for Christmas but so
I'm gonna be using this one today the
cold styler it's amazing it is so smooth
it makes your hair so freakin shiny just
leave it that point of this tutorial is
not to have your hair looking good today
I do this the day before so I've got an
event tomorrow that I want my hair done
for and so I do my hair the day before
but I want the look of the curls to drop
okay so I take a section just about this
big like that and that thin and then I
take the it's straightener now you have
to watch because I don't really know how
to explain this very well so I take it
and then you kind of just like wind it
up in your hand and like let it drop you
guys are gonna laugh at me because I'm
not good at explaining and I'm not very
good at my head this is just what I do
and what that's gonna do is like today
it's gonna be quite regularly but
tomorrow it's gonna create that really
bouncy blow-dried effect that you know
the Victoria Secret bouncy waves but I'm
gonna come back tomorrow and show you
guys exactly what I mean but you just
pull it over the top and twist it down
hopefully you guys can see what I'm
doing always brush to get the hair
smooth and then you start from the top
or Midway pull it over the back and pull
through and glide down as if you're
straightening your hair and then it will
create this ringlets so here's how we're
looking just ringlets and then I just
grab the bottom bit so let's look that
over brush and I see your comments
asking for these videos and I'm not
trying to ignore you guys but I'm sure
now you can see why I haven't done it
I'm not a Herricks but all you
hairdressers are probably cringing at me
right now but I just do what I do you
know
my cousin Annabelle actually told me
this years ago and I remember when she
was trying to show me I was like what
are you doing I didn't understand it at
all but it's easy to pick up once you
get the hang of it okay so you just grab
another piece like this and I do it the
holder the same direction the whole way
through and the reason that I like to do
it in big chunks is because I don't like
my ringlets to be teeny tiny and like I
like big bouncy waves the look that I'm
trying to mimic is when a hairdresser
blows blow dries your hair and puts it
up in rollers and then she takes it down
and it's those big gorgeous glamorous
waves that's what I like I don't like
the really little beach waves I'm not
into that
so this is how hair is looking now but
then I also I don't brush my hair now so
leave the ringlets as it is like these
leave them as is
don't brush it out and I will check back
in with you guys tomorrow and show you
exactly what I mean oh good morning guys
okay so I always keep my hair in these
things this is is looking like the next
day so as you can see the ringlets have
dropped dramatically and it's just more
of like an undone like boy dress do you
I mean like it's so hard to explain but
flicky look as opposed to curls you know
what I mean and this is what I mean when
I say I look it as well so I don't I
don't keep it in the middle part I
generally will keep it like this I hope
that you guys have enjoyed it let me
know if you guys try to home I want to
see whether your hair does the same
thing because I don't know whether it's
just my hair that holds the curls well
but when I do it like that the next day
it does this and then the following day
it's a little less voluminous obviously
in a little less curly but still keeps
that keeps the flicks so it just does
this for like days and it's the only
thing that sort of stays in my hair this
seems to do the trick for me
anyways hello so I thought I would show
you one last final day is the third day
before I'm about to wash my hair of my
curls so
you can see they're pretty much all
fallen out its literally now just the
kink I hope you guys have enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
