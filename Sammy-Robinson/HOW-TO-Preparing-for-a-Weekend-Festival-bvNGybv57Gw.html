top from Janelle pants to skirt from the
iconic and my Nikes like really casual
and simple but just really comfortable
because I'm going to be laying down like
an hour change to songs because my feet
have elected back in the car yet again
so right now I'm just off to get my
eyelashes infield I decided to get
eyelashes one more time I've only had
them once this time but because I am
going to be going to a festival this
weekend the start of this vlog is sort
of me showing you my festival prep and
what I'm going to be doing to sort of
get ready for a festival so I'm really
excited to sort of figure out what I'm
going to be wearing and dressed up as
something so I thought I could just film
following me around while I prepare
myself for a festival so first step is
getting my eyelash extensions done means
I won't have to stick any on and worry
about mascara running the theme of the
festival is Secret Garden so it's sort
of like he does very mystical creatures
you can just dress up as whatever you
want really piece of glitter sparkles
it's really really exciting
I've ordered hair extensions online
someone have really long mermaid hair
and I've wanted hair extensions for ages
anyway so I thought this is the perfect
opportunity fully rambling now I'm going
to stop rambling go get my eyelashes
done and I'll show you guys things for
an office where I go I'm going to anneal
it in your pleasures absolutely no
reason
yeah let's go get my life success is
done probably go you to console to use
and okay so I also got a sorry we missed
you from the both of us so I'm going to
head to the post office after my
eyelashes and pick my path up so as you
can see they're very very far so anyway
glasses on because I look like a dirty
mall rat I'm now going to get these on
my path so I'm really hoping it's my
parcels I'm princess Holly the case that
has so many exciting toys that I want to
show you guys but it could potentially
be some other parcels but either way I'm
going to go get some lunch and so I'm
gonna go get my pack solid hunt I love
my lashes that I go through I went to
just dilash eyelashes I just try to out
for convenience absolute since because
is easy for me to get to and it's
incredible I love how Kelly they are
that's good so that's true now I don't
have to worry about we lashes on or too
much eye shadow or anything I'm just
worried about my skin makeup and heaps
of glitter
I got my coffee and my favorite salad of
all time
yep time to go home and get some
organizing done hello okay so now that
we're home I sort of just wanted to run
by the things that I already had packed
and let you guys know sort of my plans
so what Professor is going to be the
first day I'm thinking of going is a
ferry because the theme is royal so I'm
thinking princess fairy I don't really
have anything royal so I'm just going to
dress as a fairy and pretend I'm a
princess fairy so yes that is my plan I
don't really have anything pat for it
but when I do end up finding what I'm
gonna wear I will show you guys
so I said I've already have my nails and
my toenails painted I'm not going to do
any of the prep for the actual day until
tomorrow so I'm going to wash my hair
tomorrow shave my legs tomorrow tans my
because it's all on Friday and
tomorrow's Thursday so but today I'm
just going to sort of try and pack all
my clothes that won't be sort of costume
so I have lots of comfy clothes to wear
when we're not in the actual festival so
when we go back to the tent you want to
make sure you have lots of jumpers and
track using comfortable clothes to get
into clothes for glasses I'm bringing my
ray-bans and because these are new and
quite expensive I'm making sure to bring
one of these that will go around my neck
so that it sort of it falls off it'll
just wrap around my neck and then a case
to protect the glasses when I'm not
wearing them because we are in a tent
and you could step on them and things I
have these jewels this will grow as a
body chain this is a choker this is
another choker option let some hairspray
that is sparkle so I don't want to
change the color but maybe some sparkles
throughout my hair these in case I don't
even know since it's in case and then
lots of tattoos no reason other than
because it's dress-up and I can so I'm
just going to gather my toiletries now
so I'm going to show you the essentials
that I will be bringing I'm not going to
bring too much because there's not
really any point but I do want to make
sure I am as clean and I feel as fresh
as possible so these are sort of the
essentials as you guys would be well
aware I'm sure I have a deodorant a
hairbrush hair ties these are my
favourite hair ties the ones that are
sort of twirly like this they hold in
your hair like and other elastic so by
bringing this code peri and coconut body
gold shimmer spray so I'll put that all
over my body it's just a really
beautiful gold charm a toothbrush
obviously and toothpaste and then for
skin care I'm going to bring my face
wash but then I might not be able to use
it because I don't know what the
bathroom is like so it's very essential
for me to have in my fella water and a
full thing of cotton around just so that
if I can't wash my face at least I can
take my makeup off with that and then
obviously you're going to be doing a lot
of partying so you want to make sure you
bring a moisture
and a lip balm this is my favorite lip
balm of all time it's called Knoxville
nooks I'm not sure how to pronounce it
but obviously the most important thing
is sunscreen so and 100 can bring a
whole bowl of sunscreen and then I like
to just bring any face mist so this
one's by Jean Jacobs it's just a really
hydrating face mist it'll just make you
feel a lot cleaner and fresher but when
you can't wash your face and I was
different a little sort of hairspray
thing this one's sort of empty so I'll
try and find another one but this has
been my favorite thing ever at the
moment to use this hairspray after I
tell my hair okay so this is just sort
of just thrown together what I've done
so fast I'm not sure if I'm missing
anything but I wanted to show you the
general gist of what I'm going to be
bringing for makeup so I usually go with
radiance primers but because we need it
on all day and of taking my it cosmetics
bye bye pause primer so that will
mattify my face a bit and then some
foundation I'm going to be taking my
Maybelline Dream cushion foundation
because it has an SPF of 40 and I'll be
sort of out all day long my concealers
I'm bringing my tart shape tape my
powder I'm going to take my royal baking
powder the main reason I'm bringing this
one is because it's so tiny so for cream
face products and bringing my favorites
my curvy contour chubby stick by clinic
and my josie maran argan enlightenment
in luminizing ones speranza and my blush
I'm bringing my benefit hoola bronzer
and then also this stunning California
blush this is perfect for a festival
because so vibrant so my highlighter I'm
bringing my sports go on the globe
palette this highlighter is just
ridiculous and then I also have this one
if I want like a lighter Golda shade and
then for my tribal day I just thought
that this was a perfect these are my
Sportsgirl pigments this is my idol
makeup-wise you want to make sure that
the products that you're bringing are as
a lightweight as possible it is so
horrible wearing makeup all day at a
festival when you're hot and you're
dancing around and things and if you
like you're sweating your makeup so
princess Polly order has arrived that's
the dog that's the book how pretty oh
shoot
this is so beautiful they're like a baby
pink multicolor so I got a regular top
because I love my t-shirt beautiful rust
playsuit is Sammy edit all right skirt
what is placed at the shoot so
comfortable this would be perfect for
the festival I also thought that this
would be so beautiful to wear as well
definitely going to wear that so cute so
comfy clothes are definitely essential
to bring to festivals that are overnight
today so we have two nights there's so
two potential data to sort of hang out
in the morning so if it's hot I have
just a plain strappy singlet and some
shorts
so just brought my regular t-shirt just
to sleep in and have a comfortable
t-shirt for while I'm lounging around
and then if it's cooler I also have a
white t-shirt and then just sort of my
baggy poop pants and there they can be
sort of khaki army style fabric and then
obviously your bra and undies I'm just
going to bring one bra and then I'm
going to bring one strapless bra as well
I don't have it here at the moment but I
like to have both options features are
definitely essential as well so I'm
going to bring these portable speakers
okay so I'm sort of finishing off
packing at the moment I go spray tan
we're going to tell you guys out that's
another preparation that I like to do a
minute spray tan in ages actually but I
do like to have my breast as I just ate
chicken crumb peas that's so sad but yes
I like to get spray tans um if it's sort
of dressed up or if I've got like a
weekend away
although otherwise I use my loving tan
in case you guys are wondering what time
I use but this is a spray tan I was just
really lazy and I can't afford to do it
um it's really annoying though because I
don't all my peoples are gone but
because I got a spray tan it's all stuff
too like the dry patches looks like i'm
pimply and yeah well I need your
sleeping mat and you need your sleeping
bags you need some s keys lastly we have
a shopping item so I've just been to the
shops and I've just got a whole bunch of
things popcorn by the way crackers I got
some band-aids some face wipes shapes of
course Greg it's already coming out so
exciting and then yeah I got some mixes
so I got some driving drill and stuff so
that's a thing that I've done there is
just sort of an add-on to what we
already had the others went shopping and
they got like essentials like maracas
panadol nothing goes for the morning
bananas you want just some apples things
you can snack on that aren't too bad for
you because obviously we have our shapes
and trips and stuff as well but you're
going to be hungover probably if you
drink like I'll be drinking um so it's
good to have Baraka good to have heaps
of water good to have juice things that
will make you feel better so yeah okay
so for my extensions in then my makeup I
just gone for like a natural fairy like
a bit glittery glowy makeup look for the
first day because I don't really have
too much of an outfit it's just like a
long red skirt and a white singlet so I
would keep it pretty simple for the
makeup um
tomorrow we're probably going to do
something a little bit darker so yes
this is my first time playing extensions
mmm
/ - the preacher we're going to be
packing the car now putting everything
away and we're going to be leaving so I
think I'm just going to end this video
here I'll show you guys obviously the
tents in the footage from some of the
footage from this but let's go to the
festival got the whole boot packed out
for a little bit late everyone else's
already and itself the tents but now
we've made it from good touch
they're probably rub off pretty pretty
well straight away but
