doing today's video because I'm doing a
haul I feel like I haven't done haul in
a long time I just love watching other
piece of holes and clothes the day yet
so I want to show you guys what I got
also its side note I stuck my hair
extensions into the vid my next going to
be going read from this choker because I
haven't worn jewelry in a long time you
guys know when I went through that phase
of wearing my little style necklace and
I had to love how in the moon I lost all
of them when I went to America oh we've
met all my favorite pieces of jewelry
ever so picked myself another one and my
skin is so sensitive that whatever is on
top of it goes a little red so don't
mind that that's not the necklace does
peel in my skin yes I do just want to
jump into this hole and start showing
you guys these amazing pieces that I got
I got a range of jewelry glasses makeup
and clothing just keep it kind of
interesting so yes of course I have a
discount code see you guys is princess
Sammy I think princess Sammy and it's
going to get you 20% off which is crazy
good I will leave all links to
everything that I've got down below in
my description box plus their link to
their website if you guys want to go
have a look at other stuff let's just
get on to the video I guess first of all
start off with what I'm wearing and I
will start off with the choker probably
one with everything for the pictures you
guys know obviously like I said that I
wore my style on all the time I always
got questions from you know asking where
it was but it's always sold out so this
cute little one is in stock and it's got
a moon and a star on it
excuse my redneck but it's got a moon in
a little scar pendant off it and it's
really delicate the reason I love it so
much those because it's rose gold I wear
gold or rose gold I've got got broker
Watchers belt everything like that just
going to work with all my other jewelry
and that's probably my favorite part
about it and then second thing is that I
am wearing is obviously at this top i've
only two more three of my videos it's
kind of freezing in sydney well freezing
for us I'm not used to freezing cold but
if I went somewhere that was actually
told I would freak out but so Sydney is
really cold at the moment so I'm just
sitting inside in this thing that top is
so comfortable it
really nice a woolen fabric it's a
really gorgeous rosy muted pinky color
and I just love because of it I think
it's just really really flattering it
doesn't go too low that it's too busty
so I'm going to go through some of my
glasses now because I picked up the
coolest the funkiest glasses the first
pair gonna just match my outfits so well
how cool are they obviously there are a
few festivals going them out and Splenda
is going to be I think it's in July so I
just thought I'd give you guys some
festival inspire with these glasses
obviously they're not used for the Sun
they're obviously an accessory I just
love the pink with the gold frames I
think it's such a cool shape and
somewhere the low down on your nose you
have to look through them everything not
to shade your eyes from the Sun so
that's the first pair of glasses I got I
got quite a few pairs of glasses guys I
couldn't choose so I got quite a few I
got the same pair of glasses in the
actual glasses I just think it's the
coolest shape probably would never
actually wear these as sunglasses like
up here help we get people in winter I
just love the look of wearing a pair of
glasses like this with you know your
little hat leather jacket jeans boots so
it's kind of again an accessory they're
not really used as glasses but yeah I
just lots of gold frames as well so I
got this next pair of glasses because
I've gone through a phase of buying lots
of little round glasses the classic ones
obviously being the ribose which I have
now I've got the proper ray bands but I
want to get these to show you guys that
these are a really nice little copy
obviously rare bands are really
expensive a lot of people don't want to
spend the money because they're quite
easy to break and I'm quite clumsy so
I've just been really careful with my
ray-bans
but I got these just to show you guys a
cute option if you guys wanted something
like the river I think they're so
similar it's like ridiculous but almost
like a little bit bigger which for me I
really liked because they suit any
outfit their suit any look any hair
starting to flip your hair back to where
I was going to advance the title with
what you wear and where
and I just think they're so flattering
on so many different bad shape I
actually almost like this shape better
than my ray-ban last time I was up on
the Gold Coast supply gave me this
awesome a pair of them we went to that
double trouble tour and I got these
which I just love but then so this time
I order another pair this color is
really cool like a belly Irish glasses
got the tab on it now about insert shop
for you guys wearing them these are
probably the coolest hi kids I reckon
that she's brought out and I think this
is such a great classic stand in shape
of glasses it's you know the aviator
style but a bit bigger so it looks a
little bit different so does this to the
glasses and now we move on to some
makeup Geoffrey star celebrity skin
lipstick which I get from princess Polly
so if you guys know good employee stocks
Geoffrey star I've never really tried
much as jeffree star cosmetics
I really have ever tried this lipstick
and it's my all-time favorite nude
lipstick so I'll link this one down
below as well if you guys are interested
in trying this over so I picked up three
things from princess Polly I picked up
the jeffree star cosmetics skin frost in
Eclipse
in Siberian gold so those are the colors
right there I have to say this one's my
favorite cuz I will really love of gold
highlight but this one would be a really
great neutral that would just suit so
many different skin tone but yes these
are so beautiful there are a little bit
glittery compared to a lot of the other
highlighters that I use but I haven't
probably given me the go I completely
forgot to put on my face today so I'm
going to try these out in unity tutorial
to you guys and we'll see how these go
but huge pans and just they look
absolutely glorious I picked up the
Jeffrey star and George Meade palette
and I'll show you guys about such a
dispersion your chocolate block I love
it this but it has such interesting
shades and it had like blues and greens
and purples so I personally bought this
because I really want to experiment with
a lot more color on my channel so I'm
really excited to try this out in a
video after we're done with the makeup
and the accessories and stuff I really
I did one top and then moved on to the
Mason just but let's switch over to the
clothes now this dress I'm so excited to
show you guys because you guys would
know that I am completely right or die
in love with my cha-cha tops but so I
picked up the cha-cha dress I love that
it came in a dress because I think you
know when I wore my tops with them
shorts it looked really cute but it
wasn't you couldn't really go out or you
know look fancy whereas this is a nice
fancy option that I can wear with a pair
of heels slick my hair back and wear my
choker I think this would look so pretty
with a red lip you know a rose in your
hair mmm that's a cool long sleeve top
this has roses down the sleeves it's
kind of midriff but not too much so it
shows your whole stomach and it's got
this really cool thing on the back wrap
on the back I love long sleeves and I
just think this with the roses on the
sleeves are really really cool and I
just kind of love this with denim jeans
or denim shorts and you know your
sneakers so next I got this little
winter dress it's this gorgeous gray
color is ribbed it's nice and stretchy
it's a turtleneck with the cutest little
frills at the top and it's long-sleeve
with the same frills on the bottom I got
this because I'm going into winter and I
just think that this would go so well
with any coat that I own nice and warm
and you should feel it's quite thick
fabric I think that this would look
really really nice with a pair of white
sneakers as well and you have slipped
back to wrapping a high like high messy
bun it would just look really cute I got
this again just for winter one of the
nice long-sleeve of the color of it I
love my neutrals but the main reason
that I picked this one up is I like the
platen so you can be really nice in
modest and wear your buttons all the way
up or you do me a bit sneaky and
unbutton a few and where you push up
round anyway you can do whatever style
you prefer
but I just liked that this has the
buttons that I could change up the look
of it I just think this color for
example goes so well with these jeans
and then if you guys can imagine some
white sneakers even a cap like we're a
little cute cap next again for winter
purposes I picked up these trackies have
worn these like three times now since I
got them I love them so the reason I
love these is because obviously they're
comfy baggy
Chucky's I love the lining down the legs
I've been wanting a pair of khakis that
were kind of wearable I also really love
Chaffey's like this with heels and then
like a little singlet and then finally
I'm going to be ending with the cute
little miniskirt over how cute is that
obviously I'm not going to be getting
much better anytime soon because it's a
little bit too cold for me to be wearing
a miniskirt unless it's a nice warm
winter day for us I hate that most
skirts are high waisted because
high-waisted skirts every time I walk
ride up and ends up going all the way at
my farm and they just everything I take
two steps in the top I talk about my mom
I love low waisted denim skirt I think
they're the cutest things ever it's just
a lot more flattering on me I get that
bulge out the front from the highways
yeah I love the color of it um yeah I
just thought it was the most perfect
little miniskirt ever and I had to get
it my name is cute little skirt with a
white t-shirt with these glasses yeah
that is the end of my whole I hope you
