just come back from the gym and I
walking to my door and I had a lot of
packages so today's intention was
actually gonna be a vlog but I've got so
many parcels that I think I'm gonna make
it a bit of a casual unboxing and just
show you guys some of the new stuff that
I've been ordering and that I've been
sent there's quite a lot of it so grab
yourself a snack that's probably gonna
take me a while I'm gonna take
everything out of the boxes now so I
don't have to just like sit here
unwrapping things and then I'll show you
guys what I got okay guys let's do this
I didn't realise I had done quite this
much damage no it's it's yes it's
shocking it's for someone like me that
has very very large fate I'm a size 11
foot I don't buy shoes that often and I
should I go to find shoes that fit so
because I'm going to New York this
Sunday I went on a bit of a shopping
spree I went on the iconic and princess
Polly and I got like 10 pairs of shoes
judgment aside world we're all friends
let's just yes first up from princess
Polly we have these sick boots I haven't
tried these on yet because I just want
to have a shower before I try these ones
on not my sweaty gym feet but um these
are everything I never have boots I
never wear boots might be not always too
big I just don't really look for them to
be honest but in me what I want to be
quite stylish secondly fruitfully I got
these cute little pink heels that tie
around the ankle Thiessen's I just
thought really cute I'm into baby Pink's
at the moment I like mixing baby pink
with red so I've got a few red items I
want to wear with the Pink's and I got
this pair which is a little bit more
nude just a nude version I like black
heels because I'm so tall I really
struggle walking in heels and so when a
heel is not too high and it has like
kind of a block to it I really like it
it's quite comfy for me princess Polly
again
despite sofa and these ones are super
cute as well just some little baby pink
mules which will be more casual for
during the day
should I take my glasses I say so then
moving on to the iconic I got some shoes
from the iconic and I spent a lot so I
got myself two pairs of sneakers a black
and a white self-explanatory I just
needed some new sneakers and I've never
had a black pair say they do probably
look really weird TV cuz I got some
little red heels they look bizarre
because the heel is really small but I
love wearing these pointy toe really
classic heels with ripped distressed
jeans and like a white t-shirt like a
super casual outfit with like a little
bit of a heel this just dresses it up a
little bit and maybe like a red lip as
well but um then I got these freaking
beautiful heels so comfy I did try these
ones on so comfortable like wearing a
sock with the heel and then I got kind
of like a black version of it alright
moving on from shoes I think you've had
a comfort that now we'll move on to some
clothes that I got from princess Polly I
got these freaking cute as hell cainy I
feel like I wanted to wear the bikini
top with a pair of like high-waisted
jeans and heels so we'll see the black
with the white is so cool it's gonna be
really flattering then I got this little
nude boob tube I just think this would
go with pretty much anything denim jeans
heels denim shorts then I got these
really cute denim shorts
I love Princess Polly's denim shorts I
just like it's kind of thin any shorts a
where they always seem to fit me really
well really nice and loose which is my
kind of jam everything this this
some red little miniskirt I love that
and so this was my idea the block red
with these types of heels and I'm not
sure what up maybe oh this top stop
yeah so yes I mean I got this top which
is really cool I'm gonna wear it like
off the shoulder sort of so we'll see
how I style it this with the Scott I
just showed you or maybe some denim
jeans and then I got this just because
it was super cute I just liked the knot
at the front then I love all of Princess
Polly's offend stuff Nicole I like this
singly I like that it's nice is low and
then I got a little black boob tube
which I think this will be too big as
well but this will just go with heaps of
stuff just right I just have in my
wardrobe and for one of the days I
really like wearing midi dress so
dresses that come down past the knee
with like ribbed fabric like this and
white sneakers and I got this super cute
belt this one is just plain gold buckle
circle the reason I love this is that I
can wear it around tight around my waist
to cinch something in like that red
dress or I can wear it around my hips to
hold in jeans and low low waisted things
which I struggle to find belts that do
both it's either waist or hips but this
one's really good because it has heaps
of holes then I got a pair of little
black pants just hight leather looking
pants but they're not leather at all
then I got my classic old midsummer
night star choker I don't know if you
guys remember I used to wear this all
the time and I lost it so I got this to
wear again and then I got a little gold
one that has little stars all over it so
if you saw in my last video I was
running like a little star one all the
way around my neck
that's kind of the same thing but it's
like a little bit more delicate it's not
so like above them I got a really high
waisted pair of denim jeans which is a
nice light wash which wearing this with
the nude crop so at the nude boob tube
and maybe some of the the pink heels or
like that would be quite a nice color
combination even like the red would be a
Oh God even the red would be a really
nice color combination and then the last
thing that I got from Vince is probably
which I thought would just be quite cool
and match a lot of my outfits was these
bad boys now obviously it looks terrible
with my gym hair no makeup and my gym
tank that makes me look like a boy but I
just think this would be really cool
with a lot of the outfits and the heels
by the way I will link everything down
in the description box I know I haven't
tried it on or anything but it'll all be
linked down there so if you want to find
any of this stuff it'll all be in order
of how I talked about it so from other
sites yeah I connect principally all of
it okay now onto all the makeup and
other stuff the other stuff that has
been sent from other brands so that was
I bought the iconic stuff principally
sent me that stuff so thank you for that
princess Polly Oh also they did give me
another code it is NY Sammy and that
will get you 20% are probably Belle
they've done in the description box
below and again that's one said just
love them it's their evening on to the
other stuff that I actually know I
bought this so I got myself a big bottle
of what is because I always carry these
ones around and I know that it's not
that good for you to carry these
constantly and use them all the time
because of the toxins and the chemicals
and blah blah blah but um I just wanted
to be better if I just had one standard
bottle of water and this is really good
because it's I think it's 2 liters yeah
it's 2 liters which is awesome because I
tried to drink at least 2 liters in a
day and so if I fill this up in the
morning and I just get it done I
I've leased up done - ladies and then I
can try a refill it and try drink more
and I chose blue what because I feel
like blue makes me thirsty next by
Charlotte send me a cute little bracelet
and it's that cute I think it's a lotus
lotus I have actually no idea I could
just be me if you do that up I know that
like delicate jewelry is like my
favorite thing and I know you guys
always ask why Charlotte is such a
beautiful delicate brand and a lot of
you always ask and I know I don't always
answer it just because it's a special
necklace that was given to me by Nikolas
but um Sarah and Sebastian is the other
brand that I pretty much wear all of so
Sarah and Sebastian and I don't have
much by Charlotte I've got one bracelet
that I you guys might notice it's one of
the gold bangles that I wear but by
Charlotte is really beautiful as well
next I got sent the Smashbox
Judy little matchbox studio skin shaping
foundation sticks so I think it has a
foundation and it bronzer on the end of
it which is cool I've got a huge
giveaway for you guys - thank you for
500,000 K okay I'm gonna put that in my
next vlog so stay tuned for a massive
giveaway and thank you guys so much
honestly means the world to me 500,000

but honestly blows my mind but um thank
you so much for supporting and
subscribing it really does mean so much
to me and I got all these new brushes
from Smashbox as well which Smashbox
brushes are amazing I went to an event
ages ago which I told you guys about and
we sort of were introduced to the new
clinic even better glow foundations so I
finally got my hands on the two shades
that are kind of my shades because
honestly when I used it the tester cuz
we got given testers oh I loved it which
are crazy the clinic pop lip shadow
which look so cool these are the colors
and I've got a few more so they're all
very berry toned lipsticks so then ki
has collaborated with tony bianco and
brought out two glasses i don't know
maybe they have more and I just got
these two since they're cool just like
definitely not my style
look but these ones are cool I like
these ones very like don't look at me
I'm famous the sort of black-haired
erasing charcoal people have sent me
their jewel solid charcoal wipes I got
some joe shampoo from Bumble and Bumble
some misguided perfume which is very
random but it's cool it's like you press
that button it comes out like a can
which actually makes me really thirsty
love this brand this friend is so
gorgeous this is salt and this is a
Mandarin oil which is a multi treatment
oil which you put in your bath and then
this one over this is red O'Malley this
is a body glow shining star argan oil so
it has heaps of shimmers and you shake
it up and it will come out with shimmers
in a week got it yeah that is gonna be
stunning look at that and then they've
given me a little sugar lip scrub and
then a sugar lip argan tint so like a
lip balm then I got these cute little
t-shirts from Olive and Frank which is
such a cool name so this one says girls
rule has what it says screw you II love
hearts on the boobs which is cool and
this one I'm super excited about because
nice foundations are like my favorite
foundations it's the ones I always come
back to so I'm very keen to try this out

their foundations I think so it's called
The Velvet Matte foundation stick and
