on this is the by Terry Baume De Rose
rut okay so as always you're just gonna
have to excuse my hair I suck at it we
know this by now you know this very very
well and truly right now I think um so
as you can tell by the title today's
video is gonna be my summary beachy
glowy makeup look yes I do videos like
this all the time but I don't do videos
using all these products like I suppose
I'm just mixing up my products and
showing you what I've been doing
recently this is kind of like what I
would do on like I mean I don't wear
makeup all the time to the beach but if
I wanted to look super glamorous and go
take photos at the beach or hump all day
and it's like still you know drinks with
friends and you still wanna have like a
little bit of makeup on your face this
is kind of what I would do and obviously
it makeup is makeup washes off you can
wear it whenever you want you do it
however you want but this is kind of
like my minimal beachy glowy
makeup look super natural but like
making you just look healthy and fresh
well that's okay I love face wipes and
the fact that this is coconut oil and it
makes me super excited because I feel
like it's just super gentle I like just
I don't know okay and then I got said
this the other day and I've just been
trying it out the last few days this is
the tarte drink of h2o hydrating boost
and it's kind of cool because it
literally looks like it's like gel water
so I just take it like a whole heap of
fat but weirdly like I get a bit drier
in summer but also Whaley so like I have
makeup on or like sunscreen on so it's a
weird combination in summer but I like
to make sure I keep it super hydrated so
that like it's not feeling the need to
get oily because that's what happens
when you get oily skin it's your skin is
producing oils to try and
moisturise itself if you are constantly
human your skin hydrated it won't feel
the need to produce as many oils now I
put this stuff back in their boxes just
to show you but I've been using this the
last week as well and I'm so excited to
show you I have two gift packs from
Sportsgirl so you guys know I'm an
absolute sports girlfiend they send me
all their products I have their
Christmas collections coming out right
now and I have a whole bunch of boxes in
the store where you can buy like packs
and stuff and it's for like the process
both and of course these ones spoke to
me the best in glow and the sculpting
glow like they're the ones I was like
yeah okay I'll have them use contour six
have been my freakin favorite thing ever
right now and this glow it's raw
you guys guys wait so you guys can see
it's in a package I can check that away
now ah I just wanted to keep that show
you guys so first I'm gonna use this
time to prime and it's a really
pearlescent finish and just makes your
skin glow like look at the reflected man
so I like to put that light on all the
high points of my face my god I look so
tired I need some concealer I go
straight in with my like creme bronzes
and I like a little bit of concealer
where is it
yeah I've briefly mentioned this in
another video this is the concealer that
way when I don't want to wear makeup so
like today if I've got like this
darkness and like redness under my eyes
this is what I wear and though it's the
weirdest thing it's a lip conceal assets
to like conceal your lipstick but it
doesn't crease under my eyes it stays
for so long it's so lightweight that's
so full coverage I only have to use the
tiniest amount it's so bizarre so that's
what it looks like I just take it on my
finger and I just kind of put it in all
the spots where I feel like I've just
got like a whole bunch of discoloration
just like the perfect skin color and
like I use the tiniest amount like
honestly like I just didn't use like a
teeny bit and look at that does that not
look crazy I look like a much more
awakened like light and bright look like
more dull on this side I was out of it
so this is been like an absolute
favorite of mine lately it's so random
because it's a lip concealer but I
looked all righty now onto this package
which has been wandering it but I use
the viewmaster it's all wet and too big
to do right here this package is called
the sculpting glow by one come to a
stick which has the dark shades and one
highlight stick which has the classic
like creamy white shade and in the
highlight shade which I used the
highlight shade this contour stick is
what I've been using every day so I just
draw that on my face II how pretty that
is it's such a nice bronzer shade it
Smashbox brush and just blend that out
I also love for some art their Coco
bronze which I think I've used in a
video the Coco bronze I'll use kind of
like my face my caramel Ebola to like do
anything I just mix a little bit with my
moisturizer sometimes but this is more
if I'm going for like the makeup no
makeup makeup makeup no makeup look this
color just works so perfectly with my
skin tone and so that's the darker side
and then on the other side this has like
a lighter shade and I'm using the medium
kit so there's also darker shades and
then there'd be a lighter kit as well
I'll show you guys how it looks it's
really pretty so I just like warming up
on the back of my finger and I just put
it like on my cheek right and so you can
see that glow better than the shake just
blends out like a dream because I want
to use this one this is the one we made
this like the other highlights good
enough but this one I'm just like oh so
I used to beauty but not insane oh my
god
usually I would just also use this on my
body like I don't think I'd need quite
this much whoa the little ass on this
side probably didn't need quite as much
he was right up with my finger first and
then go in that's better yeah good guy
this colors limited edition to this
Christmas package so you'd want to get
into it it's like iridescent one thing I
will say is you just got to be super
careful with the applicator because it
comes out with like a lot of products so
just it can get messy so just make sure
you like super careful when you put it
back in these I just wanted to show you
guys two highlights that I use that I
mean that like a powders that I you have
the much when I go out and in some of
these are the ones that I'm loving the
Lord elder guilt Laura Wow cannot speak
the Lord gala gilded honey is the most
perfect golden highlight and I've also
been loving it max
Global glow is like a little bit more
neutral a little bit harder to detect
but like as you move you can see it so
it's not like that really um bright
highlight it's like the one that melts
into the skin and as you move then it
shows up so it'll just kind of melt
everything in I'm gonna put it on my
forehead I've been loving this stuff and
I wear this all over my shoulders and my
collarbones and stuff as well okay so
I'm just hoping I might became you don't
wanna just cuz I wanna show you guys
like how crazy this stuff actually is
this is what I usually put on my body
because it is a little intense and I
just like to massage it into my
shoulders glowy and once you like
blended in it's not as see how you like
move and you can see it it's not like
too crazy but I'm gonna take a mixture
of two both my highlights the global
glow and the gilded honey and this will
set it down sort of stay in place like
all day and I'm also put this on like
the very high points of my shoulders I
don't massage it in as much and some
people like to put it like they're on
their boobs as well but I don't have
much in common so I don't like to draw
or do I just had to do it all so while
we're talking about the body I thought
I'd mentioned two products that I wear
are my legs so this is the senpai
finishing gloss isn't oil so I've got
the three of them that I kind of just go
between depending on where I'm going on
what I'm doing
this one is Frank body and it is the
magic shimmer oil so onto the rest of
the makeup the bronzes I love to use in
my summary looks is the napoleon paris
bronze patrol i like to use a shimmery
bronzer as well can you believe it are
we getting out of hand probably and so i
really like to just take this on like a
big fluffy brush and i just kind of put
it in all the spots that you guys i'm
sure know by now the other
of the face this is just a really
beautiful summery glowy one the blush
I've I love cream blushes I always have
all-time favorite cream blush for summer
is my clinic oil in where eyes glow and
another product that I love which is
marvel it stain is the Bene tint which
I'm like Burdick more something's it's
ugly hear me so I just it's a glitter
like a nail polish thing and I just
paint it onto my cheeks but it dries
pretty quickly so you gotta be quick and
blend that in weirdly I know this sounds
bad but I love some looking some but I
don't like getting sunburnt so like I
like to find anything I can that will
achieve that really healthy flushed look
without obvious they're getting some but
so I feel like this is one of those
products that just gives you that really
healthy summery flushed look and I like
draw it up as if that's like how I draw
it on my face now that goes up the nose
like up there like that so yeah the good
thing about this is a super buildable
and super liquidy doesn't leave too much
of like anything on the skin just blends
in really beautifully for brows I'll
just generally take a brow gel my DB
brows what I use in the shade number
three and I just brush all my brows
upwards and for lips I like to take the
Benetint again I like to put glasses on
but I like to make sure I have looked a
little bit of a tint underneath I
actually came across this and I was in
Saint Tropez and I'm really excited for
it to come out the Clarins lip stains
cuz it had a really pretty car that I
loved and then I put my claw so at the
top of it I just looked so so pretty and
I take my Clarins instant like natural
lip Perfector and I love this on another
great lip gloss that I find is perfect
that is the Fenty lip gloss I don't
always do this but if I want a little
bit extra definition to my eyes because
I've got like not many eyelash
extensions left I just like run like
lightly miss Cara there you guys have it
my summary golden glowing makeup look I
hope that you guys enjoyed it yes I'll
leave everything listed down below so
that you guys can pick any of it up and
hold that thought I totally forgot to do
the eyes which is important okay take
the bronzer again we run it through the
crease and then I take my Laura Gilda
Gilda Gilda I take it on up my little
pinky and I run that bad boy on my you
know tear ducts you guys probably made
this you probably would have done it a
little bit of brightness and dimension
and now I will leave you back to the
outro I love you guys so much thank you
for watching and I will see you next
time
