okay feel like I'm just gonna bust out
laughing every second I try this okay
I'm sick I'm not good at expressing
things you guys know this I feel like as
soon as the camera is turned on me I get
all good I don't know what to say I
don't know to do in this instance in
particular I literally don't know what
to say I don't what to do because this
is the most exciting announcement I've
ever made on my youtube channel I
designed my own clothing line
um I designed my own clothing line and I
decided to buying clothing line with
none other than princess Polly you guys
know that I wear their stuff pretty much
every single day of my life it's the one
place that I continuously shop at
because I know their quality and just
that style is always gonna be I just
couldn't think of a better person to do
this collaboration with I truly couldn't
because because I just really wear that
stuff every single day and and I'm sure
it comes as no surprise to you guys
because you guys know how much I love
them and how much I've loved them for
the longest time so where do I begin I
guess oh my gosh we started this
collaboration so long ago I will even
discussions for this collaboration we
started like a year and a bit ago that's
been in the works for the longest time
and working with the best team of people
and I'm so happy with how everything
turned out so the biggest thanks to Lee
Mel Sara Elise you guys Dream Team I
feel like we did it's such an amazing
job but you guys had to deal with this
diva leaves incredible and she would be
like you know I know that people don't
really like wearing brown and I was like
no I want Brown I want 10 I want beige
because I wanted to stay true to myself
and I wanted to give you something give
you guys a taste of my style and design
things that I actually genuinely want in
my wardrobe and that I want to wear and
I know so many of you guys are
constantly like oh
style along in style I just wanted to
give you guys a big taste of my style so
this video is a bit of an announcement
video I'm not gonna be doing a whole in
this video but I'm going to include a
behind-the-scenes vlog from my shoot and
you guys will see a snake pic of all the
clothes I want to give you guys a little
taste of what its gonna look like in the
tones and the colors and the shapes and
the fabrics that it's gonna be and then
when it does come to release I will I
will do a whole try on haul trying it
all on for you guys so you get to see
exactly how it looks literally fidgeting
I'm sitting on cross-legged sitting down
sitting on my knees sitting on my leg is
dead I just wanted I wanted to bring out
paces that super wearable super not
every day well yeah every everyday
pieces that I find anyone can add to
that collection and it will it would
become a staple as opposed to it being a
really out there piece I wanted things
that were classic and timeless and that
wouldn't go out of style colors are
again classic and timeless neutral soft
very luxe the fabrics are beautiful a
few of the jumpers for example have been
handmade didn't want to bring things out
that were really cheap and gross I
wanted to bring things out that were
good quality that would last forever
that you guys could keep forever all of
the pieces are really really comfortable
we went from size 6 to 16 so there's a
nice big range there's only limited
stock obviously so I don't know how far
it's gonna go I don't know whether it
will sell out oh man who wants it I
don't know so we're just gonna wait and
see it would be funny if literally not a
single person bought it
could you imagine that would be
traumatic so I feel like I've been
rambling on a lot about it I'm going to
go into more depth about my designs in
my next video when I try it on so I can
explain individually each piece and how
special each piece is to me the names
behind them the Styles the fabric every
single little detail you guys will want
to know will be in the next video but I
get guess I just wanted to come on here
and tell you guys about it and it is
launching next week I didn't want to
keep you guys waiting I just wanted to
tell you guys about it and then
not have you wait a whole month it's
launching and next week all the details
about it will be down in the description
box so check the description box below
but I do have a pre-sale link so if you
guys want to sign up to the pre-sale
link that will be down in the
description box as well so basically
what the pre-sale link is is that I want
to give all my loving subscribers or the
people that have supported me from day
one the chance to sign up to the sale
before the general public gets to shop
it so so if you guys sign up to the
pre-sale link which will be down below
you will be notified and have access to
this to the clothes before it's just
launched normally on to the site if that
makes sense
just sign up to the link regardless and
get all the information come on you know
you want to so until the actual launch
which is in a week ah have my launch
party which is on the 1st of June so you
guys can follow me on there so just
watch all the fun shenanigans that we
get up to that's just gonna be like
close friends and family and a few
people in the industry that will come
and I get really nervous thinking about
that but also like it'll be fun but I
don't like celebrating me it's gonna
make me feel awkward but I was saying to
lady she was like what do you want doing
a big party and I was like no I don't
have I have like three friends I think
two people will show up and that will be
my mom and dad so please can we not do
for fun mmm so yes that is all I am
going to tell you guys today I'm really
excited so I know I'm gonna keep
rambling on because all I want to do is
talk about it and explain everything to
you but instead I'm gonna show you guys
a little vlog from our shoot so I
decided to vlog the shoot and that will
literally just be little snippets you
guys we want to see the colors and tones
and a few at the outfits I just want to
show you guys a little taste of what its
gonna be like and then you guys will be
able to see the actual photos and things

Polly haul with my own clothes I love
you guys so much
enjoy the behind-the-scenes footage
enjoy
have my eyebrows tinted and I have a
treatment in my hair that's that
I'm getting ready to go to the airport
because I am launching something
something extremely exciting I'm
shooting something that I've been
working on for so long I am shooting
basically my designs oh by the way my
other camera still hasn't arrived I
wonder whether I bought it off like a
really dodgy website because I bought
that a while ago and it hasn't arrived
so I missed my flight but I got myself a
tumeric shot and an orange juice was
like carrot and ginger because I'm not
feeling well obviously I told you guys
and their coffee and I also 40 quarters
of the gold face just arrived in my room
and they've left me this oh my gosh red
wine chocolate malt Hayes's and some
skincare this is the beautiful big room
I can't even remember what this hotel is
called yeah I'm gonna wash my hair now
wash this treatment my hair how a shower
exfoliate my skin cuz this someone
coming over for a spray tan nurse and
I'm just gonna be literally eating all
these and sleeping because I'm so
exhausted still from our Las Vegas trip
to like it's kind of trick I was so
tired so I'm just gonna pass out I don't
because I am sick I am boiling myself a
how do I even be myself up a LEM sip
because that plane absolutely screwed me
like it was so freezing in the aircon
was so strong and I was just shivering
so I'm gonna have one of those
morning today is the day
it's probably like awake until I can
actually start telling people about it
now which is crazy I feel like I've
waited so long as soon as the final
designs were done and they were like now
I have to wait like a month or two for
everything to come through I was like
I'm just beyond excited for you guys to
get your hands on them I'm beyond
excited if you guys to see them hot
bleep the day is actually here don't
blink the day is actually here that I
get to shoot them like whoa what am I
gonna do or am I gonna pair with what

whole line so that you can mix and match
