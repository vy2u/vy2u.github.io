another Mecca package and this one few
to have heaps of nerve Urban Decay Aiko
keeps more urban design on the CRT and
some stuff from Kevyn Aucoin um I'm
feeling kind of speechless a little bit
overwhelmed as well if I'm being honest
yeah I'm speechless I don't really know
what to say I'm in a bit of shock I
think it's unusual that I've just had so
much stuff like obviously Max Factor
sort of collates all my stuff and puts
it together and sends it off to me in a
big bunch and just so happens to be that
I went to this before event yesterday I
got that massive package from Sephora I
obviously met the girls from another PR
agency today and they've given me a lot
of their shock it happens to me in the
last two days I have received probably
more products that I've ever received in
my entire life and I don't know how to
handle or what to say about it but I
guess I'm glad I was blogging and I
could show you guys what I got because
completely speechless this is the
aftermath of everything I've cleaned all
the rubbish and everything off the floor
and off my desk so that's nice and clean
but that just all needs sorting into
compartments that's all the rubbish and
then that's the stuff that I still need
I'm still yet to go through and then
also want to
putting giveaway piles and stuff you
will not believe what just came in the
mail or this from peg the loom
and this is obviously some filming of
Maybelline I'm doing a big campaign with
them so I need like lots of their makeup
to be able to film for them in their
channel but I just can't quite get over
the timing of all of this I'm in
complete and utter shock I am definitely
going to end the vlog here guys it's a
long one I know they don't want this
video to be taken negatively because I
am so aware of how lucky I am and I
don't want people to think that I'm
spoilt or what I am spoiled I'm very
very very spoiled but I want you guys to
know that if it's not being used by me
I'm giving it to a friend donating it
I'll be putting it in giveaways I'm
going to be putting it lots of places so
it's not just going to be sitting in a
drawer going through all my makeup I'm
going to start putting stuff on Dee pops
for my clothes so once my birthday is
over and I have more time and more
organization more time to organize I'm
going to be going through everything
finding a home for everything as well
and obviously I'm so grateful for these
brands who have sent Venus stuff it's
incredible and I'm not going to I'm
going to try out most of it because it's
my job to try it try it out and
recommend it to you guys if I love it
but if it's not being used I want to
give it away and give it a home so I'm
just want you guys to know how grateful
I am I do not want to come across as
spoilt or look like I don't appreciate
it because I really really do I
appreciate more than you ever know I
just yeah it's been enjoyed this happens
to be that the last two days I've
received small products and I think I've
ever seen in my entire life
anyway I hope you guys have enjoyed this
floorplan see how see in my next video
