me my 400k balloons and obviously it's
kind of all bunch different you got
really tell what that's so kind of them
thank you guys so much I didn't mention
in my last vlog my last vlog was kind of
long and I had just hit it but I thought
I would make a bigger asset to say thank
you guys so hitting 400k is literally
cannot believe it like 400,000 people
there's a big number 400,000 people was
like almost half a million people well
another night I have just come back from
the shops I thought I would show you
guys what I bought dad called me up this
morning after Pilates that's why I'm in
my gym gear and said that he wanted me
to come shopping and dad needed to get
some stuff from Tommy Hilfiger and he
said we should get some lunch so so I am
and then I thought in this vlog I would
include a what I in a day so I'm not
going to do it today he's already eaten
it could be like a health style vlog I
think feels relevant things I'm sitting
here in my gym gear I got this outfit
from style runner the girls that style
runner sent it to me which I'm very
lucky because I always wear like my
pajamas to the gym I don't have very
nice gym clothes so I feel very
profession miss out fit cool the pants
so this top is Nike B's and Marshall
weather friend buyer both of them are
from the style runner there is just so
much more to tell them to do exercise
and I've got a nice exercise gear hey
guys so it's a little bit later on in
the day I know religion look like it I
look like I just spoke to like I'm so
going to go but yeah just been doing a
bit of editing for a few hours I don't
know whether to talk about this subject
to you guys and I'm trying out this
thing called intermittent fasting which
is a very sensitive topic to talk well
because a lot of people have very strong
opinions when it comes to health and
that's completely okay everyone can have
their own opinions but I'm just trying
out something for myself so I am a big
big eater I weigh too much start eating
about eight so morning and I end
at about 11 p.m. at night the way that
I've tried trying to sort of stop the
overeating is I'm trying intermittent
fasting which I don't want any of you to
go try and use isn't fasting just
because I'm doing it I start eating at
around 12 and I end adding at 8 p.m. so
basically the the intermittent fasting
that I'm doing is eating for 8 hours and
then fasting for 16 hours so basically
you can look into it there's a lot of
great benefits from intermittent fasting
not weight loss necessarily but just
really good for your insulin levels it's
really good for diabetes I believe
lessons just have to gain diabetes look
there's a lot it there's a lot on it so
if you want to look it up you can go on
the internet there's a lot of facts
about it and I'm not going to say what's
right and wrong just trying it out so I
can shorten my eating time that way I
don't overeat and I don't binge so I'll
probably try it for a week or two see
how I go because if I eat in a smaller
amount of time within the eight hours it
means that I'm going to be eating the
right amount of calories and not
overeating so I'll be eating about 1100
calories in a day instead of 2006 series
I don't want to lose weight I don't want
to gain weight I want to maintain my
weight yes so I don't even know why I
told you this oh yeah so my first meal
today was at 12:30 with dad that was my
lunch I found that I've been drinking a
lot less water which is really random I
thought because I wouldn't be eating in
the morning that I would be spelling
what excited be hungry but I just
haven't been reaching for at all so I've
been super dehydrated and a good way for
me to take it my water intake is I love
drinking tea so I have lots cups of tea
a day and then also just keep a big
drink bottle next to me at all times my
manager is calling me I will be right
back
yeah yeah yeah I love them mm-hmm yeah
mm-hmm
yeah yeah that'd be fine okay perfect
sounds good
okay talk later bye where was I I just
am really nervous about incorporating
too much about fitness and health on my
channel just because I know it's such a
touchy subject and not only a touchy
subject was also a very opinionated
subject so people hold up very strong
opinions about it and you know what I
might think is right other other people
will think it's wrong and that's okay
like we're all humans or we all make
mistakes we all try different things I'm
just doing this for myself to see what
happens basically I just want to almost
train myself into having the right
amount of food and stop myself from
overeating and binging because I'm a
little bit of a binge eater and I know
probably a lot of you feel the same you
just overeat and you just don't really
know how to stop it because you know
your stomach is expanded to the amount
of food that you're making it used to
you guys probably know that I'm a
shocker I love hot chips I love Macker I
love chocolate I love cakes and cookies
and brownies and everything goes bad for
me I love I'm seriously one that
believes everything in moderation so I'm
not going to stop eating chocolate
altogether I'm not going to stop eating
hot chips because I love it like I will
I will have if I feel like it but I'm
just slowing down on all the junk food
and trying to incorporate a lot more
healthy salads proteins good fats good
carbohydrates instead of the really bad
ones which I found I was eating a lot of
be easy on me because I might get things
wrong
we're all human okay I showed you guys
oh I know I showed you guys this book in
my last haul if you watch my last vlog
won't last haul blog things this book is
amazing it tells you all the foods that
are amazing for your skin how much water
some recipes good exercise meditation
everything that's really good for your
skin and your inner beauty
I just really opened up an around of a
random page beautiful beauty food
essentials and it says apple cider
vinegar which I know cuz I watch a lot
of health youtubers berries flax seeds
hemp seeds chia seeds hydrating foods
like cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff
green powder like chlorophyll wheat
grass sprouts which I put in a morning
shot every morning organic whey powder
or any protein powder or any protein at
all really vegetables obviously water
lemon peppermint and coconut oil so
they're really good beauty food
essentials if you put those nutrients in
your body hopefully your skin will be
glowing and your inner beauty will be
shining so it will come you know through
for your skin through your energy it'll
just radiates I'd show you guys a little
mini haul of the things that I bought
today carry unexcited I got myself some
sports socks for when I go to the gym
and then I bought myself some new
runners oh how nice it is oh I've wanted
a white pair of runners for a while and
now that I'm exercising everyday I was
like go for it girl just get yourself a
nice pair of runners went into Calvin
Klein it's just so totally random I just
thought they were really cute some
little booty shorts so it's like a
little mini mini shorts with the cool
Calvin band around the waist oh hi I'm
just been to the gym now I'm lying on my
bed cuz I'm tired cute new shoes though
I'm going to make my first meal of today
which is my oath and I've showed you
guys this in my healthy morning routine
so I'm just going to have a cup of oats
and fill that with some water first so
I'm just using this friend it's just
organic oats in
and just no additives or anything which
is soon now I'm just going to cut one
whole banana to put on top
okay so now that the oats are done I'm
going to add in some protein this is a
super greens protein so this protein is
good because it's got pea protein and
proteins it also has wheat grass and
lots of nice green powders so it's kind
of like a two-in-one it's a nice
chocolaty flavor so it's going to add a
cacao chocolate taste to the porridge
and also adding in about the same amount
of castilian husk sur chia seeds that I
got from scoop pulses and just mix that
together now for a little bit more
flavor I like to add some cinnamon or
yummy I also add in some vanilla extract
but extra added sweetness I put in some
agave syrup my banana
I also like to add in some goji berries
I like to put a little bit more cinnamon
over the top my favorite part of the
whole thing at the peanut butter I love
peanut butter so I add quite a bit the
best combination ever and it's super
filling so that is meal one of today so
we're going to have the first refill of
water for the day so I've really drunk
one of these or almost I go between
putting two things in I've got this
papaya purple leaf extract syrup and
then I've also got my antioxidants in a
Beauty boost thing this is the one that
I was to first so I haven't had any of
it today from your core just like a
little bit in sort of like a teaspoon
tablespoon and it tastes really good and
then I have this one in my water
whenever I'm feeling bloated coz papaya
and pour pour are really good for your
digestion and help is blushing so yeah
they make drinking heaps of water really
easy drink to a bee Damon sometimes
train drink for you and they look first
snack I love my view to coconut protein
balls I don't think there's that great
for you like you don't have quite a few
ingredients it's got dark chocolate and
sugar and the general fat but it's also
got whey protein so timers dates
apricots shredded coconuts and cacao
powder so it's not that bad to you and
it's sort of a better alternative than
just eating dairy milk crunchy chocolate
okay so I've just jumped out of the
shower I'll just chop some comfy clothes
on I thought now I'd go make myself for
my second meal I'm just going to scrap
together whatever is in the fridge
whatever veggies are in the fridge and
some protein I'm gonna make a bit of a
salad I think so so it's got some lunch
so these are my ingredients I've just
got some avocado onion tomato and
capsicum to make the base of the salad
I'm going to put some spinach and some
rocket and then I'm also going to put up
a lawful in there and maybe some
shredded chicken so I'm going to put dis
falafel and the chicken in the microwave
first warm that up
put the salad together I think I'm also
going to add cashews we've just got some
cashews in a jar and I love putting nuts
in my salad tastes really good
this just keeps it fresh you and I love
cashews Cleo are you doing a month off
the table okay so I'm just going to save
bowls and just chuck it in there now
that it's been microwaved a handful of
spinach handful of rocket and I'm just
going to add all this into there I'm
just going to add a little bit of this
Japanese sushi dressing I love the taste
of this it's probably not that good for
me but it just makes it a little bit
more interesting there you have it
lunch is served oh it's not for you I do
regret not adding an egg onto it though
I love putting eggs and my salads it's
really random but I like poach it or
boil it and crush it up and put it in my
salad okay okay good boy but I'm sorry
I'm someone giving you any huh demolish
she's literally drooling oh there's
another one
ah ah ah such a pretty night sorry it's
kind of getting dark now the Sun is
setting outside but I thought I would
show you what I mean for another snack I
some palmas and some vitaweight okay so
I had every intention of making a sweet
potato who toast with avocado on it but
I felt lazy and I saw steak in the
fridge so I decided to make another
salad this time it has steak duck er
nuts caramelized onion and all the salad
ingredients and then I've refilled my
water bottle that is that I'm going to
just have some lint 70% cocoa dark
chocolate I always have like 4 pieces of
this but it's a lovely
and then just finish the night I will
most likely have a peppermint tea or a
lemon teeth and just hopefully finish
the rest of that water bottle so my
third bottle of the day yeah I really
hope that you guys have enjoyed this
video
let me know if you want me to do more
what I eat in a day videos in the future
and I will be sure to do that I'm sorry
that these one these meals weren't that
interesting it is Friday night and
everyone else is out and I just don't
feel like cooking I just want to say so
on the couch watching YouTube videos
Netflix oh I was being lazy but but I do
hope that you guys enjoyed it and yes
