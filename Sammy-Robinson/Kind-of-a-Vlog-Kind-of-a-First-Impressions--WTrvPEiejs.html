haven't been vlogging at all really this
past week I've just taken a little break
from vlogging because I've been super
busy but um I'm back I did take a little
bit of footage from my Christmas party
last night on my phone so it's not the
best quality but I think I'm going to
insert it anyway for you guys to see
we had a lovely dinner I've got lots of
leftovers so I'm definitely gonna go eat
some of that lunch so today I filmed
three videos I filmed two q A's and a
first impressions on this look and you
guys wouldn't believe it but I have
deleted the footage for the first
impressions I ran out of footage on my
SD card so I went through to delete some
stuff from old previous videos and I
deleted my first impressions I don't
know how or why I'm so angry at myself
because Here I am trying to pre-record
all these videos while I'm away and I
just deleted it oh so frustrating I'm
trying to pre-record because I'm going
to Melbourne in two days till the 28th
and then I'm back for a few days and
then I'm off to foster with Nick Phillip
for about seven days so all I have to do
now is I'm going to edit these two q and
A's because I have to upload them and
schedule them for the next two weeks
because I'm not going to have any Wi-Fi
that I know of for the next few weeks
but right now all I have to do is pack
for Melbourne because I will be out with
Nick all day tomorrow so I want to get
my packing done today I got my nails
freshly done this is an occult this is
an SNS color it's actually not a Polish
so I love that and I have to do my New
Year's look when I get back on the 28th
quickly upload that on the 28th of the
29th you guys I'm doing a collab with
Sally Joe I love love Sally she came to
Sydney the other week and came for
drinks at coogee for Chloe Murillo's
engagement party
I'm just an absolute mess right now I'm
a big stress ball because I have no idea
what video is going up when where I'm
gonna have connection
and what I'm gonna be able to upload for
you guys but I'm just I'm just hoping
it's all going to work out so it's like
I need to relax I'll be fine
I'm fine it'll all be good got these
dots all over me sunspots lord knows
what I've got all these packages that I
have to unpack and put away I've got all
these new products up here I finally
cleared this section and now it's
completely full of new products again I
also need to find some wrapping paper
because I'm going to have to wrap those
presents before I forget because I
actually completely forgot about that
yeah and okay I looked over the footage
and it seems that I got most of the skin
makeup in the video so I think what I'm
going to do is I'm going to include the
bits that I saved from my first
impressions video on this vlog so that
you guys can sort of see the first
impressions of the skin skin stuff I use
or whatever I use on my face so I'm now
going to switch the first impressions
part of the face and the makeup and the
bronzer and stuff so I hope you guys
enjoy and I will talk to you in a minute
Hey so I thought today I would do a full
face of first impressions as you guys
saw it in my vlog I got sent a lot of
new things yes I thought I would do a
little first impressions cute little
easy simple makeup look you guys always
ask me how I do my little button I
literally put it in the middle part
twist it around and that's it that is my
hair done it's like really nothing
special to doing my hair okay look I
know why I'm a bit of a mess today I
don't really know what I'm doing what
I'm striving for but I've got some spots
all over me but dirty hair but I just
wanted to sit down and film for you guys
so I'm going to start off with the
Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow instant
soft like soft focus beauty flash primer
looks a little bit like the Laura
Mercier radiance primer oh that's nice
it's so soft so I don't have any new
foundations that I haven't tried but I
do have this Coach end okay gendou
foundation I haven't really used too
much of so even though I was not a full
first impression it is sort of still in
the works for me I don't really know
what I think about it and it's got quite
medium to low coverage I'd say but um
yeah I don't know I try out
is it cosmetics heavenly luxe flawless
foundation brush it's probably going to
be dropping in and out the Lighting's
awful I can just tell them and I hate
what I look like in this video si si I
like this foundation but I mean it's not
my favorite as again I don't have a new
concealer so I'll just get this like
base part out of the way I'm just using
my Urban Decay all nighter concealer
same brush
oh this is a really nice brush for
concealer I look white as heck right now
so let's use some cream contour so a
brand that's going to be sort of first
impressions in general I've never
actually tried it I got sent a whole
bunch of Mira Nair's
this is the the tree contour V stick so
as you guys can see there's three
contour shades in there I'm just winding
up and I'm just going to draw this on
the contours of my face we what
that's really random I'm gonna zoom you
guys in I don't know if you can tell
what it's kind of like I mean it's
probably good for console this is quite
a gray toned but um let's try to blend
it out I'm going to try the Sportsgirl
contour stick in the shade contour hood
still pretty cool though
oh god please Oh me money please
everybody
oh this brush is amazing that's better
I quite like it I'm going to try the
mirror Ness Shawna invisible HD blotting
ping-pong smooth powder so it's just a
powder like this oh yeah
it's actually super pigmented for an HD
powder so I do I really like that do a
great job
Jenny genie I'm going to try their
cashmere powder it's a little bit light
for my face but that's okay I'll just
use it just to set the center portion of
my face and just like lightly dusted all
over my face
well the tiniest bit of that just fully
mattified my face I'm going to take this
go line terracotta draw blondes
number two bronzer it just looks like
that that's really warm toned so it's
definitely not a contour shade at face
that's really nice it's actually not too
pigmented and it's not as dark as a and
and red as I thought it would be you
know when you're adding bronzer to the
outer perimeter of your face you're
really just trying to warm it up and
like make it look quite sunkissed I feel
like this does an amazing job for
highlighter I'm going to go into this
sugar baby palette i swatched this in my
blog as well but I haven't used it I'm
going to take these two bottom shades
here so I'm just going to evenly dip
into both and let's see
I had used sugar baby faceless masks
before but I hadn't used makeup products
I didn't know they had makeup products
some shades as folks they're not too
light gives you like a nice range of
everything and then there's that really
nice bronzy shade as well I just take
this on a big fluffy brush and see if I
can just like bronze up my face with it
whoa yeah
oh my gosh I'm glowing so much right now
okay oh my gosh everything is such an
a-plus right now I'm obsessed with
everything
so now I have three edit three videos to
edit because I'm not going to make this
vlog on a weekly blog I'm just going to
make it up today so three videos to edit
I have one for next week two for the
following week and then I have to film
my new year's look so I think I'm gonna
have it two videos a week which makes me
very happy eggs thought I was going to
be super behind but it seems it'll be
okay Kat Von D liquid lipstick in bone
arrow yes what can I talk to you guys
about what has been going on so I don't
know if I told you but me and Nick are
going for a Christmas lunch tomorrow
he's taking me to Emily Wharf but I
don't know where we're going that's a
surprise I guessed I wasn't supposed to
know but I guess that's why he was
taking me but I don't know which
restaurant then Sunday morning Christmas
morning we are at we're in Sydney the
girls like opening their presents at
home because much fun a homely uh vibe
but then we get the plane at like 11:00
and then we get to Melbourne by
lunchtime where we'll meet all around
family and we're there to be a a we're
flying back to Sydney so that we can
have at New Year's in Sippy dance

relaxing he's got seven days off which
is awesome so we're just going to go to
Boston and chill um by the way I got my
dad some golf balls and a book so that's
what's with my dad it'll be amazing so I
already know what we were
Hey golf tennis we're going to go
fishing we're going to go paddleboarding
we're going to go to Mexican tappers a
nice cafe and then just relax some base
dress at a time because that's what
posture is good for just relaxing nice

so I've got my mum a diffuser I also got
her a little water a glass bars for her
to put her watering to serve at like
dinner parties so you can put like lime

little tap and then I got her a little
fresh moisturizer so I love the brand
fresh that'd be nice
called youth preserving and she loves
stuff like that so that's my mum what
else will be going on
so I'm going to assume that this blog
will be up before I do the cute snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A I'll put them up sometime in the
first week of January my vlog in foster

really like being on camera
I love what I can but otherwise I might

thing I hope you guys have an amazing
New Year's and Christmas though wherever
you are in the world I have it's filled
with joy and family and incredible time
with whoever you're with or even if
you're alone just relaxing the holidays
is such a nice time it's so funny
everyone always asks me Oh does it suck
having you know you hold your Christmas
holidays in summer but I mean it's all
obviously all over than own so I can't
say it sucks because I wouldn't know
what it's like to have a winter
Christmas does it pretty beautiful up
there with all of you with your snow and
your lights and the cold weather but I
mean Christmas to me has always been
summer and going to the beach and having
cocktails and hanging with family around
the pool I think it's just like it's
amazing no matter what holidays and
Christmas especially I'm a big fan of
Christmas
okay so I'm just wrapping the mums last
doesn't know then I just need to pack my
suitcase but I think I'm going to
procrastinate I'm just going to add us
