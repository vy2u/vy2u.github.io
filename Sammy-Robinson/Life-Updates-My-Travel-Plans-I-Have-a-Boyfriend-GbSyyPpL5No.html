I thought I would just sit down in my
room today and film a sort of life
updates video just so that I can update
you guys on a few things that are about
to happen in my life and a few things
that have been happening and just talk
to you guys a little bit because I've
been out of action a little bit lately
on YouTube and I thought I would just
sit down and have a chat so first things
first I guess we'll talk about my
travels because I guess that's the
biggest thing that's about to go on in
my life I'm going away with through my
best friends and you guys if you've
watched me for ages would know that it's
Laura Daisy and Holly so I'm going away
with them for about just over two months
so I'll read to you guys the list of
some of the places that were going um so
we're going to ask them then Berlin
Prague Rome Florence Cinque Terre nice
lauterbrunnen I don't I don't know how
to pronounce it
lauterbrunnen um that's just like a
little village in the Swiss Alps
which'll - absolutely beautiful guys
like all these cute little cottages and
there's like waterfalls and things like
that just um and then we're going to
Barcelona and then I better split so and
then in split we're doing the sail
Croatia and we're doing that um at the
beginning of July which is my birthday
so if the fifth of July is my birthday
and yet we'll be on sale Croatia for
that one so I'm super excited for that
and and then we're going possibly just a
dodge to do ultra festival and then
we're going to go to Budapest for a bit
and then from there we're going to fly
into Athens in Greece and we're gonna do
like make it awesome
and a few places said we're going to
stay in Greece for about two weeks and
then um from there I'm actually going to
fly into la la and stay there for about
a week and I'm just going to sort of be
on a bit of a business trip then so I'll
be leaving Europe and the girls will fly
home and yet I'll stay in LA for a
little bit and sort of meet my managers
over there and yeah get a bit of
business done hopefully then that'll be
around August around August 10th that
I'll come home so we're doing just over
two months of traveling and yeah but if
you guys have any suggestions of things
we should do while we're over there if
any of you live in those places that I
just listed or have been there before
and done really amazing things a lot of
you guys could write that in the
comments below because we still are yet
to do lots of research into each place
that we're going so that we know what we
want to do while we're there and we
don't just leave it to the last minute
and get there and just have no idea what
to do you know so um I would love it if
you guys could leave any suggestions
that would be so helpful for us but on
the topic of traveling um I just bought
myself a new blogging camera so I bought
myself the Canon a7x I believe and that
should be arriving within the next few
days
um so I'm going to try and get a little
bit of vlogging under my belt before I
go to Europe just to get a little bit
more practice in um so yeah hopefully
there'll be a few more bugs coming up on
my channel too
but yeah the main reason I got this new
camera is so that while I'm overseas in
Europe I can keep vlogging and I can
sure that I'm uploading videos
relatively frequently because I won't
know the internet connection I'll have
and I won't know in which ourselves and
things I can upload so I won't be able
to say it's going to be frequent but
while I'm over there I'm hoping that
I'll get enough connection in certain
places that I can upload vlogs to you
guys so that you can sort of see what
we're doing and keep up to date with my
Charles excited to do that I'm excited
to start vlogging and show you guys a
little bit more of me and a little bit
more personal things I guess on my
channel so you'll be able to follow me
and my friend me and my best friends
around Europe and yeah just I'm just so
excited I don't know I hope it'll be
good see ya the main general gist of
this video was mainly to update you guys
on my travels but then I do have a
little a few more life update to give
you Xavier is coming over in a few days
on she's coming over on Thursday so we
want to film I could get ready with us
and so you guys can just chit chat with
us um cuz we get quite a few requests
from you guys asking us to film when
we're together so let me know what you
guys like to see me and car near the
film will probably be just I could get
ready with us or if you guys want to see
us do a challenge last
um so another update I guess is that I
do have a boyfriend now his name is Nick
so yeah I have a new man in my life um
it's gonna start when I go away
something for two months and he isn't
coming with me but it'd be fine yeah I
thought I'd share that information with
you guys just so that you're up to date
with my love life um yeah so you guys
probably have seen lots of photos of him
appearing on my Instagram and he's
constantly on my snapchat um so if you
guys want to follow me on snapchat
Instagram I'll leave all of my links in
details down below but if I can
eventually convince him to come into a
video I will um oh he is that
comfortable doing it but um he'll
definitely appear in blogs and things
that are coming up so I'm just gonna try
film lots more things they say so you'll
see you'll see more of him I can't go
into if you're coming videos but just
he'll be on my snapchat and Instagram
things if you guys curious
so yeah that's fat fat it's probably the
last most random life update I have for
you guys is I'm getting my wisdom teeth
taken out on the 29th I'm probably going
to have a worse recovery than most
because in an x-ray that we took this
wisdom teeth goes straight upwards with
this one grows completely horizontally
so they're gonna have to do a little bit
more digging to get that one out
apparently so I'll be out for two weeks
which sucks because then two weeks later
I'll be leaving for Europe so I feel
like I've so many things to do and not
enough time so if I am lacking on videos
again around the 29th to a sort of
13th of May that is why because I will
have a face that is like a chipmunk and
I don't know film I'm looking like a
chubby little children chipmunk unless
you guys would find that funny and you
want me a video like the day after my
operation where my face is like swollen
out here I can not promise that I'll do
that because I'll probably be in a lot
of physical pain but like I guess that
could be funny I've written down a list
of things that I want to film so I have
a blog coming up where I have I have so
many jobs coming up that I have to do
before I go away like go to Telstra and
change my plan I'm going to bank because
I started a business so to do lots of
banking by memory cards and charges and
take you guys as part of like my travel
essentials and things traveling and
vlogs and what lifestyle things that I'm
about to embark on I thought I would
start vlogging in Sydney as well and
sort of take you guys with me to see
what I buy what how I plan my trip and
what I'm going to take with me so I'm
going to do that they like lots of logs
like that coming out just so that you
guys can come along with me and plan my
trip with me before we go and then you
can be on my trip with me when you watch
my vlogs you know what other life do I
have
probably should've written down a list
before I started filming this cuz I know
that I'm going to finish this video and
then I'm going to remember that I have
so much more to tell you guys that's all
right though I can just do like and get
ready with me do it we're doing I'll go
get rid of new cardio I can just talk
about things that are going on in our
life so hopefully there's nothing else
to tell you guys can you believe I have
a boyfriend so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video and you've sort of
felt up to date in my life I guess
because I have been a little out of
action lately um you can expect to see
two videos from me this week I'm going
to upload this one and then also I'm
doing video with Maybelline and I'm
doing like sort of like an updated
eyebrow routine I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you in my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
