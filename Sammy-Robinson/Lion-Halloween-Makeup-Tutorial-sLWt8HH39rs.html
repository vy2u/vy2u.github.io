you so much for watching so today I'm
doing the lion look that I posted on my
Instagram so a few days ago I went to
sort of a Halloween party and I just
supposed a lion
I've already started off by putting a
base around my eyes just used the mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 30 because
that works isn't good eye base for me
that counts what counts is that any of
the redness on my eyes so now I'm just
gonna set that with my AC on torque it
just the sort of light pink shade here
I'm just going to set my eye base with
that so now we're gonna go in with some
sticky tape I'm just gonna take two
strips of that and what I do is I just
put it against the back of my hand just
to get rid of any of the excess excess
excess stickiness just so that it's not
too rough around the eyes and then I
line it up from my bottom lash line to
the end of my eyebrow looks so good cool
so once you have put your sticky tape on
I'm going to go into my Z palette you
can take any palette that has sort of
neutral brown shades and I'm going to
start off with creme brulee that's just
a really light soft brown shade and
we're just going to take that product
and run it all through my crease and
then I'm gonna really bright in here as
well so bring it into sort of this
hollow section just here
so now that we have our transition shade
down I'm gonna go in with a shade that's
a little bit darker it's prepared my
makeup geek and I'm gonna go in with my
Jessup blending brush and I'm gonna run
that through exactly the same spots just
deepening up the crease area over than
even a smaller brush again and going in
with the zoeva luxe crease brush and
mock up by makeup geek it's just a dark
brown I'm gonna run this shade more
precisely in the socket and again
bringing it into this you know place
and I'm really gonna build up the
darkness just in this outer corner here
so now I'm going to go in with my
Maybelline eye studio gel eyeliner in
blackest black and I'll use my Sigma
angled brow a 75 brush so now for lashes
I'm gonna go in with the house of lashes
in the style ikonics I'm gonna get onto
the rest of the face I'm gonna start off
with my Too Faced hangover primer and
I'm just going to put a few pumps over
my face take my NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation in the shade Tahoe
and I'm gonna run a light layer all over
my face now taking my zoeva silk
finishing brush I'm just going to buff
that into my skin
now I'm taking my naked skin concealer
by urban decay in the shade of light
warm and I'm gonna highlight certain
spots of my face so I'm highlighting the
section of my face to bring forward my
cheekbones sorry the tops of my
cheekbones I'm going to highlight down
the center of my nose quite widely
because they have quite a wide set nose
and I'm gonna highlight these two points
of my forehead and then most importantly
I'm going to highlight this part of my
upper lip
and then you're good to go so I'm just
taking a Beautyblender and I'm going to
blend that into my skin
so now I'm going to go in with my
coverfx come to a kit in the shaved ink
and I'm gonna go in with number three
and I'm going to carve out my cheekbones
round out this section
you want this part of your face to
really come forward so we're hollowing
out underneath it and you want to just
draw that down the center of your
forehead and then around the sides just
next to the bits you highlighted this
will just bring out the highlighted
spots
take some translucent powder and just
set everything you've just done
now I'm going to take my Sigma tapered
kabuki brush and my AC on tour contour
and highlighting it and I'm going to go
back into that creamy sort of shade and
I'm going to set all the highlighted
spots
so now I'm gonna go in oh no I'm not so
now I'm gonna go in with my Bahama Mama
bronzer by the balm and this models
prefer airbrush foundation brush but I
use it as a contouring brush and I'm
going to set all the dark spots again
remembering to round out new contour
around your forehead also gonna contour
the sides of our nose but you're quite
widely because cats have that wide nose
so not slimming down our nose we're just
contouring around it and then connect it
to that eye shadow that you put into
that inner corner so now I'm gonna go
into my Coastal Scents so3 brush and the
same bronzer the Bahama Mama bronzer and
we start here at the bottom of my nose
if you sort of smile you can see the
shape of that section of your face we're
going to contour that so just pull a
funny face so that you can see those
lines there and you're going to contour
it
take some cream / white eyeshadow and
I'm just gonna do that all right in the
center of your upper lip you want that
chain to be matte though so don't go
anything shimmery so now I'm going to go
back into a mocker by makeup geek and
I'm gonna take my luxe pencil brush by
zoeva and I'm gonna go back into my
lower lash line now so I'm just gonna
start at the outer corner and just
deepen up my lower lash line and just
slick it
so then when you get into this inner
corner we're going to drag it across but
so you're going to just take it a little
bit downwards if you can see what I'm
doing so like you're not connecting it
to your tear duct you're just bringing
it downwards
so now go back into your gel liner and
we're going to extend this part and now
we're going to go back in with our gel
and we're going to draw a line directly
down at the center of our sort of
Cupid's bow and then we want to line our
top lip
and then take the liquid line up this
portion of your nose
and around your nostrils so I've created
just a V and then you're just gonna
connect it down so now I'm going to take
the Sigma eyeliner
io5 brush and the same liquid so it's
coming liquid gel liner and I'm just
gonna dot three dots on either side of
my lip
the brush I'm gonna fill in my top lip
final step is to take a setting spray
because you want this to stay in place
all night and just say let's take your
face so I'm using the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray so that's the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed it
