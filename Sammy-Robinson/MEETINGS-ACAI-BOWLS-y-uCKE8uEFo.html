I have about 20 minutes to kill now just
charging at my phone and laptop because
I realized it didn't try to last night I
accidentally unplugged my adapter I'm
heading into the city to have a meeting
with my lawyer
nothing scary doriano a lawyer sounds
scary it's just having a meeting talking
through a few contacts and then this
afternoon katya is coming over yeah
she's going to film a few videos from
Maybelline she hasn't set off her
Maybelline studio so she's going to come
use mine so it's Friday today I've been
to the gym this morning that's why I
love a sweaty mess but I kind of I don't
have time to shower before I go into the
city so I'm just going to rock this rock
the gym looks and then I'll come home
have a big shower and probably fake tan
and stuff for the weekend
I like carpet and I've got lasers
tomorrow morning tomorrow morning will
be obviously Saturday and so I have a
meeting about my 21st we're going to go
through sort of the decorations and the
decor that I want at my 21st is going to
be all white and then with pastels like
baby pink baby blues and stuff organized
like catering and bar staff and staff
it's just going to be a lunch so there's
only like 20 of us but I want it to be
like a really nice lunch because that's
my favorite thing to do have cocktails
and lunches my friends and I've got
plenty more money and then I've got
laser need to wash my hair today though
this is not okay for the rest of the day
I I want to film with you Maybelline
videos as well today but I still haven't
received the next round of products I've
gotta wait for that to come and then I
can start filming lots more for them
otherwise I've just got a whole bunch of
editing to do so princess Polly which is
growing up on Sunday I made another
order of princess Polly stuff last night
so I'll probably include that in a blog
I won't do two holes in a row that ll do
a little unboxing next vlog for you guys
when that arrives it could have been
been this flow actually tomorrow night
if it's not raining Nick and I would
like to go see vivid in the city to the
light show in Sydney but I think it's
apparently forecasted to be raining so
that might not happen and then another
option is that we have a little event
with moet at Fuji pavilion and L the
magazine is hosting that I'm not going
to lie I'm slightly hungover this
morning because it was Jessica's 18th
yesterday and where they were to beYOU
know she had a very chilled one but I
did
killer shots with her mmm I'm not
feeling so fresh or some sort of killing
time talking to you guys while I'm
waiting for my stuff to charge and then
I'm gonna head off into the city don't
think I'll bring my blog and camera
though just because obviously I can't
feel my meeting with a lawyer because
it's highly confidential
not really but yes I probably catch up
with you guys when cardio's over later
you know she is how everyone I'm sure
you missed me after I know I just come
over here to steal her that job she does
I only don't see me so I just had a
shower and I'm I mean my comfy clothes
as well just for the feel feeling really
fresh but feeling quite sick I've got a
massive headache so I'm going to go to
bed really early tonight
yeah I had a tumor juice today am i
meeting and I feel like it like her if I
bring out my segment well yeah yeah well
I had a turmeric and lemon juice at my
meeting um so yeah tonight I'm just
going to be editing and I'm gonna go to
sleep got an early start tomorrow for my
other meeting but yeah but I just shake
ass car do you have see her in a while
and you asked after her if you guys will
fill holes do a club when I get back
yeah will do so like can you guys like
tell us what you want to see those a
semi nice suck I hung out with ideas to
go missing because we go to do it and
we're like well I don't coming have
anything like there's no I can't think
of a single thing to know let us know
all right cut catch you on the flipside
oh my god what oh why should we don't
know yeah that was like really intense I
was really Wow okay so I can already
tell that this vlog is going to be a
such a random gamble I know that I
picked up my camera really randomly
really sporadically and it's probably
not making sense at this point this fall
and I can just tell is going to be just
all over the place really random you're
going to be like wise what's the point
of that it's like what am i watching yes
and then that's what happens so random
buys that ate like a penis of yoga and I
feel quite sick I very rarely eat dairy
and it's sitting a Massiah guy just does
not feel very good so I had my meeting
this morning you know when you have
those meetings that just really inspire
you and they're like yes goal I social
as well
this could have been quite interesting
but when it got my fools license so I've
been on my green peas but way longer
than I'm supposed to be well for a year
longer than I was supposed to be and
today when and finally got my fool's
license which means that there's no
provision so I got that done got my car
reg oh and everything it completed which
feels good so my car has insurance reg
oh everything is done for the year all
my contracts sorted out my car into
service so everything is working at a
treat not going to break down in the
middle of nowhere I've got all my pilot
planning under way so that's exciting
too I'm very excited my 21st can be a
good time and then I'll probably go for
dinner on the Wednesday I'm actual
birthday at mr. Wong's which love this
one I haven't been exercising very much
because I've been very busy but I'm keen
to get back into the gym tomorrow and my
morning routine will be up so that
willow
I will afford it uploaded that you guys
will already seen it if you haven't I'll
link it down below for you guys to see
and that involves a little bit on my
pilates that I do well gorgeous night it
is outside look at that Sun setting
absolutely stunning that palm tree
shadow that's a nice night so this is my
favorite purchase from my new order you
guys are probably I'm a crazy obsessed
woman for how many glasses have been
awesome recently these are also kind of
like a copy a copy of the ray-bans
different shape so again everything will
be linked down below so if you guys want
to have a look at this it'll be in this
description box good morning lovely
people it is Thursday morning I just
went and grabbed myself a coffee and I
thought I would show you this shirt this
is another shirt that I got from
princess Polly in my last little order I
always go on when they release like new
items and I just just buy I'd buy it
with my own code anyway yes I thought I
would just say good morning I'm doing a
little bit of online shopping at the
moment over there as you can see because
my birthday is in about 15 days maybe
more maybe like 16 15 days my 21st and I
don't have an hour
I just want to get an idea maybe have a
look of mine see what's around and then
I might just go shopping and then in
about 35 minutes I'm going to be leaving
for my event which is a lunch with mood
by nature and picking Steph Bailey up on
the way and then meeting Ronnie there
Ronnie's staying over tonight but I'm
actually going to a show called kinky
boots in the city and I want to film
another makeup tutorial soon I hadn't
done the makeup tutorial since my
mermaid one which was more just kind of
like a trying out holographic makeup but
I want to do something cool maybe with
my new jeffree star palette if you have
on that early next week I've subscribed
like 50 new health channels I used to
watch just makeup only makeup and now I
actually very very rarely watch makeup
and I watch mainly health channels which
I love I also got this yummy little
bucket of veggies but I can eat later
because I've got my you foods they're
not that feeling they're not feeling
enough for me so I thought I would buy
just a bunch of veggies to put with it
okay so this is my outfit I've gone for
a white long-sleeved top with like some
cool flurry sleeves these cute little
stripy shorts and some clogs it from far
away yes and there's my Gucci bag
that's the outfit I've gone to the side
part slick something a little bit
different um I'm going to leave now that
I can get stuff and I will see you guys
that so we've arrived to Rosie picked a
little Stephanie up and we're going to
go to Catalina the restaurant for some
lunch look you I have named behind the
scenes is working
I'm gonna come for me also what pretty
drawer ladies I'm gonna hide with a
jewel ladies I got myself a glass of
champagne nothing hi guys oh yeah
none Oh she'll be dead the really spoke
to them she'll always get this going to
work
 but at least were all so beautiful
I staying for
we just woke up so we're looking a
little bit worse we'll head back I know
I forgot to bring my camera last night -
kinky boots which is so annoying because
it was amazing and I just
yeah I'm terrible at vlogging this log
has been so bad but I cut my camera was
in my car so I thought pick it up this
morning and we're gonna go get some
brekkie then I've got Jim at 10:30
we've got Ronnie here so I've got my
hair specialist I like my favorite
snacks at the moment have definitely
been strawberries with yogurt and some
passion fruit oh so yummy I don't know
who you are it would appear you know me
it's pretty clear that there must be
something that you need you're giving me
anxiety I need a little privacy
why do you follow me around you wanna
dance
so I have a place to hide stay away from
my house
I don't know what to do with myself
against them forever locked inside this
house away from the darkest and burning
Sun to make you wonder if I'm the real
crazy oh we have a bit of a sweat after
that one I'll show you guys a little bit
of skipping that I do Jordan who's my
trainer before every boxing session we
warm up with skipping so this morning at
boxing it was simple I was learning
kickboxing so we were just practicing
and he holds he holds his arms like this
and holds like two big bags I kick in
two and we're just practicing practicing
going through it he was like okay now
step back take a step forward and like
kick it like I took a step back and like
kicked the hardest guy course and I
completely missed the bag he was holding
and I kicked directly into his elbow and
it got me like just here on my foot
oh my god I've been like really
struggling to walk all day and I'm
trying to keep moving keep my ankle
moving and like do some skipping and
stuff just as I doesn't see that because
every time I sit self really well
it gets so sore I don't know if that's
what I should be doing I probably should
be sitting down and icing it but I know
it'll just create a bit of a bruise it
won't be that big of a deal but it was
painful anyway it's about two o'clock
now I've just been editing and doing a
bit more online shopping trying to find
help for my birthday and then tonight is
the AFL week and I had planned to go but
I'm not sure if we're still going to go
or if we're going to go for dinner
instead so but um yes I will you know
forever I got myself and a sable with
banana strawberry peanut butter mousse
Lee and obviously acai mixed with banana
and a kombucha just just the original
flavor it is such a beautiful day today
yay so I got myself one of these gorilla
pods that everyone uses for their stand
meal prep stuff and so I can put up in
my car and things get better shots
so yeah the actual obsession strip
I added some goji berries mmm smothered
in peanut butter Wow well I want to
apologize for how completely random this
vlog is but yeah I guess I've just sat
here and finished editing it and I've
come on here to end the vlog yes not
much happened I want to try it upload on
Sunday mornings now just to see what the
difference is I personally don't really
ever notice a difference in uploading
schedules it always ends out being
roughly similar numbers anyway and it
just depends on what people want to
watch to be honest but I'm going to try
to do Sunday morning so I want to get
this edited by tonight promising my next
vlog I will try and do something a
little bit more interesting I definitely
want to incorporate more what I eat in a
day so I know I showed you guys a few
acai bowls and that's not what I made so
I want to make I want to start making
more food and showing you guys what I
eat and also really randomly this vlog
is actually from like two weeks so when
I started filming with my meeting that
was last week and when cardia came over
that was so long ago and then I sort of
ended it with this week as well so if
you guys are confused in the timeline of
this I am confused as well look at it
started filming last week and then have
continued it this week so yeah it's
really really random computing jumble of
events but um I will get on a better
role next week I promise I'm also aware
I didn't show you guys the print thrust
of the princess Polly stuff that I got
I'm going to show you in next blog
otherwise this looks going to be way too
long and yes I just want to I just want
to make sure that I do my makeup and
feel pretty and then I can show you guys
some of the stuff that I got
so yeah I will talk to you guys later no
no show me
but you'll always get the sky the worst
yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
