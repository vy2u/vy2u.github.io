video and I'm in my new house I thought
I would just preface this video because
I actually realized that I haven't
filmed an introduction for it so what
you're about to see is the process of a
messy messy girl that owns way too many
things boxing up her house and anything
and I'm gonna do a house tour soon
probably I just don't want to do it too
soon because there are crazy people out
on the internet that try to find where
you live and that's just not cool and
for privacy reasons I'm gonna wait a
little bit to do a house tour but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video you guys
gonna be shook by how much stuff I own
it's honestly I also film an outro so
this is like future of me talking to you
and then it'll come it'll swing
background and and with this as well I
hope that you enjoy the video and just
keep on watching so today it's gonna be
a long day this is what we're dealing
with send us a prayer we haven't even
sent any of the boxes yet so we've kind
of just tried to quit stuff or the place
full of cushions then you come in here
and this is the other thing that I'm
dealing with great-great-great
great-great-great-great Gretch so I'm
currently calling it the remai lists
except booked a whole bunch of boxes
that's 12 they have a common
we really need the boxes to quit the
highway
so for makeup we're just taping these
stuff in and hoping it's just gonna stay
it put and for this drawer I've just
stuffed so much stuff in it like all my
brushes I've just put in with my
eyeshadows and all these lipsticks oh my
god here's all my food I'm currently
just doing all my washing stuff I've
chucked so much old food out put all
this away suitcase I love clothes
but a few other boxes rubbish my chair
or my candles got to attack this section
here which was originally my giveaway
box and now it's just I have no idea
what's up here aside from a few things
that is done there's a pile for friends
and family for Christmas they can come
and take whatever they like and this is
the pile that I kept from it that I will
either be keeping for me or for
giveaways for you guys what are you
doing what are you doing there's my girl
can I see that little face can I see
that little face hey we've been working
for us like four hours and it literally
feels like nothing has happened this is
honestly gonna take us probably forever
I think it's a never-ending job but
it'll be oh so worth it and then kind of
when you get that you gotta unpack it
all that's the thing that actually sucks
so the boxes have arrived and we've
started loading some stuff up I don't
think it's legal to have as many
belongings as I have it's a bit crazy
like I didn't realize actually like the
extent of how much stuff I owned because
it shouldn't it's not it shouldn't be
allowed it's embarrassing it's
completely embarrassing I've done a lot
of my clothes so they're all gone
exciting um and I've got so much stuff
to give away like I can't even I've got
tubs and tubs and tubs and tubs of tub
got my main man helping me out today
she's having the time of her life she's
like what is going on BAM Bam's fluffy
you having fun hey there's a good boy
what's keys doing that man yeah Oh big
stretch feels oh we're getting that I'll
show you guys a little update this is my
desk which I'm taking I've just strapped
up my makeup drawers all my charges I'll
just bring myself the bed we'll go in
the car the shelves and so these are all
sort of like toilet trees and kitchen
stuff and chairs that I'll be taking
this is all gifts for my family and
friends so I'll let everyone come over
and just pick what they want and then
this is how we've gone so far all these
boxes feeling good obviously it still
looks a mess worse just because I've got
pretty much just rubbish everywhere I've
just been taking all the rubbish off but
yeah feeling tired Henry's tired John
Henry's tired been a long day little
Henry last morning in the flat all these
boxes are about to be picked up Wow Oh
yawn how do I had it it's Friday by the
way sign my legs get my keys
Kate who is filming right now I was let
there Ava listen showing them what to
pack I've driven home sort of helped
them put all the stuff in the car and
now I've managed to make myself a little
sleepover bag with all my stuff as well
and we're driving back the removalists
are following us but they're so slow and
they're gonna lose me and I'm just gonna
pull over so they can see me like oh god
I just gave them the address and they're
like we'll follow you but I'm like can
you just get they selves I want to be
able to so yes sweating and I can't wait
to have a shower my god got very excited
that I got home and like jumped up on me
and she's a big heavy dogs like when she
jumped something it's like okay where's
when Henry jumps up it's like a little
never touching you relax now me and
Katie gonna go get some lunch have a
look at my place around my food money
money what's called money pad and then
we make a look at my brother's new place
cuz Dan our brothers just moved out as
well we've moved in so we are just
waiting for the removalists to bring
this stuff in and we've just ordered
fish ball so we have a little lunch on
the terrace outside and then probably go
get a coffee at the local I do a proper
house to one side but I'm gonna eat
outside I'm not a John Doe breathe has a
ride yeah this is what we're dealing
with right now everything's sort of been
putting this room and this is gonna be
my office
it's my little bedroom so mum has just
brought all this furniture over for my
brother he's away at the moment so I've
got all of his furniture here in my
front room just did my first grocery
shop so it's for heaps of stuff just to
load up the pantry
all right is that's done I've filled up
the cupboards looking a little bit more
homely now it was intended to be a fruit
bowl but it is now a vegetable home some
ice creams and some mixed berries for my
smoothies definitely just digging the
plants I think having plants everywhere
just makes it look super fresh an area
and this is our cozy little bed area put
some mirrors up okay so I think the last
time you saw this room it had boxes
everywhere and it's still obviously not
gonna hurt the tidy set up a few shelves
and I've put all my clothes away I'm
finally finishing off editing at the New
York flog I finally got the footage that
I wanted which I thought that there
would be a lot more but there was a
little 20-second clip which is still
awesome here was an awesome videographer
but I've just decided to just chuck it
at the front of the vlog and then just
continue the rest of the stuff that I
filmed so I'm exporting that now and
hopefully I will get that up soon and
then I'm gonna start editing this look
as well so I've called up and I've got
Foxtel and my internet and electricity
and everything being set up this week
has so annoying the Internet's gonna
take about a week so I'm not gonna have
too many videos for you guys this week
unless I go home and upload but yes so
internet I got the fastest one possible
to be set up next week so I'm keen and
I'm hoping it's gonna be like the
easiest thing ever to upload videos from
now and what else has happened not much
really like I've just been unpacking and
just been completely on social dead to
the world my cousin's 21st was yesterday
so that was nice I got to see my family
and mom came over today to have a look
that's bright and early on a Tuesday
morning I'm gonna go over back to my
house upload my New York video to get it
up for approval from Maybelline just to
make sure that there's nothing
inappropriate come home I'm gonna have a
look at a gym that's named me because I
need time to sign with the gym all I've
been doing is eating your braids and not
exercising good love to have gone higher
than like got my nails done and my
eyelashes refilled but I just don't have
time to like at the moment maintenance
beauty something's just got to wait a
little while longer I think
oh no I've really got 2% left I was
gonna vlog tonight
maybe I'll just end the vlog here then I
can just start charge up my camera and
stop logging again tomorrow so I hope
that you guys have enjoyed this video I
was a little bit shocked by the way that
I made my flat look I'm a very messy
person I'll be the first to admit that
but when I started filming when I showed
you guys what the couch looks like that
was after me and Kate had taken all my
products from lots of different places
and dumped it there so I don't live in a
jungle like that all the time I mean I
am messy but I wasn't that messy so I
just wanted to put that out there
because I watched it and I was like I
look like a grub I look like the
dirtiest human ever I'm gonna keep
talking this way to try and get sort of
the things in my life these interesting
moving things in my life going down
packing and everything like that I
haven't fully unpacked any to go to Ikea
so hopefully I'll remember to bring you
guys there and came out and everything
in just buy some home decor I've done
the all the boring things this week like
internet Foxtel setting up my
electricity and water and gas and
everything like that which there's not
much I can log but all the exciting home
decoration decor stuff will be coming
next week so stay tuned for that itself
anyways my camera's lish gonna die I
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you next time love you all so much
