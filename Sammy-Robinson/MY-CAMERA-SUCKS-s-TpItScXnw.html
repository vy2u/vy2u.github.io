alright I'm in the dark Kimia mother I
just come home from Pilates um seriously
bad hair day this hat is from
hyperactive Trevor here hyper locks
active wet it's basically the one that
has that symbol there but it is leather
but it's also vegan so it's like white
like because I never show you guys my
active wear outfit so this top is
Topshop as always these pants are C
Foley which have a very cool design
they're so red again
mm-hmm this camera guys I swear to god
it's a great camera but it does a lot of
things wrong oh man awake she's reading
my diary so I look fallen again but it's
just won't stop watering I'm allergic to
Bambi land as I've ever told you guys
that but I'm actually allergic to my cat
and so whenever I Pat her I always get
like with a watery eyes but yes I don't
know if I've said welcome to this like
how I said it other day welcome to this
vlog and I've decided I want to start
making a lot more of a conscious effort
to tell you guys what I'm wearing what
is on my face because majority of the
comments are always what's on your lips
what are you wearing what was their
clothes are back from where as
everything's I'm going to start making a
massive conscious effort to tell you
guys where everything is from so with
that being said Rimmel have come out
with their the only one matte lipsticks
and this shade is 710 set up it's just
such a good everyday nude how pretty is
that and the reason I like it is because
I don't like wearing liquid lipsticks on
an everyday basis because so drying and
really uncomfortable so this one is good
because it feels like a lip balm like
it's really moisturizing so it is 11
a.m. I just got back and been doing a
little bit of work and I'm gonna I'm
think I'm going to go to the post office
now pick up a few of my parcels and then
I might get a coffee with Laura I
haven't seen her in a while so yeah and
tomorrow I'm gonna film a video with
today's we're going to film the
Australians try American candy I've seen
that video all over all over the
internet for so long and I was like bite
the bullet just do it why not get to eat
lots of candy in a video I want days to
come in video because I know you guys
will love her and then on Thursday I'm
going to be filming a Topshop haul it's
going to be a dresses one this time
Friday we have an island party and then
Saturday we've got my brother's first
game back in AFL for me and mechanic is
going to go watch I'm going to go watch
the AFL so yes it's going to be a good
week going to be nice and packed very
busy lots of editing to do a lot of
other work to do and then Lord mial has
just begun so yeah show you guys many
glasses so I got one pair from Sunday
somewhere and one pair from Rick's
eyewear and how cool they are bee-utiful
are they I'll link them down in the
description box if you guys want to go
check them out
I'm going to wear the ray-bans today
okay so I'm on my way to the post office
now I'm going to pick up whatever
parcels are there for me and then we
meet Laura for a coffee
I really worry about not the notice
people's origami always very much the
sunny day today in Sydney finally still
had a class it's still kind of cloudy
but compared to what it's been like
we've got some blue skies and we've got
some music playing for us oh my God my
shutters didn't open
you've gotta kidding me what is wrong
with my camera guys I think it's it
telling me I need a new one I feel like
every single time I do a weekly vlog it
always includes me going to this damn
post office but that is my life and I'm
sorry I'm boring
classic post office shot
yes daddy boom so the nice thing I swear
I was showing you guys like a second ago
how funny it was and now it looks like
it's literally about to rain
what is with Sydney at my mouth
literally goes from like Christine Sun
beautiful weather
like raining and cyclonic hurricane now
getting not quiet but it's my ears that
look so bad in half own it the last 10
days is just being crazy crazy weather
and we've got this really fun oh I'm red
I'm getting a new camera this is just
crazy I give up
can you hear that thunder what is
happening
good morning go so it is 8:30 in the
morning
I'm having a Chobani oats with ancient
greens for brekkie and it's a really
beautiful day outside so winter's coming
and I ordered myself a few things from
princess Polly I've never really been
one to wear boots and I saw these and
because you guys know how tall I am I
just hate having a heel but these are
quite pretty and they don't have much of
a feel so I'm just not going to try
these out hopefully they will fit me and
I got myself another celebrity skin by
Jeff lystad but this is my definitely my
go-to it's like my favorite nude at the
moment I ordered these because they look
like the mod stars that I had ages ago
and I used to tie them all the time but
they'd be sold out so that I could get
these and show you guys and then I also
got these two necklaces because you guys
always love my choker as well so this is
the necklace the other one I got is
exactly the same but it has a moon and
here is the moon so that's gorgeous as
well and my one is usually a star and
then they also have a ring like this
which I know you guys asked for heaps as
well so I'll link that down below - and
so then these are the Sony's and the
lipstick hi guys so it is quite ok this
way - since Wednesday Wednesday today
and I've got this scallywag over because
robot saw some video together this is
the first video I filmed with like a non
youtuber friend and you've been there
with tiny I love it let's let's go a
weird part it's gonna be weird for me to
only talking to a camera everywhere for
me to spit out I have the camera set up
and be like oh sorry guys like she'll
see me in my element
so yeah well if you I don't know which
one it'll already be up so we're doing
the Australian tries American handy
we are so much forward to success - I am
but I got some gross stuff so actually
hasn't seen it so if you guys want to
see that video or haven't seen that
video already I'll link it down below
alright what do you think of the
lighting dr. Silas yeah absolutely
so we've just completed the I'm trying
American candy and this bean boozled
challenge now we're like sitting in the
aircon so this always happens Daisy
knows what it's like now to film and get
really hot and exhaust you get like you
get because you're sitting up straight
and you're kind of sort of getting a bit
nervous of how the camera and you just
don't know why you just get really
sweaty
really this is because I don't know I
literally have no excite-ation for it
but yeah so we're just going to chill in
the bed and I'm going to start editing
because I didn't in processor for the
fences thank you so as I don't anything
too embarrassing in Baia
