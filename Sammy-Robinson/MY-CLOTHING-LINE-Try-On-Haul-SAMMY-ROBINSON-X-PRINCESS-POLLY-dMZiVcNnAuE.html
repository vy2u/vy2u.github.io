is gonna be in my description box I'm
gonna make it first live so you guys can
go click straight ahead
whoa let's do it I suppose first things
first is the jumper that I'm wearing on
the day that we did this shoot it
started pouring with rain and that was
our very very last shot that we got of
the day you'll see in the clip that I'll
be putting it at the top I'm kind of
going ah because it's raining I like oh
my god it's really really cold and
firing and we were all just so tired I
was so jet like so I didn't really get a
good shot of this jump up that's why I'm
wearing it today so that I can show you
guys in my shoot I wore the brown and
the white version of this in a size 8
but I actually am wearing the size 12
now because I prefer it big and baggy
the reason I made this jumper was I want
it to be big and cozy and comfy and
stuffed I've done these huge bail
sleeves because I think it's so
flattering I wanted a big gap here but
also for it to be elasticated so that
it's not just hanging down it's like
quite flattering on the wrists I find I
actually have a similar jumper where I
don't know where I got it from but it's
actually down to my sort of knee it's
not as my knees that it's down halfway
through my thighs it's a dress and I
hated that I wanted to create a jump I
think we nailed it
and so this brown one which I'll
obviously insert clips for you guys is
my favorite of the collection because I
wanted it in a tan color I think it's so
cozy I feel like a big teddy bear when
I'm wearing it such a beautiful tone
it's such a beautiful tone for winter
I'm obsessed with it his jumpers are
both handmade so they take so long to
make they're extremely good quality they
are so soft I can't even explain to you
guys and then nice and thick so I wanted
it to be a winter jumper that was
actually cozy I find a lot of fashion
jumpers out there it's really hard to
kind of could jump up that looks really
cool but then is actually warm so I
biggest thing as well was that I wanted
to be really worn and thick yuck I
called this jumper here the Jessica
after my sister
and this guy here was actually supposed
to be called choppers and I was so
excited for it to be called the chukkas
jungler because you can chuck it on be
big and baggy on Sunday and hungover
sugars greasy meal in your cozy jumper
and it feels just great those a bit of
miscommunication and it ended up getting
called the Pat which is so cool it's
still relevant cuz it's my dad that's my
dad's name and I love my dad more than
anything this is the chokers okay sorry
dad
alright next up we have the Daisy pads
and the Daisy crop I wanted a really
long sleek pair of pants that were
really flattering its high waisted but
it doesn't go tight around your thighs
it's a gray and white small check print
they're fitted at the waist which was
important to me for you girls out there
that have like a bigger butt and legs
you'll understand I mean this we've
created definitely a lot longer than a
lot of pants that you guys will wear
because I actually want them to drape
the floor now when I wear pads I think
there's nothing cooler than having pet
like a pair of pants actually touch the
floor and not crop off so small girls
that you buy this set you might need to
wear heels that's cool like I want it to
touch the floor so the top is a little
crop this took us a few guys to get
right because originally I wanted it
just to be like a tie that anyone could
tie around their boobs and have it as
tight or loose as they want and then
have the balloon sleeves but it just
didn't work because every time you'd
move or like slouch it would just the
boobs would come out so we ended up
having to go with this this gorgeous
bust with a boning in it so that it's
really secure you can literally Bend and
slouch forward and it wouldn't come off
there's a lot of styles out there right
now that are coming in with that ruching
also I wanted to make it really comfy
and cool and it's casual but can be
dressy like you can wear it just to like
a brunch or you can wear it with heels
to an event I love it and it's called
the Daisy after my best friend Daisy has
been my best friend since year 7 he's
taught me so much I love her and I will
explain something off to have she's so
important to me next up we have the
grand effect in the Bambi shirt and
Bambi shorts there's top in particular
I've been wearing like
every day because it is a really
beautiful good quality thick linen it
has a raw hem I really wanted it to look
really unstructured and easy and
effortless so you can see so we've
purposefully left it super roar on the
edge I didn't wanted to look business
shirt like I know that I love wearing
shirts but sometimes I do feel like when
I wear a shed I'm like I look like a boy
don't I so I wanted it to be as feminine
as possible so I also decided to keep
the buttons quite large and
tortoiseshell so that again it doesn't
work out the business shirt I love how
this badge looks with the tortoiseshell
we kept all the buttons the same so that
everything throughout the collection
sort of matches the shirt is oversized
so it's supposed to be oversized I wear
a size 8 but that looks big on me still
because it's supposed to be that way
like I want it to be a big baggy cool
shirt so you guys can go down or up
depending on what you take from that now
the shorts are so flattering and so cool
because they have this paper bag waist
these shorts are the most flattering
pair of shorts I've ever owned
I'm gonna be wearing these every single
day when I go to Europe like these are
the most beautiful linen pair of shorts
ever this will fit everyone because this
will go really tight around their little
little teeny waists and then if you have
a little bit of a bigger way it's like
it just stretches a bit but it fits
everybody like it's so comfortable on
each pair of pants that I've designed
I've got my little patch so I wanted to
add to the really vintage look of it
which has patches on the back of pants I
think it's so cool and I love when it's
brown so I've designed a little Rose
here to go on the back of all the pants
and just to keep it all again working
together next up we have the two boob
tube dresses now these dresses I love
they're so flattering on a figure this
dress is just so hot like it's very
tight it's not up everyone's alley I'll
just make sure that this long dress
which is called the chocolate which is a
really deep chocolate brown had a slit
at the back of it so it's easy to walk
in a little bit of tube dresses you
literally put her along like this and
you can hardly walk but this you can
easily walk in so the fabric is really
really thick so you're not going to have
like bumps and lumps and
everything hanging out all the time it's
a really good study really sucks you in
my god it makes me feel really good
because it really makes me feel sucked
in and I'm really secure super super
sophisticated with like a black parent
stiletto heels or a nude pair of heels
and like slicked back hair just like a
pair of sunnies no your hair out and
have your white sneakers on like I love
that it's super versatile and similarly
we have this little sort of it's like a
baby G like a baby grayish which I just
thought it was a really interesting
color both of these dresses are cotton
spandex Jersey so it's just really thick
and good-quality this one I just wanted
to make for the party girl I wanted to
bring out something like a little bit
summaries I made sure both of them had
this sticky it's like sticky plastic
that just stays up so it never falls
down you ever feel the need to pull it
pull it up so it's really really secure
oh and this one is called the Donna
dress after Donna from suits because
I've just finished suits and I'm
obsessed with Donna and I want to be
Donna so this is the dollar dress and
I'd say this is like a mushroom color
like a grazie Beijing mushroom no next
we have my absolute favorite thing in
the collection I've worn it already so
many times and you guys would have seen
it all in my stories it's my Sammie
dress I named this the Sammie dress
because this is my ultimate perfect maxi
dress I don't know about you guys but if
you wear maxi dresses you would know
that it's so hard to find a good maxi
that like slings or is very flattering
to your body but then doesn't frickin
flare out at the end I can't stand that
and I just I hate boxy maxi dresses it
was so important to me to find a maxi
dress fabric that would slim to your
body but be super comfortable and not
too tight but then would also just as
you stand just like fall to the floor
and as you walk it moves with you and
flows with you so this dress like as you
watch and it's not constricting at all
that you can walk you can take leaps and
strides in this dress it's a beautiful
ribbed knit fabric which from far away
you wouldn't be able to tell because you
think it's like some really beautiful
fancy fabric but it's literally so
comfortable the only looks tight because
it's literally just falling to my finger
and it'll fall to anyone's figure as
well I personally think halter neck is
the most flattering
doing things so I've brought up to
Walter next my collection yeah and it
was super important to me that it could
be dressed up for a formal event like
you could wear it do a formal if you
wanted with heels
it was also super important that you
could wear it with stickers which is
what I did to my event I wore it just
with some little black sneakers and
socks and it was just sick like I just
loved it that's a little bit a little
bit of what was next now we have the
Gidget set now this is probably another
one of my favorites I love how this
turned out this is the epitome of just a
sick vintage pair of comfortable linen
pants tied around the waist flow nicely
again we chose a really thick linen so
that you can wear in winter but it's
also really nice and loose that you'd be
able to get away with it in summer if
you want it because it's not tight and
hot this is exactly the same as the
shorts at the tops like the paper bag
waist which is so flattering
we do have belt holes if you want to
worry about but you don't need it
because it will be tight around your
waist
this again is super easy to dress up or
down I wear these pants with black heels
and a little black top like a little
black crop and it looks super dressy and
really sophisticated I actually love the
look of the shirt of this with denim
jeans or the shirt of this with the
beige shorts and I just compliment each
other really nicely
I've worn this shirt with my limb shorts
that looks really cool as well that is
after my beloved first child Gidget out
dog next up one of the coolest things in
the range I think that simile is the
Mandy set now this is named after my mom
my mom in Iraq I love her so much
freaking love mom everything that I'm
wearing on this day in this shoot is a
size eight I would actually probably go
like two or three sizes up to give it
more of a baggy look because I want it
to be huge like I want it to be really
big I would love to wear this with a
massive pair of black stiletto heels
slick my hair down in a like a low bun
like this and wear like a bold brown lip
or something it just looks so cool I
love how this turned out you can style
it so many different ways this one is
really cool because you obviously you
can put it with sneakers in a hat and
you can wear it down to
Coffee and it will look really casual on
a Sunday but I just think you can dress
it up and make it look sick put a black
lacy bra light underneath it and have it
zipped all the way down so it's super
sexy so I'm going to try and style it up
in a few different ways and including
blogs to show you guys different ways
that I will style it this is perfect for
festivals so if any of you guys are
going to splendor you should pick this
up I'd say right so next we have the
Chiquitita set so we've got the
Chiquitita top which is a bandeau top
you would have seen it in my I inserted
some clips wearing my linen beige linen
set and that was what I was wearing
underneath it it's actually a quarter
like a cream-colored corduroy set the
top is a zip at the back the pads as
well are based off like a pair of jeans
so they're high-waisted kind of baggy
and loose so they're almost like a mom
Jean but they're in a corduroy beige and
I really I just thought colder it was a
perfect addition to the vintage range
that I've tried to bring out again you
can dress up and down again you can put
the corduroy pants with anything you can
put it with like a little black midriff
you can put it with a big oversized
jumper a t-shirt like it's super casual
but super versatile and you can put the
bando with anything like anything
everything in this range is supposed to
look oversized except for the tight
dresses I called that the Chiquitita
crop and pant because I am an absolute
shocker for Abba I grew up listening to
ABBA we all danced around the house
listening to musicals Disney songs and
Abba and my mom is just a between so I
wanted to do call them like dancing
queen or Melanie or something but I just
thought it was just triggers heat I was
a little different and it was cute now
we have the Katy halter which is
literally k-t after my little sister if
any of you guys have seen my sister you
know that she is my little twin so much
the same as me and so I thought it would
be cute to bring out the baby version of
the dress which I called the satiny so
it's like the mini-me which this is the
Katy this halter neck goes with every
single thing in the range you can put it
with the shorts the pants the jeans
which I'm about to show you that you
can't eat are corduroy say anything I
just wanted to have a little simple
basic that would match anything it's
again that beautiful rib
fabric which this is the this is the
fabric of the dress I wanted them to
match because they were just such a
fluttering cool fabric all right now
finally last but certainly not least the
Robinson Jane's I think if you of you
gonna be really excited about these sons
I am so excited about these ones these
jeans I wear every single day I've never
found a more perfect pair of jeans in my
entire life
how does it bring out something that I
could recreate for you guys and just
give you just give you my favorite piece
of clothing ever I've brought you guys
the Robinson James and the Sally Rhodes
a days I couldn't be happier with how
these turned out obviously they're not
exactly the same we've got this gorgeous
brown accent on the back we've got the
brown accents in the pockets they it's a
beautiful it's a little bit lighter
about denim than the one iron it's a
little darker but I actually like this
really vibrant blue in denims I stay
clear of like black and gray denims I'd
like you to be really vibrant I think it
looks really good with his head good
this together like don't you think that
that blue just goes beautifully with the
beige but oh my god I don't even know to
say about these I'm so excited to be
bringing these out for you guys because
you guys ask me all the freaking time
where my jeans are from and I can't tell
you because they don't exist anymore
they're just like an old pair of vintage
denim that someone would have got rid of
years ago okay I would have designed my
own pair of them take all my favorite
parts of those jeans and put it into a
pair of jeans for you guys just makes me
so happy my favorite thing ever to do is
my beige linen shirt with these jeans
match made in heaven
my khaki shirt with these jeans match
made in heaven so oh my god I am so
excited I'd also like to mention at the
end that I do indeed have a brother and
because I wasn't intending to pull
anything Pat I obviously didn't cut
anything dad they're boys names and now
it does look like I've left him out so
