hotel right now sitting on the ground i
am i wanted to Selma get ready with me
for Coachella but just wasn't going to
work out it looks all right on my
vlogging camera has at specific angles
but it was just not non- background no
no setting and we were always in a rush
constantly running around trying to get
things done so I thought when I got to
the Beverly Hills Hotel I would just sit
down and show you the exact makeup that
I did every single day I always go for
my natural look I go for what I know is
best on me so that's what I went from
with my face in the base and then every
day I changed up my lipstick I don't
even know if I'm so if I've told you
guys I've been to Coachella that was the
worst introduction that ever what the
hell did I say I prefer jela and I was
lucky enough to be sent over by Estee
Lauder GHD and princess Polly so I'm
working with them in this video every
product I have used is incredible as I'm
sure you guys know Estee Lauder is a
stunning brand it's got such beautiful
products yeah so I put my robe on I love
putting the hotel rooms on and I just
have setup by the window sitting on the
ground it's much better lighting here so
yeah I'm going to show you guys what I
did every day for Coachella if you guys
want to see the lipsticks that I wore
that'll be in my Coachella vlog so I'm
probably going to do a different
lipstick today just to mix things up
because that'll be in the other video
anyway but let's go into getting ready
okay so every single day I started off
with my Estee Lauder the illuminizer the
illuminator radiance primer
I love radiance primers because it's
sort of a two-in-one and it gives you
that moisturizing feeling and then also
just gives you the most beautiful
radiance to your skin so then I mixed my
sa water Double Wear foundation with my
champagne glow highlighter I'm not the
biggest fan and have never been the
biggest fan of good up I will good on
day one I just felt like it just looks
so silly on me I don't know I've never
been much of a glitter girl so instead
of gooder
I like to go with radiance and so this
is the most beautiful combination I
shade is four and two spiced sand a
little bit goes so it's such a beautiful
day today in LA we're going to do a
makeup Anand go exploring probably
yes I got my diamonds floating I heard
wouldn't look orange hey hol can you
please turn that Lambo looks so orange
in the background yes then I went in
with my double a concealer this is just
like a few shades lighter than my
foundation because I like to have a nice
bright under I get rid of the dark
circles so I like to use really thin
layers and everything because it was so
hot every single day and like if you
just went and looked too much it just
instantly melted up your skin so using
really thin layers it won't show that
it's taking or sweating off it'll just
make it sit a lot easier on your skin
and then I like to take this product
again put it obviously on the high
points of my face this is so beautiful
it's a cream highlighter so yeah if you
guys want to see my vlog from Coachella
I'm not sure I built the up yet or will
be coming up after this video but make
sure you keep an eye out for it because
I'm going to be editing that very soon
and uploading it to you so just set my
under eyes I used the loose perfecting
powder I didn't like baking because it
wasn't completely translucent and it
would've really showed up if I like try
to pack it under my eyes so I just took
a fluffy brush and sort of lightly set
it like like I used to and I sort of
just took a big powder brush and
actually powdered the rest of my face we
were wearing it all day I like to make
sure my foundation was really set in
place so then I loved having a really
really really brandy looks I took my
brown butter bronzing powder and I just
took heat that it basically just runs up
the whole outer perimeter of my face I
never really contoured I just liked to
keep it really soft but uh quite
sunkissed to makeup I just basically
wanted it to be under I wanted it to be
as simple as possible but really radiant
because I didn't want it to take away
from my outfits the first day I was good
Erin aid
I really regret excelsis like I feel
stupid I don't I like going on my body
just not really so much my face
you guys are going to die as it is I
actually have no idea what it is because
it's just got a whole bunch of numbers
on the back you can see that I think
it's the Victoria Beckham highlighter
are you ready
look at this so I basically bathe this
all over my body did not hold back
basically put it everywhere gosh I hope
it's showing up in this light
it's probably not really not my eyes I
am I've always hated having dark eyes as
you guys know by like basically every
one of my videos and the other two
really really quite natural eyes I just
can get suits me to that so I wanted to
go with what I know and what suits me so
I like taking my bronzer or a really
warm tone transition which helps perfect
with this as a transition transition
shade just placed that through my crease
just to warm it up that's not so wise
indifferent to the face I then took this
highlighter and I put it all over my lid
and all over my cheddar I just think
that's the most flattering on me on my
eyes so I just wanted everything just to
be super bright now for lips I've got so
many lipsticks I brought I am so
obsessed with this range of lipids his
range is called the pure color love
lipstick I only brought a few of them
but there's heaps of them in the range I
brought like a dark berry a blue lots of
nudes a bright red so I wasn't sure
which looks I was going for so I ended
up obviously doing the bright red on the
last day I did a nude on the first day
and then this gorgeous blue of sheer
shade so I thought it was gonna be super
opaque when I could on but when I
brought my lips it sort of really shared
out so you guys will be able to see that
in my Coachella vlog if it is brought
like life it's a pinky nude tone so I
might take a darker one and a lighter
one and make sort of an ombre I'm going
to start off with the double wear lip
pencil in tawny and just line my lips
I'm going to start with raw sugar on the
outside and now I'm going to put the
Lay's buff on the inside oh that's so
pretty
so now I'm going to do my hair and
obviously I got my hair done by DHD
everyday so I did not do though Taylors
and I'm not that talented brought over
my PhD wanderlust it's the new
collection for GHD it's not like
beautiful colorful patterns all over it
and I'm just going to do light waves
with the straight mat okay
my hair we all know and not the best of
hair so I don't have that I'm very
limited in my abilities and what I can
do but I'll show you guys how I curl my
hair when I curl a little straight now
I'm going to take this rogue off because
I'm wearing a bikini under me because I
know I'm going to get really hot so yeah
you will I'm not wearing a bra if you
guys wondering it's from a layer so it's
a very beautiful bikini just a really
hot day today and I can't curl my hair
when I'm hot it's just impossible so I
never do my hair I just get to the point
where it needs to be done and I go map
on to hearts and to city is the root
lift to give myself a bit of volume
because I am a little bit flat on top
and then also the curls help spray and
the jxd so from Sydney taught me how to
use this when I went like a week or so
ago so with the root spray if you're
supposed to really use it when it your
hair is wet but I just like to section
my hair off and just give it to spray
and then I just sort of judged it up a
bit going fray they said you can either
do it all over and then sort of dry it
out or you can take it section by
section
so take section then I lightly spray it
because you don't want it to be soaking
but you want it to be a little bit down
dries really quickly and then I take the
straightener this is the new
straightener this is the new edition
that I was talking about take the
straightener and I just twist the barrel
around and I pull it through and it just
sort of twists backwards lightly because
I don't like the front well being too
hectic and once I get past the front bit
because for me I don't like going
backwards the whole way along I just
take this straightener roll the hair
over the top and twist and I just go all
the way down the length of my hair the
top and twist
he stopped coming up so long when it was
short and just sort of lost the ability
of like styling my hair so I'm slowly
getting back into it now that my hair is
a bit longer but and then I'll just like
behind on doing the other side I am so
lucky that I had Patrick doing my hair
at Coachella I had the coolest
hairstyles because of Patrick he did
beautiful long mermaid waves and made
his first day and then the second day I
had I had the coolest top not bun which
sort of had like a braid at the back of
it with like a piece of rings I'll
insert some photos now showing you guys
and then the third day I had the coolest
twist he put four twists in my hair yes
I'm very happy with how every up every
hair turned out with every outfit by the
way I sprayed this side all sort of at
once with the help curl hold spray
before and then I'm going to spray it
again and then just take the hair brush
and just sort of lightly brush them out
because I want them to just be super
soft you just got this like really nice
bouncy like you'd call it like
Victoria's Secret hair because I don't
really know how that man how they do the
hair but I like how they have those
really natural waves in their hair if
you know what I mean so everything in my
outfit is princess Polly I'll show you
guys obviously an overall outfit shot
yeah so everything all the jewels -
socks everything is princess Polly this
is one of my backup outfits which I
didn't end up wearing but I thought it
