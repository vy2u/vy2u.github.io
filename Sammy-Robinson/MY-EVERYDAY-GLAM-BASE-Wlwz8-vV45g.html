recently and I've done a lot of get
ready with me recently but I haven't
done anything really particular about a
certain area and this is sort of my
foundation routine when it's a little
bit more full coverage but still that
going for that really natural-looking
skin so I guess I don't know what I'm
gonna title this video yet but all I do
know is I want to convey to you guys how
I achieve my natural looking skin that
lasts all night so it's like I guess
it's my full glam foundation routine but
it's still quite natural if that makes
sense okay so to begin with primers I
really love using primers but it doesn't
necessarily matter to me which primers I
use so like I'll always use the primer
but whatever primer I have will work for
me but today I just really want to try
the brightening youth glow glow booster
I'm Charlotte Tilbury so yeah even
though yes it's not my everyday priming
routine I don't what I'm trying to say
is I don't have an everyday prime oh I
use really any anything I used
moisturizers to get that really luminous
glow what I've been doing actually is
putting a bit of highlighter underneath
my foundation not necessarily a straight
on top of it so I love love love love
this this is the Anastasia liquid glow
and it's in the shade Perla and I
basically take that and I just messily
put on all the high points of my face
this stuff is crazy as well it will be
pretty subtle under the foundation but
because the foundations are used a
generally quite lightweight so they
don't fully cover up the prime-minister
we've put underneath it's my skin so far
sorry that I'm looking in the viewfinder
it's firstly it's like almost impossible
not to how do you scare me but I don't
have a mirror and
with me so I'm gonna be looking a little
bit in that direction now the foundation
that I've been loving is the estee
lauder double wear nude water fresh
foundation and if you guys love the if
you guys love the double wear foundation
but you think but you like me and you
think it's a little bit too heavy you're
gonna love this because I love the
double wear like it gives me the most
flawless finish
it lasts all day like oh god I reckon I
could sleep in and it would be the same
I can't wear it all the time because I
don't like wearing thick makeup so when
they came out with this I was like yes
that's so good so this is the one I'm
using today and it's in the shade spiced
sand for n2 so I'm just gonna top that
on my face is just like my perfect shade
I poured way too much on I feel like a
really flawless finish I just I will
always opt for a beauty blender or a
Real Techniques sponge or anything of
that sort really you can't go wrong with
the Beauty Blender it will always make
your foundation or anything you put on
your face for that matter look flawless
I'll be right back I gotta go in a
mirror
sorry Nick can you please close my door
yeah it's pretty hard this foundation is
just stunning if you guys are like me
and you like your lightweight
foundations you will love love this
foundation and it just gives the most
beautiful coverage it's not heavy it's
not cakey it just sinks into this again
this one has an SPF of 25 in it which
for me I love I need my makeup to have
sunscreen in there like that's the best
part of me
these days is finding everyday
foundations that helps the protection so
and so now I'm moving on for concealer
I've run out of my top shape tape I also
use my Sigma one and I've also been
mixing up between this Mac one go for
this one I find doesn't crease it's not
too cakey or heavy brightens my eyes up
really nicely and I just yeah I just
think it's really comfortable so I like
to put that on the center points of my
face and by the way this is in the shade
NC 30 and then I just go back in with my
Beauty Blender and I just blend that out
although it looks like I had a lot on my
face I didn't that was one pump and I've
still got heaps on the back of my hand
it just looked crazy cuz it's all it's a
lot lighter than my skin tone and you
guys know the drill I love my cream
contouring cream bronzing so my clinic
is my all-time favorite
it's the Clinique chubby stick in curvy
contour and I use a brow show you my
Beauty Blender I use anything for this
really it's so easy to blend out it just
brings the dimension back into the face
a little bit I feel like I haven't done
like my full glam look with you guys and
so long because it's been somewhere and
it's been so hot but this foundation I
actually can wear on those like 40
degree days and like it doesn't it
doesn't matter because it's super
lightweight it doesn't make me feel
sweaty or anything that's all I'll do
for cream cream products but now the key
to making it stay in place all day
and to make to making it a really long
wearing foundation look is baking and I
don't bacon leave heaps and heaps of
powder on my face I kind of just push
powder into my skin so so I'll take my
Laura Mercier translucent powder as
always and I take my Beauty Blender and
I take like the smallest amount like
that and I just push it into my under
eyes first setting the concealer so you
can see I'm not baking I'm actually just
like pushing it into the skin this locks
your foundation and concealer down
literally for hours like it it's like
almost hard to get off and I always bake
my eyelids as well cuz they always
crease and then I actually take the
sponge with more powder and I actually
set my t-zone to like all the middle
part of my face because you don't want
it to be overly powdery but you do need
a little bit of something something to
set it down if you're gonna be wearing
it all night so then for the rest of my
face I mix up with my powders all the
time
I love the hourglass ambient lighting in
dim light it keeps like it sets your
face with them keeps the shine there so
I love that I do like the Mac Studio Fix
fluid if I'm going for like more of a
matte look sometimes I use my Bobbi
Brown one and the reason that I love
this Bobbi Brown one is because it's
super warm toned and I'd took a little
bit of bronze enos to my skin but today
I want to go for that luminous look so
I'm going to take dim light and just set
the outer parts of my face now to add a
little bit of extra bronze eNOS to my
skin I'll need to take my L'Oreal glam
bronze and just my little zoeva brush
and just runs up my cheeks
about putting it down my nose I mean a
life back into the face do it like a
dagger let's talk probably
it's my mom's top guys playing bronze
brushed my eyelids
now my favorite highlighter at the
moment has been the Becca opal highlight
and this is just stunning
I just use a tiny little bit of my face
like it's crazy
glow today honey this foundation it's
not real it makes you look completely
airbrushed it's crazy
craziness insanity I'm telling you I
lost up to the skin is to take mac fix+
or any setting spray but this is the one
I'm in loving at the moment and now I'm
just going to finish off my makeup while
I'm on camera with you guys so I'm just
gonna put on some gimme brow it threw my
eyebrows so I'm gonna take the new Estee
Lauder pure color and be liquid matte
liquid lipsticks I've been wearing the
nude ones of these and I really want to
show you guys the nude ones but I'm
gonna spice it up but I'm gonna do a
berry lip today the formula of these
lipsticks are crazy the thinnest
consistency I have ever felt so that's
the lips done oh the formula of this you
guys have to go try it out like it's
just ridiculous this one is in 304 quiet
riot and it's just like the things think
so I've used the matte one today but
they have a metallic in the collection
and they have a final which I believe is
like a high pigment gloss
but you know I'm all about that matte so
I had to go with the matte yes
so that is my foundation routine you
guys can see on camera like this camera
doesn't have a blurring filter anything
so hopefully it's picking up how
beautiful it makes my skin look ice
method so this foundation with the
baking method
I honestly believe that is what makes my
skin like look so nice anyway I hope it
looks that way by the way excuse also
the secret to luminous skin is drink
lots of water huh so yes I hope that you
guys have enjoyed this video I would
love if you guys let me know any of your
tips and tricks for beautiful healthy
and natural looking skin I'm always down
