channel today I have an extremely
exciting video it's one of my first ever
lip swatch videos and I've got oh yeah
sir many lipsticks here like I'm
dropping everywhere there's like oh my
god let me count one sec okay so if I've
counted correctly I've got 18 shades 9
matte shades for metallic shades and
then 5 vinyl shades which is super cool
so basically the other day I filmed a
video and I was wearing one of these
pure color and B matte I literally can't
say I was wearing one of the matte
shades in a video and they saw how much
I loved the shade like the formula of
these lipsticks is just like out of this
world isn't this finished liquid
lipstick I've ever tried so they reached
out to me saw that I loved their formula
and were like would you like all of them
and I was like yes for you so with that
being said I'm not gonna ramble on free
just cuz there is a lot there is a lot
of shades just watch I'm gonna go
straight into it I'll probably put a
mess music over the top and played as a
bit of a montage and I'll put the name
of whatever I'm using somewhere on the
screen at least the number and then I'll
list everything down below as well in
case you want to UM go buy yourself some
too
ah yeah so let's jump straight into it
thank you so much yesterday a lot of
sending me all these and I love you
formulas you guys are awesome I've
prepared myself a full pack of these
cotton pads and a full bottle of micelle
water
I've been
I will say as well although I know from
experience because it's one of my
favorite lipsticks that it stays on so
well and so long that they're actually
really easy to remove like it's not hurt
my lips sorry I literally just opened up
my other shut up so it's a little bit
brighter now but I felt like the Sun was
going behind a cloud so I just had to
change up lighting a little bit so big
flowers on them big Mills got a pocket
full of coupons we going oh well can you
knock out refills got my dimes and a
coffee Vince plan on the JBL stay with
y'all go to sleep unless the Sun is up
think I'm wasting honest I'm feeling
kind of stuck not enough reps funny cats
who report good legs not finished
now dropped out from the school so I
don't woke up and I ain't got no job
should I do the day down this fearless
 up my back up I hear what you gotta
say know what it'd be like an
unimportant
all I'm thinking mutters writing in his
pores I come and me or okay so I
feel like maybe I was wrong maybe I
don't have the whole collection cuz I do
know that I lipstick that I wore in my
video
I didn't just watch this and I think I'm
doing every single shade in the range
from doing all of the ones that they
sent me and all the ones that I have so
there might be a few missing in this
video but I think I'm showing most of
them most likely showing most of them
now I want to move on to the vinyl
shades I've got five of the vinyl shades
here sorry my makeup is just gonna
continuously
my swatches are getting bad guys I'm
losing control
okay so I've resorted to putting
foundation over my lips because they're
red they are very very red fall off
shades we've got the metallics
this is gonna be one of my favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
