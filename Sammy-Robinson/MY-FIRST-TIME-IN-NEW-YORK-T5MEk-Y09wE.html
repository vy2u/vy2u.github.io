little bit tragic obviously traveling

bit of exploring of New York now yes I'm
gonna bring you guys along with me a
little bit today but mostly the tour

exciting because it's for the launch of
the Gigi collection so I haven't had a
look at any of that yet so I'm really
keen to see what that's like like I have
an explorer today and show you guys my
cam but I do know that we are having a
bit of a tour around New York City on
the second day and things like that so
I'm not going to show you guys too much

coffee shop

Bradshaw's house right now from Sex in
the City

my eyes to feel where when I friends

time by myself when I lose
alright guys if it was to wear today but
we are about to go into the World Trade
Center
and apparently it's really beautiful all
white inside
Wow

facets of the city beneath us as you
prepare to see forever
what the hell we're just inside
Oh

learning about the Jet Set about the 24
karat dusted sage leaf I had to go wash

flashed in its pretty good at fasted
ages
that's Friday morning it is the morning
of our pretty much our last official day
on the Maybelline Tour and then I fly
out tomorrow but I fly out at 6 p.m. so
I feel like I'll be here for like full
two days but today is the exciting GG
launch so we're gonna be meeting GG
having our master class watching how the
makeup artist puts it on her I think and
then learning about all the new products
and then afterwards there's like a
little to our launch party to kick
things off as well so it's going to be a
really exciting cool day I really don't
have anything to wear so I'm hoping to
do a little bit of shopping this morning
and I don't know how do my hair I mean
I've been wearing out all week and I
really liked it out but I didn't
thinking they did my slick that will say
and then I'm gonna go up to the
penthouse and hang out with everyone we
have a few more activities and things to
do and then I'll start getting ready
probably at around 11:00 exciting times
exciting times
I'm really sad it's the last official
day but I don't feel too sad cuz again
I've got like a pretty pretty long day
tomorrow to do stuff maybe do some
shopping maybe guys a gym like I haven't
usually I like to go to the gym when I
go away because it just kind of makes me
sleep better and just makes me feel like
more energized throughout the trip
that's why I've been so friggin tired
this whole time I haven't just like
sitting on my butt all day it's a
beautiful day today
and so I've pretty much finished my
makeup I just need to do my lip and I'm
gonna use GG's lip so I'm gonna line
them with Maybelline's lip liner in one
one five totally toffee go better
lighting from there isn't it by the way
I totally didn't tell you guys I've
completely forgotten his helper vlog
about my stuff yesterday at the ice
skating rink it was so massive it's so
awkward and now I'm going to use Torah
which is from GG's collection and it's
called GG ten mmm that's so pretty and
that is my makeup done I got my hair
done by the Maybelline Team two thousand
miles until my destination and the
screen in front of me display in all
these constellations I'm on a new
vibration motivated from the side some
highs correlated Asarco well we have
arrived at the launch everyone's sort of
just waiting outside it's and I meant
and they're just continuing to set up
inside then we're gonna have the master
class so I'll show you guys the setup
I'll show you as much as I can
those ways be doing a livestream as well
but I managed to do that just sort of
before she comes on I think just I can't
really do it during the thing it's very
intimate event I'm gonna do my best to
show you guys what I can
it's gonna be a good event I think this
topic keeps falling down and it's
driving me
like those that like clay rooftops
that came from Erlang's small trying to
balance alert is here faces and face the
fact that I haven't made it cop the
latest Caroline Marta basics and when
the morning comes bad I just hated me
light so me moving while that baseball
mitt fair beaten horses this chalk to me
Morton losses losses as a direction for
we're losing depression drank a little
more maybe even gave me some
hey guys so I'm obviously back in
Australia now and my room is a mess you
can see my suitcase is sitting back
there but I realized I've said this on
my blog as well that's probably gone out
before this but I realized that I
haven't actually used any of the JD
stuff on camera and you guys probably
want to say that it's probably a bit
annoying that I went and looked at all
the products and went to the launch
party and then haven't actually you see
me afoot any of it for you guys
and I know that it comes out in
Australia on like the 9th of December I
think in Priceline so I wanted to get
this video up as like a bit of a review
for you guys if in case you're
interested if I hear of it I'm sorry as
well that this video has gone up much
later than when I was in New York I had
a massive issue with my SD card I
snapped it so I lost a bit of the
footage and I've been waiting for the
footage from the videographer that was
in New York anyways without further ado
let's just jump into it this is all this
stuff that I got really like make up and
just test these products out and see how
they go ok so I'm just gonna start out
with tinted primer which is light medium
medium - it's deep her packaging is
absolutely beautiful
I love the baby pink and also I'm sure
that there there are so many reviews out
there if you guys want to see like holes
of the whole products so I do know that
she said that people have misinterpreted
these primers as just being too dark or
not working this medium one that I just
used gave me like a little bit of
coverage and a little bit of color
and it felt really amazing on my skin
and I know that this I've used this one
that medium to deep one which I'll use
today actually as well is for you can
use it as like cream contouring or like
bronzing up your face I can see how dark
that is so I'm going to use it cream
ones
so we left I love cream contour bronzers
I think that's really beautiful it just
gave me like the nicest healthiest like
flush of color on my face now I'm gonna
go into her jetsetter palette and use a
few things from here you don't really
need your exact shades when you have
like two like that cuz you can just mix
them together mixture of both let's see
how that goes
you see I've got darkness in there oh
that actually did a really good job of
brightening that up this would
definitely just be for touch-ups I'd
like you wouldn't want to go crazy but
if you can see like hers again it's
you're like on the go palette so now I'm
gonna tack try this pink shade at the
top it's pretty crazy it's very vibrant
that actually translate it's quite
nicely
it stays quite bright but it doesn't
look like a natural definitely auktioner
they've got strobe creams I chose strobe
cream liquid strobe in gold right up my
alley okay so that's very bronzy oh no
but it melts into the skin really nicely
so it's kind of like so you kind of
blend it in and it's not that
necessarily that detectable just gives
you that like glossy finish that
highlighted as well
anything gold a lot of you guys asked
what it was like meeting her and whether
she thought that we looked alike I
didn't get to meet her long enough for
us to have the conversation about us
looking relatively similar um but she
was beautiful she was so nice she was
very funny when she was presenting so I
am yeah oh she was hilarious too cold I
don't know the gold the golden pinky
ones yeah so I'm gonna run a little bit
of the pink just through my crease just
to warm my crease up
see I don't really know what else to say
about it like it was a very quick
encounter but I mean I was in the room
with her and she was presenting for ages
and she was really cool she was so down
to earth she was very funny now I'm
using I'm gonna mix the gold and the
white ishe just to make like a lighter
gold on my eyelid oh this lipstick I
wore on the day and I loved it so I use
it in this video I'm gonna start with
her lip liner in Torah and now I'm going
in with Torah it's a cool like a cool
toned nude actually that's so we it
looks really great on me now that I have
a tan like when I wasn't and well it's
hand but like Nora's hand it looks like
more of a brownie nude and now that I've
got a tan it's gone great yes that is
the look that I created I'm sorry I
didn't feel like putting too much on my
face but I just wanted to like test out
a few of the things with you guys on
camera actually you know what
well I'm here I want to show you guys
how beautiful the fiery red shade is see
look on the tissue it's like a brownie
nude but on me it looks like grave the
fiery orange red so this one is called
Austin a creamy super buttery and
pigmented every Reds on my favorite and
I've been super into them just recently
so when I saw that she had one in this
collection I was like yeah give it to me
beautiful is that there's something
about orangey-red that just made me feel
so summery and vibrant it's just like
the prettiest shade I'll leave you guys
now so thank you so much for watching I
hope that you guys enjoyed it and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
