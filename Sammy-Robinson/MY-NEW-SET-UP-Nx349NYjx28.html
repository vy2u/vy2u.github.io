lot of my vlogs I've been going to
Mexico actors it's sort of an event I'm
not sure it's sort of a one on one event
with Marc Jacobs I had my gym session
this morning I did boxing and I'm so
obsessed with it now which is such a
change from what I said last time how I
sucked at it but I love it now and then
this opportunity I'll show you guys but
I've been rearranging my dining area
I'm doing sort of a campaign thing with
Maybelline's YouTube channel and sort of
fun with the new Maybelline beauty
creators typically basically a whole new
studio it is insane I'll show you guys
I'm sort of half set it up tomorrow I'm
going to be filming my healthy morning
routine I've had you guys ask for
morning routines for so long now
basically since I started YouTube so I'm
gonna do it and because I've been on a
health kick lately I'm going to do my
healthy money routines the guys in the
video clip for this song it is
sucking oh my god I saw it when I was
gonna wait male star I was like fun fact
about me I used to do singing lessons
when I wanted to be a singer can't
actually sing thought I could but I did
this song
and
yeah
I was
action of putting on time we don't have
to worry about it like separating with
the perfecting this eye you said before
to prep the skin
hey I'm vlogging yes because did you
have a I stopped she took it from me
okay wait wait focus books ready PMS for
me long strokes is the tip don't squirt
young strokes
press the button all the way down I'm at
max MIDI love at the moment and we're
just having a look at all the Marc
Jacobs new summer releases summer yeah
is the way and I'm wearing the shade
Night Fever and hot stuff which is just
like a really nice plummy shade and I
love it because it just makes you look
super flushed
haha
I'm on the highway
yeah looks really young
this is such a cool package from Urban
Decay how amazing is this art that's the
coolest thing ever
I am so obsessed with the packaging on
this this Jergens shea butter oil so for
your body body oil looks so nice and
some food so what you're trying to say
bamboo want some food oh god it's really
confusing going between the two cameras
oh I look tragic still in bed as you can
tell wearing my burger and fried jamas
still yet to figure out the blurring
effect on this camera so forgive me if
that happens I've got to get onto that
first good morning it's about 8:00 a.m.
on a Monday morning very tired but today
I've got a few appointments to go to so
I'm going to go get a pedicure get my
eyebrows waxed I'll go get my eyelashes
in field because they've all fallen out
I'm gonna get everything done I haven't
had my eyebrows waxed or wear eyelashes
in filled since Coachella and I feel
like it's time I've been mayor the bank
um I've got to return some stuff to the
post office but I'm waiting for a
package to arrive before then and then
I've gotta clean my room so that's the
plan for today
so I desperately need to clean my room
but I thought I'd show you my outfit
today I'm wearing a top from assembly a
cardigan from Country Road shorts of my
princess Polly shorts and then I've just
got the classic Gucci and Javan cheese
slides
first off eyelashes so I graded de
lashes and I'm just gonna get I'm going
to get my lashes changed I had the silk
lashes I want to get the acrylic lashes
which are a little bit thinner and more
natural circulation I find in my eyes
that the silk normal lashes that other
people get really drunk and they like
make my eyes look a funny shape so I'm
going to try something else
today afterwards I was going to get a
pedicure but I texted days and she can
do it tomorrow so I think I'll do that
tomorrow with her just so that I can
catch up with someone while I'm doing it
there's no point of me doing it alone
and then but I probably will get my
eyebrows and stuff works because they
are looking at religious at the marriage
and then I've got Pilates at 5:00
tonight yeah there's mums
car mom it's really funny coming down to
the shops because I want to see mom here
she's so funny but see
yep there she is she's at this Shh
something
she didn't say
so I have just finished up at all my
appointments I didn't film in any of
them I always freak out and just try to
do it but I'm I show you guys up close
when I have parked so I got my lashes
infield as you can see I absolutely love
them and my eyebrows tinted so they're
really dark but hopefully they'll fade
so I made an order of a whole bunch of
stuff from a super food store and I
thought I would show you guys so I got
myself a whole bunch of tees I've been
really obsessed with tees in the colder
weather so I've got peach and pineapple
just plain green tea with lemon and
ginger your raspberry leaf tea some
agave syrup because I've been having
porridge lately and I really like it to
be sweet so I got some of that myself
some pure Omega 3 because my Omega 3 is
the sort of best vitamin that you can
take yourself some papaya papaya leaf
extract to put with my water just sort
of makes it easier to drink lots of
water and good for your digestion an
almond butter and a peanut spread digi
high what you got there such a little
popper hmm she doing today because I've
made myself some apple I'm gonna try my
new peanut butter with it so this is the
peanut spread that I bought I bought
this one from Mavis because of this
Henry barking because the ingredients
are just Organic peanuts so there's no
additives which is good okay Tuesday
morning beautiful day outside as you can
see I'm off to Pilates so I hope ladies
person this morning and then I'm gonna
go get a pedicure with days and have a
coffee and then this afternoon I'm gonna
be filming my first video with me
Williams so better properly set up this
studio and I'll show you guys except
about never actually showed you guys
I need to get petrol crap that's been
going on at me like awake has
anyone ever actually had their car
stopped from not having enough petrol
like what I would freak me out
I would not handle that situation well
so I'll show you guys it's in my dining
area it's really cool and I'm excited
it's the first video I'm filming for
them today for their YouTube channel so
make sure you keep an eye out on
Maybelline's channel for the next few
months because because people
like me kardia Heidi and cast we're
going to be doing heaps of videos for
them so if you can't get enough videos
from me you can go onto their channel
and I'll be doing a few videos for that
myself
okay so Pilates has just ended and I'm
gonna go get myself a coffee and a green
juice while I'm waiting for days she's
just about to park a car so should we
care see thank you
wife say hey this is the man behind the
scenes thanks bye days for getting a
pedicure so I'm choosing my Sherlock
color I hope I just want to go classic
baby pink sided tape in that color
are you alright oh so this is my new
setup mum just helped me set it up she's
such a gem
it's basically this up for Maybelline
they want the New York City frame the
love Hut the wallpaper this awesome
mirror and a ring light and they were so
generous I'm so lucky having a few
issues because this is a very big
backdrop which obviously doesn't fit in
my flat anywhere so I've had to put it
here but then the Sun is coming through
here as you can see so it's creating a
Sun shadow so I'm just gonna have to
figure out what time of day I can film
where there's no Sun coming through I
don't have any hope because my flat is
very very sunny plays basically always
has Sun coming through those windows
there's hand-on filming this afternoon
and I cannot I can't know that this
mirror arrived and one of the bowls
wasn't in it so we've bought mums bought
me this one here to fill it but it was
the wrong colour so that's very obvious
and I'm gonna have to figure out how I
can find a bulb that's gonna fit in this
mirror I'm not very good at any of this
but um
cos I'm having a few complications and I
don't really understand how if I'm
filming with a ring light you can see
everything here say where the camera
filming me you can see all the stuff in
the background through the mirror so and
I can't not have stuff showing in the
mirror because I don't have any space in
my flat that was supposed to be my
afternoon and now unfortunately it's not
cuz I just can't with this big Sun
shadow it just doesn't look right I just
wanted to thank Maybelline as well
because look how lucky I am getting this
whole new set up so this is the setup as
you can see it just doesn't look right
with that there it just completely
defeats the purpose of having the
backdrop so I'm gonna have to wake up
early tomorrow and see what time of day
I'll be able to film where there's not
gonna be any Sun coming through I just
took all my makeup off and picked a
pimple yes it has come to that time the
sad time
well I've got to end the vlog so I hope
you guys have enjoyed this video and
I'll see you very soon in another video
because got a really cool event with Max
Media Lab tomorrow which is called the
talent lab it's where they organize a
whole bunch of up-and-coming influences
to come in and when you sort of talk to
them and they ask questions and it's
like a really fun evening so I've got
that tomorrow I'll probably begin
vlogging again I don't think I'm going
to do the whole weekly vlogs anymore I
think I'm gonna try and just get in like
a few days and then do like a few day
blog so it's not boring it's not just a
one day thing but you guys don't have to
wait weeks for it so I'm gonna try and
just scatter them here and there
everywhere I can and then also do my
sit-down videos I hope you guys have
enjoyed these last few days with me and
I will see you very shortly in a new
blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
