channel today's video is going to be my
highly highly highly highly requested
skincare routine I haven't done a
voiceover in the longest time so I'm
gonna have to try and speed through this
I am gonna pray warn you I pretty much
use every single thing from Clinique
clinic is the most incredible skincare
brand it's super gentle super soft
however if you guys have been following
me for the last few months you would
know that I have been breaking out on my
forehead and on my cheek I went off the
pill and so I've been trying to find a
solution to combating really blemished
skin and I really feel like I've hit the
nail on the head I always always always
start off with my clinic take the day
off mom I've been using this for years
you guys know it was in my last can care
routine as well I love this because you
don't need to use heaps of makeup wipes
to get your makeup off this essentially
just melts all the makeup off your skin
today I wasn't wearing any makeup to
begin with because I knew I was sitting
down to fill my skincare routine for you
guys I still do it regardless every
single night before I go to bed
it just takes off any dirt any makeup
any excess oils or anything that is on
your skin really melts that away and
gives you a fresh face to work with when
you do go in to use your cleanser
otherwise if you go straight into using
your cleanser without using this step I
feel that it doesn't give my face a
really really thorough wash I just love
how gentle it is for the last three or
four months I've been using my anti
blemish solution cleanser but I've
actually just run out of that so I'm now
testing out this clinic liquid facial
soap in mild which I'm really really
enjoying I feel like it does a very
similar thing it just makes my skin feel
so clean so I just do this and I just
massage this around my face for a little
bit both of them work amazingly I've
used the anti blemish solution one a
little longer so I probably would
recommend that one just as much but so
far I've had no problems with this
liquid facial soap as well it's super
gentle and all clinic is allergy tested
so I haven't had any any irritation from
that whatsoever
I don't always exfoliate but maybe three
times a week
I will take my hep start which is a -
it's sort of a turn one cleanser and
this stuff is magic on those days that
I'm feeling extra congested
and a lot of pimples are appearing and
I'm feeling a lot of oils come through
my skin I will take this guy and just
really massage it into my skin this
stuff is incredible because it obviously
dissolves any of the extra dirt that
might be left on your skin but I can
really really feel it exfoliating any
dead skin cells off my skin the papaya
ingredient in this stuff is incredible
because it's basically just like an
enzyme and it just makes you glow which
I love and it's good cuz it's not too
rough on the a lot of exfoliators really
irritate my skin this one is nice and
gentle which is fabulous and I thought I
would show you guys the masks that I use
as well I use these clearing masks right
now it's really weird for me because I
used to use all masks that were for just
making my skin glow and we're really
luminizing ones and we're for you know
making your skin soft and moisturized
and these days my skin has completely
flipped and I've been using all the
clearing masks I've got my Clinique anti
blemish solution mask and I've got my
glam glow clearing mud so I take both of
these and I don't really put them all
over my face I'll generally just put a
small portion on the spots that I feel
need at the clearing so the problem
areas of my skin I feel like if I put it
all over my face it really really dries
my skin out so I don't like to put it I
don't like to lather it everywhere and
this will just do some extra drying up
of both pimples so I leave that on for
about 10 to 15 minutes so this is back
to my every day skincare routine this is
one of the steps that I do every single
day after I cleanse and it is the anti
blemish solution clarifying lotion and
no matter how hard I cleanse my skin
with all of my products you will always
find when you put a little bit of this
on a cotton pad and just wipe it all
over your face there will always be a
little bit of excess dirt on your skin
so I think it's really important to do
this and toners people are scared of
toners because they think that alcohol
in toners are really bad for you and it
really dries up your skin it's not at
all it's not irritating it at all it
just really gets rid of those extra oils
before we apply our moisturizer now this
comes as no surprise the moisturizer I
use I don't feel like I need to talk
about this anymore I've talked about
this in every single on my videos it's
my favorite moisturizer and that is
Moisture Surge I've gone through that
many bottles of this stuff it's
ridiculous but the difference is now for
my nighttime routine anyway is that I
actually mix it with my anti blemish
solution a little mini like sort of
pimple cream so I'd basically take a big
scoop of my moisturizer and I'd then put
a little bit of this pimple cream
throughout it mix it together and I
actually put that all over my face and
at first I was like oh this could be a
bad idea it might dry up my skin really
badly but it works like a dream it has
done such a good job I just really
really keeping my skin super clear and
not letting those pimples spread and not
letting the oil spread and it's again
it's a super gentle products although it
does a great job at combating pimples
it's not too harsh on the skin I do love
to just give my face a big spritz of
moisture and this is the origins ginseng
facial spray I use any facial spray
really but I'll do a big spritz of that
just to hydrate my skin and then if I
have any problem areas like you can see
here I'll just put a bit of extra pimple
cream just over those areas at the end
of this video I just wanted to show you
guys as well the foundation I use on an
everyday basis that helps me not to
break out that isn't a really heavy
thick foundation it's perfect for winter
it's perfect for summer it's just the
best everyday foundation that I own and
it is the Clinique even better glow the
reason I love this is because it's super
lightweight but gives you amazing
coverage still and actually within the
foundation there are skin care
properties which is my favorite part of
it so you know that while it's on your
skin it's still doing a good job at
combating pimples and giving you those
skincare benefits that actual skin care
gives you so I just wanted to include
that in this video as well for you guys
just as an option if you find
foundations are really clogging up your
pores and really giving you a lot of
pimples maybe try out this foundation
and see how it goes here because it's
definitely done wonders for my skin as
well it's a good one as well if you just
want to like for me in winter as you can
see in this video my skin goes so white
on my face and I don't like to keep my
face in the Sun too much so it's good at
just evening out my skin tone and just
keeping letting it match my body so I
don't look like a white sick ghost
anyways I hope that you guys have
enjoyed this video let me know if you
have any questions I'd be happy to
answer them down below obviously this
video is so short so I feel like I can't
say that much thank you for watching and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
