start my videos it's always like holler
or Alex that's never how I ever say
actually now I do say hello like that
people today's video is so exciting
because it is I don't even know if I'm
spoken about it on my youtube channel
but it is a sort of challenge video was
I'm in Mecca land now I don't know
whether you guys have seen the campaign
I might insert something here
and that was what we shot a little while
back in history on Sydney we had so much
fun I love the girls it's such a good
group of girls and yeah we're all going
to be attending as like the Buddhist
Squad to Mecca land which will be in
Melbourne pretty sure all the tickets
have been and gone like I'm pretty sure
they sold out in like an hour or
something crazy the whole squad Shawnee
Bella Heidi and myself are going to be
doing a challenge with all the limited
edition products that are going to be at
McHale and so literally the biggest box
here it's all the products that yeah a
limited edition to Mechelen itself so if
you're coming to methyl and get excited
because there's literally so many new
products that are literally limited
edition to this like little beauty
festival not gonna lie you guys I'm a
little bit intimidated to be doing a
challenge video with Bella Heidi and
Shani
best tutorials I we all know how like I
know you guys I know we're friends but
like we all know that I'm not the best
eye makeup although I love doing makeup
I'm probably helped the best at makeup
so it's a little intimidating to be
doing a challenge this is those girls
but you know we're gonna give it our
best shot and that's all that matters
right right you're so right so what I'm
gonna do is do my face off camera just
like my foundation and then we'll get
into the juicy festival makeup look so
if you guys love me and you want to vote
for me um you can go onto the mecca land
site I'll leave all the details for this
down below basically you and four
friends get a chance to come to Mecca
land like win tickets to come to Mecca
land you get for domestic return flights
to Melbourne so if you're interstate you
can still fly with four of your friends
well there's four of you and you get to
meet me so if that's an incentive that'd
be great but basically yeah your win
four tickets winner for flight and get
to stay a night at the cutie in
Melbourne and you'll get to give me a
cuddle so literally all you have to do
is go on to the mecca be junky YouTube
channel they've got a YouTube channel
which I've actually got a few tutorials
up there as well so you can go check
those out but you'd have to subscribe to
that channel and find my festival look
and go and comment on it all you need to
do is leave a comment leave your
Instagram handle in the comment tell us
why you love me but no I like I think
you literally just have to leave your
name and your Instagram handle so that
if you do win Mecca can contact you yeah
you can also tell them why you love me I
mean that would be kind of cool too but
anyways let's get on to the bit do a
month I am also so stoked because I got
sent all of these new brushes which are
from Mecca cos medica and Mecca max
which make a Maxima has come out with
their brand Mecca Max and I love brushes
I never clean my brushes so I love
getting new ones so laziest lazy girl
thing ever
to say but I love new brushes so I'm
keen to try these out so if you guys are
wondering what brushes I'm using it'll
be or either map across America which
are the gold ones or the meta max ones a
black see what we're working with
la la la la how cool is this Mecca
cosmetic a calligraphy one it looks like
a paint brush so I've just put my hair
up and done my base but I thought I
would show you guys a few of the little
things that we've got so in your dreams
cosmetic glitter and this stuff looks
beautiful we've got some gold glitter
some pink glitter some purple blue it
looks like holographic like purple and
blue and green the Stila glitter and
glow the quit eyeshadow and these are
absolutely everywhere everyone's
obsessed about ladies night that's
that's what these I think this is
limited edition I think the vibe I'm
getting is that I'm gonna be doing a
holographic look you know when the hair
comes up things are getting serious in
my kit was this bask in complete
coverage concealer I'm gonna try this
out looks a little dark but we'll say
add some coverage under these eyes a
little bit down the center oh the
applicator is beautiful when applicators
don't give you much product with this
like just dispenses so much product I
love it I'm just gonna skim through this
part because we all want to see the
Polito don't we I never wear glue I'm
nervous okay so because I've done my
face I'm just going to start on my eyes
business limited edition and Nas palette
it's called the nas wanted eyes shadow
palette and oh god is that they've given
me almost too much choice for
holographic stuff I'm like what am I
like I want to use all of that I don't
know I don't know which one to use
this guy I'm gonna use this as a
transition we always need that
transition it's got the perfect amount
of neutral transition shades and then
just like some really cool funky shades
it's that I'm jumping into this one here
and I'm just gonna Deacon that up
really nice and pigmented now I'm going
to go into the Doc Brown and I'm just
going to put this on the outer corner
and just deepen that up
okay so now I want to take this one I
love you look at this one
gorgeous I reckon I'm going to be
covered in glitter for the next like
yeah after this tutorial and you know
what I'm not mad about it
and I'm just going back into this brown
and just blending that out
I want to take this gold and just put it
on my inner tear ducts that looks
iridescent as well it looks like it's
got like a pink reflect I want to put
that like a little on my lower I'm gonna
pick up the green and put that on my
lash line you don't even need to wet
this this palette you guys see how
gorgeous that is just taking the brown
again I'm gonna smudge that out I wonder
if any of us would do the same thing
like think of the same thing I'm sure
some of us will or a few of us will have
something very similar could you imagine
if we all did exactly the same thing
that would be so funny great minds think
alike
alright so that's what we got ah I
actually kind of love it I love it a lot
I'm gonna use the mecha Maxx hollow
jelly in super moon they have katroo
shades one is like this white area
doesn't blue which I mean would go
perfectly today but this one it looks
stunning it's a little bit more Goldie
and I mean you use that as my just cream
highlighted like we're gonna all over my
face that's what whoa whoa look at that
it's literally jelly and it feels like
putty Wow
I'm just adding that oh no I jacked up
my eyeshadow down my nose now we've got
that pinky tinge in the crease I'm
putting in a blush on as well sort of to
tie the blues and the greens old
together bareMinerals blush it's in
peachy cane and I'm pretty sure this is
limited edition as well so that's what
that looks like
I feel like that'll look really pretty
with the blue now I'm kind of waiting
out here but I'm gonna use this glitter
eyeliner by a buttock it'll use this
glitter eyeliner by urban decay and we
use that kind of like in a triangle
under my eyes and I'm gonna try and
stick these jewels on with back so I
don't actually have glitter glue oh oh
oh yes no way oh my god absolutely
even this holographic like that looks
white in here but it comes on green
glitter eyeliner
do I put it on top as well do i dad I'm
gonna do the gold glitter on top
actually this one's a much more finely
milled glitter and I'm gonna put that on
the top oh my god my whole apartment
he's absolutely screwed just off the
center I'm going to try it first
this is literally the prettiest thing I
have ever seen this glitter is a jug Wow
I'm kind of just cool with just the eyes
who created this glitter is genius in
coming to add some of this icy white one
on to my collarbones just see how that
looks
yeah it's like snowflakes this is so
cool I'm gonna take this Urban Decay
heavy metal glitter eyeliner and this is
in the shade sticks and bones and I'm
just gonna draw above my eyebrows little
dots wow this could be an absolute epic
fail and I'm just taking the blue one
again so that it's not so intense like
the one under the eye
um and yeah and then I'm really just
desperate to try out these Naz liquid
lipsticks and so I know you guys gonna
be like you boring biatch but I might
just go with nude just cuz the makeup is
