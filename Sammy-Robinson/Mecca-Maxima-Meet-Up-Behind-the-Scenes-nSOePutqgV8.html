attire it's a very rainy all day today
I'm just doing a face mask from Grand
where to prep my skin I literally feel
like I'm going on a first date with you
guys I might choose my outfit and I have
like no idea what to wear because it is
so cold I kind of had shorts and a
singlet in mind and now I don't really
know and I don't really know what I'm
gonna wear but I figure it out I think
maybe just dreams and I sing books I'll
still probably get hot and for two it's
not a clock now and I have to leave at
about 11:00 so good two hours to get
ready I'm joking cause of it it's time
wearing my hair slicked as always and
just kind of normal makeup we should put
the KMA ignition um
now so let's go I'm actually weirdly not
nervous at all
I was pretty nervous last night I was
kind of try to think about fit and I
couldn't think of anything I just want a
really simple out there because it's
what I always wear and I just didn't
want to wear something different and not
like it or feel uncomfortable it's I
reckon it's going to be so much fun
today I'm actually so excited and I'm
very lucky that I get to do it with Tina
and Bella the food I would be not much
more nervous if I had to do it alone
so I'm so grateful but there
gonna be the results Oh kill me my soul
I don't think
are you guys nervous me excited
hi
Rosaria
Oh
and I know shelving system a usable
pillowy against mystifying the word
literally means were both beautiful
no heavy Sesame nearly full of them
Carnell I am a mess guys if you guys saw
me there thank you so much for coming
I'm putting my glasses on I feel like a
mess
no words Oh
so I'm back at home now I'm so exhausted
but in the best way possible I've been
smiling for hours my face is like oh but
so many of you guys turned up I can't
believe how many of you go cave so it's
just like the best experience ever
because obviously like I've said to you
guys before I've met you guys here and
there all over the place like all the
time I met you guys but I've never
really got gotten to meet you guys in a
big group or lots of you at a time so I
was insane that is really insane thank
you so much for the girls that came if
you're watching this I love you so much
I hope you guys enjoyed it as well I
knew we didn't really have time to speak
to many of you for too long because sort
of we had to rush on through and say
hello to as many people as we could but
it was really lovely to meet you guys
and I hope that I get to do lots more
meetups in the future in lots of
different other places so that I can
meet lots more of you yeah so I got this
incredible ring from one of you guys
I'll leave the details in the
description box if you guys want to
check her out it's um she came I think
she said she came from South Australia
I remember where she said she was from
but um it's her mother's jewelry line
and it's just gorgeous I wanted a ring
on this finger for so long
so it's perfect I love it
but yes um otherwise it's a really
gloomy day outside still which was kind
of perfect because I got so hot I got
sort of sweaty I felt so bad for all the
girls are hugging me I was like I'm so
sorry and literally like a sweaty mess
right now I'm not really sure how I'm
going to be doing this vlog because I
know I want to include this vlog with a
lot of other vlog footage I took when I
was in LA so I think now I'm going to
sort of rewind back to LA which was last
November and I'm just going to show you
guys a whole bunch of footage from when
we were in the Smashbox Studios in
filmed our Smashbox tutorial and then
also took all the photos so the photos
in the
pain that it that are all over the mecca
windows I have some behind-the-scenes
footage of all of that so I thought I
wanted to include that into this vlog as
well so it probably be a pretty pretty
long vlog because there's lots of things
going on but um yeah I just wanted to
show you guys I was well because it was
such an incredible experience going to
Smashbox Studios and shooting with Davis
factor I've shot with him before and
he's just the coolest guy ever
so yeah I think I'll put some music over
the top of this and show you guys just
like a little bit of behind the scenes
of that and then as well as that I'm
going to be uploading my Smashbox
tutorial soon so the actual tutorial
that we filmed ages ago in November over
in LA in mesh Studios which was so much
fun was probably the first time I filmed
for someone else on their cameras it was
pretty nerve-wracking filming in front
of other people watching them like
watching me face with the camera but
after that so many different times now
and I love doing it but um yeah it was
the first time I filmed for anyone else
in their studios and yeah I love how the
videos hand out sort of a dark or to me
inspired makeup look because it was
autumn and sort of fall when we were
over there it was kind of cool ish or
current the way I think I feel because
they were either in autumn or we're
about to be in autumn when you say this
I don't even remember I think it was
just couldn't scold when we were over
there but but yes I mean upload that for
you guys probably next week and you can
see my smashbox always on liquid
lipstick that i chose so I don't know I
feel like I haven't said this either but
in store if you go into Mecca Maxima
you'll see a Smashbox always on liquid
lipstick under sort of my little panel
and it has my own packaging on it so
it's called True Grit
the shade and this is it so this is my
packaging and that's the color it's a
really beautiful dark dark chocolate
brown I work today at the meet up so
that was what was on my lips and we got
to design our own packaging for the box
so mine's all gold and then it has my
name written on it
I'm going to say bye now because I'm
going to end the video with just a whole
bunch of behind the scenes stuff with
music so that you guys can enjoy love
you guys I'll see
my next video
so I Randy Smashbox always on the public
speaking
Oh
