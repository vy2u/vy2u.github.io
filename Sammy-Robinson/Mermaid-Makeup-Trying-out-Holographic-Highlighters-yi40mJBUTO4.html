weird is this I sort of had a big
nostalgia this setting and I thought I
would just put my camera on here slip it
around and in them so another video here
I thought it was a perfect background
because today's video as you can tell by
the title is going to be and they're
made holographic look I thought it'd be
nice to have lots of color in the
background and make it look really fresh
the video is in coverage from a sports
car that sent me their new highlighters
and holographic lip to try out in this
video so selling out I may be trying
this Marc Jacobs invisible undercover
perfecting coconut face primer I have
seen this all over the internet everyone
reads like this and I just got my hands
on it so I'm just going to use this as
my first primer all that feels really
nice I chose a lot of these products
because they resemble mermaid vibe so
coconut if you can't tell let me do
another primer and if I'm objective as
well this one is the jus you to drop and
I appreciate only supposed to use this
on like the high points of your face but
I'm sort of going to put it all over my
face oh my gosh yes if you can hear
snoring in the background that would be
get it okay so you guys are gonna think
I'm crazy so it's a foundation I chose
rainforest of the sea I had to so I'm
just going to put a light layer of this
all over my face I don't want anything
too full coverage because I want to be
looking as fresh as possible
and then you can feel I'm going to be
taking my top shape tapes I have at the
color medium and light medium honey
medium is just not lie enough not
brightening enough so I just add a
little bit of light one as well I'm
looking into a severely severely zoomed
in mirror and it's really confronting I
take whatever is excess from sponge and
I kind of just put it on there center
points of my face as well and then the
last cream product I'm going to be using
before we set our face is going to be
this clinic chubby stick in the shade
apple this is just a really beautiful
baby pink shade I want to be a flushing
mermaid I'm picking my sister up from
school today and I'm really happy gonna
have to get out the car because I'm
going to literally be clothing but not
just any glow it's going to be like
holographic crazy blue silver pink
purple so just to set the under eyes I'm
going to be taking my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and that's kind of
the only spot I'm really going to
properly set down I want to keep the
rest of the face pretty Joey just be
careful being sample so now to Brunn's
up the scale a little bit I'm going to
be taking the Too Faced sweetheart
bronzer which is a shimmery bronzer take
a big angle brush and just really warm
up the outer perimeter of my face you
don't have to be too strategic with the
placement of your bronzer to run it down
my nose to other immediate now
I'm going to quickly brush my brows
through and just lightly fill them in
I'm using my benefit precisely my brow
pencil because my favorite brow pencil
at the moment kind of hard to make a
mistake which really helps people like
me that aren't so good at filling in
their brows I've been really liking just
adding that little extra definition I
thought my eyebrows died which made them
really dark but it just adds like
really shaped the face okay so on to the
fun stuff I'll show you guys that I've
got so I've got the on the glow net
mermaid and pelvis oh my god if you
already see look at that the packaging
in itself is kidding so this one is just
like a rainbow and I kind of just swirl
them together
last but certainly not least we've got
our pout about it lipstick I'll show you
what this looks like with and without a
lipstick so this one is gold reflex this
one has a purple reflex you can probably
tell as I move it so I could do the
purple and this one has a bit of a blue
reflex and then that one straight blue
purple reflex oh my gosh you guys see
that that is awesome
try this one this is the blue one so
that's what it looks like it's just the
base and this is the holographic so cool
so and then that start lathering you're
like me now I mean I mixture of the two
light ones down my nose so pretty it's a
purple the I'm going to put the gold
it's kind of got all of it all over but
gold up here
god what have I done
Oh God
farewell I remember because I'm going to
go for the blue one now add the purple
and the blue it's usually fun let's take
a little bit of the gold on my finger my
face I'm like it's like a rainbow glow
on a brush and I'm gonna go skinny I
mean this is a blush I could completely
screw up my whole look here but oh it's
kind of purple because I mix them all
together can you see that it made that
purple color
that's that well that's really pretty
the bad boys yellow and the orange to my
brow bone
oh yeah I'm gonna take the pink and the
orange from the top I'm gonna tear ducts
I like that the blue and the green right
a little a shine all that it's so clean
there's like sparkles in it okay
how about it lipsticks I'm going to show
you guys with this website without a
lipstick little pink reflex in it so as
I move you can see the little pink
reflux this is just one of the nudes
from sports girl this is the part about
it in Wonderland just a really nice a
wearable nude is oh by the way this is
called unicorn enough you guys are
picking yourself on camera but I am
Tamilian real-life it just almost makes
it a gloss like it gives it a really
beautiful Sheen like as I'm moving in
the light you can see a little pink
reflex the life is going down outside as
you can tell it going darker and darker
in here so perfect timing because I'm
finished the makeup look so I am
completely obsessed with those
highlighters I think just as you move
you can just see I can't stop just like
switching directions and looking at it
in our better stop I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video I will make sure to
leave all the links for everything down
below if you guys want to pick anything
that I've used in this video up and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
