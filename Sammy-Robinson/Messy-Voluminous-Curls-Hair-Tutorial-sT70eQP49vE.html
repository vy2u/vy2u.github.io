today I'm doing a hair curling routine
using the cloud 9 hair color it's a
really good plural because it's actually
tapered so you can have a thinner curl
or you can have a thicker curl so to
begin the process I'm sectioning off my
hair into two parts and just clipping it
back so I'm taking my cloud9 hair brush
which is the most amazing hairbrush I'm
obsessed it and I'm just brushing
through my hair just so that there's no
nuts and it's easy to section off the
parts and then I'm gonna section off my
hair into quite thick sections because I
don't want the girls to be tooling
liddie so basically I don't have a
specific way I curl like the direction I
colored in I'm more just like to start
sort of an inch down from my scalp and
then I leave the bottom part out as well
to leave sort of a straight bottom just
because I think it gives it a more
beachy look and it just puts a nice bend
in the in the hair instead of having
full-on ringlets from the very top to
the very bottom so yeah you can curl in
different directions you can curl
forwards you can go backwards but for me
after I finish sort of killing the whole
head I really it all out and I switched
the direction that
is going anyway so it doesn't matter too
much for me but yes
so then I'm taking my evo builders
paradise working at hairspray it is the
most strong holding hairspray I've ever
used that I know just spraying that all
through the curls and just sort of
scratching up making sure that they stay
nice and tight like all the rest of my
hair so that I'm just gonna go on to the
other side and I'll speed up its process
but I just basically feel exactly the
same living an interview top and from
the bottom and then I'll just take my
hair spray again and set those curls if
you guys are looking for a good
hairspray this one is amazing they say
it's like a council of hair clay but
it's you can't feel it like it's not
horribly sticky in hair or anything it's
amazing so yeah I'm just then tying my
hair back and working on the top section
now
so the reason I like to keep my hair in
the middle part is because I curled the
hair all in one direction and then
usually what I do is I actually flip my
hair over at the end and I give myself a
side part so the direction that I curl
my hair doesn't matter as much when I'm
doing it in the middle part because I
know that the direction of the curl will
change when I flip it over so basically
just the whole process is exactly the
same if you just leave the top section
and the bottom section and just put a
slight bend in your hair you can hold it
loosely or you can hold it tight
depending on how what you type how
tightly you want yokel to be but for me
my hair does fall out so of the curls so
I like to make sure it's pretty a pretty
tight curl
I know it looks so weird now but don't
worry once we brush it out its it's
gonna look normal
so I'm just gonna speed through this
section and then yes so we'll just brush
the color afterwards I couldn't stop
laughing at myself
cheering this section because it just
looks so weird once you take all your
hair out it just looks so strange
so then of course take your hairbrush
and brush all the curls out
so I'm then taking my evo mr. fantastic
texture spray and I'm just spraying that
sort of on the middle part then flippin
each section over and spraying it on the
other side as well just to make sure I
get heaps of volume up in the roots
because we didn't curl the roots so it's
a little bit flat so as you can see it
just pushes up the hair and gives you
lots of texture and volume and then I
make sure that I sort of keep brushing
it and playing with it until I like it
and I see where it sits properly on me I
like to make sure that the curls are
still pretty intense straightaway as you
can see that they're still pretty
intense but I know that my hair drops
throughout the night so I like to make
sure it's nice and curly when I live and
yeah so that's it that's the end I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
