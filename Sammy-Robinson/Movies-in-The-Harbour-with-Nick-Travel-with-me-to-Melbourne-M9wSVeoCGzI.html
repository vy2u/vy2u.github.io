Centennial Park and we're going with
Audi Australia so I think we're seeing
gold it's with Matthew McConaughey's
about gold mines or something I'm
actually sure but we're going early
because how many of those drinks and
kind of pays and stuff I don't even know

camera along and bring you guys with me
and show you guys what we got too
because I think it's going to be really
beautiful I my own scarf in case it gets
cold I want to fishing in a freezing
cold state I don't enjoy the movie so
much so as my blanket on a scale of 1 to
10 how excited are you
110 Oh a lot of boy so everyone says
they want you more in my vlogs how do
you feel about that to be camera shy
Todd games on the camera maybe if you
read your comment he'll come in more
so the number one most intriguing things
to me when I watch logs because I love
watching people vlog in public this is
interesting I can do a lot of people
walking around so I'm going to try and
do that smelling a giant log in public

Centennial Park and it's so beautiful

rest of the nine put some music over it

school faculty photographer she didn't
happen what animal relation of
intelligence along and I confessed about
the day that was also want to be able

poetry and the notion of cabinetry and I
contrast and just with a cargo really
trying to get away we'll have another
woman on the side whether there was a
linear Kingdom with a nickel one day so
