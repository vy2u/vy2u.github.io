soak much coconut milk infusion it's
just sort of a bath salt so I'll be
putting this in the bath with me and
sort of in between trying skincare
products but I've been trying this for
the last few days and I am actually
obsessed it's completely transformed my
skin so I'm going to be washing my face
with this cucumber wash I'm going to be
after my bath putting on this truth
serum which is a combined C serum I got
this stuff in my Sephora showcase bag
the other day and I just thought it
sounded really amazing in berliner kale
and spinach face mask so I'm going to be
putting this on while I'm in the bath
gonna be putting this hair treatment in
my hair my husband really dry the last
few days and I haven't been taken care
of my hair on my skin or my body or
anything so I put this through my hair
while I'm in the bath I am so hot right
now
it smells like kale
got my hair treatment in and yes I'm
truly one of those people now I have
kale and spinach on my face this
Marshall bath salt feels incredible on
my skin but now I'm going to be putting
a little bit of Trent body at body scrub
all over my body this is a godsend in
winter it's awful to do and linked
because it's really cold and it was kind
of the shower and kind of let it dry but
it's amazing because it just gives you a
body so much moisture and then sort of
scrapes away any of the dead skin and
dryness that might be on your body good

bed because I just changed my sheets
I've just been doing a little bit of
cleaning around so I had so many clothes
