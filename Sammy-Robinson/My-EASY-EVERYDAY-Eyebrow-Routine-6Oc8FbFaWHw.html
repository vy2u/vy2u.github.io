today's video is my eyebrow routine I
went up on my YouTube and realized the
last eyebrow routine was so long ago and
it was very different I do my brows very
very differently now so I thought I
would give you guys an update eyebrow
routine I know so many of my viewers are
like 15 16 as long so I'm going to try
and keep this view as short as I
possibly can and then benefit has
contacted me asking that whether I want
to do a video with them and you guys
know I already use my benefit products
for my eyebrows and I have for so long
so I was like hell yes I've been really
trying to slow down on doing
sponsorships recently I've actually said
no - you wouldn't believe me I'm said no
- but when benefit asked I was like yeah
all of you guys probably agree how
friggin awesome benefit is they are the
best so yes I will link everything that
you guys need to know down below and
let's jump into it just start by saying
I took my thing took my nails off and I
feel like a little boy if you guys have
been watching me for a while you know
I'm a precisely my brow kind of gal this
is the pencil that I've been using for
the longest time and I've literally just
run out of this one so see you later
this is my new I'm a fresh pencil which
is awesome I love the pencil cause it is
for me the most natural effect and it
does it the quickest you guys would like
the really brushed up natural bushy
looked and that's you've come to the
right video because that's what I do
pretty much every day I take the spoolie
end of my precisely my brow eyebrow
pencil and I just begin by brushing all
of my hair boys I love just a really
natural bushy brow look that's my
absolute favorite so I begin magically
seeing you in huh i begin at the front
of my brow and I basically just draw in
the bottom line of the brow first
I'm using the lightest hand as well
although the end of the brow oh I'm
going to be saying brow a lot in this
video I know I noticed last time I
filmed this video that I did that as
well so I'm really sorry
let's just play a drinking game every
time I say brow take a shot so once I
have sort of lightly feathered in the
bottom part of the eyebrow take the
spoolie again this fully comes so in
handy for me I pretty much miss bullies
basically everything for me every time I
do anything I kind of brush it through
again and make sure it's really diffused
then I'm going to take the brush and
basically just flick in product
throughout my brows so I kind of just
any spots areas just go upwards up
against the hairs
making sort of hair like strokes this
one's very similar to just want to
except it's a little darker and just a
little fuller I'm going to do the same
on the other side now I'm just going to
fill in the bottom part and I take my
spoolie just make sure there's no harsh
lines then I create the brush like
strokes
I just continue to successfully pretty
much just brush everything out so that's
all I do with the pencil it's really
simple it probably takes me about two
minutes every day to fill in my eyebrows
and now go in with my gimme brow so one
is empty again so I go in with the shade
number three doing brow by benefit if
you guys remember a while back I was
every single video using the Ready Set
brow by benefit the clear brow gel which
was like it locked your plate yeah I was
in like glue it was the most insane
eyebrow setting gelid ever used like I
said in my last makeup tutorial I feel
like my eyebrows have been getting a lot
lighter as I get older I tip them
occasionally and I've been growing them
out if you guys think that they look
kind of gross and unkempt it's because
I'm purposefully trying to grow them out
I've started to use the tinted brow gel
and I pretty much just brush all my
hairs upwards
we're using this pretty much just makes
using a pencil a lot easier as well
because I don't have to go in and fill
in every single gap could this also
provides so much color since that is
pretty much all I do for my brows brows
brows what else could you call them like
I see there's nothing else I can say
brows Brad Brad Brad thank you so much
to benefit for working with me on this
videos thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video anyone ever feel this on my hand
I've got such large hands I feel like
this small now because of my nails era
what we're have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
