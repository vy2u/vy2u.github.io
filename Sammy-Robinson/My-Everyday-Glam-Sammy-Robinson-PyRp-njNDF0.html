with my boyfriend and all I'm doing is
the same exact look that I do all the
times they'll look for my favorites
video it's just the big lashes and the
bold lip but a pretty interesting actual
skin but a few of you guys asked so I
thought maybe I'll film it and just do a
bit of a chitchat get ready with me
so I've already moisturized on my skin
hair and everything like that they take
my fresh fresh face instant glow
Luminizer and use that as my prime own
I'm going to mix it with my NYX born to
glow liquid illuminator just to give a
bit more of a bronzey look to the skin
now I'm going to be taking my hourglass
stick foundation in the shade a warm
beige I've used this like once and I
don't know if I liked it but I'm just
going to try it again just because why
not just to mix up that make it a little
different on my channel umm I don't know
how much I'm supposed to use a bit
that's probably a lot isn't it I'm going
to take my zoeva defined buffer brush
and just buff that into my skin
I like really lightweight foundation so
I don't know when I'm gonna like this
but when I'm going out I don't mind as
much using a bit more of a heavy
foundation because it's not really day
to have them it's more nighttime glance
oh it's okay getting one with bigger
foundation go get into the habit of
putting stuff away when I use it
otherwise my desk becomes a pigsty this
is another really thick product but um I
used to use this all the time this is
the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
yeah like I said it's very thick product
but I want to use some different
products on my channel not just use the
same stuff all the time so I remember
loving this but I didn't like how thick
it was so we'll say I spread it out it
should be okay
it's in the shade medium so let's see
how that goes I'm just going to take a
damp Beauty blender and blend that into
my skin so next I'm going to take this
smashbox step-by-step contour stick in
the shade contour and i'm just going to
contour my face and try my nose comedy
bears but it's fun fun to try anyway so
i'm taking the same brush that I used
with my foundation and i'm just going to
buff that into my skin whoa that blends
out like a dream
I can't punt on my nose I always try I
more like to just put um gruntal they're
not because I want to change your shape
of windows but just bring the dimension
back into my face and you guys know it
I'm taking my Josie Maran Argan and
illuminating in illuminating wand and
I'm gonna begin to highlight with that I
am i will be using a powder as well
actually I'll use my stealer one to show
you guys how that looks cuz I that was
in my favorites video as well taking my
Laura Mercier translucent loose powder
and the damn Beauty Blender and I'm
going to back my under eyes because this
concealer is so a heavy duty you want to
make sure to set that down especially if
you're having a night out and I am it's
currently 159 so 2 p.m. and we're going
out at three so if I'm going to be
staying out all night I'm also going to
set up the sides of my nose cuz that
will slow down the nose and I'll
probably set um the whole of center
portion of my face gosh my back really
hurts every time I go reach a product it
like clicks ah alright I'm going to take
my ambient lighting powder from our bus
in dim light and set the rest of my face
I'm going to use my Charlotte Tilbury
set the timer name on the back again I
don't know what the set is called but
I'm going to take the e bronze up
so we're just going to Manly a beach in
Sydney for drinks tonight
it's Saturday night so it'll probably be
pretty busy down there I don't often go
to Manly for drinks but um it's actually
a really nice place I love going to
Manly all right and I'm just going to
take that bronzer on the apples of my
cheeks as well just because I don't want
to use a blush so just add some color
back into the cheeks with the bronzer
now I'll show you guys the radial
contour as well this is good this doing
a makeup tutorial after the favourites
video is good second out with a shmatte
good though because I can show you on
where I was going to go really red yes
so you take literally the tiniest map
because it is so pigmented
and then you can just run whatever is
left over on the brush down your nose
again I'm going to take the stealer star
light star bright palette and of course
take these two shades here store the
grape subtle highlight like I said it's
um not glittery or intense it's very
finely milled so you won't be able to
necessarily notice it too much it should
just like melt into your skin so now for
eyebrows I'm going to take my Diorshow
brows Tyler brow pencil I'm going to
begin by just brushing my eyebrows up
again in the day I never feel in my
eyebrows but when I'm going out I like
to just add a bit of definition
underneath the this part of my brows and
then maybe like a little bit on the tail
just to dig Nate up a little bit I've
noticed what I've been editing a lot of
my makeup tutorials recently that I keep
my mouth open whenever I'm doing a
shadow or mascara or eyebrows and it's
so infuriating to watch because the
whole time I'm literally just like I'm
about to drool so I just like to define
the arch a little bit understand the
Front's of the browsers nothing too
intense got it like you can tell that
this is a good brow good brow setting
gel fits my cot it even sets the lid to
the bottle it's like glue if you just
take your Beauty Blender at the end and
just sort of push everything into your
skin I'm going to take my Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray
oh my god that one my eyes that will
just further um
melt the powders into your skin as well
now so I'm going to take my Laura Geller
highlighter I could just take the Stila
one but I really love how gold this one
is and I'm going to put it directly on
my inner tear ducts and to really open
the eyes up what I love doing is taking
a bit of the highlighter and putting on
my lower lash line and I don't put any
mascara on my lower lash line because I
think it really makes my eyes look super
droopy so now for mascara I'm gonna take
my clinic chubby lash mascara this one
is amazing as well you guys know my
favorite is the Stila one but this one
is almost on par I love this as well and
these are the eyelashes I had on in my
favorites video and a lot of you guys
asked me I just found a random eyelash
in my bathroom and I just cut it in half
so it originally was an eyelash like
that and I was chopped in half and I'm
putting it on either sides of my eyes
okay so that's the lashes on that in
case you guys are wondering as well what
I use when I do my eyelashes I use
jewelr just the white one and then I
always use tweezers to put them on and
then I'll use an eyelash curler to clamp
them together with my natural ones just
really lightly just so that they are
stuck more firmly
if you ever struggle getting fake
eyelashes off you just have a shower and
run your face under some steam and the
global ilysm so that's the eyes done so
now for the lipstick I'm going to start
by lining my lips so I'm going to take
my NYX suede matte lip liner in the
aid oh I'm going to take my NYX lip
liner in the shade suede I think
and then I'm going to take my Smashbox
always on that liquid lipstick in
stepping out so that's the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed it I know that
it's nothing new but I thought I would
show you the makeup that I do when I go
out I just thought I would do it because
there was a few of you asking me to do
it from my favorites video so I thought
I would give you my everyday makeup
tutorial which um I can link down below
if you guys interested and then this is
my glam every day tutorial for when I
have an event to go to or I'm going out
at night or something so I hope you guys
have enjoyed it if you did I'd love it
if you give me a thumbs up and subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
