you so much for watching today I'm doing
my eyebrow routine so if you're
interested in seeing how I fill in my
eyebrows please keep watching so for my
eyebrows I usually switch up between two
products so if I'm going for a stronger
brow I'll go from my Anastasio that
beverly hills dipbrow or alternatively
if i'm going for a softer brow and i
just want to take a really short amount
of time on my brows I will go in with my
Mac eyebrow crayon in the shade
lingering it just takes a shorter amount
of time for me and it just softly fills
in my brows but today I'm going to go in
with my anastasia dipbrow in blond so to
begin the brows I always run a light
layer of clear brow gel through them
just pointing the hairs upwards so
that's easier to fill in the bottom part
of the brow so I'm going in with my
Ardell brow sculpting gel in clear and
I'm just going to brush my hair upwards
so to fill in my brows I'll use a angled
brush make sure it's always clean
because it's much more precise and the
bristles are much more tightly compact
when the brush is clean so I lightly
coated my angled brush in the anastasia
dipbrow pomade and now I'm going in at
an angle that is flat towards my face I
don't go in like that because that's
when it can be dragged down and make a
mess all over your brow I'm going in at
a flat angle and I really lightly in
feathering motions start at the head of
the brow and I'm just going to create
the line of well the reason I use
feathering motions is so that I can
mimic the hairs on my brows instead of
going in with a pure line and it's
obvious that's drawn on when you feather
it it just looks like you're creating
more hairs on your brows so once I've
created that line on the bottom portion
of the brow I take I turned the brush
upwards so it's long ways and I begin to
feather in the product into the brow
just filling in any sparse areas and
just meeting up this line underneath my
brow so you're going in with as light
strokes as possible and with as little
crack as possible
but you can build it up as you go so I
run that through the end and then I
extend it out a little bit like so
so again just taking the excess product
on the brush and just running it through
the brow so when you're happy with the
lower portion of the brow you can go in
and do the top section I like to just
take a comb and just brush the hairs
slightly downwards just so that they're
out of the way and you can really get in
and define the brow Shing so for the top
portion of the brow I again start at the
head of the brow and lightly feather in
the product creating a defined line as
we go this brow is a lot more square
than this brow as you can probably tell
so I am concentrating a lot of the
product just on this part of the brow so
that I can even out the squareness of
each brow so just picking up more
product as I go always using a light
touch and a feathering motion
so once you're relatively happy with how
you filled in your brow I just go back
in with the clear brow gel and I brush
the brows back upwards
so that we has full in place with the
line you've created on the top line I'm
going to go ahead and do the other
eyebrow now I'm not going to speak
through it though so I'll let you watch
but it's just exactly the same process
that we did before so I will just either
speed it up or let you watch the process
but yeah so I'm just gonna go ahead and
do the other brow now
I'm happy with just that all I do is
going to move my dipbrow and my clear
brow gel and that's enough for me
but if I am going out or on a night out
and I have a dark eye and I really want
to make the tail of my brow really
strong I will go in with my brows
browsing Zoar brow wings Brown whatever
it's called from benefit and it's just
in the shade medium and I take the
powder side of it and I go in with a
different angle brush so I take a
different angled brush and I just dip a
little bit into the powder and I will go
in and really define the tail of my brow
so as you can see it just adds a little
bit more definition to the title of your
brow because I do like the tail of my
brow to be the strongest part
also remember while you're doing your
brows they're not going to be twins
they're going to be cousins although
we'll be sisters but they're never going
to be twins
unless you're desi Perkins and you can
make your brows absolutely symmetrical
you for me when you're happy with how
you've made the structure and the shape
of your brows I like to go in one last
time with my clear brow gel from ardell
and just set the brows in place
otherwise if I want to tint my eyebrows
so say for example I went in with my
browsing browing
browsing benefit product and I made them
a little bit too dark I'll go in with my
brow artist plumper from L'Oreal and I
have this in the lightest shade and it's
just tinted a certain blondish color and
I will lighten up lighten up my brows
with that product so that I can have my
brows match my hair a little bit more
but often I do like to just set my
browser to clear brow gel just because I
like them to be as natural as possible
even though they're not literal as
natural as possible when I can so also
on an everyday basis if I'm not going to
fill in my brows I will actually just go
in without Loreal brow bumper just to
add a little bit of color and feeling
any sparse areas on my brows so there's
so many different ways that I do it I'm
just giving you just an option or a
method today so if you don't have a
browser setting gel and you want to sort
of brush through your eyebrows and you
don't have a spoolie or anything like
that what I used to do is I just took a
toothbrush and you know they come in
sets of five or whatever I just took a
toothbrush it works just as well as a
spoolie you just brush through your
brows and if you want to set them in
place but don't have one of these as
well you could always add a little bit
of Vaseline to the toothbrush and brush
to your eyebrows it honestly does
exactly the same thing and it's even
good for your eyebrows Vaseline go ahead
and I'm pretty sure it actually makes
your eyebrows grow so yeah you could
always try that out if you don't have a
setting gel otherwise I don't have any
thing else to say about my eyebrows I'm
hoping this will be a short little video
because all my videos when suddenly have
been really long so I need to stop
talking ahem yes so if you did like this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and also subscribe to my channel
otherwise I hope you guys have a lovely
day and I'll see you in my next video
