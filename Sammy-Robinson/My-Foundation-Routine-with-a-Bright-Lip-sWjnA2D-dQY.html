today I did a flawless skin routine a
bold lip and a simple I just a really
easy makeup look so if you like what you
see keep on watching peg Lena's sheer
glowing the Stromboli
so I'll be using the concealer from tree
much
the color vanilla
and you've seen me do this before
I won't talk about us than you watch
so I
design
I've already win it
so first I'd like to get rid of all the
harsh lines so I just
yes
Jessop brush and my strollers kick and
I'm gonna take the banana banana shake
then I take this other one you take the
pink one the creamy pinky one and I'm
gonna run that down the rest of the
spots that we can see it
then taking my Sigma Lodge how to brush
the f20 and my hourglass ambient
lighting powder in dim light I'm just
gonna powder the rest
okay so my eyebrows under I'm just going
to I'm taking this Mac Paint Pot in soft
backup and there's just a crush
so now I'm just setting that paint pot
in place the powder from
now adding mascara I'm just using the
toast of a problem what you saw from
Maria
all right so after I did my lashes now
I'm gonna move back onto the face so I'm
going to start by closing out my skin
with this L'Oreal solo Universal I'm
gonna use this prestige brush mini
powder brush
I would explain what I'm doing but I
feel it's very self-explanatory I'm just
going underneath my cheekbones bronzing
out my cheeks are sugar Oh
a good thing to follow is to do three
temples underneath your cheekbone and
then underneath your Jolla
right then I'm taking this no-name brush
and I'm going into bonds
rather than rendering brands ring
a skin
when we're creating a
shudders
it's part of your ear that's the one
that's your tripping
and I like to come it's just the end
my idea
yeah
so we're just lightly taking it across
the chocolate the tempos as well just
creating a color balance within the face
says different chunks of bronze on the
cheeks so as well some shades on the
forehead and then lastly just
so now I'm going to take L'Oreal's Lula
blush in sandalwood pink
and so I like to just find the apple of
my cheek and just lightly fill it in
directing it towards more of the bottom
of the apple of the cheek and then I
just drag it up
then I take this bodyshop brush doesn't
have a name it's just from the body shop
and I go into my mary-lou manizer by the
balm I'm just gonna highlight certain
areas to brighten up my face a little
bit give myself a bit of a glow
now I like to take the Australis make up
finishing sprints
eight
they should looks big on okay now for
the exciting part the lips we're going
to go for a nice bright color today so
I'm just starting off by lining my lips
with this Jordana lip pencil in red
you take the rimmel apocalypse look
velvet
orange orange ology
so I hope you guys enjoyed this flawless
skin routine and this simple eye and pop
of color in the list
um please like if you liked and
subscribe it would help me out a lot and
that'd be so please do as well but yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
