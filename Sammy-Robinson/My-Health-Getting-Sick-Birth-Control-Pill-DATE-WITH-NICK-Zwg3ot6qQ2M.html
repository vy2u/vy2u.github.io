so while Nicolas has accepted the
challenge of staying in bed all day is
this true I thought I would whip out the
vlogging camera and start a new minogue
hello say yeah sick
yeah
I hope you're having a lovely day let's
get this one started every youtuber
do you realize long I'll do the
husband's yeah your husband so you sleep
with the camera make sure that you can
capture any content at all times I've
been back in Sydney for probably like
four or five days now at this point I've
been pretty busy I've just been going to
events and like meetings so today was my
free day and Nick's day off so I thought
it would be a perfect opportunity to
vlog and just update you guys on what is
going on oh and also I've got a really
sick event I've got a little I have a
really sick event though I have a really
sick event that I'm going to tonight so
I'll bring you guys along to that it's
the patron national Tokyo International
tequila day celebration
hey guys I'm sorry I've already been
shit I basically have just done a load
of washing dishwasher cleaned all the
boxes I'll show you guys downstairs
because I got sent like lots of packages
while I was away and I'm just not
feeling that well like I feel quite I
have like vertigo it's basically you
just feel like you're spinning
constantly
and I basically booked myself into the
doctor so I'm going to the doctor
tomorrow to sort out this sinus issue
and I'm just going to lunch now so I
thought I wanted to show you guys my
lunch at least I'm just cooking up a bit
of chicken at the moment and just before
earlier I just emptied all of these
boxes got all the packages out and have
just put that there I can't put it in my
bin because I can't fit it so I'm just
going to wait till midnight yeah just do
the load of washing Oh everything's very
good isn't it yeah so I'm just gonna put
together a big veggie stir-fry with lots
of veggies and some honey soy sauce or
something like that
yummy by the way I got sent a whole ton
of stuff from this brand called protein
world and I've never tried anything from
them before but I had this this morning
and this has got to be the yummiest
porridge thing I have eaten in my life
it literally tastes like a chocolate
cake like a fudge chocolate brownie cake
oh my god it's so yummy okay I've just
been mulling this okay so I've taken a
call-girl and I'm feeling so much better
now it was like one with power see them
all in it and I just needed it I took in
OG a pillow as well so I'm feeling okay
it was like I was so bad that I couldn't
see I was getting really dizzy
anyway now I've pulled myself together
this is what I am wearing
I'm just so cute don't remember this
dress is from I got sent it the other
day but I will leave a link to it down
below my earrings and necklace from
princess Polly and just some white
sneakers
Oh
we under your skin
Skinner makes
fantastic national margarita day the
city girl
well good morning guys it is a new
morning and feeling much better today
although I am actually on my way to the
doctor's just to figure out what is
going on in this head of mine you're
probably wondering why if you I feel
like so sick yesterday did you go out
and drink I don't really have an answer
for that to be honest I went with the
intention or just having like one
cocktail I didn't feel like it was like
a flu or a sore throat or anything I
felt like it was directly in my head so
I was like whatever you know I'll turn
Cape Saporta say I probably shouldn't
have drunk and you feel free to judge me
I don't mind whatever but anyways I'm
feeling a lot better today I was doing a
lot better last night but I'm still and
then less gonna go just asked about what
is wrong with my head because it
actually tends to hit me everyday at
around 4 p.m. and then it's like what
was happening like it's so freakin
painful it could be jet-lagged mixed
with migraine mixed with sinus issues
and I just want to go get my head
cleared so that's what I'm have to do
now then I'm gonna go to my parents
house and film a Maybelline video but
otherwise we've got my eyelash extension
appointment booked first night which I'm
trying someone new tonight so I will let
you guys know how that goes um yeah
that's on the agenda for today I'm here
doctor time not gonna bring you guys in
next it's so uninteresting so I'll see
you after alrighty so I am home now I
got my results oh I didn't get maybe
testing but I basically have sinusitis
so I've got antibiotics and while I was
there I changed my birth control pills
so feeling good basically I've just got
to take two antibiotics a day and do
like heaps of Nasonex and everything
just to clear my sinuses basically my
brain was just like suffocating because
like my nasal passages were my doggies
oh you heard it
yeah so now I'm home and I'm gonna film
on my Maybelline goodness me oh my
goodness what do we do oh my goodness oh
my goodness so is my baby girl also it's
gonna be impossible to show you guys on
this camera because this is like that
blurring camera that I own yeah it's
gonna be impossible show you but I'm
kind of breaking out on my cheek on my
forehead a little bit on this cheek as
well and I've just changed my pill over
because basically I just hate the pill I
don't want to be on the pill who's just
making me extremely Moody and extremely
just like I just felt lethargic and
gross and slow so I was asked if I could
change to something else and so he put
me on a lower dose which is fantastic
they're like the new swings and stuff
but it means that my skin potentially
could get quite bad I naturally have
pretty good skin anyway like I've never
had an issue with my skin but I'm
nervous that like going off a higher
dosage of the pill is going to like like
I'm flying my skin or like shock my skin
or do something to my skin so will say I
should just start eating healthfully
buddy
like a little pig so I will say these
eyelashes tonight the first time I'm
trying
rushon volume eye eyelashes which it
like the hectic wasn't so hopefully they
don't look too crazy
hmm
speech by lunchtime okay No
good morning guys so it's Sunday morning
and we're off to go have a Sunday lunch
down at North Bondi fish
I was really randomly at like a farm
party last night so I'm a little bit
hungover but this is actually really
nice and it's really kind of rainy and
cold today so it's definitely jumper
weather and I like it and then just have
a chilled one today because they haven't
really since I've been back but you know

Netflix series and but I'm keen
