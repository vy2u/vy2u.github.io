at about 8 a.m. by the sun shining
through it on my face which is really
annoying at the time but it's really
good because it gets me up and then I
sort of stay in bed look at my phone as
I'm sure a lot of people do and because
it's really cold and it's winter for us
at the moment I check on a jumper and
throw my hair up out of my face because
I hate having my hair out my house is
lovely and sunny in the morning which I
absolutely love as you guys can see it's
so pretty this Sun just shines through
in every single room and it just puts me
in the best best mode ever so I then
walk outside and pick a fresh lemon from
our lemon tree we have so many lemons on
that tree it is actually insane but I'm
really into lemons at the moment for
detoxifying the body so I could not be
happier about that I then head straight
up into my kitchen and I make myself a
little morning health shot so I cut a
lemon in half and then I use this
cleanse Beauty powder which is from the
Beauty chef it's a super greens formula
that helps to toxify and purify your
body I also like to put a little bit of
ginger in a some tumeric so I use this
simply organic tumeric then I like to
throw in a little bit of this apple
cider vinegar apple cider vinegar just
boosts your metabolism in the morning
and it also just makes you feel fuller
so I like to do this before breakfast
and it looks absolutely disgusting I
know and it doesn't taste that great
either but it's just got such good
ingredients so good for your body and
it's a really good way of getting your
nutrients in really quickly I absolutely
love in the mornings having a cup of tea
especially in winter it's been so cold
lately when I wake up and really warmed
me up and but also at the same time
wakes me out to tea that I use is this
yet lemon and ginger green tea and while
I'm drinking my tea I head over to my
little makeshift desk at the moment my
office has been sort of switched into a
little studio because I'm filming a
whole bunch of videos with Maybelline so
ever so I've got my little dining table
into the corner and made this cute
little desk so I like to write myself a
to-do list in the morning that way
as the day goes on I can tick off
everything that I've done and I feel
really accomplished and so I thought I'd
write you guys a little message yeah so
I just check my diary see what I have on
for the day I also look at emails or I
might answer some comments that you guys
might have left on a recent video this
kind of makes me feel like I'm on top of
everything and I can organize myself for
the rest of the day and then of course
it is completely appurtenant that I say
hello to my little fluffy ones they hang
out with me all day long so I just love
giving them cuddles and then I was
looking for Bambi all morning and she
was actually just hiding in the storage
the big cootie she likes hiding from the
others she's a lone wolf that one but
then it is time for me to go to Pilates
so I grab a banana and get changed this
is me trying to be cool and do a little
transition but I clearly are not very
good at it and then I head to my Pilates
studio so I go to K X Pilates there are
a whole bunch of K X Pilates in Sydney
and I'm pretty sure there's heaps in
other states as well it is my favorite
thing to do in the world I love it so as
you can see I look alone and it's not
usually alone the classes are usually
full but um I didn't want to film a
video in front of everyone so Paul was
kind enough to let me come in and film a
little session during the day though I
just thought I would speed through a few
of the classic moves that we do just so
you guys can see what I do when I do go
to Pilates if you guys haven't been to
Pilates I can't recommend it and I've
really improves my flexibility increases
my strength and really turns my body
I've never had such a toned body in my
entire life I also started doing boxing
sessions some mornings as well and
that's really good I love that too but I
just definitely noticed such a
difference from Pilates when I started
and especially on the reformer it is so
much fun like it doesn't feel like
you're exercising it gives you the best
ABS it gives you the best bum and I
always feel so good after doing it so
I'll leave the website 4kx down in the
description box if you guys are
interested
so after our Pilates session I always
like to grab an apple and then I go home
and it's time to jump in the shower I
don't know one of our famous midnight
drives do you need to rent or just a
silent either/or you know I'm lying
take a left up ahead we're going cats
and rats it don't stop going Joe is
crazy you know this is who we are this
is what we do
Gavin and circus know we found some of
the new movies so I just like to use a
cleanser in the morning I don't like to
exfoliate or do anything too intense to
my skin I just like to cleanse and make
sure all the sweat and everything is off
my skin and then I just brush my hair
out and do my teeth and then I use ask
Institute moisturizer currently trying
out a few different skin care products
at the moment this is what I've been
using for the last sort of month and I
absolutely love it but if you guys
looking for a really good skin care
routine that's all from the same brand I
highly recommend Kate Somerville that's
my favorite and I just really need to
get my hands on some more of it I like
to use this origins eye cream I use this
glam glow lip stinging thing I really
use any lip balm this one stings a lot
though so this is like a lip plumping
one which I don't even know why I did
that after my shower but now it's time
for breakfast so I thought I would show
you guys the breakfast that I've been
doing every single morning this is my
favorite favorite breakfast for winter
so I just wanted to show you guys the
rescue that I do the first up I pour the
oats into the big bowl and then I do two
cups of water and put that in the
microwave and I usually put it in the
microwave for about one minute and while
that's in the microwave I like to make
myself a water for the day and I also
add a little bit of this antioxidant in
a Beauty boost it is basically an
organic enzyme packed probiotic
concentrate which gives you a daily dose
of nutritional support I love putting
lemon and orange and strawberries and
any fruits that I have available it
makes drinking water a lot more
interesting and easy I like to finish
off the water with a teaspoon of chia
seeds it makes drinking water also very
filling so then my porridge is done and
I just add in all my ingredients
this boost powders basically a protein
powder from Topeka like to have a little
bit of protein in my porridge or oats or
whatever I eat that morning just because
it's good at recovering the muscles
after I workout I add some cinnamon for
flavor and then I also add a little bit
of this immunity powder from Topeka
again this full of superfood berries and
fruits it's rich source of vitamin C and
it boosts the immune system in the cold
months is the first winter in a long
time that I have not got sick I think
it's a miracle so I I think it's down to
all these natural minerals and vitamins
that I've been taking so anyway I mix
that all through my porridge and then I
add my agave syrup and my vanilla
essence again for flavor and now it's
time for the toppings so I add half a
banana some peanut butter from mavis
which is just 100% organic peanuts and
some chia seeds on top for some Omega 3
I love banana with oats and especially
because my oats are nice and chocolatey
now it's just the yummiest yummiest
combination I'm completely obsessed with
it and then I like to drizzle some
peanut butter over the top and then yes
the chia seeds are again I'm going to
fill you up a little bit are a great
source of Omega 3 with protein and fiber
in it before I eat my delicious
breakfast I like to just make sure I
give everything a wipe down and clean
all my dishes put them in the dishwasher
and then I head back over to my desk and
I eat my breakfast my breakfast this is
generally where I'll either start
editing for the day depending on whether
I have a video filmed or I will
alternatively start filming for the day
so yeah that was my morning routine I
really hope that you guys have enjoyed
it I'll leave all the information down
in the description box if I was going
too fast and you didn't catch anything I
love it if you could give this video a
thumbs up to let me know that you like
these routine videos and I'll be sure to
do more in the future thanks so much for
watching guys I will see you in my next
video ok
