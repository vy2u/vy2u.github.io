yes let's just jump straight to the Q&amp;amp;A
hey Sony have you lived in Australia
whole life and what background see have
lucky know how many brothers and sisters
to you so um my camera just died and I
remember it was Georgia asked me
something and I can remember what it was
Oh have I ever lived anywhere but
Australia what is my background and
having brothers and sisters do I have so
I've only ever lived in Australia I am
English Irish Australian and I have and
I have three siblings I have an older
brother and two younger sisters are you
in make me love you love you too um me
and that man Nick met through my friend
Angus Angus is Nick's good friend from
school I worked at a pub with Angus and
Nick came and had drinks at that pub so
yeah - precious is young just wondering
got your favourite floaters okay my
favourite food changes all the time it
has to be truckers I am I'm very
specific them and I'm I'm a very
habitual creature I go to truckers and I
get the Portuguese burger combo I go to
sushi train and I get a little tuna
rolls cooked tuna with black rice I go
to fresh bread fresh blends and I get my
Thai salad or an acai bowl and I go to
tie
and I get Thai green curry yeah I get I
bet you guys are expecting me to just be
like Oh chuckling no um where do you
usually get your trophies from they're
really pretty
um I don't actually have many chokers at
all I don't really wear any chokers
except for this one and this one is from
princess Polly I've I wear like every
day I'm completely obsessed with it oh
that's so cute I didn't meet you guys
again photo with you um my favorite
thing to order a chuck is it would be it
mixes between the schnitzel burger at
the Portuguese burger and the original
chicken burger but it all has to be in a
combo because those chips my favorite
app on my phone would be Instagram or
snapchat I can't choose um my favorite
youtubers oh I love sailing lavaca bond
I think that's such a cool story
I love obviously cardio and all my
friends on YouTube um Chloe
Morello she's hilarious um I love Trisha
Paytas vlog Channel she just seems like
the cutest cuddly muffin I just want to
cuddle her his thing I don't know I just
love watching her telling me my broken
have been together um we have been to
for probably about nine months now I'd
say so not that long but getting there
getting to a year Hey
I just want to know if you struggle
through high school and hey I became an
Emily and got any issues or function
issues I'm like if they're like tips and
tricks like say no type of work and
somebody ever specialized and everything
in here thank you ready oh my god it's
so cute
I'm probably the worst person to ask
when it comes to school because I'm
pretty lucky I had a pretty cruisy
high school experience I had such an
amazing high school it was such a chill
it was so chilled such a small group of
girls there was about 80 of us in the
year and it was down at a beach so we
just had such nice vibes all the time
I had such a lovely year group I don't
think anyone was necessarily mean um
friends are so many different groups of
people such lovely lovely girls and I
mean obviously there's going to be
fallout like I did have a few fall outs
in my school experience but that's
completely normal like no one's going to
stay friends forever
and you grow apart so that's completely
normal so don't let it affect you if
that does happen to you because it is
completely normal when it comes to
studying the best at studying I was a
massive procrastinator but I think it's
just important to not let the stress get
to you because at the end of the day
although your school marks do mean a lot
it's not everything just important to
stay calm and just important to make
sure that you are you are living a
balance that you are socializing that
you are doing a bit of everything sport
exercising I did a lot of basketball so
I was constantly exercising to like
relieve stress yeah I just think the
number one thing is just don't let
stress get to you because yes it is
stressful it feels like it's the end of
the world sometimes but really it's not
and you just need to relax and try and
cruise through as much as possible but
then also knuckle down and work when it
appropriate mum did you never play any
sports with you
yes I've played a lot of basketball um I
loved basketball I played red basketball
school basketball club basketball I
loved what I played it from a very young
age in primary school all the way up
until just after high school and now
I've stopped probably love to get a team
like a social team together just to get
exercise I love it but just for exercise
your baby don't really have a celebrity
crush to be honest maybe maybe Scott
Disick I think he's the biggest legend
in the Kardashians like I would watch
that show just to watch him I think he
is hilarious hi Sam could you please
tell us a story about your first kiss I
love your videos so much oh thank you
did you guys hear that it was like can
you tell us the story about your first
kiss
my first kiss was a snack out of home I
was with my friend Laura Ella and we
went and met this group of guys and she
I had never kissed a boy and never
really spoken to a boy I accidentally
clicked on that I have been to America
yes but back to the first kiss story um
so I was with my friend Laura and she
was really boy experienced at this point
she loved hanging out boys but besides
for my brother I hadn't really ever
spoken to a boy before and I was a very
late bloomer I think my first kiss was
my rose like sixteen or seventeen and
everyone had kissed boy so I was like
just do it just go just do it so I snuck
out with her at night and we went and
met these boys down the beach and then
there was an abandoned house that we
snuck into um and I kissed a guy on the
deck looking out at the beach I was
probably a terrible kisser I don't think
he knows that I was supposed to say this
so I was probably
again oh my god yeah I was probably an
absolute shocker as everyone would be on
my first kiss but um I only have at the
moment this cartilage piercing this ring
in my tapia I had a Swarovski crystal
above it but it fell out and I lost it
and I think that's quite a stop now
unfortunately but I love having a stud
with the ring if I do get them pierced
again I'll probably just repierced that
same one what's my favorite dog I could
not tell you they are so opposite it's
known funny Henry Henry Henry is the
shyest little baby you can't even ever
see him he's completely black but he's
the most gorgeous little puffin I have
ever laid my eyes on I'm completely
obsessed with him he's just like the
biggest sweetheart ever and then Gidget
is a she is a boss lady she wants to
boss me around that dog I swear she's so
so much attitude she's much older she's
like 9 I think and Henry's in the leg
too um but gitche bosses Henry around
and bosses all of us around and thinks
she just owns the house she's very well
trained those social she'll do what
she's told but she's just better she's
got so much attitude she's so Sassy's
completely opposite I would never be
able to choose between them that you
started YouTube as a hobby anything on
it I'm so successful because of it
Thanks oh that's me um yeah it was
really random because I did it no I'm
not knowing at all where it would take
me what what I would do I just loved
makeup and I was so into makeup at this
point this was like when I would go to
Priceline and spend 500 bucks and just
do everyone's makeup like I do for fun
I'd do it when I got home
school I loved it so I've got a wind off
make up a little bit I love it just as
much but I just don't wear as much of it
necessarily um but the fact that it's
now my job is just literally the
weirdest thing to me like I I don't even
know like it's just so hard to explain
it's like the coolest thing ever like
