today's video is my highly requested
skincare routine in this video I will be
showing you my in depth deep cleaning
routine which I do generally before I go
to bed just to get rid of any dirt that
I have picked up during the day so let's
jump into the video the first step that
I do is I pick up my micellar water by
ganya to remove whatever makeup I have
been wearing during that day in this
instant I actually had a fresh fake time
until yes I'm very aware my skin looks
quite orange but it was just the
lightening and the lights are really
reflecting quite harshly but yeah I take
off any of the excess makeup tan dirt
that may be sitting on my skin just
before I cleanse my skin and you guys
will see how much will be on that cotton
pad this micellar water is really nice
and really gentle so I then take my
doctor Spiller cleansing milk with
cucumber extract which I was clearly out
of SOSAD of uses for so long and yeah so
when I finally get that out I will just
use that to gently remove any excess
dirt on my face and give a gentle
revitalization to the skin this dr.
Spiller regime was prescribed to me when
I got a facial from face media sparring
bun day so it's done such nice things to
my skin it's so gentle and it just
really keeps my skin really and really
clean I make sure to do this step just
sort of to melt any excess makeup that
may be sitting on my face off my face
and just get rid of any of the excess
dirt that's on the surface and depending
on how much makeup I'm wearing that day
I may take my
bareMinerals clay chameleon transforming
purifying cleanser which has Brazilian
red clay and sea salt and lots of
minerals in it so this will just give my
skin more of a deep cleanse and just
generally remove any impurities that
might be sitting on my skin so then at
this stage I'll take my vanity planet
ultimate skin star set which comes with
three different attachment heads
it comes with obviously the power and
then it comes with a daily cleansing
brush and exfoliating brush which are
the two am holding here and then yeah
that's the daily cleansing brush which
I've overused it's very dead heat and
then the silicon brush which is the
nicest brush of them all I think so
usually I'll use this one which is the
daily cleansing brush but I've just I've
overused it and it's just a bit daily so
I'll need to get a new one so lately
I've been using the exfoliating brush
just on the lowest setting and as you'll
see this will just get rid of the rest
of the impurities that have built up on
my face throughout the day and it takes
off any of the dead skin and the texture
that is just sitting on the surface of
my face so it just gives me that extra
cleanse that I want and makes your skin
feel so so incredibly soft so as you can
see here this brush just gets right down
into the grit of your skin and takes off
any of that excess dirt so I then pick
up my jojoba peeling cream by dr.
Stiller and this contains a little bit
of jojoba wax which acts as an exfoliant
and takes off any dead skin I use this
with the silicon head by vanity planet
which is by far my favorite brush and I
use it on the lowest setting and just
slowly massage it into my skin so it's
like giving your face unless massage it
feels so amazing but generally I use
this brush to target blackheads and the
any congestion in my pores which just
yeah just get gives that extra cleanse
down into the skin so the best thing
about the silicone brush is that it's
very durable and you don't have to worry
about changing both brush heads every
few months which I've obviously had to
do with my other one because the other
ones do get quite dirty but this one you
just rinse it off and it's good as new
and if you guys would like to get your
hands on one of these vanity planet
ultimate skin spa sets I have a discount
code for you down in my description box
so if you guys are interested I
definitely recommend these brushes I
have the Clarisonic brush as well and
these honestly work just as well and
they are so much cheaper so they're
definitely a great affordable buy for
you guys sorry I have so much to say in
such a little time but here I'm just
using my doctor's Spiller cucumber toner
on another cotton round and I'm just
making sure I get all the cleansing
products off and I'm just rebalancing my
pH levels with this toner and if I feel
like having a bit of a pamper night I'll
use a face mask so I've been using the
glam glow mask I'm not sure this call
but it's the purple one and I've been
loving it lately cuz it just really
tightens the skin and makes my skin feel
so incredibly clean like what once you
peel this base mask off it just feels
like it's got it's just tightened every
single one of your pores in your face
and just left you with really really
baby baby soft skin so as you can see
I've just placed in my problem areas
I've just been having a few breath like
if you break that to my chin and then
just where my pores and my blackheads
are so after ten minutes I will just
peel that off and it just makes my skin
feel so soft
facemasks just make me if anything just
mentally feel better about myself and I
feel like my skin isn't looking at that
great so one step I definitely cannot go
without is my moisturizer this one is
again.everything which is so sad but
it's the propolis day cream by dr.
Stiller and basically it is just a day
cream that is antibacterial and prevents
breakouts but it just makes my skin feel
super hydrated which is super important
to me especially after all the cleansing
products that we have used on our skin
and when I want to give myself a little
bit of extra hydration I take my dr.
Brandt power dose vitamin D which just
also gives me that extra hydration when
I've done so much cleansing and my skin
is so tight it just ensures that I have
all the essential oils in my skin and
then finally I take my origins eye cream
I like to make sure I use eye cream
overnight so that the next day it just
reduces all the fine lines and provides
moisture when applying concealer so your
concealer goes on really nicely so that
is my skin care routine complete I hope
you guys enjoyed it make sure to give a
thumbs up if you did and I will see you
very shortly in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
