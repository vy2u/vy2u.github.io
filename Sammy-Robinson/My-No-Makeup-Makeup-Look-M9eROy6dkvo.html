today's video is going to be a no makeup
makeup look
I mean wanting to do this for a little
while but actually haven't got around to
doing it so I've tried to achieve the
most natural look as possible to make it
look like I'm Ness not you know to make
it look like I'm not necessarily wearing
any makeup
obviously it's never going to really
look like you're not wearing any makeup
but the game is just to achieve the most
natural look as possible and to make you
look as healthy as possible I suppose
that's that's my main goal so if you
guys are back to see my take on a no
makeup makeup look then just keep
watching just cleanse my skin and now
I'm going to moisturize I've been trying
out a new skin care regime for the last
probably three weeks now so I'll
probably update you guys on that very
soon but um I've been using a Korean
bread and it's Lagaan sillas sellers
sellers mind moisture creams
moisturizing your skin is probably one
of the most important steps of no makeup
makeup look or one of those natural
makeup days because it just adds that
sort of natural glow back into your skin
and makes it look really healthy and
like plump almost I've been using the
glam glow power mud at wet lip balm
treatment before I do my makeup every
morning okay so now on to foundation I'm
it going to take my Rimmel freshest skin
foundation I just did a lot of Facebook
live with Rimmel on the peasant page of
the day with Rachel Brooke and we found
that this this foundation was really
perfect for sort of everyday use because
it's a really really thin consistency so
I'm taking it the freshest skin in the
shade 303 true nude so you want to just
take the spatula and spread the product
all over your face because this is a no
makeup makeup look you're just going to
take the smallest amount of this
foundation and put it in the areas that
you really want to provide a little bit
of coverage but a very very thin layer
of it so that it's not obvious and you
can't see it on the skin okay so once
you've put it onto your skin I just take
my fingers and I like to just Pat that
in
the warmth of your fingers is really
going to melt the product into your skin
okay in the background so as you can see
that's giving me a really nice natural
coverage as it's been getting hotter in
Sydney this is where I've been wearing
lately because it's probably the
thinnest foundation I own and it
provides me with the perfect amount of
coverage it still lets my skin look like
skin but still you know sort of evens
out my skin tone and provides that
little bit of coverage that you want you
know when you're feeling a bit dull or
you're feeling a bit tired and I love
that it has the natural mineral powders
in it that you know absorbs any excess
oil and keeps your shine at base so I've
always been the biggest fan of
foundations that provides a most
lightweight feel on the skin I really
love the water the water-based feeling
of foundations and this one definitely
definitely gives that so if you guys are
going for a foundation that you want to
give you the most lightweight feel on
your skin but still provide a nice sort
of lightweight coverage this is perfect
for you what I also found really cool
about this foundation when I was doing
the live feed was that they were telling
me that it's actually got aloe vera
chamomile and like clb or something in
it so I think it's really nice when you
know you're putting a product on your
face every day that has natural
ingredients in it so that it's not you
know not putting too many excessive
chemicals on your skin every single day
and of course I think it's a place that
has the SI SPF 15 in it because if it's
again every day where you want to have a
bit of protection on your skin so I
really do recommend this so once you've
got the coverage you desire make sure
you keep it as natural as possible you
almost want a few floors showing through
so that it does look skin because
obviously we're all human and we all
have flaws so you don't want to cover
absolutely everything that you want to
maybe just even out your skin tone a
little bit so now because I do have a
bit of darkness under my eyes and sort
of in the inner corner I'm going to go
in with my Urban Decay Naked skin colour
correcting fluid in the shade Paige you
will never remember that using a color
corrector isn't for the purpose of
concealing it's just to color correct so
you
want to make sure you blend it out as
best as possible and use the smallest
amount as possible and then on the outer
corner as well so I'm just blending it
out with my finger now just to melt it
into the skin again with the warmth of
your fingertips and remember every step
that I'm doing I almost don't want it to
be that noticeable to you guys because
we want to stick as natural as possible
so if there's any dramatic changes it's
almost not a good thing you want to stay
as subtle as possible with every step
okay how's that we mean business now
we're going to add a little bit of
warmth back into the skin very subtly
and I'm going to use my Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless
coverage complete coverage concealer in
the shade dark neutral and so for me I
love using cream products for my
everyday sort of natural makeup looks
because it melts into the skin and is
way less obvious than powders this is
probably my most natural cream contour
that I own I have the LA girl and I have
my clinic one but this one's probably
the most natural one so the one I'm
going to go with today beauty blenders
are also great for everyday and no
makeup makeup looks because especially
in wet babe unders because what they're
going to do is the water will take any
of the excess product away and then also
just melt the product into your skin
I don't even know if you guys can see
whether concealers being placed like
that's how minimal we're contouring
because I don't want it to be obvious at
all I want it to be just like a few
shades darker than my skin with that
little bit of foundation we put on we
obviously sort of concealed any of the
redness in our cheeks so I want to go
back in and put a little bit more flush
into the cheeks to do that I'm going to
use a cream as well because obviously
creams are the most natural way to melt
a product into your skin and look the
least like makeup I'm going to use my
Rimmel adamant cream to powder blush in
the shade
0:04 regal rose because this is more of
a natural blush tone to me so I'm just
going to take a little bit of my finger
and just Pat that into the apple of my
cheek I generally like to take it up
here on my nose um and then across up
way up here in this section because
putting in here I generally find looks
like a little bit more flushed and
almost as if you're a bit sunburned it
to me anyway I get some bird in this
area here and I get flushed up there as
well so I take it up sort of this little
triangle area here and then of course
along the cheekbone as well love the
formula of this blush as well because
it's almost a wax that like melts at the
touch of your fingertip but it's a
really really lightweight formula and it
just glides onto the skin and is very
blendable now I'm going to go in with a
cream highlighter as well so I'm going
to strategically places very minimally
on the high points of my face i'm using
my josie maran argan Enlightenment in
losing in luminizing wand this is my
favorite product at the moment it just
looks so natural because I think it's
argan based it's um it's just a lot more
blendable and just sits on the skin
really nicely so I'm just putting a
little bit of my cheekbones so when I'm
thinking oh they make up make up look
for me it's what I would like to look
like what I'm not worrying
so I'd like to look flushed because I
think it's really pretty to have a bit
of a flush and I'd like to look a little
bit jewy but not too over-the-top so
that's why I haven't used any powders
and as you can see sort of it looks just
really fresh so you look quite healthy
so so at this step we've used all the
cream products we want so you can go
ahead and by all means put some powder
on if it's too jewelry for you but
that's sort of what I like to achieve or
another alternative is that you take
your powder brush with you know whatever
excess powder was on it from the time
before you used it and you could just
sort of place that over your t-zone this
will sort of absorb any excess oils and
just put whatever powders left over on
the brush onto your face so now I'm
going to take my benefits
Ready Set brow clear brown setting gel
um have you always say that weirdly I'm
lucky and that I have sort of full
enough brows they're not necessarily
perfectly shaped but um there's enough
hair there that I don't need to put any
extra product in so I just run a clear
setting gel through my brows just to
make sure that they stay in place okay
so now I'm going to take my Rimmel brow
this way a highlighting pencil but I'm
not going to use it on my brow bone I'm
going to use it in my waterline so I'm
also going to put that on my inner
corner as well now you can take an
eyelash curler if you have one I like to
curl my lashes and if you want to go
really no makeup makeup you can just
curl them and leave them like that or
that just worked out so many of my
eyelashes I'm taking my Bobbi Brown i
opening mascara this is an incredible
mascara see this wand is pretty big and
I probably shouldn't be using this on
and sort of everyday makeup look but um
yeah I am because I love it a trick I
learnt from Chloe Morello is that you
just put at the base of your lashes and
then don't um
swipe upwards because obviously your
natural lashes tend to have a little bit
of blonde on the ends of it this is just
adding a bit of definition to your lash
line I like to put a
little bit on the tip scotch got a
little bit on the tips um of the ends of
my lashes cuz it'll pull your eyes out
words and up words for me I wouldn't put
anything on my lips because I think
that's a dead giveaway when you have
lipstick on but um just to give you guys
an option I usually will take my lips
but better color and all I would do is a
lip liner so the lip liner I use for
this is the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
lip pencil
whose names are so long and uptight and
with like the lightest hand possible I'm
going to really lightly define the
outside of my lips and you want to drag
it in a little bit just so it's not like
a line
so that's it really you can probably use
this setting spray if you would like so
I might use the Urban Decay second spray
in this clip because that's just sitting
right next to me so that is the end of
the video today I hope you guys have
enjoyed this look make sure to subscribe
