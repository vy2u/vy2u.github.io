of all he were all very very very
intrigued about Lulu Nikolas
so I thought I would give you a little
bit of story time about me and Nick to
say that um because I thought I'd told
you guys I think I have told you I
telling them how that all went down I'll
give you a villain extended response to
Nicholas everyone wants to know about
Nick to a weak box so there was a those
a few questions that are a lot so how
did I meet Nick so I worshipped my
friend called Angus and Angus his next
friend Nick was rowing for Australia or
International Court of somewhere
published another terrible government
and he was in someone growing in
Canberra with Australia and so I've
never seen him before in my entire life
he I knew a lot of anguses friends and
they all came in but yet never seen
before anyway Angus uploads a picture
onto Instagram I saw that it was Nick
and I was like oh my goodness I remember
say Cameron fresh out of Laurel Holly
Behrens I think it was Laura and I was
like I'm going to marry him I'm going to
make that guy my boyfriend anyway I
comment on this I think I come in on the
picture I can't remember if I commented
on the picture or if I just told Angus
to tell him I liked him or something and
that sounds really conceited of me I
understand that a lot of you will be
like oh like love of us I doesn't exist
because that's a total totally physical
thing but I could do some so much I I
think Nick is so handsome now he's the
most beautiful boy I see but at the time
I actually didn't find him that
attractive I had to why that sounds so
bad I think is beautiful now I think is
that my time something ever but that's
cuz I'm in love with him yeah I did find
him that attractive back then and I just
noticed something about him something
about him that was drawing me to him
sounds so silly fair love so I get
except one way or another from that
photo I get next number and he texts me
being like hey were you doing like my
Monday I was like yeah and so the day
forth rooks has to have meaning because
you know he's in between jobs now he
loved his role you have to figure out a
different career choice so he has a
meeting with some guy that's going to
help him out with his career and so
that's our date falls through but I
happen to work at this pub that he then
goes for drinks after at and I was at
the pub just having drinks I wasn't
actually working and he walks in those
like oh my
and these things first thing I said
today's when I saw him I was like here's
the skinniest car so but he does a very
small part of massive chest and very
strong Boyd then he can't put weight on
in his cars he's got the biggest I've
ever it's it's the funniest thing anyway
that's the first very notice about him
so I say I said I was like no I don't
think so
see like ditch me on my date I'm like
him we go for drinks I'm like whatever
about him kind of offered and then we go
to an our friend's house afterwards to
just like have a few more drinks because
we left the pub I remember just saying
to him I was like look like we can just
be friends
see how it goes I doesn't matter we
kissed that night I remember we kissed
that night a little bit tipsy and gave
him a big smooch because I remember one
of his friends was like they were
kissing and I said babe I will so I
walked up to him and gave him a big
smooch I'm Charlie remember this and
then yes I say even like look you know I
just come out of I hadn't just come out
of bed with the last guy singing
actually illegal Asko seeing the last
guy that I studied quite liked which I
thought I really liked at the time but
he was a total douchebag
yes you know when you're like cringe at
someone you dated in the past and like
how did I even ever look I was like the
last guy was saying was a total dickhead
and I'm not really into having flings
for people at the moment I kinda want to
be single so like we can see each other
but like just so you know it was like
yeah cool no worries ever anyway so we
see each other that night and then the
next day is his birthday and he's like
you want to go for drinks gear tonight
and I was like oh he liked any was go to
drinks with me on his birthday so that
like all his friends and my friends
would come into one with a date or
anything then didn't speak to him for a
week and then saw him the following
weekend where he was a total dickhead I
was like get this guy out of my life
like as he would be which is so fair
enough he has he did such a transitional
phase he's just come from doing full
time growing where you would never even
be allowed to have a drink and then you
since school so he's basically went
straight from school to like
professional rowing and then now he's
not rowing and so it's like I'm just
going to let loose have fun with my
friends
I don't care about anything and little
ol me was already hard for it at this
point I was like why wouldn't he to put
a spend time with me so he was just you
know going around with his friend having
drinks going drunk like doing what you
would do as a boy that's just less like
a full-time job so I was like nah I'm
not keen like this is just too much for
me like he's obviously in this point of
his life and it's he needs to have this
time with his friends I think this draw
I'm not lying this draw to him I
couldn't stay away from him I was like
we were put away right now lived alone
it's not going to work low like you just
I can't really remember how but we just
kept seeing each other and this was all
before I went to Europe by the way so I
was like I can't gain anything I'm back
for year it's like two and a half months
I go it's just going to be if I go
away Lala
three four weeks go by we're already or
I love you that we wouldn't be together
but we're boyfriend and girlfriend like
the mushy as couple but like still
pretty like spicy he's like in this
party stage of his life and so I was
like you got to chill out and he was
like no and that's there Hospice is good
but I was like I'm going to Europe then
he was like okay so it's still like we
were like upset you know when you're
just like obsessed with each other and
that was us
I don't know if you guys even know what
I'm talking about but like I knew I was
going away jar just so sensitive about
the whole thing I think I can't be with
you so ridiculous so I go to Europe and
then I come back and then when I come
back like being away from each other to
like two and a half months kind of just
really set in how much we really liked
each other like I was so had in heal to
miss him everyday and I gotta say I've
enjoyed myself immensely in Europe I
loved it like didn't let that affect me
I made sure I had fun and everything but
it just really said in how much I missed
him and wanted to be with him so then
when I got back he had sort of settled
down found a job which is his career now
he's moved on like that he was actually
very very clever very smart and is
already in a full-time job which like
props to him because I think I would be
a crazy mess going from such a life
transition so he's just the best guy
ever and we're actually gross
perfect for chiller which I love and my
family loves him he lost my family I
love his family it just it just works
so yes anyway that's the story of me and
Nick I thought I had told you guys that
story maybe and I told you more briefly
but I know a lot of you who were very
curious so it wasn't all smooth sailing
I know like obviously on everything you
see in history on books been sailing but
everyone has faced like it's so normal
to have fights and we definitely had
fights more so at the beginning because
we were just you know when you're just
so obsessed with the person you get
sensitive about everything yeah and and
then yeah what was the first kiss story
and unfortunately it wasn't a very
romantic first kiss story I went up and
basically forced into kissing
grabsy face was like away career I'm
pretty confident like I know I want
something I go for it totally care like
it what if he was like you've got me I
don't know what I was like don't tell us
and a lot of you guys asked when we're
getting engaged if we've talked about
marriage etc etc and yes we talked about
marriage all the time I wouldn't be with
him if I didn't think I could
potentially marry him hey chill out
Samantha you're not going to get married
you're like 21 years old but I'll
obviously I'm just going to wait like
five four years or matter how everybody
you know time feels right it'll happen
or it might not
who knows that's the crazy thing about
YouTube I'll watch this video back in
Mike's idea to be like whoa either it's
exactly what I said it would be or
nothing like I said it would be what was
my experience with boys in high school
my face was pretty good because I went
to an all-girls school which was pretty
far away from the city where kind of
every other school was not every other
school but a lot of schools were on bus
systems where they got to catch buses to
and from school together and they got to
meet each other we were very secluded I
was down at a little beach you know
little school and I didn't necessarily
make that many boys you know my first
kiss was probably at 16 17 for my
experiences and sexual Dept I know
that's very taboo to talk about but they
were all very late I waited for a lot of
things I waited till I found someone I
loved and that was my first boyfriend
who was a real
a really good guy so um yeah I mean my
suppose is a fine but I didn't really
rush into anything when I was young and
I didn't really experience heartbreak
necessarily when I was young so I also
saw a lot of your comments about how to
get over breakups and how to deal with
dickheads and stuff and I short answered
responses just don't put up with it I
know so much easier said than done to
get out of a relationship or get out of
you know a fling with someone that's
treating you like crap but I promise you
in the end you will appreciate its so
much to sleeve them and then you look
back at like when you did data you'll be
like what the hell was I thinking truly
just leave them and I promise the
heartbreak will heal you will feel so
much better in the end
surround yourself a family surround
yourself with friends keep yourself busy
I know it's so much easier said than
done because I've only ever really been
semi I thought I was heartbroken but
what's harboring at all over a guy that
was a total ticket now that I was
backing I'm like thank God I'm out of
that and you you will promise you you'll
see that as well you will see that you
just need to escape hello guys so I am
just editing this video that you're
watching now so the Q&amp;amp;A was way too long
it was like a 25 to 30 minute video and
so I thought I would just split it up
into two parts as you've just seen here
and I thought the best going to do is to
split it into sort of boy questions and
then the other one just kind of others
other stuff I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and the story of help me and Nick
got together so we're not the fairytale
that some of you might have been
expecting but it's still it's still real
life yeah I'll link the other Q&amp;amp;A that I
do down below if you guys haven't seen
that and I'll see you in my next video
