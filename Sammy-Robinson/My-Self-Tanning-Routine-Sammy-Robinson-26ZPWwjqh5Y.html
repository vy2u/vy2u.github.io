today's video is my fake tanning routine
I just want to say at the very beginning
of this video before anything else that
I'm very very well aware that I have
naturally tanned skin to begin with so
when I get into the clips of showing you
how I do it in my actual routine itself
don't lose it at me because I do have
quite tan skin to begin with and a lot
of you will think I don't necessarily
need to fake tan and that's completely a
case that's your opinion
but it's actually probably one of my
most requested videos from you guys is
that you want to see how I do fake tan
and as you guys know I've been in Europe
a few weeks ago so I do still have a
natural tan from the European Sun yeah
so when I want to just be a little bit
extra bronzed or if I have an event on
the weekend or something I will fake it
and also another disclaimer I just want
to say that everyone obviously is
naturally beautiful the way you are
there's no need to change anything about
yourself
but some people choose to fake tan and
that's completely up to them so yeah
don't you guys don't need to write in
the comments that I don't need fake tan
and it's unnecessary because I
understand that some of you may think
that but I like to do it so now that
I've got that out of the way partnered
up with a loving tan in this video as
you guys would know I've been the
biggest fan of loving town for a long
time I go between loving 10 deluxe
bronzing mousse in ultra dark and then
there to our tan in dark I go between
the two so loving tan is actually the
only tan on the market that is a
professional strength and is you are
really nice olive complexion the best
part of when you're applying it though
is that you can see where your mullet
like see when you're applying it where
it's going because it actually has a
bronzer in it so when you take a shower
the next day that bronzer will come off
so don't worry if it's a little bit
patchy that's just the bronzer showing
up where you've rubbed it in and I do
have a discount code it is Sammy and
I'll leave all the details for that just
down below in the description box if you
guys want to check that out so this
weekend I
going to 21st so I thought what better
than to show you guys my routine and how
I do it so basically like any routine I
suppose it's pretty standard that they
might before their fake town you'll hop
in the shower and you will exfoliate
your skin me for example I would have
had a lot of dry skin from tanning in
Europe and in winter especially my skin
goes really flaky and dry so so I jump
in the shower and I just like to
exfoliate my skin I use the loving Ted
exfoliating myth this myth is the hairs
down a line best mitt I've used to
exfoliate my body I've used every mitt
I've used every exfoliating god and
nothing has worked as well as this one
for me so this is what I exfoliate with
before I faked hair and what I exploit
with when I'm removing my turn so yeah
so have a shower exfoliate my skin that
shaved my legs and then I will
moisturize my body the night before I'll
use any moisturizer that's handy in this
just before I faked and this time I used
Jergens which is just like a nice sort
of a body balm not really a body lotion
but it was just what I had handy in the
bathroom and then the next day I will
also then moisturize probably three
hours before I know I'm going to faked
out so once all the prep is done for
your skin and you have baby soft smooth
skin will then grab whatever fake tan
you use for me it's the loving tan a
deluxe bronzing mousse in ultra dark and
I use the loving tan mitt if you guys
are buying a mitt definitely this get
this one from Lovington the one that has
the two fluffy sides it's like a big big
cook admit bigger than me and I always
begin on my forearms I grab two pumps of
tan and I begin to massage that into my
forearm then I grab two more pumps and I
do my upper arm and my shoulder so then
I move on to my other arm and do it
exactly the same way then I go on to my
tummy and my chest doesn't really matter
which order you go sometimes I go my
chest head my stomachs and just like
anyone I'll just use the mitt to spread
it around all my shoulders and Michael
a little bit my neck so then I'll grab
two more pumps and I will do the lower
part of my leg and then I often grab
three pumps I do a thigh area and around
the bum then I will all come in here for
my way around on my back after got up
the sides of my back like this and
around this side like side of my waist
and get the back of my shoulders
everything and then I'll swap hands and
I'll do the other side just down the
half okay
I do the awkward bend the elbow below
and then do it above and to like get
sort of every part of my back and if I
have my mum there or someone I'll just
get her to do it for me or sometimes I'm
lazy and I don't even do my back and
then once I have faked and my back and
my legs and everything I use whatever is
left over on the mitt and I will just
take that lightly over my hands and
between my fingers and then I'll put
some of my feet as well just whatever
the excess is on the applicator me a
good tip though before you fake tan your
hands and your feet is some moisturizer
on your knuckles and the dry areas
right before you fake tan that way it'll
stop the town from UM settling into
those dry areas and getting really much
darker than the rest of it so then I
used to always just grab the mitt and I
used to just put fake tan all over my
face then I found when I woke up in the
mornings or when I washed the tan off it
would just stay really dark around my
dry areas or whenever I had a few
breakouts and it were just really bad so
I started strategically placing my fake
tan on my face so it gives me the effect
that I want when I put my makeup on so
you know hollow cheekbones and just
bronze on the outer perimeter of my face
I grab a brush around top kabuki brush
and I just begin to start chiseling out
my cheekbones at the fake tan and then I
put it around my forehead
and then I might put a little bit on the
sides of my nose and my chin on my
jawbone and then I'll grab a bigger
brush and I'll maybe a little bit more
product and I begin to just blend it out
and give the skin more bronzed effect as
opposed just contour okay so this tank
actually lasts up to ten days on me it
has lasted up to ten days but I need to
make sure that I'm moisturizing every
single day so then my final tip for my
fake tanning routine would be that right
before it's a new product of theirs it's
their bronze shimmer but I've always
always always been really obsessed with
body shimmers so right before I go to my
events I will put on a little bit of
this bronze shimmer in ultra dark and
that'll just give me a little bit more
vibrancy so a little bit more color but
then will just give me a really nice
overall glow because you'll have light
shimmers all over your body so that when
the light touches your skin you're just
way so the best part about the bronze
shimmer is that it just gives you
instant results so you can actually wear
it on its own and it'll give you a
really nice deep tan and it looks so
incredible in flash photography also in
case any of you are wondering it
actually comes in three shades medium
dark and ultra dark so yeah that's what
I do before I go to events and just when
I want to make myself look a little bit
extra bronzed I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'll leave all the details
for all the products that I use below
and I will talk to you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
