literally just ended my last vlog
because I realized it's gonna be too
long so this is going to be my trip of
st. Tropez and when I get up to with
Clarence so this morning I've got up at
4:45 I started to talk outside I was
just really jet-lagged and I couldn't
sleep so I've been planning some really
fun secret things and then I went down
and had breakfast at 7 a.m. it was so
dark and no one was there so I think I'm
gonna wait a little bit later to get in
go breakfast but then I went to the gym
and I've already been to the spa that's
my way my hair is wet I'm gonna bring
you guys along to the spa
next time I go cuz I'm gonna go tomorrow
as well it was so nice it was just nice
to have a bit of a sweat after the 30 30
to 40 30 to 40 hour trip that I went
through yesterday so I have about 45
minutes to kill before I've got to meet
everyone I'm so excited to finally meet
everyone I feel like I've been alone for
days like it's been crazy it's been
really amazing um but I'm definitely not
someone that likes traveling alone so
I'm excited to finally mingle and meet
some people we're meeting at 1:00 p.m.
for lunch so I'm gonna go to the pool
for it yeah about 45 minutes I think and
then I'm gonna come down on it get ready
yeah we'll get the day started
I have just done my makeup I have a very
very bad feeling about wearing a white
top with the red lip I just know it's
gonna end up away for myself I've really
been vibing the red lip read the book
I've really been vibing the red lip
lately I don't know this is the Zoe the
one that I used in my last video by the
way the last tutorial this whole makeup
look is just exactly the same right now
so I'm gonna head down to the lobby now
and meet everyone and we're going to a
beautiful cafe a camera but it's cold
but I'll tell you guys one my bed I just
went for a plain white thing but my
check-in pads and summer red shoes I
don't know if you can see it very well I
don't have a full-length mirror so I
can't really show you guys properly but
I actually have no idea what to expect
really from anything I don't know if I
don't know anyone let cetera except show
but I'm excited oh my goodness
so we are going to lunch now we're just
walking a beautiful streets at the
moment so pretty and so lucky I love
that
the taste is good but it's there it's
literally quite terrifying so we
finished out with some lunch and now
we're going for a little bit of a tour
on the streets of st. Tropez quite a lot
it's gonna be nice to just have a little
yeah it's so beautiful around here since
your day job a lot of times when I was
in Europe with the NGO based be a little
bit sad and nostalgic but we've stopped
because they found a cute little
alleyway and we're taking photos
everyone that was possibly a crazy troll
taking photos and filming ourselves we
must look so conceited
Dougy got very sweet of you
hello when we gonna love this
hey sorry I'm filming you I'm gonna go
have a look over here oh look he wanted
a Vespa shot look let's look did you
want your best for sure
okay so for the last hour or so I've
just been kind of editing kind of trying
to snooze kind of watching videos I have
no idea and honestly it's made me so
extremely exhausted I probably would
have been better just to have had a nap
and then woken up but I've been trying
to stay awake so that I don't it so
sleep well tonight I just sort of
refreshed my makeup it's a little bit
patchy
obviously I can't tell with this
blood-filled hurt but you just got
dressed for drinks tonight we're going
up and having a pool party on the roof
this is the dress
so it is day 2 and today we are getting
our morning with a morning hike we're
just walking around the streets and I'm
gonna have no idea where we but we just
had some brekkie
fruits which with the Alysha
and then I'll jog I forgot you today I'm
not sure
well that was interesting that was
literally so random we all thought we
were going like this easy walk on the
coastline and these trainers it make us
run and we were doing so it was so
bizarre I caught a little bit on camera
I think but yeah we're pretty much
running those and so I didn't really
feel much for you guys so I've just
gotten ready into just a nice little
casual outfit because we are having a
look at the new launches now and then
we're going for lunch down at the beach
so I just wanted to wear something quite
comfortable and casual I severely I drew
my lip yes I'm gonna head down to the
lobby now and bring you guys warm as
always by the way side note I have
emptied every single thing out of my
suitcase and put it somewhere in this
hotel room I have never made such a mess
in a hotel room and luckily I like I've
got time to pack up my bag but I am like
grossed out and I can really enjoyed it
myself
there's a mess that I've made they've
got to know how I've done this I'll show
you got stuff all over my bed look my am
my suitcase is pretty much empty because
it is all over here and then look at all
this makeup oh my god yeah that's my
makeup
yeah yeah that's what I'm doing my
husband
I'm learning about the new relations
with Cara
we are done there these makeup reveals
exponents if we had a lip tint which
will be coming out next year and now we
are off to have some lunch with
at the clarity debates in Japan they say
and look how beautiful the hotel is
that's Toto is saying it's just behind
me being given a tour in little colors
of course how cute is this this is the
car is crazy so small oh my god I love
it
I just ordered room service for my last
night cuz I'm just editing this video
now for you guys I look how yummy this
is hell yeah are you okay yeah I'm fine
been trying to go oh we haven't talked
in months
that's alright I was wondering if you
wanted to go for a try I just need some
fresh air and an old friend I'm so good
that we started talking again he'll turn
up a radio I love this song
remember when we used to stay up on that
long how's it been going
the worlds are so honest or so damn calm
if we stick on the highway we can do
some putting my wall picked up now I've
just got a few of this stuff to do and
I'm just gonna straighten my hair
because I always hate my hair gets on
planes and I feel like it gets naughty
when it's not straightened or like
styled if I keep my natural sort of semi
wavy hair it just kind of knocked up
other day and then I'm gonna go down at
11:30 now and the drivers pick me up at
12:00 so I might have a quick wonder
around the shops and get a coffee
what was he see at that time okay so I'm
all packed up and ready to go I have a
very long trip ahead of me and if you
watched my last vlog you yeah you would
have seen just how long it was so I've
decided I'm not going to include the
whole journey home in this log because
if you want to say what the trip is like
from Sydney to France coming all the way
across the other side of the world you
can watch that vlog I'll link it down
below but I feel like it'll just be very
repetitive so I just wanted to end the
vlog here not ready and not mentally
prepared to get on that log of a trip
again but at least I know that there's a
home stretch and I get to see Nick and
my family and my bag Bambi I've honestly
had the most amazing time and it's all
thanks to you guys I wouldn't be able to
do stuff like this if it wasn't for your
support following me on Instagram and
following my adventures on YouTube and
everything it's still blows my mind I
just started it's so random to me that
I'm a youtuber and it I just don't think
I'll ever get used to it and I just I
love it so much and I can't believe it
brings me opportunities like this so
lucky thank you guys so much like I'm
sure you know that I'm so so so grateful
so thank you and a massive thank you to
Clarence for sending me on this trip I
was the only Australian and I'm still
very confused why I'm doing the
Australian that was picked but I'm so so
flattered and yes I don't even know how
to express my gratitude I'm very very
grateful so yes I'm not very good at
getting my words I'm sorry if I just
repeated myself but yeah thank you guys
and thank you Karen's so yes I hope that
you guys have enjoyed this video and
make sure that you subscribe to my
channel if you want to and I will see
you in my next video bye guys bye
