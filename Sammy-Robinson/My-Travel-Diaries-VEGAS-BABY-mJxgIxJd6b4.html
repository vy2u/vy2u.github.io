we're get down to the pool yeah we have
a chance tonight and hey sounds good
can you walk out getting those options
please hope level pre-much to speak
Daisy's like interesting like I like
doing dad like recording like that he's
kids there's always fun anything that
you have struggle sideways find some
really interesting interesting angle
with like right now you look like you're
naked okay we're just walking having a
stroll down
not to show Alec I do we have an art
hello Marilyn
perfect people come to Vegas to party
we come to Vegas to 8:00 this morning
I've got an omelet I'm taking my
vitamins a coffee berries a very tan
Daisy so we've had a spray tan all right
so that's why I look quite tanned right
now but I'm actually just gonna do my
makeup right now we're just using the
setup that nas has created for us new
blushes I think these are the new
blushes or I don't know whether these
are just the ones that they've given us
first but we've got no this is orgasm
this is like nas is most popular blush
so I'm gonna use orgasm and go for like
a really flashy look today because
they've got the cream blush here and
orgasm as well so gonna do that and then
we're going downstairs get our hair
blow-dried gosh I'm so I look so orange
in this light because there's there's
I'll show you guys in the cover there's
these little orange you can't see these
ones here Orange so not have been so
amazing and I don't have to film a video
I don't have to vlog none of it is
sponsored none of it is required of me
but because they've been so thoughtful
for us on this trip and I've got to
bring Daisy I obviously want to try out
all that stuff on camera for you guys so
this is there I'm assuming this is all
their new collection because there's a
bunch of skincare in the bathroom for us
and it has the most beautiful packaging
I've ever seen it's like a pearlescent
or this dirty it feels really expensive
so I'm going to use this aqua gel
luminous oil-free moisturizer because I
want to keep my skin really moisturized
on here it's really dry weather but it's
gonna be like 30 degrees so I'm gonna be
sweating this I don't want something too
oily yeah
oh well that smells stubbing and feels
incredible and then this is the optimal
brightening concentrate and so it even
skin tone for a molding Mia's complexion
so she do she pumps of that unlike the
high points of my face and literally
just by coincidentally
foundation I brought this trip is this
guy here this is my favorite foundation
right now and her
been for a while since I used a camera
well this is my favorite more like
full-coverage foundation I use all my
light ones obviously like I use nice

day lightweight pull some pool basis but

wavelength and she's just so funny and I
just love her but thank you did the

bunch of friends and everyone that I met
was just incredible so thank you so much

tinge and like the slightest shame to
your lips alright I need my camera I was
gonna die so I'm on my phone now it's a
most amazing everyday just like light
tint to your lips because I've got quite
pale lip so it's just really natural and
beautiful all the orgasm blushes are
