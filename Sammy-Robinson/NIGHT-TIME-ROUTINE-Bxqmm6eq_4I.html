and you keep slacking
but it's not a sound
the tyranny the streets
and we can't get no
so you say
hello guys and welcome to my nighttime
routine so to begin I'm gonna show you
guys what I cook for dinner obviously I
don't make the same thing every night
but I thought I would show you guys what
I've been obsessing over lately so I've
been really really into roasting
vegetables at the moment I just think
it's so tasty
I've never cooked vegetables before in
my life we always ate really fresh
veggies but yeah I don't know I'm really
into the fruit of the moment so I'm
cutting some sweet potato some pumpkin
roasting some capsicum so I just spread
all the veggies out onto a baking tray
and then I like to drizzle over the top
of them with some olive oil just a
little bit just so that they're nice and
crispy and then I put some Himalayan sea
salt and some turmeric over the top as
well while that is cooking up a storm in
the oven I will move on to steaming my
veggies so I take some broccolini and I
put some onion in with the broccolini
just to give it some flavor and I just
love onion and I steamed that with some
coconut oil I really love the flavor of
coconut oil and it's really good for you
and it has lots of really good essential
fats to keep you fuller so then I'll
move on to making the salad so I do some
mixed Asian greens some rockets I have
some avocados this is sun-dried tomatoes
and I did on this day I never actually
have this I don't even remember what
it's called but it was in the fridge so
I put this in my salad and just some
fresh tomatoes as well because fresh
cherry tomatoes are my absolute favorite
they're just so tasty and really sweet
and then I like to add some cashews some
pumpkin seeds and some duhkha
for the flavor dukka dukka don't know
how to say this but yeah just add all of
that in then I put the broccolini and
the onion on top and then I like to add
some hummus
this was some spicy hummus on top I like
to what when I when it comes to adding
the veggies in later I like to mix that
all around it makes it really creamy
yummy salad dressing and so the salad is
prepped and all I have to do is wait for
my veggies to cook well oh wait I
generally will just go on my laptop
and finish the markup I like to sit by
the fire in winter I know it doesn't
look like it's winter cause I'm in a
singlet but we have twitter and
depending on the night I will eat by
myself by the fire
I'll ate with Nick I'll eat with my
family on the bench just have a really
chilled one or sometimes we'll light the
heaters outside and all eat together
when it's really nice at night after
dinner I always always have a sweet
tooth so I will cut myself some
strawberries and blueberries or whatever
fruit is in the fridge sometimes I have
some apple sometimes I have some banana
but in this case I had blueberries and
strawberries and I just mix all that
together and eat that and I always have
to have some chocolate as well I'm a
complete alcoholic so and then moving on
to my skincare routine I've been so
excited to show you guys this for so
long so I have a full face of foundation
on here and I know that a few of you
guys wanted me to do what I do when I
have a full face of makeup I will take
my clinic take the day off balm and I'll
rub that all over my face and then I'll
take a cloth generally this one is the
face halo by Chloe Murillo's brand and
it works really really well it just
takes every single hint of makeup of
your skin the best sometimes I do use my
cellar water and some cotton rounds if I
really want to take a full face of
makeup off I'll generally use a makeup
cloth that was me just showing you my
pale face don't mind it I had a bit of
fake to have on then I will move on to
this beautiful face kinds of glue and
very oversized of it it's by Peter
Thomas Roth and it's just a really nice
natural foaming face cleanser it makes
my face feel so clean but at the same
time it doesn't strip or my natural oils
some cleansers can make me feel really
dry or as this one cleans my skin so
well leaves my skin looking so shiny so
soft so the cleanser is a cucumber detox
cleanser basically a detox to the skin
and it removes all the impurities from
environmental pollutants now moving on
to the best new edition of my skincare
routine
Neutrogena has sent me their visibly
clear light therapy acne mask which is
basically a blue and red light which is
sort of targeted at killing any acne
under your skin I'm pretty blessed that
I have a naturally quite clear skin but
whenever I feel like I have
any breakouts happening on top of my
forehead I will always give this bad boy
a go blue light basically kills any acne
causing bacteria while the red light
reduces the inflammation the coolest
part about it is that the mask uses the
same technology offered by
dermatologists the mask is also at a
lower energy level which I really like
the idea of because I've got quite
sensitive skin and it allows me to use
the mask every day if I need it's also
super simple she's at home and means you
don't have to make the effort to go and
get a facial all the time and obviously
it's a fraction of the price and what
I've found from using this mask for the
last four weeks is that it really just
leaves my skin feeling super super
youthful I always find that no matter
what Kimble cream I use I will always
leave my skin super dry and flaky in the
area that it's treating or as if I feel
like my skin is breaking out or I'm
eating really badly I will always chuck
this mask on and leave it on for 10
minutes it's super easy it's super quick
and it just sort of kills any of the
bacteria underneath my skin without
having to put any intense creams over
the top but this winning combination
which is a serum and a moisturizer this
my friends is magic so I start off with
lay hendrickson sorry if I'm saying that
wrong but it's the invigorating night
transformation gel and let me tell you
this is definitely a transformation gel
I wake up in the morning and my skin is
just glowing I've never really been a
serum girl but now I am totally a serum
girl and then I finish off with the Olay
Henriksen shear transformation
perfecting moisturizers multi fruit
acids and antioxidants in it which just
makes my skin glow
I can recommend any skincare routine to
you guys it is definitely this one and
then I will finish off with my Burt's
Bees lip balm I have to have my lips
moisturized at all times and then that's
it so after I've taken all my makeup off
and feel fresh as a daisy I will check
on some comfy clothes and then go make
myself a tea I've been really loving
this planet organic peppermint tea
peppermint tea is really amazing after
dinner just to detoxify the body and it
helps aid in digestion so I loved having
one of these every single night and then
depending on what I feel like on the
night and who I'm with and what I'm
doing I will sometimes read at the
moment I'm reading the healthy life by
Jessica s'appelle and then on other
nights I will just continue to work if
I've got deadlines to come
and I feel like I've got too much
editing but this really does hurt my
eyes so I try not to do that too soon
before bed similarly I will sometimes
get my notepad out and write myself a
to-do list or maybe write myself a list
of videos I'd like to film this week and
things coming up in my life and then
I'll check my diary just to see what's
on for the week make sure everything is
going to plan nothing is clashing and
I'm feeling organized and then finally
I'll go and do my teeth I obviously
would have a shower as well but I didn't
want to feel myself in the shower I
would have done that before with my
skincare and then I will fling myself
out of my bed and cuddle up into my cozy
fluffy cushions before turning the light
off and going to sleep I hope you guys
have enjoyed this nighttime routine if
you did I'd love it if you could give it
a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already and I'll see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
