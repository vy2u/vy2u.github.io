days ago so I got a lot of new products
trying new makeup so it's just going to
be me experimenting with new makeup and
obviously on it
Oh on a day to day basis I wouldn't put
this many products on my face but
because I've got so many things to try
I'm just gonna load it all on my face
and see see what we can come up with
let's grab a snack and let's jump into
it start with the hourglass veil primer
of this primer and I'm going to be
trying out a foundation from hourglass
for the first time I suppose it's
probably best to use an hourglass primer
just to get the best effect because
often they like their primers and
foundations to work together you know
I'm going to try there al-abbas illusion
hyaluronic skin tint in the shade honey
so I don't really know how you're
supposed to apply it um it's a pretty
thick formula I think I'm just going to
spread it around my face and then use a
Beauty Blender to spread it out because
it says skin tone I'm assuming that it's
sort of like a tinted moisturizer I
don't know has hyaluronic acid in it so
let's begin for your skin okay so I'm
going to use a be blender and try to
blend that in this would be great for
sort of an everyday foundation because
one little layer just then was a very
natural finish but um I'm gonna try
build it up it's a really gloomy day
today outside um so it's not doing me
any favors for lighting it's not
providing me with any lighting I'm going
to use this Smashbox to do skin 24-hour
waterproof concealer in the shade light
neutral becoming one of my fave
concealers um oh my god that really is
quite right you guys have no idea what
your propped up on right now you're on
avars
a magazine a book my diary and
makeup case literally I've had a
nightmare my ring light and the stand
broke snapped our first luck we're
filming today but that's okay we're
making do and what are the cream
products do I have I have the naked skin
concealer in the shade dark natural this
is my favorite under-eye concealer but I
got the dark one to try out as a cream
contour because I've been really into
cream contouring at the moment this will
just bring a little bit of warmth back
into the face because that highlighting
shade was pretty intense now I'm going
to take my josie maran argan
enlightenment illuminating wand I've
been loving cream highlighters lately it
just looks so much more natural than
using powders I probably will be using
powders as well today because I did get
a lot of highlighting products overseas
but um yeah it's just a really really
natural way of putting highlighter on
because I personally don't really like
that like intense highlight that
everyone's going for I know it's a
massive trend at the moment to highlight
your cheekbones to the gods but um I
don't know I just I don't like it looks
good on other people but just not on me
I don't really like it on me this video
most definitely isn't going to be
natural though because I'm going to be
dumping a lot of products in my face but
there really are no rules with makeup
honestly at the end of the day it wipes
off and you can do what you want like
however you want to wear your makeup you
you do that because essentially it's
your face you can do whatever you want
to it and whatever you think looks good
go for it
I've actually been that loving and
baking at the moment I was so late on
the bandwagon with baking because
whenever I tried it it made my undereyes
really dry and wrinkly I hated it I
hated it using the laura mercier
translucent loose powder with a wet
sponge or a wet Beauty Blender is
amazing it makes your concealer so
flawless I dip it into the web MIDI
bundle
see you guys are saying baking before
and then you just set your under-eyes
with the powder I like to push it into
my skin a little bit as you guys know I
went to LA with mega Maximus oh I was so
lucky and a lot of these products I
received from those amazing companies
that I met but then I also bought a lot
of the products myself so because
obviously we can't get well we can't if
we use a shipping service but we can't
get a lot of the American products over
here because Australia is so far behind
we are so far behind everyone else when
it comes to receiving products so
probably my favorite thing that I got
from LA was from our glass and it's this
beautiful marble palette it's called the
ambient no it's called the lighting edit
in surreal light and it's the ambient
palette and basically it's got a powder
a bronzer a few blushes and then sort of
a strobing powder see like a highlighter
I'm going to take dim light which is the
powder just on the end here and set the
rest of my face so I'm going to take the
blush from this palette where is my
brush it's and use it as a blush clearly
put it on the apples of my cheeks X I'm
going to take my naked flushed palette
by urban decay it's in the shade strip
and it's got a blush highlight I'm a
bronzer so if you guys can hear noises
outside my window is open edge polished
shot it's as well gonna love the dogs
the dogs always have to make an
appearance ideas yes I'm going to take
the bronzer and just runs up the outer
perimeter of my face a little bit more
getting all this makeup has sort of
Rhian spired me to start doing a lot
make up on my channel obviously I've
been trying to include lots of different
things on my channel because I love
fashion so I've been doing hauls and
just blogging because I want you guys to
get to know me more so I feel the best
way for that to happen is to vlog and to
show you my life so I'm obviously I'm
trying to incorporate a bit of
everything but I mean I looked at my
channel and I haven't really done much
makeup for a long time since I went to
Europe the only thing I've done is my
everyday makeup tutorials but then I was
also with these amazing girls on this
trip and this amazing company and met
all these amazing people and it just
like we inspired me made me miss doing
makeup on my channel so yeah it's
something that I'm going to be
incorporating a lot more anyway moving
on let's highlight some more I got so
many new highlighters so I want to you
know just be myself in it
laura geller gilded honey highlight this
is like my ultimate perfect highlighter
because it's gold of just the golden the
really gold rich golden ones okay so now
that my skin is done I'm going to jump
on to my eyes so I've picked up the
toddler in bloom palette by Tarte
the master palette by Mario and the
lorac palette in unzipped which is just
a whole bunch of not móvil móvil pinks
today I'm going to use the tartlet in
the bloom palette going to start off
with smarty pants and use this as my
transition shade
so now I'm going to go into the master
palette by Mario Isabel I'm just going
to show you guys what I've been doing
for the last few weeks because I don't
my eyeshadow that often but when I do
this is the eye look I go for so now I'm
going to take the shade by a letter on a
little dome brush it's the luxe petit
crease brush from zoeva and I'm going to
carve out an outer corner and go above
my crease this will just like extend my
eyes but then also make them look bigger
because I have slightly hooded eyes so
like to draw above the crease and just
because I mean sogni Greece kind of
blending brush and just blend it all out
now I'm going to pick up marina which is
this top shade here Center right on the
center guy lid then you just want to
blend everything together no harsh lines
you know the drill
okay so next I'm going to try the still
a huge extreme lash mascara oh my god I
love it
this mascara freaking out the Stila
extreme lash mascara
literally in all right now all right so
I didn't get any new brow products but
I'm going to use my Ready Set brow or
clear as anyone elses gets stuck
together its Ready Set brow clear brow
getting jetting cell fan gel um I
haven't put anything in my brows and I
probably really should but I'm the
laziest person alive when it comes to
doing my brows I don't know why I just
brush them up and leave it like that I'm
going to try the Urban Decay D slick
makeup setting spray I've had the all
nighter setting spray before but never
tried the D slick one if the lips I'm
going to take my hourglass a lip liner

and then finally I'm going to take my
