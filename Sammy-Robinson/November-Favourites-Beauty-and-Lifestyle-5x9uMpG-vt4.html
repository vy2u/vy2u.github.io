today's video is a little bit different
because it's something that I've never
done before on my channel and it's going
to be a favorites video as you could
probably tell by the title down below
so I basically accumulated a whole lot
of products that I've decided are
definite favorites of mine that I want
to share them with you I either have
shared them with you in a makeup
tutorial I can't say that I'm going to
keep this up every month because I might
not necessarily have enough favorites in
a month but I definitely will start
making this a habit if I have lots of
new things to share with you guys if
that makes any sense oh this is actually
really exciting for you because
everything I have laid out in front of
me is like my ride-or-die at the moment
I don't even know where to begin to be
honest let's start with makeup products
now if you watch all my videos a few of
these products might not come as a
surprise but I thought I had to mention
them in ago I guess I'll start with my
still a huge extreme lash mascara I kind
of had like almost a first impression of
this in one of my videos recently and I
was blown away by how amazing this is I
do struggle with clumpy lashes every
mascara I use for some reason I can't
make them look separated but this one
didn't gave off enough product that it
oh my gosh I'm really bad to explain
things but it basically separated
lengthened and made my eyelashes super
black all at the same time and then it
did also offer volume if I added layers
of it I have it on at the moment but
then I also do have half lashes stuck on
the ends of my lashes so you can't
really tell but um absolutely favorite
so the next product I've also showed on
my channel before it's the Josie Maran
Argan enlightenment and luminizing wand
this is so so beautiful if you want a
really natural highlight and you guys
know if you can see you guys know me I'm
all about that natural makeup look
saying today why I've like lashes and
lipstick on but I really really am into
cream products at the moment and my
favorite thing about this is that obvi
about her formula this it's so easy to
blend I struggle with cream highlighters
in general because once you put it on
you have to blame
really quickly otherwise it just is
stark patches on your face but this one
the following there is so soft and so
blendable that it's just so easy to work
with it's foolproof and I am affordable
in summer I tend to stick to really
natural looks I don't really have that
much foundation if I'm wearing bronzer
I'll stick to a cream bronzer
like my clinic chubby stick and then if
I'm going to put a highlighter on I will
tend to stick with creams as well so I
just think it looks a lot more natural
and a lot more radiant on the skin
there's also any powders packed onto
your skin it looks just yeah it just
kind of looks like your skin another
layer of skin really speaking of
highlighters another favorite of mine is
the Stila star light star bright palette
now I got this when I was in LA and this
is incredible I don't touch this one
because that tends to look quite silvery
and Stark on me but these two here mix
together
a dream there are a lot of highlighters
out there that I really popular at the
moment that give you that really
glittery intense highlight that's what a
lot of people are achieving these days
as much as I think it looks amazing and
a lot of people it looks terrible on me
I have like I'm just quite hairy so I
have a hairy face and I don't like
putting too much powder and it's too
obvious when I go into the Sun you can
just see the makeup on my skin so this
one although it is a powder is so so
creamy like I when I feel it I can't I
can't believe that it feels ago feels
like a cushion and when you mix the two
together it makes the most beautiful
golden rose gold shade I can't really
show you swatches because I am quite
turned but god I'm so bad at swatches
yes this is another favorite highlighter
of mine at the moment because it is so
finely milled and it looks very natural
and for the girls out there that love
their bronzy highlighters like champagne
highlighters mix these two together and
it makes the most beautiful rose gold so
yeah these two highlighters are the bomb
calm further favorite makeup product of
length moment is the Smashbox always-on
liquid lipstick in stepping out this is
what is on my lips at moment
I've been wearing this in lots of my
blog my necklaces for I've been wearing
this in lots of my blogs I've been
wearing this all over my snapchat my
Instagram and I get so many questions
from you guys what's on my lips I'm
really into nude that are a little bit
brown and a little bit darker because it
really defines looks nicely definitely
more of a wintery shade so for those up
in the northern hemisphere this is going
to be great for fall I think it's a very
fall appropriately but I mean there's no
rules to makeup so you can wear it any
time of the year I always wear this when
I'm going out and going to an event and
things just to dress up my makeup look
now the last makeup product that I have
is this rodeo Instagram compact Deluxe
contouring powder in dark
oh that's mouthful it's a beautiful it's
a very heavy feeling compact
it's got leather there I think it would
I believe would be faux leather so it's
quite a different compact I find it I
haven't seen anything like this
but why I love this is you can see it's
very cool toned I've worn today for my
contour and I've been wearing for the
last since I got sent it I think I've
got sent it only about a week ago but
I've worn it every single day because
what I like to do is I to bronze up my
face something like Mac's give me Sun
which is a really warm tone bronzer and
that'll give you a really sunkissed look
but if you want to add that extra
dimension into your face I often will go
for something a little bit more cool
toned and I'll go directly under my
cheekbone just to give myself a little
bit more definition and so this is what
I've been using every small day for the
last week or when I've worn makeup and I
just think it's the most perfect contour
shade I had never heard of this brand it
was so random that I got sent it like I
said a whole bunch of their things but I
was like yeah I'll give it a go why not
I'm like obsessed with it I don't know I
just haven't seen a contour shade this
good also in case you guys are wondering
I am wearing shiny grimmons
SJ the label what she sent these to me
today she's just so cute her and John
sent me there's the white one the black
one and since like a cream one I don't
have any white or cream watch
so that was I was really nice lovely
I've had a send them to me so in case
you guys wondering that's what I'm
wearing it's extremely cool I had to
mention Frank body this I have used for
years like I have honestly used this
scrub since it came out I remember the
hype everyone got it and I was like what
is that and honestly guys until you try
this scrub you do not understand how
magical it is you scrub you put it you
scrub it onto your body and then you
leave it there for about five to ten
minutes then when you wash it off I'm
not even joking you feel like a seal
like you are so so soft so I have been
using this forever and this my habit is
empty I have a few more in my collection
but I definitely need to get some more
because I go through these like that
even Nick my boyfriend uses these he
thinks said the most amazing thing and
it makes your skin feel so soft every
time I use and he is like oh my god whoa
hello I would mention this because I
actually use this sometimes as an
exfoliator on my face I love taking some
of the coffee beads and I scrub it into
my face it's pretty rough so don't use
it too hard but you just lightly massage
it into your skin and then I leave it
there for the five minutes that I leave
on my body when you wash it off your
face will feel like a baby's bum that's
really creepy but you know what I mean
you will have the softest face you've
ever felt if you want a product that's
going to make your skin silky as hell
this is the product for you I use the
one at the moment in coconut so it
smells really smells really delicious I
had to mention my little memo book this
is the mecca memo book I don't even know
if this is the same but I use this book
for absolutely everything writing down
every little video idea I have all my
to-do lists all my ideas to film keeping
myself on track all my appointments all
my events keep everything in this one
and so I know what I'm doing and so I'm
organized because I've been loving
filming a lot more lately I really want
to stay on track but I find the best way
to do that is having it to do lists and
just like crossing enough that there's
nothing more satisfying than when you
have
to do list and at the end of the day you
can just like cross it all off it's the
best best feeling so okay so next I felt
it was necessary to mention this sarong
this is Malaya whenever I go to the
beach I have been completely into
wearing sarong so I love having pulled
out of my friends in summer so I don't
like walking around my bikini having my
butt hanging out I've got a massive
jiggly but to be honest so it's nice to
cover it up with the sarong and this is
so beautiful it's got the tassels on the
ends and yes so it's from Malaya and I
absolutely adore it so I need to get my
hands on a few more songs this summer I
think because I know I'm going to be
really into them as you guys know I've
been redecorating my flat and I've got a
whole heap of new home decor and new
sheets new cupboards new plants
everywhere so I thought it was necessary
for me to mention my favorite things
that I've picked up recently this is my
acquire candle in sweet pea and jasmine
oh my gosh the most beautiful sweet
fresh scent for summer so I like to I
like to go to the more vanilla a
stronger sense in winter but then when
it comes to summer I like fresh and my
tropical almost so that's my favorite
candle at the moment and then because I
was so obsessed with that scent I had to
pick up the diffuser version of it and
then a few of my other favorites s I
don't have my other one here at the
other day I picked up a few glass house
fragrances and this one is in the scent
Manhattan and oh my god it's so
beautiful this is quite a classy one
because it's more of a perfume flavor
I've been loving diffusers especially
because you guys know I have like a zoo
at my house I've got so many animals and
they're always so dirty especially
someone when I gets up a lot they want
to go swimming and has to have a candle
lit and a few diffusers in the house
each month I might have a different
fragrance that I'll show you guys
because I get scent fragrances quite
often so it's nice trying them out and
being able to share them with you
as you're ever looking for a fragrance
to buy um but I thought I would share
with you guys my all-time favorite
fragrance this is the one that I have
worn since year 9 probably so I've been
wearing it for years and years and years
I can't even tell you how many bottles
I've gone through like I kept a few just
in case I filmed an empties bottle but
um like I go through this like you
wouldn't believe
I had two more other than these as well
like I'm obsessed I mean I even have the
travel size version of it it is the
Michael Kors scent and I think it's just
the originalist but yeah in case any of
you are ever wondering what my scent is
um this is what I wear it's the Michael
Kors fragrance the micro cause fragrance
in the Rose radiant gold so it's in the
rose gold bottle it's a different scent
um I don't like it as much as the
original this is definitely my go-to but
this is still a beautiful alternative as
well yeah it's stunning I'm obsessed
with the Michael Kors collection of
perfume so you guys have to go smell
them and not to be creepy but when you
guys smell them
you'll pretty much be smelling me oh I
