forehead it's not too bad but the girls
from clinics or on my insta stories that
I had said that my pimples were getting
kind of bad and they gave me some
antipasto I'm keen to try that out
because all my stuff or my skincare that
I use generally is like hydrating glowy
stuff and I've never really bought or
taken things that are for blemishes it's
so funny I haven't known what to use but
I'm keen to give this a go and see if it
works so I've got lots of a little

my skin and I'll clear my skin on camera
with you guys like show you guys what I
do do is that I'm just drinking so much
water I'm drinking like 3 liters of
water a day every time I do have to do
makeup I take it pretty much straight
off as soon as I get home and I just
clean my skin and just moisturize just
so that it's not don't know why I just
just so that oils aren't getting in and
my hand dirty and it stays as clean as
possible so we'll see how this stuff
works it is in my skin is looking pale
but at mosque it just made my skin so
shiny and like clean this book and I
promise this is like in no way sponsored

this out on camera with you guys I'm
gonna use this anti blemish solutions
clinical clearing gel and then on top of
that to moisturizer me is my all-time
favorite my clinic Moisture Surge 72
hour whatever replenishing hydration it
is pouring outside
hi guys so I don't really know where
I've left off this blog um I've actually
just been spent the weekend in Melbourne
I guess um I had a good time and a bad
time and must I booked was just before I
left obviously didn't look there and so
it's Monday morning today I've just
gotten myself ready cuz I had to take a
few Instagram pictures and while I was
away hi amazing mother oh my god I just
don't know what I did to deserve her she
literally I mentioned to her briefly
that I was going I was thinking about
switching my room around so the bedroom
that I'm standing in right now just
found had the best lighting and I was
filming in here every time regardless so
I was like you know what I'm gonna
switch my office in my bedroom and bring
all my makeup and stuff in here make
this the office and
make the other room the bedroom and I
told her that and she knows how lazy I
am and she knows how messy I am as do
all of you so while I was awake for
three days she came over and by herself
she completely rearranged my rooms I
just can't believe it it's like it's as
if her motherly instincts knew I needed
a change and I needed a little bit of a
fresh start so I came home it's just
like so nice so I'll show you guys this
now knowing me as obviously I've already
messed everything up because I am messy
that's just me but basically this was
the bedroom and now look it's the office
so I've just got all my bags hanging up
here you walk in I've got two cupboards
here this is just full of hanging stuff
and like my gym gear but then she's
brought all my makeup drawers in which
are all okay and like my filing cabinet
and like my charges in camera gear is
all here she's put on to the side which
actually works really well then over on
this side I've still got my mirror
oh gosh well and all my belts and my
glasses are down here and I've got my
big chair and my table which is an
absolute pigsty which makes it perfect
because it means that the light is
coming in here I can film on my table
I've got a way better set up as opposed
to just sitting on my floor I've got an
actual chair my tripod and camera just
down here so I'll bring them up every
time I film dream big find wonder choose
love
give thanks smile often live simply be
kind to be grateful be happy be you
that's exactly what I need right now oh
nice to see and she's just the best mom
on the planet I just could not even
believe that she did this for me and
then so moving along up here oh I see
it's a bit messy I've got my suitcase
and stuff here but she's put my bed here
and obviously it's the morning so I
haven't made my bed yet but then along
here I've just got a bunch of my hanging
stuff some of my coats outside which I
probably won't show you in this corner
here just got like a little sitting area
and my plan
and then you look back out and there's
my cupboard and my little cabinet with
perfumes and stuff and I think it works
a lot better like this just so great
anyways I've got a bunch of work to do
the rest of the day just editing I
haven't edited this much of this vlog
for you guys I'm gonna do that and try
and get out by tonight but otherwise I'm
gonna go see days I've been hanging with
the girls just trying to keep myself
busy I've booked my flights to LA I'm
leaving to LA for Coachella but not
going to Coachella because I miss
Coachella because obviously I might
metal and so I'm gonna make a land and
then I go to LA so I'm watching doing a
photo shoot with something really
exciting I've got a little stuff going
