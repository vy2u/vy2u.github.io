window ledge copies turn cold
it's like front row there you pollution
flows in San Jose where my hair is
tragic right now but there is a reason
for that I'm going to show you guys
today how I flick my hair because I
always forget to do it just before my
video comes on and then I get so many
questions from you guys saying how do
you flick your hair and I feel a little
bit embarrassed to be honest to showing
you guys this because it is that simple
when I just put in that the beginning of
this video really quickly so I've washed
my hair is looking very long my hair but
um yeah like kinky and it's not straight
ahead style it necessarily I basically
just take a brush through my hair and
now I'm going to be using this little
brush from BBB &amp;amp; Co they've got
beautiful bamboo brushes with really
nice bristles and really great quality
brushes so I basically just had this
brush and I just draw a part down the
center bags and then I talk it'll why my
ears get a whole little bit soon and I
just pull it down and then I grab the
same hair brush and I brushed through
one more time I like to take these
elastics that look like they said sort
of clearly I basically just pull all my
hair until it fold like that and then
without trying I wrap it around
so in a bun so as you can see it's sort
of just like my body never did I can
never really achieve a good button but
that's not really what I'm going for I'm
more like having to flick hair I've been
using the Toni &amp;amp; Guy flexible hold
hairspray I just give a big spritz over
my hair and with my hands I kind of just
like flatten it down and that's that so
obviously it's not perfect I like it to
be just sort of as simple as possible
okay now that I've beaten a ton of
hairspray it's gonna eat an easter egg
okay so today's makeup we are going for
a promise like prom formal whatever you
call it here in Australia we call it a
formal um I know over in the US you guys
call it a problem I'm going to be doing
formal makeup so obviously gonna start
out with the moisturizer I've been using
the fresh Umbreon clay oil-free lotion
before makeup I'm testing out a lot of
new skincare at the moment I get a lot
of questions from you guys asking what's
going to I you so I'll let you guys know
about that if it turns out well but
definitely recommend Kate Somerville if
you guys are looking for a really good
skin care she is incredible I like to
really really prep the skin so I've
cleansed and exfoliated to make sure any
dead skin cells and excess dirt is off
your face because your foundation is
going to look the best on skin that is
really well prepped so I'm going to go
in with my NARS sheer glow in Syracuse
Saira coos not sure how to say it this
is a really old favorite of mine I've
just recently picked it up again so many
of you may know that this is my all-time
favorite foundation nas is just the
winner for me and I would definitely use
this on a night out but um for more
natural dewy skin like finish I would go
for the sheer glow using my Beauty
Blender I'm just going to blend that
into my skin this is a little dark for
my face that I'm sort of just matching
it to my neck okay so I totally forgot
to prime I've just realized if I was
praying I would use a pore filling
primer
feeling ones will make your skin look
much more flawless and we'll keep it
under Shannon longer and now with
concealer I have so many favorites my
favorites at the moment at Estee Lauder
Double Wear and heart shaped eights I'm
going to be using the NARS concealer in
the pot and it's in the shade lit
custard this is still very new to me I
can't really suggest this to you guys
yet but I'm just trying to figure out
whether I like it I love this concealer
for an everyday wear because it's so
lightweight you would think a pop
concealer would be so heavy but it's
actually super super lightweight I'm
going to be putting this concealer in my
t-zone as well so I'm maturing at my
nose and my forehead and then I'm just
going to pick the Beautyblender up and
blend that in again so now that I have
concealed I'm going to be taking my si
Lua cream highlighter in that champagne
glow and this is my favorite cream
highlighter at the moment is going to be
loose on all the high points of my face
I think cream highlighters just make you
look so healthy and Joey and I take the
la girl pro conceal in the shade
beautiful buns I'm just going to go in
sections so I'm going to place the
product and then take a brush and just
blend that in I think using cream
products is probably the most natural
option and I think it looks the nicest
on the skin and I'm gonna run a tiny bit
down the sides of my nose you only need
the smallest amount of this product
though because it's very very pigmented
and finally the cream products I'm going
to be taking my stealer blush this is in
the shade peony just a really gorgeous
neutral shade so I'm going to take my
finger and just put that on the apples
of my cheeks and blend upwards you don't
want to stay like this all night because
it will probably sweat off so we're
going to go in with some powder now I
like using the laura mercier translucent
powder and I like baking baking is a
very intense way of setting your makeup
you don't have to base you can just take
a brush and lightly set your whole face
but I like to get a wet Beauty Blender
into the translucent powder and to set
my under eyes this way with whatever is
left on the brush I leave given up I'll
go in and set
my eyelids as well I like to take a bit
more of that powder and just set my
t-zone you hopefully gonna be doing a
lot of dancing so this will just really
lock your to zone down in place if you
get quite oily probably my all-time
favorite palette is the master palette
by Mario and for me this just has the
perfect amount of neutrals in it so just
on a big fluffy brush I'm using the luxe
soft definer brush I'm going to be
dipping into Isabel which is this orange
shade just here I like to begin by just
running this ultimate crease so once the
transition shade is down we're now going
to drop into Zula which is this more
neutral than a transition shape are we
doing with this shade isn't as we're
placing it on the outer edge and then
also on the inner edge just beginning to
make the halo effect and then you can
physically sweep it together through the
crease so you're just want to keep
packing it on and blending it through so
then obviously every time you pack it on
you just want to take your blending
brush and just blend it all out so now
picking up fire letter we're going to
put that in exactly the same spot now we
pull all up
now taking your 5th Avenue we are going
to be packing that on the center about
eyelids so I'm going to take a flat
shader brush and pick up the product and
dispense it on the area that has no
eyeshadow and just keep blending until
everything is really nice and diffused
now we're going to be doing exactly the
same thing on the lower lash line so
we're going to be picking up Violetta
and running that really closely to the
lash line on a short shader brush and
then we're going to be picking up
Isabella to diffuse the dark Violetta
shade and then we can pick up Fifth
Avenue and place that on the middle of
the lower lash line and on the inner
tear ducts to make it all look seamless
we'll put some of that on the brow bone
as well now that all of our shadows are
done I'm just going to take my big
sloppy Russian swept away the rest of
the powders and now we're going to put
some of my clinic chubby lash mascara on
my lower lashes and I'll just do it like
a light coat on my top lashes as well
now once the eyebrows I'm going to be
I'm going to begin by brushing all my
eyebrow hairs up and I'm going to be
filling in my eyebrows using this
product so it's called precisely my brow
by benefit and I love it because it's a
really really thin little pencil it make
sure your brows really really easy
because it's so fine I just kind of hard
to make it a mistake so I begin by
tracing the underside of my brows and
then I like to draw a little fine lines
throughout my brows but I do like
defining them Inc is making them a
little darker and filling in any gaps
and that's what this pencil is grateful
because you can make little brush like
strokes throughout your brows and to set
my brows in place I'm going to be taking
at my 3d brow tones by benefit and it's
in the shade number two and I like to
just brush all my brows upwards this
just makes my hairs of a little bit
I do have quite dark eyebrow hairs and
it kind of makes it the same tone as my
hair I've moved you guys across a little
bit just because it's like sunnier over
here and it's like quite dark over here
I'm gonna be jumping into my little
color pop palette here this has just a
really nice bronzer shade and then a
really beautiful highlight so I'm going
to add a little bit more bronzer to the
other portions of my face just bronzing
it up a little and then I'm going to get
that glow with this highlighter I'll put
that all over my collarbone shoulders
and just it's a little extra on the high
points of my face as well finally how to
look I'm going to be picking up my
trusty hourglass panoramic lip liner in
the shade Eden this is just my favorite
all-time nude lip liner to finish off
the lips I've got two color pop shades
here I'm gonna make a little bit of an
ombre so I'm going to start off with the
cold color ultra satin lip in strict and
then on the center I'll be putting at
the colour-pop ultra matte lip in
naughty lastly I always love to put a
bit of my Evan k-chill or all-nighter or
any of the setting spray just makes me
really feel like I've locked in my
makeup so that's the finished look I
hope you guys have enjoyed the makeup
portion of this video I'm going to put
on a dress now for you guys this is the
most beautiful dress I've ever seen I
sort of matched my eyes to look a little
bit a little like this dress sister's
