in the Gold Coast
the girls are picked up from the airport
and we've just arrived sort of on the
10-yard wave hey we are just about to
walk into princess Holly HQ we're doing
some exciting filming for benefit and
princess Holly I did this last year and
it was so much fun as I'm so excited
about it so I'm here in the princess
Holly and we're about to launch the gala
for Nia I hope you guys like it
so today's video is super exciting
because I'm here in barely hairs in the
princess Holly HQ with benefit and
princess Holly
obviously and we are launching at the
new California blush which is incredible
I'll show you guys it is like Sunbeam
goddess heaven sent from heaven this is
the most stunning black I have ever seen
in my entire life it's bright pink with
the shimmering goals and it's just soft
so I don't use makeup books today which
is just a really pretty soft baby pink
luminous skin that look so try to see
how I get this look then just keep on
watching we're going to start off with
the professionals that we use its own
eye primer and you're using the center
of my face this will just sort of fill
in any pores and modify my face a little
bit
so now the second be Helen flawless
oxygen Wow Foundation and I have an
interface type of beige and I'm going to
put that all over my face so now I'm
going to set my face using the hello
flawless of benefit powder I may use the
shade champagne to set underneath my
eyes and use the shade honey for the
rest of my face I'll actually take a bit
of champagne on the center portions of
my face as well just to keep that nice
and bright too now with honey and a
bigger fluffy brush cetera
now I'm going to tech so precisely my
brow pencil in the shade number three
I'm the likely set of it through my
eyebrows just to give it a little bit
more definition I have a pretty cool
eyebrows as it is but this is just to
fill in any sparse areas so the reason I
love this pencil is because it sort of
just allows you to achieve a much more
natural spidery look as opposed to sort
of unfold around so now we set my
eyebrows in place I'm going to use the
Gimme brow in the shade number three I
like to brush my hair upward I like when
it's being a floppy brows so now I'm
going to take the high brow low and this
is just going to add a little bit more
definition but also give you that glow
underneath the eyebrow and I like you
just patting your outside
so now speaking the hoola bronzer by
benefit I love this bronzer and going to
take a big fluffy brush at first I'm
just going to run the outer corner of my
face now we took the same product and
use the brush that came with it this is
so good for contouring and I'm just
going to run a little bit of that
underneath my cheekbones this is like
add a little bit more definition and I
like to run a little bit of that size of
my nose as well now I'm going to take
the Watts up highlighter this is so so
good you guys it's a cream highlighter
and it's just got the most beautiful
champagne shade so creamy as well it's
so easy to use and I take a little bit
on my finger and just start put on all
the high points of my face so starting
with my cheekbones the reason I like to
use my finger is because it melts the
part into the skin really nicely with
the warmth of your finger I like to run
a little bit that on just above my
eyebrow arch as well just where the Sun
would naturally hit your face and down
the bridge of my nose
and I'm my unity duck and then I also
love spring on my table oh this will
give you the illusion or a singer look I
think that now for the star of the show
we're using the Californian plush which
is a new one from benefit how gorgeous
is that
so essentially what it is is like a
brightening and he's got shimmering
golden and activity as I moved around
the gold is it goes Buckley so I'm
pretty and it smells so good it's great
right and vanilla so I'm just going to
sort of twelve my brush around in there
some apples with my teeth I love how the
gold with the paint just makes it look
so luminous like as you can see we're
moving my changes so fresh and I love
that sort of glowy makeup look so I'm
definitely sad I'm so obsessed of how
that looks on my cakes I'm going to try
and put it on my eyes and see how that
look I'm just going to use it with my
finger and just make a good light blush
on my eyelid
Thank You redstone colors go really well
with light life as well it is obviously
opposite on the color spectrum so over
well my eyes I am going to take a
blending brush and sort of diffuse back
color so now for mascara take my very
real tinted primer and then use my
barrel mascara as well it is the best
combination ever
so now I'm going to take a little bit of
the benefit and I'm going to put these
on my lid and so just give a really nice
game and make it look doing that true
so that's the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed it I had so much fun
filming here today with the princess
Polly inventor team this block is
absolutely amazing if you just look it
up enough princess Polly and it'll be a
favorite for sure so thank you so much
to everyone at Francis pullian benefit
for having me here and I'll see you guys
in my next video
