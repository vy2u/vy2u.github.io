I'm holding onto my phone camera at the
moment because halfway through my Q&amp;amp;A my
camera died and then I went to plug the
camera back into the charger and it
won't charge it's just flashing bright
red so I'm gonna have to go get a new
charger I'll figure out how to fix that
but um anyway life goes on
so I'm now filming off my phone at the
moment um so yeah sorry the quality
changes up a little bit but anyway so
today I filmed a QA it does probably was
going to cut off really randomly at some
point in the video and then go back to
these because I'm gonna have to film my
outro but um before I do start um before
I switch over to the other camera the QA
person so I thought I would just mention
my Daniel Wellington discount code I
have um yeah so I have a discount code
with them from anything on their website
the code is Sammy 15 I'll leave it on
the screen I'll leave it down below I'll
leave all Daniel Ellington's links and
links to their website and everything
down below it's my absolute favorite
watch brand but Daniel items just so
simple and there's so many different
styles on their website so definitely
make sure to check that out and use that
code it's going to get a gift for your
boyfriend/girlfriend I just think it's
like watches are such an easy idea to
give it's gifts and it's like such
simple classic styles and Daniel Allen
yeah so yeah let's just jump straight
into the video I hope you guys enjoy it
and I'll see you soon bye
so today I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A I'm just
sitting on my bed today just because I
thought I'd do a change of scenery and
I'm just going to answer some questions
so it's just more of a laid-back video
so I asked you guys to ask me questions
on my Instagram and yeah so I asked you
to ask me sort of weird questions as
well oh do you guys to ask me sort of
some weird questions on Instagram just
sort of fun laid-back chill questions I
think too serious so let's just answer
the questions
if this laid-back that I'm literally
wearing my
pants and just sitting on my bed so
doing my my pajama pants they have like
animal patterns all over them so just
ignore that okay so first question is
what's my favorite breakup food um
probably I know this isn't everywhere
but my favorite personally is truckers
we have it's called char grill Charlie's
in Sumy I don't know if it's in other
states I think it's just in Sydney but
it's just basically that I guess and
it's like a chicken shop I just got the
chicken burger and chips and things it's
just so salty and delicious so that's my
favorite breakup food that's actually
just my favorite food in general really
would I ever be a model um I do little
things here and there probably not
really though I weigh too much food and
I don't think I'd be able to maintain my
figure very well if I were to be a model
I go full-time model do I normally eat
on a day-to-day basis on an everyday
basis I probably always eat sushi from
sushi train um truckers burgers always
have chocolate have chopped it every day
um avocado on toast for breakfast
my favorite things do I like pineapples
yes my full name Samantha Jade and the
Stasia Robinson when I was younger what
was my dream job um my dream job was to
be an ice cream scooper so just kidding
scoop ice cream at an ice cream shuttle
a lobster's mermaids two scorpions um I
guess so if you could look at it like
that they'll be pretty cool hey um
what's my weirdest habits
I really have habits as in actions or
anything but I say things like every
time I make a point alloys and with you
know like selling my point you know you
know um or like my friend Millie she
always says um surely not and so now I
have I picked up a habit and everything
I go surely not surely not surely not
it's cause I made someone tall um as I
whenever I meet someone new did
say well wow you're tall yes every
single time that's the first comment if
that if they've just met me that's the
first comment they'll make is while
you're talking I'm just under six feet
tall so if I were to get a tattoo what
would it be I would probably get some I
probably wouldn't unless it was really
meaningful but I have nothing meaningful
at the moment to get so I probably just
get like a smiley face on my bum or
something silly what color is a brown
bear um
I think brown bears blue mm-hmm
my friend Holly who's who is Jared I had
no idea what you're talking about
um did my helix piercing hurt yes it
hurts so much because I got to at the
same time so I have the top one and um
the ring below it so it was just like
super super tender when I got them both
done would I go brunette yep probably
have a beard or hairy chest um
yeah neither a hairy chest and then I
would just get it like laser hair
removal whereas I'd hate to have a beard
and have to shave the beard so I'd get a
hairy chest and then get that laser
removal ASAP do I like being tall yeah I
love being till I hated it when I was
younger because I was so much taller
than everyone else
um now as I'm older I've loved it I love
being tall but flower

traveled um so far from where I've
traveled my favorite would be um Lee
