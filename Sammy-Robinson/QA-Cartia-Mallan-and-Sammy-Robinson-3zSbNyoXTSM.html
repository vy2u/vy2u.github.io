wonderful whatever um okay hi guys I
know we do this every time
times hi guys oh my god oh my god ah hi
guys welcome back to my channel I'm
joined with Caillou Mahalo again and
today we are just filming a Q&amp;amp;A we took
to my Instagram and you guys have left a
lot of questions so a lot of questions
that let's just jump straight into it
then how long have we been friends for I
can't remember actually almost a year
almost this time last year was when I
was coming down to Sydney he's been
staying with it yeah because it was like
last oh yeah it was like last October
no it was like last Christmas Eve I'm so
last trauma yeah last summer so it's
literally almost a year now which is so
weird yeah that it's it I just know in
this video I'm gonna be playing with my
hair and non-stop you have to stop me if
I did I'm just gonna be like flipping it
no ever boys alright hey number 2
what's your what's our favorite thing
about each other we enter this last
night or like sitting there um I can
lipstick color by the way what is that
is it mine too babe um oh my gosh my
favorite thing about Sammy
hmm I don't know like it's such a silly
question kind of narrowed down to one if
I'm if we're going every single
attribute oh oh yes and I love Sammy's
eyes and lips I just love it
face and butt my butt all-time favorite
perfume um I went to like my all-time
but it's my like drove through this
black opium by Yves Saint Laurent
mine is just Michael cause it's the
original is the girls line it's just the
original line of course I've won it for
like four years now
eight bottles yeah
what are our religious beliefs okay well
I'm a Catholic so I was kind of raised
going to church every soft and I go and
Christmas is like most of the time I
believe that there's something out there
but I'm just not not sure what my yeah
literally exactly same Catholic getting
yeah don't believe in like God per se
but like but I don't know I don't know
yeah it's just like I'm like Rosanna
wasps what's that oh wow
what was I ready to just oh yeah yeah
doing the tradition together so our
tradition would be most of the time we
see our friends Angus Henry and my
boyfriend Nick and we just go for dinner
or we like we're always we always just
randomly do some we do something with
them we get acai bowls in the morning
acai bowls and coffee decipher from the
same place right girl fresh blood fresh
lime Mossman we also just like hanging
out just kissing and cuddling like
normal couples daily then so the next
question is how did you guys meet
um well we just met through a few of the
youtubers we just know I got little you
to belong yeah we just had like a little
lunch in Sydney and it was probably one
of the times that you just like you came
to Sydney it was in period where she
started coming to Sydney for like a
little while yeah I was here a lot more
often yeah a bigger place in Sydney
you don't need focus no I mean I know so
many you should sing mix Instagram
people I was only back by John
you guys want to know what
beggars day at my boyfriend um what are
you going to avocados toppings oh good
one
mine would be if I was to make it myself
I put avocado feta maybe some onion um
and some balsamic glaze good jack good
yeah me the eyes would you do that and I
I'm supposed to hold mine but sometimes
like if I was having like a simple one
if I make a wish
yeah sorry if I'm just doing if I'm just
making it myself
I just put um salt pepper and lemon and
then if I want to like spice up more I
have like nutritional yeast stuff which
is just like it's like flaky powder it's
like it's like a cheese tasting thing
right it's like soyoung's it's like kind
of crunchy texture and um yeah and
sometimes when I do that and then put
basil on top and it's just like so yeah
yeah um the reason both of you guys
started YouTube with immediate and my
juice at YouTube um I started YouTube
because I knew I was eventually gonna
make card even I did it all for me
alfred love Brad it was literally ready
it was raining I put it on my camera on
a stack of books and I filmed myself
doing my makeup me and then it just
really it worked up it is why I quickly
for me yeah yeah to keep you loved it so
I went out just happens like that was
mind I'm like I don't know why I started
and why I did it I just did it and then
I say but why did you the second one and
I was like look that's more questionable
than the first one
my makeup I literally hate it like it
was a way it went for me sinus issues um
how do you want kids and are you Joe
like for kids yeah we have four I could
really have liked to like I don't know
like our two would be perfect yeah if I
had a boy and girl would be perfect but
if I you want good fan fold the fan
metal fork so I'm in a family of four
kids and about eight animals and I just
love it it's like a zoo
yeah it is have fun it's always fun is
so fun yeah yeah I want kids but like
once I've kind of done everything I want
to do type of thing like I'm not a
person that would like wants to settle
down any time soon and have Alan and
Miriam not anytime soon
no no no right how do you stand wait box
ah oh really
Oh George that's his brother Oh Simon I
just don't I put a collar on him at all
time
I bring a leash with me i lock him in
his cage right now so that he doesn't
and so that he doesn't do anything
erratic no erratic behavior Thanks and I
come back so I'm just like 200
everything ready
I hate all favourite places to shop for
clothes online as Polly whitefox
boutique sorry I sauce I love ordering a
face that's gonna come really fast miss
lagging misguided I really shopped from
anything mom I'm filming you can't talk
mom oh yeah which do you work out and
have a healthy diet plan I probably get
one of my most commonly asked questions
I need my commonly asked requests on my
youtube channel these days is to do a
workout routine but um I don't work out
it's really bad I have I don't I I
really walk I might go for like a half
an hour walk four times please when I
feel this blessed up with the eye pockit
tableau I dry it healthily
I don't eat that helpfully look if I'm
still hungry later I'm gonna get my
hands rotisserie ovens and that
that's why every night though if I if my
do doesn't fill me up
I will go to Mackey's drive-thru and I
almost sometimes subconsciously don't
finish my dinner
so like yes I'm like I'm tall is fine
then it gets like 10 p.m. I'm like Nick
drive-thru I don't have a diet plan or
an exercise plan but I try and work out
like at least three times a week yeah
and I yeah I eat super healthy I'm not
like a bit I don't eat fast food or
anything
oh I'm following up with this question
you're shocking this guy not it looks so
good what am i doing right now go power
yeah the question was how do you stay
focused not focus on boys wait how do
you stay focused on yourself and not
think about boys literally cuz I can be
a little boy sometime mm-hmm like I just
like male energy around me cuz I got two
girlfriends so but mine is like really
just yeah focus on work and like what
are my goals and like what do I want to
do for myself and then I feel like yeah
the other stuff comes like it's really
not a priority when you think about how
young you aren't like it's just not LLL
come and when it's right or come like
there's no point like being like I need
this I need to get male attention and
swim dolphins well so we finished the QA
it's just a quick short one because is
it going to end on you doing this like a
non-stop now liking so much guys for
answering not answering we are asking
