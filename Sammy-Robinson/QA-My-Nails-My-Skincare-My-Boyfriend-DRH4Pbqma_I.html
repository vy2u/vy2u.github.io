you so much for watching today I filmed
a wall tonight so dark tonight
I filmed a Q&amp;amp;A so I Q&amp;amp;A so I filmed a
Q&amp;amp;A I went to my snapchat and I asked
you guys what you wanted to say if you
have you said QA so I then said if you
want me to do a Q&amp;amp;A ask me some
questions and a lot of you sent me
through questions so I'm just going to
answer them now and hopefully you guys
will enjoy and I'll see you guys next
time the first question I got was can
you please do a video all about your
nails so that's a very very common
question well like requests that I get
is all about my nails um I have a very
specific way of doing my nails in the
color I use I mean I changed up here and
there but I always go back to the same
one eventually so I thought that that
would be kind of a good idea to include
a bit of an info session about my nails
if you will um in this video so briefly
touch on what I get done so I used to
get acrylics done and they were always
really thick and they always made my
skin go I really a little bit sore on
the outside so I think I was a little
bit allergic to acrylic nails or just
didn't sit well with me didn't sit well
with my fingers so I've since changed to
SNS it's a much thinner form of sort of
the same concept as acrylic but it's a
powder so they paint on an SNS sort of
nail polish and then they dip your
finger into a powder and then they paint
it again tip it into some powder and
then you just get left with a really
nice thin sort of nail so yeah it's the
same concept as acrylic nails you can
get long nails you can get them as thick
as you want sort of thing but I like my
nails really thin so that's why ICS
works really well for me and now in
regards to the color I often wear this
color and that's probably the most
common ask question is um is about the
color of these nails so I get funny
bunny from OPI it's just a Polish people
think that I often am
Sherlock over acrylic but no it's um
it's just a polish it's just funny buddy
from OPI and in regards to the shape I
guess they kind of called ballerina so
they go um as if they're going to be
round and then you chop off the top so
it's kind of like a ballerina slipper I
guess I don't know it so that's all I'm
gonna answer that my nails because I
don't know what else to answer because
it's a broad question can you do a video
all about your nails and I thought it
would be a bit ridiculous to do a whole
video just about my nails so yeah there
you go
so the next question was how do you keep
your skin so clear so I guess I am very
lucky because I was born with naturally
very healthy skin and it's just a
hereditary thing I actually just have
healthy skin because of my relatives and
because my mum and dad have healthy skin
and very clear skin so I never had the
acne problem because I guess it's a
hereditary thing but I do use a lot of
skincare that I love so I'm going to
dedicate a whole video on skin care
because I love skin care and I really
want to talk all about it but I guess a
few products that I can recommend right
now for really soft baby like skin
before you put your foundation on is I
use um it's probably could be wrong as
well like I'm not an expert on this
topic and so it's kind of weird for me
to be like this is what you should do
because I'm not qualified or anything
but what I do personally and it just
works well for me is before I wear
makeup or three or four times a week not
every single day I will scrub my skin
with Frank body it's a it's a coffee
scrub and it's meant for your body but
it leaves your my face so so soft and it
gets rid of any drive skin or flaky skin
on your face um I'll just quickly tell
you the process of what I do and then
I'll describe it in more detail
and show you how I do it I guess in a
skincare video so I go in first with my
shoe amaura face cleansing oil so I
don't use a cleansing soap I use a
cleansing oil and I wet my hands and I
use the oil onto my dry skin and that
goes sort of all the makeup on my skin
then I go in with ah it's hard it's hard
to say because I do use different
products but I then go at the moment
what I'm going in with is it's called
purity I think it's from Mecca I don't
know I'll have to check it I'll put in
the downbar below but then I put that on
my face and then I use my Clarisonic and
I do the minute of kind of sorting on my
face just to get rid of any excess
makeup on my face then I'll go in with
my Frank body scrubs to exfoliate my
skin and make sure I get rid of all the
dead flakes on my skin and then I go in
with a skin tone so that's for it's kind
of like an anti-aging thing but also
keep your paws nice and tight and make
sure that your skin has sort of an even
texture then I go in with my moisturiser
which I've shown in one of my videos but
it's just the juice stem cellular
moisturizer it has the little button on
the top so it comes out the top so it's
really good for people with nails like
me where you'd want to dig your
fingernail in there um I then often
spray my face okay I then often sprayed
my face with something because it's so
refreshing and honestly feel makes me
feel like I've left my face super super
super moisturized and this is honestly
what makes me feel so soft is when I use
a face spray all going to be in a
different separate video I'm going to do
a whole process of my skincare and show
you how I do everything so I'm not going
to go too in depth into that but that
was just kind of an over view sort of
brief over my skincare and how I keep my
skin so soft and so hopefully that
answers that question
alright so next question is oh it good
oh yeah how did me and my boyfriend meet
so this is a pretty funny story actually
we met at study camp which is kind of
embarrassing but study camp is basically
for people in Sydney I know it's in
other states as well but during your HSC
which is your last year of school you um
go to a camp I guess for a week and you
just study so for people like me and my
friend Daisy we weren't very good at
studying by ourselves at home so we
wanted to get away somewhere and where
we could concentrate and just study and
think about nothing else
for me it meant that I found a boy that
I had a crush on so I got nothing done
which is Lucas he's now my work anymore
no regrets cuz even though I got nothing
done I met him which was cute um but yes
so we met there and at first we didn't
really have a crush I had a crush on him
but I don't think he had a crush on me
and yeah so we kind of just became
friends and texted and then went out now
we've been going out for about a year
and a half well we've been together like
not officially but we've been together
for about just every year a year and a
half somewhere around there but yeah
pretty funny next question is what am i
studying at uni so I'm I'm at UTS in
Sydney and I'm studying public
communications um it's a Bachelor of
Arts in public communications or
something like that but it's a really
good um it's a really good course for me
because if I want to be in PR and
advertising and all that sort of stuff
and it's got me into a really great
internship which involves like top
bloggers in Australia such as Lauren
Curtis and Chloe Morello um I'm obsessed
with Chloe Murillo so I'm like hey girl
I wish anyway anyway so it's given me
the opportunity to work in a really
amazing place like that so that's max
characters and it also helps me out
because I kind of work around people I
don't work with them but I'm just
learning about the blowing industry with
Lauren and Chloe and watching their
stats or everything so it's actually
helping me out in my youtube channel as
well so it's all coinciding really well
for me at the moment um so I have the
intern
ship YouTube channel and my degree in
public communications which all works
really well together and that's kind of
where I want my future to go not
necessarily YouTube but in the PR sort
of industry over there and then I also
have my separate jobs as a bartender
slash waitress in a pub and I'm a coach
so of those two jobs as well and yeah so
next question what are the three things
I wish to achieve now and in the future
that's a pretty cool question so three
things I want to achieve now is I would
love for my YouTube to sort of take off
and that would be so cool to watch um I
would I will stick in this internship
that I met and be involved in max
connectors and I want to finish my
degree and you have that public
communications degree in the future I
have no idea I really am just going to
see where life takes me to go um I guess
in the future I'd love to be married and
have kids um
I want like four or five kids I hope I'm
in a family um for kids and I love
having heaps of people around all the
time so I would love for my children to
have lots of siblings around um yeah so
I guess be married have kids and be
happy that's all I wanted the future
next question do I live by myself
um so yes I know
I live on a flat on top of my house
which my family lives in so when we
bought this house there was a flat which
was separated from the house separate
electricity bill everything like that so
I live up in the flat which is
completely disconnected to the
downstairs but we put a staircase inside
of our house that I can get down into
the house through um so yes I guess I do
live by myself but I am lucky because I
get the best of both
I get to live at home but I get by also
by myself that makes sense
what town do I use
I am I go to I don't go to I use
saint-tropez so I use that in the mousse
formula and it's an ultra dark so yes
what is my ethnicity I always get asked
to this I literally people random people
come up to me on the street and always
ask me what my ethnicity is or but I'm
working at the pub people always like
where are you from I'm like I'm just
Australian and English like I don't
actually have anything that's really
unique or special about my ethnicity
really all I am is just a stray lien and
English and Irish yeah so the next
question I haven't said your names I've
been reading um your snapchats but I
haven't been saying your names because I
don't know if you don't want to be said
I don't know if you want to be shared or
you know what I mean
I don't haven't said your names because
I don't know if you want me to say your
names and I didn't say that before the
video so I'm just I'm just reading the
snapchats as I go what skin products do
I use um yeah I've answered that one as
well so yeah what area in Sydney do you
live and are you married yeah i don''t
specify exactly where I live I live in
the sort of North Shore area
um but yeah so I live sort of in the
middle of the city and the Northern
Beaches area yep
am I married ah no I'm not married I
love that that was such an unexpected
question um no I'm not married I am 19
years old so I hope not to be married to
about 27 so hopefully just less than a
decade I'm married I'm not going to put
a timer on it though just saying I don't
want to be married for a while yet and
when did I start my youtube channel I
started about three months ago I think
um so yeah um
March I think yeah I think March
let's go with March and why did I start
it um god I am such a random but I
remember talking to my friend Laura and
she loves ug candles and literature
she loves YouTube videos and she sort of
introduced me to it um her and my friend
Holly and I hadn't watched anyone before
and then I guess I sort of started
watching them and I was like this is
cool like you can really like learn
things from others and I don't know I
just thought it was so awesome that you
could just watch other people do their
makeup and learn different techniques
and styles and get inspiration from
people so I wanted to sort of share my
knowledge of makeup and my experiences
and so that's the last question I have
for now I have they keep coming through
so I just have to stop other maybe too
long so let me know if you did like this
Q&amp;amp;A and I'll definitely feel more if you
did like it um leave comments down below
and I will answer them next time I film
one so I'll go back to this video and
answer the questions that you guys leave
if you have any um yeah so I'm not going
to say anything much else because this
video is going to be so long so I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure
you give your thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel and I have nothing else to
say except I hope you guys have a
wonderful day and I'll see you in my
