you so much for watching today I'm
filming a Q&amp;amp;A so I talked to my
Instagram and I asked you guys to ask me
some questions and so yeah I'm just
going to answer some questions H or big
city I think it depends on the seasons
for me in summer I would 100% prefer to
be at the beach but in winter there's
nothing really to do at the beach so
you'd want to go to the city and sort of
go to restaurants and go shopping and
things so am I allowed to answer both
but different season what does what does
my last text message say I'll get it up
oh that's embarrassing I can't say it oh
I was texting my friend Emma about a boy
but tea or coffee are probably coffee
actually no I take that back I could
drink I could go without coffee I I
would I'd want to be able to drink tea
now I take that back again I'll go get
coffee
what footy team do I go for um I'm just
gonna assume that means AFL or I'm just
gonna aren't AFL exciting really support
any other footy teams um I originally
went for Geelong because I was born in
Melbourne and my whole family was a long
supporters but since my brother plays in
the Swans I probably have to say that I
would go for this one ease so yeah
Christmas or Easter definitely Christmas
because on Christmas you can eat as much
chocolate as you can on Easter so
definitely Christmas I'm absolutely I'm
absolutely obsessed with Christmas
what's my favorite season um spring or
summer I love spring because it's not
too hot but it's still sunny but I'm
definitely a summer girl look what do
you want to do as a career um I have
absolutely no idea I wanted to be in PR
and advertising
in that sort of area I really I wanted
to be a fashion buyer but then I sort of
switched to PR and now I have my youtube
channel I that's kind of what's going
for me at the moment
but I'm still doing my public
communications degree and I guess we'll
see where I go from there
it's just so open or it's so up in the
air for me at the moment so I'm not sure
but everything really relates my degree
my YouTube channel like just all of it
sort of is coinciding and going in the
same direction so hopefully we'll just
end up working out I do I work out know
I am so bad I don't exercise like ever I
used to be very sporty so the school I
played a lot of basketball a lot of
netball a lot of sports was always
playing sports but since I've left
school I haven't been playing sports and
that was my exercise so I have to go to
the gym or I have to figure out some
sort of sort of replacement for my
sports do I use loving tan um yeah I
have loving tan on at the moment uh but
a lot of people ask me how I get so dark
and I'm actually naturally very tanned
so I'll go out in the Sun and I'll get
quite ten and then I might put a little
bit of fake town over the top of it and
that's kind of how I get so dark so it's
not it's loving town is an amazing
amazing town and it makes you really
really dark but I don't use too much of
it um but yeah I would go with that town
if you wanted the darkest possible turn
or sometimes I even mix my saint-tropez
moves with my loving tan that makes it
really nice color so that's a more
expensive alternative but I used to use
um saint-tropez well I still use it I
switch up but yeah so I kind of mix them
sometimes just because I have both of
them but yeah loving town or
saint-tropez is definitely my favorite
tans my friend busy said will you go out
with me
yes I will go out with you what you
would never all skip do I have dry or
oily skin I have combination skin really
I don't have dry skin I don't have oily
skin I have just sort of normal skin but
I mean
get oily and I can get dry so yeah I'm
not I'm not towards one or the other I'm
I'm very I just have very normal skin
what's my favorite foundation probably
the NARS sheer glow foundation or the
NARS all day when I'm all day luminous
weightless foundation am I going out
with anyone no I'm single
what money get Jay get what subjects did
I study at school I studied um advanced
English extension English one just like
general masks I was shocking it general
I mean shocking it max there is a fly in
here so yeah I studied advanced English
extension English one general maths
because I was shocking um Italian modern
history and art yeah what's my favorite
lip products I would say max velvet
teddy and Max lip liners in well and saw
or NAS lipstick in Pigalle if you could
have any exotic or common city animal
has a pet what what would it be some
sort of huge cat if I could have any
exotic animal I would love to raise a
tiger or like a leopard and I some sort
of cat I love cats I think they're so
majestic but I love the Bengal cats as
well there the huge version of just
normal house cats and big cats um
but yet if I could choose which cat I
would go tiger if you could have any
celebrity boyfriend who would it be if I
could have any celebrity boyfriend
celebrity boyfriend yeah probably
Channing Tatum I'd probably go Channing
Tatum any insecurities or do I wish I
could change anything about myself um
everyone has insecurities I definitely
have insecurities I mean I'm a curvy
girl so sometimes I look at skinny
bodies and I think oh my gosh I'd love
to have those skinny legs but then other
days I absolutely love having a big
bottom figure just bigger features I
guess we go really I have stretch marks
I have cellulite so I had like it's not
really I'm not really insecure about it
though I'm I'm I'm pretty accepting of
it but yeah if I could say any
insecurities would probably be just
sometimes I think like any girl you just
get insecure a bit about your body but
yeah so you just have to learn to love
yourself for who you are because there's
no one else like you except in my case
cuz I looks like like Judy had it with
her Hadid
I got in so much trouble for calling
coach hey Gigi handed in my last video
everyone was like it's Gigi Hadid I was
like okay if I could be an animal what
would happen um I would be a tiger I
used to think I was tiger so I guess I
wish I was a tiger
my favorite people I watch on YouTube
definitely desi Perkins I love her she's
absolutely beautiful
Shen ik so um I haven't watched any
YouTube for a while actually
I think SHINee grimmons super cute I
think we'd go along I love her
personality um
and of course Ronnie and
if I want to dye my hair what color
would it be I would go like quite a dark
brown I've been really wanting I've been
actually thinking about going quite a
dark brown I won't do it because it's
just someone here in Australia right now
my hair will just lighten up naturally
anyway if I do that but um yeah so I
would probably if I was to dye my hair
go like a dark brown and final question
how do I deal with hate I mean when I
started this YouTube channel I was very
aware that I was going to get hate and
there was hate involved in it because
people just like to hate sometimes but
yeah so I was very aware of it and I'm
not going to let it get to me because
there's nothing I can do about Who I am
I am Who I am and if people don't like
it they don't have to watch me but yeah
I mean hate doesn't bother me too much
I haven't had very much hate but well at
least not to my face or in my comments
but yeah no I I wouldn't let it get to
me anyway because people can be jealous
and people who blatantly hate on other
people just actually end up tearing
themselves down and they just look like
spiteful people and it's very
unattractive trait to me so yeah so I
don't like hating on people I don't like
being rude and things like that because
it just reflects badly on yourself to be
honest so yeah I don't look at it like a
reflection on me if someone says I look
silly or whatever then I just say well
that's okay because I like how I look
wearing this door I like do to do my
makeup like that and if you don't like
that that's right but you look a bit
ridiculous being so hateful so yeah um
yeah so so that's the end of the Q&amp;amp;A I
hope you guys enjoyed it and also let me
know in the comments if you want to see
more videos like these and more vlogs
and things like that because I love
filming them so I would love to see if
you guys want to see them otherwise
otherwise I have nothing else to say and
except I will see you in my next video
and I hope you have a lovely day hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
