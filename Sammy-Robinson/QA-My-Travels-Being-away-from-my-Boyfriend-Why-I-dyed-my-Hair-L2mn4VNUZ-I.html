today is the first video that I'm
actually sitting down and filming and
I've been away I haven't sat down and
filmed a video in I've been about three
months since I've filmed a video which
is so weird it's good strange to be
sitting down right now
filming but I missed it
let me just move that so today I'm going
to be filming a Q&amp;amp;A I took to my
Instagram and asked you guys to ask me
questions all about my trip to Europe
all about anything really so I'm going
to scroll to the top and just go down
and ask sort of the most comp answer
sort of the most commonly asked
questions and just so that you guys know
where I went just so that were all up to
date I went um I went away to Europe for
two months and we started in Amsterdam
then we went to Berlin Prague Rome
Florence Cinque Terre nice in France
Barcelona Croatia we did sell Croatia
and then we did ultra which is a music
festival in Croatia and then we ended in
Greece and we did make another Santorini
adios
so those are the places we went in case
any of you are wondering and I went away
with two of my best friend's Daisy and
Holly and we started with another one of
our best friend Laura but she went home
early so that's sort of like the quick
rundown of my trip all of you guys asked
me where my favorite place to go was in
Europe I would have to say either Greece
or Amsterdam
so one city that I loved was definitely
abstinence the first place that we went
it was just such a cool place to go to
and then my
sort of beachy place was definitely
Greece so a lot of you guys asked where
me and Nick actually met we met through
our friend Angus I worked with Aeneas at
a pub and Nicky's and his friend from
school so I like made Angus give me
Nick's number and we just started to
because I saw that Nick was in what I
think is as photos and I was like damn
that guy's cute yeah so we just started
texting when asked am i still purchasing
the G and yes I will be I'll be
purchasing that very soon just within
the next few weeks very exciting what
made me want to dye my hair in the where
was I nice so like halfway through the
trip I my hair just from the SUP the
European Sun just went like white it
just went so white and my skin started
getting so so brown and it just looked
so it just looked terrible on me so I
went into a hairdresser in Nice and I
asked him to dye it sort of a honey
blonde just go just a darker blonde and
he didn't speak very good English and
obviously misunderstood me so he died it
sort of it a dark blonde light brown
however you would describe it so it was
completely accidental but I actually
really in light hour ended up turning
out so then for the rest of the trip it
went quite honey blonde again which I
liked I originally wanted to go honey
blonde um but because I cuz I liked the
accidental brown I thought when I go
back to Sydney I would die Brannigan's
um so I'll see how it goes but otherwise
I might put like a bit bit of lightness
to the ends
making a little bit bell Yosh so yeah if
you guys are wondering where I go to get
my hair done
I go to cough hair Barton Mossman I was
leaving my boyfriend to go traveling was
it difficult if I'm being honest I
definitely did struggle was kind of
unfortunate timing that we met each
other because it was only like three
months before I left and I was telling
him before I left and I was like I can't
have a boyfriend I'm going to Europe for
a few months so sorry we hold food ever
and he was finding that he was like that
sign like we can just see each other be
friends and then obviously we hit it off
we ended up going away and we were
sorted together probably worst part of
it was just the missing him it was it
definitely difficult you just need to
make sure you have lots of communication
like we facetimed all the time
yeah I definitely struggled but you know
that in the end if you want to be with
this person for a long time you have
potential your whole life to be with
them who knows and when you're traveling
that's just 2 months out of your life
and 2 months away from them out of a
long time that you could possibly be
with them so you have to look at it like
a really short term thing and don't let
it ruin your don't let it ruin your trip
that you just need to look at it like
you'll see them soon and you just need
to throw yourself into what you're doing
at the time I didn't feel the need to be
with anyone else at all because I'm
completely into him so just yeah it
should just be easy when you love the
person I would say as well
Trust is definitely a big deal unit
definitely need to be able to trust the
person otherwise if I was at home and he
was traveling and I didn't trust him it
would be like torture but because he
trusted me and I trust him
you just don't it's not it's not a worry
like I do I wasn't worried and
he wasn't worried and if you don't trust
the person that you're with you probably
should reconsider whether you should be
with them you know like they shouldn't
be scaring you or making you feel like
they might be doing something behind
your back anyway because that's not
that's not happy in a relationship in my
opinion so how was traveling with your
best friends did it take a toll on your
friendship as oh no oh my that's my dogs
me and my best friends are like exactly
the same people we probably had one
fight and Annapolis when we were all
really drunk and then we woke up the
next morning and we all just started
laughing like it's honestly so easy to
travel with your best friends when
you're the same people and you have so
much in common but you're also different
people like we're all different we all
have different personalities we love the
same things that makes it really easy
because if they are your best friends
you're going to trust each other you're
gonna help each other when things are
tough and you get along you have similar
personalities and you have similar
interests anyway well that's it that was
the case for me so the traveling with my
best friends definitely didn't take a
toll in the friendship if anything it
just made us all a lot closer so a lot
of you guys actually asked for me how
much my trip cost and how long it took
me to save um for everyone it's
different depending on your job and how
often you work I worked at a pub and
then also had my youtube channel yeah I
saved money that way I would look so
exactly how much I've spent cuz honestly
everyone spends a different amount of
money but I will tell you what my travel
got to because we had a travel travel
agency suggest certain money to us so
she said for two months to save about
eight thousand dollars and that gave you
that gave us about a hundred dollars a
day I think if I'm if I'm remembering
correctly because obviously one day I
might spend $30.00
and another day might go shopping and
spend 200 so it's not try to aim to
stick to a budget but you need to make
sure you're also still enjoying yourself
and you're not restricting yourself too
much yeah so she said roughly for two
months was about $8,000 I would go over
attempting to bring more money than you
need just so that you feel safe I can't
figure out my hair I'm so sorry I keep
like flicking my hair around
were you ever homesick and did you miss
your family
yeah there were definitely times I was
homesick for sure like when you're
overseas you crave things that you're
familiar with for me I was craving
things like chucker they live around the
corner from a chicken shop called char
girl Charlie's and I would like cry like
craving children's burgers and those
trips and then I would crave things like
sushi train which I always go to sushi
train or even fresh blend the Thai salad
like there were certain things that I
was craving from home that was just so
annoying because you just couldn't get
overseas or you just couldn't find it
over there but or even avocado on toast
or like a good coffee but but you just
find other things and you just need to
realize that that's not what you are and
you need to get over it and you need to
stop crying about sugars burgers
everything is exactly the same when you
get home
like honestly from the minute you walk
back into your house it's exactly the
same so don't like you don't need to
miss it because honestly it'll be that
when you're home someone asked when I'm
filming a video with my boyfriend and
unfortunately I don't think that's ever
gonna happen I've asked him and his
reaction through it was not so good so I
don't think yeah they kill covenant
actual sit-down video but they'll be in
lots of my vlogs for sure what happened
to my camera and phone um so when I was
overseas and I was filming I like I put
my vlogging camera on the couch to film
me days in Halle getting ready for ultra
so like a little sit down get ready with
us have a video and the camera just
slipped off the couch and the couch I
kid you not was like that high off the
ground and it just wouldn't turn on it
was black it like I turned on and it
would make all these fuzzing like
crackling noises and I was just like
okay that's really annoying but that's
fine
so insurance by your travel insurance
and then with my phone the day that I
got back I dropped my phone down the
side of Nick's car and I couldn't reach
with my hand because he's had seats were
too tight
so I grabbed that I tried to push the
seat forwards to like get it from behind
and it completely crushed my phone in
between the seats and like snapped my
phone in half so I thought I lost all my
footage from Croatia and Greece because
obviously I had to start filming on my
phone because my vlogging camera was
broken in Croatia and then I took it
into the like iPhone shop and then they
fixed it for me thank God if I wasn't
doing YouTube what would I want to be
doing um well I would be wanting to do
PR for sharks I'm doing pub comm at uni
and that's sort of I'm taking the major
sort of PR I'd hope that when I finish
YouTube or if I ever get sick of it
which I won't for a long time so I
absolutely love doing it and just flip
over to the other side and work in a PR
company or for a company as their PR
person but otherwise I've been thinking
recently that I want to start my own
brand of lipsticks I think so um let me
know if you guys would ever would ever
buy something that I created it is and I
just want to create a line that would be
lots of different nude colors but but in
really matte strong vibrant
formulas that isn't necessarily liquid
lipstick I don't know I haven't really
thought of that
like that much into it um yeah let me
know if you guys would ever buy
something that I created because I'd
love to get your opinion on that because
anything worse than if I created it and
guys didn't like it so let me know if
that's something that you guys would
like to see me do possibly in the future
someone asked is this SNS on my nails
and moment you
this is SNS I go to Selene nails in most
men and I get the shade funny bunny and
the shape is coffin coffin shape in case
any of you are wondering so you guys
have asked hateful questions but that's
probably all I have time to answer
because otherwise this video is going to
be like hundreds and hundreds of minutes
long let me know if you guys want
another Q&amp;amp;A purely based on my travels
and beta so I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up if
