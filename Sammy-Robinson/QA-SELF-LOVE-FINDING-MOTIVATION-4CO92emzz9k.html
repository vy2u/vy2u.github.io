so I took to my Instagram and I asked
you guys to ask a question and so quite
a few it took me a while to go through
my phone and actually read them all so I
decided sorry my camera just died
instead of having to go through them
again I decided to write through my book
so that would make it just easier to
choose the questions that were sort of
the most commonly asked or I have an
answer before I start I thought I would
just tell you guys all to my lips
because I know that you're going to ask
I'm using the Charlotte Tilbury iconic
nude lip liner thermal lipstick in 700
trendsetter and then I've got some
hourglass child over the top let's begin
shall we
a lot of you guys ask me a lot about
self-love I think I could do a whole
video on this if you guys wanted to see
a whole video on self-love I could
definitely do that so far has become a
super super important part of my life
I've never been necessarily a self
conscious person I've never necessarily
hated myself or you know felt worthless
but my favorite quality in people is in
their warmth and I've said this before
my channel the way that a person is and
how warm and kind and nurturing they are
is what I strive to basically we have
moments in our day where we just want to
yell at something or something's
annoying us and you can obviously vent
about it it's not a bad thing to vent
your friends or have a talk about things
that are really on your mind and
annoying you but if you can make a
conscious effort most of the time to
just look at everything in a positive
light then it'll just make a massive
difference to you as a person I think
there has been moments in my life where
I have looked at certain things
negatively and just hated it
was I if I try to wake up every day and
seeing everything that's about to happen
in my day in a positive life it just
makes everything so much easier so for
example if I have a really really packed
up day slight moment and a half I'd like
to see me go to a dinner have jobs to do
get a video up the next day and things
are really really stressing me out which
has been happening quite a lot in the
last few weeks actually there's been a
lot going on and it's been very
fast-paced
that usually would really really stir
me out as a person but I have decided to
consciously look at everything in small
blocks I don't look at the next three
days and go and screw ashlynn same bed I
looked at the next owl what I can
achieve in the next hour I look at the
next few hours what I can do before
lunchtime what I can achieve after lunch
time about segmenting things in my life
and that just makes everything a lot
easier to me and it gives my mental
spatial and clarity having a positive
outlook on even negative things will
make that negative thing often times
better so in terms of self-love that's
probably the main thing for me is being
a positive person
therefore the discussin makes me
appreciate myself love myself so much
more because I can see that I'm doing
good for myself I thank myself for
looking at things in that light in terms
of self love in a confidence level and
being your own person I think what I've
learned the most from I guess going from
high school to now is that I can't put
my happiness in anyone else but myself
there's a while there I was putting my
happiness in whatever boy I was seeing
and I was putting my happiness in my
friends and relying on the people around
me to make me happy and if they weren't
making me happy I'd be really sad and
now I put all my happiness in myself and
then that way I can be a happier better
person to the people around me that I
need to look out I need to look out for
myself
first I'm my number one priority and yes
that can seem like a very selfish thing
when you put yourself first but when you
bring yourself first in terms of you
have your own happiness that actually
just then resonates on to the people
around you and then the things you do in
your life this probably might not be
making sense to you and I haven't really
thought out my answers all that much so
if you guys want a whole video on that I
can definitely do that for you and I can
really probably think up my answers and
explain myself up early but I feel
really beautiful quote the other day
that said if the whole world was blind
who would you impress if no one who
didn't see you and your physical
attributes meant nothing then who would
you still impress by your actions and
the way you speak in the way you talk to
people and how kind you are as a person
I guess and that's when all the health
and fitness stuff is coming for me as
well entering my body right and putting
the right nutrients into my body and I'm
living it at more of an active lifestyle
I feel as my body thanks me my mind
thinks we've got so much more clarity
and that's just another aspect of
self-love you need to
take care of yourself and love yourself
in that aspect as well later on from
that another really probably one of the
most asked questions was how do I keep
motivated to eat healthy and exercise
this is an interesting one for me
because I was always the girl that
although through high school I played so
much sport and that's where I kept
active I hated the gym I hated exercise
and I loved junk food and that is still
the case of me I love jumpsuit in terms
of food firstly how do I say motivated
to eat healthily I'm really really and
I'm lucky that I love salad I love a lot
of really healthy super foods but not
the foods that I'm eating
are necessarily low in calories I love
peanut butter I love Otello sidled I
love nuts and like lots of fats and
really like quite high calorie foods but
it's because I'm eating those and
they're better for my body it's
digesting better and it's not sitting in
my body as much as in packaged lollies
so you know I might want to go buy a
packet of lollies and I'll substitute
that was in a saleable but if I have all
tastes just as good to me so yes in
terms of food I guess you just have to
kind of find substitutes for yourself I
love a lot of food so I just really try
to reach for the ones that I know are
better for me than the junk options
there was a while there where I was
eating bones and fries every single day
packets of lollies I'll go by myself
packaged them and I was just either by
myself I'm lucky I've got a very fast
metabolism so I can eat the most
disgusting amount of food and it shows
up with me after a while before I were
here if you perspective my old videos I
just look a bit swollen like I would
never ever ever said that I was fat but
I'm just like swollen and like a just a
bit more than cutesy cuddly version of
myself I guess to know is before you're
just eating lollies in Burma's like you
wouldn't believe it was quite disgusting
to be honest and then in terms of
exercise don't just try to exercise that
other people are doing because you feel
like you should could they are for me I
was doing that well I wasn't doing that
that was actually the problem I felt the
need to go for runs and go to the gym
and do all these things everyone else
was doing to stay fit and I didn't enjoy
it at all actually hated it so I
at all I've now found for me I found
Pilates and it's not even like I don't
dread going to Pilates I love it
find an exercise that you enjoy that
might be a sport I was super intimidated
by the gym and I didn't know how to do
anything in the gym and that was my
problem because I got there and I was
like I can't do that I can't do that I
can't do that I'm too Ambassador than to
embarrass to that I'm going to break
that every excuse in the book I could
make I did if we ask a friend that knows
how to do the gym look up YouTube videos
where they teach you how to do the
proper technique so maybe we won't be so
intimidated by it
my friend day so there's an awesome
thing called yoga by Adrienne make sure
you leave time to exercise is my number
one thing I lose time in every morning
to do exercise and make sure you find
the exercise that you enjoy actually
doing another thing that I've really
really enjoyed doing recently is
skipping so I have any travel plans in
the future yes I do so I'm going to be
going to st. Tropez very soon it's going
to be a very very very short trip and
it's with a brand that I'm just
traveling over there with so it's going
to be the most amazing time but yeah
when I have more information on that
I'll tell you guys about that I'm going
to Whistler in February next so very
obviously with my girlfriends we're
going for two weeks skiing and then I'm
definitely going back to Coachella I am
NOT missing two children I'm just doing
that except I'm going to bring Nick this
time cell and holes going to come and
car dear and everyone a lot of you guys
asked where I see myself in five to ten
years
um in fact for ten years I don't really
have a plan I'd love to have my own
business and my own brand in five years
I hope to still be a new to I'm not
really sure things are moving so fast
paced in this world and YouTube could be
gone in like a year so I'm not depending
anything on YouTube but in five years I
would definitely love to be married and
have a baby because I don't want to have
a bit donuts diving family too late so
yes definitely Sophia's I want have a
baby so badly I think I definitely just
want to have my own brand I know exactly
what I want to do but whether it's going
to work out or not I don't know so it's
I have a few things coming up that can
be a bit trial and error for me and let
you guys in on a few clues I haven't
started anything to do with my brand
there's no what I would ideally love to
do and I think you guys would love it as
well so a lot of you guys actually asked
how how I deal with being tall and I was
really sad to see most of the comments
being like hate being tall how you deal
with it I love being tall you guys have
to embrace your height being tall I get
it
when I was in primary school I hated it
I totally hated it but a relative what
your height is you just have to love
yourself because you only got your one
body there's no point hating yourself
because you've got this one life and
you've been giving this one body so
there is no point wasting that life
hating your body it's beautiful it's so
beautiful to be tall and you just need
to embrace it walk with your shoulders
back oh so nice like hide my height what
already showed us back how confident and
you will pull it off I promise and same
goes for show people or medium people
Walker shows back have confidence you'll
make anything look beautiful opponents
and a few of you guys asked like how do
I handle my haters what do I say to my
haters Lola that's what I say nothing to
my haters don't give them a single cent
of the day never applied as my point I
always go by the same need to be the
brightest juiciest mango in the whole
world but there's always going to be
people that hate mangoes and that's just
really relevant tell everyone life much
as I would love to please everyone I
can't and I gotta get over it so yeah do
I think I'll go back to uni yes
definitely I'm not sure if I will go
back physically or if I'll do it online
but I've got a very traditional dad and
he's not going to let me get away with
not going to university it's definitely
very important to me to have a degree
and I would I just want to go back but
right now in this at this time it for
any of you guys are wondering the reason
I did too sir was because I was
constantly traveling all over the place
my job required me to be in Melbourne
one week in Queensland the next overseas
the next so you know at UCF for me if I
missed two tutorials the subject was I
couldn't pass it so I couldn't be in
both places at one time and right now I
choose YouTube because I might look back
and regret it if I don't choose YouTube
so I definitely want to just ride this
whole YouTube wave out see where it goes
and
and when I feel I've got more time or
when things are slowing down a little
bit more then I'll definitely pick up
university again another question was do
I get stretch marks and absolutely I do
I don't have that many of them in saying
that but I have them pretty much all
over my bucks I've got a lot bigger
almond size than my upper body and I'm
just also you know my I had growth spurt
for my skin stretched and I got those
stretch marks stretch marks I don't care
about them at all and not self-conscious
of them at all I think they are so
normal to look at pictures online and
think that's what you've got to look
like it's actually very normal and quite
beautiful to help stretch marks can't
remember what she said exactly that was
when in LA I met this woman and just
also something about wrinkles and she
said I would never feel Mary including
ripping my wrinkles like the roadmap of
my life and it shows where I've been and
what I've done and some like emims as a
person
it's her expressions and the way she
expresses herself shows on her face
that's really relevant to stretch marks
as well that just shows who you are as a
person how you've grown and what you
become as a woman it's you becoming a
woman but again I don't disagree with
enhancements if you want to get a bit of
Botox and put a bit of filler in your
lips to make yourself feel more
confident go for it
what did I want to be as a kid I wanted
to be an ice cream scooper I would I
would just go into ice cream shops and
watch them to have those Coopers and I
just wanted to do that so badly I also
wanted to I don't know if you guys
remember when you drive like over the
bridge or they used to be the tolls
where you would physically hand your
toll money to the paid people I wanted
to be those told people what do I think
of the Australian YouTube community I
love them I think they're all great
might personally in my max connectives
squad I love all of them they're all so
lovely such divine women and then like
all different states love Ronnie Korea's
my best friend and then that YouTube
group like Michael and Shaunie and Ron
even they're really funny I think
they're great
so yeah I don't really I Katya is
probably my the only youtuber though I
see frequently cuz she lives in Sydney
but yeah I think everyone's really funny
what is one of my biggest insecurities
and how do I overcome them I don't know
if you guys noticed
struggle to lift this lip I have a good
I have a good planner bad side so this
side I can smile normally and then this
side I can't lift it's lit like it's
like this face sighs my face like
doesn't leave can you see that like my
lip I'm trying really hard so when I
talk I talk a little bit crooked and
I've got like a bit of a like I talk
this way and this lip doesn't lift and I
know those I don't think I would never
noticed that about myself if I wasn't a
youtuber and I didn't edit myself and
look at myself every single day on my
computer screen
we're only so pedantic about how we look
because we have to watch ourselves every
day and not that I ever let it affect me
I wouldn't ever want it to affect me but
not a lot of people laughter so every
day talking to themselves like it's a
weird job like if you think about it
like I'm by myself pretty much all day
filming by myself camera and then I edit
myself I need paper on little things
about myself but I can't let myself be
affected by it because I know that I
probably wouldn't notice that if I
didn't have this job another question is
do I ever wish that I had a normal life
I mean there are definitely points I'm
not going to lie and say no I'm so happy
all the time sometimes I do get that
feeling where I just want to wear a mask
and be able to hide and not have to go
out and steal eyes on me necessarily
that sounds really arrogant but it's
just kind of like what comes with being
a youtuber and that's like totally fine
I know I know I know that that's part of
it I just want to do normal young things
sometimes which I can't do all the time
but that's okay because it's all very
very worth it to me but my dad and
parents think of my youtube channel and
me dropping Ivy me and my success and
everything like that they're very proud
of me obviously dad wants me to go back
to uni and which I'm not even like
pushing against again
okay go back to uni much like they're
very supportive I do
interesting cos very real at first but
yeah that I couldn't have more
supportive parents that's absolutely
amazing to me and close my whole family
and all my friends I'm very lucky that
is not a question my gosh I'm so into
probably a very very long video
not intending it to be such a long video
but it has definitely turned out to be
that way so I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching make sure you give it a thumbs
up if you did enjoy it and subscribe to
my channel and already and I'll see you
