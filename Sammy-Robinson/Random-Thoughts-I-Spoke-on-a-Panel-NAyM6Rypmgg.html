coffee I just been to the gym what would
blanket it's freezing insidious morning
and it has been for the last few days I
don't know what it is beautifully sunny
outside
my name is so-called really dirty jump
run I need to have a shower I need to
film myself maybelline video as you can
see the backdrop is looking good there's
no Sun coming through so I can film that
now I'm really really trying lately to
be a really positive person as in
watching so many videos on positivity I
have a normal girl and I'm 20 it's such
a learning curve for me and it always
will be I don't even know what I'm doing
I'm young like I feel like it's at this
stage I mean my life I should start
making my own brand and I really want to
make my own brand that is like the
biggest dreams made it is to have my own
brand that I can give to you guys but
I'm still 20 like I don't need to rush I
don't need to you know push myself so
far ahead of everything because I want
to enjoy life as well I cry all the time
every person cries over different things
different things upset different people
it could be to different extents
everyone feels sadness but no one would
feel happiness if they didn't know what
sadness felt like it's because we're
humans be careful who you're judging and
be careful what you're saying because
you never know what that could do your
person milah everyone you walk past
because you never know what that could
do to a person you know say hi how are
you call someone beautiful that could do
nothing it could blow straight over
their head or they could think about it
for at least a few minutes and they
could have been having a really bad day
in the end being a negative person won't
do anything for you because it's going
to attract negativity what you put up
there you're going to get back
don't put your happiness in other people
don't put expectations in other people
because it will crush you if they don't
live up to it don't let other people
control how you feel okay I've got some
finagling I'm so sorry about this feel
but I just felt word moment and I
thought I would I
no one is home I had no one to talk to
so I was like I'm going to say it on
camera okay so I just
I've just finished in finished finished
I have just finished filming my
maybelline video I just did a really
bronzy natural look which I do all the
time on my channel and a lot of you
complain that all my looks are the same
but this isn't on my channel this is on
my channel so I thought the best video I
could possibly do for my first video
with them would be in that drawer bronzy
look it's sort of a look inspired by
Fashion Week so we obviously went
backstage and how to look it on the
makeup looks nigel showed us the looks
for the season and so I sort of
recreated it but put my own spin on it
all the looks on the runway are so
natural they're very minimal make-up
it's just like tiny little enhancements
here and there so my eyebrow is looking
very dark so I got them dives over day
but um yeah so this is sort of come up
with so if you guys want to check that
out it should be on my Maybelline
YouTube channel soon it will be up soon
so keep an eye out on that and make sure
you subscribe to that channel because
I'm putting heaps of videos up there for
them woo I spot a wild Gidget into a
wild Cleo and a wild Henry reading and
the happy that oh hi I didn't see you
there so I just had some lunch now I'm
doing a bit of editing it is so cold in
Sydney at the moment I am freezing my
ass off right now I've got long pants
long sleeve beads jumper shoes socks
everything I'm still shivering this was
peach and pineapple flavor and a very
tangy I don't know if I liked it so now
I'm just going to edit my Maybelline
video and send in for approval because
for them obviously it's not flies trying
to also needs to get approved you know
sort of read over the questions that
will be asked to me tonight at the thing
what's called the talent lab so I'm
going to be on a panel and people are
going to be asking me questions and I'm
really nervous because I'm really bad at
speaking with
quite often when I watch myself back I
literally don't make sense like do you
guys have to do that I don't know if you
film yourself that often but a lot of
things I say in my blogs I'm like wow I
fully thought I just formed a cohesive
sentence and it literally did not make
sense I'm pretty nervous low or a
who can fit what the hell I'm just going
to get ready for tonight
and I'm not going to talk I'm just going
to put on speed through so you guys can
see what I'm using and I'm just going to
do my classic everyday what I always do
look looks uncomfortable in it and
because I'm speaking on a stage
that's want me to do I'm just gonna um
brush my eyebrows through with some
clear brow gel and then um then I'm
going to put my lip on once I'm ready so
I'll show you guys the finished look
once I'm all dressed it's kind of like
I'm not going to be wearing this okay so
this is my outfit I've got really random
I don't really ever wear something like
this but it's so cold so I'm going to
wear this Browns Givi these black jeans
and a belt and these shoes then I could
cello boots they're so like big and
bulky but other than though I've lost it
and that's the jacket Amanda from
Topshop so I don't know if can ties it
all together and so I've finished my
makeup as well I just added a bit more
highlighter so that it was a little bit
more dewy cuz I'm so drying winter so to
fill it to be a little bit more glowy
and if I did this lipstick which is
bow-and-arrow by Kat Von D this is this
better
it's in Mac's media labs little
conference room this the stage I'll be
sitting on Laura's we interviewer the
river is at max media lab the girls are
here and we have about probably like
half an hour to kill before people will
start arriving so Holly had caught us a
glass of champagne to release the news a
little bit and really nervous I'm happy
because lychees going to be speaking
with me so I've got friends up there
into the point in their career like I
say he's going through your things I
think I have been doing at into city I
was proud to work for a site visit my
abs every year to make deposits meeting
where the business stuff strong and
intelligent we went to a genuine 2.1 I
was integrated okay he'll definitely get
if I ask are you know anything I don't
like it before it up pretty light blue
well cannot leave any money
I've had about industry accent the
alkalinity self-pity and to ensure that
your content your reflection of the
personality I thought about doing trust
makeup I love anything I am so festive
activities and things all time very
perilous after beginning English on my
videos over Shia doing I am of men
father I am NOT all thought of trying to
do everything that you can possibly
working that as I just say negative act
now that a lot fashion is myself being a
left eyelid opponent that I like you
know I'll be that counselor and that
became authentically became more myself
I just try what love the different
things that for the camera we have
incited and I loved it and I have really
business and
and you're always insulting and I love
it emitting that tunnels without me any
more about health and yeah it's a very
good new conceivability no weapon will
evolve and I think until they open it up
like today up chuckles some chips in
here I want to be control again it's
just a shame that people that watch you
guys laugh at you at a middle and I want
that you to pay and you have to get out
and love is pretty one weapon and so I
just made it happy about that one in
terms of Shiva
I should've later and if I'm proud of
myself and recording to behind me if I
love it
