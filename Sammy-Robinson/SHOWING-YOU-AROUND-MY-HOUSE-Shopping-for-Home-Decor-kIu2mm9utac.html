a new vlog but I've already ended this
logoff I just wanted to jump in on this
slug and just let you guys know I'm
having a meet-up
this Saturday I'm so freaking excited
but at the same time so nervous I've
done to meetups before one was with
Katya and one was with bellifiore and
Tina young so I've never done one by
myself and I'm like so nervous no one's
gonna be there
I'm really hoping to meet some of you
but just be the world to make you guys
came I would just be so thankful and
also so excited to meet some of you
because obviously as youtubers we are
constantly behind our screens and behind
our cameras and we never actually get to
see you guys in real life that often it
is always kind of a pinch me moment cuz
you go wow like actually there is people
watching it's not just me sitting here
in my room by myself and I love meeting
you guys out what amount I meet you guys
out all the time it's always like you
know individually or in little small
group so rarely do I get to meet all of
you in big groups of people and I'm just
I'm so excited and I'm so nervous so it
is Monday today that is on Saturday I
will leave all the details down below in
my description box it's in Sydney so I'm
doing it with Sephora so it'll be at the
Sephora store in Westfield in Bondi
Junction in Monday John yeah in Mont I
jump in and I'll be there from 11:00 and
I think I'm doing a little Q&amp;amp;A on stage
and then I will start the meter with
meaning graded around 11:30 I think so
it's Saturday morning it's not too early
in the morning so hopefully you guys
will make it you know even if you just
come up come say hello and go get some
lunch at Bondi because it's such a
beautiful area so if you're not around
here you could make like a little day of
it go to the beach summer this is me
trying to come look but yeah obviously
up to you guys I would love to meet you
guys again I'll leave all the details
down in the description box
and yeah I hope to see you guys there so
let's get on with the vlog
hey guys so excuse this sweaty mess I
just thought I would start a vlog
because I completely forgot to it this
morning
mom and I have been to came out and
bought a few things I thought I would
just show you guys around the house at
some of the new decor we bought but so
yes I did just go to the gym I signed up
for a new gym which I love it's called
flow Athletic it's so good does the best
classes I'm so sorry I'm like tripping
it's so hot in Sydney this week I
thought I'd show you guys around at some
of the new stuff that I got and then
I'll take you guys to Ikea as well so
sorry I forgot about Kayla it's mine but
that's okay oh yeah um so yeah I got
this hip a little fake obviously rug I
don't know I just needed something in
here obviously I've got stuff all over
the floor because need to put up my
shelves you need to build these shelves
here so so my hats and shoes and stuff I
don't have spots for and just like lots
of little things like this so that I can
hang stuff up behind my door and hide
rings I got these I'm gonna stack up so
that I can for my folders and rent stuff
and contracts and everything in there
because right now I just have it all
over the floor in my bathroom we've got
a little bath mat and I've got this
thing to put stuff on I didn't know yet
I needed a little shower things on my
shampoos and so we're sitting on the
edge I know it's just annoying
nice fresh plants I really should start
presenting myself better when I stop
blogging for you guys cuz I've realized
in all my folks that I went any makeup
and I look like a piece of
but that's just the way I am most of the
times though this is another little
bathmat that I got but basically I'm
going to go to Ikea now and get a big
cupboard up here and that way of my
linen and towels
similarly in here I'm gonna get a
massive thing for Mike here and put it
up there for all my bathroom products so
up here I've got a bunch of hooks that
I'm gonna put paintings and for now this
is what I got from Kmart I think I'm
gonna go black and white theme my
brother's over watching the TV I've got
this rug that's fluffy rug my Fox Hills
been set up and the mom not wanting to
be in it I got these marble things
because I'm gonna take do more food
stuff more like cook what I eat in a day
so Tech static oh this will make it look
fancy some water jugs and my dad is
coming over today so me mom dad I'm
gonna have a lunch my mom's just been to
the deli and got all this yummy stuff
yeah except having mom over she cleans
hehehe so friend I got a fruit bowl so I
got this one came out as well so I also
got myself a little Christmas tree I
decided to go with white can't really
see but basically it's a white tree so
it's a white tree and I'm gonna go rose
gold
baubles and I might go get some white
ones and then I got a big lamp for the
lounge room and I also got some twinkly
lights put on it as well
yeah you the washing machines like me
it's very loud say mum and I are now on
our way to Ikea we're gonna do a little
bit of shopping for some cupboards and
drawers that way I can put on my
bathroom stuff away and then we'll kind
of fish that I might have a look at a
few couches the couches for now cozy and
comfy ain't good enough I just would
ideally love an old couch so that I can
cozy up in the corner of it that's my
favorite thing about like a lounge room
couch okay it's like the last thing
really that my house will become my home
by the way these glasses are from law
specs made it to Ikea
I can makes me so excited because they
basically put together like little rooms
for inspiration so like things that you
can copy so like this is like a more
masculine retro ready vibes and then
they've got like white ones over there
and kitchens and ideas do you see you
can take things I love it so much to
choose from how cute this area is so
this is like a room and it gives you an
idea of like how you could set up your
area like if you had a little small flat
and then like you walk through it the
barbecue in the outdoor area so cool I
love it there for capping that a cute
very nice bathroom break I'm just about
to go get a coffee cuz we're halfway
through IKEA I'm just having the best
time this is my favorite thing to do
we're now on the bottom level I've just
got myself a coffee and this is the fun
part getting all the home decor some we
load up on heaps of plants
perfect thank you on my shelves okay so
it was a successful shopping trip now
I'm just in the midst of putting
everything away and I'm gonna show you
guys afterwards there's many painting in
or like print is up there those two my
little spurts of gray so I'll show you
guys after and look who's home so now
I'm gonna attempt to make this shoe rack
and I'll show you guys how are you
once you spray yeah
my little shoe closet
so it's pouring today which means
buildings built so I'm gonna build all
my dining-room chairs right now and a
few cupboards for up in the bathroom
it's my second coffee of the day I am
starting to become a little bit of a
coffee addict and I've been having at
least two coffees a day which is so bad
success 1 2 3 3 4 so that's the chairs
very random but cool now for the
Christmas tree okay and so these are the
drawers we've brought from Ikea
yesterday I want to draw us because I
found with my last cupboard if I put
stuff at the back I would never have
seen it so with drawers I can pull it
out and I can see everything that I've
got and they're nice big deep drawers
that will fit a lot of stuff so put all
of this stuff away in there now so it's
Sunday now and I'm having friends over
today my gosh my hair's crazy having
friends over today for the first time
which I'm so excited about I've had
Holly over eyed holy over and I've had
Nick over but never ever run together so
that everyone's gonna come for some
drinks so I'm gonna do my makeup now and
I thought I would do like a little mini
get ready with me with you guys just
because I feel like it so I'm gonna
start off I used my Charlotte Tilbury
wonder cream and now I'm going to put on
some Smashbox photo-finish
pore minimizing primer I find these ones
also matte my face really nicely and
it's super hot in Sydney so I just want
something that's gonna make me really
mad not so much glowy because I will
naturally get the glow all right now
which foundation do I want to use I can
use okay so I'm going to mix the urban
decay all nighter because it's very
matte and put a bit of this first a
beauty fab hello fab triple protection
skin tint which is like what I wear on
its own but it's very dark so I'm going
to put it with a bit of coverage
it's where the skin tint more often Oaks
is so light will be so perfect for
summer
no I'd still a bit light
that's like in bronze oh yeah and I
forget that this foundation oxidizes a
little bit so that we go I might just do
my base with you guys because I don't
know how long this vlog is already I
think it's pretty long because I've
shown you all my house decor and
everything so all you guys now we use a
lot of my Clinique chubby stick in kobe
contour and I mean a lot but look it's
empty
I can't screw it up anymore so I've got
a fresh one but I'm determined to finish
this one off before I start the other
one this is just such a good color
now my top shape takes definitely need
new ones of these they are so dry and
run out but I still just love them like
when I'm going out or like doing
something kind of more eventful I'll
always opt for heart-shaped cake
otherwise always my Sigma one every day
every day actually I'd say like this is
probably my everyday one and this is
easy just to my favorite for my weekend
one I like event one should I keep you
guys should be like here it's so much my
life one read that for a sec took my
favorite thing concealing the veins in
the back marriage okay now that I think
about it I think you guys are gonna just
get really bored cuz I'm gonna be doing
the same makeup that I do always so I'll
just check in with you guys and I'm done
by the way what do you think of the no
eyelash look I just really haven't had
time to go get them done but I mean I
don't like me not that I'm healthy
Wheatley like usually I have no
eyelashes left like usually I'm old but
they're not too bad I'm giving them done
on Monday so it's only in the last few
days tomorrow okay done tomorrow and
today we have it I think it's silly
thing out of my head oh so so I've got
the Anastacio modern renascence palette
on my eyes and Becca opal on my cheeks
I've been loving these gland brands by
L'Oreal as my bronzer and this is just
my lip liner so far and it's my
Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude
I think what I'll do actually is I'll
just end this vlog here and then I might
start another one tomorrow when I go get
my eyelashes and everything done I'm
going back
to my grand back to my parents house to
upload a video finally because I'm gonna
put up my moving vlog and then New York
will just come randomly whenever it
comes looking tomorrow I'm really into
vlogs and I think it's kind of
interesting while I'm doing the move for
you guys to see so let me know if you
guys do like that so give it a thumbs up
I love you guys thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
