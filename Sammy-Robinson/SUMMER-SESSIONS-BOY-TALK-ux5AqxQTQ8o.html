was 12 I was a Playboy mom early bloomer
mine was on a balcony of an abandoned
building mine was behind the lock is a
key a car which is like a show in prison
Oh someone that can make me laugh
someone that is really loving and caring
I like protective guy so I like to feel
very
you are so true okay and then tall for
me it looks wise I like tall dark
handsome and for me my like classic is
always I love Beach Boys so like scruffy
and bad boys but still with the net soul
who are interested in music and sense
when things may like the beach and yeah
genuinely like interested in me for me
not for any other reason and no
boys please no so there's like that word
I'm a little chick I'm allergic to that
word
if I knew I'd write a freaking book on
it to be honest with breaking the
friendzone I think it's just bit by bit
smooth touches here and there and just
see how they react like that like saying
it would be feeling like maybe like
extend the laughs a little more like oh
I'm gonna put your hand on their leg or
like oh it's too bright in the color
body it's like funny like in love again
with them either way whatever or if
you've tried to do things like that
and you've already really tried to drop
hints here and there and they're just
not going for it every don't go front
don't go for it or if you're willing to
risk losing a friendship just tell them
you like them or just get drunk and kiss
rescue business yeah yeah either if it
if it's worth if it's worth breaking the
friendship because you actually like
them that much then I personally would
go for it yeah because I would find it
hard to just be friends with someone
anyways and then watching them being
with other girls like for me I wouldn't
be able watch that so if it's worth it
then go for it but otherwise yeah if you
have to test the waters I like in each
and I will be different for however do
young on how close you are and also they
can we start dropping it first drop the
hint drop the hint give them the hill
hey touches who was your first crush
I've had two so I had one in primary
school for like five years a really long
term boyfriend we were like the king and
queen of relationships in private school
you know like the advice givers everyone
goes - that was us and then I had one in
high school so one long-term boyfriend
in high school um
I'm currently sitting on I don't know if
you can count a one-week relationship in
grade seven
besides that a big old zero I used to be
that all the boy in the situation and
just was a heartless bitch pretty much
but now I but now she's looking for love
so I'll leave her digits down here I'm
sorry
come at me I'm so yeah give her a call
obviously surround yourself with
boyfriends keep yourself so busy and go
out and have fun but don't go out
looking for a new boy just it also don't
have it don't happen won't happen but
make sure you are just keeping yourself
distracted but I honestly reckon the
most important thing of how to get over
a guy is just to know that it ended for
a reason like it's you know if it was
still meant to be there it would be
there and like holding on to something
that showed me hold on to it's
ridiculous in silos you're going to like
get upset over stuff that you should not
be upset over so but you have to realize
that your self-worth in the situation if
it's in if a reason it happens if
donkeys you move on with your life
because you can't it's so easy like guys
hold your life in place interception
because personally for me I'm going
through a bit of a tough
trying to get a right guy and I'm so
much better now because I surround
myself depends I keep myself busy but
yeah it's hard it's hard to move on like
you want them to come back but if
they're not supposed to be in your life
then they're not supposed to be but it's
hard yeah yeah it's like saying if it
inside you it's been I do um because you
give them one chance they might stuff it
up they might not realize you know
certain things blob are things are in
the way they come back the second time
give them another chance I don't believe
in third chances I do believe in second
chances though because things could have
been happening in their lives things
could be happening in your lives might
not have worked at the time if you truly
want to be with them you try again try
again one more time if it doesn't work
then yeah time John but like I don't
think yeah yes for me it depends on the
circumstances of the guy and stuff I
guess
as I said I used to be pretty cold with
it so I'm not as open anymore sometimes
you're like tidy with like tidy I'm so
tight when it comes to trust and like if
a guy screws me over
straight up I normally won't give him a
second chance I guess it depends how
well I know them how long we've been
seeing each other it's starting dating I
wouldn't if you've seen them for a
little bit longer and there's been a
connection there and it's been something
that you actually felt then I would
definitely give it a chance again and
just see if they're going to actually
improve or not and then if they don't
never it's a trend you never ever you'd
be lucky to even get a second chair
me like a dog but you can't put up with
that you deceptive with second chances
if you are going to give a guy a second
chance make sure you make him work out
late work for it
don't just let him think that he can
come back straightaway because then
that's when they think they can leave
you again
and then they'll think I've done it once
I can go back to her again it's yeah
right
if they actually truly watching back
they will work for it and they will show
you that they want you yeah and
otherwise don't let them back if they
just say hey can I have you back yet
yeah there's no effort and it is gonna
fit yeah make sure they work for you you
don't know you again like getting over a
boy you need to stretch health friends
getting over long-term relationships is
a little bit harder because you're used
to having someone constantly there with
you someone to constantly text someone
to constantly call have to cuddle just
all those sort of things so it is harder
to get over long-term relationships you
need to make sure you're not just
getting out there looking for guys for
the sake of it just because you think
you need that person to talk to you need
to as down to work on yourself and make
sure you are happy by yourself before
you need to have someone there to make
you happy I honestly think having a guy
my life makes me very happy but I don't
want to have to rely on having a guy to
be for your happiness that's like the
one made for so many one main fault
downfall is like thinking that you need
males acceptance or like a male's love
for you to be valid and happy like
there's so many other ways I think like
I guess I was trying Sami how
early on the TI like stop kind of seeing
guys for six months completely and it
was hard for me because like Sammy I
love having a guy around I just like
male company because I am very much like
a boy as much as I am like a girl like
it affects you involved um you feel
special in love but having time out for
yourself and realizing like I learned a
lot of it myself in that time off and I
realized like you kind of like I don't
know it's like you learn how to work you
know about having that love or is it I
guess no so many people tell you that
you think everyone tells me that people
going to come into my life and I least
expect it but you just want them now
yeah honestly distract yourself with
different things different interests
yeah and they will come into your life
and in the end the person that broke
your heart is going to be like damn it
and you also got no element by then yeah
you've moved on you're happy and they're
gonna want you back and you're not going
to be there honey this foot is going
crazy I need to put a leash on your foot
thank you so much straight away enough
guy likes you is if you just upfront
tells you like yeah and until it gets
that point in your like thing that
you're having seeing each other then you
definitely know that he's really
interested in you otherwise if it gets
to a point where you think it's there
and you're just like aging to know just
be like what is this that we're doing
and like you know there's no problem
with a girl being the one that's funny
I've been like what are we doing like
I've done that I've openly said like
what's going on with that like you need
one yeah you can't work wait around for
them to make because me guys give just a
shiz girls sometimes you wear humans
like it's like a victim yet so you need
to make sure you're also sure
that you're interested in can't expect a
guy to show you likes you will tell us
everything up a crazy about it like you
just have to think about it like as a
thesis another human I mean sometimes
they can't be a little Enoch and but uh
you know yeah the time they're harmless
little breaches I'm gonna go that just
says what I think so if I like a guy I
don't necessarily tell him but he'll
know I have a very on Thursdays all time
I want to have you seems like a year
attractive and if I want to hang out
with you and most of them like okay yeah
have you sure that you like them and
then they don't like you well then
they're not meant for you and it's their
loss so carriage over yeah okay like I
have a very expressive face apparently
my eyes say everything about the
professors that I can tell what I like
them oh that's like remember how we were
doing the thing we will you go tell yeah
yeah we're going how bad like with my
heart as you can see what we spent well
when it comes to size I'm like yeah yeah
you get oh like I D like that's what so
kind of like tousle mind gets like I
don't know that was it's like you I'll
stay oh no when I satellite someone I
will not lose contact with them but I
will like make sure that they know that
I'm like interested in talking Jim and
yet I like stare following they hold I
protect with you that's what I melt I'm
like yeah no because then you know and
where they get a little smack you smell
tells that all they do it back is like
your keys you know all somebody's I
guess I would just tell myself not to
compare myself to other people around me
so love love so it's all about
