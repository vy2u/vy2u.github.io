in I'm then taking my NARS radiant
concealer in the shade vanilla and I'll
just be drawing that with two lines down
my face so one on the side of my nose
and one underneath my eye and then just
connecting the lines and drawing a
triangle I feel like by doing this shape
underneath your eyes if you have larger
bags like I do it instead of highlight
highlighting the bags it just creates
more of a luminous look on the center of
your face so I'm then drawing it down
the center of my nose on the center of
my forehead and my chin this just
creates a more seamless effect on your
face and just highlights and brings all
of the areas that you want to bring
forward
so I'm just taking my Beauty Blender and
I'm just blending that all out I
actually run my Beauty Blender
underwater to make it damp and then I
just squeeze the water out because I
feel like it blends so much nicer way if
it's really down to set the places I
concealed I'm using the AC on tour kit
play Australis and I'm using these two
light shades at the top primarily the
banana shade and I'm just lightly
running that over the areas that I
concealed just to set them in place
after that I'll be taking a powder from
L'Oreal just to set the rest of my face
so the out of how add a portions of my
face it's just L'Oreal
my quota baby powder nude magique
then before I do my eyebrows I'd like to
just set my eyes just so that I avoid
the foundation creasing so I just said
it with the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
and then I go over that afterwards with
some of the banana powder from the AC on
tour contour and highlighting kit this
just ensures that I have a nice base for
when I do come back to my eyeshadows
later
so afterwards I'm just brushing through
my eyebrows with this hourglass brow
sculpting pencil and soft brunette and
then I'll just be filling them in with
this pencil as well
once I feel like I've filled in the
majority of my eyebrows I take this view
I ask brow gel and I draw on the end of
my tail the tail of my brow just making
it more precise than what a pencil would
do so for my eye shadow I'm taking this
covergirl blush and I'm using the three
shades actually as eyeshadows because I
feel like it creates a really nice soft
romantic look it's cute and pink and all
things beautiful so I take the middle
color as a transition shade through my
crease it just provides a nice nice base
I guess before I add a darker colors I
take that on my uhm large Sigma brush
I'll list it all down below in the
description box so I then take the
darker color at the top and I take that
a little more precise brush and I run
that through the crease again just
adding more depth and more color as I go
and then
of course taking your blending brush and
blending it all up
I then take this new tude palette by
bomb I believe yes and I take this color
salt tree and again I just taken more
precise brush and I just run that right
through the crease right through the
socket
I have hooded eyelids so it's annoying
but you just got to really really really
blend it all out so of course after this
step you then go back to a blending
brush and you just blend away when you
think you've blended enough keep
blending
I'm taking the shade stand offish from
the same palette and I'm using that from
on my inner tear ducts as a highlight
love the shade it's so pretty
and again it's just a baby pink so it's
sticking with the theme of the
eyeshadows I also run that through the
center of my eyelids just to brighten it
all up I then take this color sleek it's
just a dark brown from the same palette
and I just run that across my lash line
for my lashes so once again I'm taking
the color sultry and I'm running that
underneath my lash line just to
make it all seamless and make the top
match the bottom a bit more and then
once you've done of course take your
mascara and I just lightly like to coat
my lashes with the top part of this
mascara just provides a nice light coat
just to give your lashes something to
sit on
so the lashes I'm using today the
whiskey's by Ardell and I just applied
them off the cameras so I'm just running
a light layer of mascara through my
lashes again just to connect to mine to
the fake ones and going straight on to
bronzer I just like to use a mid-sized
brush I'll list it down below but I just
use that as a transition shade for my
contouring so I just warm up my skin and
provide just a nice and close sunkissed
glow again this just makes your contour
blend a lot easier and it doesn't make
make it look like it's just two lines
drawn on your face and make your
cheekbones
Oh
so once I've bronzed my skin I go into
the ac-12 or contour and highlighting
kit and I take the two dark bottom
colors and then I just run that
underneath my cheekbones so from the top
of my ear down towards my lips just
ending before I hit the corner
I this just creates a nice color shadow
for your treatments I also take that
across the top of my forehead and
underneath my jawline just to bring some
dimension back into my face I also take
the same shades just down the sides of
my nose just to thin it out a little bit
so just taking any blush I took the
gorgeous cosmetics blush it's just a
nice peachy shade I'm just putting that
on the apples of my cheeks and then
blending upwards I like to take mary lou
manizer by the balm as my highlight and
I'm just running that over my cheekbones
on the tip of my nose on my Cupid's bow
my forehead
so to stick with the pink theme I'm
taking Savi's lip pencil and the lip
liner and I'm just running that all over
my lips so I'm outlining the outside of
them and then just feeling them in as
well just a really nice putting nude
pinky color Oh after you filled your
lips in just going with this NYX butter
gloss and just run that all of your lips
just to create a really nice Sheen and
that's the finished look I hope you guys
have enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
