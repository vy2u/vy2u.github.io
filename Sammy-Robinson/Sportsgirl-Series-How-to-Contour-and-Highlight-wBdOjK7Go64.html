today's video as you can tell by the
title down below is a collaboration with
sports girls it is sort of the beginning
of my sports girl series I'm doing a few
videos with them on their beauty
products and if you get ready with me
using their clothes and I'm really
excited about it because I've always
loved sports girls always shop there now
that I think about it's probably the
first makeup I ever bought my strapless
from Sports guide
I remember distinctly it was a bronzer
that was big and I was in a circle with
stripes downside that went out with me
and my friend Dave obsesses it was the
only runs we used for ages so yeah this
is the beginning of my sports girls
period it is a how to contour and
highlight using their products and I'm
absolutely in love with them so you guys
know me the number one goal to me when I
use makeup is to use products that will
be as lightweight as possible and give
me the most natural effect as possible
and be sort of as radiant and
comfortable so these products definitely
do do that they are really nice
lightweight products they don't feel
heavy on the skin and they give you a
really beautiful glow and I make sure to
leave all the links to all the products
that I use down below in the description
box if you guys want to check anything
else I hope you guys enjoy the video and
let's get started so to begin no matter
what I always always will start off the
primer I feel like when you start with
the primer it makes everything easier to
apply it on top of it so I'm going to
use the sports girls time to cry and
primer first just put additional amount
of this all over my face
this was nice because it's really
illuminating and then also really
moisturizing what on my face and excuse
my hair I've just jumped on showers oh
it's all wet I look like a boy but good
we're focusing on the face as it would
be just tie my hair back anyway now
familiy when I do contour and
highlighting especially using cream part
I don't like to use much foundation
underneath so I'm going to put a tiny
bit of the foundation on but not too
much because otherwise everything tends
to layer up on top of each other too
much and ends up being quite cakey
so my tips for cream contouring is to
apply a tiny
foundation because basically essentially
all you want to do is even a skin tone
we use the face based foundation in the
shade medium and I'm just using a little
bit this is sort of half a pump so far
and we can build it up as we go and I'm
using their Beauty sponge as well to
blend this in this is huge so I've been
trialing out all these sports girl
products for probably God it would be
before Christmas probably probably
around 2 months now and I am really
really impressed with it you can build
it up however you want how intensely you
want your foundation and how much
coverage you are very subjective you can
build it up to however heavy you would
like it next is you can feel so I like
to do the light parts first because then
I find it easier to blend dark over the
top of light so I'm going to take the a
double trouble contour wand I'm using
the medium one and I like to take the
concealer and use it in a triangle
underneath my eyes brightening the under
eyes because obviously we get really
tired and dull under the under eyes and
then it also obviously conceals any bags
under your eyes I like to put it on my
chin down the bridge of my nose and on
my forehead so I'm going to take the
same beauty sponge and just below that
in I was actually very pleasantly
surprised by this concealer it's super
like not super super full coverage but
it does an amazing job I'd cover in any
dark circles cuz I have quite ducts as
you can see in contrast a very dark
circles but then also very dark islands
so it does an amazing job at covering so
now as you can see my face is pretty
white compared to my body and then quite
um blank I say so there's not much going
on what I've been doing with my explore
girl products which I've been actually
taking two different sort of
rundas cream contour products I take the
other end of the concealer and I warm
the outer perimeter of my face up first
and then I take this contour stick which
is a little bit cooler toned and then I
strategically contour my face so I'm
going to begin using the other end of
the one at the main so the main point of
this is to warm up my foundation because
it is a little light for me I'll take
the other end of the beauty sponge again
and I'll begin to just blend that into
the skin to be you don't have to be too
precise with this because all we're
doing is warming up the foundation so
you can pretty roughly just blend that
in all over the skin so now I'm going to
take this product I actually this is
become one of my everyday routine
products I love the shade of this
contour stick so I'm going to take this
to further defined my face can you see
those two little more cool tones and
when we use before and now we take their
buffing brush I love this because the
bristles are so short and so densely
packed it's so easy to blend our cream
contour with this so yeah I'm just going
to boil and let in there did you see how
easily that happened I cannot rave
enough about this brush okay so now
before the concealer creases I'm going
to take their banana setting powder and
I'm just going to set my under eyes and
all the highlighted points of my face
don't want to set the creases the key
for me and a tip from me is that I
always use a little bit of everything
I'm not except for the concealer every
hand when we concealer but um I'm not
into using excessive amounts of every
product I like to use a little bit of
foundation a little
a cream bronzer and if you need to add
more it's better to go that way by
adding little bits at a time instead of
going overboard and creating a KC mess
on your face so as you can see it looks
very natural and it looks very subtle on
my skin but it's still giving me so much
dimension and I'm like a very healthy
complexion I'm going to jump on to their
time to define a contour palette and I'm
going to start contouring with the brown
powder I'm going to take sort of sort of
a mixture of these two
I start I like to start from the top of
my ear here and go towards this part of
my lip but I finished halfway in between
when my eye and so around this half way
through my cheek so if you feel like
that coat will go a bit messy just take
a bit of the banana and light shades
with your brush and just roll that
directly underneath and it will clean up
your contour for you but I like the on
the glow Sunkist palette because it has
because shape in it and I like this one
just up here and begin highlighting this
highest point of my face so I take it
over my cheekbones you guys see how
goodbye my life is like these products
are no joke so as you guys can see
putting shimmer over the tee grows and
it just lifts the cheekbone up and makes
you look like you've got like a really
high lifted cheekbone which I certainly
don't I've got a round potato face I
love taking the contour blender and you
take a little bit of the same shade you
run it directly down the center just
here in a straight line and make a
little exclamation on your nose so you
go down here and then on the tip and
that'll give the illusion of a little
button nose and a really thin nose
and then on the inner two dots on the
Cuban slow her cruise user so now I'm
going to take some of their sports go
bleep big fiber lash mascara this one
has fibers in it so it's let's make our
lashes look super super long
I always get mascara everywhere like how
did I manage this there in there okay so
that is the finished result I hope you
guys found this little step-by-step how
to contour and highlight easy
make sure the stick around for my next
sports go videos I have a few more
coming out in my sports car series and I
will see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
