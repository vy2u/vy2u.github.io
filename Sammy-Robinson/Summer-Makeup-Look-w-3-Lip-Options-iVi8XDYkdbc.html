today I've filmed my go to summer makeup
look this is the makeup that I tend to
go to every night when I'm going out
with friends or if I'm going on a date
it's just a really light makeup look
that's super easy to do I do it in like
10 minutes and it just is so comfortable
in this hot weather in summer
um and I've paired it with three
different lip options for you guys so
you can see what it looks like with
different lip colors this is probably my
favorite lip color though during summer
this all nude obviously cuz nudes really
easy but I think orangey-red colors are
just so vibrant and bright in summer and
it just makes any makeup look look so
polished so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
the makeup look and if you want to see
how I created it then just keep watching
so today I'm using my Laura Mercier
foundation primer in radiance and I'm
going to mix a tiny bit of my J bronze
shimmer instant illuminizer with that
going with the tiniest bit of foundation
just around my t-zone because I do have
redness around here at the moment so I'm
going to take my NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation in the shade sorry
Syracuse sorrow coos and take my damp
Beauty Blender and I'm just going to
push that into my skin
so to conceal the bags under my eyes I'm
taking my makeup forever
Ultra HD concealer in the shade Y 31 I
think so I've just dotted that concealer
under my eyes and I'm just going to take
the other end of my Beauty Blender and
just learn that in so in summer I don't
have to use too much foundation or
concealer because I still like to be
able to see my skin come through you
know the foundation so I only use really
light amount on sort of the center of my
face just to conceal any redness and
obviously my dark circles under my eyes
so now I'm taking my AC on to a contour
and highlighting kit and I'm willing to
take a bit under shade and just set my
under eyes because in some of my under
eyes crease quite a bit just because
it's so humid I'm going to go in with my
favorite product at the moment it's the
Bobbi Brown pot Rouge for lips and
cheeks in blushed rose it is a cream
blush and it is also sort of kind of a
tent for your lips it's a really deep
color but I love to take that and put it
directly on the apples of my cheeks and
it makes you look super super flushed
and almost a little bit sunburned so I
like to just take a little bit of that
product and just dab it onto my skin
with my fingers for bronze I'm going to
take my makeup forever a pro sculpting
duo and I'm going to take the bronze
shade down the bottom and just lightly
warm up the outer perimeter of my face
and to highlight I'm going to take the
top shade of the same makeup ever pro
sculpting Jew pan and I'm going to
highlight the high points of my face so
I'm putting a little bit above my
eyebrow on my brow bone and I put some
on the tip of my nose
and just down the bridge you just ease
and I put a little bit on my inner tear
duct and my phone keeps going so to make
life super easy and really quick I take
exactly the same products that I used on
my face so I take the brown shade and I
put that through my crease and then I
take the gold shade and I put that on my
lid I'm going to take my Sigma e-40
blending brush and take the bronzer
shade under bottom and lightly run that
through my crease
and then I just take my finger and the
gold chain and run that all in my eyelid
and then just refuse the two colors with
your blending brush I like to take the
lighter shade so the shimmery shade and
I actually like to run that on my lower
lash line closer to the inner corner I
just feel like that really opens up your
eyes I don't like to put dark shades on
my lower lashes because I feel like it
makes my eyes look super droopy so for
mascara I'm going to take my they're
real tinted primer from benefit and I'm
going to run a light layer of that all
through my lashes my new favorite combo
for mascara is definitely the dayroom
primer with the their real mascara you
can get your lashes so massive using
these two products so during the day
that's where I stop with my mascara I
just put a coat of the they're real
tinted primer on it because it's brown
it looks way more natural during the day
but at nighttime I like to put a layer
of their real mascara from benefit over
the top of it just adds a lot more drama
to your lashes
and again I like to steer clear a bottom
mascara on my bottom lashes because I
feel like it just makes my eyes look
really droopy so I want them to look
more awake and open so to finish off the
face I like to take my Urban Decay D
slick makeup setting spray it's for oily
skin so it's supposed to keep your face
looking it's nice and matte and I do go
quite oily in summer so I like to make
sure I put a setting spray of the top so
now for the exciting part we're going to
do the lipstick I am sure you guys have
heard a few people talking about these
new lipsticks from Rimmel it's the only
one range and it's a new hybrid formula
it's basically the creamiest lipstick I
own it glides on so smoothly and is so
pigmented so I'm going to show you guys
three different lip options and magic
fillip liners first thing about these
lipsticks is that they are so long
wearing I was trying all my all of them
on because I've got sent a few from the
range and the only issue with drying
funnel at the same time was I couldn't
actually get them off even if it fully
comes off it leaves you with the nicest
stained sort of appearance on your lips
so I'm going to show you three different
lip options a pink a red and a new so
the lipsticks are really long wearing
they're really comfortable to wear under
both the best part for me is that
they're actually really moisturizing
there's nothing worse than when you have
a lipstick that is so drying on your
lips and it gets stuck in your cracks
and things like that so they're super
super moisturizing it's as if you're
putting on a lip balm but it has the
most intense color payoff as well so I'm
going to start off by showing you the
pink option so I'm going to take the lip
liner in 102 peachy beachy
can you guys see how even pigmented that
lipliner is
can you see that oh my god that's insane
and then I'm going to take the shade 120
you're all mine
and I'm going to run that over the top I
did run a peachy beat you all over my
lips just to give a sort of more vibrant
base to lighten this color up a little
bit so that's number one that's what
you're all mine it looks like it's
honestly I kind of describe how
moisturizing this lipstick is like it
honestly just feels like an wearing
purple cream or like a really soft lip
balm on my lips so for option two I'm
going to show you a nude look this is
probably what I would pair normally with
this eye makeup because I'm just such a
nude fanatic so I just find it really
easy just to check on a nude lipstick
and it's just easy to maintain during
the night so in my favorite nude shade
from this line is seven hundred naughty
nude with my Rimmel exaggerate lip liner
in the shade 105 under my spell which
this is a dark sort of berry
I don't like nudes that are too light I
like to just give my lips a bit of
definition first so I go through a bit
of an ombre a sort of very nude if that
makes sense so I lightly line my lips
with this not I don't press too hard
because I want to be really subtle
and then I take my Rimmel lipstick in
700 naughty nude and I'm just gonna run
that all over my lips
so can you see how a naughty nude has a
bit of a berry undertone to it anyway if
my favorite and go to nude is a brownie
up or a bit of a darker nude goes really
well with any makeup look in my opinion
though that's just the easy option if
you guys wanted to go for a nude so I
thought I was filming but I wasn't and
I've all I've done is apply the lip
liner to my bottom lip I started with
the lip liner in 104 call me crazy
which is just the most beautiful oranjee
red
so you could even stick to just this
lipliner this is what the lipliner on
its own looks like it's such a beautiful
vibrant orange you read but and that
gives you a matte finish but if you want
to add a bit of a sheen over the top and
a more moisturizing finish and I'm going
to apply the lip the lipstick 500 red
revolution over the top of it
so that just makes the color that much
more intense and that much more vibrant
and really moisturizing as well so it
feels really comfortable of lips this
would have to be my favorite color if I
was to wear color on my lips during
summer because I just think orangey Reds
are the most beautiful color on so many
different complexions so many different
skin tones it just brightens up any
makeup look and makes it look so summery
and fresh so that's the end of this
