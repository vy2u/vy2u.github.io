so I just put a light layer of my Becca
Apple in this silk foundation on I
thought I would film a get ready with me
so that's all of them so far I'm just
going to allow them the musical tonight
so I'm just going with my mom and my
sister so I'm just going to do actually
have no idea want me to do but I thought
I would just get the camera and film but
yeah so there's a waist me just sitting
here and doing my makeup if I wasn't
gonna film it for you guys what's not
ways because I do my makeup quite often
well um I just felt like I have an hour
to get ready so why not so I'm just
going to take my Urban Decay Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
in the shade medium neutral yes there me
and I'll give it a light to shade light
warm as well just because I feel like
I'm needs to be a little bit brighter
and I'm taking my Beauty Blender just
too little in midian
so I have no idea what look I'm going
for
I think I'm in a so creepy vortex
Rembrandt as mom and Katie but knowing
me I get really carried away and I'll
probably and that was like full glam I'm
so excited to see about it I love love
musicals live it's honestly like one of
my favorite things to do is go to go
watch musicals I just get so into it I
just like really feel the music now I'm
going to take my lord Mathia powder as
always and beg my undereyes basically my
undereyes used to be a really rare thing
for me to do like only when I go out but
I just feel like it keeps my concealer
looking so good so I kind of just do it
when I'm ready my makeup now
lights that money season as well because
it's super hot in Sydney at the moment
so someone gets sweaty now I'm going to
take my shallow tool brietta brush
flawless finish
affecting micro powder in shade dark so
it's kind of more like a bronzer but I'm
going to take a big fluffy brush and
just sort of set my whole out of
Chimaera in my face is it
so that'll sort of set the foundation
down but then also give me like a little
bit of color I'm going to take this goal
and terracotta bronzer in the shade
there is two Naturals becomes just a
little darker sort of sharp a little
more so I've been really into Pilates as
I might like I mentioned it a few times
to you guys but I'm literally obsessed
with that I've been doing every single
day and the guys as you guys know not
being very interested eyes and I don't
often go to the gym ever heard the gym
so finding Pilates has been like the
best thing ever for me because it makes
me feel so good about myself you know
like exercising obviously makes me feel
really good
but I just hated going so this is so
much finding something that works for me
if any of you guys are wondering where I
go I go to K X Pilates and it's the
Pilate that they do on the revolver so
you lay down on the chair
and like do heaps of different exercises
you can straps and balance boards and I
don't know what this correct terminology
here for it is but it's just so much fun
and I just love it now I'm taking my
client's blush in the shade 0-2 soft
peach which looks like this it's a
really light pink clay and good stuff
that over my cheeks wearing my hair out
you guys probably my lighter you take my
Becca champagne pop it's like the flip
parents of this duo wherever it's cold
and I'm just taking the highlight shade
and using that on the tops of my
cheekbones that is probably the most
intense highlight I own background up
highlighters if you want something
that's intense and that's going to show
up get the best ones that it doesn't
even have to be champagne pop it can be
opal or moonstone they all show up like
in crevel to make you glow like nothing
else if you watched my recent blog you
guys would have seen
that sent a whole bunch of color pops
sort of individual shadows and they're
the ones that sort of like this way down
and I'm just going to try a whole bunch
of them today I don't really feel like
doing my solo button so they want to try
them so I'm going to start with the
shade and note to self and use that as a
transition a roll a lot comes off when
you go in nice and close super pigmented
and whoa
they are super blendable did you guys
see how quickly that just bind it out I
literally had to pick up nothing and
that just came through right off and
blended so easily so I'm going to pick
up some of this shade called paper
target if I can get this really cool
shade and I'm going to add some of that
into my crease as well
no I will pick up some of this shade
called save it for later now I'm going
to take a little bit of the first shade
which was note to self and I'm going to
run a bit of that on my lower lash line
I feel like doing like this smoke
dancers burnt-orange II look now to
deepen it up a little bit I'm going to
take the shade top notch and I'm going
to put a bit of top notch into my own V
so I just got a whole bunch of my
glasses order delivered and your whole
with their stuff I get a whole bunch of
questions from you guys asking where I
get my basics or my like plain tops and
so I just got a whole bunch of stuff
from there to show you guys what I wear
like a portable basic type thing so now
we need use the Garbo and Kellie eyebrow
pencils and I'm just going to lightly
fill in my brows I've been loving this
stuff lately it's the benefit 3d brow
times in the shade number two and run
that through my brows and just brush
them upwards I love this stuff lately
I'm going to take my skill a huge
extreme lash mascara and just coat my
top and bottom lashes I haven't been
into the falsies as much lately
this friend especially if you just to
chuck a business star on
tell me so many of you guys always ask
me like why I never wear my hair out
it's genuinely not because I don't like
my hair out
I'm just so lazy the reason I split it
with I like my hair slicked but the main
reason I like it is because I can't be
bothered to style it line my lips with
my hourglass panoramic lipliner in the
shade Eden
I'll give it wrong my tribe is fun B
Anastasia Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquids of sit in the shade Ashton which
is like kind of a warm toned liquid
lipstick so I think it'll go well with
the eyes or I don't know and I think I'm
a fan of that now when I try this color
pop look at the stick everything does
come off it though so I don't know what
shade it is which I'm very sorry about
but now add a bit of this NARS Velvet
lip guide in stripped over the top it's
a little bit more nude again just in the
center I'm going to add a little bit of
contour and I take my Bahama Mama
bronzer by the balm zoeva face paint
brush and I'm just going to contour a
little bit I suppose I'm a bit washed
out and round also I found this colors
actually Holly's palette but how
beautiful is just so we've a caramel
palette look at the colors in that I
just ran what that was mine that I found
and I was like oh my god how about use
this but no it's all isn't you like to
hear okay so I am I'm doing it dressed
now and if I have time I will fill my
outfit to you guys and show you guys I'm
wearing it's just going to be casual
because obviously it's not a formal
event but I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video and I will see you very
shortly in my next one love you guys
