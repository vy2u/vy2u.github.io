everybody today's video is going to be a
favorites video
I've been talking about doing this for a
few weeks now I'm so excited that I'm
finally doing it because I get to show
you guys all my favourite products at
the moment yeah I'm sitting on my floor
in my bedroom because I felt like it I
just thought it would be perfect in time
for Christmas to maybe give you guys
some ideas of things to buy or some
gifts or out of that get you begin I
thought I would start off with the
fragrance because I haven't showed you
guys any fragrances as of light it's
been a long time since I've talked about
my current favorite perfume so I'm
wearing this one it's my noogler and it
is the angel muse de Parfum Eau de
Parfum parfum good before God
australians just have the most bogan
accents and i can't make anything look
fancy sound fancies firstly how chic is
this packaging i've been wearing it for
the last few weeks now and actually
probably the last few months oh my god
it is heaven it is so good and the thing
that i probably love the most about this
is that it is super strong and like a
lot of perfumes i find fade really
easily and you have to like really layer
it on with this i literally spray one or
two sprays and it lasts ages and it's so
beautiful it's very sophisticated very
elegant scent usually i like to go for
those really fruity citrusy smells but
this one is like oh yeah i don't have to
explain it I can't explain how fumes
I just lost I just which is super
important to me and I've had so many
compliments on it Nick loves it as well
which is always a plus so the next which
is so totally random but I just thought
I would give this trim panel mentioned
um I just love this straight up because
it's got two liters of capacity in it
and it makes me drink two liters of
water a day which is freakin awesome
I've been so hydrated because of it next
up is my Kate Spade bag I love this
because ii think i got it when I was in
New York I got it at the flagship store
New York and the reason I love this is
because it is so like wide at the bottom
and it fits so much in it like you can
see that it's not that big but it's big
enough that I can put my vlogging camera
in my wallet my phone mints glasses
everything often with a lot of my about
other bags I find that I have to carry
my camera or carry my glasses and it's
just so annoying it completely defeats
the purpose of having a bag so this one
is just like the best sized bag that
I've ever gotten and the cutest color as
well I wanted a baby pink bag so long
then moving on to some skincare oh my
god my favorite moisturizers right now
and the skincare products that have
saved my skin while I've been traveling
is the clinic Moisture Surge pleural
moisture surges so this one is the face
mask and it's called the Moisture Surge
overnight mask I put this on what I like
get on the plane all of my face it's
just a nice thick layer of it and the
coolest thing is you can sleep in it so
I just slept in it it just looks like a
thick moisturizer like it's not it
doesn't have a color to it don't you
can't even say that you're wearing it
really hydrating and getting into your
skin and replenishing your skin and
that's why I love it on a flight because
it kind of acts as a barrier to all the
pollution and aircon and everything
that's going around in the airplane so
then when I land which is like 12 hours
later or so I take it off and my skin is
like softer than when I got on the plane
it's so nice as well as that my favorite
everyday moisturizer is the Clinique
Moisture Surge extended thirst relief
and as you can see I'm running out so
clinic if you want to send me a no just
take it it definitely will repurchase
it's so good for summer it's essentially
like a gel based formula so it's not
really thick and creamy it doesn't make
you feel like Whaley or like you've got
something on your face it just soaks in
just give a really nicely then a few
brushes that I want to mention I feel
like I never mentioned brush
so I just wanted to give a few Russians
I mentioned these are two different
brands well this one is so even I just
this one I just love for contouring and
getting in and bronzing up like little
areas of the face but the reason I was
just going to bring this one up is
because just zoeva brushes in general
are the bomb.com and often when you see
me using brushes I probably will most
likely forget to tell you what I'm using
so I just thought in today's video I'd
let you know that's a waver brushes rock
this one is the luxe powder finishing
brush which is just awesome for
contouring and this would also be I'd
get another one of these actually and
would be so good to sit under the eyes
everything like that so yes and then
this brush by Clinique all my goodness
so it's basically a kabuki brush and a
duo fiber brush so it's got a really
thick dense bottom bit there and then it
goes off and fans off into jus a fiber I
use this for everything foundation cream
bronzers yeah cream blushes cream
highlighters it just diffuses what IB
you're wearing it's super super nicely
like really quickly blended in and it is
 awesome another product which I
actually got seven ages ago and only
picked up recently because I was trying
to find a new contour shade and I've
always just go through my kit and go
well what's new like what can I pick up
that's new and I love this guy sorry
this is teeny Galvan Kelly powder and
cream contour kit and I use this as a
cream bronzer it is so awesome and
really dark so really like deep ends and
contours really nicely this is amazing I
contouring the cheeks and this is
amazing at setting the under eyes and
also this blush is a really beautiful
neutral shade that is so natural but
this literally looks like you're
flushing another makeup product which I
have been using every single day and
like actually pretty much every single
day is this triple protection skin tint
by hallow fab
and it has Gaucho berries and there's an
SPF of 30 so oh my god pins needles aah
oh my god
it's probably just amazing it is pretty
much just a skin tint it's like you can
see it's quite dark so I just put a lot
there on my hand and swish it all over
my face with a brush like this and it is
just so good it just makes my skin all
one color really even and it evens out
my skin tone to match like my body
because my body always get darker it's
perfect for every day because it has an
SPF of 30 in it it gives you like that
light wash of healthy glowy color as
well as sunscreen which is freaking a
plus my books another makeup product
that I've been loving is this Sigma lose
the halo lip concealer this is my
favorite concealer at the moment it's my
favorite everyday concealer oh my god
guys I still have been needles
oh it's not going away oh my god breathe
it's the most pigmented concealer I've
ever tried maybe you know I've tried but
you know what I mean like I wear this on
an everyday basis because all I have to
do is like tap my finger in there get
like the tiniest bit of product you
don't never be able to tell because it's
getting time let's get College just put
it around the darkness under my eyes and
in my inner corner I can wear it to the
gym it's so good lightweight because
literally the pigment on this is so
crazy that you have to use the target
amount ain't never creases I said it
with just like a little bit of powder
but like it looks like my skin it's the
perfect shade the best everyday
concealer because it just doesn't feel
like you're wearing makeup and I often
find with a lot of other concealers that
I use if I just put the concealer there
it just looks so weird compared to my
other skin that you have like this weird
circle of concealer and then just
nothing whereas if you put this on and
you just go like right under there and
in here and just conceal it it blends to
your skin so seamlessly it doesn't look
like you're wearing makeup I don't then
lastly is my herbivore rose hibiscus
coconut water hydrating face mist I just
keep this on my table next to where I
edit and when I feel hot my so flustered
I just spray it on my face and just
refreshes me rejuvenates me just in
summer something like this is really
refreshing it smells good it just kind
of wipes me up a little bit there's a
truck outside so that is loud anyways I
hope that you guys have enjoyed this
