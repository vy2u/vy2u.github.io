say I am walking out the door right now
because we're doing the workshop
challenge today got to take those snacks
I'll show you guys my new furniture oh
my god here's my new furniture that's my
old stuff over there so that's thinking
on that I got this beautiful couch so
that I can sit out here and have wine
it's Lou's beautiful table down low on
today yeah I'm on my way to pick up my
sister we're gonna be doing the thrift
shop challenge I'm pretty sure I
mentioned this briefly to you guys in my
last video it looks like a lot of fun so
I thought why not do something really
different something I haven't done
before yeah and I thought it would be
fun to bring my sister into it so you
can get a little bit more of a pastor
who came to my family my life she's
coming with me to Europe so you guys
will probably see her hips in that as
well so I've got my okay kombucha in
ginger and tumeric this one's my
favorite flavor right now my favorite
brand of kombucha I just have to show
you guys later what I do with it when I
make cocktails I make a kombucha
cocktail and I put like all of the
kombucha and with vodka and they keep
some fresh berries and orange slices and
lemon and mint and stuff it's really
yummy I will get you what are you doing
in there
what are you doing in there she's waited
isn't she
all right have fun
oh my god I'm obsessed with her she's so
old I cannot even deal with her bye I've
acquired one sister and we're on our way
hi hi I film the whole deal yes I'm so
gay
how do you usually do it we usually do
on me this is my second favorite sister
Jemima I'm hey Katy Katy like a cake can
Katy the letters Katy all right and how
old are you this is this or shocks
everyone 16 why do you think I'm 12
yeah she'll always be 12 in my eyes six
years younger than me everyone always
thinks that we're twins but no she's
actually like six which I mean either
that's a compliment to me saying that I
young this tastes like this ginger I
didn't say before but this ginger don't
you write exactly what it tastes like um
are you still in school I'm 16 yeah
are you didn't finish school no I'm
dropping at the end of the year okay
we'll be finishing school I'm doing my
day
are you actually yeah yeah yeah I am
well information it Katie that requires
a lot of languages have you ever studied
the language in your life pig latin pig
latin
mm-hmm look white that's because I'm
very orange anyway so I've already
prefaced this video we're about to drive
off and do a thrift shop challenge so
we're gonna give ourselves to begin with
a $25.00 like limit that's our challenge
but I'm saying that when I
used to buy all my clothes from their
shops it would be like 20 dollars each
for an item usually like if you found
something cool like a good Barrett good
pair of jeans it would be like 30 bucks
still from the thrift shop try to find
an outfit that we think is really cool
and we would want like when you actually
wear all right stop number one and
hopefully the only stop if we're
successful
these are actually like kind of sick
with their prescriptions I can't see
anything like the races what look basic
try that up you can't see anything it's
completely blurred I don't know why
people don't buy their work shirts at
places like this look at that it's more
selection for men okay all right get out
of that section that's what I always do
yeah better with other ones how does one
have so many because it is 1 2 3 4 5
actually is a really good selection here
why although finding shoes to fit out
giant face not sure about that you're
doing well so far I think you've nailed
brief I think me too you know what now
that you say it I think I'm the same if
you go for this type of vibe like that
really son safe I leave I've got a break
split split bro
okay so update I basically just remember
the busting to grab the toilet so Hayden
Louise that toilet so I'm gonna drive to
a cafe go into a cafe and we're just
gonna change locations that place didn't
have anything that great for either of
us so we're gonna go to the crow's nest
Vinny's as well and then so I can pee
all right take two let's do this this is
definitely the one for sure what do you
think of it hmm hmm okay so we have
successfully finished well successfully
or unsuccessfully mine are a little bit
wack that's fine
we're just got a protein smoothie now um
and some sushi for lunch we're gonna
head back to our house Kate's house mom
dad's house and tried all of you guys so
successful it was kind of funny but I
mean I wanted to ideally I wanted to be
able to find like shoes like a hats and
accessories but everything was kind of
expensive that was cool Sam so took us
through it so she's sick as well so if
you can't hear her do you owe me to talk
yeah
yeah all right so she's gone for
something that she would normally wear
on an everyday basis which I think she's
killed it she's got some awesome Levi's
jeans so turn around which has the cool
patch Levi's and just a plain basic
t-shirt which is actually very soft that
she would wear with so many different
outfits so I think she's nailed it and
it came to $26 didn't it adult over but
I think you'll actually get wear out of
this stuff which is cool
okay so this was I think this $15 she
cut at a go I can check on the receipt
but stop it oh my god so I got this
because I'm basically I wanted to style
it
so it has shoulder pads which is like
crazy and oh those shoulder pads are
cool and I think I'll ever wear with the
shoulder pads and it is a little bit
long so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna cut it now cut the shoulder pads
out and style it differently and I'll
show you
okay so I've cut it and taking the
shoulder pads out I've just like rolled
up the sleeves and it's kind of cool
what do you think yes cool I feel like I
would wear yeah anyone pretty sure this
was $10 this was $15 I'm pretty sure
this made 25 yeah you could wear that
it's cute this one's kind of wack I'm
back I really liked this and I wanted to
do like a little white t-shirt under and
wear it as a dress I am quite tall so I
might not be able to pass this is a
dress I mean it's not okay it's not like
give me exactly my arms up it's not that
short like if I was to wear a skirt it
would be this like they think it's just
because it's like a 1 getting in is
quite short but I feel like this was
like little pair of white things is kind
of cute something a little bit different
I thought what while we're making a
challenge of it I really know it's cool
step out of my comfort zone a little bit
with that but and the little white
t-shirt was five actually no it was four
and then
I was 15 so 19 dollars for this outfit
so I thought I'd just show you the last
one that I got this one more so it was
just a job that I wanted for myself but
I couldn't for the life of me find a
good pair of shorts so I've got these
little $4 black shorts and this's was it
10 yeah I think so
probably a bit more of a team option I
just love this jumper it's got like
these big bell sleeves like the ones I
designed and it's just like such a vibe
you know I'm by but in vibe with this
jumper that say I know I'm gonna wear
this all right well um I'm probably
gonna say that Kate won cuz I think she
got the most normal outfit that she's
actually gonna wear her but you guys let
us know it can't come below what you
thought I tried to step out of my
comfort zone at least and do something
different I actually think this is
really cool and I'm gonna wear it with
like I'll probably wear it open with a
pair of like grungy denim shorts and
then it'll look a little bit more normal
I think as a dress it is a bit funny so
thanks for coming in my video thumbnail
I really Trisha Paytas also just break
up with Jason what actually yeah watch
all the videos on that drama actually
runs all day actually yeah they break up
she looks really like she might got with
him I'm pretty sure
