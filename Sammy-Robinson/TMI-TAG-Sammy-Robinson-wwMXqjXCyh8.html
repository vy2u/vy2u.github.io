you so much for watching today I'm
filming the TMI tag so basically what
the TMI tag is is there's about there's
50 questions and basically I just answer
them so it's kind of like a get to know
me video sort of so yeah let's just jump
straight into it so question number one
what are you wearing um I'm just wearing
this top from glasses it's just sort of
like a mid roof top and I'm wearing just
baggy black pants and ugg boots question
number two have you ever been in love um
yes I have been in love number three
have you ever had a terrible breakup um
no I haven't had a terrible breakup but
I did just recently break up with my
boyfriend so um yeah it wasn't terrible
we entered fine but um he's the only
boyfriend I've ever had so no I haven't
had a terrible breakup but yeah before
how tall are you I'm very tall I'm 5
foot 11 which I have no idea how many
centimeters that is um because I just go
off feet so yeah I'm 5 foot 11 how much
do you weigh
I have not dear and I'm not answering
that question
any tattoos um no I have no tattoos I
don't know if I would get a tattoo um I
have nothing against them but I always
wanted one but I don't know if I would
actually ever go through with it
so yeah no tattoos as of yet but I don't
think I would ever have one either any
piercings yeah I have two piercings just
up here so I have one ring and then one
stud just above it and it's black it's a
Swarovski crystal so it's kind of random
I want to change it to a ring um and I
have these two pierced just like the
normal ones pierced as well but um I
never wear them so pretty sure it's just
closed up benign favorite show um
probably Jory sure like Keeping Up with
the Kardashians I want I watch a lot of
trash TV so yeah um I did enjoy orange
is the new black as well so
watch that on Netflix um or otherwise
I'm really into The Bachelor at the my
face so yeah no respect for my TV
choices um 12 favorite song I don't have
a favorite song I wouldn't be able to
answer that I love so many so many
different styles of music in different
songs so um I guess if I had to choose
let me choose something yes I like music
like that that's dance with me by Dizzee
Rascal and it's like featuring Calvin
Harris and Chrome or something like that
um but yeah I like music I like music I
got like older music so not so much
mainstream but then again I also enjoy
enjoy listening to mainstream on the
radio so I don't really have a favorite
song I know skipped a few um 13 how old
are you I'm 19 years old
number 15 favorite quality you look for
in a partner
I mean not favorites make that up number
15 quality you look for in a partner um
funny I like tall cuz I'm I'm quite tall
um
handsome just has to be really nice and
it has to treat a girl right I just like
guys that really treat girls really well
and make them feel special so there's
nothing worse than a guy that just is a
dickhead favorite actor um I probably
crush the most on Channing Tatum maybe a
teen favorite color my favorite color is
yellow so I love yellow because it's
just so bright and summery and my whole
flat is like decked out in yellow um
black white and yellow it's not like
completely Hellboy but yeah I love
yellow it's just so bright and happy
number 20 where do you go when you're
sad I just go to my bed and cry
how long does it take you to shower um
that's totally depends they found like
washing my hair and stuff maybe ten
minutes but otherwise five minutes
is that bad I don't know
question 23 have you ever been in a
physical fight um no I haven't and not
even with my sister's really actually I
was never allowed to touch them because
I have two younger sisters um yeah so
I've never allowed to hit them so no not
even with my sisters which I don't even
know if that's normal T's it's just I've
enough I said that but yeah no I've
never been in a physical fight to
question 24 turn-ons
I love making eye contact with people so
um I really like what a guy can hold eye
contact and yes I think that's really
good I think that's really good yeah I
love I love to feel special so um yeah
when a guy just is really protective and
treats you like he's your you're his oh
I make this zero sense in my life yes I
just like I like protective guys and
guys that treat you like you're like the
only girl in the world like just yeah
make you feel really special
I think that's the best feeling
turn-offs um when a guy talks to heaps
of girls at the same time I hate that
like I think arrogance and confidence
are similar things so I really respect a
guy that's really confident but when he
becomes so confident that he's arrogant
and almost puts you down um that's a
turn-off as well the reason I joined
YouTube it was pretty random um I think
I've explained this in one of my other
videos yeah it was just really
spontaneous I just decided one day to
film a video and
put it online and yeah I didn't really
think about the consequences but yeah so
now I'm on YouTube
seven fears I'm pretty scared of just
like normal things like sharks and
spiders doesn't spiders not really
bother me that much actually like if I
see it I'm not going to run to the other
side of the room and scream or anything
like that
well we just got with a dog um but yeah
just when I'm swimming I'd freak get
freaked out by sharks and stingrays
things like that also I have a bit of a
phobia of seaweed so I can't swim in
patches of seaweed because I feel like
there's just going to be some sort of
dangerous sea creature amongst the
seaweed so yeah I've always had a bit of
a fear of that question 29 last time you
said you loved someone um probably two
like my mom on the phone just like a
pile of you meaning behind your youtube
name it's my name
so nothing a revolutionary last book you
read oh man that's bad I don't know okay
right I love reading so that's really
sad
I'm gonna start a book after this video
I'm gonna start a book and then I'll let
you guys know last show you watched The
Bachelor last night on channel 10 last
person you talked to Daisy my best
friend Daisy I just texted her before um

pretty cool rocker chick back in a day

from the TMI tag I'm sorry if it was
really boring there was so many
questions and I just thought I would
