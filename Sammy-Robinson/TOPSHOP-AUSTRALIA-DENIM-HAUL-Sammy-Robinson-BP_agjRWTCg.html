but got like super my face excuse
snoring and digit in the background she
will not leave I try so I'd get off my
bed and she is being a diva to do hi so
today's video is very exciting for me
personally and I know it's exact you go
to if you guys know me you know that
I've been working with Topshop for like
three months now and I did an initial
campaign with them I am sort of their
summer ambassador which is like the
coolest thing ever
what the hell yes also doing insert a
clip of the collaboration I did with
them so you guys can see so I'm sure
some of you would have seen it
but yes I haven't actually properly done
a video on my youtube channel yet so a
whole style video for their clothes I'm
so most Instagram posts and I've done a
videos for them but nothing on my
channel but I mean I was going to sit
down and just do a normal style hole
where I explain everything in detail and
show you and try it on but I think I
want to make it a little funkier and do
sort of a compilation style montage
video because it's going to be a video
on all the different songs jeans at
Topshop though I try all the jeans on
you guys should show you what they look
like on me so you can see sort of how
they look what that what style they are
in case you ever want to inspire some
Topshop jeans such shall have always
been so well known for their jeans
people from everywhere buy jeans from
Topshop and I'm I'm definitely no
exception I've always warned a Jamie
jeans always I've had them for so long
so little fun fact that Topshop is that
in the last year they have sold one pair
of jeans every 10 seconds globally so
that just goes to show how popular the
jeans are a Topshop is I've got such a
great variety of styles
so there's mom jeans baggy jeans tight
jeans skinny jeans high-waisted jeans
there's just so many things you can
choose from but boyfriend jeans and mum
James are definitely becoming my
favorite as well because they're just so
comfortable and they look really cool
like having that baggy jeans is like a
nice little type singlet but yes just
for reference just so you guys know but
if my legs are the biggest part of me
I'm a size 12 and I do have a very big
button so how these are fitting me I'm
not necessarily going to be how they fit
you we're all different world different
peasant sizes everyone's beautiful so
yes without further ado here all the
Jean sizes I will put the names on the
screen so you guys can see what they are
I really hope you guys enjoy this video
thank you so much Topshop for sponsoring
this video you guys are the best I've
loved working with you and yeah enjoy
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
