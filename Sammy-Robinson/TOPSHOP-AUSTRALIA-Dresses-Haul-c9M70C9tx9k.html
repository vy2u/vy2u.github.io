speaking this loud okay can you hear me
now can you hear me now okay so it'll be
fine
hey guys so as you can see I'm in a very
different setting right now I'm actually
at Cardenas place we're going out
tonight and I needed to film this hall
but as I was at home my whole family
walked in and then my son was coming in
putting respectful of my Satanist damn
roses that my recruit so I thought I'd
come here a bit earlier and use her
setup this is not even where she films
but just just got the coolest cute
little apartments so yeah that's why I'm
here put that aside as you can tell
where the title of today's video is a
Topshop Hall I've done a Topshop Hall
before I'll link it down below zeros on
the sea that was all on jeans and so
today's video is actually all about
dresses so for this video I wanted to
incorporate a lot of different styles I
tend to stick to the same thing if you
go through my style you know that I
liked my basics I like my monotone
colors it'll often just be beige black
white grey
casual those dressy there's
sophisticated so that I can accommodate
to all of you guys I hope amazing sense
I think I think I'm probably not like
always but as always everything will be
linked down below I'm making a much more
of a conscious effort to provide all the
links you guys will need and everything
you're curious about down in the
description box and you'll be able to
find it there so yeah that being said
let's jump into the video so I'm kind of
going off the footage I've caught off my
laptop so I've already done Tryon
section of this haul and I haven't
brought the clothes with me to show you
because I already filmed a section of it
actually on me so I'm going off the
videos that I've already done I'm going
to start off with the little pink blazer
that I had it's a nice neutral color if
you know what I mean so it's not going
to be too bright it's not going to be
too out there if you don't like wearing
color all that much I feel like baby
pink is a perfect color for you because
I say it is quite neutral it's kind of
like a beige to me so the reason I love
this dress is because it is quite
versatile you can wear it quite dressy
flip your hair back like I did and wear
it with a nice pair of nude heels or
ultimately you could just check on some
white sneakers and make a really casual
dress so that's what I love about these
dresses I've found a lot of them can be
quite versatile so then next we have at
this little black overall dress so this
is a really subtle way of bringing
overalls into your closet so I feel like
I don't know if it's just me but I feel
like overalls can be quite daunting to
wear I always feel bit strange when I'm
wearing overalls but this little dress
is just such an easy way of
incorporating it so you could wear this
with a little white t-shirt underneath
and some white sneakers and a kabisa
that playschool lives I don't know I
really like that young outfit look and
then maybe you could flip your hair back
and wear some cool science with it and
then it looks more edgy but then also
you could maybe wear a lacy black bra
let make it look quite different with
sandals or heels you can dress it up I
think that would look so cool and then
also I have it be sort of blue velvet
of their rural dress which I just loved
the fabric of this one is so so soft and
really comfortable like I said that the
black one I would do exactly the same
thing with this one I would wear as
little white t-shirt underneath and some
white sneakers or maybe a navy blue bra
that and some heels as well so then next
we had this little strappy black and
white dress it sounds cool because I
actually thought it was going to be
super casual when I ordered it online
yeah I thought it was going to be I
don't know I just pictured it you know
like a casual stress dress with a big
denim jacket over your shoulders and
again quite thick and I always pair
everything with white sneakers probably
has something to do with me having a big
sort of elephant health it actually
surprisingly was quite tight so it
really hugged the figures and in doing
so made it more of a glamorous outfit
because it does hug your figure it does
make it more of a going-out dress and
you can put it with black heels but then
I also loved the stripes make it quite
casual so put it with your denim jacket
and singers and you'll get away with
that as well that's a perfect sort of
picnic attire so the next we have the
Cascade dress and I'd say this is
probably one of my favorite dresses I
picked up surprisingly I actually wasn't
even going to pick this one up but when
I put it on I just felt really good in
it I love ad I feel like it makes
me look really hand coffee is just a
great color it's always in I just feel
like you can't go wrong with khaki but
the reason I love this was because it
was a tight dress and it did to hug your
fingers but it was also a loose dress so
if you feel like you get bloating it has
that awesome tie at the front that was
just so flattering and really
comfortable you think it's the nicest
fabric it felt really good quality it
was really modest really high next but
if I'm going to wear a dress either I'm
going to wear it out but I'm going to
wear with heels or I'm going to wear
with white sneakers I just love that
style I've always loved that look now I
do have a few more loads of style
dresses as well this next silver one is
just incredible this one was probably
the one of them all out there items that
I chose I would never ever think to buy
this but I just think this would be so
cool to wear to an event it's so
different so this sort of metallic silk
style fabric is really coming in at them
I just noticed it in a lot of online
stores and it's actually really cool I
never thought I'd get around it as you
guys know I'm the monotone Queen so I
didn't think I'd ever be into it but I
think it's actually also and this still
worn particularly in a blazer version is
just so edgy where that would just look
hair wear that with your stilettos black
heels and it just it's just so different
I don't know I love it and so then
that's being next word that I didn't
really like it the color on myself I
feel like it sort of washed me out
I do love graves I've always been a fan
of Gray's I student I did not like this
one on me particularly but I did love
the dress itself I just really
appreciated how comfortable it was if I
were like this is the dress that I
imagine if I were to be working in an
office every day I would be wearing
something like this because it is really
cool
and it looks really presentable and
looks like you put heaps of effort in
but it's actually just you just chuck it
on and tie it up at the waist and it's
really easy and effortless the fabric is
really light it's not too hot you can
wear this and then put a jacket over the
top of it and have you feel sandals
stickers whatever you want but and then
finally this last dress this beautiful
orange dress this is probably the most
out-there thing I chose is incredibly
stunning but I just don't know if it
didn't fit me well I don't know if I
needed bigger boob I didn't fill it out
properly it's crazy because it's a
really vibrant out there color sort of
fabric but then it's still fitting with
a really classic classy style so the cut
of the dress is very classic how it
comes down to the three-quarter links
and it's hugs your finger but isn't too
tight like a body con and it comes up
quite high very modest rest and the
fabric is so out there it's like it's
crazy it's just like the coolest dress
yes that was all the dresses there
weren't too many of them I really
enjoyed doing this video and I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much to Topshop -

really hope you guys did enjoy it I hope
