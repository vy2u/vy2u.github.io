channel so today's video is going to be
a global poll as you can tell by the
title leaving for France in like a day's
time and I wanted to get this video
filmed for you guys before I left this
video will most likely be up either
while I'm in France after I get back
from France just depending on my
internet and everything like that but
yes I still wanted to film it just so
that I had the content and also I've had
as if you guys have watched my vlogs
you've probably seen that I've had the
clothes on my floor in the box was so
long I've been holding myself back from
wearing a majority of them just because
often when I do that I lose it all
I live in a family of all girls and even
my things end up in my brother's room as
well so I didn't want my little fake
sisters stealing my clothes sorry to
give you the dogs what is I'm just
having the worst like we feel me I swear
yes and saying I have won a few of these
things and I'm pretty sure that I have
everything here I mean I could not
remember because I got them a little
while ago I got them before Bali
if I am missing anything but hopefully
I'm not I think I've got everything so
yes let's just jump into the video as
always everything will be linked down
below in the description box if you guys
want to purchase any of the things that
I got I believe I have a discount code
as well as always I don't know what the
discount code is right now but it will
be on the screen and in the description
box below so you guys can check that out
if you are wanting to do some shopping
right starting off one of the things
that I have been wearing and I had to be
careful to remember this I almost forgot
is these white jeans I have just been
into really baggy jeans recently I
always feel so comfortable in them like
putting them with tight tops and just
not having my legs so on show at
everything like wearing tight jeans as
much and a tight top I prefer to show
off my waist and my upper body you know
that I've got much going on next in
absolutely no particular order I got
this little two-piece you guys might
have seen if you watched my barley blog
or saw or any of my photos
Mike I remember I would have storied it
and he
I got this cute crocheted top and shorts
I wear the crocheted top a lot more than
I wear the shorts as I said I'm not the
biggest fan of my legs so I don't like
to wear things that are too tight all
the time but these are just really cute
to check on in summer definitely mostly
off the top I've worn this actually
heaps of times with different skirts and
damn shorts next I got this really cute
little cha-cha skirt
these are super in at the moment I saw
them all over heaps of people's websites
and I just really loved them I love
Chaumont skirts I love anything that's
cha-cha I always feel so sexy in it I
love ging hat is a tie say it again yeah
Jun yang Jin Jin ho Jin Young gingham of
gingham I think it's gang um but I love
the print but it's just for the cute
wearing this is a little white midriff
and sneakers mixed another thing that
I've actually been wearing heaps which
is so cool and I love that I can wear it
in the summer or winter is this little
jump up I wouldn't even call it a jumper
it's like almost a crochet big baggy
long sleeve because it's not necessarily
that warm but with the weather that
we're in at the moment I didn't want to
do home so it kind of looks like a
jumper but it's got these awesome Flair
sleeves and I just like that it's not
too long while wearing this again with
the choker and sometimes wallets is my
idea of a cool out of it these jeans I
have seen on like Fox we take every
single time I've shopped on there every
single time they've been sold out these
are so popular on their site I'm pretty
sure they've been there for years but I
finally saw that they're in stock now I
was like you know what for old times
sake I'm gonna purchase these and see
how they look I'm still super into
ripped jeans I love having big rips in
the knees yeah I just I just have seen
these so often and I wanted to pick some
up next I got this little cute holts
neck mmm excuse me talk to that little
silver sparkly top I don't really own
anything like this and it's not I
generally like to stick quite monochrome
don't do anything to jazzy but I thought
this was so cute my love halter necks I
just think that they're really
flattering having hopes next you know
you're back on show
I'm sorry second my throat and this is
the really cool jeans short skirts
anything really so it's very versatile
next similarly to the black crochet pair
that I got I bought another little set
so this one is sort of a brownie
dusty rosy orange II actually wouldn't
even know how to describe this color but
it's very unique color it's really cool
again for summer and again I really like
the top probably the most it's just I
just love the crochet it's really thick
sturdy fabric really good quality and
you guys know I probably have a little
bit of sesame with off-the-shoulder
things it's kind of getting a bit
ridiculous now tops my thing right now
I'm just getting so around top so every
time I see a top on that I'm like I will
take that and not that that that all of
them actually you know what add them all
to my card
next in every hole I swear I always say
this but I've got to pick up a little
ply playing black dress I loved this
because of the straps you guys probably
know that I'm obsessed with really thin
spaghetti like straps and I think the
cool thing about this is you can add so
much with it sounds like a little white
t-shirt underneath and I think it would
make it quite casual thank you even I
just love to look of a really messy high
bun like this with a little dress like
this
maybe like a bold red lip gets really
cute yes stuff I got this really cute
through to piece this also I have seen
around a lot and I just wanted to get my
hands on one that was with the cute with
like a bit of a different pattern I
really thought that I wasn't gonna like
the shorts score skirt thing on me
again because I don't like my links that
much go to it's like a bash baby bash
their video seems like I'm talking
really badly about myself I don't not
like my legs it's just that I know other
things suit me more I suppose but I
actually really found these really
flattering and I quite liked my legs in
them which is like exciting for me I
like finding a pair of shorts or a skirt
that I feel it's quite flattering on my
legs just like okay I'm next this I
really love I haven't actually worn yet
but I completely forgot that I got it is
this super casual shirt like dress with
the tie at the front they usually been
really into and I think beige looks
really nice at the tan or even with
really pale skin or dark skin I think
beige is just such a really nice
versatile color
yeah I really love the color of it and I
just think this is really cool to chuck
on when you're going for dinner with the
fam or when you have like a meeting this
I feel like this with you know my Gucci
mules would look really cool because you
can really dress it up and make it look
quite appropriate or you can dress it
down and it can be super casual and easy
like a Sunday breakfast in the morning
when you're extremely hungover and you
just want to check something on the
first bikini that I got was this white
one which I thought was so cute so I
thought this bikini was super cute I am
a fiend for white bikinis I think same
white in bikinis when you've got a bit
of a tan in summer in sexy as I really
loved this because if you can see the
fabric up close like it's like that like
it that scrunchie almost hyped that
break I like the top it's a cool shape I
like the rose gold accents to it thought
this was super beautiful on the model
I'm white fox beauty I was like I want
it on me
next I got quite a few
of this the bikinis in this gorgeous
dusty pink shade dusty pink is one of my
favorites at the moment I really want to
get a bag that is this color
I got a few bikinis in this shade
they've done so well with their bikini
line I'm really obsessed a woman
genuinely everything on the site then I
got this awesome car this is the flora
orange pair that I posted quite a lot of
pictures in this was my favorite to wear
in bali cuz when you had me to tan you
just glowed
I just personally like when I'm tanning
wearing bewbs like this cuz you don't
get any tan lines or anything so this
was like my perfect perfect bikini that
I brought to Bali I was totally obsessed
with but this gorgeous black color as
well this is pretty much the same as the
orange but it's got this really cute
thin straps on the side which I think
it's really flattering I like to pull it
sort of above my hips and it just hugs
my figure really nicely I've been
wearing this black top like everywhere I
took it to pop me with me when I went on
the weekend and it's just really good to
tan with them it's really good to wear
under clothes actually I feel like I've
got a lot of tops that are really lower
hanging and I need a bra under it but I
don't want the bra straps so I was
actually wearing this almost like as a
strapless bra the whole weekend and then
another one of my favorites I know that
everything is pretty much my favorite
but it's this really cool cobalt sort of
I don't even know this one I found our
wore a lot in Mali as well just because
I think it was just the most flattering
on me and made my boobs like I don't
have biz but made my boobs look big like
I'll insert a picture here if you can
see it looks like I've got boobs it just
shapes me really nicely and shape to my
chest really nicely then next I got this
gorgeous sarong if you guys have
followed me for ages you know that I'm
some fiend as well songs are just
something that I just die or it's not my
because if you just walking around the
beach and for me I just get
self-conscious having wedgies like but
I'll show I chucked my sarong on and I
just feel a hundred times better and I
think songs are beautiful I feel very
sexy miss wrong I think it just shapes
your body really nicely and leaves a
little bit up to the imagination so I
got this gorgeous what's wrong with
these colorful tassels which I really
liked and then I got this this is I
think my favorite thing from the whole
whole like if I'm going to say one thing
is my favorite because I know I've got a
lot of favorites this would be the
number one thing but this is just
probably something that I will wear the
most out of anything I just would I just
love it I think it's so beautiful it's
so angelic every way you walk it flows
in the wind covers me up nicely so I
feel protected but not too much where
you can't see you're in a bikini and
you're sitting by the pool and it just
it's so angelic and classy I told you
guys this is a long ball lots of stuff
so moving on to shoes now I got three
pairs of shoes from white box boutique I
got these cool sandals this was cool
with really really thin straps to it
it's so simple for a girl like me that
it's very tall the last thing you want
in a pair of sandals is a heel so this
is pretty much as thin as it got and I
was like that is perfect for me because
they're dressy enough that you can wear
with a dress and go to drinks with if
you don't my heels because I loved them
so much I got the heel version of them I
just thought that they were really
delicate and they would look so
beautiful than the foot my favorite type
of heel is something that has a really
thin thick straps and quite cool in
certain circumstances but I feel on me
what I suit the most is really delicate
heel so I just thought this was um a
perfect little pair of black heels and
because I just wanted to try something
different I wouldn't usually have gone
for this but I picked up this little
dusty pink pair of shoes I'm cute in the
picture and you guys know I like this
color so this color is just kind of what
drew me to it it's just like a little
bit different I've just got to stop
wearing my back and socks on my slides
very nice and neutral quite plain and
simple but still very sophisticated so
yes that is the end of the haul I hope
that you guys have enjoyed it thank you
so much to white folks we take this
evening means clothes and partnering up
with me in this video I hope that you
guys found some things that you might
like and you have a shop on their
website okay I'm gonna go pack my bags
for France now
to jet off on a plane I'll see you guys
