channel I just jumped out of the shower
and I'm getting ready for an event I
thought I would show my video you got
but I would film a video for you guys
but to make it more interesting I
thought I would do a full face of first
impressions because I haven't used a
bunch of makeup in a while since I went
away and also sports girl have sent me
these new items the glow items which I
need to try on camera as well the
ingredients sounds freaking phenomenal
it's the glow illuminating mask and it's
got manuka honey sweet almond oil kakadu
plum and evening primrose and grapeseed
oils so i'm going to start off with that
I have used this this particular mask
before but I haven't used the primer so
that'll be a first impressions but this
you just leave on your skin for like ten
minutes and it leaves its own Irish I
love to do these nourishing masks before
I do my makeup I don't always do it but
I don't like to do anything that's like
clearing on the skin or for pimples or
drying or anything like that
I just do these really moisturizing ones
and that way oh my god your foundation
sits on your skin so much nicer so if
you have the time I definitely recommend
this smells so good I feel like this
would also be like a really good one to
put on your skin like when you're on a
plane because it's just like really
nourishing it like stops the pollution
and go into your skin so I'm gonna leave
that on for about 10 minutes and I will
be okay um alright now that that's done
my skin feels beautiful by the way how
much of a wig out is it without me
having our last recession
alright let's hope this makeup works out
because I actually really need to look
good for this event why don't need to
look good but I would like to like to
look good so now onto the first
impressions this is the glow
illuminating serum primer from sports
girl and
it essentially is just like a serum and
it's got like little look lit up but no
it's not shimmer it's not lit up but
it's a little glowy particles in it
Gorge all right now that my skin is full
wrapped let's jump on to the foundation
so the foundation that I'm going to be
using today which isn't a first
impression I have used this it's this
new Naz natural radiant long wear
foundation and I tried this one and it's
just like not quite the right shade so
I'm going to try this little guy here
which is in suruc use I believe I wasn't
really the biggest fan of the foundation
but I don't know whether it's just like
cuz I didn't set it properly I feel like
it's separated a little bit on my skin
but I'm gonna try again today and we'll
see how it goes little puddle well I
always do this I come in without a
mirror and I'm like so make it so
complicated that's myself alright I'm
just going to use my fingers because I
don't have my B blend up I really need
every time whoa that's orange
okay how do you know it's like extremely
orange on me but I'm thinking that I can
Oh making a mess I'm thinking I can just
blend it out and then put some light
concealer over it that's definitely
different to the Saira q Syracuse shade
from the other foundations I'm pretty
sure because that one's like what I wear
when I'm light and right now I like how
they turn on so okay well I mean it
gives me a really beautiful finish I'm
just going to take a my foundation brush
and just kind of like make sure it's all
blended although I will say that blended
sorry beautifully with my fingers like
what the hell and I mean my skin does
look beautiful I'm just a bit distracted
by how Orange I look okay it's enough
for concealer I'm gonna try this Kat Von
D lock-it concealer and this is again
something that I tried it once before
but it was too dark for me at the time
it still kind of is quite dark would be
hard to tell on camera but like the tone
of it isn't like a nice brightening one
apparently there this concealer is like
amazing look at the girls at Sephora was
saying that it's like definitely a
favorite of peoples but I can see like
it's very full coverage I can see how it
would be loved yeah wow that was nice
and that blended super easy
okay and then measure out this clinic
invisible blend translucent powder oh
shit I just felt that everywhere and I'm
just gonna bake with this oh my god
woah that made my eyes smooth freaking
AB like photoshopped
so sorry I'm just gonna take like a big
fluffy brush and just kind of set the
rest of my face at bucks I do know that
this foundation is very jewy so I feel
like it's not gonna last me all night
how does just like transformed my skin
transform to my skin
you think red translucent powder maybe
I'll keep using it and I'll let you guys
know I'm gonna try out this mineral
bronzing powder by endo - spa
well everything is turning out frickin
great so far
I truly feel like my doing a Maus before
you do makeup really makes like the
world of difference because it just
makes like any foundation that you put
over the top of it just sit so nicely
like you basically just get rid of any
dry patches and then for highlighter I'm
gonna try this models own sculpting glow
highlighting powder in golden sand zero
one and it looks pink it looks pink and
I don't really like pink so we'll try
this out whoa that's crazy
well enough of a fan of the shade like I
wish they actually had like more of a
golden sound like an actual champagne
e-type color but it's still so beautiful
nonetheless and I'm pretty sure this is
like I cry too cheap affordable brand oh
I'm tired I still haven't really kicked
jet lag in the bottom because I've been
quite sick since I got back so I'm
sleeping all that well bring some of
that here yeah you know the joke jeez
god this highlighter this is crazy now
to make sure that all those powders
really sink into my skin I'm gonna take
this below illuminating mist by sports
girl as well and I use this before after
during mmm that's a really nice fine
mist you know what makes oh that made
the highlighter look so nice that really
wasn't that in well it's a good day of
first impressions everybody for the eyes
and so excited that I don't have eyelash
extensions because I can actually try to
do like something kind of cool with my
eyes so I'm gonna take those Marc Jacobs
the wild one palette untouched Oh
full of kind of interesting shades
different different shades I'm gonna
start off with this as a transition
shade though oh whoa whoa what very well
what the very pigmented wait what the
did I have something in my brush like
buffing brush and just buffing out I do
something like maybe like a champagne
rice call book I'm gonna pick up any
more product and was gonna go straight
into this I because whatever is on my
brush whether that be the shade
pigmented and I think it is the shade I
haven't used to something like this I'm
just picking up more of that I'm a
different brush I'm just gonna see what
that just maybe like daehan oh yeah
that's definitely the shade that is that
pigmented it wasn't I just picked up too
much clearly beautifully pigmented
though that's amazing okay now I'm gonna
pick up a little bit of this trade just
here I'm just so random I washed my hair
with the full intention to actually
style it and now I know I'm gonna run
out of time yeah just look it I always
leave everything so last-minute
now I don't really have time to do
anything extravagant so I'm gonna pick
up this shade here and I'm just gonna
run it all over my eyelid oh my god
wow that's the eyes connect champagne
golden rosiness I'm gonna try out this
glitter from Too Faced it's glitter pop
peel off eyeliner and I'm just gonna put
it like pull over just to do something
different wow that's actually really
cool though
so pretty oh my god I love how
accidentally awesomeness turned out hell
yes let me just try out the bad gal bang
mascara while I was away I salute
everybody and the sisters were raving
about this I'd have my eyelashes to test
this out with but how cute a guy whoa
I'm in love already okay it looks like
you can get a little clumpy but it also
is like crazy drama like crazy drama my
goodness
did you like two swipes and it's like
completely coated your lashes okay well
for someone that feels like she doesn't
have any lashes that left out her
extensions
I am mighty impressed now I'm just gonna
spritz my face one more time with my
glow illuminating missed by let's go
that's a really nice fine mist I like
that oh right and then to finish off the
a look I'm gonna go in with my new Marc
Jacobs
j'adore creme lipstick um
and I'm gonna try out the shade oh the
shade is your door
it's really thin but pigmented
uncomfortable just to give you guys
literally the easiest review of
everything that I just used I thought
everything was amazing like I'm not even
joking I thought everything was amazing
usually there's like one product in
there that I'm like you and to be honest
I thought that that was gonna be the
foundation I was like oh it's very
orange but it's actually turned out
really well so I hope that you guys have
enjoyed this video I love love filming
these videos I always have so let me
know if you guys like them as well
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
