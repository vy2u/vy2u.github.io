telling a lie night running free you got
a lot of as busy look in this town

Rizzoli who sit at home o-over one day

me with that okay so we are back at the
airport in Sydney I haven't vlogged at
all today because well I have logged a
lot but it's going to be for my princess
Holly and benefit video coming out next
week
she's so exciting I had so much fun
today thank you so much to the girls at
princess Holly and the girls at benefit
it was honestly so well organized and
such a good day I love them very much
okay now I'm just on a mission to find
my car again and we're going to go home
currently chemcam at night and it is at
home in my bed so I'm keen to go home
have a shower and snuggle up with him I
like I said I didn't really include much
footage in this vlog today so
so humiliating but we will start fresh
tomorrow the most work to do so I might
not block that tomorrow but it's going
to work right yeah so I'm going to find
my car now talking with you later
I know I feel like I show you guys my
user it's like on a daily basis but I
just got this package and how cute it
came with a rose bie i-news the head of
the resort like sitting by the window
till I literally am all over the place
so hi guys
where do I begin first of all it's been
a few days since I last updated you guys
eyes not upstairs you but the last time
I filmed for the vlog I sort of stopped
filming so I vlog then started filming
came to sit down videos and you guys we
sing very soon so like I'm all over the
place I'm very cancelled right now but
yes I want to sit down and do my makeup
and just update you guys and fill you
guys the amount a few things are
happening excuse how do I look I had um
some of my brunch in Iran and I haven't
taken it off so I look a bit gross and
dirty but so I'm going to prevent
foundation on I've been using it being a
maybelline dream cushion foundation
every single day I have a video coming
this foundation it was very soon I am a
jazz I was using this thing that came
with it but recently I have started
using a Beauty Blender as well but
doesn't work just as good but this gets
it done pretty quickly so it's down into
there and then um I think these are
sleeping so badly so you can probably
see the bad some of my eyes
I've just been sort of all over the
place you know when you have a million
things on your mind and you just don't
even you just can't stop thinking about
everything and then you just can't flee
the minute or so you get stuck in a
terrible cycle so that's me right now
I'm just using my check take concealer
to conceal the bags under my eyes to not
like my hair right now so yeah I
basically just wanted to sit down
and so there's update you guys on what
could be happening over the next month
if you follow me on my social media I've
been doing post the Topshop so I am top
shop somewhere ambassador for sports
girl I'm doing my thoughts girl series
for benefit and princess Polly if you've
been following me for a year you would
know that last year I did a
collaborations of campaign release for
their interred primer so accept the
prize of mascara
last year with cardio and this year I've
done the launch of the gala for Nia's
blush so I went back to princess Polly
HQ and we did a whole bunch of videos
there for princess Polly to my channel
and full benefit mine is sort of a blog
slash tutorial I'll be using all benefit
products that the main sort of component
of it is the launch of the girls on your
blush which might I tell you it is
beautiful it is so stunning and you'll
see more about that tomorrow
see you on rising when you were Topshop
I have my Topshop video coming out this
week I put so much effort into the
editing so I really hope you guys like
it
because I'm not good at editing I really
am not good it took me so long but it's
worth it
Topshop is such a funky brand and I
wanted to sort of make sure that I was
being true to them I really like how it
turned out so I hope you guys do as well
today when I dress me the rodeo baking
powder in zero one I've been using this
and love it this is incredible and it's
so travel friendly look how tiny it is
also I love it
definitely to be bringing this is me to
the festival but having told you guys
that either see so many things on my
lives I need to dislike federal using my
Bobbi Brown shared finish pressed powder
in soft honey to set the rest of my face
so then following Topshop we have
Maybelline coming out and a few blogs
back you guys saw that I went to a
Maybelline event and we learn about sort
of all the new launches for Maybelline
well my video is coming out now so I
feel that a while back and you guys
might have seen the look that I did but
in posting it in conjunction with sort
of the launch of the product so what
else else so that's coming out this week
as well I'm going to use my cooler
bronzer by benefit I felt a fullness
back in love with it I used my cool
bronzer alters Europe but then days
didn't have a bronzer and she was
traveling for another three months so I
just gave her my hauler and I haven't
had it so I finally got it back the
other day when I did it was benefit and
I love it so the reason I'm telling you
this now because I wanted to sort of
preface everything because I'm going to
be away this weekend I actually going to
be at a festival which is called Secret
Garden which is sort of to dress up
festival and we don't know where it's
going to be like it they announced where
it is sort of closer to the date which
is so exciting but I think it's like an
hour out of Sydney so I'm leaving on
Friday to go to Secret Garden
Oh what is on my collar is that sort of
been trying to organize a lot of stuff
for that as well a lot of stuff but
obviously you know you need to have your
outfit because it's dresser so you need
to make sure you have your tents and all
your equipment and everything for the
three days because it's sort of three
days so then we can't get all of that
together and get an alpha sorted which
I'm so behind on I really don't know
what I'm really wearing but a lot of
work to do this sweet so while I sort of
organizing everything for that I've been
filming a sort of how-to
festival guy so it's not a festival
guide that sort of prepare with me for a
festival so what I pack and things like
that
yes I'll be gone this weekend I'm so
excited so I love festival so it should
be really fun I'm any new
my California Bosch I have something
really special coming out with Mecca
Maxima you might remember that I went to
LA last year with my maxima with Bella
Tina and the mecca girls and we met so
many incredible brands are something
exciting that we've been working on it
is coming out on the Monday don't really
know all the details as of now but just
keep a look out over the weekend and on
on Monday because everything will be
launching then I'm so excited so a long
time coming so I'm so excited you guys
to see it and so also in regards to that
a really exciting announcement as well
is that I've been upset on my Instagram
I haven't told you guys is that I'm
having a meet-up in Sydney so this will
be my first ever made up which I'm sure
in there before I can't imagine anyone
actually coming like it I'm sort of my
biggest fear is that we haven't be happy
no one comes
luckily I we're having a with Bella and
Tina as well so I'm sure there'll be
heaps and heaps and heaps of people that
would want to want to meet them and I
should just give Rovers their cuddles
anyway and the 4th of March which will
be a Saturday and it's at 12 p.m. in
Bondi Westfield at the mecca Maximus jaw
so we're doing it through mr. Maxima and
yes it'll be as the mega Maximus tour in
Bondi I really hope I get to meet a lot
of you that would be such an incredible
experience being able to meet you guys
like I get to meet you guys always I got
basically pretty much on a daily basis I
meet like quite a lot of you and it's
really ever like one person or a little
group at a time so going to meet like a
lot of you together would be such an
incredible experience and I'm very very
nervous blushed very excited for it very
nervous but this is Geoffrey star in
celebrity skin I get my knife princess
Polly juice vamonos the planet in
freestyle my current favorite nude
lipstick at the moment
I'm just doing a really really easy
makeup look I just hope get really some
going out to the shops and I thought oh
we just get ready and have a chat with
you guys so it's a little bit more
interesting than me just sitting here
and blabbing it all this information at
you because even I'm getting really
confused right now with whatever even
told you we did a lot with a mega
Maximus so all that should be coming out
within the next few weeks as well so
we've got principally benefit Maybelline
Topshop Mecca health my sports girl
series I'll have what girl series
episode 2 coming out in the next few
weeks as well yeah I just like
absolutely love every single brand that
I think collaborating with like I like I
said to you guys for a dream come true
when all these brands won't work with me
I believe every time someone emails me
wanting to ask me it's just like really
it's just not something you get used to
be honest because it's brands that I've
always shopped at always loved when they
come to you and say I want to work with
you I want to make a video of you you're
like damn what did I do to deserve this
I'll have also as big regardin blog next
week I'm going to vlog at Secret Garden
prepare for a festival with me and I'll
have my actual vegetable vlogs I'll try
and make a bit a little bit of a
compilation of Secret Garden so that you
guys can see my outfit and everything so
know what I'm wearing so this love

right now but look at it this will be a
very big month and there'll be lots of
content I hope you guys are excited I'm
so excited what else what else well yeah

going to check the list I'll be right

you guys know what's coming up so that
you guys well in the loop I know I've
been but if I had a week off for videos
