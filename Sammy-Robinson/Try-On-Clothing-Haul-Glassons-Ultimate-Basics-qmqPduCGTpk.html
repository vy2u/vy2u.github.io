so today's video is a clothing haul I'm
really excited about this one because
I'm doing Eccleston which is one of my
all-time favorite shots I have shot two
glasses with years and years and years
basically my go to shops when I want to
find basic and really simple because
that I know will go with absolutely
everything so I was looking about tops
shorts jeans even dresses that are super
affordable but just go with everything
you know what I mean so I'm very happy
to be working with them today because I
love them and have loved them for ages
and ages yes without rambling on too
much let's just jump straight into the
hole so desire side and I'm going to
start with because it's right on top is
this beautiful way prett wide brimmed
hat I struggle with my big hair to fit
into hat and I thought the fellas going
to be the case on my own at this one but
this actually fit I mean it's such a
cute hat I've always wanted one like
this is a beautiful summery straw hat
that goes is so so many different
outfits you know little white speakers
and a little summer dress I've always
loved these hats and none of them have
ever fit my head so I just thought this
was super super cute and I want to spit
it out so next I will say the skirt and
shorts that I ordered were a bit too big
to me I ordered size 12 and they all
were quite quite beyond me so if you
order a 12 and it usually is kind of
snug on you like it is for me you know
it's hard to tell when online shopping
but Glassons has sort of bigger size 12
size 8 so the next day I picked up with
this gorgeous peachy colored skirt as
lobsters because it was quite an
interesting color this color is so
beautifully was with a can and then a
little white singlet and again white
sneakers or some sandals just a basic so
I would have find that this haul is
truly hard to explain things because
everything I got is basically basic just
completely basic so it's really hard to
explain so it's just a quick little haul
showing you guys what I picked up by
them well I just love to the color of
this and I love the fit I don't like
denim skirts that go to tub too smug and
too tight this one flares out a little
bit so it's really nice and flattering
next I picked up a few shorts this is
probably my favorite thing from glasses
I ever
get other shorts my favorite are the
cheeky denim shorts in I have black and
blue and I wear them almost every single
day of my life most comfortable short
and they just fit me so so well so these
I thought I did speedruns up cuz they're
quite similar to the ones that I
absolutely love these are quite cool
though because of the phrase on the
bottom a significantly bigger so it's a
little bit more more edgy Espo's but a
little bit longer but what I did as
you'll see in the footage is I rolled
them up to make them a bit shorter and
then you can roll them down however you
please I just thought I fixed a thumbs
up because I loved the color of this
denim I love a what I've not found of a
dark wash and not sound of a light wash
I such that I love with medium on which
is really vibrant and this goes so well
with tan skin and a white single in some
white sneakers and next I picked up
these short of you guys completely like
they're just quite huge so I definitely
order down the size if I were you if
you're going to pick up in either short
I don't know if it's just on me but I
think yeah they were all a bit too big
on me but I kind of like how these ones
turned out quite big if you're not
library touch of a tall anybody I know
we're not visit the stay light and fat
on my thighs slings to it and
inside so I love bank shots and so I
kind of like how these ones turned out
almost really being is that you can wrap
a belt around the waist and sort of grip
it in around the waist but then have you
know that there's really loose and
comfortable around the thighs so if I
got this cute little tank I love the
color of this car key the the reason I
love it my sister's love to like cocky
like it's a really dark archetype so
it's quite subtle but then I also just
loved this frame knots not fraying the
ribbing I don't know is is that the the
passes around this I just thought this
was a great little basic to have guys
drinking game every time I say basic
every time I say simple every time I say
cute take a shot you're all going to be
dead then I picked up this little stripy
one I thought this was just super cute
always love stripes in summer imagined
these at the white shorts that I wore
and I just loved the cute little tie at
the front and the thin straps I love
thin straps I think it's very
sophisticated and very flattering to
wear things shop super comfortable again
and will go with so many different
things I know I'm just going to be a
broken record I picked up this cute
little off the shoulder white top I left
you the wear this for this video over
then actually forgot they'd like to
change nails but I love this because it
reminds me of the fabric I used to wear
when I was younger
I'll show you up close did you guys ever
used to wear tops and things like this
when you were younger with this crap
again I love the vibrancy of the way in
this top and I love off-the-shoulder
things and office often
off-the-shoulder things are long-sleeved
so I like that this is a t-shirt it's
just really comfortable and quite cool
in summer so and again you know that
this is going to go with everything but
it's a cool way of having a basic top
and being able to sort of make it a
little bit different you know and then
next is this little white singlet this
is very self-explanatory why I would
have got this I don't know if
have to do any explaining adduce but you
guys get the drill this white singlet is
very flattering as all ages
singlets I just think a really nice and
you just pair it with a pair of down
short some white shoes the straw hat and
you've got your outfit set so yeah just
this suppers is really light and really
quite comfortable as well and um yeah as
yes I love off-the-shoulder thing so I
had to pick up these next two things but
um I love this color makes you look so
tanned I am wasn't really sure how to
wear it as you guys will see from the
clips I think I've tied it wrong because
I it had a massive gaping hole in the
middle and so if you'd leant forward
you'd be able to see your boobs and then
because of the whole you can't really
wear a bra but I think what you were
supposed to do was tie the bottoms a bit
tighter so that it didn't have so much
dating but I just love the color of this
I love how flowy it is next I've got
this a little gray singlet this one's a
title one so this one's more fitted on
me but this gray one is super super
comfortable really light fabric it
clings really nicely so it shows your
figure really well and it's sort of an
interesting color I always have light
gray I want to opt for a dark gray and
obviously you guys all know that it will
match everything but um I just tried to
differentiate the colors in all the
singles that I got so that it wasn't
just like the whole time so sort
of a variety of colors sticking in the
monochrome family so you know have
grades you know have different shades of
grey 50 shades of grey you know and then
I picked up this beautiful baby pink
off-the-shoulder one I just love this
for the flare sleeves I'm super into the
flash leaves at the moment
and it's really really lightweight
fabric which is gorgeous and some off
but then of the other reason I love this
is how it has the tire the bones that
can make it tight and you can show your
ways that you can make it a little bit
more midriff so it doesn't have to flare
out and not show any of your food oh um
so so yeah that way it shows a little
bit bigger and is also really light and
comfortable and flowy so I just love
baby pink at the moment I really really
want to have a 21st
that's all white and I turn up in baby
pink so they do think you might go
really well to this 21st is coming up so
soon I can't believe it sidenote is it
um alright so yes I hope I'm not missing
anything
I have just sort of types of clothes
tossed everywhere excited to try on
yesterday for this video but I love
absolutely everything I picked up and I
hope you guys do it as well there's a
little different style Hall which I'm
going to be trying to incorporate on my
channel a lot more so I try and do maybe
a sportswear haul next and you could
maybe do a dressy fall or the winter
haul let me let me know what you guys
want and I'll try and do that for you
and then obviously I'll do calls that
are just mixed mixes of everything just
things that I like things that catch my
eye
