lumpy and bumpy but I just want to get
this video film I'm so excited
I love holes let's do this
hi guys welcome back to my channel thank

video as you can probably tell by the
channel down below is a clothing haul I
thought it was the perfect time to do a
clothing haul before Christmas in case
you guys wanted to get any last-minute
buys princess Polly is probably I'd say
my favorite online store at the moment
so I am so happy to be collaborating
with them you guys know me you know that
I am obsessed with princess Polly so I
had to do a collab with them before the
end of the year to give you guys some
options for New Year's for some options
for Christmas some last-minute Christmas
shopping there's so many festivals for
New Year's and just in for summer in
general so I just thought it was the
perfect time to do an end-of-year haul
for you guys obsessed with every single
thing I got in this whole you guys are
going to love it I hope you guys gonna
love it if you like my style you'll
probably love it because I'm so happy to
have a discount code for you guys if you

so if you guys wanted to do that
last-minute Christmas shopping I would
definitely jump on the discount codes
yes and I'll leave all the links
obviously for everything that I've
purchased in the description box if you
guys want to buy any of them um and yeah
this is the first item that I did pick
up from princess Polly it is a swimsuit
I believe it's a one-piece swimsuit I'm
currently wearing no pad so I'm just
sitting here in a swimsuit I got really
hot when I film so I just like to wear
things that are really light and then
generally I just don't wear any pants to
be honest because you guys cuts here
yeah this is just a really cool it's
definitely some suit fabric um really
cool high-necked
black swimsuit I just know this whole
haul is going to be just filled with me
trying to figure out ways of explaining
things differently but I know I'm going
to be repeating myself so let's just say
it let's make a drinking game whenever I
say cool whenever I say funky whenever I
say I love it just let's make a drink
again you guys are gonna get drunk
there's a tie in the back so you can tie
it as tight as you want as loose as you
want and then it has the two panels I
suppose coming down either side of the
boot and then it's just a one-piece on
the bottom it is backless how do I need
to show you is I'm going to be inserting
Clips what is wrong with me I think it's
a really classy sort of bodysuit if
you're going to wear it as about a suit
to wear out because you could wet pair
it with a pair of black jeans and have a
really sexy outfit and um struggling to
explain things already secondly I have
this a little flowy black top I've had
my eye on this at princess Polly for a
while I did my last princess Polly whole
hey could I do I couldn't get it thanks
umm I believe it was sold out and I've
had my eye on it since then and that's
been like a few months but I think this
is the most beautiful top because it is
so so flattering feel really protected
still but it's just such a beautiful
flattering top and it's so delicate and
of course black goes with everything so
you can't go wrong with black you can
wear it so I'm so many different
occasions it's just perfect all around a
top so I really like this one
so next sticking with the theme of black
I picked up this beautiful sexy dress
this dress just epitomizes the word sexy
honestly it's got the thin spaghetti /
stretchy bands and then it's just ruched
nicely in the perfect way plus it gives
you that shape so it's not dead tight
but the black along with the ruching and
the little bit of looseness gives you
still gives you that beautiful shape but
it's just so flattering on your body
it's got those angles that gives you a
bit of that leg pop I can just imagine
wearing this with a pair of black heels
around the ankle you know there's really
delicate ones that wrap around the ankle
and just like slicking your hair back
and just like having your body on so
it's just like a really sexy sexy dress
so so now I'm going to show you these
shoes that I picked eyes are the most
beautiful delicate healed and this with
that little black dress that I showed
you before would be perfection so what I
love about these heels is that
has the really delicate strap around the
ankle which is really flattering on the
legs and then it's just also got the
same exact strap around the toes so it's
very symmetrical but it's just a really
simple piece that will go with any
outfit you pair it with this would go
with jeans and a top this would go with
a dress this would go for formal this
would go for casual it's so diverse this
shoe and it's beautiful because it's got
a nice wooden heel there next I picked
up these really cute little sandals
these straps go around the ankle so it's
a really flattering shoe again so
putting this with a nice summery flowy
dress or you know again a pair of jeans
I think this color is perfect it'll go
with everything and I especially love
this sort of color with my skin tone I
just love it because of such a simple
shoe but then it's also not too plain
like it does have a statement about it
it's the next I'll show you guys a few
belts that I picked up I got this brown
one with a big gold buckle and then I
also got a black one a sort of a smaller
gold back buckle so you guys can see the
comparison in the buckles here the brown
one is a lot bigger a lot of my black
belts I've realized actually have silver
buckles and I'm definitely a gold girl
like all my accessories and things are
gold so I thought I had to pick this up
so that it would match everything I had
to color coordinate so I've done the
option of gold belt oh and I love
princess Holly belts they have the most
beautiful buckles with such intricate
designs had such a statement to a simple
outfit and I love brown I could match
this with any brown shoe I have have a
lot of brown baiji colors through love
brown for some of us that goes really
well with denims while I'm on the topic
of accessories I picked up this cool hat
I'm such a cat fan I love in summer
being able to put a cap on with a pair
of glasses and just go to the beach this
one is amazing because um it isn't too
low down so a lot of caps come quite far
down and they cut me off right here so
as the cut as the cup cuts me off my
ears realistic out this caps stops a
little bit higher so it doesn't pull so
tight on my ears and make them stick out
it just you know it gets the room
my poor little sticky-outy is absolute
such a cool color this would go so well
with just a plain t-shirt and some denim
shorts and some white shoes I just
thrills upside down with a palm tree so
it's cool always being obsessed with
regular so I saw that princess probably
had quite a lot of Wrangler on their
site so I had to pick up one of their
shirts I love the right around the
collar
and then the red around the sleeve I
love the symmetry of it and then
obviously on the writing I just find red
goes really well with denim shorts I
think it's such a nice like nap nice
color combo um so I'm imagining this
t-shirt with a pair of denim shorts my
little white sneakers and you know my
son is like my little round sunny so
this is probably one of my favorite
things I've picked up I've already worn
this so many times since I got it and I
got this like two days ago this is the
offends sort of muscle tee with this
lining around the color it's quite
high-necked I love muscle tee tops I
don't know why with again denim shorts
and like white sneakers I'm really into
them at the moment I have so many new
ones love the stripe around the neck I
don't know why so much baseball vibes I
think actually I don't even know I don't
even watch baseball it's full length
it's just really really soft fabric
really light fabric and I just thought
was perfect for someone at the top that
I picked up is this little white
wraparound top um
god I'm nursing I'm like a broken record
when I say I just thought that this was
perfect for summer again so I picked
this one up just because it's super
lightweight so cute got the tie and
what's great about it is that it's
really really lightweight so a really
hot day if you just wrap this around you
your bikini underneath it's just going
to be so comfortable this would be so
massive like a nice big wine wide
brimmed hat too more tops that I have to
show you guys is this this white one
which is so cool it's for probably my
second favorite one
I'm slipping into off the shoulder I
think it's so nice in summer but this
one is awesome because it has the huge
puffy sleeves to it there isn't this one
so cool is because it's ruffled so it's
almost got like that cha-cha vibe to it
and then char-char tops are quite
the women I think so I love the stark
white I think it's so nice and someone
because it makes you look really tanned
and this has to be my favorite thing
that I picked up this is the checkered
cha-cha top my friend Georgie has a top
like this before the original from the
designer but this has this came out on
princess Polly and I was like oh my god
Georgie looked so so incredible in it so
I had to pick it up and it's just such a
beautiful flattering top that is so
different like it's not it's quite an
unusual it's quite an unusual top it's
just obsessed I fell in love so I had to
pick this up and I just don't I don't
even know how to explain it obviously it
has the ruffled sleeves you can weight
up on the shoulders or you can write
down like I wear it um
and it's got the ties that's just super
flattering around the waist and it's
just like literally the perfect top and
then in the same fabric I got this
esmeralda dress this is the reason this
took my fancy is because I love
Esmerelda from Hunchback of Notre Dame
and I thought it was going to be that
type of thing like a gypsy type dress
why this is great for summer is because
the fabric is so lightweight like it's
really really really quite thin um and
it's just it's just a really different
dress I have never really bought
anything check it before and then it's
got the low neck v um so yeah it's like
a nice long summery dress and it's just
yeah it would be perfect with some white
sneakers next I picked up this gorgeous
play suit I just love it I just think
it's the nicest little jumpsuit to wear
for sort of a formal occasion but then
it's also quite casual it's really
modest and really sweet like it's a
really sweet little jumpsuit it's got
the t-shirt so it covers your arms and
then it ties down here so it's got the
little bow and it's just really flirty
and pretty and flowy and then next I
picked up some swimsuits I loved these
colors this baby pink is really in at
the moment and then also brown I'm
obsessive round this one unfortunately
is a bit too big for my boobs yeah I
just really loved the color of this one
the reason I was cute as well was
because it has it has this obviously the
strap around the waist but then it has
another strap so you can sort of make it
look a little bit old-fashioned by
bringing it up above the waist of its I
cupped swimsuit which I love I love that
look this one is again a little bit too
big for me unfortunately I am whenever I
buy a size 12 foot to fit my bum the top
never fits makes I don't have any boobs
and then the pads are so nice as well
because it's got the fixed straps it's
almost like a little bit disconnected
like it has the gap in between them like
the Front's of completely disconnected
from the backs loves the swimsuits as
well so that is everything that I picked
up from Princess probably I hope I
haven't left because I've been wearing a
few of the bits and pieces I hope I
haven't left anything out I will leave
all the links in everything in the
description box as well as the discount
