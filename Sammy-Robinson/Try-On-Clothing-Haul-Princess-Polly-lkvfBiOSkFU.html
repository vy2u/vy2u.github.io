today's video is another clothing haul
this one I'm so excited for because I
absolutely love everything that I got
though it is in collaboration with
princess Polly I have been the biggest
fan of princess Polly for the longest
time they have such a diverse range and
the best quality clothes and I've I've
shopped there for years I honestly love
them so very excited to be doing this
video with them today
so I have a discount code for you guys
which gets you 20% up 20% off I believe
and I'll leave that on the screen and in
the description bar below so make sure
to check that out if you guys do want to
go do some shopping on princess Polly so
first I'll start off with this little
car key Green vomit colored set describe
that as vomit in a bad way but honestly
I am obsessed with the color of that
it's so comfortable but it's the coolest
little lounge around pajama II sort of
feel but at the same time it's so cool
the fabric is ribbed and very stretchy
so it's so comfy I don't know just like
they come in tied the ways I've got the
tie they've got the fold which are
really flattering I think you could just
chuck on some white shoes look your hair
back put a cool pair of sunnies on and
wear anywhere
next I picked up these denim shorts I
got these a little bit too big for me I
should probably should have got the size
down but they're really really
comfortable they're high-waisted um
they're not too short because again I am
almost 6 foot so I do find I have quite
an issue with shorts being too short on
me everything nice and baggy so it's
really flattering I wear it with little
midriffs and I just think it's the
cutest outfit coming up to summer now so
so it's going to work with so many
different outfits next we got this
adorable little white play suit this is
the cutest thing I have ever seen I was
very skeptical of this place it because
I thought it wasn't going to fit me
often place it a way too small they just
don't fit my torso and they literally
show my whole entire butt but this one
is it's verging on a little bit too
short for me but I just think it's so
frigging cute of the little floral
details and then also this is that CRO
crochet and it'll be perfect for the
beach in time with me so I know I'll be
getting
that's abuse of that one this jumpsuit I
am obsessed with I'm going to be wearing
this so often I will this the other day
to an event and I put a little white
t-shirt underneath it and it just
created the cutest little again sort of
kid like play suit outfit I love the
fabric it's so light
so it's going to be so nice for summer
because it's honestly got nothing to it
it's just really really light
comfortable fabric so I did pick up
quite a few places in this video so this
one's a little bit more dressy again you
can wear it casually
but I could wear it you know out to an
event so it's basically a strapless
jumpsuit but it does have the ties
around the side that makes it more of an
off-the-shoulder attire so you can style
it however you like and it just looks
really smart really casual um and really
flattering and here's another jumpsuit
um so this one I actually have already
bought before I bought it in white
probably six months ago I actually
probably 7 months ago I remember exactly
when I wore it's my first started dating
net and honestly it was just so
comfortable the easiest little place who
to throw on but you go to the beach you
just you just look sling it on and then
you're you're good to go you just Chuck
on a pair of thongs um in Australia its
thongs not quite knows everyone else
called them but is it when I most call
phones ah flip-flops sandals flip-flops
B I loved the white one so much that I
just wanted to pick this one up because
obviously you guys know me it was beige
and I couldn't pass it up because I
loved the color I almost actually liked
it better than the white okay so next we
have this little two-piece ensemble
guys I wish you could feel this like I
honestly want you to be here with me and
just be able to feel this it's so
comfortable it's like a pair of like
tracksuit light it's like a really light
fabric slash track suit feel to them
it's the coolest color it's just the
coolest fabric it's ribbed but it's
comfy
and stretchy more of a fancy outfit but
the fabric almost insinuates like a
beachy vibe I think it's going to be so
comfortable as like a going-out outfit
like honestly when do you find outfits
to go out in that are like wearing your
pajamas oh my god it's like a bundle of
joy next I picked up this off the
shoulder top
I love off-the-shoulder things there's
not much else I can say about it it's a
very fancy fabric though I would
definitely wear this on a going out
occasion it has its little flares on the
end of the sleeve which is really in at
the moment there's lots of flared
sleeves going around it's a really nice
sophisticated off the shoulder top to
have and it's four more over going out
occasion so another pair of shorts I got
with these little white ones I don't
have any white shorts I think white in
summer is amazing especially if you pair
it with something that's really vibrant
and has a really vibrant color to it
it's a cool they're a little bit risque
because they have all the rips but they
go long the back so it covers everything
doesn't show you bum I just think white
looks incredible on tan and as we are
going to summer we're all going to be
getting a bit more turnt well not all of
us us us Aziz so I thought this was
definitely essential with summer coming
up and finally up no it's not finally
the last item what I am wearing also is
something that I picked off up from
princess Polly this one is really
comfortable because it is a crop top but
usually the crop tops I own are really
tight
this one's just really really actually
really quite loose but it's almost
flattering because you can see your
waist underneath it so I really love the
lining of it that's a nice wide width at
the top and quite high net instead of it
being just a plain crop top it does have
a very dressy vibe to it so I do quite
like this um for maybe a bit more about
going out occasion pairing it with a
nice pair of pants or a skirt or think
it's something like that hair back I
never wear my hair out are you guys do
you guys like it
do you like my neck hair hey shut up Sam
now the last item of clothing I got was
this little white one this is one of my
favorites I think because it's so
flattering I feel like everything I
explained is just flattering ever
so flattering but often you know you buy
things that you know are going to be
flattering on you so you know that it
fits really nicely so the spaghetti sort
of straps they're not quite scary but
they're really thin and delicate on your
shoulders so you see all your chest area
but then it goes into a nice little
flurry sleeve so oh it's gone to the
dark color oh so it goes into a really
nice flavor sleeve so it's just really
delicate on your arms and on your
shoulders and has a lovely tie to it and
the fabric is silk so it's so beautiful
it's so soft
you
so next I've picked up a few things from
the accessory section / the makeup
section picked up these glasses these
are really cool again I don't know if
they suit me but I mean they're pretty
funky I mean I don't look into the ring
light so you go see but you know they've
got the barb over the barb what's a cord
the bar over the top which is really in
at the moment a lot of glasses have the
bar over the top and then it's more of a
small slide glasses gold rimming and
then I think it's like a greenish
goldish reflect really delicate and
really are quite funky I think I really
liked osek funky edgy flattering
delicate but um I don't really know how
to explain things I need to like get a
dictionary I expand my vocabulary yeah
pretty much I just think these are a
really cool pair of sunnies I then
picked up two chokers one is thicker so
it's a thick banded choker this is a
clip up one and it's leather I think
it's obviously faux leather a little bit
more edgy I'd say and this one's a
little bit more delicate it has a suede
band with lots of little stars dropping
up but not even in focus
suede band with lots of little stars
dropping off the side so I probably
preferred the more delicate style of
choker I just think it's really cool I
liked this one I already taking it out
so anyway next I bought a jeffree star
liquid lipstick in and drogyny I've
never bought anything from Jeffrey's
style before so I definitely wanted to
pick something up and I find it really
cool the makeup that princess Polly
stocks online they have jeffree star
backup which is awesome which is like
amazing that they got such high quality
makeup I try like a little bit on over
what I've got it's like it seems like it
would be a bit of a similar color yeah
so it's like a little bit ready err
so it's like a dark purple e plumbing
you ready with liquid lipstick um I like
that one so I also picked up the LA girl
Pro concealer in the shade beautiful
bronze I've already used this for about
three days now and I am obsessed with it
this is the best cream contour I have
ever used I am like honestly obsessed
with it you already see like how much
I've gone through you can kind of see
the tubes like been squished and then
finally I picked up a Becca foundation
it's the aqua luminous perfecting
foundation I got it in the shade beige
which I know is going to need to life
for me um which is good yeah that's
definitely IB why did you like me but
nonetheless I might return that and get
the darker shade because I know that
there's quite a lot of shades to this
range so I will either try this one or
I'll return it and try it and keep you
guys updated on that so I hope you guys
have enjoyed this haul I definitely had
so much fun with this one because I
loved everything I picked up so much so

that is needed below in the description
