so today's video is very exciting
because it's another clothing haul I
know you guys like these clothing halls
so I'm incorporating a lot more in my
channel
so today's video is in collaboration
with show boom so I chose a whole bunch
of things off their website and I'm
going to be trying them on for you guys
today
Australia is slowly getting warmer and
warmer as we are approaching summer so
I've chosen quite a few little summer
pieces um and you guys know me I've
stuck to quite simple basic pieces
that's what I like to wear
so I also do have discount code for you
guys I'll leave it and in the
description box if you guys are
interested um and yeah let's just jump
straight into the video so Binion I'll
start off with this little gray t-shirt
this is just your perfect little simple
basic top I'm going to tell you how many
little midriff sort of crop style top
side oh I'm completely addicted to
playing them I just find that they match
a lot of different outfits really well
so this is a really lovely fabric its
ribbed and almost a little bit marbled
so it's not completely grey and the
buttons down the front are really cool
because you can obviously show a little
bit of cleavage or you can button it all
the way up it's just a great basic to
have in your closet next we have these
little blue short jeans jean shorts
however you call them theirs
fit really nicely they're quite a
stretchy fabric so they're quite
comfortable they don't cling too much
kind of like your mum's style short
jeans so it's been cut off so you can
wear it a little bit longer I like to
fold it at the ends to give it that
little frayed folded look I love having
a pair of damsels in my wardrobe so you
can pair with a lot of different things
but yeah they're really comfortable I
really like these next we have this
camel slashed hand color turtleneck
long-sleeve this fabric is so soft the
really lovely light stretchy fabric but
when you do put it on it clings nicely
to your figure I love long sleeves and I
love turtlenecks I think they are really
cool it's not too much of a turtleneck
so that it's big and bunches up on your
neck so I find that quite annoying it
just has a little you know it just comes
up really nice and I find it very
stylish
I love tan and camel I've had this a
pair of denim shorts or maybe a skirt
and a denim jacket
I think tan just looks really great with
a medium washed denim the most important
part about this top for me is that it's
really comfortable next we have this
corduroy nude baiji skirt I think the
skirt is perfect I love having a little
miniskirt in my collection I'm obsessed
with corduroy having different different
fabrics is a great way of spicing up
your outfit I love this color as well
you guys tell me a black white beige 10
beause my colors the only thing for me
is that it was a bit big around the West
um I'm usually a size 12 on in bottoms
but this is definitely sort of more of a
size 14 for me so this is quite a big
fit so if you're going to go for that
maybe order the size down and what you
usually would just put a belt around the
waist and it looked alright so next we
have these jeans with the rips and the
legs and the phrase at the ankles I've
been really into ripped jeans at the
moment I'm actually it makes your outfit
look really edgy I actually only really
wear medium wash denim and I tried these
on and I really loved it actually makes
you look quite tired as well and if you
have blue eyes or King Cobra
well and it's quite it's quite
flattering having dark denim as darker
clothes can be quite swimming so yeah
next we had this cute little jumpsuit I
saw this online I thought it was really
cute
um it's not something that I would I
would generally wear every day but I
thought it was just a really sweet
little jumpsuit to have I love the Hynek
chuckle look and it's quite flattering
how it comes down really thin over your
boobs so it shows still a little bit of
your décolletage and it makes your
shoulders look really nice
the back is really cool as well it's
insert at the top obviously so it shows
a little bit of back next we have this
white squat I love this as you have the
comfort of shorts and with the look of a
skirt it's really flattering it covers
everything and I just think they look
really funky they have the tasseled fray
look around this edges of the skirt I
just think really different I didn't
have anything like that so I thought
they were really cool next we had these
little black shorts good thing about
these as well as that they're stretchy I
was a bit daunted when I saw these
online because I do have thicker legs
and I don't like wearing tight denim
tight hard denim because I just it's
just really unflattering on me um so I
saw these now so I'll just give it a
shot they do hug your finger so they are
tight shorts um I am definitely more
into the baggy style of shorts but I
just know that they'll go with quite a
lot of things and they'll be great for
some us next I got two off the shoulder
tops I got the black ribbed top and the
beige one the beige sort of kind of
beige kind of sand
I love off-the-shoulder things and
especially love off-the-shoulder
long-sleeve things and especially love
off-the-shoulder long-sleeved type
things they are the perfect length
they sit really nicely they're not
midriff so it's not uncomfortable it it
covers your stomach so the fabric is
ribbed and it's just really lightweight
so it's not you think either it's not
going to be too hot
um and yeah I just don't really get
heaps of wear out of these so as I got
this little silk wraparound dress this
is beautiful a beautiful pinky champagne
color I love look of these dresses when
people wear the silk dress or the white
t-shirt underneath
and maybe like a denim jacket over the
top I think it's the cutest outfit so I
love that it's a wraparound dress as
well a lot of them were just plain slips
that I found online but this one is
great because you can wrap it around and
make it tight to come in at your waist
or you can do it up loose as well so you
get the best of both worlds with this
dress I'm completely obsessed with these
spaghetti straps I think they are really
really flattering and very dainty so I
picked up this two-piece tan set what
you mean this was the color of it I love
my tan clothing and have anything like
that in my closet either um I feel like
this whole is just me feeling my closure
with things that I don't have of which I
have so many clothes so that's just it's
quite a light fabric and it's really
comfortable so you can wear it out to a
special occasion and dress it up or you
could actually just wear it casually
with a pair of little white sneakers and
a wide-brimmed hat sort of to the beach
like a beach outfit yeah so I just love
to the versatility and this to be so
next I picked up a few exercise pieces
I've been trying to in the morning when
I wake up put exercise clothes straight
on so that it forces me to think that
I'm going to go for a walk or to think
I'll go to the gym often it doesn't
happen because
the laziest person alive but you know if
you're wearing exercise gear you sort of
feel a little bit more active and maybe
you'll do a bit more walking I love the
look of wearing high-waisted gym shorts
with a little cute crop this gray set
was to die for I love the stripes I
think it's so flattering and just such a
cool outfit I would like I feel like I
want to wear this out but I just don't
know if that's socially acceptable
anyway the bras really nicely fitted
it's a cross back with a little bit of
netting on the back and then it does
have some cups in the front so you don't
have to wear a bra if you're like me and
you don't have that big boobs it's good
enough support yeah I just loved the
color I love light gray and I loved the
stripes I just think it's really funky
little gym outfit I then picked up this
little gym top as well it's from the gym
section but I would wear this casually
it's a really light weight white singlet
it's cross back as well it does have the
low scoop arm holes so it's going to
show whatever bro you're wearing
underneath so I would wear this casually
with a really nice bra under it I just
love how lightweight it is I just think
it's going to be really comfortable and
quite handy so and then finally for the
gym outfits I picked up the black set I
don't have it here because it's in the
wash I've learned that heaps as well
it's really really comfortable I love
the pants I love that they're
high-waisted just feels like it's
something everything in for you the tops
really great as well because you can
wear that under a whole heap of gym tops
or any other
it's it's got a really cool back I wear
it on its own with with the pads because
the pads are so high-waisted that only
shows like a little bit of skin at the
top yeah thought I'd pick up some gym
clothes and get into the gym and then
finally I picked up two pairs of
sunglasses these ones are really cool
but they don't really suit me
unfortunately but nonetheless they are
really nice rose-gold pair of sunglasses
with an interesting shape lens and it's
really delicate I do love deliver
glasses and then I love my aviators dog
glasses these ones are really cool
they're really wide set so if you have a
wide face these ones would fit you
perfectly it's black and gold so those
colors are very cool
so that is the end of my whole I hope
