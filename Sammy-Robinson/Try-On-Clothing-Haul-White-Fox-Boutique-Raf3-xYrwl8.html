today's video is another clothing haul
I've teamed up with whitefox boutique to
bring you guys this video whitefox
boutique is one of my favorite online
stores it has been for years I've
actually already done a video with them
once for my channel so I'll link that
down below if you guys would like to
check that out but otherwise yet today
is another haul with them um I have a
discount code for you guys as well which
is Sami I believe I'll leave it on the
screen and in the description box if you
guys are interested you guys have been
asking me heaps lately for more videos
including a bit more fashion and showing
a little bit more of my style so I'm
going to try and incorporate quite a few
more fashion hauls on my channel I have
a few planned if quite a few coming up
just so that I can incorporate a little
bit more style on my channel because I
know you guys like it um so yeah without
further ado let's just jump straight
into the whole I hope you guys enjoy if
you do make sure to give this video a
thumbs up for me because it helps me out
heaps let's jump into the video now I
feel it's very necessary for me to start
off with these two items these two
jumpers have been on all over my
Instagram especially this grey one so I
got the jumper in black and in grey the
best thing about these jumpers is that
they are so comfortable and really soft
and genuinely keep you warm like a
jumper should like that's the purpose of
a jumper but it's cool because it's off
the shoulder it makes your outfit look a
little bit stylish as opposed to dagi
where jumpers often quite die on me I
can't escape looking a little bit
underdressed whenever I'm wearing
jumpers so I love off-the-shoulder
things I think it's very flattering to
show a bit of your decolletage these
jumpers speak for themselves you guys
know I love them they're probably my
favourite item of clothing
at the moment they go with anything a
great thing about these jumpers as well
is that they go long at the backs it's a
really nice link at the front that it
shows your jeans and your shorts but
then it drapes all the way down the your
backside at the back so if you're like
me and you don't like showing the back
of your legs if you're wearing shorts
these jumper these drivers are really
flattering and they cover that for you
so absolutely love these jumpers they're
my favorite item at the moment
my next favorite from whitefox that I
picked DARPA is the are these jeans so
you're just just your classic waistline
jeans they fit really nicely they're not
too tight but they're not too loose they
are so comfortable something about the
ripped jeans just makes it look edgy to
me which I love the color of these jeans
are perfect I'm not so into a really
light wash Jean but I don't really like
a dark one so this is a perfect
in-between it makes you look really
tanned if you have a tan because it's
quite a vibrant blue they are stretchy
ish but they're not too stretchy that
they get really loose and they're bad
quality and I've been wearing these
jeans almost every single day with
different tops different shoes I dress
it down with white shoes and a t-shirt I
can dress it up with a pair of boots or
high heels and yeah these jeans are just
very versatile and I am obsessed with
them at the moment next we have this
little black dress this is just a really
nice classy dress it's beautiful light
fabric which will be perfect when summer
comes around Australia's are starting to
get quite hot as it is spring and it's
just been really beautiful weather
lately so this is just your typical
Sunday slapped around dress that classy
it goes to a really classy length it is
paired beautifully with a nice white
pair of shoes and maybe a nice wide
brimmed hat the fabric is really light
so it's not hot it's nice and flowy it
comes in tight at the waist which is
very flattering so it shows off your
thick it's just a really lovely modest
dress that is appropriate for lots of
occasions next we have this little silk
gray / silver toned t-shirt dress I am
an absolute sucker for t-shirt dresses
they are the most comfortable clothing
in the world I have been really into the
colors at the moment I think it's a
really classy way to dress up your
outfit it makes you look really
sophisticated but also you can make it
look quite edgy depending on how you
accessorize this dress is so comfortable
I can tell I can tell them you to be
wearing this dress around the house and
non-stop it's just oh god I wish you
guys could like reach through the screen
and feel this because it's just the
softest fabric feels like a silk and the
sleeves are really flattering how they
have the folds on the end I just think
it's really nice comfortable casual
dress so next I got another pair of
jeans these are just a beautiful nice
comfortable pair of white jeans they
like the blue jeans in that they have
the hole at the knee but what
differentiates these jeans are actually
the ends which I found so cool they have
these little tasseled ends which it
doesn't flare out because I think flared
jeans are cool but I'm not necessarily
the biggest fan of flare jeans on me
these give you that kind of cool on the
building in the background my favorite
part about white jeans is they make you
look really tanned they're really fresh
it's annoying because they do get a
little bit dirty but they can pay they
can be paired with anything again I like
wearing white jeans with a nice stripy
top some white shoes white jeans are a
really funky addition to your wardrobe
and if you wanted to spice up your white
plain white jeans having something like
this on the ends with you know the knee
hole as well just bring something a
little bit different to the outfit next
I got these black pants I've been on the
hunt oh my god can you guys hear
drilling they have a sort of faux
leather type texture to them but they
again have sort of the graininess of
jeans I wouldn't really know how to
describe them I've been on the hunt for
some leather like pants black pants
playing pants um for a long time now so
I thought I would just get my hands on
these and they're really nice they're
just really plain next white fox was
kind enough to send me two dresses in
the same style in khaki and a sort of
salmon pink they also sent the black
version of that dress which I know I'm
gonna get so much use out of this
because little black shift dresses are
an absolute staple to have in your
closet so this dress that they've sent
is just a really nice high net beautiful
little short summary dress I know I'm
going to get lots of use out of these in
summer they're just really plain and the
the neckline is very flattering it
doesn't go too low doesn't go too high
that it's necessarily a choker like this
it's just really flattering on the
shoulders but yeah these would just be
really handy in summer when you just
want to chuck these over your bikini and
head it on down to the beach so then the
last clothing item I got from white Fox
boutique is this little set here I saw
this online and I thought this was just
the most beautiful little set for summer
it is so classy it looks so beautiful
when you're tanned it it's the most
stunning fabric it's really lightweight
it's the perfect summer essential it's
just a really classy cut and shape the
length is really classy it doesn't go
tight it's really beautiful and flowy it
just makes me feel really pretty like
like a really pretty girl taking quite a
girly girly outfit but I absolutely love
this one next I was lucky enough to get
my hands on these glasses from kee
they are the desi Perkins collaboration
with kee um this style of glasses is
just my absolute go to I think they are
so funky I think they make
any outfit look so cool and my favorite
part about them is that they are so
large I absolutely love oversized
glasses I think they are so cool so
trendy at the moment now I'll quickly
show you guys a few accessories that I
picked up I got this suede beige hat I'm
loving the Hat trend at the moment and I
absolutely love beige or this is sort of
a beige you can only color I've always
been into caps when I have a bad hair
day and when my hair isn't cooperating
with me I love chucking a hat on the
difference is I always usually wear my
sport hats so Nike or added ass and
things like that so I like having a
little bit more of a dressy cap which is
really cool another pair of glasses that
I picked up are the villians from kee I
have this pair of glasses in black and I
absolutely love them there are they're
an aviator style glasses but the best
part these ones are that they are rose
gold not too oversized but they are a
bit more oversized than your average
pair of aviators because they are a
little bit too small on my face next I
picked up this belt I've been really
into belts at the moment that have a
really nice statement buckle to it it's
not too oversized or too overbearing
that it makes too much of a statement
but again it just brings an outfit
together say if you're wearing black on
black or a pair of jeans with a plain
top this just at acts as a bit of an
accessory and just makes the outfit look
really polished
yeah I've been loving belts like this at
the moment and then finally onto shoes I
picked up these beautiful thigh high
boots I wanted a pair of thigh high
boots since I can remember and these are
incredible these are the most perfect
boots I have ever seen there are suede
fabric and they've got the perfect
amount of heel on them they're not too
high some very tall so I don't like too
much heel they are a great statement
piece to have in your wardrobe so I'm
really stoked to have a pair of thigh
high boots and then another pair of
shoes I picked up with these shoes from
Bellini these shoes are perfect this is
one of my favorite things that I picked
up from my white Vauxhall they are so
flattering because they have the tassels
that you can wrap around the ankle and I
love
love heels that are wraparound the Inc
logo with absolutely everything you
can't go wrong with a classic pair of
black heels I think they are so simple
and so sophisticated that's the end of
my white fox boutique haul I hope you
guys enjoyed it I absolutely loved every
single thing that I picked up I've been
a massive fan of white fox boutique for
a long time and I will be for a lot
longer because they just produce such
nice style such classic statement pieces
on their website which I am all about so
I hope you guys enjoyed this haul and I
will be seeing you very shortly in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
