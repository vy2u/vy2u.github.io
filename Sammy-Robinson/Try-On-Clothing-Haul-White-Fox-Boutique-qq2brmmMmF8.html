today I have filmed a clothing more for
you guys I've had so many requests
recently for you guys from you guys
asking me to do a lookbook or show you
sort of a bit of my fashion so I thought
what better then to buy to get a whole
bunch of clothes together and try them
on and show you guys how they look I've
teamed up with white box boutique today
which is my favorite online clothing
store heaps of you guys always ask me
where I'm going to get my clothes do I
go shopping do I go online what what's
the deal and yet whitefox boutique is
definitely one of the places that I'm
predominantly on to buy my clothes from
I love you know minimal monochrome
clothing but you also get the chance to
have patterns and colors and heaps of
cool funky clothing I don't know if you
guys would like to see more videos like
this where I'm showing off my fashion or
more hauls or look books or anything
like that make sure you give this video
a thumbs up and I'll be sure to do more
of in the future because I'm obsessed
with fashion and I love clothing so I'd
be happy to do that for you guys um I
also have a 15% off discount code from
white box boutique the code is Sammy 15
and yet it will get you 15% off anything
on the website so I think that is
available till April the 30th I believe
so I'll double check all that
information and of course leave all down
in the description box below other than
that I have nothing else to say except I
hope you guys enjoy the video and I will
see you in my on so the first thing I
picked up on whitefox boutique was this
jumpsuit here I love the colors I love
that it's baby blue and white I just
think it's super flattering it makes you
look really tanned if you have a tan but
yeah I picked up this jumpsuit because I
just thought it was super cute I'm
obsessed with things that are off the
shoulders so I think it's really
flattering when you have your
decolletage showing and I just love
stripes as well so I thought it was just
the cutest little jumpsuit super
nautical so I love this jumpsuit with a
pair of like little white sneakers and
maybe a big white hat to wear on the
boat or something I think would be super
cute that's probably one of my favorite
pieces that I picked up so the next item
of clothing I picked up was this
dress I love how it's sort of a beige
but it's also a little bit it's got a
bit of a baby pink undertone to it I
just think it's such a nice color and
such a nice shape the cut is so
flattering and so classy but also so
sexy so I just think it is such a
beautiful dress because yes it is tight
and it does show off your curves but at
the same time it goes down to your knees
sit down past your knees so I just think
it's super classy and it's really nice
for you know an event out another dress
I picked up was this lacy dress here
this drew my attention because it was
strapless again so not strapless
shoulderless is that yeah shoulder is it
took my attention because it was so nice
I just thought it was such a classy cut
hat I love the gold with the white
lacing I think they look really nice
together and yeah just how you can see
the gold through the way I just find it
very classy yet it also has a little bit
of cleavage there so again this dress is
a little bit sexy as well but yeah just
overall it's a really lovely dress it's
not too tight fitting it's quite
comfortable as well so next I picked up
this jumpsuit as well I saw this some
jumped bluff on my face
I saw this jumpsuit on the website and I
thought I just thought it's so cool it's
one-shouldered and then it has a big
flurry sort of sleeve off one side see I
found the colors worked really well with
this jumpsuit it's very flattering I
love the stripes the one-shoulder is
such a cool cut it's just really unique
I hadn't seen job dude like this before
so next I picked up this to pleat to
piece black sort of pant suit things um
I have actually know how you describe it
but this is probably my favorite thing I
picked up I just find it so classy but
also again sexy I love that it's a bit
midriff it shows a little bit of skin
but not too much it's tight-fitting um
so it shows off your figure really
nicely and I'm obsessed with these gold
buckles I think they are so cool with
the black and they just bring the outfit
just like a little bit of difference and
it just has such nice symmetry from the
pants to the black top
so next I picked up this leather looking
jacket um I have a leather jacket but I
lost it when I went to New Zealand in
July actually last year and since then I
haven't actually got myself an adult at
the jacket and my sword on the website I
was like ah I was perfect I was like I
was drawn to it straight away because
it's such a nice simple leather jacket
it's got all the right detailing in my
opinion sound some leather jacket out
there can be really bulky and had lots
of huge sips and buckles everything
and I'm not a fan of that I like my
other jacket to be quite as simple as
possible but have a few little accents
like things buckles and little zips and
things like that but yeah I saw that
jacket and I was like ah perfect so the
next item of clothing I picked up was
this little white skirt I've I've always
loved little denim white or black skirts
that are quite fitting but not too tight
this one is pretty tight on me but um I
have a big bottom I just think they're
super flattering and they go with
everything go with so many different
tops so many different shoes you can
just literally put anything with them
another skirt I picked up was this tan
sort of camel colored skirt I love this
skirt because it is so flattering it
goes nice and tight around the waist and
it doesn't play out too much so it still
gives you nice shape but it's not too
tight so it's not uncomfortable it
doesn't brick doesn't pull up and you're
walking
I love the lacing at the top I think it
just gives it a little bit of something
extra but I love corduroy this is
quarter as well so soft and ass and yes
it's very comfortable so the next thing
I got was the top that I'm wearing this
top is so comfortable it likes knitted
sort of fabric so it's so comfortable
just sits really nicely against your
figure it doesn't cling and it's not
tight but it does shape you very nicely
again I love the color I'm obsessed with
camel and tan and overall I'm just
obsessed with the cut of this top I
think it's just
such a flattering top another top that I
got similar color and also high neck is
this top view this one is weaved or
that's the fabric up close I don't know
how you describe it I think it's weird
actually I think I'm gonna move it up
but it's a little bit darker than the
one I'm wearing it's more of a khaki
Brown II Tan be again obsessed with the
cut of this top I love finer things
so I love this top and it does thing to
you but again isn't too tight so it's
not suffocating it's so comfortable and
yeah so like just love the square cut I
just think it's really flattering the
square cut on this top the next thing I
got is this big white jumper this is
probably one of my favorite things that
I picked up on the website it's so
comfortable goes through so many
different outfits I went with my pajamas
I wear with jeans I remember with shorts
I wear at the gym okay I don't wear it
to the gym but it just is so comfortable
that you can just lounge around at home
any chappies PJ's short or it actually
is cool enough and flattering enough
that you can put it with it like a mini
skirt or a pair of jeans and boots that
it actually looks quite fashionable as
well I'll definitely be getting a lot of
use out of this in winter so the last
thing I picked up was this orange dress
I'm very undecided by this dress because
I really love the cut of it the top of
it is so flattering and spaghetti straps
are so sophisticated but I don't know
how it looks on me I think because I
need things that are a bit tight around
my waist and maybe a little bit looser
around my bottom area because I am I am
a little bit
down there this dress does go on a bit
baggy around my waist and then tie it
around my thighs and bum it's such a
flattering and classy length the how it
goes to the knees and of course the sack
is in my evening the backless the
backless part of it is just gorgeous I
love any backless dresses so I think
it's beautiful
see I am still a bit a little bit
undecided on how it looks on me okay so
now onto the sunglasses I picked up five
pairs of sunglasses starting off with
these ones I will look up what they are
called because I don't know right now
they make any outfit look super funky
when you just chuck them on when you're
having a no makeup makeup day and you
just want to leave the house you're
looking shocking or you hungover
anything you have to go work you just
Chuck on these big bad boys and hide
like half of your face
a Viking all these all these glasses
that I've picked up from white box
boutique are from a key my favorite pair
that I picked up are the same ones is
the first ones I showed but they are
completely black they have I think are a
little bit reflective but the reflectors
are silver they're not too reflective
though that it's like blinding mirror in
your face
but but the outer frame are matte black
instead of tortoiseshell and they are
just so cool apart from key that I got
are these little ones they are sort of
aviator shape not really they have a
little bar on top of them really cool
they have soar reflectors so they're not
too big but they are still big enough
that they're I like oversized glasses so
there's still a little bit oversized
which I love and then finally I picked
up these pair
maybe ADA shaped glasses from King as
well so these glasses are in an aviator
shape they have no frame around the out
outside so it's just the lens itself but
again they have the bar over the top
they are blue reflector and I just think
they are so cool they're really funky
again oversized which I love I don't
like anything that it's too small on my
face because I have quite a wide face
and this doesn't suit me and the last
thing that I picked up off the white box
critique website was loving tan so as
you guys know Matt the tan that I use is
level 10 I actually have no effect on on
at the moment because as I've said I am
tans naturally in summer but I did i do
like to stock up on my loving tan for
winter so I beat up the Lovington
applicator met the tan removing skin
polishing glove this polishing world
removes and exfoliates your tan off for
when you want to you know do a fresh
town or just take your fake tan off this
is the best exfoliating glove I people
um sorry there's not going but yeah this
is the best that this is the best tan
removing um exfoliating glove I've ever
used it take to turn on so easily
without rubbing your skin too too much
because you know you can't really bring
them it hurts so yeah that's the best
one I've used so that's the last thing
that I picked up I hope you guys enjoyed
this haul white box boutique is my
favorite online shop hands down and was
such a good variety of clothing so don't
forget you guys can use my code at Sami
15 for a discount of 15% on the website
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the
hall
and I have nothing else to say except I
