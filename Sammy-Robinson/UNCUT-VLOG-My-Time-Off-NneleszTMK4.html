before Christmas actually so after
Christmas that I stopped looking
so we're just cooking some dinner
eh
and today I needed some time off just
from vlogging because I felt like
everything I was doing I was on that so
I just wanted to spend some time with
family friends me
in this place and then I would start
looking again when I felt what the time
was right so it's actually the 27th or
28th today I think New Year's is around
the corner we're just having a really
chilled me is because we're going to
field 8 which is a festival for it like
a one-day festival thing I'll update you
guys as the vlog progresses but for now
that's all I have to say
beautiful absolutely gorgeous little
summer outdoor dining area Oh what do we
have here
a handsome man reading a magazine he's
just on rental though I can't afford him
so now is sitting and watching the
crickets and eating pegs this is the way
she my heart just in case any of you
wanted to know it's called the chaos a
big bash just thought I'd pick up the
camera to show you guys I got my ears
pierced
so I pierced there's the normal hole so
this is just a two rings now and rings
there yeah there's my Christmas tree
it's now the 27th day so I better take
that down who's lazy it'll probably be
up this one next assembler how could
ever these nails they're like a Grinch
like the actual road it's so green and I
had you know a green morning morning I
guess yeah it's good morning everybody
it is Tuesday morning it is the 2nd of
January today yes so Nicholas I just
wanted to show you my glasses and so I
was hanging them inside and I'm just
gonna go get a coffee we went to field
day yesterday so we're a little bit
rusty and we're not doing anything today
we're probably just gonna like sit in
bed watch movies so maybe our debate if
it clears up but right now it's pretty
overcast actually it's kind of odd still
watch movies this top isn't exactly
working for me yeah sure I was out of my
shoe closet I had praised yesterday for
field day and let's just say the house
isn't in the best condition right now
one thing I've been doing since I moved
abroad or thought is that I've been
trying in different cafes every time I
found a cafe that I like to comment at
best but I'm just determined to try all
the different cafes until I find the
best one so we're gonna try a different
one today take Nick on a bit of an
adventure and we'll see what happens
yeah you usually just walk down to the
local one but I mean it drive until
apparently it's really good you have
anything to add Nicholas
we should try that this seems like a
good area for shopping and everything
and I never come here it's a nice area
I'm gonna go get a coffee now trying to
get Becky
she believes is done I had the most
delicious avocado toast and they had
prote steaks with salmon I just got
myself takeaway coffee I like to have a
take away so I can enjoy it for a while
and so now we might go home and watch
Luther
we've been watching eleuthero Netflix
which is actually a really cool show we
watched this Cena
I haven't told you guys about that and
that was just oh we were kind of that
one it was good but very confronting and
what else have we watched recently we
watched another series sued quick I feel
oh hey it's grace we watched Paley was
grace and that was really good as well
boring he didn't like that I already
love Tywin I definitely recommend that
 wait bucks check my money I'd
say nice boy
I'm down at Tamarama and having some fun
the committee boy Fun in the Sun I
understand
I got my funky glasses on
the stay right here is disgusting

gonna win would you say yeah I think so
I can't really say Oh turn your back Oh

Oh jump now
okay so I'm back from the beach now
there's a really nice day but it's cool
out and over again so we're gonna go get
ourselves some hookers cuz it's still a
little bit hungover and yes I'm gonna
get a burger and chips and we're gonna
watch Netflix in bed it's 5 o'clock and
we're already getting in bed that's
pretty good day if you ask me we are
massive grubs but we've got our chokers
and we're watching it with the sunset
hell yeah mm-hmm it's just Scottish Sun
doing outside so I've just showered now
moisturizer more fresh and we're gonna
just spend the rest of the night
watching a Luther cuz nick is still on

for me until the 8th of January which is
amazing yeah I think I'll just talk to
you guys in the morning
good morning guys
as always I've just come back from spin

so I woke up this morning and I sing a
little bit under the weather I've just
been drinking so much alcohol these last
few weeks
over Christmas Boxing Day and New Year's
Eve me as day it's just been hectic so
to make myself a lemon and ginger tea
and I'm having a probiotic and into
murica and black pepper capsule from the
golden grind I think it's from the
golden grind this and it's me and I was
like oh hell yes because I was I'd to
mark into everything like all my health
shots and stuff ins quite disgusting to
be honest so it's nice having a capsule
