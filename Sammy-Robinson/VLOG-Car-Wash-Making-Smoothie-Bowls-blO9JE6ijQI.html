going to be a little bit of maintenance
and jobs in the flat I've got a little
bit of cleaning to do and just
organizing myself because it is Monday
money and I like to feel good on Monday
mornings this is what we're dealing with
this morning I know can you believe it
that's already messy again but this pile
here is the principle Pauline right
folks going to take stuff the reason I
haven't emptied that is because
obviously I recently filmed my princess
Polly like section of my new video but
also I've got to fill my white folks
boutique haul for you guys so that is
still there this is my washing pile and
that is my washing pile I know that
majority of those clothes are going to
be clothes that I just gave away in my
last clean-out which is gonna be very
frustrating so I'm just I have to give
them back to my sisters but um anyways
I'm gonna have to go through these
chuckling some music well I'm going love
some Sam Smith good morning get a big
sleep big sleepy Rams
all right so the baskets are gone now
just this pile so I'm about to make
myself a smoothie bowl and these are all
my ingredients but before I get started
I thought I'd let you guys know I always
do a shot of apple cider vinegar before
I eat anything in the morning it's just
really good for digestion so I do that
first and so guys I'm going to blend one
banana and a few strawberries with some
almond milk and some water
and I'm gonna add these things into a
tea Bowl so I like to add some psyllium
husk this is good for fiber I add chia
seeds which is good source of omega-3s
I had goji berries as well for flavor I
love goji berries and look here - that's
a superfood I'm gonna add a little bit
of the super elixir and this body inner
beauty powder these two are both from
Sephora for has a new wellness section
to their shop and this is amazing and I
like to add this it's got like a little
bit of protein I really yeah it's got
like pea protein and just lots of good
stuff like probiotics and things for
your body so I've added the banana and
strawberries I've now just
which chia seeds add in some goji
berries full of psyllium husk just a
teaspoon of lucuma a scoop of the body
powder two teaspoons of the super elixir
it's very strong so it's not that nice
so that's how we're looking it's a nice
pink color but I'm actually gonna add in
a half of spinach just so that I can get
my grades in and this is about to turn
it for round so it's not gonna be the
prettiest smoothie Bowl but it will
definitely be good for me
yummy look at that color so I'm adding
some strawberries and some peanut butter
that was just on this bowl my sister
doesn't want Harris eyeball so I'm just
taking the peanut butter ha ha I'm gonna
put that in for my protein and then I'm
gonna add some fresh blueberries on top
because these are great antioxidants and
there you have it the most beautiful
smoothie Bowl you would ever have seen
not actually totally forgot that I
booked myself into a hot infrared sauna
this morning I booked at ages ago when I
did it with cardio exercise like oh this
is amazing I'm gonna try it and then
totally forgot about it
so I'm doing that this morning then I'm
gonna go to a meeting and then I've got
to come back and do Jessica's makeup
she's got a formal that's my sister and
then I will come home and get editing
done because I feel like I'm really far
behind on my videos and I'm not pumping
out as many as I would like to be I do
apologize for that I can tell when I'm
being slack and I will admit it and I'm
not trying to be slack but I just feel
like I've had so many little things
going
since I got back from Bali that I've
just been trying to catch up on things
so it's Monday today it is a fresh week
and I'm going to try my hardest to film
with many videos as I can even if that's
just vlogging while I'm in the mood for
vlogging or it could be a few makeup
tutorials we'll say next up I've got a
first impressions video going up and
then it'll be this I'm gonna rush off to
this sauna now it's only half an hour so
it won't take too long but then I will
chat to you guys after well that was
amazing
I had a shower after that's where my
hair so what that's not not literally
all sweat but that was amazing how many
feels so good I feel so good to have a
good sweat do you guys like my new
glasses by the way I look like a man I
had this like yeah I decided to get ones
that are a little bit more delicate
because my big square ones just weren't
that flattering and I had them for so
long so it was time for a change
there from glasses USA I was in
sponsored I never endlessly posted them
but I genuinely did bought them from
there um this is kale spinach coconut
water chia seeds ginger lemon and half
an apple all blended together so good
for you and actually tastes really good
sleepy bums a very luxurious life good
morning guys it's morning I'm going to
breakfast the day's because I haven't
seen her in a while and then I'm
actually really not sure what the rest
of the rest of the day and one of those
really old-fashioned people that still
writes in their diary I don't use my
phone and calendar so whenever I get
asked things like on the spot I'm like
I'm gonna have to go home and check my
diary let me let me give me a sec I've
got to upload a video I've got to
package my giveaway prize actually
yesterday and I'm gonna organize a
dentist appointment just because I want
to check up on my teeth I'm starting to
grind these teeth here cuz my bite is
wrong like that these teeth my bottom
teeth come out in front of my top teeth
like I talked about for me which I've
shown you guys that before
actually saying to grind and get a bit
sensitive so I just want to check on
that obviously I'm not going to do that
today but I just want to make that
appointment then I'm at the gym at 5:45
and then I've got dinner at Nick's house
so there's a few other things that I
want to throw in there as well I never
ended up going and getting my car washed
yesterday because I did my sister's
makeup and then I just came home and did
a bit of editing but I'll do that today
as well
hey days how you doing I'm really
lacking at breakfast now we're at blue
and my sister is sitting at just that
she follows me everywhere it's kind of
weird you thought about that actually
totally forgot to film what it will take
before but I had amuse like huh all
right so I have finished back here with
days I'm now gonna go fill up my petrol
tank cuz it just flashed like the petrol
thing and get a car wash because you
should save the state of my car that is
the problem with having a black car
it just shows every month so I'm going
to do that now and then I'm gonna head
home and schedule my video for tonight
and just deal with the links and stuff
for the bio this weekend's my dad's
birthday so we're going up to palmy
which will be really nice the weather
has been amazing and Sydney like summer
is definitely around the corner it's
been actually almost kind of gross like
it's been 30 degrees every day and quite
muggy and hot and not sunny there so
it's like you just have to sit inside in
the aircon but I'll show you the weather
now it's so pretty blue skies I'm stuck
in a traffic jam
so this is how I've got a cube this is a
car in front then we've got this one and
then it's my guy so just got it enter in
this code oh I'm so annoyed though
because I bought it for $18 the 1 and
then I saw as soon as I came into the
car park there's two washes the $20
idiot because I've always got to wash my
car so I really should have bought that
but isn't my lips right now is velvet
teddy by Mac which is such an old
favorite of mine I don't know if you
guys have followed me from the very
beginning like two years ago I the first
time I ever tried velvet teddy was for
my year 12 formal and the girl was like
no you want to go nude you want to go
and you have to go nude and I was like I
want brown a couple of brown I've always
been brown girl my mom used to wear
brown lipstick and then velvet teddy
became like popular lipsticks and it
wasn't because me obviously I had like
no followers but suddenly everyone was
wearing velvet teddy and I could never
buy it I was like oh like who made
this a thing I don't know but this has
been an old favorite of mine for a long
time I'm up next
I don't know why but car washes have
always scared me so much like these big
things that come next year
such a child
much better shiny and new I've just
scheduled my video now this is in
collaboration with sports girl
I just finished off doing my bio and
it's scheduled for five tonight so that
will go 6 p.m. tonight that will already
yeah now I'm just editing the vlog that
you guys have already seen as well which
was up on Thursday and then I'm gonna
begin editing this vlog as well I also
went and sat in Sun for two minutes and
ate my lunch outside which was nice
because the weather is so beautiful
today I so much prefer this camera guys
I know the other camera is like being
filmed blurring but I hate the effect
that I hate when it blows my face like I
look hate that wait for the Sun what do
you guys think there's a little bit of a
health plug but that I would show you
guys as well um in my waters I have been
putting chia seeds as well as my
antioxidants in collagen by the beauty
chefs because it just keeps me fuller
kind of I love eating chia seeds I kids
I find it super just like therapy kind
of chewing on them and yeah like when I
don't want to snack I'm not that hungry
it's kind of just fun makes drinking
water a little bit more interesting are
you doing this huh morning need to blow
my nose
it is Wednesday morning and it is 9 a.m.
and I'm off to a bondage hands event
they're holding an event at the ivy pool
I think just because
I'll be bothered to over like how weird
is that

love driving it relaxes me

really seeing it for lunch today so that
is what is on the agenda for today this
