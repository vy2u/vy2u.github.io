morning I'm very tired
I'm currently just finishing off my
makeup it's in the eighth I am and
that's not necessarily that early but I
just didn't sleep that well last night
so so you're some very tired just
wearing mix top in my PJs still I'm
going to put on my hourglass lip liner
in panoramic I'm going to take my good
ole velvet teddy
let's stick by Mac I went this today
what to do with this hair so I think I'm
just going to wear it in a bun as I
always do okay
okay hi guys so so now I'm in the car so
I'm just on the way to get holy now um
and then we're gonna go to the boathouse
and get some breakfast so
yeah Daisy's coming as well so that'll
be fun I bought a camera mount mount but
I just happen
so for now it's just going to sit on the
dashboard
all these gonna work up a bit I can tell
are you doing bro I'm so like going like
what so I got our ice coffees take belts
on
Cheers Daniels like what's my
thing - ah okay so we're dropping Holly
at spit Junction she's gonna go to uni
days and I are going to go to the beach
with his kiddies a damn hot day yo
derful day yes
hello everybody so excuse the messy
background I've just been doing a bit of
rearranging this afternoon so there's
just stuff everywhere
the last night I washed and blow dried
my hair it's got a few kinks in it
because obviously I've been wearing it
in a bun today but probably for the last
like two I mean maybe even longer when
did I get it put it a long time ago I've
been using the Philips hair care
moisture protect range which is what
basically I have the hair dryer and the
straightener and I'm honestly completely
obsessed a bit now it I'll get into and
I'll tell you guys about that but yeah
so I'm working with Philips on this on
this video just to show you guys sort of
my hair routine the primary benefit that
the range has is that it's actually very
wary of your hair's health I suppose I
used to straighten my hair when it was a
bit damp and sizzle it and I bleached it
all the time and it was just yeah my
hair wasn't in the best condition so I'm
going to be getting a little bit
technical with you guys now and I'm
going to tell you why the hairdryer
works so well so it's called the
moisture protect dryer and basically it
has infrared technology
built into the hairdryer so it can
actually diagnosis your hair as it's
drying it and it adapts to the natural
temperature of your hair so that
obviously you can preserve the most
hydration possible in your hair because
when you are putting heat onto your hair
it is sucking the natural hydration out
of it and you're essentially sort of
just drying it up so when it gets to a
point where it's getting really dry and
really hot on your hair the hairdryer
will adapt itself and then it'll adapt
the temperature so that it's not going
to damage your hair so this means that
it will stay as shiny as it possibly can
because it has the most moisture locked
in from your natural hair moisture and
then it will just be as smooth as
possible and won't be frizzy and dry so
basically with the hair dryer I found
with my hair that it has made it elack
shinier less frizzy when I dry cuz often
you know when I used to dry it would be
drives like a huge buff ball but
obviously that was last night that I
wash them blow dried my hair um and then
yep it is a little bit kinky now because
I've had it in a bun all day but you
guys can see that it's still very shiny
and healthy and I you know don't need to
necessarily do that much styling to it
this one is freakin awesome because this
device actually diagnoses your hair 30
times per second to ensure that you're
preserving your natural hydration in
your hair so that it's again not drying
it out not overheating as you guys would
find with a lot of hair straighteners
they often make your hair feel really
smooth well this is no exception I
always find my straightening my hair
with this it's almost as if I put a
serum in my hair it's so glossy and so
shiny so the actual plates itself on the
straightening move and they adapt to
your hair cuticles as you're
straightening or as you're curling
eliminates or reduces the chances of
hair breakage so if it was obviously
stuck full on the plate and didn't move
it would just rip your hair whereas this
tries to mold with your hair okay so as
you can see the straightener just gives
you that really sleek look that you
achieve in salads you leave all the
links down below if you guys want to
check it out I would definitely highly
recommend Here I am telling you guys how
I wash and blow-dry my hair and then I
completely forgot to tell you guys what
products I use so excuse that I'm a
different outfit but though I tend to
stick to the brand shoe or Maura shoe
amaura shoe Remora I've used these guys
for a long time about a year now I'd say
and I change up the products that I do
use I have used all different shampoos
and all different conditioners from them
but the current ones that I'm using at
the moment I have the shoe Remora
Moisture velvet nourishing conditioner
and shampoo which are in the orange
bottles and I've been using these for a
few months now and I am obsessed with
these when I want to give my hair a
little bit of extra moisture or I think
this is good for color vibrancy I use
the shoe or more a color luster shades
refining balm I almost read it like a
bit of a treatment soul and wash my hair
conditioner and then I'll put a bit of
this in leave it in for about 3 minutes
and then wash it out and it's for golden
blonde just makes it a little bit more
rich I suppose so I absolutely love this
I was actually going to film a favorites
video this month which I still might and
I was going to put this in my favorites
so I definitely love this and then I
forgot to show this yesterday before I
blow dried my hair but I then use the
shoe or Maura essence absolute
nourishing protective oil this before I
blow dry my hair and straighten it this
just adds that extra protection a lot of
people use the heat protectant spray
switch I do that sometimes as well but I
prefer to put a little bit of oil in my
hair and this also protects you against
heat so this is an amazing product as
well I haven't used all that much of it
but I have had one similar to this from
shore tomorrow before so this is a
relatively new bottle and yeah so I hope
you guys have enjoyed this vlog I love
you all very much and I will see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
