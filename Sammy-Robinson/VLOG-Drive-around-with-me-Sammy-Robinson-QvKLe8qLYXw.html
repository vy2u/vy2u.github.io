absolutely obsessed with it I'll show
you guys in better lighting tomorrow but
now I'm just off to get Holley and we're
gonna go to sushi train for a change so
hey guys um so it's the day after today
my hair is gone a bit funny and kinked
from my soy
even coming um yeah so I went a bit
blonder yesterday oh no now I'm in the
freakin sunlight damn it though I'll
explain to you guys sort of what I do
when I go to my hairdresser if I
couldn't really tell you last night
because as soon as I was finished it was
dark so what I do is I go to called hair
bar in Mossman and he does such an
amazing job at blondes because every
other person I've been to to go blonde
they do really stripy show me some hair
on me whereas he does freehand balayage
which makes it a lot more consistently
blonde and a lot more like full-body
blonde without having to fully diet and
getting extreme regrowth and I don't
really get extremely grenier because
I've got naturally kind of quite light
hair but yeah um basically what we do is
he puts something called Sunkiss in my
hair which I don't know if you can see
but it's kind of the warmer tone bits in
my hair but that just looks your roots
so your
it's the dark sort of streaky bits in
your hair which are they are natural
color if you put some keys in it it'll
lighten your done the darkest parts of
your hair yes so then we do freehand
belly eyes which is basically he
obviously I'll insert some clips of it
and you can see what he's doing but it's
basically doing freehand highlights
which I like so much better because
there's no foils it doesn't take as long
and it just makes much more of a much
more of a full-body blond yes I'm a
little bit blonde now for Europe I
absolutely love how it turned out he's
so amazing at doing blonde hair my hair
feels amazing he gave me treatment after
as well
and also if you're wondering what
products we use on my hair um he uses
shoe or Maura sure Maura
Shu Uemura shampoo conditioners and
styling things and they are amazing make
your hair feel so soft um yeah so I've
just pulled over now because I'm picking
