stand great yogurt by itself so I use
some honey on it some blueberries
raspberries and strawberries that's what
that looks like and I'm just going to
top it off with some of this musi liver
cleansing usually doesn't sound so
appetizing but I like to put a bit of
measely in my yogurt hi guys so it is a
Monday morning it's about 11 a.m. um
right now I'm currently just outside I
am just doing some notes um I like to
keep a notepad just to keep notes on
videos that I'm going to be doing this
is I'm just currently writing notes for
my travel advice video I like to be
prepared just so that I know what I'm
saying and if it's added an advice video
I want to be able to be giving good
advice and not just thinking of it on
the spot and then not saying certain
things like and not forgetting certain
things that are important I'm just going
to give up this silence to Sonny so yeah
that's all I'm doing at the moment just
trying to organize a few videos make
sure I have lots of videos coming up for
you guys I'm sorry as well if I always
stare in the viewfinder I promise you it
is the most annoying thing for me as
well when I'm watching over my vlogs and
I'm trying to edit my videos it's just a
force of habit that I always look over
there just to check them in focus but
I've got to try like it's almost as if
you you think you're supposed to be
looking at that like you think that's
what you're talking to but it's not it's
it's straight ahead I'm on my big camera
at the moment
to my vlogging camera still very fixed I
probably should check up on that
actually all we should check we should
talk about that okay I'm gonna start
trying to do a few favorite videos um
I'd probably I probably don't use enough
new products that I can do monthly
favorites on beauty products or anything
but I can try to do just really random
something favorites of you guys when
when I know that I have heaps of new
favorites in a month I Bambi beautiful
thing hey darling so tonight at around
five o'clock when Nick gets home from
work we're going to go to Palm Beach
with me wanting to go to Palm Beach for
ages since I got back and we haven't had
the chance to I always used to go up and
I just haven't been for ages so thought
it would be nice to take him up there
because he has Tuesday off but bill
there's a silver filling myself him that
computer can you guys hear that
I'm editing a vlog and my computer is
freaking out this morning all I did was
get my nails done I go to silly nails in
Mossman this time I got funny bunny but
I only had one layer cuz I like that
really sheer look um I will be like my
skin colour coming through a little bit
it sound so creepy
but yeah so what I asked for with my
nails is I get coffin shape funny bunny
by OPI hey this is my sister Kate she
wanted to say hello yeah a lot of you
guys are confused with the SNS basically
what SNS is it is they paint a layer of
sort of solution on your fingernail and
the new dip it into a powder and it
forms into an acrylic like nail it's a
little bit thinner than acrylics and I
believe it's a little bit better for
your nails my nails don't get as ruined
as when I had acrylics back in the day
well if you guys ask how I get the
colour funny bunny on it I opted for the
clear clear SNS and then I painted with
an actual just a just a polished so yeah
when you go into a cell and they'll
offer you a palette of colors that you
can use with the different colored
powders but I don't go for any of those
options I just asked for the clear
powder and then I always just change the
color with polish on top of that that
way it's just easier you can change in
the hour color just by taking off the
Polish instead of having to take the
whole S&amp;amp;S off so so that's my nails
there
yeah so that's all for now I will check
in with you guys soon hey ma'am so
Nicholas has picked me up and we're on
our way to Palm Beach now so do we want
to cook tonight or go out or get

hello good morning I'm doing a pan so
we've just woken up and we're going to
go get some brekkie now we're going to
go to the Palm Beach boathouse which is
usually really busy so we might not get
in but we'll give that a go so yeah
we're going to go get some breakfast and
then I've had a house in Palm Beach for
like 2 years and I've never done the
Palm Beach lighthouse wall so we're
going to do that so very nice daddy but
it's not about who take you to breakfast
I don't know if I'll log my camera up to
the m2v lighthouse walk but I'll try
take some footage on my phone anyway

yourself to help me oh yeah
