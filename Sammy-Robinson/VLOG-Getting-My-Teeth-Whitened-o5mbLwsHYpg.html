annoying person in the world so now all
I'm doing is I'm going to the bank I

special and I'm also going to the
optometrist and picking up my glasses
and then later on today at 2 p.m. I'm
going to go into the city and go to Pitt
Street Dental Center and get my teeth
whitened I'm I believe I'm getting the
Phillips Zoom whitening system so I'll
show you guys before and afters and that
that's also yeah I will check in with
you guys later for anyone wondering
ghiggia is a legato so it's a trap
truffle hunting dog from Italy she's not

purebred legato sit down high-five
yeah thank you into the bank we go
now for the optometrist hey guys sorry
that you're at a really weird angle um
so I have just finished doing all my
jobs I got my glasses these are the
glasses they are ridiculously overpriced
and I don't even like them that much but
they're necessary um I am just it's now
what times it is me well forty I have to
leave to go to my dentist appointment at
1:15 so I'm gonna point windows up so
that you need me um yes I have to leave
for my dentist appointment at 1:15 um so
I have about half an hour and I haven't
eaten today I'm really hungry so I'm
going to start off at fresh blend and
get my salad and so I got my coffee my
favorite salad world from fresh bland I
tell you guys in summer all the time
probably get
see I'm just going to race home get a
few jobs done and then we'll be on the
road and I'm going to go to my dentist
appointment so I'll speak to guys later
arrived at the dentist and I'm gonna
take my teeth whitened so I'll show you
guys sort of the process and how we do
it so normally it goes at least 8 to 15
shades my turn for the people who have
done any whitening before okay
but everybody's different depends on the
quality of enamel depends on the age
where your smoker and you diet as well I
see the result immediately is straight
after throughout the first 15 minutes
usually a two shades improvement you
should end up the fourth session at
least eight so everything was about
water within now so we're going to do
today for seven is the world's best
whitening product is called Philips
Lightspeed so the zoom brightness me
around for Asia assists the fourth
generation is the safest and gives us
best result
Sammis well great TVs nicely lined up
she's got money gum disease so she's a
great candidate for it and I think she
was going to get a fantastic yourself
first of all it's done by the dentist so
it's very very safe so if someone is for
gum disease gum recession decay cracks
in the teeth if I'm trim professional is
doing why so you catch the cause of all
my damage for example you can't burn the
gums you can cause a lot of sensitivity
on the teeth and some of damage is
actually irreversible which can be very
costly and difficult to
hair what I love about this system is
you can gives us the instant result
because what that means is after usually
at 45 minutes in our achieve that at
least eight shades whiter this sipping
piping gel is specially formulated by
Philips being a cosmetic dentist done
I've used many many whitening systems
before what I find is this job gives us
the best result with the least amount of
sensitivity so the light is doing is
activating providing gel
valleys closed sessions of 15 Minnesota
morning
as you can see semi seats are clearly
well as wine looks fantastic in the
mirror for you oh wow
so much quieter so that's definitely the
whiteness of the bridge cup and really
suits you
so I'm back in the car now I sort of sat
down with the dentist and asked him a
few questions and he covered sort of the
main things about Phillips zoom but as a
little review myself I just wanted to
sort of mention a few things that I
noticed firstly Pitt Street Dental
Center was amazing the whole team
working there were absolutely lovely
they were all so nice they were checking
on me the whole time making sure I
wasn't in pain if there was too much
sensitivity when there was a bit of
sensitivity they turned the Machine down
for me I will say that there definitely
is when people say that there's pain
with teeth whitening it's because
there's certain zaps that happen so
you'll feel like a SAP of pain sort of
like a SAP of sensitivity and then it'll
go away so it is bearable it's
definitely bearable but I won't say that
it was a completely painless process
because it wasn't but they warn you that
anyway but otherwise my teeth definitely
went a lot wider it was a really
comfortable process it didn't take too
long and yeah so I just am really happy
with the results I kept looking at B
finder in my teeth I liked the rope I
asked him a few questions about
maintenance and things like that as well
so he said obviously steer clear coffee
and red wine after your after you get
your teeth whitened and try and yeah try
not to eat any food that'll stain your
teeth afterwards yeah overall my
experience is really positive
I thought it
completely worth it hi guys so I'm home
now I thought I would just finish
blogging yesterday for the day because I
know that you can get a little bit of
sensitivity and pain after your
treatment so I thought I would just see
how much pain I would get and then
update you guys the next day and my
honest opinion is that's straight after
the procedure I didn't have a single bit
of sensitivity they put a desensitizing
cream on my teeth straight after
and it took the zaps away I would
recommend that you guys take some
neurofen and panadol just so that you
also decrease the likeliness of having
sensitivity I thought I'd just let you
guys know that just because I wanted to
see the full effect of what would happen
and they're my dogs barking again of
course
yeah it just it just feels good having a
really nice bright smile it makes me
feel so much more confident when I just
had which is when I just know that my
teeth are white and I just I just feel
more confident I also want to say which
is really important um before I end this
vlog that the dentist hour 2 has given
me a discount for you guys I'll leave
