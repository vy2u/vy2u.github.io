just decided to show you guys a bit of
my casual week routine
so yes I thought I would just introduce
this video say hello as of right now all
I'm doing is I'm just going to dry my
hair like falafel over my face so right
now I'm just on my laptop answering a
few emails and then I'm just going to
drain hair I like to after I wash my
hair I like to let it dry for a little
bit before I go straight in with the
blow dryer because um obviously Haven
hairs not good for it I've been trying
to drink a lot more water I'm one of
those girls that literally does not
drink a single single cup of water some
days so carrying around just a large 1.5
litre one bottle with me like sort of
forces me to to drink water now I have
to clean up all this mess on my bed and
put it all away ah there's a puppy dog
you like the mess on my bed don't you
you can just hide in it I just have so
much makeup everywhere these are my
drawers but I've actually run I've run
out of space and all my drawers I mean I
have to get another set of them because
I just have lots of little piles of
makeup everywhere and I just can't fit
it so yes I'm gonna have to figure out a
new storage system I do like this
storage system um it's from Ikea but
it's just definitely not enough space
like I could fit a lot more things but
it's just really packed and then I just
can't find anything because it's just so
cluttered so I'm definitely going to
have to buy a new one of them or maybe
even get like the large one just to fit
under there here's my puppy num poppy
number one hello

of the cat look at that side eye yes I
don't I don't love you gorgeous thing so
