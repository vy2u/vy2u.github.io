long maxi dress and I'm gonna go off to
the grocery store now look yes snazzy
baby okay so a few of you guys might
have seen on my Instagram but I went to
the Audi store and I got to pick up this
gorgeous car my gosh so this is the q2 I
believe and a pretty great but basically
on my Instagram if you guys so long I
essentially went and picked up this car
and I told her oh no my Instagram that
it was my hind well I didn't say it was
my name is that I picked up a new car
and I'm actually just lucky enough to be
renting it right now I already contacted
me and said did I want to rent a car and
I said hell yes so it's not actually
mine although I wish because it makes
driving my Jeep feel shameful but it is
so smooth it is the most beautiful car
it's just a really nice size it's got
the vibe of a four-wheel drive like it's
a little bigger than a hatchback but
it's still small enough and it's like
quite easy to drive it's so smooth the
interior is so beautiful never ever in
my life picking a card choose blue I
would always choose my black or white I
feel but it's actually been kind of fun
driving around in like a bright blue car
obviously I'm not gonna complain they've
given me a car and I'm gonna get take
whatever I can get but um no it's
really beautiful to drive so thank you
so much outif oh let me borrow your car
it's been so much fun it's definitely
making me feel like I need to buy myself
an Audi my fridge is completely empty
like not there's nothing in there are
views except sources and like butter and
stuff and so I've been ordering over
eight so like every meal like that that
is just too expensive and stupid and I
love cooking so I'm gonna go stock up my
fridge and so I have obviously been
going to the gym so I love eating
everything in moderation I'm not too
hard on myself and I feel like when I go
to the gym at the same time I kind of I
am able to eat kind of whatever I want
because I'm so tall I'm six foot so
everything noise spreads out all over me
so I'm very lucky in that sense that I
can eat like a pig and if I go to the
gym it seems to be okay I'll come out at
like 3 p.m. which means school time has
just school has just gone out and I feel
like when I run into a few of you guys
now that always happens I leave at this
time
just put the groceries away now no I
just spent all that time grocery
shopping huh
I stopped and got myself some sushi as
well so I got some rice paper rolls and
a teriyaki chicken sushi roll somebody
had that for lunch as my life is a mess
right now I have completely and utterly
given up on any form of self respect for
myself I thought okay so this is what
I'm gonna do now I'm just gonna clean
all of this up I'm showing you guys so
that it's holding me accountable and I
have to do it even you're disappointed
in me aren't you I'm disappoint to
myself you don't even need to tell me
and I'll talk to you after all right so
that's done that's just my pile of dirty
washing I've cleaned up in here it's
looking a lot better much better clean
floor and in here is nice and clean too
oh so much better this is your new oh
goodness this is your new spot isn't it
you like sleeping on this chair I'm just
making myself a little drink this
morning some lemon that's apple cider
vinegar in there I'm gonna put a little
bit of hot water in a little bit of cold
water and then I'm gonna pour half of
this team relic tumeric elixir in and
this has tumeric ginger lemon and honey
this is so tasty I just just drink it on
its own because it actually tasted
really really yummy but I was gonna add
it to my morning drink Schumer is so
amazing for you it's simple on a tray so
I've been trying to drink a lot of
cherrick because my skin hasn't been so
great and it just really makes this
drink my morning drink tastes a lot
yummy yeah I feel that up with a bit of
cold water first cuz you don't want the
hot water to burn any of the ingredients
I'll just drink the rest of this leg up
and they've got lots of flavors so
they've got this one they've got an
apple cider vinegar one they've got a
chopper juice one in an orange juice one
so if you don't like the flavor of like
normal turmeric they also have other
flavors and my favorites probably the
apple cider vinegar and the tropical one
the tropical beans actually taste like
it just tastes like chocolate or juice
so this drink is really good at
detoxifying the body and it just really
cleanses cleanses your body before you
eat your breakfast I haven't been doing
this at all and I wish I did it every
morning but usually when I'm in a hurry
I don't remember or if I'm off to the
gym I definitely don't do it before the
gym I should do it after the gym but I
just think I remember when I do it with
this I drink with a straw so that it
doesn't put too much acid on my teeth so
I'm just gonna come drink this outside
and I do know as well that if you drink
a lot of coffee a tip that I've learned
from Kate Somerville when we went to a
Kate Somerville event which I've told
you guys before is that if you drink
lemon water I like a big cup of lemon
water as well after the caffeine the
caffeine won't be so damaging to your
skin because coffee is like one of the
main contributors to giving people acne
so you can combat that with lemon water
okay so now it's still morning it's like
10:00 a.m. and I'm just making myself
some food but I want to precook some
veggies for tonight so I'm just gonna
get a baking tray put some olive oil on
my bed cheese and just slowly bake them
in the oven because they always takes so
long and by the time he gets to night
time I'm always never bothered to do it
so I'm gonna always try and do it like
in the mornings or at lunch whenever I
have time during the day before dinner
they'll cut them all up I like to put
some garlic and basil with olive oil I
mix it all together and drizzle over at
the top and salt and pepper and that's
sort of just the flavorings that I use
so I just like to mix it up in here and
then just put it on top okay and then I
just put it in the oven
Ellis washing machine is so hard to use
I feel like dishwasher emptying is
something that I do like more in my life
than anything else need to reload the
dishwasher
it's gonna take my morning vitamins so I
like to take vitamin C a woman's
multivitamin some fish oil and some
tumeric just some extra cherry it's
basically where I keep all my stuff that
um is sort of health-related so all my
claims powders and rose water and
proteins more cons powders chia seeds
vitamins I'm gonna make some eggs on
toast just scrambled eggs on toast you
guys have seen this before so I won't
show you this again so I've just done my
makeup I'm just gone for a really bronzy
and makeup look I'm actually off to do a
photo shoot with Jack Steele we're just
gonna do a few bikini shots because I
have to take a few pictures for whitefox
and I'd like a picture in my car I'm
gonna go do that now and I'll show you
guys a little bit of behind your things

photographer say hey Jack hey Jack how
cool is this

photographer it's nothing to do with me
