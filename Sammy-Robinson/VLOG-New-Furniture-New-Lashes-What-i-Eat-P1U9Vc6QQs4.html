I'll show you guys a little bit more of
what I bought the other day so I'm just
gonna give my kitchen a little bit of a
clean and empty my dishwasher
I always pretty much like to get that
done in the morning so that when I'm
like reloading it throughout the day
okay so I'm gonna make myself some
scrambled eggs I need to sneeze
yes I'm gonna make myself some scrambled
eggs on toast now for brekkie there's
two two eggs i scramble that with almond
milk you guys like my new sign so I got
them from Ikea
it's so cute love my little kitchen Wow
that's cooking I'm gonna give bambi some
food
so this is also a new thing in my
kitchen I used to have that big giant
brown one but I changed it to a sort of
high bar stools so I'm just gonna eat my
break and have one of my favorites the
charged clean hydration drinks this is
basically a drink with heaps of
electrolytes in it is essentially
calorie less it has 100% natural 99.9%
sugar-free it has fulvic trace minerals
and it's like prehistoric minerals or
plants something that is found
underground and it's we lack a lot of
minerals in our everyday life so I'd
like to have one of these a day so I'm
gonna sit here and have my break and I'm
gonna buy myself a new camera so I'll
show you guys what I get when I'm done
done this is so random but I actually
bought a jeans off the good American
site that's the Cloe fashion jeans and
called good American and um because I
find I've got quite a not thick legs but
like bigger legs and then I've got a
small waist and I struggle so hard to
find jeans that fit around my waist
tight so I'm keen to see how these ones
go and I'll let you guys know what I
think of them I'll try to remember to
anyway so I'm gonna buy the canon g7x
mach 2 i have the canon g7x I can't
remember if I had the mark 2 or not but
as you guys know when I vlog with it and
makes that really really windy noise and
it also makes me go really red and then
white and then red I'm gonna buy myself
another one this is my favorite vlogging
camera one of him what I've been
vlogging with recently is the Sony a 500
and I just don't like it it blows my
skin and makes me look so weird so I've
been meaning to buy another one for a
while so I'm just gonna buy that now I'm
currently blogging off my giant Canon
70d which is my like makeup filming
camera and something sent the most
exciting freakin package of my entire
life if you guys know me or well you
guys do know me or if you watch me a lot
you know that I am obsessed with
vitamins minerals Green powders like
everything woman's Maltese these
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah I'm just dying
at how clever all of it is it's one
online as well cuz I was kind of just
like looking into it I like to look into
the things that get sent to me and it
does like a survey of like you can put
in all your details and it tells you
like what you need as a vitamin which is
super cool so like if you're not sure
what you're supposed to be taking you
can go online and like take a survey
basically I'm about to go off to Pilates
but flow athletics so they have this
that's awesome fits up and it's called
fuel ignite and train and it helps fuel
your body burn more fat and boost
exercise performance so it has sort of
caffeine in it which make gives you
energy but it also really speeds up your
metabolism and burns calories while you
are going to the gym so I'm going to
take this now a probiotic one so they've
got the gut love vitamin you can have
things like kombucha for your gut you
can have things like kimchi or you can
take probiotics and so this one
strengthens your immunity and your
digestive systems I like to take a broad
back probiotic every single day I've
actually run out of my other ones I'm so
stoked to have another one this seems so
overly sponsored now but I'm just so
excited by it that I just want to show
you guys all of it they also have a
greens and collagen powder a lot of
people have greens and like protein I've
never seen anyone have greens and
collagen so that's actually amazing
because collagen is incredible for your
skin basically what collagen does is the
older you get the less collagen you
produce and that's why you get wrinkles
so if you're updating your collagen
intake that's kind of preventing the
wrinkles and it keeps the ls it
elasticity in your skin strong hello so
I haven't even showed you at my face
today which is a rarity but I'm gonna go
off to bar now which is like a Pilates
and a ballet Pilates I'm gonna walk
there and I thought I would show you a
few more things that I got from Mike
here that we've built and put into my
lounge dining area it isn't it isn't
complete and I was just gonna wait till
it was complete to show you guys but I
just wanna show you
I can't wait so obviously I showed you
my dining area and so it's like a mess
because there's still boxes everywhere
but I got this giant
raw
and this cushion I got a nice little
seating area because I feel like that
was very empty I got this hat stand
which is so random I don't really know
why I got that to be honest this mirror
which I'm going to move across and put
there and then this cupboard here is
being built all along here so that when
I get sent products I have like a place
to organize it all and I know how to do
a throw but that's my new couch and like
little dining area you see me now not
really
hey I just got home from I was gonna go
up to Bob but I walked aside I didn't
know my cos I couldn't be a grocery
shopping so I just ordered myself a
salad okay so it looks like these heaps
of like mixed leaves tomatoes olives
avocado mozzarella this hazing here but
yeah its cup it's drenched in oil I'm
not complaining I just wanted to that
bar class obviously I have a membership
that flow athletic can they do ba cycle
metcon strength personal training bits
of everything and the bar sometime they
do yoga as well heaps of yoga classes
they've got like everything and I look
absolutely love going there
sometimes at the bar it's super like
Pilates like and quite simple and
sometimes the teachers are super own
into the more like the dance aspect and
that class was then involved so much
dancing and I'm like not coordinated
whatsoever
I get really awkward diving out of other
people ballerina style dancing as well
which I we all know I'm six foot in the
last the furthest thing from a ballerina
but it's still fun um I'm going to Las
Vegas this weekend this Sunday which is
so exciting and going with Nas which is
a dream come true
if you guys have followed me for the
longest time you know my favorite
foundations and a lot of my favorite
makeup
Ben from NAS and I've never worked with
them before and that would that's me it
was always a brand that I said it'd be
like a dream come true to work with and
now it's happening and I just couldn't
be happier and I get to bring my best
friend Daisy like is that a joke
you should I go alone on trips and I'm
used to that and I'm fine making friends
and stuff when I'm there but like to
have my actual best friend there with me
will be like crazy it'll just be like a
whole nother experience that's happening
I'm seeing cardio tomorrow I'm gonna
film a milk-bone I just really want to
film another one I've wanted to for long
this time
oh good morning so I found my other
camera the one in which I don't like but
I have to use it in the meantime
obviously until like I get another one
so basically I'm sorry I didn't finish
my vlogging the other day at I remember
why but that was two days ago yesterday
what ducati hasn't filmed our mukbang so
that's actually gonna go out before this
vlog I'm actually off to go get my
eyelashes in field cuz they've pretty
much like all fallen out look I'm gonna
I'm really good I'd like a mental battle
with myself every time I do this cuz I'm
so aware that my natural eyelashes are
becoming more and more and more sparse
and it's like really scary and one day
I'm gonna like stop producing lashes but
I'm also so addicted that I got stopped
so I'm told myself this will be the last
time that I get in feels and then
basically I'll let them all fall out for
a little while and then I can get them
again by just one the mold to grow back
cuz I'm going to Vegas this weekend this
Sunday I thought I'd get the more time
just cuz it's so easy when I go away on
these trips to have the lashes I feel
like you guys have a little bit of an
info site info session on eyelash
extensions I actually have a video up on
my channel already which is pretty much
so relevant to today it does kind of
ruin your natural lashes my natural
lashes have always grown back when they
all fall out there's gonna be less of
them and they're gonna be a little
shorter just because like obviously
you've got like in a foreign object
ripping them out or like you know
weighing them down so it's not a natural
it's not a natural thing wait this has
been about three weeks and I'm now
in bills so this one's like a lot fuller
and that one's not so much but I mean I
can do a full dedicated video to it
again if you guys want let me know in
the comments so yeah that's that then
I'm gonna go do a grocery shop and I
have been listening to you guys I'm
gonna bring my prepackaged bags I know
it's really bad to use the plastic when
you're there but a lot of the time I'm
just in my car and I'm now going to keep
these things in my car but when I'm just
out going to the shops I completely
forget every time I'm like like I
don't have any what I have a few
groceries in my house that I have many
so I've just ordered myself some eggs on
toast on a braids hey bamm-bamm no you
keep eating okay she comes yeah she
found hey girlfriend where you going my
uber rates just arrived last time I'll
do it some grocery shopping but I just
get scrambled eggs
avocado is my toast actually also always
put some Vegemite on the bottom and then
barbecue sauce on top yeah right I'm on
my way to lash my ally she's the best in
the beers I'll show you guys and after
once weird one
yeah basically she does like Russian
volume on me like 3d lashes or something
mean it means that there's like more of
them they're fluffier and they're
lighter so they don't droop as much
although I will say everyone that's like
oh that eyelashes a - droopy on you
I mean Marilyn Monroe's eyes with droopy
and she's like an icon so I'm just
trying to be like Marilyn Monroe okay I
will see you guys all right that is how
they look we did get a little bit more
wispy as I wet them and as as I sleep on
them and as I do every day
life so I go to lash my ally as I said
I'll link her down below I have a
discount code with her which I don't
know she's finalizing right now but I'll
leave it on the screen here for you guys
um it's not an affiliate link I don't
make any money she's just kind enough to
give that to you guys if you want to try
out her expansions she's just moved to
st. Leonard's and
look it's my favorite drink in Woolies
and there's that chimerical it's about a
drink and there's the coaches
just at the front section here with the
drinks that is so cool
I'm gonna take a few of those guys
alright she's gonna get a few veggies
and stuff today
hey Megan sorry I don't know whether you
could hear me in that supermarket
because I just got really awkward to
speak but I was just freaking out
because my hydration thing was in
Woolies so I got I picked up the lime
hydration and the berry I can't decide
which one of my favorite but I'm gonna
have this now and I love these as a
snack it's the Chobani oats
ancient grains berry flavor and I have
that because it's packed with protein
and it keeps me nice and full oh my god
I love this
lashes look so good I can't wait to get
my new camera though like my face looks
flat Venus I hate it makes my eyelashes
look crazy to you because it's just like
blurring everything else and then making
eyelashes look like

sweet potato and some pumpkin I'm gonna
