and I look so tired I didn't go out last
night I had a night in but you know
those nights anyway you plan on going to
bed really early and being really
healthy well no I took is watched movies
until late to here and then because I
was watching movies all day
I couldn't sleep probably he's my eyes
were all fuzzy so I'm probably more
tired than I would be if I did go out to
be honest today I would start my little
daily vlog because I'm excited for
tonight and I really want to show you
guys as some of you might know if you
followed me an Instagram I've become
sort of a little pot knoweth Magnum ice
cream which they've come out with new
pints Magnum pints which if you follow
me on all my other social 's you would
have seen me devouring them velocity
wakes that's all asia s-- it's so crazy
i've literally had within within a wake
I've had over and magnum contact me to
work with them and I was like you're
kidding like Magnum is something that me
and my family having my whole entire
life and uber who doesn't use uber every
single day of their life so I'm like yes
I'll be doing a few posts on Instagram
for Magnum sort of being a little bit of
a Magnum ambassador I suppose but um I
wanted to vlog tonight for you guys just
so that I could show you me setting up
the haven't told you what I'm doing
tonight I'm having a magnum party which
is me and the girls and then Nick will
probably come as well it's just gonna be
if the weather's nice I'm going to put
the fire on like I usually do on Sundays
have some wine have some sushi have some
cheese platters and then we're going to
all be eating a lot of Magnum pints none
of my friends have tried it yet so I'm
really excited for them to try it
but I'm so excited like whoever can say
they're having a magnum party I can tell
I thought I would start it this morning
just so that I could do a little bit of
a daily blog for you guys I'm about to
go pick Nick up from his Nan's house and
we might go get some brekkie together
and then I think I'm meeting with Zoey
who's always can come help me set
everything up just the platters and
everything right sorry I'm really
rambling I know that you guys probably
hate how much I ramble at the start of
my vlogs but I feel like I have to
preface it Sal view you don't like that
I know that some of you didn't like me
just sitting around blowing about what
I'm about to do but what if you don't
want to see what I'm doing
you like like a sort of an itinerary of
what you're about to watch or you know
like a Content page this is the contents
page you can choose and you can pick
what you want to see so skip this
morning if you want to see me having
brekkie get you later okay let me see
the back nobody you tell me let's go we
have this tradition where on Sundays
usually we have been out the night
before so we want some really salty
yummy food we get the rocky stack which
is avocado tomato bacon eggs hash browns
on the yummiest sourdough pretty much
all I did yesterday was ate like all
ideas burgers chips acai bowls
pasta avocado toast peanut butter toast
Nana on it I had ice cream magnums
I had so much great it was just one of
those days were you bored and you just
kept going the kitchen and eating I
don't feel like the brekkie stack which
means I could potentially try something
new
no exciting is that it's an avocado
smash we'll see
okay so we are back from breakfast and
I'm now off to go buy some alcohol for
tonight we're just gonna get some red
wine white wine Rosa and champagne that
makes us sound like alcoholics but it's
actually just because all of us like
different alcohols some of us like
champagne and red wines almost like
white and some of us like Rose a so I
just want to cater to everyone's needs
five days in my video you're gonna
smother use check and they even had
butchers down here so this is the room
that we'll put all the stuff we'll put
the magnums and all the cheese platters
and everything there and have the fire
on and all sit around with blankie
blankie blankets I'm just have a really
chilled chilled night it's Sunday blog
