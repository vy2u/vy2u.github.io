decided to start vlogging today because
I'm about to go to a Sephora okay so I
thought it would be interesting to bring
you guys along too that I'm picking up
Stef and Katarina Williams so it's
definitely really an Katerina Williams
well they're John he my over and we're
going to go relatively soon so I just
thought I'd get out the vlogging camera
and start line here cuz I'm not very
good at vlogging in front of other
people
yes I had a Pilates class this morning I
was going to bring my vlogging camera to
the Pilates class but I completely
forgot and I'm still kind of relatively
new there so I don't really want to
bring out my camera in a middle of a
class but when I begin to get a little
bit more comfortable I will for sure
bring the camera and show you guys for
the court exercises we do so yeah it's
about two now and awesome no it's not
it's one o'clock and we're going to
leave now the Showcase is at 2:00 and
then I believe we're going to be going
to the bucket list afterwards to have a
drink or two and I'm not sure who's
coming to that but I'm just going with
Jeff and Kat so you know what else is
there to tell you tonight I'm doing
another Pilates class kids Nick wants to
do one with me it's really really good
for you so I've got Nick on board and
yeah so tomorrow I'm not doing much I
might film a video but I've pre-recorded
like three videos so I think I'm set for
videos this week but I just have quite I
have a bit of work to do in a few emails
to tomorrow but then on Thursday it's
Australia day and on Friday it's Daisy's
birthday so I thought I could bring the
camera out to those as well and make my
little weekly vlog so it's about 37
degrees today in Sydney and it's
actually cloudy as well so it's awful
awful weather it's like that weather you
know and you feel like you've just step
through a heatwave and like you
instantly are wet all over your body
because in the heat so it's not going to
be fun going down to Bondi but um it's
all good will be good and yes I think
I'll show you guys my outfit and then
I'm going to leave so the outfit today
is a top from gotham's the belt is from
princess Polly the shorts are from
princess Polly as well the bag is from
Chloe
and my watch is micro claws so I changed
my outfit I'm just wearing this top from
princess Polly now and Same Same Same
everything else so it's a little bit
more class even having my boobs hanging
out hey long time no see oh you look so
pretty
I know famously saltimbocca when I gotta
get it off my chest my boss in a
medium-sized doctrine I tried that with
a believer that they made you want to be
the one that I will be with for that
something junkie in everything that you
will name is definitely just one so many
lulululu device Elizabeth moje
disorder better they commuted back so
I'm home now and I'm just extremely
extremely sweaty and tired after that
that was just a really really nice day
and we got to talk to him to people and
we met lots of lovely people but this
weather it's literally like 40 degrees
and I was just dripping and I was so
nervous and I make I was coming off and
so it's good to be back home so I'm just
lying here now editing the first part of
this blog and I just forgot to conclude
this about to say thank you so much
Sephora for all the incredible things I
got in my gift bags I literally is the
most incredible gift bag ever and that's
been very lucky so thank you so much I
also wanted to tell you guys I forgot to
say I went to a movie last night with my
friends and we saw the past we saw
passengers and or I loved it it's like
it was really unexpected I thought it's
going to be one of those classic space
movies that is lots of technical things
and it's quite like
action-packed but it was like a romance
was really cute I loved it good angle
editing away so I've got this one and I
just finished editing my glasses on and
my oh that was fun of me oh my foots
gone so lots of videos coming up which
I'm sure you guys already seen so here's
a few of my favorite things that I got
from the Sephora showcase so funny I
showed you guys this caramel palette in
my last video and said it was Holly's
and I wanted it and then it came in the
pack
did such a pretty palette and then they
had a really nice strobe cream and sort
of liquid that's it's not chocolate abit
sticks or like a littler cure so not
matte but and then I'm probably most
excited about this a new translucent
powder cuz I always use the Laura
Mercier one so I'm excited to try a new
one

Von D brush mirrored this also is a
cover FX translucent powder so I'll try
that one out as well and some it
