day in Sydney today I'm just spending
the day doing a bit of everything yeah I
don't know what this vlog is gonna be
it'll be a little bit of this a little
bit of that dude I don't have any food
in the fridge right now like I've got
veggies and a few a few yogurts but I
want to go get some brekkie and I can't
shop on an empty stomach because I will
buy so much junk food so I'm gonna go
get myself some eggs I'm touched by
where they're gonna get them takeaway I
want to like sit in the cafe by myself I
maybe I'll bring you guys grocery
shopping what do you think
yes I'll probably bring you guys I love
it like basically my pajamas I don't
even care so this is so funny this
morning I am forgot that bin so last
week I mean this last week I forgot that
bin night was on Monday mornings and so
I had like two weeks worth of rubbish
and like when you're moving out of home
you've got a lot of rubbish him last
night it was it's not Sunday night
obviously forgot again
so I heard them at 5:00 a.m. this
morning and I really heard him - jamas
and I was like and I was like wait wait
wait really yelling at them and they
were like this is this is the planet
collections are like the grain bins not
the rubbish or recycling bins and I was
like okay
I don't like 5:00 in the morning just so
chased the people down the street
that is so excited and then it will
start up in Christ Hyatt Place
environmentally
biscuits oh oh quit the vlogging public
I tried to talk to a little clip in
there at any one day but I got my iced
latte just stir that up mmm
and I got some scrambled eggs on toast
with
do you guys like my little beachy
Christmas tree it was a housewarming
gift from my mum so I'm gonna set up
office here for now just because I've
got a really nice cross-breeze from my
backyard so I'm gonna eat my eggs
I got scrambled eggs yummy and they're
like on fire they've been put with chili
and it's on the yummiest rye bread host
so this is my current situation now this
is a mess because I'm gonna change my
shapes in a second but sometimes when
like how do honest sit down on my office
and just want to do a whole bunch of
editing I will generally just like bring
my laptop in here open up these doors
and I feel like I'm like almost outside
and it's beautiful and bright in here I
don't like to lie down on my bed too
much because it's so bad for my back and
that's like the purpose of why I've got
an office but sometimes when it's like a
really beautiful day these doors here
just like the cross breeze that I get is
so beautiful I'm going to make some
little lunch you dudes now so actually I
don't really have much grade in the
project oh god I had to go course
racially I see for the first few weeks
that I was in this place
I got a break every day and then there
was a phase there I cooked all the time
and so like it's not bad if I
occasionally get a breeze right yeah I
just had to refill my favorite video the
favorites videos are quite simple
because you just cut film cut paste
upload you know
I've decided to go again to roots so I'm
going to just heat up this thing that I
made the other night I'll show you guys
it looks so disgusting but the other day
I bought this thing from the supermarket
which was pumpkin noodles so like
pumpkin pasta and so I like boiled the
pumpkin and made that as as if it was
like the pasta and I put bolognese sauce
in there and heaps of veggies and
chicken and mushrooms and like garlic
and everything and made like sort of
like a big veggie and chicken packed
Bolognese flavored pasta so it's the
most random thing above but it's so
tasty because living at home now means
that you can't waste your food you've
gotta use what you got and I like this
go upstairs and edit my second favorites
video for the second time I probably
builded to grocery shop today so I think
I'm gonna put that off to tomorrow my
sister's coming over tomorrow she's
gonna help me out with my makeup room
just gonna organize the stuff so I think
I'll weigh that was Marcus Nick's not
here Sam I don't need to cook anything
so I'm back from the gym looks like I
went swimming but it's just my I'm gonna
go downstairs and make myself a protein
shake and show you my little recipe and
then I think I'm actually gonna spend
the night back at my parents house
tonight because I'm gonna go watch a
movie at the cinema with days and the
girls I'll go to the cinema go home have
a sleepover and then that way I can
bring my sister back to mine tomorrow
and we can get to work on organizing my
office I'm watching that murder or the
train or whatever it's called train
something something matter on a train or
something and I know that if I come back
here I'll be really scared so I don't by
the way this top is from white folks
boutique it's their new activewear range
so let's go make a smoothie hello fur oh
so here are my ingredients I'm going to
do a scoop of my lean protein from
Tripucka a scoop of my body in a beauty
powder from the Beauty chef a scoop of
how did peanut butter it just goes
better with smoothies I find it kind of
makes it thicker a cup of berries and
water I like to put a lot of water so
that I can get most of my water in and
because I don't want to break I don't
want to buy anything in the cinemas
tonight I'm gonna bring my own popcorn
and some fried frogs
I'm off to go to the movie cinemas and
then to have a sleepover at my parents
house so I will catch you guys tomorrow
just during my first load of washing
I've got another one to go here just
getting a whole bunch of rubbish and
doing whatever housework today
so I'm just gonna put all these clothes
away and make my bed done I've just
built this hat stand my hats and look
how sick this looks okay it's helped me
put my glasses in this thing
and now I'm building the rest of the
IKEA drawers hey guys sorry I haven't
updated you the last time I did you me
and Katie were building stuff for my
office I then had to run off to the gym
going to the gym had a shower and now
I'm gonna do a face mask and cook some
dinner
I feel like I've been washing my hair so
much the house seems like I've been
doing more cardio style classes like
spin classes and yeah I guess just
spinning classes you're getting a lot
more sweaty
I forgot what it was like to sweat so
the hair hair oil I'm still using is
this Wella oil reflections smoothing
treatment makes my hair feel so soft the
moisturizer I've been using on my body
which like I never really talked about
moisturizers cuz I don't stand here
moisturize myself but I've been using
this one by biotin body nutrients
intensive moisturizing body lotion it's
amazing you know often a lot of
moisturizers you use like you
moisturizing you're like did that even
do anything like your skin feels kind of
exactly the same well that actually
keeps my skin super smooth for ages Oh
so for my face mask I'm gonna try out
this sick of hair night repair and it
comes in like little pouches like
there's heaps of little sheets in there
so taking one I'm assuming I just put
this on the end of my moisturizer cuz I
can't really be hold it to wear a face
mask I'm so lazy oh no after using
moisturizer in your nighttime skincare
routine apply a moderate amount on your
face and neck and allowed to absorb
leave it on overnight and rinse in the
morning cool I love this brand
I've used this round before and it
always makes my skin like glow in the
morning oh there you are so I'm still
using my Olay Henriksen night
transformation Joel for my nighttime and
then let's try this bad boy out
so does it just like how random it's
very like gel like it's gonna feel super
stick on the face wash my hands pose
much better I feel much fresher so it
seems like it's really quite light
outside and I'll show you guys it is
very lights outside it's nice and light
the rest of the night I'm just gonna
make myself some dinner and do some
editing so I'm gonna leave you guys here
