stuff to put in your way so I think they
do a few of them I need to ask someone
one of my friends like bellifiore and
she does good boys all the time I need
to ask her how she does it because I
don't know how to do it
that's something does that time I Steve
about it okay I don't know how like what
process to use doing giveaways and how
to choose a winner in traffic
good morning so it's the next day and
I'm off to have a breakfast

recently actually and I've had this car

bad so disrespectful okay I was being
dramatic
I just don't like being late but I'm
going to make it on time well I'm gonna
make it at 10 minutes late which isn't
too bad I thought I was going to be like
half an hour late and missed the
breakfast I'll be 10 minutes late the
traffic doesn't look too bad now and I'm
gonna make it
thank you I will say this though finding
a park is either going to be very lucky
anything I'll get it one shot away or
I'm going to go around like a hundred
blocks and find a park so fingers
crossed that there is a park there for
me beautiful morning the sun is shining
I am walking
so pretty as always broadcast are you at
the summer time and I send Australia
amazing okay I'm on my way home now that
was such a nice breakfast this is such a
lovely one and her skincare is just
crazy amazing I'm so excited I got a
little gift bag of some new stuff that I
can try out because I've only tried out
a few products and I'm finished and I
love them I'll just give you a few okay
to skincare tips because you guys are
constantly asking for skincare tips from
me and I have a lot that I can recommend
you guys and a lot that I know about
skin for example drinking lots of fresh
water in your day eating as clean as
possible things like that which I will
dedicate a whole video on soon but I
wrote a few notes that she told us so I
thought I would share with you guys so
firstly she said that coffee is really
bad for our skin it actually causes a
lot of cellulite and a lot of pimples on
our skin so a way to balance out inside
the body and to alkalize the body you
use warm lemon water which I know and
all of you guys would know already how
beneficial warm lemon water is for you
having a cup of coffee a day
then pour yourself a large glass of warm
lemon water with like quite a bit of
lemon in it and that will really balance
out the coffee because coffee has really
bad oils and a lot of acidity in it
which isn't good for your skin
she said that doing cold-pressed coffee
was a really good alternative good
recipe see our skin is spinach apple
pear chlorophyll and heaps and heaps of
lemon and that will really really clear
out your body another thing she said was
LED lights like red and blue lights help
with blackheads and breakouts as well
which I'm super excited about because I
have my one from Neutrogena that I'm
trying out and so I'm keen to see if
that helps me with my blackheads around
here and on my chin so I'm just opening
up the box now that's what I've got a
big thing fired
Wow my gosh do you think has the biggest
PR packages is what the package is
there's a roller sketch and then there's
a whole bunch of melted latex I guess
that's like a lip gloss so I'm just
sitting on my couch at home now I'm
gonna get some editing done because I've
got a video part two of my Q&amp;amp;A to go off
on Sunday
and I'm going to Palm Beach this weekend
so I definitely want to get that done
today
just running got myself in the table so
when I got my eyesight I bought some raw
vegan treats but a coconut acai one
chocolate acai a chocolate fudge one and
then a chocolate acai one I'm going to
try the chocolate now and I got on
Christmas my fav um yum so I'm making
myself a little healthful shot so I just
have some lemon and chia seeds in there
so moment how to use my little chia seed
jar bit of my beauty chef cleanse powder
in there a little bit of tumeric on some
apple cider vinegar I'm just going to
add the turmeric this I'm going to go
apple cider vinegar is really good at
helping you feel full when you have
cravings as well which I'm having so
many cravings of them snacking so much
recently which like it's fine but it's
just like really unnecessary so and then
I'm adding my cleanse Beauty powder
oh that one actually wasn't so bad
because I put so much lemon in it just
come from from my Pilates Club
hang on are you are you in here you
silly doggy
what you doing you are the good girl
this is Murphy and Mavis dogs we've made
homemade pizzas for dinner tonight I've
got chicken turkey tomatoes and spinach
some pesto tomato base capsicum onion
caramelized onion and some bacon yummy
so my friend Dave told me about this
person called yoga by Adrian which is
really cool if you guys can't afford to
go to yoga classes or you don't have
time to go to yoga she does really
really amazing your classes and there's
heaps of different things like yoga -
toning yoga so wait last yoga for
anxiety and stress yoga for depression
and she just does lots of different
classes for you so it's actually really
cool I haven't done many of them yet but
um I just think it's such a nice thing
to do when you're sat home and you've
got some spare time talking to very
emotionally religiously for having a
healthy body happy and healthy so like
and one that is United 9/11
my name is very heart and wine body
