way to the gym so I thought I would just
say hello but I've got a meeting and
then we're gonna come home I'm gonna
show you guys some packages it's gonna
be a good day I'm not gonna film
anything at the gym today I'm just doing
a spin slash yoga class but tomorrow I'm
gonna bring my camera in and I'm gonna
get Ben to feel my workout you guys
follow me on instagram you would have
seen that I've been sort of showing you
guys a few of the stuff that we've been
doing in the gym a bit of the stuff that
I've been doing in the gym and so I
wanted to bring my camera in and show
you guys on YouTube
if you guys want to stay updated on like
everything that I get up to and like all
my fitness regimes and stuff then
definitely surrounding this plug right
got myself a coffee
we got a few bills and stuff done and
then I'm you know open some packages
that you guys okay jugs actually I'm
really hungry so I'm gonna make myself
some eggs I often as a snack if I'm
really hungry and have already had
breakfast
I like to just like scramble up two eggs
on a piece of toast it's really simple
but just like keeps me full till
lunchtime
I sometimes love doing English muffinz
but today I'm just going to do toast I
would have a sauce Franco put tomato
sauce on the bottom then my eggs a
barbecue sauce on top a lot of you
probably think I'm totally ruining my
breakfast but I'm obsessed all right so
I'm gonna pay some bills answer a few
emails and I have to add a little bit of
my lip swatch video um and then well I
put my packages okay I don't know it's a
package from ruthless Chloe I am just
new quotes so I kind of just wanted to
sit outside to do this vlog I dunno why
I have absolutely no reasoning because
it's not even not a nice day but just
felt like it okay I get so excited over
clothing packages it's like ridiculous
what's up okay let's do this I'm just
going to talk you through them like a
normal whole while I'm here and then
I'll probably sorry anyways and then
what I'll do is I'll probably inserts
and clips over the top of me wearing it
cuz that's my favorite thing to do like
show you guys on and like style it a
little bit right as well I'm still in my
gym gear I just did some code today so I
put a jumper on haven't even washed my
face I'm kind of courage to be honest
and these look good I'm keen take my
glasses off all right these are the
glasses they all sing yes I love so
they're just kind of like copies of gray
bands again but I accidentally bought
the wrong ray bands I got like gold
reflux and I wanted the green and the
gold say as well guys I'm gonna list
everything down in the description bar
below so if you guys struggling to find
it it'll all be in order listed down
below and I'm pretty sure I always have
a discount code princess Polly for 20%
off so that will be right here and it'll
be in the description as well so use
that if you would like it's just started
raining so I've just moved myself inside
like I'm like a little bit under cover
now so let's do this so the next classes
that I got which dying I'm obsessed I
can't tell if I just like ripped it the
wrong way now it's like stuck so let's
have to cut that off later but um oh my
god these a dope dope like you know the
tag these like my new favorite classes
these would just look so sick with like
a black leather jacket and like a pair
of mom ripped jeans they're everything
they're everything okay so next up I got
myself some jewelry I think it's all
from mink collections but I got these
cute little earrings which I might put
on now so I feel like nothing is gonna
look good on me right now cuz I'm like
just like a grub after the gym but okay
I got my mouth my whole so this is what
the double circle earrings look like
super cute I'll try them on later and
show you guys okay so it looks a little
bit crazy if it's jumper but this is the
first necklace I'm super into the
layered necklaces at the moment and
everyone's come out with like all these
crosses and pendants and stuff and I
just absolutely love them so they're so
cute
and we've got this lot slightly longer
one which is which is also really
awesome I love it this one's longer I've
got lots of necklaces that love to sit
here and are really short
chokers so this one will be really cool
to layer with all my small ones all
right so I'm gonna start off with like
little tops and stuff and then we'll
move to hey I'm just not it's not key I
don't know why I chose this background
it's just talking no I'm changing my
hair speaking of changing so it's still
a thirty minutes but I just something
about high buns and me I just don't like
it I always try and I would love to look
good in them but I just don't like it
and next I got this gorgeou 'td singlet
I just loved the color I love beige I
love that it was super loose I loved the
delicate straps and I liked that it came
up a little higher and worn tops like
that in awhile so I think it'll be
really beautiful and shapely and just
sit really nicely it's soft its comfy
I'm not gonna be getting much wear out
of it clearly because it's getting a bit
colder but maybe maybe on the warm days
I can just pair it with a pair of jeans
and okay so I got this gorgeous brown
and gray black and white
off-the-shoulder long-sleeve I basically
got this to pair with these I thought
that there would be a beautiful
combination and I just love Brown over
there a lot of people don't like brown I
love Brown something about brown and me
I just cannot get enough of it so love
those tones for winter as well so cute
next I got this little t-shirt with this
sort of cross over not thing in the
middle I'm loving this trend right now
that's come out with like the ruching at
the middle of trovich so you hear the
bird that comes in and brushes here
shapes your boobs really nicely so I
want to get a top like that as well um I
don't really wear color I don't know I
don't really wear color ever um and yeah
we'll see how it looks I
and next I got this black bodysuit this
one I love because it's backless and
then it has really nice thin straps so
hopefully this will sit really nicely so
you can see it's a really nice shapely
singler but then on the back it's like
completely backless and then it'll just
sit really nicely with your jeans and
shorts and stuff because it's a bodysuit
so white like right up then the next
thing that I got I am obsessed with
Razorbacks like so the ones that come in
like that I think it's super flattering
so I got this stripy one I've got a
brown one like this and I love it so
yeah I just think it'll go it's so many
different things get shorts denim Browns
I love a good basic singlet it's my
favorite then finally for a t-shirt I
got this one this is sort of what I'm
talking about again this is what I meant
by like the thing that comes in at the
boobs
it just it fits really nicely and look
quite sexy like when you don't wear a
bra I'm loving it I put like a white one
as well like the new trend of the moment
and yeah again it's got the color it's
the baby blue so hopefully I'll actually
wear it although I'm saying I never wear
color and I'm wearing like a bright red
jumper so maybe I'm a changed woman
alrighty now moving on to bottoms this
is probably my favorite set of anything
I've got from princess Polly because I'm
obsessed with all these bottoms and I'm
really praying that they're gonna fit me
so starting with these I wanted a good
pair of corduroy at brown shorts for the
longest time and these look like spot-on
money so I'm gonna try these on freaking
up fingers crossed that they fit me they
look so cute love I don't know what it's
been I don't know what's with me in
Browns I just love brown and yes he's
obsessed with it I was so hard to tell
when you're just like holding him but
I'm obsessed
everything I'm obsessed always obsessed
find another word totally in love
obsessed whatever with these oh I love
these days I like that look of you know
the mom jeans or the boyfriend jeans
that is like cutoff they're super old
like vintage looking old fashioned and
like you know when you know back in the
day you'd watch movies like something
like Dirty Dancing where they had those
just beautiful shorts that were just so
cool and then you wouldn't pair it with
you know like a big white linen shirt a
little like a little teeny tiny tight
top or something I'm so keen to try
these on
hopefully they'll look fab similarly
with these jeans oh my god king of
usually when I film these holes I try
everything on first fill in that segment
and then I sit down and kind of like
explain to you guys like why I love it
and how it fits in blah blah blah but I
got too excited this morning when the
package arrived sighs I
I must film immediately and then I'll go
home and get someone to film for me but
these James oh my god they are sick
they're just the perfect tone I love the
dark tone with like that white I guess
like acid wash over it because it makes
it look really worn down and like
vintage again like yeah warning I guess
I love they're worn in look and jeans
and they're super comfy and this again
with like a white linen shirt would look
so cool obsessed with those obsessed
again come on that new one and then here
we have another pair of shorts I've
looked at these on the side of princess
Polly for ages and they've actually been
sold out for ages and I was just came to
pick these up they just look at so comfy
and they look like they would just go
with everything
white black color super cache again
probably would've been better for summer
but I just I know that I would wear
these next summer in it and in any
warmer weather so they just that really
nice linen
texture really classy you can dress it
up with heels or just wear it with
sneakers or sandals and it's like a
beautiful baiji tone that will go with
everything and then finally I got this
cool romper jumpsuit thingy which I
think looks absolutely sick those really
thick like I don't think were like kind
of straight down big wide legged but
like kind of cut off cool jumpsuits
which I've actually been looking for one
for ages and so this one looks really
so I'm having this looks good and I feel
like this print is really in at the
moment probably always in to be honest
but I just noticed it around a bit so
yeah and I like the delicacy at the top
of it because when the bottom is so like
why I didn't thick and hasn't doesn't
have much shape to it it looks really
cool when the top is really delicate
like like this so it really shows off
your dÃ©colletage really nicely to say
yes that is everything that I got I'm
came to go home and try them all on
so I'm just gonna do a bunch of editing
now and I'm gonna head home I feel like
I always say this in my vlogs but I've
got a film video from Maybelline I feel
like I wouldn't tell you guys unless
like if if it was here in my house
because the studio setup that I have is
um at home it's always a sort of like a
day trip that I do I will just head home
for dinner tonight
stay there cuz my grandpa's in town so I
get to see him have family dinners I'm
gonna take all my ski stuff back from
Whistler it's still here like its
unpacked but it's still here so we're
gonna take all that home because it's my
parents stuff so I feel like I wanna
have a shower wash my hair and get my
self together looking presentable for
you guys it's so many Easter eggs guys I
can't stop eating Easter eggs like I buy
like one of those mini packets of Dairy
Milk Easter Egg little mini ones and
it's just every single day I'm just
