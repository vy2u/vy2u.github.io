see my face I'm just off to get my nails
done with days unseen days in a while
it's been a hectic week with the launch
of my princess Holly stuff which reppin
something right every single day is
probably getting stopped the cool thing
about this camera is it's not as big so
I just feel like I can take it around
with me a lot more than the other camera
the other camera was good
I just don't get why so popular I can't
stand the fact that it made my skin so
blurry I hated that you made my face so
flat and like cooperative like my lips
and no
made my eyes and eyelashes so intense it
just is hurtful so this is a before
looks like hey days is coming is
that good what color begone fall deep
deep red for winter
very nice wearing none other than semi
brother since this poly this one this
various quarter but like everything
we're gonna be watching all this
Lighting's not great yeah that's what I
need this is my nails Oh per second this
is the shellac per second so much medics
my nails were disgusting okay look his
repens Oh mom you look so cute though oh
my gosh
camera shy so don't show you guys a
little full-length shot of my outfit but
you can't really see it let me find a
better mirror I'm so happy about this
camera like you guys have no idea so I'm
wearing my linen shirt with my Robinson
jeans and I'm just wearing some sneakers
with it I'm just super chilled I just
love the shirts so easy winter and
chilled and this is I need to update you
guys on like what's being restocked and
everything because um I have no idea at
this point so I'm gonna call princess
Polly and get the hold-down though on
all that because I need to be able to
update you guys I don't even know also
this is my old room before I moved up
into the flat when I were lived in my
parents house this was my room I had
this little cute room
there's my little wardrobe I didn't vlog
at this point so you guys would never
have seen this but this is my now my
sister's old room as well she's moved
out she's moved upstairs because we've
all we've all left but I got this
because I'm obsessed with mermaids and
how beautiful is this artwork that was
my favorite thing about this
I was literally like I was like sixteen
or something so I wasn't a baby or
anything but I just have always loved
mermaids so so I've just shot some
content from mecha I just did like a
little take over I love doing little
takeovers it's fun because it's like not
on my channel so I just showed like a
little mini version of my skincare
routine on their Channel so I got these
beautiful flowers sent from princess
Polly someone's had their day but I'm
just gonna add them all together and
hopefully it'll just revive it a little
bit got myself a new hat this hat size
cuz it doesn't make my ears stick out so
much usually helps come like right down
here maybe I like it it seems hopefully
long though
oh and I got another one this one's kind
of cute actually fits my head that's a
good sign
I like to that's cute these are from the
iconic by the way I just ordered them
last night
the fat miner bird is back I haven't
told you guys about these many birds but
I've got two little friends that come
and sit here they sit here and wait for
me to open the door and they eat Bambi's
food and they're just the fattest minor
birds like they literally come in and
they eat all of her food there's two of
them every time as well they're like
obviously together they're dating their
little fat birds that love each other
have you guys seen Shrek when the bird
like is singing and it like blows up
that solution about these minor birds
remind me of they are so fat because
they eat or whammies food they're gonna
explode absolutely freezing in sydney
right now so I am now get the bug in a
rug I need to put these on and then they
still just complete my look I feel like
such an incognito celebrity walking out
behind us freezing like freezing for
Sydney I'm sorry I know whenever I say
freezing in Sydney arounds like a new go
up cold it's not freezing but it's
freezing for me I find it freezing
that's like oh yeah my finger um I
jumped my finger in a door the other day
in a car door it was such a bad jams I
had to go the doctors and they had to
drill my fingernail to get the blood out
before my nail literally popped off
because you know when if your finger is
bleeding the pressure is getting the
pressure of the blood is getting stuck
underneath the nail I have never been so
much pain from a tiny little finger just
I have to put like little holes in your
nail and just like squeeze all the blood
out and so it feels a little bit better
it's still very sore but when I did that
at the same time I actually went and got
my tetanus shot so my whole arm this
whole Armada that can't really move so
if I'm really stuck in this video and
not being very expressive because this
arm I can hardly lift past here that's
also why my hair is such magic I dip it
in the high button so go me anyway
give you guys a bit of an update about
the princess Polly thing we are
restocking the favourites so don't worry
about that all your favourite jumpers
and linen and all those pieces are
coming back soon but when we're most
likely going to be doing sort of like a
pre-order link a pre-order thing so that
if you guys instead of it coming back in
stock and it's selling out straightaway
and you guys missing out again
I'm gonna have a link that you guys can
sign up for and you can get whatever you
want and then it'll get made on the spot
for you which might take like four weeks
and it'll get a sense rate to you so
yeah stay tuned for more info on that
and when I know for sure I will let you
know every time I've gone to give you
guys a life update you've always been
like clickbait click bake because I
haven't been talking about a certain
subject that I know you guys all want me
to talk about and that is about Nick and
myself I am a public person but I'm a
private person and I don't want to
constantly share every single thing
that's going on in my life cuz sometimes
I don't even know I'm a 21 year old girl
going through Knowle 21 year old things
and it wasn't a good idea or it wasn't
good for me it wasn't healthy to just
share everything online and have
everyone else speculate at the same time
as me yes Nick and I did break up a lot
of you guys have guessed that and that
is exactly what happened I didn't tell
you guys straight away I was a little
bit down in my videos and a lot of you
picked up on that but which was lovely
and a lot of you guys were being really
lovely and sending me lovely messages
which was really nice and that didn't go
unnoticed but I didn't feel ready to
talk about it and I didn't really want
to talk about it so he didn't cheat on
me I didn't cheat on him like I said
before a lot of people have made up a
lot of rumors and are trying to
speculate which I mean I completely
understand if you guys think one minute
me and Nick are really happy together
and the next one up together
cools people gonna make some really
weird rumors as to why it happened I'm
in the public eye people are always
getting guess some of the rumors are
hilarious it got to a point where
everything he did was affecting how my
day was kind of thing so I don't really
want to go into it too much we needed to
take a step back and work on ourselves
without each other I knew I always loved
him and I didn't ever stop loving him
but I think we both needed it and so we
are dating again and we're dating slowly
we're just taking it slow I'm not going
to go into the ins and outs of our
relationship but so we're not together
but we're dating and just yeah I just
think it's important to take it slow and
I don't want you guys I guess the point
of why I'm telling you guys
now as I just want you guys to stop
speculating it's not a bad person and it
has so many bad rumors going around
about him it breaks my heart wanted to
remind you guys not to listen to rumors
because I know it's so easy just to hear
someone tell you what actually went on
and then just to believe that and then
go and tell some else but really if you
have no proof of it how do you even know
that it's true and I found myself doing
that a few recently with things that
have left their partners and I've heard
that that person cheated on that person
and I've gone oh yeah yeah probably this
happened and I catch myself doing it
with other people and I'm like damn this
is what like this is what people are
doing with me like I've been getting so
angry that people are spreading rumors
about me and they don't even it's not
true and I know it's not true
although I'm in the public eye some
things you just don't want to make
public and I just want to keep this to
myself for a bit and you know like I
never made Nick a massive part of my
vlogs so it's not that different to you
guys and I'm sure he'll pop in and out
every now and again but you know I've
never really publicized our relationship
that much so a few of you guessed and if
you didn't but I didn't think it was
that important to tell you guys because
he just wasn't that big of a part of the
social media aspect of my life and it
hurt and I missed him a lot but I just
knew that it was the right thing to do
and it's made us stronger now 100%
because he's okay he knows he's okay of
his own and I know I'm okay on my own so
all we do is complement each other's
lives as opposed to you know depend on
each other's lives I guess as well the
reason I've struggled to talk about it
up until now is that I've although I'm
on social media and I'm okay with sort
of telling you guys about me and myself
I would never ever drag someone else
into the public eye like there was no
need to and also I think it's um I guess
weird because you never know what's
gonna happen in the future like I don't
know whether me and Nick will be
together forever and I don't know what's
gonna happen or whether we will get back
together and I all I know is that we're
trying again and we're dating and if it
does fail like I was like I don't know
like I know I'm not going into it no
thinking it's gonna fail but like what
if it does and then I do
want to tell you guys and then have it
fail again and that's always a very
scary thought so yeah I just wanted to
end this vlog on me just Scott sort of
giving you guys a little bit of a
down-low as to what is going on in my
life I haven't had the chance to thank
you guys for supporting my line that I
did with princess Polly as well so thank
you guys thank you do any of you
beautiful people that bought anything
I've been sharing a few of your photos
and you all look so stunning and
everything and it's been making me so
happy watching you guys in wearing my
stuff so keep the keep the photos coming
I love watching and I love seeing and I
love that you guys are enjoying it so so
I just wanted to update you guys so I've
gone back on the pill and basically you
know how the pill can have lots of side
effects like gaining weight it can make
you hormonal it can make you Moody so I
started taking this supplement it's
called Ella and it's every lady's a lie
and I love that basically this is the
coolest thing I've ever seen in my
entire existence
and I believe it's there anything like
this in the market I've never ever seen
anything like this before it's basically
it fills every nutritional gap that can
be caused by some medications like the
pill so so whilst medications including
the pill have their benefits it can
leave us ladies with some gaps in our
nutrition scientific scientific studies
have shown that medications like the
pill can deplete your body of some
important nutrients in but impacting a
healthy mood energy function and mild
fluid retention I got sent when I got so
this ages ago with you guys on camera
but I wasn't taking the pill so I didn't
think to take this one but now that I am
it replaces nutrients such as folate
vitamin b6 b12 and magnesium it boosts a
healthy mood and energy function reduces
mode' fluid retention and bloating and
reduces stress and moulting anxiety so
it basically just fills any of the gaps
that you find when you take like birth
control pills which for me oh my god I
know I get Moody I know I get hormonal I
know I get bloated as hell so that's
what I would show you guys that because
I think this is the most interesting
thing I have ever seen in my life
they've killed it with their stuff from
sup like I fully finished weight and
he'll get it fully finished the
probiotics that they sent me because
these are the gut loved ones and
definitely needed some got loving
because in winter 80 like an actual pig
so I just like to make sure I'm taking
supplements and vitamins and getting a
little bit of nutrients in me I finished
it so sup yeah girl up and I think they
have another one actually that's and
then they have this one as well which I
don't haven't taken out but it's called
a tit Tom ttom and it's been that time
of the month so your monthly pal for PMS
and this one this one is for people that
more get really bad period cramps and
things so for the pill for me on the
pill the pill gets really period counts
me this one relieves cramps Maude
bloating stress and irritability reduces
mild PMS symptoms reduces fluid
retention and breast tenderness and
boosts your energy and mood so this one
is so cool as well I just find these
both so freakin clever is it sad that
getting a new washing machine is like
the most exciting thing that's happened
to me all week I got a new washing
machine and a new dryer oh my god that's
when you know you've become an adult
this type of stuff excites you good
morning everybody
so
watch again it's extremely freezing well
kind of cold I'll show you guys my
finger I've taken the posture off so I
can show you now it's healing a little
bit better that those are the holes that
we drained all the blood out of my
fingers so puffy how funny is that so
puffy the now looks like it's about to
pop off I apologize for how random this
vlog was it was extremely jumbled up I'm
not even flogging last week and then
didn't continue to vlog because it's
been rainy and I just kind of had some
time off after my princess Polly launch
