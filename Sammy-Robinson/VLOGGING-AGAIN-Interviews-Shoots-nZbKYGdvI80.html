these eyelash extensions for out because
I'm so sick of them I don't want them
anymore
I don't want them anymore super breaking
I'm having two slices of toast with
peanut butter and banana this is like my
favorite break here at the moment
hey guys sorry didn't talk to you on the
way here I totally underestimated my
timings I'm here now I just just drove
here but I couldn't find anything to
wear I didn't know where I was supposed
to we're breaking out so just run out
just looking look beyond I'm wearing
jeffree star celebrity skin so here now
I've got 5 minutes to make it inside I
think it's in there so I think I'm
buying butter remember last time I came
to this studio I got stupor hopefully I
can remember this time scene to put my
shoes on
I always leave myself off now to get
ready and then I always do my makeup in
like 15 10-15 minutes because I don't
really do anything not crazy with my
makeup but I couldn't find an outfit and
I was stupid
I already cut you in there
I just finished my shoot and now I've
just gone into honest goodness goodness
honest honest to goodness and bought
myself some stuff I'll show you guys
when I get in the car
can't even see if I'm bit dark there
those are the fun I enjoyed that a lie
around we're super nice the crew is
really easy always helps when you're
working with such cool people
so yeah I'm go ahead right now I'm kind
of glad that I only took a little while
because so much editing to get done
today it's not even funny so I'm going
to go home make so much and edit for the
rest of the afternoon
you guys probably can't even hear me and
then tonight I put Pilates against the
gym this morning I'm going to play
tonight yeah I thought I would do a mini
car whole whole car car haul I really
love my hair the hair ladies did such a
good job because I always I told them I
was like okay I heard my hair and I
really don't know where my hair out
front into honest-to-goodness and I got
myself some peppermint tea I love having
this every night after my meal because I
ate a lot of food at night and this
helps aid in my digestion I got this
called tumeric latte mix which I've been
loving tumeric lattes recently and it's
got turmeric cinnamon cardamom ginger
vanilla chili black pepper so they're
all really good ingredients as well
got heaps of kombucha I love commercials
just stocked up on heaps of those this
is pink raspberry lemonade I got apple
and I got how this was the kiss or
something and then I got a vanilla
Osment yogurt because I love every night
having strawberries and yogurt I really
want to try coconut yoga and see how
that goes
this is all I got a good apple cider
vinegar I have read all your comments
telling me that the apple cider vinegar
that I'm using is wrong
I just kind of didn't care I just used
it for so long so I was like yeah same
thing but I finally got a good apple
cider vinegar anywho let's go home I'm
going to drive home drink my kombucha
it's 2:30 right now which is grapes that
means it's not like a whole day left to
get heat and stuff done by the way I
forgot to show you guys I've had two of
these protein balls from new foods as
well a lot of this is our what made it
what not that this is our what I eat in
a day video but I thought I will let you
know
g15
on this dry time and I just been
thinking about this giveaway things I
announced my license and to you guys
it's been like a week half a week I
don't know since you'll sort up log but
to me I said that yesterday so I think
instead of announcing a giveaway every
vlog because what if this is three days
later and I've got two going and you all
want to just don't think that works
every two weeks I'll do a good way to
show that it's not good what if I blog
like four times in a row and then it's
every three days it just doesn't really
make sense I mean show me so this is my
lunch I've got a nice big salad with
chicken pumpkin food potato broccoli
Thai green curry sauce some weirdo caps
go good morning guys in the next day I
didn't vlog last night because Herman
boy I went to Pilates made dinner and I
was just doing editing so I thought that
would be pretty boring for you guys but
it's a fresh day I've got my
collaboration with Jessica s'appelle
this morning difficult adaptable clues
but I thought I'd show you my little
breakfast on the go I've got two rice
crackers with peanut butter and banana
and I've got like five little
strawberries in there and then I also
have a kombucha this one's hibiscus kiss
which I bought yesterday I didn't make
sure big of a breakfast because I know
that I'm making some movie bowls with
her this morning when she's showing me
like some smoothie Bowl recipes which we
come I have a feeling if I'm making
smoothies many bowls we're going to be
eating them going to be really rude and
then just like eat all of it same time
so but I'd make myself a little snack
and then I'm seeing cardio we're going
to get to lunch and then I don't know
