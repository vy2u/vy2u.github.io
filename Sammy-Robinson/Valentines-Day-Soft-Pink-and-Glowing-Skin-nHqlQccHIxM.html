I thought Valentine's Day is coming
around soon so what better time to do a
little pink inside Valentine's Day look
it's yes and I have a dog back there
I didn't properly make my bed kiss could
you sit on the end of it so let's just
ignore that so to begin I'm gonna start
off with my Charlotte Tilbury at
Charlotte's magic cream it is the most
beautiful packaging gauge okay there we
go it's just a really nice thick
moisturizing cream I haven't used it all
that much I can't really give you my
honest opinion yet but um I'm liking it
so far I've broken out all along like
forward actually deep pimples as well so
it's really painful so because this was
going to be a really girly look I just
want to keep it as girly and vibrant and
pretty as possible so I'm going to add
it from Charlotte Tilbury a wonder glow
instant soft focus primer so I picked up
some type products the other day and I
am of set for two new favorite additions
they taught for any parts of the face
one foundation and eat our tech tech
concealer which you guys would all know
about for sure so I'm going to take a
little bit of this Tarte rainforest of
the sea foundation I hope probably take
a little bit more than I usually do just
because I've got so many pimples on my
face so I'll just try and cover there
cover it all up so I'm just going to
blend that into my skin with my Beauty
Blender
it reminds me a lot of my NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation I've got
that really watery light weight coverage
so I am going to be cliche and I am
going to be sticking by the classic
Valentine's Day look just doing the
gorgeous baby pink rosy colors so it's
going to be very girly and very flirty
and very pink but I personally like
wearing our Valentine's Day so I'm going
to be using a vertical shape tape can
feel
in medium now can we leave it under my
eyes and probably a little bit of my
pimples as well I know they said I put
the one shown on your pimples Julie on
hygienic but I don't really care I'm a
rapper without of course what can I say
and ten reviews Linda to blend that in
so what are you guys doing for
Valentine's Day do you have any plans
if you don't doesn't matter as well
often every Valentine's Day I'm in my
bed working out blick so I kind of mix
this year I'm gonna use a lot of cream
products today I want to show you guys
some of my current favorites at the
moment I would done makeup look in a
while so and been able to show you some
of my faves the NAS liquid look Laguna
bronzer is awesome because it's so runny
and it's not too dark so I just put a
little bit where you would normally
bronze V blender and sort of blend them
into the skin now my favorite thing at
the moment is this clinic with oil it's
pop oil within sheet and it's in the
shade rose globe and this is my favorite
thing ever so you just take a little bit
of it and you just put it on your cheek
bone so Nick and I are going to learn a
little bit we're going to will inland
Wharf which is like one of my favorite
places to go to eat just a really really
nice place it has really really
beautiful restaurant and we're going to
manager I think so if your natural it
looks just looks like you've you've
flushed you're blushing another product
that is new and I've been loving the
moment is there Zoey's Astro gel it is
in the shade Corona gels does it feel
like it feels like one of those parties
have you guys ever made puppies over the
ice it's really nice because it's really
subtle trick the boys into thinking that
we're going when really unlike pimply
and pasty so another new product is this
coverfx translucent black powder and
I've
using this at the moment to take
underneath my eyes oh hold up
everywhere and I've been loving it so I
love my Laura Mercier translucent one
but this one is just as good I reckon so
I always make my eyes whenever I go out
because I just think it's just the best
way of setting my eyelids I use banana
powders on an everyday sort of basis
because I'm just out during the day like
running errands but if I'm going out to
any events or going out to dinner or
lunch or anything like always baked but
onto the eyes I thought a perfect
palette for Valentine's Day is the lorac
unzipped I shadow color and it's just
got such pretty pink toned shadows so
dig into unconditional this show just
here and I'm going to run that as my
crease color I know you guys always say
the idea the same looks and to be honest
I notice that I do do the same looks
quite often but I mean it's what I do I
love more natural makeup looks like I
like using makeup to enhance your
natural beauty so that's just generally
what I like sticking with and there's so
many amazing youtubers out there that
you can go to for dramatic looks like
Michael Chen she has incredible makeup
tutorials shining groom and even has
like incredible tutorial shows like cut
creatures but I'm just I'm just not good
at them so I'm going to stick to what I
know obviously I'll try and switch it up
here and there like the colors I use in
the products I'm using so that I can
sort of show you guys what I'm using and
where I'm loving at the moment so now
I'm going to try and create a bit of
stuff flirty eye so I'm going to really
deed not the outer corner of my eyes
using unspoken and yeah he's going to
place that roll on the outer corner and
just sort of keep it there I don't want
to blend it in too much on it to really
elongate the eyes this will sort of lift
your eyes beyond Gator eyes and make
them look like flirty
it's how I would describe it
for Valentine's Day to stick with the
baby pink and I'm just going to take
that on my finger and run it all over my
lid all those so pretty now I'm just
going to brush the excess powder under
my eyes away I'm using this awesome Kat
Von D brush so I'm going to take a bit
of the same color and I'm just going to
put it on my inner tear-duct of my nas
brown gel eyeliner here nice brown gel
yeah mine are on I dealt gel eyeliner
closer together and I wanted to do a
wing
I'm not gonna lie to you guys I'm
terrible Owings it's quite a dark brown
but it is still brown it's better for
beginners and it's just a lot more of a
subtle way of wearing a wing so I'm
going to doesn't stuff up my look really
I'm really not good at it I don't draw
my eyeliner all the way across my eye I
keep it on the outer edge so I'll show
you guys what I do so I'm going to draw
a line and then I connect it inwards
I'm going to draw a line there and then
connect the line on the outer edge and
fill it in sorry like probably knowing
them in the camera
okay so that probably loses all when you
even but you guys probably get the gist
I'm not good sorry I'm not trying to
teach you how to do eyeliner at all I
just I'm just going to lightly define my
eyebrows I got them came to then pick
like pretty dark already but I'm just
going to lightly define the fronts of
them using my Kevin Kwan brow pencil so
if you guys are wondering what is on my
chest making it look so luminous and
sparkly it's my loving tan bronze
shimmer cream in dark so the blush and
highlight I'm going to go into my
champagne pop split pan and flower child
that that's the champagne pop and that's
the flower child I just think this is
such a pretty color for Valentine's Day
and then using that the highlighter
image as well
down my nose keep it slow Albin on the
spot brow bone lips I'm gonna get you
that one of these bareMinerals
lipstick lip paints lip gloss I got sent
a whole bunch of them at bare nude
collection and I think it's already come
out in the car pretty sure it is it's
not as coming out very soon
and then it's got the most beautiful
range of news they also come with five
lip liners as well I'm going to line my
lip with genuine lip line it in on point
so then I'm going to go in with the
staying matte sorry the Matt um liquid
lipstick in flay because I always go for
matte lip so I'm going to go put a
little bit of gloss over the top of it
because it's pretty and it's Valentine's
Day oh whoa oh my god there's such a
smooth lip gloss and look if you want
your makeup lasting all night long all
date all day whatever you guys are doing
even if you're sitting in bed it you
want it to be last thing I'm just going
to spray some urban decay or hide a
setting spray I think the finishing
touches I'm going to go into my Elie
Saab let her fume Resort Collection I
believe it to a spring scent but oh my
gosh it smells so good smells like
lollies hope you guys are lipstick on my
teeth cool so I hope you guys have a
fantastic Valentine's Day no matter what
