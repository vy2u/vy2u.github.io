wisdom teeth out four days ago

sweet potato chips I think now I check

so I just got back from breakfast then
Nick just dropped me he's got up to a
folk now I'm just going to answer some
emails and do some editing hello my
babies i lo oh I left my other glasses
in my friend Georgie's car so I've had
to wear these these old ones and they
just the dorkiest looking things by the
way I always always get asked by you
guys what my other reading glasses are
like sorry where they're from I've had
I've had them for so long and they're
like the brand has rubbed off on the
glasses so I think they're from Percel
but I'm not sure I like it like I said I
got them so long ago so I don't know if
they would still sell them and I don't
yeah I don't know where they'd be
available but I got so many of you guys
asked me that and I've never actually
addressed where I've got them from that
I think there might be personal
so I'm just finishing off editing the
vlog so far it's bit long inception for
me because just been editing the last 10
minutes of what you've been watching but
um yes I'm gonna finish editing just do
the last bits of my emails and then
hopefully my mother will come home
because I want to go test drive my Jeep
because I'm buying a Jeep when I get
back from Europe so hopefully I get to
do that today
if not I'll probably do that tomorrow I
actually have no idea where my mom is
yeah I'm buying an all-black Jeep
Wrangler the two-door just feel so good
when you can work so hard and then buy
yourself something like that it's just
the best feeling because like when you
were younger thought of even buying
yourself a car was impossible but now
it's just yeah
the best feeling so I just got a big
delivery yeah so this would be the stuff
that gets sent to me because um it goes
to max connectors first and then they
send it all to me so I got a whole bunch
of model coaster um I got some Burberry
Artemis or however you pronounce that
this package I don't know who that's
from though so I'll open that up after
some clinic card got a few big cards in
there
I don't know what the I think they do
like the chubby sticks have a trophy so
I wanted to try these got a Givenchy
loose powder some mode ever had and some
label em body lotion and that looks like
some shampoo and conditioner and some
nail polish what I get from what okay
slowly here two wipes wash and emit a
liquid lip and a lip gloss that liquid
lipstick looks like a nice color some
mascara and some body shimmer oh I'll
try those modal cosell beauty blenders
so there's a one hour tan and an
airbrush in Econ turns and a bronzer
some eyebrow like an eyebrow theme
shadow sticks
a highlighting trio our duo highlighter
Thank You model Co that's so generous
Burberry has sent a foundation and a
lipstick I've never heard of Artemis
before but they've sent just a whole
bunch of boxes
oh it's eyelashes so Artemis oh I hope
I'm pronouncing that right is just a
very luxe eyebrow eyelash brand so thank
you Ottoman Artemis I hope I'm saying
your name right so this is monsoon berry
100% natural hair mask good and 25 year
old ancient recipe to cure damaged
lifeless hair so the envelopes were just
my invites to the juicy shaker event and
