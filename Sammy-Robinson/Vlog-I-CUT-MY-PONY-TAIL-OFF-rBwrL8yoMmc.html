bring your own
but you can bring your own wine which
would be nice so nice little date night
with him I've haven't talked to you guys
in ages haven't blogged in a while I've
kind of forgotten how to like everything
I'm doing just picking up a camera and
like talking about it or like showing
you guys I haven't done in a while so
getting back on the bandwagon but um
yeah it's a sweetened like it's a weak
feeling from not looking and starting to
bloat again especially when people watch
you look I gave her that comfortable
about it but now I'm gonna start like I
really want to do like ideally I would
love to do one vlog a week and then one
beauty video a week or the sit-down
video or something like that so I'm
going to try to do a lot more but we'll
see how I go it's like 25 degrees which
is not 30 degrees so any excuse to wear
a beanie right when you're embarrassed
to vlog in public so you hold it down
there it's a pretty good angle how you
doing yeah so it's 21 degrees today can
you believe it it's freezing not really
gross like can I put some makeup on go
on the scar on but it's not really
cutting it is it and but I'll check in
with you guys later all I'm doing today
is hanging out with Holly so I'll update
you and something important is happening
but right now there's something
happening yes Holly catcher walk of
shame doing the walk of shame naughty
girl not really that's just Laura's
house hello my friends Oh what was that
doll MB yeah you sleeping takeaway pass
my bed really grace the dog sat on it
and I have to wash it guys I feel I've
already failed at this log I just I just
thought I was gonna have a really
entertaining weekend and look the
weather wasn't great and it's just other
things could turn out like I thought it
was I also don't have that many friends
so when my friends are busy I'm just
like what the do I do going to
attempt to do the cupboard so I'm going
to attempt yeah no time for the IKEA
drawers together by myself what do you
think what do we think yes hello kiss
for me
nope well I'll give you a kiss you guys
like the paintings behind me that's my
major work from school I do art in your
12 these are the clothes I emptied out
of my wardrobe and I'm giving away I'm
just going to give them to people in
need obviously I'm actually kind of just
procrastinating right now because I
don't really want to put my cupboards
together that works that's a human eye
that's an octopus eye and that's Abby's
eye basically my theory was that we all
kind of remember we all see we all have
different eyes and we see the same thing
in different ways basically I did a lot
of research on different eyeballs and
how different creatures and things see
and I created the paintings that I
actually had the main component was the
video that I created I showed the same
thing so for example an object but how
each different creature would see it see
the video was mainly the main component
but kind of it really remember like how
I came up with that and what they have
to get behind it was but anyway well
I've been through the whole box laid
everything out and it seems there's no
instructions well who
so couldn't find any instructions in the
box so I disabled it how handy getting
there so we built the drawers and now we
run to the shelf so I don't have all
that much space in my room I've only
ever really had room to fit my bed and
I've always had it underneath this thing
so I've switched it over to this side
there's where I film excuse the mess but
so now I have a little feature wall here
to put some plants for my background and
then I've just built these drawers and I
have another set to come as well just
put all my makeup away so that I can
tidy everything up so so we're in the
car again I thought this whole blog is
going to be again in the car actually
washed my hair and it's all frizzy so I
just like donor it out look really red
in this lighting what on earth so today
I'm is it a of jobs I'm picking at Poli

a whole bunch of these crates so that I
can put them in my drawers and then only
me I bought incense not really a sense
it's a diffuser
I bought the Akoya diffuser in Sweet Pea
and jasmine and I got the candle version
as well because I'm obsessed and then I
got myself on a Christmas tree so cute
just just don't watch this next bit if
you get creeped up by like really weird
things but basically in high school I
had very very long hair and when I left
I decided to put in a ponytail and cut
it off um and I just found the party I
need to like throw it in the bin now but
I'm cuz see it there is the reason I
kept it was I wanted to donate it to
like a hat like a you know there's those
cancer research funds that you can
donate your hair to you can actually
like give your hair to them to make
extensions and weeks but I put I
researched it and you can't donate it if
you've dyed it anyway so I couldn't give
it away so I must have just like kept it
somewhere and I just found it that's so
gross Oh
