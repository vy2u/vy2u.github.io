parade and all the clubs you get in
using my name you think you broke my
heart oh girl for goodness
don't forget I want to say I think I'm
getting ish of the video um the tan that
I use is loving tan it's like the most
commonly asked question I get and yeah
so I use loving time in the two-hour
express in dark I'm actually naturally
very Brown so because it's summer I've
been lying out in the Sun a little bit
which is not very good for you but I go
very Brown when I go in the Sun um so I
don't like to fully fake tan and right
before and some are using ultra dark or
anything it's just before events or if I
have things coming up I'll do like a two
hour Express before I go if I just want
to top up my turn you know it's the best
hand though like even though I'm really
Brown and it makes me super Brown it's
got the darkest formula of any fake town
on the market I'm pretty sure so
definitely use loving time if you're in
for a really dark time so yeah I thought
I would just address at the beginning of
the video because so many people asking
that question
yeah so I just finished my makeup then
this is sort of my go-to look lately
