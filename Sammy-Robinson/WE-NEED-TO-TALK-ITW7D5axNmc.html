you're gonna make all my clothes very I
love it when you do that I really love
it
cheeky little thing good morning
everybody today is a new day new blog um
I just really quickly wanted to show you
guys my shirt my camera is flashing dead
so I don't know how much of today I'm
going to be able to vlog all I'm doing
is going touring the mall to do some
Christmas shopping with days um yes I
thought I would just show you my shirt
it says I work hard so my cat can live a
better life how relevant is that to me I
don't know mom got it for me when she
was in LA this is a ridiculous look how
red I go in this friggin car let me go
pick up days we're gonna go do some
Christmas shopping I haven't bought any
one Christmas presents yet I love buying
presents for people so I love doing
Christmas shopping and so I'm just gonna
go
and find some stuff for Nick and my
family I'm wearing the most embarrassing
shadow I was like haha this is so funny
when I left and now I'm like why do they
weigh this and then this lipstick is by
Kylie Jenner it's the lip liquid
lipstick in Malibu
looks a little bit light on me I think
looks a bit funny like a bit grey but
something different always wear the same
Smashbox lipsticks I thought I would mix
up
I made a massive pile of janna order
because I went on her website and
there's heaps of the lipsticks available
it was free shipping internationally and
look at me it was free shipping
internationally and it was also 20% off
so I was like I may as well just buy
everything and I bought this one in
which is Malibu and then I bought one in
coordinate Moon which is a similar color
but a little bit darker and yeah I just
thought that they were really cool
because they're like gray toned and I
don't really have anything like that so
wearing that today don't know how it
looks but she thought it gets a little
bit different um what else what else
after the shops today's I am going out
with Holly tonight it's Holly's last
night in Sydney before she goes away for
a wit for a witch for a bit so gonna see
going to sit we're probably all just go
hang with Hull tonight and what else I
have so much cleaning to do all the
packages that arrived in the last vlog I
have them sitting around my floor so
I've got to clean all of that up and by
the way if I cut off it's because the
cameras flashing dead so I'm I do
apologise
a little boy
I literally don't know how I managed to
get my room so messy time to clean done
this is my Christmas shopping done
good morning everyone so I'm just Carly
doing my makeup this morning I have a
few things I need to do today just
running some errands really I'm going to
Topshop today this afternoon and I'm
doing a fitting because I'm going to be
working with them again so right now I'm
just putting some eyeshadow on I'm using
this color from makeup geek which is
frappe I used this today I got sent it
the other day it's the girl on
terracotta bronzer and oh my god
how beautiful is this packaging I'm so
I'm just using my steal a huge extreme
lash mascara now I'm taking my Kylie
cosmetics liquid lipstick in brown sugar
so I'm feeling the need to address one
of the videos I uploaded um last week or
this week whenever I upload this video
um it's the drugstore makeup video that
I did with girlfriend and covergirl I
don't mean to be a negative Nancy but it
just really upset me how many people
were commenting things like you do only
ever do collaborations you only ever do
this YouTube channel to get money it's
all scripted and like usually I don't
like comments like that get to me
because I know that it's not true so it
doesn't matter to me and I've never felt
the need to say anything because I just
don't think it's important so I just
wanted to say and I hate the fact that I
even have to say this but I just wanted
to make sure that you guys know that I'm
not doing this YouTube channel just for
collaborations and just to get money
this YouTube channel is my job now I
have deferred from uni and I've quit my
pub job so obviously I need to make a
living somehow but I don't do it for
that sole purpose I started this channel
as a hobby and out is something that I
love and it's continued to be a hobby
and to have this as my job I don't want
any of you to think that I take it for
granted because I honestly every single
day I feel like the luckiest girl in the
world to be doing this oh my gosh I'm
sweating even talking about this
but yeah I know a lot of youtubers say
this that they would never do a
collaboration that they don't love or
that they don't truly believe in and I
stand by that fully that is not
something I would ever do and I feel
like if you guys know me and want to
follow me for me then you guys should be
proud of the collaborations I'm doing
because I am so proud of the companies I
have worked with like I would never in a
billion years have started this YouTube
channel thinking that such amazing
companies would know me and would want
to work with me so I don't want you guys
looking at it like I'm selling myself
out for money and I'm doing this for
money it's like it's something that I'm
so proud of and I'm building a resume of
companies that I'm working with and
doing videos for them and it's
collaborations that are so exciting to
me so it really upsets me when you guys
think I'm selling myself out or I'm
doing this some money and you don't look
at it like you're proud of me for what I
do or that you know like I don't really
know how to explain it but if you do
feel like you think that I'm doing it
for the wrong reasons
then just don't watch my channel I am so
beyond excited whenever whenever I get
collaborations with clothing brands that
I actually buy things on offer online
like the fact that they want to work
with me makeup brands you know
MasterCard like any brand that I work
with is like beyond exciting to me you
guys need to understand that this is now
my job and I need to make a living one
way or another I want you guys to be
proud of me for the company as I work
with so um I mean I wish I could tell
you guys how many collaborations I
turned down like I bet you all the
youtubers you watch where you think
they're selling themselves out to
collaborations I bet you they turned
down more than they actually accept so
yes I just feel like um I feel like I am
being a bit sensitive I don't know why I
usually don't like comments get to me
but I just wanted to address that
because it upset me that you guys
thought that literally this channel
would be nothing if it weren't for you
guys and I just I know I don't say that
enough but I'm but yeah you guys are
what what makes this channel I read all
your comments I've been trying to reply
to almost every single comment
stays I take a good few hours of my day
every day to try and reply to comments
and I want to engage with you guys more
so I've started using Twitter I'm
terrible at it but if you guys want to
follow me on that I'll leave all my
links in the description I try and keep
up to date with everything because I
want to engage with you guys more I've
been trying to vlog more so that you
guys can see more into my life and you
can get to know me more I mean I could
do a billion things right and then I
could do one thing wrong and it'll be
held against me so that's what makes me
so nervous about YouTube because I just
want it to be I want my platform to be a
really positive place where we all get
along we're almost on 300,000 people and
that is literally mind-blowing like when
you really think about it that is so
mind-blowing how many people that is and
I can't believe it and I want to thank
each and every one of you from the
bottom of my heart for sticking with me
um I literally never thought it was
going to be like this when I started my
youtube channel I didn't think anyone
ever does I used to it have fun like
it's such a nervous feeling when you do
your first video cuz you're like you
have no idea where it's going to go what
it's going to do but it's just a fun
exciting adventure and when it gosh what
it took off I was just like it's hard to
explain the feeling because you never
expect it to actually take off and it
kind of is a bit of a whirlwind this job
is a lifestyle this job is it's time
consuming because it's not like you can
go nine-to-five and just finish there
it's a lifestyle it's people know you
people comment all the time people have
opinions on you all the time so it's a
really nerve-wracking job really you
have to have a very strong sense of
self-doubt this job because sometimes it
can really get doubt get you down
but that's why I just want to thank you
guys for being so positive with me
because I mean I have the most positive
subscribers and you guys literally make
me so happy when I read your comments
it's I'm so lucky it out of you so but
but I just I really wanted to say that
get that off my chest
what else do they want to say I don't
know I'm all sweaty now
so it's a very gloomy day today in
Sydney so the lighting is awful but yes
I'm aside from that long spiel I just
had I hope that didn't take up too much
too much time of this vlog I think it
probably would have taken up at least
like 10 I just felt like I needed to say
it because I've been thinking about it a
lot recently been in the weirdest mood
these last these last few days it can
really get to you and like I don't think
you guys know how much you actually
affect us like we read your comments and
you truly either make me really happy
and then there's a lot of there's a lot
of things that can really hurt our
feelings like we really listen to what
you say so
I want to move on with this vlog so
let's let's change the subject right now
I am just off to go to the doctor's I
have to get another pill prescription
why is your number plate different hi
there my sister's where you going
where's my invite again they've been out
twice without me
eating what the hell
well that's my sister for you man I am
going to Topshop later on to do a bit of
fittings because I'm working with them
again see ya I'm taking my sister's into
the city later and we're going to do a
bit more Christmas shopping gonna get
some Haig's chocolate Haig's chocolate
is the best chocolate in the world we're
all obsessed with it I'll show you guys
what it is it's like a gold frog it's
beautiful by the way down here now
because my camera is being a little
box but where I'm park I'm not driving
like um but yes I'm getting my hair done
tomorrow I'm going darker again I'm so
indecisive I go blonde brown blonde
brown but I just like darker better and
it's way easier to maintain so not like
dark chocolate brown like I did last
time but I'll probably go like a caramel
color so hopefully that'll be good and
then this weekend cardia days Laura and
Biss and I are going to soundscape which
is a music sort of day Sydney at the
factory I think
it's got my tie salad for the day
yummy from fresh blend so I got a
suggestion from one of you to include
the details of my outfits in each vlog
just so that you guys know what I'm
wearing so the top is from general paths
the choker is from princess Polly shorts

this jumper is from country road but
it's vintage and my Burke's are from
princess Polly anyway I'm going to do a
bit of editing now and then we're gonna
