more casual right I am just going about
good mix house we're going to go to the
movie so I'm just going to do like a
light layer of makeup just because my
face is so white compared to my body
going to use my Maybelline Dream cushion
at foundation and because I can't be
well go to wet my do blender I'm going
to put it with a brush I lost my little
spongy thing so I know where that went
and come out of Austin at Secret Garden
it's going to be like a really light
layer because I'm just sort of evening
out my skin tone I don't want to have
too much makeup on today but I do feel
like I look pretty rundown so to sort of
try and make myself a bit more fresh
this brush is amazing it's from it
cosmetics they're heavenly luxe flawless
foundation brush and that is exactly
what it is heavenly and luxe I'm not
sure what we're seeing I think we might
I've put it in his box I've seen Lyons
and as I said I've seen a few movies
recently and he hasn't so it's totally
up to here I'm gonna use a tiny bit of
my shake head concealer like literally
just one dot under it try because I'm
tired you know what's funny is like I
don't know if you guys can tell this is
still swollen
I literally just ended my weekly vlog
like half an hour 20 minutes ago last
week and I'm like starting this long
again like it never really ends for me
like it looks like it's like a week
later for you guys but I just keep going
like I keep rolling out the the weekly
blogs a pretty well start as soon as I
stopped sometimes like I'll put a day in
between but it's Sunday today so easy
just to with the vlogging camera out I
don't think I have much battery life so
I'm not really going to be able to
too much you guys know Nikki doesn't
really like being in videos so you back
that I'm going to use my clinic chubby
sick in Kobe contour a little bit more
want I'll Jose I'm not going to do much
and then I always end up doing like a
hundred steps and you guys like Wow not
much makeup stuff I don't use I use all
the products I use very small amount of
each products so like it's not actually
that much makeup it's just like a lot of
different products I'm going to use my
clinic pop oil blush with so much cat
fur on my face hopes of having a cat who
wears all over your makeup
yes but I'm using my Clinique pop oil in
rose globe this is like my favorite
thing ever
and that's it I'll probably put it a
little bit of lip balm on and that's all
I do just makes you look a lot more
fresh and awake and what I was before
just because I'm healthy I just look
kind of pale in the face how gorgeous is
that
go first I'm just on my way to get a
coffee this is my little old mother is
feeling relief stick around go go get
her a coffee to make I feel a little bit
better I was at Nick's this morning now
into his last night for dinner and I
didn't bog I just wouldn't do that none
of his family that I did that would be
weird if I did that I feel but um yeah
so we just had pizza and watched movies
and it was really nice Sunday night to
chill out and do nothing I did nothing
the whole weekend
which was actually nice I feel very
rested this week so it's just got that
and I've imported all I've done is
import or mimic a footage so that I can
get that uploaded while I go get a
coffee and they'll come back and we'll
edit it I don't know how I'm going to
edit it or what style I'm going to go
with because I want to make it kind of
fun like I've been trying really hard
with my editing lately so I really want
to make it really interesting to watch
but um yeah so we'll see how that turns
out I think that that will be going up
on Wednesday so that will have already
been up you guys that have already seen
it yes I need to make a habit of telling
you guys what day it is because
otherwise I feel like it's just so
confusing so it's Monday morning at the
moment and I'm off getting a coffee
okay I was like um do you mind if I just
fill your cups he was like okay right oh
let me get my commands lager
um so though I thought so highly of
myself
this is Kiki's room I get is your bed is
in your bed it's not actually her
bedroom I'm just kidding
if you like sleeping on this bed this is
a spare bedroom that usually my cousin
will sleep in
I don't know obscure she's been on the
vlogs but this is usually where he said
and Gidget thinks it's her bed so
whenever he's over she's like no she's
like no just like you you know be big
this might be gold girl tie little lady
I love you my picky have a good sleep
already so you saved my faculties and
now I'm just going to go upstairs and do
a bit of editing okay I'll check in with
you guys later

coming so we're just happen to my camera
there has to be an explanation for this
focusing issue it just can't be it can't
be like this not allowed to be like this

already seen it but just a really nice
blue sparkly probably look if you guys

below because it'll be able already be
up definitely for sure um yes so I just
filmed finish this movie now I finish
the treatise but yeah so I'm really not
going to be getting up so much this week
like I'm just I'm just trying to pump
out the videos and edit so I can't
really includes much entertaining
footage in a weekly vlog when I'm not
doing anything but filming and anything
you know what I mean so we always cream
sell for me like I always think oh god I
didn't film very much it's not going to
be very fun but then I always end up
having enough footage so we'll work it
out
rude okay so completely forgot to vlog

Pilates and now I've pulled up a car
