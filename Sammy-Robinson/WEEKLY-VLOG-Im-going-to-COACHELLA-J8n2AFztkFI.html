Holly and I bought something from my
comics that is look terrible and me and
then I'm going to go to office wipes I'm
going to go get myself a huge the office
chair because I am so sick of sitting on
my couch and anything I swear I'm going
to become the contract of Nostradamus I
keep doing that so it's time to get
myself a big office chair and a desk and
just possibly like a normal human so I
mean I'm going to get a big massive one
for winter that I can put the blankets
over the top of and that cuddle Costco
up into but it still is great for my
posture and I wish Pilates this morning
so do not exercise trying to get myself
on track and starting things coming goes
thank you this lipstick is one of the
new benefit lipsticks I'll link it down
below

in the car but I got myself some new
pens highlighters and I got some SD
cards can never have enough SD cards

computer keeps jumping up and running
out of space so yeah and so I've just
got to go home and do some editing now
and then this afternoon I'm doing my
sister's makeup for their rowing dinner

sleeves but anyway it is currently a
10:00 in the morning I'm on my way to
Alexandria to go to a GHD event cardio
is coming along with me and I'll see my
managers and stuff there I'm going to
Coachella so I'm going to Coachella I'm
going to her show up like so it's pretty
pretty exciting I didn't find out until
sort of two weeks ago and it's all very
rushed and very sort of last-minute but
also very exciting never in a million
years I think that I was going to be
doing this year
when it all kind of at the last minute I
thought I don't know how to express my
excitement on my camera exactly like I
know I'm just going to edit it out if I
just start screaming but in my mind I'm
screaming yes on the 13th I will be
leaving for LA and then the were staying
in a motel in Palm Springs and then
after the meeting I'll be coming home
and having breakfast with me because I
had seen him in like a day but those
days are sailfin we like to get
breakfast come back head breaking of him
and then deny what I'm doing so I like
to I like to give myself those days off
purpose of his day off as well so I'm
hoping I don't have to do too much work
but I do have a lot going on at the
moment so we just have to email answer
emails and just to standard stuff like
that but um yeah I will check in with
you guys on there but we think that hi
yes
getting my hair done when Caroline today
we're going to go for the bohemian miles
away let's go ahead soon so sorry I
forgot to vlog at the thing showing you
the after of my hair but it's got some
nice bohemian waves from the GHC stylist
and I got a cute little clapped in it as
well
to practice for my Coachella hairstyle
p.o Wham hey hey mmm

long hike there hey good morning guys so
I've made myself a bowl of porridge and
a peppermint tea
currently 8:30 a.m. and it's quite
chilly outside so I'm just going to sit
inside and get a bit of editing done
before I get some work done I'm just
watching Bella's video she's come out
with like please new mystery chases and
it's so good I'm actually enjoying them
so good job Bella okay so it's now like
10 or 11 or something
I'm meeting kardea for a quick coffee in
every bit of a debrief about Coachella
cos she's going to where I get my
eyelashes done and I'm close by so so
I'd come get a coffee with her and then
sort of around 1 panel and a lead to
Alexandria to go to my manager's office
close because we're getting our stylists
to show us our outfits of coachella hair
is discussing such a mess
there's a paper out where it's not like
straight or curly just like poofy and
kinky and groove I seriously need a car
mount I just can't believe are gone this
one with that one considering I've loved
all the time in my car
hi guys
so I'm sitting in bed at the moment as
in my vlog I hate my freaking hand
gestures I hate that I do this every
time I blog I just woke up as well so
it's 9:00 a.m. I've been editing editing
for about probably 45 minutes just
getting this weekly vlog done I haven't
had time this week to edit this vlog at
all so I'm just looking at the footage
now and realizing I haven't got much
footage and it was a bit of a week that
failed weekly vlog I just had so much on
my mind and I've been trying to organize
Coachella and I'm just I've actually
really annoyed at myself with is because
I should have brought you guys along to
all my fittings and all my meetings and
everything that involved the Coachella
process I just didn't I kind of was just
very distracted by this look so tired
I've just been very tired I had a lot
going on but all my preps for Coachella
is going to be happening still so like
I'm going to get to the hotel when we
get there and I'm going to be fake
tanning and washing my hair and all the
stuff that I would do for a festival I
would I will still be doing when I get
there so if you guys want to see all my
prep for Coachella when I'm wearing
everything like that is going to be in
my Coachella vlog and then I'm going to
have a vlog of my trip to LA as well so
I'm going to have two vlogs coming up of
the 7 days that I'm in LA so I am
leaving tomorrow morning at probably
like 6 a.m. and then I get back on the
22nd so leaving on the 13th getting back
on the 22nd which is where they like
seven days to us in LA but we've missed
a few days and Sydney the time
difference blows my mind every time but
I will have started my Coachella vlog so
keep a lookout for that that won't be up
to that won't be up too long after I
mean I'm sure I'll have some time
while I'm there and if not in LA I'll
have some time to edit lime edged at
night I mean there's some three videos
line there I'm going to be filming a get
ready with me so I'll do one of the days
for Coachella I'm not going to film
every day but one of the days I'll show
you what makeup I do my outfit and hair
and then I'll have the to vlog so keep a
lookout for that I'm very excited and
sorry to how absolutely ratchet and
Tyler look this is probably not the best
way to end the vlog but I just
definitely wanted to jump on here before
I finished this log and give you guys a
proper endings I do suck at ending my
vlogs a lot of the time but yes so today
I am just running hate friends I've got
to go to the grocery store and buy
things like band-aids and panadol and
stuff because I feel like I am getting a
bit of the flu so I want to get some
cultural and stuff that I'm not sure
I'll be able to access wherever I am
like we don't have our car we don't want
to just be catching you but everywhere
that I am going to wash my hair shake
hand everything when I get there so
there's not too much preparation that I
could involve in this log except for the
styling and really bummed at myself I
didn't include that but anyway how could
