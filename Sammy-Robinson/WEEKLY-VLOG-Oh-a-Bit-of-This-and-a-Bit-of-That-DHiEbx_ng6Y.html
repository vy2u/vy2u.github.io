hello welcome to this look I'm just
starting off this vlog because Laura and
I are about to go take a few Instagram
photos for my Instagram it's the Topshop
so I'm wearing top shelf at the moment I
only brought my big camera to take
photos so I can't really vlog what we're
doing but maybe I'll insert some of the
photos that we end up taking so that you
guys can see them I'm going to go to
like a different location I'll take that
is somewhere else today but I don't
really know where we're going so I'll
show you guys where we're at and what we
get up to but I'll tell you guys as I'm
going this week and yeah so we got back
from Secret Garden two days ago and I
was so exhausted yesterday that I just
didn't film anything but um it was a lot
of fun it was a shame that the weather
was pretty rainy but we're still we're
still super super funk yeah so welcome
to this week's vlog
are you okay
photos are done didn't really get much
footage down and obviously we were
taking photos
I also took a photo supreme back so
they're my favorite bags every part is
all the time I thought I'd show you to
view it's really nice nice so that's our
I was wondering if you want to do well
power attack I just need some pressure
I'm going to go to the doctors now and
pick up my prescription I read out so I
need to go get small doctors are so
annoying how friggin I have to pay $30
just to get a prescription and then on
top of that have to pay the money for my
pill I find it so frustrating like I get
it but it's a prescription all you're
doing is renewing a prescription but
anyway I'm going to go do that now and
then probably make some dinner and then
choose and edit some photos for
Instagram and I put up my top shot video
tonight I actually haven't looked at how
that's going
I'll answer some points and say hello to
your eyes and then yes that's all I'm
doing tonight

this beautiful bunch of flowers because
obviously you guys know that our
collaboration is out now so you can
check out all of our campaign in Mecca

I came on his own I've now forgotten is
the pile of clothes on my for from the
meetup today because I did not know what
to wear and this little one has found
her way on top of it wouldn't exactly
say little one but um as me hi I don't
know why my camera's not focusing

very well lately and it's really
stressing me out my camera died before

oh good luck let me have you said hello
to your sister yeah okay thank you
that's enough yeah I think for the
restaurant privilege is going to be
watching YouTube videos and editing a
bit of today's vlog because I'm super
excited to see how that sort is turned
out it's lying on a toilet roll as you
do I'm kind of sick of this camera it's
like obviously doing these focusing
issues but I kind of want to get a new
vlogging camera I wanted to get the Sony
a 5-1 hundred but apparently that see
Selena Lang but apparently the sony
a5100 ver heats a few of you guys told
me that it overheats and it's not good
for vlogging so if you guys have any
vlogging camera suggestions that isn't
the canon g7x i would love to know thank
you thank you nigga I'm watching
Michael's videos now he's the funniest
person alive you guys have to check them
out if you haven't
I thought Megan it's been like half
Ellison but I look like everything
exactly as I thought I thought I could
do like when I remember to be obviously
I'm not going to have a new YouTube new
youtuber that I'm in love with
every single week but when I do have
like a new obsession I could sort of
include it in my weekly vlogs and show
you who I'm watching so my obsessions at
the moment will have been for ages is
Sharron Farrell and Karima McKinney
they're both from acts connected as well
and because I'm from X connectors but
they are both just amazing I just like
love their personalities they seem like
the most genuine girls ever other than
the way creamer does her tutorials is
just so to-the-point precise and awesome
I love her tutorials and I didn't
understand dicted to watching them so I
thought I'll show you guys that now I
love I love hearing about lots of
different youtubers that I could tell
you guys like who I'm currently obsessed
with what I do have a new obsession so
yeah so I'm currently watching Sharon's
video the Australian supermarket makeup
challenge and this is karima that's both
of them actually that's creamer and
that's Sharon zareba yeah she just does
the best tutorials gloomy day yet again
in Sydney I feel like summer is
officially over I've working out with a
fully fall and eyeball what the heck but
it's off ugly nope maybe on I can do no
I mean you know I was going to cover
this side of my braid so I would show
you guys actually in this vlog just
friended while I was four and I will
it has been my current obsession at the
moment I don't like wearing makeup at
all every day anymore like actually
foundation except for like a few of my
thin ones are just really annoying me so
this by Terry T to turn a face and body
spray is the best thing ever because I
just spray it on my face and it
instantly makes my face cans like my
body because I go quite pale on the face
during winter so I'll show you guys so
basically look
see but I'm going to put my glasses on
because I feel like my eye is really
confronting and end the vlog I hope you
guys enjoy it and I will see you very

able to see my meetup blog at the
editing way today it's Sunday so it's a
very gloomy day and perfect day to edit
