currently about 12:45 in the afternoon I
had my first well actually no I had my
second personal training session this
morning and I did boxing and my wrists
are like jelly I thought I can't even
move had some lunch done some work and
now I'm asked to do a fitting with NACA
media doing a fitting for Fashion Week
so they have a few things there like
Tommy Hilfiger and various other brands
I'm not sure I'll see when I get there
and see if anything looks good see if I
like anything that I can wear for
Fashion Week and then I'm going to stop
by car DEA's on the way back so that I
can say hello to her haven't seen her
since she's been back from LA soon
tomorrow is the weekend so I think I
might be going on a boat tomorrow and
I've got my friends 20 set on Sunday so
should be a good weekend so this is
today's outfit I feel like it's so hard
to ensure you outfit post these days
because didn't fund their egos this is a
vintage bounty from Harley Davidson
these pants I got from the Glebe market
for $5 they're just super comfortable
wearing my Gucci bag and my Gucci slides
they look like you know this camera's
gonna go in the car where the camera did
not fit very well so for the contents
show I have heaps of time to kill to be
honest I'm leaving an hour early and
that's what I did this morning and we
did boxing and my god
even wrapped my wrist because I've got
quite like dingy little wrist boxing
gloves like a wrist guard and still my
wrist feel like I've been trying to
write things in my diary and make notes
and things with videos and I could not
do it took like 5 minutes to like
actually builder Yampa said I kick
boxing is hard and I respect people that
you're boxing but I forgot to show you
guys my nails in last blog said I was
going to get them done I don't think I
showed you so I'm these are my new nails
though I a mysterious
dirty I hate watching my vlogs have got
dust all over what I cannot believe I'm
driving right now and you guys are
staying still I hope you i actually i
wonder if you can hear up a little
rattling noises i've noticed that in the
last vlog it was really rattling noises
and I think what that is from is it has
little clips on the side of the camera
where you switch with the neck brace on
and I haven't put it on but I think
every time they can remove their little
metal thing straight
and you can hear it but I haven't feel
like it's really going a bit crazy right
now I'm just going to stop here some
some petrol actually because my light
just came on
perfect timing that I'm next to a petrol
station or but it's pretty busy pretty
busy or do I do it yes I do it
there's nothing there oh yes I didn't
stop that alrighty I'm going to stop and
fill my tank up so chat later 33 so I'm
back in the car Nell was way too awkward
a little hidden there and I got courier
and I coffee my outfit so I just got two
dresses two jackets and still not sure
what I'm wearing but hopefully I can
integrate it somewhere
I need to Google like how to use Tonya
whatever

gonna buy would turn feed each other how
I get outta the view from the facts I
want to change my mind

gnarly living here I'm always leaving

just spent the day editing this week's
vlog that's going up tomorrow and also
into Pilates this morning yes so
currently has just been trying to figure
out the damn outfits I want to go quite
girly this year I think is frills and
pleats and stuff are really in so
thinking of that but still very unsure
at this stage yeah after Pilates I just
washed my hair but treatment in my hair
because it's just really really sad at
the moment and I'm just wanting to make
a little bit healthier for Fashion Week
I might do a few treatments or like a
treatment now and then a treatment on
Thursday before it starts and it's put a
face mask on because I don't have
anything planned this afternoon I just
wanted to give my skin a bit of a clear
not wear no makeup today and yes I
thought I would just check in I don't
know when the last time I checked in was
I think you might have been the drone
footage by the night I've just wanted to
say hello I'm looking fabulous and
thought I didn't want to waste the
opportunity if you guys to see how
gorgeous they look tomorrow I might be
going to a few things with courier just
to see in like a few showrooms to see if
they've got any stuff for us for Fashion
Week

I'm hoping it's already bad otherwise
Friday's I did anyone else they're gonna
get it to me I just looked I hate winter
how I look into Intel so I woke up
feeling a little bit better but still
just not quite right quite right it's
definitely the change in weather it's a
little bit less sunny in Sydney but it's
getting very very chilly by the day and
I don't deal with changing of weather I
get very sick I get a lot of hay fever
I'm also allergic to my cat and Bambi
Nick wasn't over last night Bambi sat on
my bed and I think I make a conscious
effort never to flip my doing a cover
over the other way because it means
where she's lying on the end of the bed
will go all over my face and I think I
did that my god I woke up this morning
who I was so congested and it was like
really quite painful so I was a massive
WikiWiki area on my part but I mean II
hardly tell you sleeping Peter knew I
want him I then have a facial with all
sounds clinic I believe that just opened
up and they're getting for people to
sort of review it or try it out and I
saw Michelle's Instagram story yes I
think she went yesterday and it looks so
beautiful so I'm so excited for that I
don't feel like in winter I can't walk
around with a pale face I just I feel
like I wear a lot more makeup in winter
I've been watching Riverdale and up to
sort of episode five and I'm so obsessed
with it I love it oh my god these
Netflix original series are amazing I
love how there's only like one season
because I tend to get really sick of it
and I give up
so having one seasons the biggest heat
ever but I love it I've recently watched
the OJ Simpson that thing which I loved
and will Kingdom which is by far my
favorite TV show ever is strange strange
TV so but it's so cool and then has
watched Riverdale which I'm sort of
halfway through and I've watched 13
reasons why which I loved as well with
if I watched 13 reasons why and there
was like five seasons I was in like
so yeah those worn out I guess maybe and
then I now want them to bring out other
