you so much for watching today I filmed
this burgundy i looked and i filmed also
with that a combination of two different
lip colors if you like this makeup look
please keep watching so I've already
done my base I didn't use this hourglass
primer my NARS foundation and a
combination of this NARS in vanilla
concealer and Mac in NZ 30 concealer I
set it with these two shades from the AC
on to a highlighting kit and I did my
brows with this hourglass sculpting
pencil so taking this bareMinerals
five-in-one
eye primer I just put that all over my
lids and rub that in with my fingers
just to set my eyelids for my eyeshadows
so then once I've rubbed all that in I
set that with the highlighting shades
again from the same palette with this
Real Techniques foundation brush and I
go into my steal of palette and I start
off with this lighter shade here and I
just use it with a big fluffy brush from
Sigma as a transit a transition shade in
my crease this transition shade is an
important step because we're doing quite
a dramatic eye look you want to make
sure you set down this transition shade
just because it makes everything much
easier to blend when it comes to the
darker colors sorry as well if I say I'm
really sick I am have a really sore
throat so yeah bit croaky but yeah just
taking this brush just making sure
everything's blended out as best as it
can be and you just want to keep picking
up that color and just making it more
intense once you're happy with that take
this iron shade at the bottom of the
same palette and just run that in the
exact same spot as you put the
transition shade just warming up the eye
look on the same brush as well
so moving on to this shade now I'm
taking a denser brush and I'm just
running that through the crease as well
just keeping it more concentrated in the
crease instead of blending out as much
as the other colors so adding these
darker colors will allow us to slowly
make a gradient within our i shadow
make sure because that is a darker color
you're really blending that out as well
getting rid of all the harsh lines so
then moving upwards taking this brown on
a smaller brush running that through the
socket line
make sure with this I look you're just
constantly going back to your blending
brushes and blending it all out because
it can be very harsh because it's
getting darker and darker so just the
most important part of this I look it's
just honestly to blend it all out as
best you can
moving to the darkest shade that we'll
be using the deep purple we're running
it in the same spot just again deepening
the color
once you're happy with the intensity of
it all go back to your very first
blending brush and take a little bit of
the orange shade and just blend it all
out one final time then taking this
palette we are taking these two reddish
copper shades am i putting that on the
eyelid with our finger we're just
packing that on and then once you've
packed on enough you just take a little
bit more of the product on a flat brush
and you just blend it in with the crease
color and then just blend it all
together with your blending brush so on
a flat shader brush this one's from
Ecotools will be taking the dark brown
from the stealer palette and running
that all the way under our lash line
so now taking the orange shade room it's
still a pallet we're just gonna smoke
out our bottom lashline so that we
create consistency from the top of our
eyelids to the bottom then to draw it
all together we'll take the copper
reddish shade from the other pallet and
put that on the center of our lower lash
line so I'm using this false lash wings
from L'Oreal so just pack samskara onto
your lashes I will be applying some
false lashes so I'm just creating a base
for them nice platform for them to sit
on so do your top and bottom lashes
then I'm taking this Adel eyelash tool
and I'm just placing the red cherry 46
lashes in the middle of my eyelid then
I'm putting the outer corner in then I'm
taking a pair of tweezers and I'll just
clip the feet in a corner piece well
then using the tool just pushing the
eyelashes down towards your lashes and
then clamping them together with the
tool as well again on the other side you
just place it in the middle put the
outside corner in take a pair of
tweezers with the inner corner in and
then clamp your lashes to the falsies so
I'm then taking this black liner and I'm
just tight lining the upper lash line
and then I'm taking my Mac soft and
gentle as a highlight on my inner corner
just to brighten up the eye look
so moving on to the face I'm taking this
Smashbox photo filter cleaning powder
foundation and I've got this in credit
art shade so I'm using this just to warm
up the outer part of my face just the
transition shade for my contour so I'm
taking my Too Faced bronzer the
chocolate Soleil and I'm using this as
my contour shade so I'm just putting
that in all my contour spots pull the
cheekbones on the forehead underneath
the jaw line all that good stuff
then for my blush shade I'm using this
deep rosy red color from cabana boy from
the cabana boy blush from the balm and
it just goes well with the eye look
I usually wipe peachy shades on my
cheeks but this went well as a deeper
reddish color on the cheeks and then
from my highlight I'm also using the Mac
soft and gentle mineralized skinfinish
as my highlight on my face so on my
cheek above my cheekbones my forehead
down the bridge of my nose and my
Cupid's bow
then taking this Mac lip pencil in the
color well I'm just lining my lips
and then taking my favorite lipstick in
the whole world which is velvet teddy by
Mac I'm just putting that all over my
lips this is my idea of a nude I'm not
into the light foundation color nudes so
I feel like this is a really pretty
color that just gives a bit of life to
your lips and then taking that off I'll
just line my lips with the same lip
pencil I'll then take the second color
which is sin by Mac as well and it's
just a dark berry shade and I'll just
run that all over my lips too
so once you've put the lipstick on I
just go back in with my lipliner and I
just clean up any lines that may have
gone over because it is quite a dark
color it's hard to get neat results
every time so that's the finished look I
hope you guys have enjoyed this look
please give it a thumbs up if you did
and of course subscribe if you want to
see more videos from me I'll be
uploading every Tuesday and Friday
hopefully so yeah see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
