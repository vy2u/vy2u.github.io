would go grocery shop and get some spicy
hummus because I was like my favorite
snack Adama and get a few groceries and
I have some mail to pick up so that I'd
make it a little trip out I just feel
I'm having one of those weeks I'm really
really struggling because I just feel so
gross like I feel addict rubbish see
I've broken out all over my forehead and
like you guys saw in my last blog
probably but there's only a tragic
tragic time last vlog as well and it
just hasn't haven't quite snapped out of
it yet okay well it's hard for me to
vlog when I'm just doing like absolute
 but yeah I just thought I would
show you guys how I'm doing and bring
you guys along

the deluxe bronzing powder that I'm in
love with but I already have one so I'll
put it in a giveaway and I got a skin
tint which I'm so excited to try out

sneak peek at all the giveaway prizes

we're having sort of a Mexican themed
keep on choking on a cracker we're
having a Mexican themed night at Daisy's
house so I'm just going to go now I'm
wish they're wearing like pajamas but
she's making mosquitoes and we're having
tacos
hi guys so I'll just finished doing my
makeup I'm off to a Maybelline event
tonight splits my hair back I'm slowly
slowly going to dislike the slicked hair
I mean I love the cab on me um and then
some stones to dislike it and yeah so
it's currently like 4:45 I'm leaving at
5:20 to go picnic up and then we're
going to the event we're going to call
del bar I think and which is in the city
which looks really fun so I'm very keen
for tonight alrighty so this is my
outfit I'll show you guys a mirror shot
so this is what I'm wearing this little
bodysuit is from princess Polly I have
no idea where this score is from but I
think it might be misguided watch is
from Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs and by
Charlotte are the bracelets the bag is
why itself and my shoes are princess
Polly as well yes I've just ordered my
favorite
I'm so ready like every time I start
this vlog I'm just constantly telling
you guys I'm sweaty because it's
currently like 40 degrees in Sydney and
I just came back from Pilates so I'm
just like well so this is what I'm
wearing I've got my choker from princess
Polly this bikini from a shiny grimmons
white fox label and then I've got my
Malaya Serrano this is so tricky these
bottoms but anyway
hi guys I always feel like I need to
take sort of like half an hour break
after I've finished filming just to like
give myself a pat on the back and have a
rest
but usually I'm really used to slouching
and it's just slapping over whereas in
your videos like two hours straight
you're sitting up so you go straight
there so I get so tired that's all
problems this vlog has been pretty
boring I'm not going to lie I'm edited a
bit of it I'm not the biggest fan of it
how do you know I just haven't really
liked this week's vlog but hopefully if
you've made it this far you've enjoyed
it and I mean every week you're not
going to be the funnest of activities I
was trying to update you guys on oh yeah
I haven't been filming as much either
which is my cameras stuffing up it's
really slow like it takes like 30
seconds to turn on and off and when I'm
wanting to capture something in the
moment I can't really do it because my
camera takes so long so I'm thinking of
me I'm going to invest in this sony
a5100 there's quite a few youtubers that
use it for their blogging for their
vlogs and I just absolutely love how it
looks I love my canon g7x but I like
change so I think I want to change it up
I'll still have this one it's system so
I'll have the option for both just
filmed this video and we going up in
March I think so
it's when the new releases for the
Maybelline come out it's got they've got
such good stuff you guys are going to
love it when you see tomorrow is
Valentine's Day and I'll bring you guys
along so I'll end the vlog probably
tomorrow
and I'll bring you guys along with me
and Mickey going to let's go me and if
you're going to woolum low water so
that'll be really nice actually that'll
make the vlog good
so this morning oh yeah that's why I
picked up my camera actually forgot to
tell you guys yesterday we went through
a festival at the correct record wasn't
really festival as sort of like a DJ set
one day a one day thing and it was
called hot since 82 and it was so much
fun it's probably one of the funnest
days I've had in
time I didn't forget it Olli that and if
I didn't look yesterday so embarrassing
Polly jumped up on my back and like I
would like to carry her out on my back
and then she got - she's like okay jump
on me maybe old ppl yeah like Brendan
jumped so high on her back she lost her
balance immediately we both fell
directly backwards and I landed it
straight on my tailbone and it wasn't
even on the grass I'm pretty sure it was
like on the concrete like on the ground
it was so painful I woke up this morning
I was like stiff stiff as hell like I
couldn't move and it was in front of a
lot of people as well a lot of people
saw that was really really humiliating I
met a lot of you yesterday which was
really nice as well I loved meeting you
guys and I love when you cop and say hi
um okay so what else pesto guys yeah so
I suppose for the rest of this afternoon
I'm going to be editing my maybelline
video and I have quite a few instagrams
that I have to put up which um I'm a bit
behind on so maybe you have to take some
Instagram photos and I'll just sort of
reply to emails and get myself organized
for the week because it is Monday it's
Monday today and yeah I had Pilate had
to cancel cloudy today because of my
tailbone and I'm probably have to cancel
for the next few days as well which is
so annoying because I got I'm in such a
roll and I love it so much so I will
check in with you guys when something
interesting is happening happy
Valentine's Day
so unfortunately Valentine's Day has
taken a bit of a turn for the worst I'll
show you what I mean it's pouring with
rain outside and it's really cold but
we're still going to go for lunch it'll
be really nice down at the wharf
hopefully and apparently the rain is
supposed to be clearing in probably an
hour hopefully it will clear up and
we'll have a nice not necessarily Sun
but nice and dry weather yes I'll just
bring you guys along to lunch and then
tonight we've got tickets for 50 shades
darker so we're
we're going to guys say that maybe I'm
really excited I love I love Christ
you
can't come to a surprise 6 rises
alrighty
so we're just we're just finished up in
the movies
nothing pre-pre Monte's if you like it
don't like it yeah yeah a little bit
what about that like you're gonna just
what hon yeah last night so now is this
constant mechanism of hard drive sir so
we're going to end on time with that big
matching bed sorry gross
