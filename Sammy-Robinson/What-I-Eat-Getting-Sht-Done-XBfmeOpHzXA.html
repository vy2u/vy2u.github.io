I'm just uploading the vlog aadmi moving
home
but of me moving house and I was hoping
to set my New York 1 live tonight but I
think I'm gonna have to do that tomorrow
so I think I might do two videos in a
row but yeah so I'm just chilling out my
have dinner with the family tonight and
then I'll head back
I got a SMS confirmation that my
internet is finally gonna be able to go
my life I guess it's gonna work so I
have to go home and figure out how to
set that up as well and I'm keen to get
back into uploading two videos a week
hopefully
I'm really hoping fingers crossed this
Internet's gonna work imagine if I went
through all of this with this stupid
internet company and it didn't even work
I'm sure I would all righty so now I'm
going to attempt by myself
to put my internet modem together
apparently it's pretty simple but let's
just type it out electrocute myself wish
me luck
hey she's done it okay it is dinner time
I'm gonna make myself some dinner don't
know what I want I think I want to make
myself a pizza if you guys follow me on
my social so basically I had a meeting
with two girls from equation I don't
know if you guys have seen it um I'll
link it down below so they've created a
few meal plans for me I've taken a few
of their recipes from their stuff they
are really awesome if you guys are binge
eaters or overeat or need help need food
plans I'll link them down below they're
really good but I'm basically the two
meals that I've taken from them on my
oats with peanut butter and blueberries
every morning and for dinner
I do love making pizzas it's been my
favorite thing I'll tell you guys more
about that I'm sure I don't know the
stage but for now let's make something
so my absolute favorite thing to do
right now is roast up capsicum I just
cut all of it off and put it into the
oven and the same goes for sweet
potatoes I'm gonna do that with my sweet
potato like so I just cut it all up like
this and I'm gonna put it on a tray and
bake it so these are my ingredients I'm
gonna put tomato obviously the capsicum
chicken mushrooms spinach some fresh
basil pesto onion some ham on this wrap
and then this is gonna be my pizza base
sauce and then because I like barbecue
sauces why I just put this over the top
now I'm just gonna
tada
dee-licious so now I'm gonna sit at my
office do a bit of editing and eat my
meat oh this is literally oh my dog
apparently the most delicious things I
have ever tried I think I prefer this
one they've got an everyday basis
because it's not as intense but this one
oh my god it's like pretzels and
chocolate and it'll literally the yogurt
tastes like caramel it's insane so this
is essentially what it is it's a thing
of yogurt and then on this side it's got
chocolate and caramelized almonds good
morning my love's
it is Wednesday morning and I'm about to
go off and get these eyelashes redone
and I'm gonna go get some laser I
haven't had laser in like six months so
I'm keen to do that again laser
legitimately works like I've been
hairless but it's kind of like a
maintenance thing so that it doesn't
come back you know and then tonight I've
got netball and I know you guys hate me
hate me telling you what I'm about to do
when I don't show you but for all those
things I kind of can't film like I'm not
gonna throw my laser eyelashes my eyes
are closed I'm probably not gonna film
that like I just sit there sleeping but
I will show you before and after that's
kind of the purpose of why I've started
this vlog I'm just gonna make some
brekkie now I have I'm gonna have some
peanut butter toast with banana on it
and I might go get myself a coffee
today's outfit is this offend singlet
from princess Polly these vintage jeans
which I've been wearing so much of and
I'm sorry that I can't like tell you
guys where they're from because I got
them from Vinnie's like years ago I just
love them they're so comfy
they were pretty uh baggy and they're
not that that's just seriously spank
myself oh sorry about that
and then I'm wearing my
I confess the black ones at the white
sandals what straps no laces laces I
already had half of this banana this
morning before I went to the gym so I'm
gonna have one more slice of bread this
banana and some peanut butter I'm on
that peanut butter grind what dreams are
made of all right that's good it's a
beautiful day peanut butter toast what
is like what white why is it so magical
I got my shades on
excuse me rude block out the haters
like oh man okay myself in lunch but
most importantly okay so I can probably
show you these my eyelashes I look a bit
sleepy at my eyes they're a little bit
red because well I was lying down boys
and how up pretty much sleeping but it's
like the weirdest thing getting your
eyelashes done because I can't sleep I
physically cannot sleep because I said
there's someone touching my eyes all
time and I'm so uncomfortable but like I
don't know I don't know how I don't take
myself insane so I just stopped at a
cafe and I got this breakfast bowl thing
it's got poached eggs salmon big things
of falafel in there
heaps of pesto roast tomato and tahini
dressing yummy and all the Fluffles
underneath oh my gosh looks so good
and of course of course my coffee
I love how today it started off with me
being like oh my god it's the beautiful
day outside and now it's like and then
we'll then it's flooded like you guys
saw it flooded and then now it's kind of
like looks to see if it's gonna get
sunny again what the hell have a food
baby from lunch but I say something oh
yeah you guys are wondering I always
forget to tell you I get my lashes done
at delicious so there you go I wonder if
netball is gonna be cancelled today
surely it's gonna be wet
hopefully not though I really want to
play
I'm gonna film my favorites video now
and I will talk to you guys afterwards
Chad what I ended up filming a get ready
with me on this makeup look
not like eye makeup tutorial but just
like a chitchat get ready with me for my
favorites video because I thought why
not just show you guys some of my
favorite acts and then I filmed my
favorites video so two videos under my
belt I've got another vlog before this
one and now I've got this vlog I'm
feeling good I've got 4 uploads
I'm gonna upload 2 next week to the
following week get back to this - awake
business tonight
I've got Korea's launch party for her
princess Polly arrange it's getting so
close to Christmas it's actually making
me so happy and excited every radio
channel that started playing Christmas
Carol but that's just I want to put
lights up I went in bought batteries
yesterday for all my indoor and outdoor
lights so another one of my equal ocean
meals or English a coalition inspired
meals is oats and I've got about a cup
of oats in here I've mixed my body
protein and my true peak of protein
through it with almond milk and then
I've got I've melted peanut butter all
over the top with blueberries and this
is like my favorite breakfast at the
moment and it literally tastes like
chocolate pudding because the oats are
so chocolatey from the protein powder so
I thought I would just gotta just do a
little bit more of an explanation of
equation because I didn't really explain
it properly you might you if you follow
Chloe's app you would probably have seen
that she's sort of who I found them
through and then they sort of got in
contact with me and then we met up and
they explained everything to me so I
thought I'd just like explain it a
little bit more properly it's an amazing
service for people that are binge eaters
or people that over indulge or people
that don't necessarily know their macros
and how to eat and get a bit confused by
food maybe so they basically use their
own science-based formula to work out
your carbs proteins fats and like all
your macros which I didn't know so I
didn't know I definitely didn't know
they give you these intake goals weekly
and like make food plans around that and
like I said I don't really stick to the
food plans because
I suck at it one with my job it's kind
of hard because I go out for meetings
not for breakfast and two I generally
just like doing that so I like going out
and having lunch with friends and my
family and going out for dinner and
drinks but the cool thing about them is
that you actually can do that like they
just give you ideas sort of and if you
want and if you do do the program you
can ask them like what do you think is
good and make suggestions around that as
well
I don't really know enough about it so
they have so many articles about it so
you guys can if you're just intrigued go
on to that Facebook page or the
Instagram page for me it was more I was
really struggling to find tone and
muscle definition in my body so like I
was constantly quite bloated and I don't
know like it just I was working really
really hard and when you're working
really hard in the gym and you're not
seeing results it's kind of frustrating
try using the compas body composition
like suggestions that they gave me I've
really upped my protein and I've started
things results so quickly like like even
in my shoulders and like I've got like
look at my muscles I've just it's really
helped tone my body because I've been
eating sort of the right things for me
and they're the whole thing that I love
about them is all about balance so you
know you find a lot of fad diets out
there that are just so hard to stick by
like you can't really stick by them
whereas with them the main thing is
eating a lot of Whole Foods veggies
really good things for you but then also
treating yourself so having a little
dessert every night is so important
because then you won't find that you
binge I might read you one of my meal
plans just like so you guys get an idea
of it but don't take this necessarily as
your own because I'm a very tall girl
this is the macros that they've
formulated for me so I'm just giving you
an idea of me and yours would probably
be different but for example I've got a
very smoothie with strawberries
blueberries honey and protein powder
breakfast and I've got a commons protein
bar and a coffee for a snack got a
chicken hummus wrap with lettuce tomato
multigrain wrap with Nando's pyrénées
or like mayonnaise for lunch for my next
snack I've got a yo Pro yogurt
a Chavo name as a meze dip and some
sunrise mini bite crackers with the dip
and then for dinner I've got a bit like
a pokeball made pokeball so rice carrot
avocados spring onions corn fountain soy
and honey sauce with salmon and then for
meal six I've got Nana's waffles with
peanut butter I don't know what nano
nanos waffles out but I haven't done
this plan yet but this is the new one
that they sent me really majority
healthy stuff and then like a little
treat here and there so that I don't
feel like I get to 10 p.m. night and I'm
like oh my god I want to eat heaps in
here as well he's because I've sort of
eaten like exciting things all
throughout the day see yes that is a
little bit more about them I just wanted
to come in here and tell you guys about
that because yeah I kind of briefly
touched on it and didn't really explain
it so I'll leave that links and
everything down below if you guys just
want to go have a read and have a look
at the way that they work it's very
interesting hello it's me again I just
didn't want to add in to the thing about
