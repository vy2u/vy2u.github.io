start another vlog I honestly have no
idea what this blog is gonna be I
haven't really thought this through but
um I've quite a few videos I have to
film this week and events that I'm going
to so I want to make sure I'm pumping up
content for you guys see the lawnmower
has started okay so it's basically right
now I'm gonna go pick up my car it's
been in service for the last week I'm
struggling me there so I'm gonna pick
that up have lunch with Nick on the way
home then come home and film a video and
then I've got an event tonight with
Coach so I'll bring you guys along to
that and we'll see what else the week
brings us so this is today's outfit
we've got a little nude singlet which
I've no idea where it's from I'll link
it down below if I can find it this
little skirt is princess Polly and then
I've got my white sneakers and my
ray-bans I'm wearing very minimal
bronzer and highlight but I love someone
when you just don't have to wear makeup
it's the best feeling ever so I'm just
waiting in the car mum's gone to get
herself a coffee because she's dropping
me the gem so yes I I'll pick up my cog
I have lunch with Nick and then go home
and the video I'm gonna film is my
Maybelline GG collection I'm gonna add
it I've decided into my New York vlog
because I was watching the footage and I
was showing little bits and pieces of
the makeup but then I realized that's
probably like so frustrating for you
guys you probably actually want to see
how they makeup performs and I even want
to see how it performs as well I've used
a few few of the things I haven't had a
chance to use like a full face of it so
I think that that would just be super
interesting for you guys to see because
it's coming to Sydney on like the 9th of
December or something so I'll try and
get that up before then so that you guys
can see my reviews and yeah see what I
think I do know from swatching it's
amazing I've also used a few of the
products when I was there I used like
the bronzy eyeshadow palette the red lip
and stuff and through orangey red lip is
amazing but yeah that's what I'm gonna
do when I get home put that into my New
York log and hopefully get that up soon
I'm just also waiting on the footage
from the videographer he
some really cool footage while we were
there and I want to put some of that
into so that it's a really nice blog for
you guys to watch so hopefully he'll get
that to me soon and I can put it in
because I really just want to get it up
so you guys can see what we got up to
and then I've just got a whole bunch of
organizing to do I've got to put heaps
of products that I got sent in piles and
put them away I have no motivation to
put stuff away anymore because of this I
want it because I want to move out I
just I know I'm gonna be packing it all
up when I get a place and not to say
that I'll get a place now I might get a
place in like three months but I can't
live in my mess and I can't live in my
rubbish so it's like this constant
battle of but I could move out next week
sorry my camera just ran out of space
but as I was saying it's this constant
battle of I don't want to live in my
rubbish and mess but also like what if I
move out next week and I have to pack it
all up anyway so I've been a bit of a
grub lately and I need to go home and
clean all that up but I won't have too
much time to do that because then at
around 5:30 I'll be leaving for a coach
event so I've got an event at lo fight
which is so funny loafers like where we
went out for ages in Sydney and it's
where they're holding the event exciting
times exciting turns also tomorrow I'm
going to be filming a video with my new
sports girls stuff and this is probably
the most exciting one that I've done
because you guys know I love sports girl
I've used it for so long it's so
underrated and it's just a really
affordable price and super super good
I've been wearing them just like an egg
on a daily basis of his mum and they're
really good
let's go see the other baby
yeah yeah anyway I'll have a bit more of
the watch that tomorrow I obviously got
the open tomorrow and we're gonna see
the chapter on a PDA all right let's get
back to everybody so I'll give you
photos and some chicken
Wow I'm really sorry guys
I rush last night I can put it wrote
that I was slugging and didn't bring you
guys along to the event I had one too
many champagnes last night and I'm
feeling a little bit rusty I'm about to
start filming my sports go video I might
make some breakfast first actually maybe
some oats some porridge but yeah I'm
really disappointed last night was a
really good event and I wish I brought
you guys long so I'm tired very tired
my life is mess I might be going to look
at houses today no they still might
gonna have breakfast hungry yet though
I've got such a bad headache anyways I'm
gonna film now Wow world's worst Walker
already forgot to show you her breakfast
which actually looks disgusting but it's
so yummy so I've just got oats mixed
with my protein in here I've got peanut
butter melted on top and then some mango
looks disgusting but tastes delicious
okay so I just finished filming my
Sportsgirl video that will probably be
going up soon I'd say I don't think it
will be up yet I'm not very good with my
video timelines right now but yes it's
just this really summery peachy glowy
look which I love I've been wearing it
like every day so I'm probably actually
gonna do a little bit of editing then go
off to the gym I'm not gonna go to the
open houses today I've decided I just
don't have time it's gonna be way too
rushed so I can get a little bit of
editing done today which is also this
look is gonna just like consist of me
literally just like sitting here being
like sorry I didn't vlog again I just
had a shower wash my hair
I'm going to get it put up in a high bun
for tonight but it was so dirty from the
gym that I was like that's like I'm fair
if I make them put my hair up but it's
like police wait you so hopefully it'll
dry before I get there and it won't be
too hard to work with because I do know
that hairdressers like to have your hair
like a day old like dirty but so don't
know what I'm wearing I haven't been to
Holly's yeah I'm about to go but she's
not answering her phone and she was at
work I'm like I'm just trusting that
this is dress is gonna fit me and if it
doesn't I'm screwed so anyways that is
the plan about to Holly's if she answers
try on the dress and I'm gonna go
straight to get my hair done
haven't even had time to do much editing
today like I've imported all my footage
and went I had to go to the gym so I got
home showered then myself watch guys as
well by the way I said no because it's
just sitting here mekka sent me this
deep sleep pillow spray from this works
oh this stuff is amazing all you do is
you just spray a few sprays on your
pillow
it smells like love and up and it just
is so relaxing it's put me to sleep
straight away the last three nights that
I've used it so I really like that if
you guys have struggle if you guys
struggle with sleeping and need
something that's really relaxing
this works has this and then you will
they also have this thing that you put
on your pulse just like it calms you
down random side note anyways so Jim was
good I'm a bit slow in the gym after I
got back from New York I always am
release after I don't do it for a while
but I just do a bit of growing and some
squats Beauty games do you like a little
bit of it get ready with me for you guys
when I start getting ready laid up I
also am NOT going with anyone so I don't
know like when people will be there and
I don't know who's going on except
recive I hate that but okay I'm gonna
call try calling Holly again it's 2:30
now for reference by the way so I've got
to go to my hairdresser in like 15
minutes
she just called me and now she's not
gonna answer hey holes oh good okay
