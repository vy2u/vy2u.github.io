to be a what I packed on medication I
just emptied my suitcase which is right
next to me and folded it into piles here
I've got my makeup bag and all the
clothes I wore when I was in Bali so I
guess this is kind of a whole / mini
makeup tutorial so it would be
interesting for you guys to say what
makeup my take when I do go on a hot
sunny vacation where I don't really want
to wear anything and then I thought I
would do a little bit of a try on like a
mini haul as well and all the items from
princess Polly you got it I'm obsessed I
never let's move on I feel like I'm
looking super super white in this
lighting which is really strange because
I feel tanned from my holiday but I
don't think that I am I'm gonna start
off with the makeup this is the makeup
that I wear when I go on vacation and I
don't really wanna wear anything so as
you guys know skincare is super
important to me right now so especially
in Bali when I felt like I was getting a
little bit sunburned and my skin was
feeling SuperDuper dry I was
moisturizing like a crazy woman so I
always started with my Clarins double
serum serum and this is just full of
antioxidants and lots of natural
ingredients I went to their event and
they told me that there was tumeric and
there's so many different fruits and
veggies and plants and minerals and you
guys know I'm obsessed with that stuff
feels amazing it feels like silk on the
skin I use this every morning and then I
use my transform transforming serum at
nighttime but I like this before makeup
cuz it's like it feels a little bit more
moisturizing as opposed to like sticky
serum and then I would even with my
sheer transformation that wash doesn't
came from Olay Henriksen basically
moisturize the cur up out of my face and
then this is sort of like a new addition
to my routine which I was just doing
everyday in Bali Bey took my Mecca
cosmetic ax super spray SPF 50 UVA
protection comes out like a lightning
bolt I'm just like spread it over my
face if you like what I'm wearing is so
appropriate for this holiday vacation
I'm gonna change my car so I went in
everyday instead of a foundation I went
in with my estee lauder double wear
radiant bronze cushion stick I've showed
you guys this in a video before I think
so I guess I just kind of skipped
foundation
I took my it cosmetics heavenly luxe
foundation brush and just blend that
into my skin because I know a lot of you
guys would be the same often your body
tends to be a lot darker than your face
so I guess the point of this was just to
make sure I evened out my chest to my
face
but I am well aware that my chest
actually does not look at that tan at
the moment I don't know what goes on
with my lighting that's kind of the
downfall of using natural I think he
kept really different results every time
and then I did go in with concealer just
to make it a little bit more full
coverage without having to use
foundation so the concealer that I took
over was the master conceal by
Maybelline and this stuff is amazing
it's so underrated a super full coverage
I'm just so light and then whatever I
had left I use under my nose and on my
chin just got rid of the darkness under
my eyes and then the veins on the top of
my eyelids eyelids so after the
concealer I then went in with the cream
highlighter I used the Charlotte Tilbury
Hollywood Beauty light wand this stuff
is amazing it's super blinding but there
is definitely a packaging floor because
the concept is that you squeeze this and
the highlight comes at the top but when
that's in a case full of makeup
everything is obviously squeezing
against it I've got like a full lid full
of the product and it's just everywhere
so I mean it's a beautiful product but
it's it's just it goes everywhere
you can see that really glossy highlight
but then afterwards for blush I went in
with my Clinique pop oil cheek pop-pop
cheek cheek pop-pop oil pop oil which is
like a lip and cheek tint and this is in
the shade rose glow and this is like my
favorite quick cream blush but yeah it's
just super natural and beautiful and
again adds to that really glossy look
super pigmented lasts ages I've used
this for so long now for brows I took my
gimme brow by benefit in the shade
number three and I just basically
brushed all my brows upwards so finally
for lips I took the Charlotte Tilbury
lip shade and iconic nude this is one of
my favorite lip liners I took one of the
hourglass believer lipsticks the new
lipsticks that came out and this one is
in the shade girl or maybe it's the girl
lipsticks and it's in the shade believer
I love my liquid lipsticks but in Bali I
just couldn't be bothered they were not
as comfortable having dry lips so I've
been taking the Dior lip Maximizer in
0:02 so maybe one to two body products
that I brought over this is the bondo
sands SPF 30 and the one day scent
everyday liquid gold if I'm being
completely honest I didn't really use
this because I was sort of just tanning
naturally anyway over there so I didn't
really find myself grabbing the gradual
tanner but I did use this pretty much
every single day
it's the SPF 30 coconut beach of
sunscreen oil and those are both from
princess Polly so everything that I'm
showing you now is from princess Polly
before Mallya contacted the girls at
princess Polly and I was like please can
I have a few things going on vacation
and it was me and Nick's first ever
vacation together we've never been away
together we've been to foster and party
but they're still Australia we hadn't
been on a plane together and I wanted
you know I wanted to spruce up my
wardrobe a little bit with some really
cute summer essentials so I want to show
you guys in this video because they are
some of the cutest clothes and I'll run
through them pretty quickly just so that
it's not too long like a whole kynos
videos
already gonna be pretty long but I'll
insert clips of how I wore them in Bali
and the outfits that I put together and
everything will be listed down in the
description box if you want to find them
and as always I have a princess Polly
discount code for you guys I think it's
sr20 but I will double check that and
put it down below and it'll be on the
screen for you guys and I'm pretty sure
gets you 20% off I can't remember but
regardless he'll be just here I thought
I would show you the glasses that I
brought over to Bali I brought over
these Kylie Jenner glasses by key which
is obviously on Princess Polly
um these are just the octagon sort of
fake ray-ban ones and there was super
lightweight super easy to keep in my bag
like they looked like they're like paper
they're so easy to take anywhere you
probably would be surprised with the
colors that I chose but you might be a
bit like just really like how much did
you need of that color I brought pretty
much everything in mustard and yellow it
just it was just calling to me on the
side and everything I had yellow and I
was like I need that I need that I need
that for me summer is yellow for me
summer is Sun last thing I bought with
this little polka dot dress this one I
wore to dinner I don't think I posted or
showed you guys a photo but it's super
cute really summery super girly the
polka dots
I don't know this dress just screams
summer to me like this is summer
this dress is summer so yes I was into I
guess you could say as well really
vintage vibe is a superb into jeez but
um so I guess because I'm wearing at the
top of it I'll show you the little skirt
it got sore legs first day back the chin
goes oh what love and lemons and it's
got lemons on it this was the first
thing that I picked because I thought it
was stunning firstly I just think the
top is so flattering
I just think really thin straps are
super flattering a little bow really
pretty the skirt was a really nice
length I'm really tall and scats usually
ride straight up my bum holes little
frills at the bottom and the lemons and
it's just so vibrant and super
comfortable next following the yellow
mustard family this is the here's a
little two-piece this was in my vlog
yes on my blog it was the first outfit
that I wore this skirt is pretty short
on me but um I love it then with white
sneakers or sandals and it's just so
flattering another recurring theme of
the outfits was that I liked a lot of
them to be off the shoulder I'm really
into off the shoulder at the moment and
what I'm vibing so this little dress
this one's so cute again oh my god it
just reminds me of like what I used to
wear when I was like a child a baby but
like now I'm an old version of it and
it's like not it's not girly and baby
like but it's almost like the adult
version of it so it's super cute still
kind of sexy like you feel really sexy
in these short little flowy dresses a
little thrill at the bottom of the dress
and I like that it's been act search
shows little bit of your deck guitar
yeah the main point of most of these
outfits was just that they were easy
easy breezy beautiful egg stop again
with the vintage vibes I got this little
skirt which is actually scored there's
like little shorts underneath but it's a
scale like it doesn't look like shorts
and I wore this with a little white
t-shirt it's like sneakers but this one
checkered vintage love the color love
the earthy vibes and this was a big wide
brimmed hat looks so beautiful
hmm next up I bought a pair of shorts I
thought I'd wear these like every day
with all my little off the shoulder tops
but I actually didn't wear them that
much because I like to wear little play
suits and dresses but these are super
cool really flattering I love the wash
of them they're really short but not too
short they're really tight but not too
tight I could probably have gone for a
size bigger but that's okay just I think
that they're just kind of like the
perfect high-waisted denim shorts to be
honest
alright guys moving on to my tops don't
judge me I got quite a few I bought kind
of quite a lot of them so let's run
through these quickly I'm gonna wear
them all just with the denim shorts so
that you can guide you guys can see them
so first off we have this little number
you have this little off the shoulder
striking a red long-sleeved top I liked
the frills at the top of it I like that
it wasn't too tight around my arms
maybe the fat kind of bold at the top
which I do get with some of the shoulder
tops and I just loved the color I
actually plan on wearing this with an
orangey red lipstick and I didn't bring
one so I didn't wear it next I didn't
wear this but still it's super super
cute I got this little off the shoulder
one as well meet Ruth I just thought
that the stripes were really cool and I
thought it was really summery again yeah
I just liked the colors and the stripes
I thought it was quite different like I
hadn't really seen anything like that so
I picked that one up too and I mean
contributing factor was because it was
off the shelf next this one's got to be
one of my faves it's so easy and
lightweight and goes with everything
it's this little off the shoulder
t-shirt I know I'm gonna be wearing this
one every day in summer because it just
is super lightweight it's got a really
nice cute sort of roughly fabric and
it's just still just go with anything
while I remember because I know I'm
gonna forget my jumpsuit overall done
great thing is in the wash I want every
Tuesday in Bali in the morning when we
would just walk to get breakfast or
something before I got ready for the day
it is the most comfortable thing I have
ever worn in my entire life like
honestly it's so comfortable so if you
guys looking for a really loose
comfortable just play suit that you can
chuck on every day and summer you have
got to invest in this one next I got one
of these tops that everyone is wearing I
actually didn't wear this one but um I
wore this in red in Bali you guys might
have seen it's like one of those tops
that are going around that everyone is
wearing it the way that I thought I
would jump on the bandwagon just because
it's really cool and I love
off-the-shoulder things if you can't
tell next I got this really cute t-shirt
I didn't wear this one either but I
definitely wanted to show you guys
because how beautiful those Rose is such
a nice little white t-shirt I love plain
white things that just have like a
simple accent to it so it's not plain
anymore some ripped up denim like really
baggy denim jeans or shorts with this
and like some cat eye glasses I love it
and slick has always because when do I
not slick hair also got the blue or
black cat tail maybe Navy or black think
it's black off-the-shoulder version of
the red one that I showed you guys
I haven't taken the tag off either
because I didn't get the chance to wear
it but I know I'm gonna wear it like
look I just love the shape of these tops
and I actually don't have very many long
sleeves so I liked the fact that they
were long-sleeve yeah I got this
gorgeous top it's so soft and comfy I
love this one it's very different if you
can wear it kind of off the shoulder but
still kind of goes up here like it's a
singlet but it's it's not too sure it's
not a singlet of the dusty rose color
and the little frills and the fabric is
just it's just so beautiful again very
vintage here and then again again super
vintage II like that this is what I mean
like it's crazy I bought this off the
shoulder cute like puffy singlet t-shirt
thing where it has ties that you can tie
it around the waist so that it's not too
baggy and loose super cool slicked hair
into some denim shirt and your white
sneakers I feel like because I haven't
sat down come do this how long I've been
losing my voice but other than that that
is the end of this video I really hope
that you guys enjoyed it I've missed you
and I'm so happy to be back and filming
