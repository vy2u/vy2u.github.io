morning I'm actually just ready to go
off to the gym if you've been following
me on Instagram you would know that I've
been sort of updating my Instagram
stories with all the stuff that I've
been doing with my trainer Ben but I
thought today I would bring my camera
along and vlog it for you guys so we do
two half hour sessions every week and
it's mostly sort of strengths I think
well you'll see I don't even know what
it's called and yes I want to start
bringing you guys along occasionally and
if you guys like what you see today then
make sure you do follow me on instagram
because i update that a little bit more
often so with that being said I'm gonna
go now I also have booked myself into an
infrared sauna session afterwards I hope
I'd be cool to bring you guys along to
help let's do it so since I've moved
houses I've been training at
just since I've moved houses I've been
training at Flo athletic and I just have
like the normal membership and do all
the normal classes that's really good
also side note I've got like a really
swollen earlobe and it's a really
swollen

and reps yeah absolutely killed me boys
I'll leave his links down below to his
instagram as well as like the website
flaw but if you guys are interested
another puppy thing
so this is what the infrared sauna looks
like just in there and you press on and
you get to watch Netflix everything so
that's cool
I bought myself a lot of string because
you definitely need to stay very
hydrated okay so I'm just finished up in
the sauna hmm have such a love-hate
relationship with this sauna because
it's like the most it's just like so hot
overwhelming disgusting but then after
when I walk out I always feel really
good healthy moaning heaven oh my
goodness I wish I realized I forgot to
show you guys my breakfast this morning
I just had muesli yoghurt berries honey
and then I had just like some tea and
then I just got myself a coffee first
snack a coffee a day I love these common
protein bars it's like a great style
yoga I'm very Pro Teen Vogue onz thought
it was like just before lunch
I can never hold through to us no but
anyways I'm gonna head home now and get
ready I'm having shower and scrub my
face scrub my body and put some makeup
on because then I have a really cool
opportunity with the project going into
their studio and filming a little
segment for them I'm not gonna be on the
project itself like sitting at like the
table doing a segment on bullying and
they're getting a whole bunch of
influences together to do like a little
one line thing each you know those
celebrity videos that are like I can't
think of one off the top of my head but
like they all have like the one-liners
I'm assuming it's gonna be something
like that
although I'm not a celebrity and I'm
very flattered that they wanted me I am
so down for the cause bullying is
disgusting I don't understand what any
one ever feels the need to bully another
person with a very small year group and
there was where everyone was sort of
friends of everyone or at least I
thought I was I just yeah I had a really
really really nice group of girls that I
went to school with so I haven't
personally experienced bullying but I
think it's disgusting
it breaks my heart it makes me sick so
I'm so excited to be part of this video
and I think it's showing on the project
so I'm not gonna be on the project but I
think the video is being shown on the
project I'm
come and get ready for that yeah it's
also just met two lovely girls that said
they were from Denmark I think they said
they were from Denmark but they just
walked past me and so that was in the
coffee shop but biggest sweatiest
grossest mess right now after this order
so I was like oh sorry but they were
lovely
so if you guys are watching enjoy the
rest of your trip I hope you guys are
having a lovely time in Australia I'm
good so I'll see you guys at home okay
so I'm ready to go I just put a few cows
through my hair just did a really basic
makeup look as I always do and I mean my
princess Polly stuff and you know I'm
gonna go now I'll probably bring my
camera in but I don't really know what
I'll be allowed to film need to memorise
my line as well I've got like one one
job one line right here and I'm just
about to say my segment so here's the
behind the scenes there's me hello
so if you see someone being bullied
speak up even if your voice shakes so if
you see someone being bullied speak up
even if your voice shakes and if you see
someone speaking up for someone else
support them even if your voice shakes
I'm good okay so I've just made myself
some tuna noodle thing so random I know
umm and I'm just gonna get to editing
now so I've got my maybelline video to
edit just use my estee lauder one just

poly hole
