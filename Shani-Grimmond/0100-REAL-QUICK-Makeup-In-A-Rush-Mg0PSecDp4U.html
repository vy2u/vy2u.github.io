doing a really quick and easy and makeup
tutorial for when you are running late
or if you just don't like to wear much
makeup at all I mean this is still a lot
of makeup it's not something that's like
a no makeup makeup look it's still very
glamorous but something that you can do
it very quickly so I hope you guys like
this video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already
because I upload all the time and let's
go ahead and get started okay so the
first step I'm doing is going in with
the Smashbox photo finish primer water
this takes literally two seconds ready
okay maybe five because I put so many on
my face but this is the quickest way to
prime your face and it feels so
incredibly refreshing it's going to wake
you up now it's time for foundation so
if you're in a rush make sure you use a
foundation that you know it works for
your skin because it's no time to
experiment when you're in rush so the
one that I've been obsessed with is the
L'Oreal infallible
24 hour matte foundation I'm in the
shade 24 golden beige I bought this not
too long ago I've only used it a few
times but like it's one of those
foundations where I just like fell in
love instantly I'm just going to buff
this into my skin the thing that I love
about this is it's really easy to blend
out and it also has amazing coverage so
after I've taken this in circular
motions on my face I unlike to stipple
it in to make sure there's no
brushstrokes and then I also like to
brush any foundation into my hairline if
you do have platinum blonde hair good
luck with that one I'm also going to
blend this down my neck a little bit
then for concealer I'm taking my
Smashbox to your skin in the shade light
neutral so the reason I'm using a really
light concealer is because it's going to
give a really nice highlighted effect
under the eyes and it just makes you
look so awake and like you put effort in
I mean come on oh yeah like I'm a ball
so under my eyes down the center of my
head went center of my brows down my
nose and on my chin I thought I'm so
scared right now
now taking my Beauty Blender under my
eyes and just bouncing this until it all
blends in the Beauty Blender is a must
if you don't have this original pink
Beauty Blender you need to get it right
now now with whatever's left on my
Beauty Blender I'm just
go over my eyelid because I have so many
veins on my eyelid is insane and then to
set under my eyes I'm going in with a
really pale powder my concealer is
creasing already it's been literally 2
seconds this is the Mac Pro emphasized
I'm also going to run this over my
eyelids as well to set that concealer on
there and then for the rest of my face
I'm taking the Australis fresh and
flawless powder I'm just gonna dab this
on my face with a really big stippling
brush the bigger the brush look weaker
this is just going to make sure all of
the like bronzers and stuff blend out
really easily because if you put bronzer
and blush over a wet product like a wet
foundation it gets sorry patchy so this
step is definitely optional but I'm just
going to quickly take a bit of brow
powder through my brows just because
I've accidentally put like foundation
all through them so they're looking a
bit ashy
I'm just going to fill in any sparse
areas if you don't want to fill in your
brows you can definitely just put like
an eyebrow gel through there maybe like
a colored one to add a little bit of
color to them and to make them more
texturized if that's what you'd prefer
the brows on now I'm going to go in and
curl my lashes this literally makes the
biggest difference if you guys don't
have an eyelash curler I'm pretty sure
you can get them from like Target or
Kmart for like 5 bucks or something I
definitely think they're worth it it's
like they grow 20 meters like oh my god
I didn't even know my lashes existed now
they're massive for mascara I'm taking
the Too Faced better than sex this is
amazing because it's really wet so the
lashes just get coated super quickly and
they get long in two seconds so what I
like to do is start from the bottom of
my lashes and just take it in zigzag
motion so it gets every single lash then
I'm going back in with that eyelash
curler and curling my lashes with
mascara on just a warning apparently
your lashes can literally snap off doing
this so not recommending it just saying
that oh god it's stuck oh my god but you
have to wait to the mascaras dry
then going in with a bit of bronzer to
add some color to the face this is the
betty lou manizer by the balm this is a
very shimmery bronzer I love it so much
I'm just going to put this under my
cheekbones and I'm also just going to
use this as blush so I'm going to put it
on the apples of my cheeks as well just
so we have a nice sunkissed glow and
don't forget to do around at the
forehead off that glory
I'm dilly dilly done now it's time to
highlight because even if you have ten
minutes to get ready you have time to
pull out a highlighter palette well I
mean I do I'm using this NARS albatross
highlighter right here it is absolutely
stunning
sorry pigmented look at that I'm also
just going to put this on at the tip of
my nose as well so obviously if you're
running late you want to stay clear of
any dark colors because if you stuff up
because you're in a rush it's going to
be really noticeable so the lip color
that I'm wearing today is the velvet lip
guide in the shade stripped from NARS
this is such a beautiful newly pink
shade and it glides on so nicely with
that
oh it smells good might have a bite if
you feel like your eyes are missing
something you can go in with a bit of
highlighter on your inner corner just to
make it look like you've done something
to the eyes this really opens them up as
well I'm just taking this on a little
pencil brush and dabbing it on and last
but not least to lock all of this makeup
in I'm taking the NYX Julie finish
makeup setting spray and just spritzing
this all over my face oh wow it was
Fritzing the other way okay so there we
have the finished makeup look I really
hope you guys liked it it's definitely
not a no makeup makeup look it's
something but still very put together
but can be done very very quickly so if
you like this video please give it a big
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
to my channel I love you and I will see
you in my next video bye
