my channel so in today's video I'm
trying out some Instagram beauty hacks
I've done I think two of these videos
before but there are some new hacks that
I want to try out and see if they
actually work so I hope you guys like
this video don't forget to subscribe if
you haven't already and let's jump into
it okay so the first thing that we're
going to do is and make a lip scrub so I
have this one here from Jeffrey star if
you look at it really closely it pretty
much just looks like sugar so let's try
and make our own concoction what I'm
going to do is take a tiny little bit of
water and then just add some raw sugar
in there so it should look something
like this I'm just going to dip my
toothbrush in and I'm going to scrub my
lips and this one is an old electric
toothbrush I'm just using any old head
I'm going to go to town oh it's flat and
we have to do it manually hmm
oh my god it hurts so much mmm it's
definitely getting off the dead skin
because it hurts which means it's
working right mm-hmm it feels kind of
cool wonder what tastes like okay so I
just washed it off and I would rate that
one literally a 10 out of 10 my lips
feel so smooth I have no dead skin on
there I'm so excited okay so I'm just
gonna put some lip balm on because
they're feeling a bit like dry but that
tasted amazing oh I feel like this one
is really going to work so what I'm
doing is taking a lot of foundation so
just say you're out of your diet
foundations you have a dark fake tan and
you need it to match your neck so I'm
going to take a bronzing beauty balm and
add it to my light foundation so I'm
just going to go ahead and mix some on a
metal plate I'm always straight tanning
so I feel like this one's gonna be
amazing
adding some beauty balm this is kind of
like a bronzing balm kind of thing
you're just adding a
double of that so it should look
something like this I'm just going to
mix the two together so with that
foundation I'm going to use the sock
Instagram hack so I've done this in a
separate video but I didn't wet this
sock so this time I have put some water
on this and then I've rinsed it out so
I'm just going to roll it up into a
little ball that's going to be just like
a Beauty Blender let's see if it works
better wet this time because last time
it like left little streaks on my face
just going to take that from the back of
my hand and I'm going to start putting
this into my face you can definitely
still see like little lines all over
your face but let's keep blending I mean
it works pretty well for a sock
I literally just use all of that
foundation for this little portion of my
face right here it's just all inside the
self now if you like using your fingers
would be a much more effective than a
wet sock so I'm going to give this one a
4 out of 10 as far as the beauty balm
goes to make it darker it definitely
works but you need to add a lot of the
bronzing product in there just because
it isn't as pigmented as a foundation so
the foundation is going to be showing
more than the beauty balm called it
added so much
oh as you can see around my nose area
it's just not blending honestly it's
just like I'm moving around every time I
try and Pat it um but this is the best
we're gonna get to be honest ok well I'm
pretty happy with how this turned out
now let's move on to the eyes and then
we can go back to the face after so what
I'm going to do is take the color pop
eyeliner this is just a black eyeliner
apparently if you drew a cross right
down here on the eyelid it's going to
give you the nice effect of like a smoky
eye alright here goes nothing oh good
I'm actually just going to use the Stila
eyeliner instead because it's a lot more
creamy now going to go in and blend this
out and you've got to be quick because I
feel like it's going to just dry really
easily
I'm just gonna drill this all over my
lid because I don't want to cross to be
stuck on my eyelid let's make it extra
smoky and I'm just using a synthetic
brush to blend this out it's not
blending uh it's stuck to my eyelid okay
so I think this is the best we're gonna
get it it looks so messy but I mean it
was fun to experiment now apparently you
can use mascara as eyeliner I feel like
obviously this could work to an extent
but it's going to be a bit patchy let's
give it a go I'm just going to put some
on the back of my hand and then I'm just
going to take a winged liner brush and
start aligning my lashline
Oh No look at that wing it's tragic it
does dry really really fast we have to
work quickly which I mean why would you
want to work quickly if you're doing
your eyeliner it's the hardest thing
ever the next beauty hack is going in
with some eye drops if you have a really
old mascara that has basically nothing
left or it's just dried up so I'm gonna
take the lid off and just add about
three drops in my mascara this is just
clear eyes eye drop well this does not
feel right one two three four the one
pretty much has nothing on it so I'm
just gonna swirl it around and see if it
works please ignore my actually if
that's what you want to call it oh well
I would have to say this is my favorite
hack in the video so far because before
the brush hardly had any mascara on it
and now it's working as good as new
I just went in with some concealer under
my eyes and when I was doing that I
realized that all of the mascara on my
lid right here is transferring because
obviously the eye drops are wet so there
goes that idea next I'm going in with
the Johnston's a baby powder and I'm
going to try and use this to bake under
my eyes apparently this can give you
cancer if you inhale it I'm not going to
breathe in for this part just putting
this on the back of your
okay so my first impression is that this
product goes on exactly like a
translucent powder would it's really
smooth it feels nice on the face so
we're going to dust it away and see if
it gives a wet cast obviously it will
come on now my god
I actually have no words I would rather
not let my concealer crease under my
eyes then put this under there ever
again it's making under my eyes look
really aged
it's like clinging to all of my wrinkles
um it's leaving a really really bad
white cast as you can see now this is
how you make yourself look 20 years
older than you actually are that next
beauty hack is it taking some cocoa
chocolate powder and using this as a
bronzer as a lot of you guys would know
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil has cocoa
in it so I mean let's try it I just
dipped my brush in there and now I'm
going to tap off any excess and then
blend this in like I wear with the
bronzer I'm like well that's actually
not as bad as I thought it would be okay
I hope I'm not getting too cocky with
this now this is working really really
well like what is happening right now
I'm gonna try and go around at my
forehead and voila we have a nice
bronzed complexion now this is amazing
okay so the next one is using an old
toothbrush as a spoolie to like rush
hour your eyebrows and stuff sometimes
bullies can be expensive and this would
just be free if it's not one and you're
ready to buy a new one so let's see if
it times in at all wow it's brushing all
those knots out how stunning now I'm
going to go ahead spray some hairspray
on here so we can set
this is so weird
it definitely is setting up my brows in
place and I am very impressed right now
they are not going anywhere today
this honestly works just as good as an
eyebrow selling product I mean it's
easier using like the gimme brow but
you're on a budget
the last Beauty hack is turning any
lipstick into a metallic lipstick so I'm
just going to go ahead and coat my lips
with the Mac in the shade faux and then
taking any highlighter I'm just going to
pick up some with a brush and Pat this
on my lips
oh my god I'm actually really impressed
look how good that looks
oh okay so there we have the finished
look I looked so tragic right now but it
was really fun to just try some
different hacks and see if they work
I feel like majority of the time hacks
are pointless and stupid and shouldn't
even be done but I feel like it's fun to
watch them the highlighter one was
definitely my favorite eyedrops one at
first I thought was really good and then
it just transferred onto my skin because
the product is wet another favorite of
mine was the eyebrows and the bronzer
the eyes which is Treach the powder was
tragic anyways I really hope you guys
