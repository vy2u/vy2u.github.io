sir I literally cut my hair off and dad
it really Brown so like what do you mean
I know it's so different right now I'm
going to the hairdresser's today and I'm
going a little bit late because I feel
like it is super dark and I want it the
time it line up so yeah I cut my hair
off I will show you guys how short is at
the end of the video so make sure you
stick around to speed that but in
today's video I'm gonna go ahead and do
like a 5-minute drugstore makeup look
because I haven't done anything really
simple for quite some time so let's go
ahead and jump into the video I've
already gone ahead and cleansed and
moisturized my face and I let that sit
in just so anything we put over the top
isn't gonna like move around too much
that's all ready to go now I'm gonna go
in with primer and I'm using the nude by
Nature perfecting a primer so I'm just
gonna use this just smooth out my skin
and also to make sure I makeup stays on
all day I'm just sorry happy that I
actually had the balls to cut my hair
off I was on my way to the hairdresser's
and I'm like I was first to just be
getting like a bit more blonde in my
hair my long hair and I was like you're
what I am sir irva having long hair
because I never do anything with it
I literally just chuck it up all the
time like this
and I just wanted to be able to curl my
hair and for it to not to take as long
and honestly I had long hair since I was
great
like literally my whole life I've always
had long hair and I'm like I need a
change like what is going on so cut it
off
hmm my skin is the foundation I'm gonna
start using some reds I never really
used so today I'm taking be nude by
Nature flawless at liquid foundation and
this one's in the shade at classic tan
and I'm just gonna put one pump on the
back of my hand and then go in up with
their buffing brush and we're gonna make
our face look absolutely flawless and
match it to my fake tan of my neck I
love that color
that's literally perfect hmm it's
finally happened to have match my face
to my neck without it looking horrible
this one has a really good coverage and
it is super quick drying so you want to
make sure you blend it in nice and quick
so this foundation is perfect Oh God if
a bubble my throat it's per for you guys
that have sensitive skin because there's
no nasties in that that makes your skin
react about there anything so there's no
like fragrances or silicon or anything
like that which is perfect and if you do
want to build up the coverage you can
just go in with another layer and just
dab on that product to build it out so
we can hide all those imperfections I
can't remember the last time I actually
used a foundation that had all natural
ingredients like what this is amazing
maybe I should start doing that more
often because my skin has been breaking
out sorry bad around this area
oh I'm sorry for it so at least we can
use something that's good for your skin
okay so now let's move on to getting rid
of these the bags under my eyes so I'm
going in with the nude by Nature
flawless concealer in the shade at zero
three shell beige so we're gonna real
camouflage these bags under here so I'm
just going to put this under my eyes I
love how my skin looks so natural still
I'm also gonna put a bit on my eyelids
as well does it have a lot of fangs up
there that I really want to come off
even though I've got a really good sleep
last night I have horrible dark circles
today so that needs to go oh my gosh I'm
so impressed with that concealer because
it's not sitting in my fine lines like a
lot of concealer does like under my eyes
and makes it look really wrinkly so
looks great nice - not true
next up I'm gonna go in with my Rimmel
match perfection at silky loose face
powder and I'm just going to put a tiny
bit of powder right underneath my eyes
just taking my Beauty Blender and
patting that under here quick makeup
look so my favorite cuz like I hate
where I keep some makeup out it's really
hot and it's really hot trust me and
then I'm gonna go in with the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless press palette
this one's in the shade at 220 so I'm
just going to Pat this all over my face
to make sure everything is completely
set down so next I'm gonna go in with
this Ardell sculpting atbara gel and I
just want to use this to push
my eyebrows up it makes them look really
full if you do want to fill your
eyebrows in go for your life I just have
my brows tattooed on so I didn't really
need to what I'm doing like her very
natural makeup look but this makes the
brows look amazing
really feathery next up I'm going in
with bronzer and I'm gonna take the NYC
smooth skin and bronzing a face powder I
have the shade sunny I love this stuff
so much and it's so affordable so I'm
just going to bronze up my face a little
bit and the brush it I'm using today oh
girl it is the morphe m40a3 brush all
the morphe brushes are so affordable so
if you're looking for some new good ones
they are amazing I'm just gonna take
this around my forehead as well oh my
god I seriously can't get over my brown
hair so weird I'm also just gonna take
that down my neck a little bit as well
so everything matches perfect
next up is to go in with blush so I'm
gonna take this one from essence it is
the blossom dreams blush in the shade is
everyone call me coral so this one's
very shimmery so I'm gonna use this as a
blush and a highlight so I'm just gonna
put this on the apples of my cheeks and
blend it back it's gonna add a nice glow
to the face so pretty
is there saying something in my teeth
the whole time oh my god I actually
can't get it out it's stuck
next up is to go in and curl my
eyelashes because I literally have the
shortest lashes in the world so this
just makes it that tiny bit longer
I'm just get up pumping in a few times
wow that actually makes the biggest
difference I don't know why but my
lashes are just shrunk literally no
they're full one out in the past like
three months or they look bold if I
don't do this next up is a mascara time
so I'm gonna take this the bomb scuba Oh
water-resistant Noir change of plans I'm
gonna go in with this NYX for lashes
mascara and I'm just gonna cursed my top
and bottom lashes
oh my god this makes them so fluffy
since everything else didn't take that
long at all I'm gonna go in with some
lashes to make it look like I've
actually spent a little bit of extra
time doing my makeup so these ones are
from the brand Holy Grail these are
actually like cheaper than drugstore
lashes at very very affordable so I'm
gonna pop these ones on in the style of
whispies so that perfect for like an
everyday look but you can definitely
wear them out as well because they're
very muddy I like still wet fluffy I
mean sorry I'm gonna go ahead and trim
these down cuz my eyes ain't that long I
don't usually apply lashes for like an
everyday look but um today I feel like
it because I'm looking a little bit bold
with my brown hair needs some blackness
on that lashes y'all
excuse me Ben I'm gonna run over your
tail if you don't sure next step is the
lips so I'm gonna go in with this a wet
and wild liquid lipstick in the shade or
rose I've never used this one before oh
my god oh I'm excited to see what this
looks like there because I don't really
know pink wax me but like it's a really
pretty pinky purple
well the applicator is really soft Wow
very impressed with that outs are really
good and the formula is like really
light as well
thick for everyday let's go ahead and
finish off the makeup look with some
makeup setting spray so this one is the
Rimmel in star fixon girl oh okay well I
guess it's time to go into fix my hair
