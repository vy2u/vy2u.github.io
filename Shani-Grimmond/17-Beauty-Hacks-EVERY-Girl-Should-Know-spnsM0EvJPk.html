the most popular hack it is putting a
little bit of tape on the edge of your
eye to create the perfect wing this
honestly makes my life so much easier
so clean it up a little bit after you
pull the tape off and first the time it
will look perfect boob contouring sorry
this was actually my first time trying
it and it was kind of fun but it was a
little bit hard so I was taking a darker
foundation in the hollows while making
my own hollows and then highlighting the
bits that you want to kind of stick out
a bit more so it's kind of like
contouring and highlighting your face
it's just on your breasts I think it
really works well with the collarbones
but didn't really do anything to the
borough barrier don't think I'll be
using this but it was fun hey shiny how
do I get a streak-free tan well honey
you're at the right place so all you
have to do is get a really big fat
powder brush like a makeup brush and
just brush away at your tan and it gets
rid of all the streaks and it also works
really well with blending the ten into
your hands and on your ankles and knees
and stuff it just works so well would
definitely recommend this if you have a
spare powder brush laying around if you
only have a pressed powder you can still
bake under your eyes all you have to do
is scrape up the powder a little bit it
works the exact same as a loose powder
this is the Rimmel stay matte and I was
so impressed when I did this it works
the exact same as my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and it is so
incredibly highlighting look at that
beauty blender is my favorite makeup
tool ever so I'm filling up a disposable
water spritzer with water and I'm just
using you to spray my Beauty Blender
instead of having to go under the sink
with it so this is really helpful if
you're traveling or if you just super
lazy
this one is perfect if you want a really
chiseled cheek bone so all you have to
do is take like your business card or a
blush in my case and just bronze as you
normally would except this is going to
leave you a really nice sharp line so
obviously go back and blend it out and
you are fierce as they come girlfriend
so this one is quite important when
you're brushing your beautiful luscious
locks you want to start from the bottom
of your hair and then work your way up
just so you don't have any breakage
oh yeah girlfriend break it down did you
know that you could use eyeshadow adds
highlighters so just take a champagne
pearly shimmery shade and put that on
your cheekbones and it works pretty much
the exact same if you are using makeup
geek eyeshadows be very careful because
they are very pigmented so tap off that
excess this one is actually pretty cool
so if you have a broken powder product
we're going to have to do to fix it is
break it up even more I mean it's really
broken you may as well do it more don't
be afraid and then take some rubbing
alcohol and pull this in until it gets a
little bit wet and sloppy and then
you're gonna take like a tissue or
something to absorb the excess product
up and it's kind of good as new except
it has a weird texture to it if you
don't have any eyebrow gel and your
brows are all over the place all you
have to do is take some waxy lip balm
and just pop that straight in and
they're not going anywhere for the whole
day it's not so good by the way I was
like living for this moment
if you want a really crisp eyeshadow
line all you have to do is take some
scotch tape on your hand to get rid of
the stickiness and then put it straight
on your eye do your eye shadow as normal
I'm sure you guys have seen me do this
in my videos before if you're new please
subscribe and then once you pull it off
it looks so clean so crisp love it now
it's time to clean our makeup brushes so
Johnson's baby shampoo is the best way
to go it's honestly the cheapest brush
cleaner you can get well technically on
a brush cleaner but it works just as
well it cleans them 100% definitely
recommend this stuff I shadow fall out
oh my god guys how annoying is it so all
I'm doing is taking some scotch tape
with a sticky side on the outside
wrapping it around my finger and gently
padding on fall out and there it is
voila if you have trouble applying false
lashes maybe tried this way so just put
some lash glue right on your lash line
with a little brush and pop the lashes
down and they have nowhere else to stick
but on the lash line so easy
I'm praying to God that you guys already
do this but just in case I want to let
you know it is extremely important to
change your pillowcase at least once a
week because there's lots of buildup of
dirt and dust and all that gross stuff
and that causes breakouts so make sure
you do that if you guys want your lips
to look a bit more plump try doing an
ombre lip effect so just line your lips
with any color you want and then doing
it the darker shade on the outside of
lips and the lighter shade on the inside
and last but not least if you guys want
your lipstick to turn map just take a
bit of toilet paper and peel it in half
so it's a really thin layer take some
translucent powder and Pat that all over
your lips and then your lips are manner
without buying a matte lipstick so there
we have everything I hope you guys liked
it and found this fun or helpful if you
did please give it a big thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
