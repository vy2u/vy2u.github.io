want to say I'm sorry with my voice and
noise you in this video I am sick I
sound a bit like a man but I still want
to get some videos up for you guys so I
let's start would be a sexy devil makeup
look these two books are extremely
extremely easy and can be done very
quickly and I thought to be perfect for
a last-minute Halloween look so let's go
ahead and start by priming the eyes I've
already done my eyebrows off camera
because it takes so long
so just chucking some concealer on it
then going in with some powder to set
that now for the eye shadow I'm going in
with the Mac give me Sun and this is
gonna be the transition shade pretty
much the only shade that we use as
eyeshadow today so just taking this from
inner corner to outer corner to add some
to the eyelids then for the fun part I'm
taking true Jeffrey style liquid
lipsticks a really bright red and also
like a darker red and I'm gonna take the
light red for the lash line and then
taking the dark red I'm using this to
make the flick but by the end of it it
pretty much just came into one color as
you can see on the right eye I have a
little bump in my liner no now it's time
to prime the face I'm taking the Alpha
primer I'm just popping this all over to
make sure the foundation goes on super
smooth and to make sure it stays on all
night then going in with the Dior air
flash foundation I'm just popping this
all over with a flat top kabuki brush
this leaves the most beautiful full
coverage finish I love love love it I
just wish the shade was a little bit
darker for my fake tan but we got this
hon going in with some concealer I'm
just gonna use this to hide any dark
circles under the eyes and then I'm just
gonna set that down with some powder
just going through this it's super quick
because it is a last-minute look then
going in and setting the rest of my face
with a powder so there's no shine
throughout
then taking a a red eyeshadow I'm gonna
take this from inner corner to outer
corner on the lower lash line just
because I feel like the red line I
needed to be like proportioned out of it
because it is so bold then I went in
with a brown shade just to make it a bit
more wearable on that lower lash line
because red is really intense and kind
of makes the eye look infected so now
going in with mascara I'm just gonna cut
these puppies top and bottom I love
really long Slattery lashes so much now
going in with the Mac eye shadow in the
shade no lon this is a beautiful
shimmery champagne shade I'm just
popping this on my inner corners to add
a nice highlight now for the lashes I'm
taking the I spy in the style Luna I
love this so much I've been reaching for
this style a lot lately so this makes a
look look 20 times better especially
with red line are going in with some
mascara to make them extra extra thick
now time to contour I'm taking it to
shades from the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour palette and just contain Mar
chiseled cheekbones well at least making
them look chisel then going back in with
my Mac it give me Sun I'm using this to
warm up the face I love an icicle oh so
I'm adding this to my cheekbones and
also a round at my forehead now going in
with blush I'm just using this to add a
little bit of color back into the cheeks
so just popping this on the apples and
then blending it back now time for the
fun part I'm taking some highlighter
this one is from earth FRA sir I just
sprayed my highlighter brush with some
fix+
and look how intense that is I was like
even myself I was like wow I really need
to like calm down and blend this out but
it is absolutely stunning so now to
finish off the lips I'm taking the
Jeffrey style liquid lipstick again the
darker shade and popping this oh my god
I'm so annoying I keep saying popping oh
just putting this all over my lips
such a beautiful shader then I'm gonna
go in with the lighter shade and just
put this right in the middle to make it
a bit more of an ombre effect then
taking some thick gooey blood gel I'm
just gonna put this from the outer
corner of my mouth just like I was
bleeding and I'm leaning back so it
really sinks in to my leg bum fluff on
my face and you're how you get like a
fluffy hair there yeah and you haze then
I put some lip gloss on and voila we are
done make sure you add some horns and
that is a basic AF Halloween tutorial
hope you guys like it now let's move on
to the sexy cat look all right a new day
a new makeup I'm going in with this that
Chloe Morello eyeshadow palette it has
so many stunning shades I'm just gonna
take the shades skinny dip and it this
is gonna be the transition so again
taking this from inner corner to outer
corner you guys know the drill now going
in with the shade jetsetter this one is
going in the crease to make it look more
defined and then taking even darker
shade I'm basically just gonna put this
right over the top to make the crease
look more consistent you know because I
don't really think I have a crease it
doesn't really show
so here's when things get a little bit
messy I put on a shade that honestly did
not match the eyeshadow at all so I went
over the top with more of a purple
eternai shadow to match the crease and I
actually like how it turned out overall
so now taking a champagne shade this is
going on the inner corners to highlight
a bit love a good highlight
then of course going in with mascara
putting heaps and heaps of that on and
then I'm putting some falsies on I love
me some Lily lashes that sir big and
fluffy
okay so time for the base I'm taking the
PP primer this is stunning it is so arid
Essen and it makes your skin look super
glowy then I'm gonna go in with a
foundation to match my face to my neck
and to add some coverage to my face this
one is amazing the hourglass foundation
but it does make my face look a little
bit oily I really wish it didn't because
the formula is amazing and the coverage
is like everything then going in with
the maybelline fitme concealer I just
picked up a new one it is absolutely
amazing I would definitely recommend it
to you guys then just blending that in
with a Beauty Blender and then to set
that all down I'm taking some air Saban
a translucent powder and baking under
the pass then of course to set the rest
of my face I'm taking the a Mac select
shared powder and just packing this on
with a really thick brush because I made
will add some extra coverage while in
there then for my lower lash line I'm
taking a dark purple and I'm just
popping this from inner corner to add a
corner then I took a lot of purple that
was also in the crease and just kind of
blew that darker purple out to make it
look more fluffy is that even like a
word to describe makeup fluffy a
probably not now it's time to add the
inner corner for the cat's look oh my
god this took so long
honestly I had to do it like 100 times
and then today please focus
thought this was the best I could do so
we're just gonna have to go with it
alright so then going in with some black
eyeshadow I'm just putting this on the
middle part of my lower lash line just
so the inner corner kind of blends in
better then finishing off with some like
eyeliner and some mascara on the lower
lashes then going in with my favorite
contour shade ever this is the benefit
hoola I feel like the show just works on
so many different skin tones and it
never looks muddy then going in with
some bronzer this one is from our
cosmetics and again
we're running out my cheekbones and
around my head oh this is kind of weird
like repeating myself what back then
doing a bit of baking under my bronzer
because I blow my bronzer a little bit
too far down so this just sharpens it up
and of course putting some blush on the
apples of my cheeks and then she asked
with some highlighter I'm using the
white and pink shade in the glow care
and on my god like what
Rohan's is stunning
then going in with a yellow and a white
powder I'm just gonna put this above my
top lip and this is going to have the
effect of that area coming out more and
oh my god it'll look so where when you
really stare at it because it really
does come out further then going in with
some liquid liner I'm just gonna add
some at random little dots all over my
top lip but not too many don't want too
crowded now taking some up black
eyeshadow and a winged liner brush I'm
just going to draw some little whiskers
on my face I really like the effect of
eyeshadow instead of liner just because
it looks softer and it is a lot easier
to do especially if you make a mistake
then I'm going in with a liquid liner to
add more definition to the whiskers but
just doing a few now it's time to drawn
the cute little nose so I drew a little
love heart and my god I am so messy but
I'm just trying my best trying to make
it as neat as I can then I'm just gonna
fill up my lips in with the black liquid
lipstick and lip liner from Kylie
cosmetics I honestly never thought I
would use this shade in my life but hey
came in handy once so that's good
so now just drawing a line from under my
nose to my Cupid's bow and then
finishing off with some lip gloss to
make my lips look super glossy and of
course this step is optional to add eye
contacts but yeah there we have the
finished makeup looks I really hope you
guys liked it make sure you let me know
in the comments below what your favorite
look is do you like the devil or the cat
better I love you guys so so much and I
will see you in my next video
