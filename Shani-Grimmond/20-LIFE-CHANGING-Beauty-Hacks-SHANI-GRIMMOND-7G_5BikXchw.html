so in today's video I'm doing it 20
beauty hacks I am so excited for this
video because you guys seem to love all
of my hacks so make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up and don't forget
to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already so you can be notified
when I upload more videos I love you
guys so much and let's go ahead and drop
into the video ok so the first pack is
one of my personal favorites if you have
ran out of lipstick all you need to do
is take a really pigmented blush your
favorite lip balm and mix it up to make
a little concoction and this was so
pigmented and so moisturizing I really
loved this one and to top it off the
color was stunning the next pack is
going in with your favorite sunless
tanner and I'm just going to take an old
a makeup brush that I can get dirty pump
a little bit onto a tissue and blend it
out so we don't have it too much then
I'm just going to apply it like a
bronzer so I can have some natural
definition to the face just for the days
where I don't want to wear makeup at all
it's just a bit of a glow as well so
just putting this under my cheekbones
and jaw bone then I'm taking a tissue to
clean a little bit under my cheekbones
so it's a little bit more clean but I'm
making sure that it is still nice and
blended
and voila let's go ahead and make our
own cream blush so I'm just taking a
rosy pink lipstick and warming it up on
the back of my hand so it blends into
the cheeks easier and just going in with
a stippling brush so I'm just putting
this on the apples of my cheeks and
after lending it back and this just adds
a beautiful luminous glow and at the
same time it's going to give you a nice
flush of color as well if you feel like
your foundation isn't as full coverage
as you'd like just go ahead and take a
medium to full coverage powder just a
little bit into the foundation and mix
it up and it is going to add so much
more coverage to your face so on this
side I'm going to show you what it looks
like without the powder as you can see
it isn't covering as much I like a light
coverage foundation but obviously
sometimes you want to switch it up so on
this side you can obviously see that
there's no skin protein through at all
it just makes the foundation a lot
thicker and you do have to use a little
bit more foundation so you're going to
be using more product
at the end of the day but it definitely
definitely does work so this one is a
really weird but trust me it works I'm
just taking a tampon and some nail
polish remover and using this to take
off my nail polish I actually had gel on
so it wasn't coming off but just an
example if you don't have any cotton
balls left
this works well and it's better than
using tissues as well because tissues
leaves little balls behind nope thanks
girl all right let's go ahead and draw
on some first circles so I'm just taking
a bobby pin opening it up and then using
a dip brow pomade and dipping it in and
just going in all over my face I think
freckles are absolutely beautiful if you
do have natural freckles I think they're
stunning and if you don't start stunning
as well but if you do want to play
around with makeup this is a perfect way
to do it it's really easy just go in
with a stippling brush and blend them
out a little bit so they look a little
bit more natural this one is for
everyone that has really naturally
straight lashes so what I'm going to do
on this side is just curl my lashes
normally as you can see on me this works
perfectly fine as it is because I
naturally have kind of curly lashes but
if you do have straight lashes go ahead
and take a blow-dryer onto your eyelash
curler make sure it isn't hot just make
sure it's a little bit warm you do not
want to burn your eyes make sure you
take it first and this honestly it like
my lashes like not permanently but for
the day they say it curly
now I'm just going to go ahead and take
a regular eyes shutter and what I'm
going to do to make it multi minted is
your white eyeliner down first as the
base and then I'm just going to put it
directly over the top so as you can see
it definitely shows up a lot more but
this is only going to work for really
bright colors another weird line so I'm
just going to take a liner it's going to
the line of the better so I'm just going
to cut the edges off with some scissors
that put it on the back of my hand so
it's not too sticky and I'm going to use
this as a shadow shield so it's going to
catch any eye shadow that falls down
what a great creation
if you don't have a steady hand just
like I do and you want to contour your
nose just take an eyeshadow brush and
use that as a guide when you're
contouring so I'm just taking a dark
concealer and then blending it in with a
Beauty Blender and it is so straight and
so perfect no time to mess up all right
now to clean up the contour another tip
that I have is going in with a light
translucent powder and just running this
right next to the contour so don't put
it on top because that's going to seat
the purpose because it will brighten it
a little bit but just beside so leave it
on for five minutes
and generous is going to be snatched if
your foundation is too dark for you just
go in with any light concealer and it
makes a little bit into the foundation
and it will be matching up perfectly in
no time this one is a really basic hack
but I feel like a lot of people forget
it including myself so so you go tell if
you have a really dried up liquid
lipstick just go in with your favorite
lip balm croute your lips and apply it
like you normally would this way it's
going to be really moisturizing on the
lips and it's going to be so much easier
to apply this one is another personal
favorite of mine so I'm taking an
eyeshadow and using this to highlight my
face so sometimes I think that this
actually works just as well if not
better than an actual highlighter will
some because some highlighters are balm
but this looks stunning you can use any
election panie
light shades and they work perfectly
another baking hack so going back in
with my translucent powder I'm using
this to clean up any of the eyeshadow
that may have came out a little bit too
far so just using my Beauty Blender and
it's really going to sharpen that line
but it's not going to be too harsh so
while that's baking it let's move on to
another hack and just taking some eye
drops and a black eye shadow and I'm
just going to scrape that off and mix a
little bit of eye drops in there and
this is going to create a little bit of
a mascara but it's not going to add any
texture or anything it's just going to
really lock in up those lashes because
you know if you run out of mascara you
need something on the lashes to make
them super dog oh so random but I'm just
taking a tooth brush and creating them
like I would with mascara and not long
what they definitely black now going
back in to clean up that translucent
powder just being really gentle because
I don't want to move any of that
concealer and hello darlin a clean line
that's not too sharp so the next pack is
and making any fluffy brush a contour
brush so what I'm going to do is take a
bobby pin I open it up and I'm just
going to pinch the sides of the brushes
this is so weird I was like what am i
doing but the brush alone after it
doesn't roll it or anything I'm just
really pinching it so we can get a nice
- fine line when we're contouring and
it's not going to be blown out too far
if you have any dried up old eyeliners
go ahead and take a lighter and try not
to actually set it on fire like I did
the first time just run it under the
lighter really really quickly for
literally not even a second and then
you're going to have a nice creamy
eyeliner right here I have another
eyeliner hack so I'm just taking a
metallic eyeliner and going in and
filling my lips in because I feel like
metallic lips are cool but I don't want
to buy a liquid lipstick doesn't I like
just because I don't use it that often
so I feel like it's not really worth
some money but this actually does look
really cool and it was surprisingly
comfortable on the lips it's just not
going to last as long but it still works
if you have dirty makeup brushes and a
spare block of soap laying around I
definitely recommend using that to clean
the brushes I love this stuff one
because it is it really moisturizing and
it's going to clean the brushes at the
same time and just top it off it's going
to take two seconds because you actually
just holding it there swelling swelling
done this is the hatch that you guys
have probably seen on my channel before
so I'm just going to take a pressed
powder and I'm using this to basically
bake underneath my Efron's eye but
instead it's like so much easier so I'm
just going to clean up any bronze with
that may have gone down a little bit too
far and it is so much easier next pack
and the last hack of all if you have a
liquid lipstick that is really hard to
take off all you have to do is put on
some lip balm over the top let it soak
in and then a wipe it straight off with
some tissue or toilet paper and bone
girl it's off so here we have the
finished hacks I really hope you guys
