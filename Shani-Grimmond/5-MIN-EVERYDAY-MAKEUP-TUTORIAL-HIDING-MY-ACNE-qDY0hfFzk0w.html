channel sorry in today's video I really
quickly just want to show you how I do
like my everyday makeup most of the time
I don't usually wear makeup but recently
my skin has been so bad like the worst
it's ever been and I'm just like
sometimes I want to put a little tiny
bit of makeup on I pretty much had bad
skin since I was in high school but then
I went on the pill for a few years and
that kind of masked all my pimples for a
few years now I'm off the pill again so
my skin is kind of back to normal so I
just really quickly want to share with
you what I do to cover all of my
blemishes and kind of just enhance my
natural features so let's go ahead and
jump right into the video the first
thing that I've been loving to do is go
in with my bare minerals bare skin
complete coverage serum concealer and
the reason why I like this to pop what
conceal oh my god I can't speak today is
because the formula is like really
liquidy so it's not like really thick
and it doesn't look cakey on the skin it
just blends out really easily and this
color is perfect as well this one's in
the shade light so I'm always faked
hurting my neck and not my face because
I don't want anything on my face that
could make it break out even more so oh
my god gross a pimple is like ready to
go I'm just gonna start dabbing this on
my skin just to hide the redness of all
of the breakouts that's really all I
want to do like I don't want to put
foundation all over my face I honestly
hate laying foundation on an everyday
basis I just want to cover the red spots
and make sure your hands are super clean
because then I like to go and Pat my
skin you can pick up any excess products
I like to take whatever is left and kind
of just like blend it up on my cheeks as
well because I have very red cheeks I'm
trying my best to get rid of all of the
breakouts it's just not working
I've tried eating better I've tried
changing my skincare routine I've tried
acne um or they called anybody I do my
god I've literally done it all a really
important thing as well is to make sure
you don't apply the concealer straight
on to your breakouts because it
may spread the bacteria and you could
like to spread your breakouts out a
little bit oh and if you're wondering I
just got my eyebrows tattooed on so this
is the darkest stage that there will be
so usually the first day they look
really good the second day they just go
super dark because the pigment is like
grabbing onto the skin so over the next
week or so my eyebrows are going to be a
lot lighter so don't stress but usually
I wouldn't even touch my eyebrows anyway
if I was like going out for the day
because they are tattooed on but I think
a great thing if you want to do this you
can just put a little bit of eyebrow gel
in your brows and then just kind of like
push them up and it just adds a little
bit more volume in there and you can get
ones that are colored as well if you
want to add some tint alright guys it's
time goodbye old friend
we're not actually goodbye because you
can still see the lump in my skin but
gets rid of the redness that's the
lining I might just take a tiny bit of
that and run that under my eyes just
where I have a little bit of
discoloration but I'm not gonna put too
much on there at all because I feel like
when you block out those like pebbly
tones under the eyes it makes my eyes
look really beady so I still want to
have a little bit of color showing
through there okay so now for the
important part I'm gonna go with one of
my new favorite mascaras this one's from
iconic London it's called the Broome
lash mascara this makes your lashes so
incredibly long and because I'm not
wearing a falsies owner I have eyedrops
my lashes fuel because I'm not wearing
falsies today I absolutely go in I just
like to make my lashes look super long
so this one has a really nice small one
so you can really get into like every
single crevices of your lashes so I like
to start from the roots and wiggle my
way upwards this really separates like
every single lash and it makes them so
long like how I think the most important
thing with applying mascara is making
sure you start from the very bottom of
the lashes working your way up
my lashes actually look like daddy
longlegs I'm talking about so as you can
see this I literally looks naked sorry
I'm gonna go in to place a mole on the
other one so we can even it out so I'm
just gonna leave my lower lashes free
just because I don't like the feeling of
massive lashes on my lower lash line
when I don't have a lot of makeup on so
the next thing that I'm gonna do is add
a bit of a glow to my face or I'm gonna
go in with the Anastasio liquid glory
this one's in the shade at pearl and I'm
just gonna apply this on the back of my
hand just a tiny little bit and then I'm
gonna take a little stippling brush and
I'm just going to pack this on my
cheekbones just a little bit I just want
a little bit of a glow on my face
because it is quite flat obviously
because I don't have a lot of product on
and then I'm just gonna blend over it
with my finger just till I can melt it
into my skin you can see it just like
reflects a lot so beautifully Oh an
ulcer I don't tan my face
just because I don't want my pupils to
like break out even more so obviously
when I'm not wearing a lot of makeup I
just rock this a lot face and a tan
buddy the next thing that I like to do
is go in with my liner lips one eye one
appointment this stuff is incredible for
the lips it makes it look so glossy so I
just like to put a tiny bit well a lot
of this on my lips so all of the focus
is on there's long lashes and the juicy
lip but yes that is pretty much all for
this makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it
as I said it's super simple anyone can
do this obviously but I just wanted to
show you guys my take on what I do when
I don't really feel comfortable in my
own skin when I'm having a bad skin day
um I know everyone's skin is beautiful
whether you do or don't have breakouts
everyone has bad skin days and I know
what it feels like to feel crappy about
that sometimes so that's why I thought
I'd make this video I'll leave
everything that I've used down in the
description below if you are interested
in anything I love you guys it's so much
and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
