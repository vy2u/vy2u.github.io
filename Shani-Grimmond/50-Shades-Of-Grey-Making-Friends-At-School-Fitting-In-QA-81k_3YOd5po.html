room this is the first video I filmed in
my room
I still haven't completed it it's so
boring but I do love white as you can
see right here I can't wait till I can
actually do a room to other because I
just love sharing my life with you guys
so yeah I'm doing a back to school or a
school themed question answers video the
last theme one I did it was about boys
which does not surprise me yes so before
I get into the questions I just want to
give you guys a little update on what's
been happening so if you guys have kept
up with my vlogs and you would know that
I've been in my new house for about a
week now and a lot of people have been
asking if I've settled in if I'm like
liking it how's it going what's the
experience like I am completely in love
with it living by myself or living with
my friend Courtney we're just getting
along so well I'm having so much fun I
love the privacy and just so like this
silence that I get because I know at my
mom's house like we had I have a little
brother and sister and they're just
running around screaming all the time
and I'm like Oh silence I'm never gonna
get it so now it's just amazing I love
it here it's like literally not one
thing that I don't like about living by
myself it is amazing and I still go and
see my mum and my siblings like
literally every single day I've been
over there every day for the last weeks
so yes I am loving it here Courtney do
the dishes I cleaned up after you this
morning you owe me okay so last night I
went to see the movie Fifty Shades of
Grey and I was surprised with how many
people were messaging me sending me hate
messages on tumblr just because I went
to see that movie I was actually mine
blonde so a lot of people were like why
are you encouraging like abusive
relationships and stuff like that and I
was like girl step back a bit I
literally have read half of the first
book at that point I had anything read
half the first book I was not really
sure well I think we all know what kind
of happens in that movie and there's
like whips and chains and all of that
and I'm aware I'm aware of that I I mean
everyone how do I go about this I'm not
encouraging this whole lack whips and
chains and stuff like that but everyone
has their own kind of taste when it
comes to sexual intercourse and I think
if they want it and they're able to have
a say
they're able to say no no more than I
think it's fine you know if that's what
they want it's their life you know what
I'm saying so I don't know why people
are you know getting more crazy and my
tumblr asked box just because I want to
see the movie I'm not using whips and
chains
I'm just watching a movie oh yeah the
last thing that I want to talk about is
the pill so a lot of you guys may know
that I went on the pill like last week I
went on the pill estelle for my emotions
because I was having issues with that
and also my face I was having really bad
hormonal breakouts and a real over the
like I remember irregular periods so I
wouldn't look hill for that and I've
already missed it twice it's making me
feel really kind of nauseous in the
morning like I feel like I want to vomit
because I'm so hungry like that's the
kind of sickness I get like I'm really
hungry I just want to eat everything but
I don't want it I don't know well I feel
like I should eat but I don't want to
eat what I eat anyway I don't know how
to describe it but I've been feeling a
bit sick I feel like my blades starting
to it used to it now my skin is
disgusting my skin under all of this
makeup has never been so bad in my life
I looked at the mirror in the mirror at
myself yesterday and I was like oh my
god I've never felt this uncomfortable
in my own skin before I was shocked
okay so let's jump into the questions I
asked you guys on Twitter Tumblr and
Facebook so let's start with the Twitter
ones because I always find those the
most interesting what is my hand doing
so the first question is what was your
most embarrassing moment at school and
this was definitely at my school formal
sorry they were calling up Awards and
the award was who would most likely be a
superstar or famous or some question
like that and I was just sitting there
casually and then my name gets called up
and I was like oh my god this is so
embarrassing sir I went to stand up and
my flippin formal dress was caught in my
high heels so I was like tumbling across
the ground for like a minute straight
trying to get my dress out of my chute
no so embarrassing everyone was staring
at me so I guess that's not really
embarrassing I mean it was at the time
but when I say it out loud it doesn't
really seem that bad
I mean re I mean I didn't really have
many people to impress at high school so
I didn't really get embarrassed that
much so nothing really next question is
what subjects did you do at school I did
English
recreation hospitality early childhood
yeah five
I had five subjects and I dropped one of
them because I did a cert three in
hospitality
so rec was so boring it was just about
sports and yeah about first aid and all
of that and I'm really not interested
I got Sue's so I just passed hospitality
was fine we just did heaps of cooking
and stuff and I got B's for that English
and maths were so easy because I was in
the really easy math because I didn't
want to go for a qce
I mean I don't want to go for an RP I
just went for a QC e what's the other
one oh yeah an early childhood I wasn't
really a fan of early childhood but I
guess it was good learning about
children and their disabilities and just
like you know having a baby and what
happens to your body and stuff I mean
that was interesting and I'm definitely
not having a baby until I'm like 29 or
something because we took a baby home
you're the ones that have like the
crying monitors in them and it was
crying every two hours or every hour and
I was like don't you baby and she's like
oh my god usually that doesn't happen
that usually they don't wake up every
hour or two it's usually like every
three or four hours so I was unlucky and
I got the dodgy baby next question is
how did you deal with all the stress um
well I was really stressed actually
throughout grade 11 and 12 just because
I leave everything to the last minute so
a way to deal with stress with the
schoolwork I would say just start things
early and just do little things every
single day because it actually helps in
the long run so yeah just start things
early don't leave everything to the last
minutes which is kind of easier said
than done because I always left things
to last-minute even after like how many
years at school is there for after like
12 years of schooling I left everything
true the very last second like night
before I'm not even kidding so yeah that
would have to be the biggest biggest tip
how to make school enjoyable since you
have to go I would just say surround
yourself with good people at school I
mean hopefully at your school you have a
bunch of good people I had eventual of
amazing amazing friends that were so
supportive we talked about everything
personal so it wasn't really like you go
to school to learn I mean I went to
school to talk to my friends and I
learnt as well I mean that's how I met
enjoyable what was your life schedule
you went to school with YouTube videos
and stuff and when I was in school I
kind of just did videos every weekend I
would literally lock myself in my room
every single weekend and I wouldn't go
out and socialize and I never had a
problem with that I've always been like
really dedicated to my videos I stopped
for a little bit though because I did
stop getting dedicated around the
holiday area I did stop uploading a lot
and I have already apologized for that I
was just in a bit of a rut mm-hmm
someone said a planning on going to
college uni in Australia it's called I
know I'm not interested in anything uni
study related I just want to keep doing
what I'm doing I'm having so much fun
with it and I think the most important
thing in life is to be happy with what
you're doing be happy with your job
because then it won't feel like a job I
mean this doesn't feel like a job at all
this is something that I'm completely
completely passionate about and I think
if you can find something that you're
passionate about then stick to it so no
I'm not going to uni my mum actually
went to a psychic the other day and
they're like I can see that shiny um is
gonna be studying soon maybe nursing and
I'm like no thanks I'm gonna keep doing
my YouTube videos thanks mate the next
question is how do you manage fitting in
with a group of friends now I was never
necessarily in that position I you know
I was really friends with the people
that I was hanging out with when I was
in primary school so I didn't have to go
through the whole making friends thing
I'm sorry about it making friends
because I'm so shy I never make the
first move and got to talk to people
which is what you should be doing I mean
everyone you should go up to people and
just start a conversation as simple as
that got to them make the first move
because they probably want to do it as
well they're probably as scared as you
are so if you just go make the first
move you never know what could happen
you could be friends you can hang out
but in terms of fitting in I don't think
you have to fit in I just think it's
important to kind of have like a few
friends that you can you know hang
around and share things with because I
think friendships are beautiful and yeah
so now we have the end of my question
and answers video let me know in the
comments what theme that question notes
that video you want to see next and I'll
be more than happy to get that done
sorry if you're in school right now just
enjoy it while it lasts because honestly
go so so quickly and then you have the
rest of your life ahead of you
I'm not using any qualifications that I
got while I was in high school but I'm
I'm still like really glad that I did it
because it's a really big accomplishment
in life and I think that it is a great
thing to graduate and just the feeling
of graduating is so relieving and it's
just so beautiful
and yeah I I didn't enjoy school but I
would say there was times where I did
not want to be there but in the end I'm
happy that I did it yeah I hope you guys
like this video hopefully you learned
something interesting and I will see you
a venue very soon bye guys love you mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
