sorry in today's video I just want to do
my makeup and chat to you guys because I
honestly haven't uploaded like one of
these type of years in the longest time
so I feel like we have a lot to catch up
on it feels so good to be sitting down
and filming again and I just like can't
help but notice how pale my face is
compared to my neck like its honestly
distracting me so much we need to figure
this out now sorry I am doing a few
exciting things today and oh my god
there goes a construction I'm really
sorry if you can hear that I'm just
gonna try and talk over it but um yes so
you're speaking of one of the exciting
things that I'm doing today I'm gonna go
look at a new place because that
construction is so annoying and the
place that I live in now is like
literally has no privacy at all so I
need to get something that's like heaps
more private and I want something for
the dogs like a nice backyard so I'm
really excited for that I'm gonna use a
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation
in the shade 6.5 as you can see my face
isn't looking the greatest at the moment
that's because I just went to Coachella
and my skin is actually hating me but
this foundation is so pretty especially
for like an everyday kind of look yeah I
just wanted to my makeup to the
inspection because I feel more confident
wearing makeup these days like what's
going on usually I can always leave the
house without makeup I mean I still do
about like I just feel so much more
confident when it's all covered up if I
actually get this house today I'm gonna
honestly vlog everything like the whole
moving-in process because I remember
when the first time I moved out I've
loved the process and looking back at
that is honestly so exciting and I know
lot of you people that watch this video
these videos are like kind of young so
I'd be cool to show you guys like the
whole moving out experience it's
definitely definitely not easy but I
love it I love just like reorganizing
everything and decluttering speaking of
decluttering there I did declutter my
whole house yesterday well yeah the
whole day I was decluttering and like
you know film a video today and then I
walked into my fielding room and I'm
like
my god no I need to declutter my life
before I actually sit down and film
because I have this weird thing where
like if my house clothes makeup anything
is messy
my mind is messy it's really strange but
like I just had to do it so I'm glad
that's all done I did go to look at a
house yesterday and it was across the
road from a cemetery and I literally
message the person that was supposed to
show me and I was like don't even bother
about coming and wasting your time
because like the house next door as well
had construction and I was like that's
why I'm moving like why would they just
like I'm obviously they're not gonna
advertise that but like it was just
annoying because I drove all the way
there I was like oh my god with a really
weird rash on my neck I don't know
what's going on moving on to concealer
I'm gonna take this one from Becca
it is the aqua luminous perfecting
concealer I love this one so much it's
like super hydrating as well so it's
like really easy to blend at okay sorry
let's talk about Coachella
because I didn't really get to vlog too
much and let me tell you why if you
haven't watched my cartel vlog I will
leave that in the description below so
you guys can watch it I personally think
it's like the coolest video that I've
uploaded so I feel like you guys should
go check that out but I did want to look
more and like actually talk more in it
but let me tell you what happened from
the beginning okay so on the first day I
was like I don't know what to expect at
all I don't know if I can take my
cameras in like I'm just gonna go and
just like test all out I took my little
camera it was all good I started filming
like I started vlogging and everything
and then we walk into the gay and the
lady's like sorry you contact this
camera and it has a detachable lens and
I said sorry I took this camera in
yesterday please tell me what's going on
here like I actually took that camera in
yesterday like why can I not take it in
now like this is actually annoying I
need to vlog everything I need to
sheriff ain't with you guys and she's
like well you can't take it in and I was
like okay
I just drove two hours to get here
sir what am i safe today Lipari pada and
she's like I don't know you just can't
take it in so I was like ok so then
this guy walked in and I recognized him
from YouTube and he goes do you want me
to put the camera in my car and I'm
thinking well if it was a random I'd be
like excuse me go away like stop talking
but because I like kind of knew of him
online I was like okay well I know that
he's not gonna like steal it because I
mean if he does like I'm sorry but
everyone's gonna find out and I just
like I don't know I just like knew he
wouldn't steal it so I was like okay
well he's gonna have to take the camera
go put it in his car and I was like
like what am I supposed to feel now like
I'm so annoyed okay I can I'm gonna take
the estrela's Thresh influence pad ah
I ain't oh my god it's like fully fallen
upon oh I'm gonna take this new Real
Techniques brush by the way it's like
really really stuff like I don't think
you guys understand I need to a new
paddle um so yeah whatever I just go in
and look at my phone I'm like this is
the worst like I literally don't want to
put up shitty content like that's all
blurry like I hate this so annoying so I
kind of just did what I could do with my
iPhone and then I get a message from the
guy that I gave the camera to and said
my car got broken into and the first
thing I thought was mm-hmm
did you a car get broken into or did you
just steal my two thousand dollar camera
but I still the next day that he went to
like the police station and everything
and it was so good and it was really
nice about it like he kept apologizing
and I was like hey okay maybe maybe he
actually did get broken into and he said
that he got all this stuff stolen from
him sir Oh
Zack whatever I have travel insurance
anyway I'll try and get it back so
hopefully I can get my camera back
because it was $2,000 and I'm annoyed
okay by the way I'm taking this Gobbo
and Kelly
brow powder
it's not looking too good the next thing
that I'm gonna do is take this hourglass
arch brow shaping gel this is a new one
I'm actually excited to use this one I'm
gonna push my eyebrows upwards oh I
really like this fully in this it gets
in all those little brow hairs that's
amazing I feel so much better over the
foundation I'm like this is not like me
what's going on oh my god and guys I'm
going somewhere really exciting next
week like you're going to die when you
see where I'm going
I will let you know when to light a
video because you know I've been
traveling so much you guys need to just
like just watch my videos when I'm at
home and we can just chill and then we
can go traveling again because I'm
obviously gonna be vlogging and
Michael's coming with me and literally
they're like my favorite figures to film
when I'm with Michael because I can I
can honestly just put the camera on him
and he'll say something so stupid and it
is just the funniest thing in the world
like he is hilarious I was talking to
this girl from high school that
galloping my benefit this is literally
like the best mascara in the world like
I'm not even kidding
um oh speaking to like a few people from
like when I was growing off and it just
like makes me think like how easy it is
to grow apart from people like I have so
many friends that I used to have oh my
gosh my tan oh sorry huh look at that
let me come at it Christ that it was
like so many really close friends I used
to have an H to spend like every single
day with them and now I literally like
hardly talked to them
like it's actually insane to make sure
everyone you put in effort with people
that you want in your life make sure
you're there for them because honestly
I've had my fair share of shitty friends
and I'm just I'm very happy with who I
have in my life at the moment I'm like
very picky with my friends like if if I
have a really close friend I'm like 100%
there for them that 100 was sent there
for me and if they show that they like
don't care or anything I'm just like
literally goodbye like I have no time
for people like that okay so let's move
on to the bronzer I've been using this
one for like a month now I'm honestly
holy crap I'm obsessed with that I don't
even know if I've spoken about it before
on my channel bye
it is in muck bronzing powder in refine
golden it is just so pretty and oh my
god you guys need to try it out um so
I'm gonna put that on my cheek burn so
it's shiny
I want to have one lap right on my
crutch other experience because if there
was one paw
actually I didn't I mean I didn't really
look that much so like let me just
explain to you what happened so on this
second day John got a message and was
like do you guys want to come to an
after-party and like Coachella literally
ends at like 12 o'clock and like the
Australian it's like we don't want to go
to bed at 12 o'clock and like we'd got
there like pretty late everyday so we
got there at like 6 o'clock so obviously
we wanted to like keep partying or by
the time I got to 12 like I remember on
the second day Beyonce was playing in oh
my god she was honestly incredible like
I remember like me and my friend Liv
were just like oh my god this is like a
moment for us we need just dance enjoy
the shower because the amount of girl
power vibe she was giving us I was like
boy bye like she was amazing so
obviously like after that we'll show
pumped so we decided to go to that
after-party and it was literally the
weirdest thing like I don't know what it
is with like American music but it's
just like a constant base like there's
no like there's no words I'm pretty sure
this style of the music was called EDM
and I mean like it was good for like
when I was drunk but then I started
serving up and I'm like okay seriously
they need to put some like armed Bay on
or something because I've had just about
enough but it was just like the way to
sing we like rock top we had to pay $40
and like obviously you've got to be over
21 to drink all those rushes a bad and
my friend Louie was not 21 so I was like
sorry like my friend's not 21 come he's
still getting in like what's going on
and like okay that's fine like you can
go in so he went in and it was like a
whole bar there like it was like a
full-on festival at like this random
little shack thing I was like the
weirdest thing all of my actual life by
the way the blush that I use was the
Evan decay after glory video my face is
so dry at the remove you really need to
put some like doing this on it so this
is the touch shower luminous dewy skin
mist
I'm scared this is gonna leave like
white
to my face that left so many white dots
and helps and help oh my god sent so
much coke that's actually known okay now
it is time for the highlight so I'm
gonna go in with the Bobbi Brown pink
glow highlighting powder this one is so
stunning put this on the highest points
in my face and that's amazing I set um I
mean I put that Joey skin mess on as
well so the highlight had something
until I called on to that's a little bit
wet so this is a great tip oh God
oh it's my eyeball oh my god so because
I've been traveling so much like
literally so much I went to mecklen
which was like six meetups in three days
which was like crazy
yeah but as well saying cuz I've been
traveling so much my skin is literally
star dry I went for a facial like a few
weeks ago
and the lady was like hon your skin is
literally peeling off if I touch it like
you need to seriously step up your
skincare routine you need to hydrate
your face so much more because it's
flaking away and I was like oh okay so
let's move on through the lips I'm gonna
go in with eg way long wear lip liner in
this shade of fawn I'm just I mean
usually I don't wear lipstick bar
I feel like weird without it right now
so I'm gonna leave my lip balm on there
and just lend my good excuse me my lips
you know why but I love putting
foundation on your lips cuz my people
it's just soy pink fine sure when I went
to America last week I was alone like
Rodeo Drive and I was like oh my god
those Sephora send help so I went in
there and went shopping what a bit crazy
I mean not really because I swear I do
have most of the things in Sephora but I
found this brand that isn't in Australia
I don't think it's called by beauty and
I got this lipstick in the shade
honeycomb I'm trying to find like the
perfect nude not too Brown not too pink
but that's still really light and it's
honestly like the hardest mission of my
life I'm not gonna lie but this one is
really pretty it kind of smells like
mint that I like I don't I don't write
that okay so I'm just gonna do my lower
lashes and then I'll be back okay
so I just fixed my hair
I have my little strings out and my
hoops on I feel like I'm gonna be the
only one wearing hoops for the rest of
my life like literally I have been
wearing these for like I mean oh these
specific ones because I always get
really gross but I mean right here so
like true use now I can't speak properly
and I can like never get over them Oh
what the dog balls that's not okay
anyways I'm gonna set my face again
because it still looks dry because my
skin is so dry oh my god even like come
up so you can't see the roots of my hair
yes sir this is the Urban Decay cooling
and hydrating this one doesn't leave any
dots so a quick question before I go I
really really really want you guys to
leave a comment down below leaving what
video you guys want me to film what
videos you want me to film because I'm
honestly really confused with what you
guys want to see like some people save
vlogs some people take makeup videos do
you want to see challenges do you want
to see personal videos do you wanna see
non-personal like literally let me know
any ideas you have down below and I will
do all of them I'm so happy to be back
filming it honestly feels amazing I felt
like a piece of my life was like missing
when I wasn't working like whenever
would you call it working when I wasn't
uploading sure it feels good I'm feeling
so happy I'm gonna go have a V now it's
probably not a good thing to say because
these are really bad for you but like I
love the taste of these during phase one
D
anyways I love you guys it's so so much
and I'll see you in my next video which
will be a very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
