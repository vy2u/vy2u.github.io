long time but I feel like there's a lot
of stuff that we all need to catch up on
sir I'm at Michael's right now I had a
sleepover here last night um peanut is
the most clean tone I've ever met and I
wrote actually know I love it so yeah

meeting really soon so I'm gonna have to
get up and have a breaking sir I can't
go there but it's something really
really exciting but we'll find out soon
you can't just hide from my vlog forever

even a surprise because you came with me
wait I think the ads out because people
keep commenting on my video and their
lack like oh my god you're on TV and I
was like am I cuz I didn't even know it

from behind the scenes I know I pants so
excited for me looking at me with these
legs oh my god places if I talk in the
back how many toxic clothes like get
that yeah oh my god you'll see grass up
all these legs sorry if you guys didn't
know actually you get a secret but me
and Michael went to was it's Anil Melvin
Melvin for the day but yeah it's a melon
for the day and I brought him along with
me something I don't want to give on
myself and most shooting an ad for
Rimmel and Kenneth sweat house and you
let contour stick and it was so much fun
it was so different to what I usually do
and adds finally out sir I'm gonna try
and find a new shape and we can watch it
but I know they'd be on there Michael
literally has a tea cup with bindi on it
he's so obsessed Ben is that a couple
years but I I don't know which I think I
let Ben choose my pin shoes I think she
likes the rap better yes he on the right
okay
Oh bless she gets so excited I think
that's a bit more tagging Toya but
that's fine okay so I'm just about to go
to breakfast with Michael but just
quickly I really wanted to show you
these contour sticks by Rimmel and I
want to talk about my experience with
the ad because it was honestly it's so
freakin cool
okay sorry it is called the Rimmel
inside you or contour stick there's
three different shades here and I use
the shade medium so this one is honestly
so easy to use it's really creamy and it
blends out beautifully so I'm just gonna
contour my face I just want to do like a
really quick and easy look today so I
thought this would be like the perfect
day to use it so when I did the ad I was
so nervous
everyone was really nice but oh my god I
was so nervous or when I was like
drawing on the the contour like this I
like it I was like and I did like two
massive lines here oh my god I was just
like I was supposed to get it sounds
like oh my god I can't even draw a
straight line find out we did it a few
times and it was fine by the end bah I
couldn't even draw a straight line like
it was oh it's just a mess so go ahead
and blend this with my Beauty Blender if
you do see me on TV let me know I
haven't seen it yet so I'm excited like
if I'm watching TV and it pops off I'm
just gonna be like hold my god - look
how nicely that blends out absolutely
beautiful
look laughs - laughs okay sir I'm gonna
go with the highlights aside and I'm
just gonna put it on the back of my
Beauty Blender and then we're going to
put it on the high points of my cheeks
so you can see right there oh
oh no but I didn't even do you can see
lie oh I'm feeling so good okay so
lastly I'm just gonna go in with the
rimmel rimmel
insta-fix and go to in one primer and
it's setting spray I'm gonna use this as
a setting spray this is actually a new
bottle gonna get my white a bit on my
channel where is it oh it smells sorry
but it actually smells like you come is
how do I drink it after myself a nice
camel latte and what is that so it's
disgusting okay with a little bit honey
it looks like water and water water
water
this is literally my favorite breakfast
to get we always come here what is this
oh my god okay sir I'm on my way to a
meeting right now
I'm so excited for this one I'm going
with beginning boutique to discuss a few
things but I'm actually going to kertel
with beginning of your take I'm so
excited it's gonna be insane I'll
actually flog that as well but I feel
like I haven't even really looked
recently like where have I been
I fell off the face of the earth I just
kind of needed to like take a step back
from social media and all and also
YouTube I don't know it was just like
I'm just like I was live doing like the
same type of videos like I like I love
doing makeup but I think I'm gonna step
back from doing makeup a little bit and
do like more vlogs and stuff I feel like
you guys enjoy like local small anyway
so let me know what you want temple or
and obviously I'm still gonna be doing
makeup but I feel like I need to just
like sit down and really practice makeup
because I don't want to do just like a
16-0 I think the main reason why I can
be uploading cuz I think I've had a
chest infection I completely explode by
that after my 21st I got started seeing
because I cared about was drinking way
too much like it was a really a jerk but
I mean it's my 21st when he makes it so
yeah I've been on antibiotics electri
weeks and I feel so good now I went and
got like a beast shot b12 shot vitamin C
infusion I wish the doctors and they're
like who's doing that for you and I was
like I'm like doctor like my nurse I
don't know I don't know just go to some
random place and she's like that's
really dangerous you shouldn't be doing
that and I was like well I feel good
after and it's a nurse doing it so it's
fine baby
okay so just finished up the meeting it
went really really well other than the
fact that I actually got a letter on my
car saying you cannot Park here this is
the paying customers only
you know the plate has been taken down
yeah well my car was still there I
didn't get a ticket so I'm pretty happy
with that and then I also got heaps of
clothes as well yeah heaps of clothes
for Coachella
it's gonna be so much fun but go until
we can true though because I have other
work commitments that we can one sort of
I mean suddenly came one yeah we can do
I'm so excited they have the same like
people playing anyway so that's a little
good she has a red hat so cool it's like
full-on red
oh my god I have to show you guys a new
prints that I picked up they're so
pretty
we have these three right here it
literally took them three months to come
but sorry worth it look how beautiful
they are
one two three
your mind is a powerful thing when you
fill it with positive thoughts your life
will start to change how inspirational
and then in my filming room you have
these two as well it was my friend's
21st I go to balloons I got this one too
do you like it P you're being very lazy
today little boy my mommy's been working
yes what have you been doing oh that was
cute that is probably the saddest thing
I've ever seen and so is that I was
actually cutting my way yesterday so it
look natural
because for Kurt Chawla I really really
wanted to wear a week because uhm I want
to do something like different
hey guys ready for this
Alex are saying I cut like a little
fringe I feel like I'm a hairdresser at
this point I just got lunch I got some
veggies and a chicken and rice bowl I
don't know but it is Japanese and it's
bloody good but quick side note if you
guys feeling very unorganized recently
or like ever then I would definitely
recommend getting at a diary honestly
this is the best thing that I've ever
done like any little thing that I need
to do like literally anything even if
I'm seeing a friend or if I want to go
to gym or like whatever work commitments
I have I write them all down and once
I've done them I highlight them so I
know that they're done I can move on to
the next thing but honestly it's changed
my life
I just really quickly wanted to say that
because I don't be without that diary
honestly I'm just excited okay sir I
just took my makeup off and finished up
all of my work now I'm just going for a
little walk with the dogs because since
I live in an apartment I've got to take
math walks quite a bit because otherwise
I'll lose their actual mind so just
listening to some music and walking up
by the river
Brisbane is so beautiful yeah that's
just very peaceful just having a bit of
um you know inner social media time just
listening to music and chemists oh my
god I need to tell you something really
embarrassing it just happens so I was
cooling my friend like one face time to
talk to her and he literally cooled like
I've read number on FaceTime saved under
her name and I was like oh I can pull
her from like a dad woods angle like
this
and she's like like it wasn't really on
her face but it kind of looked like her
and she's like dude you've got the wrong
number and I'll say oh I kind of thought
she was joking so I was like what and
then I realized it's not fair I was like
oh my god I'm ditch like you're not
believe I just happened like that's my
worst nightmare I was like ah sorry
hyung often in my food be like I don't
know why I saved her number under Olivia
is it's not Olivia

talking to her because we are rekindling
our friendship after like five years of
