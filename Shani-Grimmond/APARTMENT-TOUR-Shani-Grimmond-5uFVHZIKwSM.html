my channel I'm finally doing my
apartment - ah I have been living here
for about two months now so I finally
settled in for those who don't know I
live with my good friend Courtney she's
at work at the moment she actually works
from like really early morning to the
afternoon so I have the house to myself
like all day long
yes so I wouldn't say that this
apartment is like extremely like
decorated because it's really not
there's only like a few pieces of
furniture here and there that's just
what me and Courtney like I was looking
up someone else's apartment - and it was
really colorful and there was just like
beautiful decorated things everywhere
and I was like oh my god mine isn't look
so boring so if you want some creative
ideas this is not the video for you
trust me because I'm not creative at all
my makeup room which is this one right
here is the only thing that I'm
basically like in love with in the house
it's not like colorful and like exciting
so I just sort of let you know yeah I
think that's everything that I have to
say um if you guys are thinking of
moving out in getting an apartment or a
house it is honestly so amazing I just
wanted some privacy that's why I just
had to move out and it's just been like
the best decision that I've ever made
and I'm really happy with it so yeah I
hope you guys like this video and let's
jump straight into it so I'm just going
to very quickly run over the downstairs
part because that's quite boring but I
do want to get to my makeup room in my
room to talk in more detail so this is
what it looks like when you walk into
the door we have the garage right here
and then another carport behind me and
then over here we have my laundry so
just wash machine and then we have my
tripod whole is not working and we also
have a toilet over there so that's that
so this is our kitchen here I mean
there's not really much to say this is
what it looks like we've got our fruit
bowl they also have the stove and
everything like that
whoo so this is a dining table it's very
plain and white we love white and also
the rug on the bottom is from my old
house so thanks mom for the free rug I'm
thinking we need to add like a flower
bowl something like in the middle over
there and then to the left over here we
have the lounge area which again is
quite small just the TV and the sound
system and a lounge that's all we really
need yeah I think it's pretty cozy and I
enjoy watching TV over here we do need
to get a new cabinet as well because I
mean hello that's pretty really I mean
really what seventeen-year-old wants to
spend their money on a new TV and TV
thing like who cares let's just find
makeup instead so yeah that's pretty
much all for downstairs this is the
staircase to go up let's do this I've
fallen down these stairs a few times
already okay so this is the view coming
up the stairs so we have Kourtney's room
there my room at the bathroom and then
over here we have my makeup room so
let's go there first okay so this is
what my makeup room looks like here I
have this massive window so I use
natural lighting when I film and then I
also have my studio lights over here so
this is where I film all of my videos
right here as you guys would know the
background is quite familiar right here
I have my little acrylic drawers that
rimmel sent me along with all the makeup
inside it because I'm doing a collab
with them very soon for their channel
and then up here we have all of my
makeup brushes I just chucked out all of
my really old makeup brushes so I've
only got a few up there um all of the
containers are from like the reject shop
and stuff like that except for this one
right here that is from zoeva so I just
keep my big brushes in here and then I
keep my eyeshadow brushes in this little
one right here which is really handy
because I don't have to go digging in
these ones for my eyeshadow brushes so I
have my iMac right here I hardly ever
use it because it's really slow I guess
because of intense so many videos on
that so I just use my little MacBook Pro
which is down there and then I have my
vows which is from Kmart and then all my
flowers inside of it which are from
Sam's warehouse and my little jewelry
box down here that is from Spolin
so these drawers right here from Ikea I
have the 9 set full of Alex drawers and
so the six set and then just the desk
that goes across and as well as the
chair that's from Ikea as well so right
here I have my perfume collection so I
have my favorite one which is Lady
million Nicole Richie's is absolutely

is my first makeup drawer I will go in
depth when I do a makeup collection

little tray from reject shop all my
foundations my beauty blunders and my
primers and my second drawer I have my
eyeliners at the back I have my eyebrow
products my concealers and my mascara so

of random stuff I have a pair of
eyelashes for some reason I've got stuff
down here which I regret buying or
empties that I'm going to talk about in
another video and I have a few facials
and random stuff in there and this is by
far my favorite drawer so I have my
acrylic lipstick holders from eBay and I
have all of my favorite lipsticks in
there I have my lip liners and then some
lip glosses and then more lip glosses
and lipsticks definitely my favorite
drawer by far and the next rule is also
one of my favorites as well so I have
all my eyeshadow palettes right here I
have my full ones down yeah and then all
of my really long ones just stacked up
and then at the back I've just got some
lipsticks that I never use so I just
hide them back there and next we have
all of my self tanning stuff so I've got

sanctuary pay and also my brand is that

is really cluttered and I need to sort
out pronto so in the first drawer here I

this drawer I just have a bunch of my
sunglasses yes I do have quite a large
collection I am a freak and then lastly
I just have my phone cases and a few
other random things in there so leaving
my makeup room we go straight down the
hall which is my room so to the left
over here I have my plant from Kmart and
then I have my little stool from Kmart
as well my bed frame is from super a
mart my bed covers I'll actually have no
idea where that's from I have my little
silk pillowcases over here which are so
comfortable to sleep on it there from
spotlit so here is my cupboard I'm
actually blending into it and don't mind
my back it's really wide I forgot to
turn it oh well so to the left over here
I have all of my sportswear so all of my
sports bras and my pants and everything
for the gym and then I have my pajamas

clothes I try to look I try to keep them
sorted but I mean it gets messy
sometimes and then at the top I have all
of my swimwear back there my undies my
bras my socks and my pajamas and then on
this side I have all of my winter wear
that I'm probably not going to wear for
a while because it's still really really
hot so you got all my coach and my
