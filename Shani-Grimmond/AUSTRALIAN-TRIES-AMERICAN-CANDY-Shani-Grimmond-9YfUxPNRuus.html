my channel I am so excited to be doing
this video today because it involves me
eating chocolate and lollies that I've
never tried before which is something
that really interests me I love
chocolate and believes I'm probably
going to feel sick after this but it's
worth it so I'm trying an American candy
I'm Australian so I haven't tried any of
these except one thing so I got these
things from Joy's delight I will link
their social media links down below and
their website working by their chocolate
emily's and yes let's go ahead and get
started
oh my god first things first I'm trying
the Hershey's cookies and cream oh my
god it says how many calories are on the
back Oh 220 calories in this okay okay
hmm nah it's white chocolate okay so I
would say that that tastes like an Oreo
like exactly the same as an Oreo in a
chocolate bar form I don't like white
chocolate and I can really taste the
white chocolate okay I'm gonna get the
white chocolate out of the way because I
know I'm not gonna like it so this is
the KitKat white crisp wafers and cream
not as good as a normal chocolate
kick-ass okay so oh I fell tell you what
this is
it's the Tabasco chocolate oh my god
spicy chocolate you know I'm so picky
when it comes to chocolate
what that calls for a water break it's
like burning my throat that's how hot it
is I feel like my dad will like that one
because he likes hot things but their
luck so far
oh my god these are the Russell's then
gone I freaking love gum it's gonna
taste good
razzle dazzle in my puzzle how do you
open it have you proven it oh well so
they're like all colorful and they have
flavors like grape and raspberry so I
want to get raspberry looks like this
kind of weed it's like really hard but
then when you chew on to where it turns
into a thumb and get stopped 15 calories
in each one that's like me right on the
treadmill for lack a minute not worth it
just get so worth it mmm tastes a bit
like dishwashing detergent you're not
that over the toaster that before but my
mouth is watering it's so much right now
a little look okay next thing I have our
milk tubs made with chocolate and camel
oh my god
that sounds it's so YUM they're like
little blobs
of goat food but what the hell they're
like squishy hmm it's like a mouse bar
it's just like chocolate with caramel in
the middle feels like a month by without
the mousse definitely keeping these ones
it's really chewy and I can't chew it
mmm next thing we have are the Jelly
Belly draft beer it's non-alcoholic but
it's beer flavor okay oh my god
it smells like dirty feet you would ever
taste like Apple and dirty feet uh-huh
I'm so excited for these ones this is
the mmm I mean the M&amp;amp;M peanut butter it
tastes like a Reese's look exactly the
same
how's the Reese's these are really good
except I'll probably prefer just Reese's
so taste better or just like plain M&amp;amp;Ms
next we have the Hershey's Kisses milk
chocolate love me a little bit of
chocolate mmm tastes like off milk but
I'm so picky
I'm like saying bad things about every
single one and it smells out juice next
thing we have are the sugar free oh my
god you lost me at sugar free because I
love sugar
the icebreakers sour green apple
watermelon tangerine holy this has it
I'm a sour this has so much flavor in it
hmm it tastes so good I'm putting this
in my handbag oh this is a taffy hmm
really laughs it kind of tastes like
toffee or caramel something hmm
next thing I'm trying is a tootsie roll
papa good don't see in there like a bump
and sub T so random ah
it's just like a chewy chocolate caramel
how'd it taste if you like licorice next
thing that I have here is the tic tac
Agito mint so yeah okay I like it on
multi tax on in the orange oh it tastes
so good yeah I don't like mint and this
is mint okay so these things are legit
my favorite chocolate of my life I have
had them so many times they called the
races and I've got the cupcake style so
it's like a little cupcake you guys have
never seen it and then it's got like
chocolate on the outside peanut butter
in the inside I don't really like peanut
butter that much like I have on my toast
and stuff but laughs I'm not a huge fan
of it but woah this is another level
well just read out the stairs okay so
the next thing is the dr. pepper soft
drink is it peppery I have no idea mmm
that legit tastes like medicine I will
never lay my lips on that drink ever
I thought would be something like
raspberry or like like creamy soda or
something so last thing they have here
are the bean boozled jelly beans so for
example you have a good jelly bean and a
bad jelly bean so you have peach or you
get barf or you get like berry blue or
toothpaste it's so disgusting
I'm gonna hold video on it so I will
link that down below I did it with Chloe
it was the funniest thing ever and so
yeah go check that out
I'm not going to eat these because to be
honest I'm not going to put myself
through that if I've already done it so
yeah if you guys want this just write in
the comments beanBoozled and I will send
it out wow I just ate a lot of chocolate
Ollie's I don't really feel very well um
so yeah I didn't really like many things
but that's just typical for me because
I'm really really fussy so I'm sure you
guys will like this stuff like I'm just
really picky but anyways I hope you guys
like this video and if you did please
give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel for more videos and I'll see
you very soon bye okay well I like
tampons better just because it feels
like you literally don't have your
period obviously after the tampons up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
