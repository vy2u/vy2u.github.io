a part of comments on my first log so I
woke up pretty early yeah so I've been

was going to go back to sleep but I'm
Way too hungry to sleep so I think we're
just going to go to like the cafe that's
in this villa and grab some food so

have this top from valley girl and then
these pants are from butter and I love
it I love summer fashion or spring
fashion so easy to make anything look

a new phone this is the iPhone 6s plus I
bought the really big one because I'm
always on my phone and you watch youtube
videos really big with it and Netflix oh
let's go to breakfast good breakfast I
think it's like a buffet hold on me
so having bacon and eggs on toast little
bit I thought I would be a bit healthy
and grab some fruit as well I've been
really getting into the Graham lately

good pics by the pool

clothes to you that I got a little
dress-up show the first thing I got is
this place suit jumpsuit thing it has
like a lot of dick space right here it's

shirts all night you bloody bran boy and
I also got the same thing in a different
color I'm like really feeling is barley
but obviously what these are soren come

gonna keep them for myself and then go
buy house more because I freaking love
them how adorable are they and the
high-waisted and I love everything how
wasted over here we have everything else

pair I think they're what brand are they
are these are these space I'm not too
sure but I love the rainbow effect we

another pair these are really different
the style so I thought I'd get them to
start a new trend just kidding they're
really cute from a side they look good
like this
some side photos but from the front they
look a bit like grandma editor but then

beautiful I honestly don't think I can
do this that is so creepy and if you
look your legs up they stick something
to it or do it yes what see Jonathan and
I were just sitting here chilling
because I had a belly ache and I thought
I had Bolly belly so I was like hey
let's go home and just chill out and it
all of a sudden I heard a yeah and then
we just ignored it and then like five
seconds later I was like wait I just had
a male he's like oh you heard that too
and they were like what the hell and we
looked outside and there's a freaking
wild cat sitting on our um little bed
thing can you see it because if I see
I'll my pants don't open the door
murder has been yeah yeah I know that's
what I think it's gonna do I feel like
it's just gonna come up to the screen
bit okay
story time so I was at the Marcus just
before and it's like a massive tent full
with different little stores and I
thought all the stores were like joined
together but that will like individual
so I went to one store I picked up a few
things went over to the next one and I
was still holding the other person's
stuff so I bought stuff from the second
store went back to the first one I think
she thought I stole something I still
had everything in my hand and I was like
okay so how much for this jumpsuit and
she's like 20,000
thousands of $20 here and like all nerd
that's to be said soon so we went to put
it put it back and then as I was putting
it back she like punch my hand and then
all the clothes fell on the ground and I
was like what the hell and she was like
yelling and I freaked out and she ran
over somebody yelling out something I
don't know what she was saying I don't
know why she got angry but it was really
scary but I did buy a lot more things at
the markets that I'll probably shared
you guys another day because I really
showed you so many things today I just
got more high-waisted pants and Sony's
and stuff literally this is my dinner
it's a dessert druvan got a burger and
what's that chicken wings and I'm scared
to be out here what if the cat starts
like attacking or something I can't see
it there so my dessert didn't go as well
as I thought I don't really like it and
I'm not hungry anyway so it doesn't
matter so I'm I'm just going to wipe
this fat chicken wing to finish these
chicken wings and then we're gonna grill
it so I hope you guys liked today's
