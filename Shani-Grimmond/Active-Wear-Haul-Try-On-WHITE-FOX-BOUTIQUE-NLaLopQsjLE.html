so in today's video I'm gonna be doing a
a white fox booty call they just came
out with that white fox active so a heap
of gym wear which I'm super excited
about because that's literally all I
live in even if I'm not going to work
out so just recently I started up to the
gym which I'm so happy about because
ever since I started I've been in the
most happy mood ever I just think
working out makes you so incredibly
happy and everything just turns good
when you feel better so yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and show you all the pieces
that I picked up they are amazing but
when your look sad so I will leave
everything at that I'm gonna be talking
about in the description below the first
thing that I want to say is everything
that I've picked out in this video is
high-waisted and it's super high waisted
so it really does go past the belly
button which for me is so amazing I love
anything high-waisted and it just feels
more comfortable and everything's kind
of like tucked in so let's start with
the first set so this is what it looks
like right here this one is the maroon
one so it says WFA and then it has like
a few lines down the side he also it has
the zipper at the back as well and then
it says white fox active at the back but
honestly this quality is insane I'm
gonna be living in these workout clothes
the fabric is definitely breathable but
it's not true thin and it's not too
thick so I'm really really happy with
that and then we have the sports brother
that comes with right here and we need
to try them all on they felt really good
on the boobs like you have really nice
support and all of that so this one is
maroon with the black around like the
trims and then it says white fox active
on the back as well but I was just
really impressed with like how they fit
it around my boobs fit it bit my bad
till so I got a size small and
everything if you guys were wondering
and I have a size D boobs and a small
still fits and keeps it all sucked in so
I'm really happy about that okay this is
by far my favorites that it's amazing so
this one is like a bright red and it
says a white fox active on the back
straps on the back and this one does
criss cross over as well but this color
is honestly everything it's literally
like the perfect red and for me
personally I like to a really nice tan
this looks a bomb then again like
every time I go to the gym I tense
itself so it's like whatever why am i
right sorry this is what the photos look
like right here this one has like scenes
around the butt cheeks right here I
don't know if that's an illusion for a
bigger butt but I feel like when I wear
it it creates a really nice like bubble
but illusions amazing I'm going to show
me it's there for support but of course
I look at it that way so again this one
has a zipper at the back as well yeah
these ones go all the way down to the
ankles but yeah I love these see as you
can see they're very stretchy so they're
gonna be really comfortable when you're
working out and of course they're not
see-through at all and also this has
padding in the boob area as well the
padding is such good quality like that's
what I'm talking about I think I'm
actually gonna leave the padding in
there because it feels like a really
sturdy and you know when you put like
clothes in the wash and the padding kind
of get like gets twisted and stuff I
don't think that's going to happen there
but with a red I think I might lurk that
instead of put it in the normal wash
because I don't want a red to fade and
that's what you're supposed to do anyway
so like flatter next up we have this
turkey a nudie Brown kind of shade so
this is what the sports bra looks like
this one is actually they're all like
very different in that anyway so this
one has a cutout I hope someone's
listening to me film this one has a
cutout in the back like this it still is
a really great support and it says wife
looks active up here
and then it has these seams around the
cup area right here so I love that one
and then we have the bottoms as well
which looks like this again these ones
go all the way down to the ankles but I
think this colors really nice as well
it's like very different I've never seen
anything like this it's kind of like a
washed out pink is it yeah it's like a
pinky nude okay I'm not gonna lie I
literally live in workout gear so I know
what's good and what's not and this
stuff is honestly amazing like I'm
really shocked right now so this is the
next pair right here this one says a
white fox or white box all the way down
the leg in Y that's really cool cuz it
really stands out holy crap and then it
also has it on the other side as well
that's stunning and then this is the
sports bra that it comes with so again
this one has
the way Fox written on the back steps I
love this we can never go wrong with
like basic black and white okay yes this
is another one of my favorite so this is
a a long-sleeved crop and it has a white
horse written on the band like
underneath the boob and it is a really
nice breathable quality but it's still
definitely not see-through and then we
have the types that go with it so these
are like all the way down to the ankle
and they're super high waisted as well
but this one feels a little bit
different the material is a bit
different to the others I feel like it's
just I feel like this is something I'd
wear not so much to the gym but you
definitely could but whether it's like
most of the shops and stuff is this like
my type about when I go shopping okay
next we have short pants with a sports
bra sore again these months are high
waisted I guess you could fold them down
if you really wanted to like if you
don't want them high waisted so again we
have a zipper on the back and these just
come up below the birdie so we're not
gonna have any cheeks popping which is
you know nice and then this is the
sports bra right here so it says a
little bit of detailing on the back
which is really nice and it has that
logo on the bottom right here but that
is super supportive that comes up nice
and high around the boob to hold
everything in the lots of workout app
that we have is a nice rosy pink color
so again we have the logos on the back
with the crisscross strap that is really
nice and then we also have the tights
and this one has white fox written down
the sides of both legs once again wow
this color is really nice okay this is
totally up my alley so the next set that
we have I'm not gonna wear to the gym
this is something that I guess you could
just wear like around the house or me I
probably wear anywhere except clubbing
because I love just being comfortable so
this is what the parents look like right
here it's just like high-waisted
Trekkies with a black tie up strap right
there and then the hoodie looks like
this right here so this fits perfectly
around the torso area so you can just
see like a little bit of skin there so
it's not like too much belly hanging out
you know the main thing I love that oh
and this also has their logo right here
as well
I feel like this one had that logo when
I wear wear oh yeah down the bottom here
of course I had to get that same outfit
in the lack so this is what that looks
like again we have the white logo on the
side oh my god my nipple was like Milly
popping and then we have the hoodie
right here thank you
so yeah that we have the finished hole I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
this is like outfits that I genuinely
beware every single day without a doubt
so I'm so happy that I could team up
with you why folks Boutique I love you
so much I've been working with them for
so long and they just have the best
quality clothes and now they finally
have workout clothes like my life is
literally complete they thank you I'll
