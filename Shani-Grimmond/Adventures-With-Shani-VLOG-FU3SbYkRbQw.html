in a really long time so I thought I
drilled my day I am recovering from
being sick so don't mind me I'd have a
little coffee here and there I think all
the doctor said that I had a throat
infection so yeah recovering I've been
in bed since Tuesday I haven't really
moved at all I was supposed to go on a
cruise yesterday to Hamilton Island I
couldn't even go to that I had a feeling
that I would be coughing all night
keeping all the girls up with those
first two or three my friends and I I
don't want to do that and I don't want
to give them the flu or whatever this is
but it's exhausting so yeah I just woke
up it is 9 o'clock and I think we should
go to breakfast we'll go out for
breakfast get some food bindi say hello
Jomo people do you know you know when
you're really sick and you breathe
through your mouth and you get really
badly burned yeah and also I got my
eyebrows tattooed on
for those who don't follow me on
Instagram than you wouldn't know that
but I'm gonna do a video about it so
you're going to like see what happens
because I filmed a little bit of it as
well so I'm really excited to talk about
that because it's kind of like different
normani nobody not many people really
get their brows how do you do it but
yeah I love them so much I don't have to
fill them in which is very nice because
it took me so long to fill my brows in
before I got them done and also uneven
and messy so yeah
okay so just cuz I want to tell you
about my dream can you come stand here
because I don't don't state it I got um
bashed I don't know I think I was at a
club or something
Oh who's that Callens cleaning my
brother's coming at 4:00 today
hello Hey anyways so when I was sitting
on the table people kept crap to me
Bethy she's just like my brother ah
and that was fluffing me like this and I
was really scared because I thought they
were signed a boo-boo anyways in the
chasey mastery and I ran away from them
but I know I woke up really tense and I
pretty sure it's because I hadn't dream
that
got bashed well it wasn't really bad she
was getting slapped so he will just have
the weirdest dream I always remember my
dreams
bhindi do you want to go for a walk just
be patient
any good our ears back oh I have a
tongue close is that custard stream Oh
Taylor and then I have a fruit smoothie
and you're still waiting I'm so sorry
what's that scramble eggs sausages in
the scrambled eggs
Anthony's down here Benny you wrapped
around the pole you okay Oh
oh my god that breakfast was so real
good it's called cafe 63 if any of you
guys were wondering if there's a cafe
secure around you should definitely go
oh so good and the menu is huge but
bendy saw like a hundred dogs walking by
and when she sees dogs she gets really
weird and my goodness I'm really really
excited so she didn't really have a good
experience to do but Jonathan and my
brother won't sugar cable skiing so I
guess I'm just going to go along for the
ride because I don't want a very cable
skiing if you don't know what that is
you'll soon find out so I just chucked
on a little bit old foundation and
bronze eye mascara and my outfit that
I'm wearing is sports go and then these
are from runway to label I feel really
weird with like this bit of skin showing
because I don't really like skin showing
at all but car company
so we just got to the little um what's
it called whiteboarding damn thing I'll
show you what it looks like in a second
um but when I was walking up to go sit
with bindi to watch my brother in
Jonathan there's a fucking sign that
says no dogs
so after sit in the car now while
they're doing it I just put bindi under
her long lead and she's just running
around holding a green grass so I'll
show what it looks like it's like a big
old brown dam and it has like wires at
the top and it distracts every bitch
around anyway so the other day I got a
massive bag of makeup from the bomb and
I want to show you what they sent me so
no I honestly sent me so much so the
first thing is the nude oh my god I'm
not going to do like a haul but it's a
nude eyeshadow palette I got another
eyeshadow palette which has really
really nice colors in it some man's
walking by anyways this is what the
colors look like I'm so excited to use
this because I'm nice warm shades and
then I got like a bunch of liquid
lipsticks the highlighters and the
bronzes
blushes I won't forget everything so
thank you so much the bomb - just
quickly I'm going to talk about like um
a lot of people commenting on my last
video saying that I seem like I'm
getting boring and lack I'm not
motivated and all of this stuff and a
lot of hate on my last figure and I just
wanna kind of talk mm I sweated into the
damn oh my god so I like I have a
problem where I lack motivation all the
time and I was kind of like the last
month or so I've been trying to figure
out what it is and I have finally
figured out what it is and it's when I'm
alone I get really like drained I love
being around other people to really get
motivated and inspired and stuff and
recently because I'm being sick and I've
just been like staying at home and even
before that I wasn't as motivated as I
normally am it's cuz I was by myself and
I went on by myself I just get so
drained so at least now I know that
I need to just constantly be around
people and stuff to get happy and then
what I'm happy that I want to film
because what I'm not happy I don't want
to film because I don't want people wack
I don't want to be boring for you guys I
want to be happy and myself and stuff
haha they're all geared up ready to go
