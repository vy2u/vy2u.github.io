hey guys it's shiny and welcome back to
my channel so in today's video I'm going
to be talking you through all of my
traveling essentials so everything I
find that comes in handy when I go on
aeroplanes and stuff because I do travel
a lot and I do have a lot of traveling
coming up in the future and I'm so
excited oh my god just thinking about it
makes me so happy I love traveling so
much so I'm also going to share with you
a makeup idea as well most of the time I
don't wear makeup on planes just because
I find it really uncomfortable by just
for you guys that do want to wear makeup
I thought I would show you what I would
do if I was going to wear makeup so I'm
also going to share with you two outfit
ideas something really comfortable
because obviously you want to be comfy
on planes so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this video and let's jump straight into
the essentials so I'm not a brands girl
at all brands honestly don't mean
anything to me except one thing I
thought I want to splurge on one thing
because I travel a lot and I want a bag
that's cute and big so I got myself a
Leviton this is like one of the biggest
ones you can get and I think it's like
the staple one well I guess the most
popular one I just wanted something that
was good quality and that's going to
last me a long time so I did splurge on
this but honestly that's the only
designer thing that I have so the
weirdest thing I want to start with it
is a scarf I have to take guys every
time I travel because obviously on the
plane I'm going to sleep and I want this
over my face so no one sees me even when
it's hot I take a scarf because no one
needs to see me the most important thing
when I'm traveling is my iPad this is my
baby
so obviously when I'm flying I don't
wanna be bored so I use this for movies
and games so I want to share with you my
favorite app of the moment it's freakin
amazing I've been so obsessed with it
like really obsessed with it sighs
Jonathan we sit there like in silence
playing it for hours in a row so it's
called at best fiends so basically what
you do is you have to select more than
three little things I don't know what
these are called like flowers or
mushrooms all these little water drops
you have to select three at a time and
then you select them and then it kills
this little man up here so it's like
this bad guy and you've got to defeat
him and
him and you have these little bugs here
that grow and the higher level you get
these ones get stronger so it's easier
to kill this men up here I'm on level 39
and I'm stuck I've been stuck on this
for a while now but I also have it on my
phone as well I'm on mobile I think 32
so that's pretty much like 60 levels are
you doing bindi she's sitting like this
yeah it's a super fun game and it makes
time goes so much faster which is
exactly what you need when you're on a
plane so I will leave the link to the
game in the description box below if you
guys are interested it is so much fun
you guys have to try it out Oh next
essential are my headphones I love these
ones a wireless so these are the beats
Soler's I have the gold edition because
I'm literally so obsessed with gold it's
not even funny
I really wish MacBooks kind of gold I
know they do but only the small ones and
I need the big one yeah these are
amazing they're subtle quality the bass
in it are just like boom boom perfect
for movies and music when you're on the
plane and these last a really long time
as well next essential is moisturizer I
feel like you guys are going to think
I'm a bit weird for adding moisturizer
in my essentials but if I don't take
this my skin gets so flaky my tan gets
ruined my skin just gets itchy so
obviously I like to take something
that's super small like this this one is
my favorite moisturizer all year round
it is really moisturizing and it doesn't
feel true sticky at all so usually I get
this one in this size but this one's
really good as well
it is the Naturalis pour pour and this
is not sticky at all but this one
definitely is a lot more moisturizing so
definitely need a whole bowl whole
bottle of moisturizer know what that
accent was I have some more beauty
essentials here so the first one
obviously is roll-on I don't like to
take aerosol on planes because you've
got to take it out of a bag and put it
through the scanner and it's just much
easier to keep this in your bag and
don't have to take it out the next thing
that we have here is a portable perfume
so I don't like taking too much perfume
because some know sometimes they're
really strict and they take it off you
um and you can't take it overseas like
more than 100 mils I think it is so this
one is the black opium my favorite my
favorite perfume of all times if you
guys haven't smelt black opium by YSL go
smell oh it smells so good forget it so
yeah this is just like a little portable
perfume thing you can get these from
Sephora maybe like chemists warehouse
and stuff like that so you guys need to
own those ASAP because they come in
handy all the time and it's perfect for
clubbing as well and I also have my
chapstick night repair this one is so
incredibly moisturizing I love it so
much as I said before my skin gets super
dry so I always make sure to carry this
around everywhere I go next essentials
we have are some cameras I know this may
seem completely over the top but I do
take cameras everywhere I go just
because I like to document everything so
this one is the canon GX 7 this is the
one that i used to vlog so if i am
planning on vlogging on the trip that
i'm going on I definitely don't lis take
this and then we have the sony a5100
the Sun is more for selfies and just
like close-up photos and stuff this is
incredible so it just depends on what
kind of trip I'm going on I usually swap
up between these two otherwise I take
the camera that I'm filming on now for
photos because that has moves in quality
and then I have my Sigma lens to go with
that but I will leave the name of my
lens down below that's a lens that I
used to take my Instagram photos it's
honestly the best quality so yeah I do
take a lot of like cameras and stuff you
wonder why I need a huge bag we have it
to more essentials so this one is
obviously just a hair clip it's like
turtles from Wallace or something these
come in handy so much I hate wearing
hair ties because I get the biggest
headache because my hair super long so I
literally just put a big banner on the
top of my head and this is my life saver
the next and the last essential is my
yoga room this is my life I really wish
feels like a white or pink one or
something but I've got the blue one umm
it's Jonathan's so yeah this is just
like a portable speaker it's super loud
and I love getting ready to like music
so this always comes in handy obviously
I'm not gonna use this on the airplane
but when I do get to my destination I do
like to pop music because I love parties
wherever I go good quality this one last
time I was traveling I got spray tan all
over my Louie Vuitton so at least I know
it's mine because it's got like stains
all
okay so let's move on to dumb makeup for
the foundation today I'm taking the
Charlotte Tilbury light wonder this is a
really really light foundation it
doesn't feel heavy on the face at all it
just evens out your skin tone pretty
much and it makes your skin look amazing
and just like skin but a hundred times
data so this is nearly empty I'm so sad
I have the shade at 6 medium I'm just
going to pop this on my face I'm just
applying this with the makeup geek face
buffer brush this is super easy and
quick
I like sleep on my face so I could never
wear makeup on a plane you know a lot of
people do so I thought this might help
it still has a decent amount of coverage
but it definitely doesn't feel like you
have anything on your face at all it
just feels like you've got a moisturizer
on for concealer I'm just going to take
a really really small amount this is the
bare minerals bare skin concealer in the
shade light so I'm just going to put
this in my inner corners and a little
bit under my eye to get rid of that
purpley turn that we have actually under
there because we probably didn't get
enough sleep last night did we do you
hate when flights are at the most
inconvenient times like 4 a.m. in the
morning 5 a.m. oh kill me so as you can
see on this side it's definitely just
like open to my eye up and make me look
like a liquid sleep then to set that in
place I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte
powder this is super affordable I'm just
going to put this on a little fluffy
brush and set the concealer under my
eyes and also on my lid as well we're
not in that foundation to crease and I'm
also going to set the rest of my face
with that same powder just because
you're probably going to be leaning on
your face on the flat you know make sure
this kind of stays on this is such a
good powder brush because it's like dab
dab dab done so for my cheeks I'm just
going to add a little bit of color so I
think it would be good if you chose a
bronzer or a blush so just keep it
really simple I'm going to use a blush
today this is the Milani illuminating
face powder so I'm just going to put a
little bit of this on the apples of my
cheeks just add a little natural flush
back in
like this is such a pretty shade I may
go out any teasers more yeah love it
then for the brows I'm just going to
take my tint my brow by Astralis it's
literally just a brow gel I'm just going
to run that through really quickly just
so they sit up in the right place this
step literally takes 0.2 seconds
Vinh Khai mascara I'm just going to take
my the balm or what's your tightness
Cara I quickly top up if we clearly coat
my top and bottom lashes and then we're
nearly done and then lastly I'm just
going to finish off with my lip gloss
that I showed with you and my essentials
so that we have the makeup done I'm
going to give you guys a close-up of
what it looks like and then I'm going to
share with you my outfit
you
you
so that we have my travel essentials
makeup and outfit ideas I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a big thumbs up because
it helps me out so so much I love you so
much and I'll see you in my next video
