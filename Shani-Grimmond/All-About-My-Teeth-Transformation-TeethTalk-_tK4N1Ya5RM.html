channel so in today's video I'm finally
going to be talking about my teeth
transformation so everything about the
procedure was worth it and all that good
stuff so let's go ahead and get started
because I have a lot of juicy
information to share with you I'm so
sorry if I have lipstick on my teeth
throughout this video it's just it's
going to happen alright so let's
backtrack to about a month ago before I
got my teeth done that there was nothing
wrong with the appearance of my teeth
they looked fine I wasn't insecure about
them or anything like that but little
did I know that they'll all worn down
really thin they were literally about to
crack off if I had waited like an extra
year or two I there is no doubt that my
teeth would like just crack off because
they'll really weak and just not in a
very good state at all and I also
noticed that my two front teeth was
starting to come together kind of like
that like some sort of rabbit and I have
no idea why because I did take really
good care of them that was time to get a
bit see-through and I was like what is
going on man so basically most of that
is caused by me grinding my teeth which
I had no idea that I did before I went
to the dentist but I was informed that I
do that and I was really shocked so now
I wear a retainer to bed which basically
saves my teeth from falling out of my
head so because my teeth were in such a
bad state I needed some kind of
protection put over the top of them so I
thought why not just make them look
better in the same procedure so the
doctor slash dentist that transformed my
teeth is dr. Lazarus he is located in
Sydney and he's one of Australians
leading dentist he is absolutely amazing
so talented he's basically just a living
God I am not even kidding you so the
first step to this procedure was to go
to a impression so just go there and get
my teeth looked at x-rayed take photos
of them and all of that and I just told
him what I didn't like about my teeth
and what I wanted to be changed so I
told him that as a bug there's a bug in
my room it's not cute it's not cute what
so I basically told him that I didn't
like the gaps in my teeth I wanted them
to be nice and full because they were
quite small and nice and straight but
natural-looking at the same time because
nothing more I hate then teeth that look
fake so I went home and then came back
the next day and he had made a 3d smile
design so basically like a mold of what
my teeth were going to look like
after the procedure so that was really
good so we could just agree on the
finished look of them before actually
going through with it so I wasn't
sitting down in a chair not knowing what
they were going to look like that would
require a lot of trust and then the
procedure of composit me is started I
was so excited you have no idea I was
really containing myself there I was
just being very casual about it so
basically what composite veneers are is
like a glass and plastic material placed
on top of your teeth so it doesn't
damage your teeth and is reversible as
well so I think that's always good so
after I've watched a few episodes of How
I Met Your Mother
on the TV above me my teeth were done so
I looked in the mirror for the first
time and I was absolutely mind blown
this is something that I wanted like you
know when you're looking okay I can't
even describe it because I'm so excited
well so you know when you look in
magazines and you see someone with like
a perfect smile and you're like oh I
wish I had that smile that is exactly
what I was looking at in that point in
time and I was just so shocked because I
had no idea that someone could possibly
physically make your teeth look so
amazing oh so there's a few other things
that I want to cover regarding the cost
and did it hurt and all of that so it
didn't hurt it all basically I got two
needles at the start of the procedure
just right up in my gums and oh my god I
hate needles with a passion I'm
petrified of them like I fainted one
time I got a needle lipstick no and yeah
I was just horrified so when you put
them in it literally felt like someone
just gently pinched me it didn't hurt at
all so if I can do it then you can do it
trust me so yeah it didn't hurt at all
so now for the question everyone has
been asking it is how much were they and
if I told you how much mine were it
wouldn't really help estimate how much
yours would be because we all have
different teeth would probably get
different procedures would get different
amount of teeth done I only got six done
so it wouldn't really help if you guys
want to get a price or anything like
that all you have to do is message
doctor Lazarus and he'll just email you
with a price back and as easy as that um
I will say one thing though it is not
cheap it is quite expensive but it is
worth every single dime that you put
towards that because having a smile that
you're super comfy
with is Oh what more can you ask for so
after watching this video I don't want
you guys to feel like your teeth aren't
good enough because they are good enough
I just made this decision because it was
something that I wanted and it's
something that you can reverse back it
doesn't harm your teeth it's just
something that can make me feel so much
more confident and I think being
confident with your smile is so
important because smiling is beautiful
smiling is attractive and it should be
done more if you want to see an in-depth
video of me getting my teeth done you
can head over to dr. claw services
youtube channel he has a full-on video
about it I was in it and it was so much
fun because I was cameras and lights and
all of that fun stuff I had a really
good time by the way yeah he's also
going to making some more helpful videos
for people like you and me you and me so
yeah I'll leave his channel down below

I'm getting really excited I can't even
speak I'm sorry if you want to see
videos from dr. Lazarus some helpful
ones I'll leave a link in the
description box if you're watching this

to flush your teeth because every time I
floss them it feels like nothing's
happening like I'm just putting that
little bit of floss up there like what's
the point of it I don't I don't
understand anyways thank you so much dr.
