channel so in today's video I'm doing a
makeup haul everything that I'm gonna be
showing you today is from versa Beauty
calm it is basically an Australian
website that sells like international
makeup that is really hard to get a hold
of all these products that I'm about to
show you I have wanted for the longest
time so I'm really excited and let's
jump into it so let's start with
eyeshadow palettes the first one that I
picked up is these Smashbox full
exposure palette oh my god look at the
packaging it is so stunning it just
reflects off the light okay so there is
a row of matte shades in a row of sheer
shades I can't really say too much about
this palette because I haven't used it
yet the colors do seem a pretty
pigmented they're not like over-the-top
pigmented sorry this is like a really
nice neutrals palettes and I think it's
a very very pretty and I can't wait to
use it in a video moving on the next
eyeshadow palette that I picked up is
the lorac Pro palette this is in my
August favorites if you guys haven't
seen that I will link it down below
oh my gosh I've never loved and
eyeshadow palette this much in my entire
life if I have to have just one this
would be the palette that I would keep
so this has over of matte shades in a
row of shimmery shades they're very very
pigmented so so easy to blend the color
selection in this palette is absolutely
to die for and my favorite one is the
color sable it's kind of like a ready
brown shade and it's just so sorry
pigmented and then the shade of gold is
just like a true gold it's oh so yeah I
think I've talked about these products
enough now I will be doing a lot of
tutorials using this because it is like
my little baby and I freaking love it
the next I shadow palette that I picked
up is the Naked 3 palette I actually
already had this but it was fake and I
had no idea that it was fake until I got
this one because then I compared them
and I'm like oh how annoying this
palette has a really gorgeous color
selection it has nice of rosy pinks and
then it goes into golds and browns and
bronzes which is literally like the best
color combination of my life I'm really
excited to use this in a video because
the colors are literally spot-on they
are very pigmented but not as pigmented
as the lorac Pro palette but still
gorgeous and now moving on to blushes
the first one that I picked up is the
NARS blush in the shade and more this is
my first blush from NARS so I'm very
excited to add this to my collection
because it's just so pigmented and
creamy and buttery and oh my god I can't
I just can't
so this is like a rosy dusty deep kind
of pink shade which is I think very
unique and yeah I'm excited to try this
one out I also got the hard candy fox in
a box in the shade spicy and sweet I use
this in a tutorial and I'll have it
linked down below it is very very pretty
it has a bronzy shade and it has three
different shades of pink and when you
swirl it all together it's like the most
stunning blush so it doesn't smell I
thought it did yeah
and the last blush that I picked up is
the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush
in the shade at peaceful this is a very
pretty light pink with that gold specks
it is very creamy and pigmented and
buttery what my lord the next product is
like my absolute holy grail I love it so
much it's the Anastasio dip brow pomade
in the shade of dark brown I've been
using this since I got the package
literally haven't used anything else
it's kind of like a gel consistency so
if you want to change the shape of your
eyebrow completely this will do magical
things to your brows I've never used an
eyebrow product that works at this well
for my brows so if you guys are looking
for a new one this is amazing I used it
on my friends a few times and they're
like I need that now I'm ready I also
picked up two lipsticks and I'm not even
gonna try and pronounce that name I'll
just have it listed down below because I
suck at pronunciation the first one is
in the shade neon coral it is just a
gorgeous coral e pinky orangey red this
is extremely opaque very pigmented and
creamy and it's just a really really
nice formula the next one that I got is
in the shade lilac it's just a really
nice lilac II purple and it also has a
little bit of pink in it as well so it's
a lot more wearable than just a standard
purple lipstick so as you can see right
here it is very very opaque as well I
also picked up the Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation in the shade at
medium tan honey
wow this is the best foundation I've
used I know last month I said I loved
the chichi foundation and if like any
other mm-hmm this overtook her this is
so good if you have problems skin like
really bad acne or pimples or you just
want a very very full coverage
this will work wonders for you girl
the color is good the coverage is
amazing it lasts ages it doesn't get
oily like what more do you want
really I want to go to dinner tonight I
throw my god I'm gonna see if she won't
go to dinner
I can't I'm sorry my god hello Hillary
that's and I wake you up um I was just
wondering if you want to go to the
Indian restaurant to knowledge you
already fathered anyways back to the
makeup Hall
I also picked up the hard candy
glamoflauge heavy duty concealer oh no
that's not how you pronounce it I just
know it this is a extremely full
coverage concealer so if you want to
spot conceal and cover any pimples I'm
pretty sure this will do the job because
it is extremely thick and very very good
at covering things I also picked up the
Versa Beauty brushed it so there are
four synthetic brushes in here I like to
use these three for Foundation and this
one for concealer under my eyes and they
work very very well I would say that
these are duped to the Sigma kabuki
brushes next is some false eyelashes at
least and the bursar Beauty ones these
remind me a lot of the red cherry lashes
and just the style of them and the band
is really thin so that would be like
really easy to put on and we also have
some that makeup sponges I'm not a huge
fan of these because they're really hard
and when you wet them they don't get
really big like the normal Beauty
blenders um I didn't like them so I
tried to do the ombre nail effect that
didn't work and the last thing that I
got is the EOS lip balm this is the amid
scent and it smells like medicated gums
it's very moisturizing on the lips but
I'm not a huge fan of the smell okay so
there is one item in this video that is
not from a boaster beauty this one is
from bag ink it is a bag that I've been
using for the last two months non-stop
the only one that I've been using and
that is dunked on so on this bag right
here it looks a lot like the saline bag
but I don't have
money to buy a slingback so I got this
one instead it has a really nice
snakeskin feel to it it is extremely
good quality it has a zipper at the
front and then chews it is inside and
it's black so it matches every single
outfit so yeah I'll leave a link to
bagging comment down below so you guys
can check them out literally the best
bag so there we have it my makeup haul
is complete I hope you guys enjoyed it
and make sure you go check out Versa
Beauty the last time that I went in
there it said that it won't be open
until the 16th so ten days from now you
can go ahead and buy some stuff so I
guess you have time to start saving
anywho I hope you guys enjoy this video

absolute world to me and it helps me out
