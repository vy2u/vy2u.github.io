to my channel sorry in today's new year
we are doing day four of a week with
SHINee so if you want to see more videos
like this or like makeup tutorials make
sure you give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel so you don't
miss out on any future videos so for
today's video I just want to sit down
and film a Q&amp;amp;A because I haven't done
one of those in so long and my favorite
part about having YouTube channel is
being able to talk to you guys about my
personal life and hearing what you guys
have to say about your life and just all
of that so I just love connecting with
you all so I'm just gonna tell you
everything about my life today
not sir I asked you guys on Twitter to
ask me questions I haven't looked at
them yet but I am gonna go through them
right now and we're gonna we're just
gonna unravel the truth on everything
you know I feel like I look like I have
a pin head right now because this is so
tired that this is so baggy her boobs
are ass speaking of boobs so the first
question is how are your new boobs going
so I just want to give you guys one last
update until I guess like one year or
something because I feel a little things
have changed since my last video so for
you guys that don't know I got a boob
job
how long ago I would say about two and a
half months ago I got these done so the
update on them now is there hardly saw
at all like I feel like they're a part
of my body now I don't feel
uncomfortable I don't feel like they're
too beagle-like not mine I feel like I
was born with them and I feel like their
perfect size for me so when I look down
I'm like oh well like I literally think
they're small now because my body is so
like my shoulders are so broad I look
down and my car just like fits in with
my body like they're not even big like
that's what I think but everyone's like
wow your boobs sorry big and I'm like oh
 I had them done which i think is
amazing and um so for a while there I
had like a I don't know what it was my
friend told me that she had it as well
and she said it was like a damaged nerve
that was healing it so every time I
would like move in a certain position
like it would hurt right here but I
would say probably like a few weeks to a
month ago it finally went so now there's
pretty much no pain in my boobs at all
and I can like move them around now and
they feel a lot more necessary that's
mean they feel a lot more natural and
like I can move like this and it's
they're not
rockhard like the fully bouncing and
stuff like that they're just great and
I'm so happy that I got my boobs done
the way that they look now and the way
that I feel about my boobs now just
makes any other comment about people
saying I shouldn't have got it done or
they like my old boobs better or like
whatever anyone else says about not
liking boob jobs I don't even care like
I'm so happy with what I've done in like
I couldn't be happier sorry
yeah there's no complications at all
that perfect now and I refer checkup in
three months oh Michael this is
literally the cutest question I've ever
got in my life it says how are you
genuinely feeling like that makes me
feel so happy that someone like Loosli
wants to know how I am
you didn't mean like instead of oh hey
how are you it's like how are you like
actually feeling um I am feeling like a
few certain ways I'm really really happy
I just got back from the girl curse with
my family so I feel very like full of
love like from all of my family and
stuff me my sister being getting really
close and I'm just so obsessed with her
like I miss her so much which makes me
so incredibly happy I've drifted apart
from like a bunch of my friends which
obviously sucks off but there's a lot of
other things in my life that I'm really
happy about so right now I'm generally
feeling so incredibly happy I'm so happy
to be filming every day it's put me in
the best mood ever I've been on a bit of
a health kick kind of I've been eating
like a little bit more clean than usual
I mean a lot more cleaning usual because
usually I eat like so yeah I've
been eating really well it makes me feel
amazing I've been having these vitamins
that make me feel really energetic as
well so I'm just I'm really happy and
plus New Year's Eve is coming up so I
mean all my friends are going to party
together which is like one of my
favorite things in the world everyone is
asking about John I will get to that
okay the next thing is what is the best
thing you gave slash received for
Christmas
um I would say the best thing that I
gave was probably to my brother I got
him a Gucci bag because like my whole
that's a materialistic oh my god
my whole family Alisa bug in here my
whole family aren't very well off like
ever since I was little we've never like
had a lot of money and stuff so for me
to be able to get my brother a president
that like isn't a fake like isn't a
ripoff because I know he has a lot of
like a rebel I don't know it just
makes me feel really happy inside like I
know that I can look after my family if
anything ever goes wrong and like get
them presents if they've you know done
something to deserve it so that's what I
did at Christmastime I got everyone
really cool presents I got mom like a
ticket to see it pink and she was so
obsessed with pink so that was really
cool and like super rewarding um in
terms of me getting presents back I
literally like I don't care about
presents at all I would rather give than
take which used to be the complete
opposite to be like oh my god
Christmastime and coming to get presents
oh my god and I'd never get anyone else
like to be presents cuz I didn't really
have a job back then but yeah now all I
think about is just like giving because
seeing someone's reaction to when you
give them something is like the best
thing in the world now I'm just talking
my whole off the next one is do you like
your fans coming up - in public or would
you rather your space I love meeting you
guys I love people coming up to me and
like making conversation with me and all
that it's amazing the only thing that I
like that makes me feel really
uncomfortable is when people just stare
at me and I'm like I don't know if they
hate me I don't know why they're looking
at me like maybe they're not a viewer
maybe they're just like staring at me
but most of the time it is a viewer they
usually come up to me after and they
talk to me but before that I'm like like
why they staring at me like I feel so
uncomfortable like obviously if you went
to the shops and like you had all these
people staring at you and like you had
no idea why you'd feel uncomfortable and
like I get that every single time I go
out so it's like I'm obviously a bit
more used to it than like the average
person but if I'm like by myself or if
I'm feeling a little bit anxious that
day it makes me feel so uncomfortable
but I'm like it's okay just remember
like most people would not like it's
fine
obviously I've had a bad batch of people
that I've met out like it's totally fine
the next thing is are you back with
Jonathan
am i back with Jonathan you guys have
obviously you guys have obviously seen
that Jonathan and I have been hanging
out a lot like all the time and right
now at his current moment Jonathan and I
are not boyfriend and go for
but let's put it this way have you ever
lost someone in your life and you
thought I'm ready to move on with my
life without them I'm ready to open the
next chapter of my life and then when
they've gone you're like what the black
why did I do that
like sometimes you've got to lose
someone to realize how much they mean to
you it's so funny like saying that
because the last video I made was oh my
god I still love him so much but I just
can't see myself with him for the rest
of my life and now I'm just like yeah so
I up I really up but I
will get into that in another video
because there's so much I want to say
about that and obviously I have a lot of
explaining to do because you guys is
probably so confused I know I don't have
to explain myself like I mean but I love
telling you guys like what the fuck's
going on in here what's going on Shani
what is wrong with you the next question
is what is the reason you started
YouTube and honestly I could like I
remember like a year ago I would sit
there and say ah because I was bored I
was just like I didn't have anything
else to do on the weekend so I just made
videos nice I love watching them but now
that I'm older and I like spoken to my
mom and my mom's friends and stuff used
to come every when I'd stop filming and
what they said to me made me think like
I think I started YouTube for a
different reason I started YouTube
because I was so incredibly shy I didn't
really like talking to other people I
didn't like communicating with others so
I thought if I take a camera and put it
in my room I'm not gonna have to do that
I'm just gonna sit there and talk and
I'm gonna be entertained without having
to like literally leave the house like
that's how shy I was I always just
wanted to stay in my comfort zone so
that's why I started YouTube and
obviously doing this has brought me so
many amazing opportunities but still to
this day I'm like sitting in my room
like not having to leave the house so
that's why now I like to push myself and
like go out and do like cool shoots and
like work with really cool companies and
like communicate go to events meet
really cool people
someone said tell me your most
embarrassing /t my story with you and
Michael honestly all of the other things
that me and Michael do are probably best
like off YouTube like anything we ever
talked about anything we ever like ever
like we shouldn't have overpaid like
that's just how it is like people get
offended over everything sir I would
hate to ever repeat anything I mean my
great people but like we just have a
really weird sense of humor and we just
like I don't know what's wrong with us
what are your resolutions or goals for
the new year um for me I think just
earth Queens me I think really focusing
on my health this year and my career
because I like LA what was that I'm not
sure last year well this year I put a
lot of time into all my friends more
partying than my career and my family so
this year I really want to focus on
what's really really important obviously
my friends are so incredibly important
to me but I think my career and my
family need to be number one and that's
what I've realized over the past few
weeks like family's gonna be there until
the day you die you need to put them
first you need to show them that you
love them and you care about them and do
things for them and prove yourself to
them well prove that you love them you
know what I mean and then your career
like that's your whole life like I want
to make something for myself so one day
when I have kids I can look after them
and we can have a great life like right
now I'm already having a great life but
you don't even like I just want to
create this life for myself and focusing
on my career is obviously like the best
thing for that sir yeah I just and
obviously like my fitness as well like I
would love to just like get into fitness
and go to the gym sorry my camera died
anyways um I'd love to be going to gym
like four or so times a week and just
feeling really fit and healthy and I
don't know it just makes such a big
difference because I feel so much
happier when I work out and when I eat
healthy compared to when I'm just
slugging around eating like crap like
honestly I did not realize how much of a
difference it makes when you actually
put time and effort into yourself so
lastly I guess I just wanted to like
have a little overview of the year and I
want to say thank you so much to you
guys for supporting me throughout the
year of 2017 and all the years before
that for you guys that have been in a
way way back when I started this girl
comes to me this follow I come up to me
like a few weeks ago and she's
oh my god I've been following you since
tumbling I'm liking you kidding you've
stuck around like I look type 3 spawns
you stuck around for like 5 years like
how did I not get boring to you like he
must know so much about me because the
man of stuff I've said on my channel
about myself like it's just so crazy
this year has just been such a massive
learning curve I've gone through some
really intense stuff with my friends my
family like so much has going down
and it's really put a lot of strain on
me breaking up with Jonathan that was
literally the hardest thing I've ever
had to do like I've never felt so upset
like I literally remember sitting in my
bed thinking I want to die like
I felt I don't even like to think back
to how I felt like it makes me feel
horrible like I would not want anyone to
have to go through heartbreaking
honestly I never thought it was that bad
like I never in a million years thought
that someone could actually feel that
physical pain in your heart like no I do
not ever want to go through anything
like that again like ever what else has
happened this year I just feel like I've
grown so much as a person like I would
get so anxious doing such little minor
things but recently I've just been
pushing myself even if I am scared even
if I feel like I'm gonna vomit I just
want to push myself to do it and that's
what I've been doing and it just makes
everything so much easier like
everything going forward it just gets
easier and easier and I haven't had
anxiety for like a month
which for me is incredible because a
month prior I had anxiety for like two
weeks straight which is weird to me
because usually I would get it like
every here and there like every few
weeks I'd get like anxiety for a day
like it wasn't too bad but then it got
to this point where I have it nearly
every single day and had be in this
weird mindset and I'm like I don't feel
like myself like I felt so weird but
then I don't know if things just started
looking out for me and I went to go see
someone about my health because I'm like
I just feel really tired and like
something's like a little bit off with
my body and my health and like it's
making my mind feel a little funny and
like not motivated like I need help with
like pretty much like my body and I've
got all these different vitamins and
like now I have energy
like I had all of these different things
like the minerals and everything that
would just like really low in my body
and I was lacking so many different
things so now I'm taking like a little
capsules a day of like all these
different supplements and I feel so much
better like so you've really just got to
focus from the inside out you've really
got to focus on your health because
that's one thing that I just blew my
mind this year like at the end of the
year I'm like wow this is important so
make sure you guys really take care of
yourself and I hope you have an amazing
amazing new year I oh my god I can't
believe how fast this year is gone like
I remember just last new year I mean no
I don't feel so drunk okay yeah I really
hurt you guys have an amazing day I will

more video to go of a week with Chinese
