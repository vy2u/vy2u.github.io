I'm doing a ariana grande inspired hair
tutorial she's been wearing a hair like
this for so long so I thought I'd go
ahead and recreate it I'm also doing a
review on the new me Titan 3 curling
wand which is the one that I'm using in
this tutorial so let's get started so
I'm starting out by parting my damp hair
roughly one inch above my ears and then
clipping it up so for the hairdryer I'm
using the nume signature tourmaline
which by the way is so so good and I'm
going to be adding the John Frieda root
booster blow-dry lotion and this will
just add a lot of volume to my hair as
ariana has extremely volumize hair lucky
her so basically all I'm doing is going
ahead and spraying it in the roots of my
hair and then just blow drying it until
it's completely dry
I'm just continuing this process until
the bottom half of my hair is super
volumize then I'm going ahead and
popping about four or five extension
weft in the bottom half of my hair as my
hair is super thin so I guess this
tutorial is solely based around this
thickness of your hair it'll make the
biggest difference if you're going for
that ariana grande inspired look and now
time for the bangs I'm just going to
part my fringe quite deeply to the right
I'm just combing a neat section and
securing it in place with a bobby pin
just so it doesn't get in the way now
it's time to part my hair so I'm going
to be parting it so it's roughly in line
with the top of both ears and I'm going
to begin by brushing that hair back in a
ponytail and then securing it in place
with a hair tie so I'm making sure that
there's no lumps or bumps in my hair and
then just pulling it back super tight
and moving on I'm clipping the medium
size barrel to the head of the curling
one and then I'm going to go ahead and
part my hair in 1-inch pieces at a time
and then wrap the hair around the barrel
and I'll start by curling my hair in the
middle of the head downwards I won't
really need to worry about the roots of
my hair and make sure that you curl away
from your face oh and also don't forget
to wear them a little gloves that it
comes with because honestly when you
burn your hand you will know about it so
make sure you pop them on and it'll save
you a few fingers this process is pretty
basic I'm just simply wrapping the hair
around the barrel until all of my hair
is curled including the ponytail now I'm
just going to give you a few little
thoughts about the titan-3 set so the
main reason as to why I enjoy it is
because the ones are titanium and make
your hair look super shiny and healthy
and also another cool thing is when you
sleep on the curls they look amazing in
the next day which is pretty cool
because I am kind of lazy when it comes
to hair and I was lucky enough to get
you guys some coupon codes so the first
one is watermelon you can get the titan
3 and a free argan oil for $99 with the
$15 shipping to Australia the second one
is ice cream you can get 50% off and $15
shipping to Australia so moving on I'm
using the John Frieda
whoa wait a mo to brush my little baby
hairs into place because mine are quite
noticeable and this product honestly is
like magic the last thing I did is went
ahead and scrunch my hair up so it was
nice and volume oast so basically this
curling set comes with three different
size barrels you have the bigger one for
bigger loose beachy waves and then the
medium size which is what I use today
and lastly the smaller one for tight
ringlet curls and then the head of
course so make sure you check the
description box for all of the coupon
details and I'll speak to you very soon
bye guys I just don't I don't know do
you guys like them I don't know how I
feel so the mix of three things are from
choice calm I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
