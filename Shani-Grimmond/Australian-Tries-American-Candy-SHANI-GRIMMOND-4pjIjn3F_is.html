my channel so in today's video I'm
filming an Australian tries American
candy video wow I have so much stuff
here and I'm honestly so excited because
I'm really hungry and I love lollies I
love chocolate and it's my first triumph
for the first time trying everything in
here and I also got drinks I also made
sure to get a bottle of water
an Australian one just to wash down any
gross flavors we may experience in this
video so let's go ahead and get started
so excited
Oh first thing that we have here is
Hershey's chocolate Twizzlers so I'm
guessing this is kind of like licorice
but chocolate flavor and it says at the
top it is low-fat I mean if I'm gonna
eat something that is a treat I don't
want it to be like that I just wanted to
be delicious and filled with sugar and
fat there's like rubber and the
consistency is like robot
um plastic melted with a bit of cocoa
powder oh my god I don't like it I mean
if I wanted to eat plastic I 500 sort of
all plastic see you next thing we have
here is the Baby Ruth use your chakra it
says bursting with peanuts are rich with
caramel and chewy non-gaap well I love
peanuts and I love caramel so I'm
probably gonna love these oh my god
oh wow just say exact say what Snickers
mmm Wow I know what well the next thing
that we have is a red hot cinnamon
flavored candy hopefully it tastes like
donuts I really don't like hot stuff but
I just thought I would get anything from
the American section so I tried all OH
oh look at that it's just like little
jelly beans that are red it smells like
poo I'm honestly not looking forward to
this oh wow they're really hard that
crunchy
I'll go a Chewie they're so gross oh
this is open Oh what thought so right
when they said they're hot they're
actually really spicy no I don't need
this whole box is someone paid me and
there's a lot in here next we have
jalapeno Pringles um I don't even know
what help heroes are I know that in
Australia but I've never tried one so
this is going to be interesting I
actually don't even like Pringles to
begin with Oh actually sounds really
good
oh my god
YUM there's like pizza I never thought I
like Pringles but sometimes for the good
this is what I'm most excited about
marshmallow fluff when I saw this I was
like watch god it's literally less not
hmm
oh this actually is really yummy it just
tastes like melted sugar that's all
I love it it says on the back of it that
you put it on sandwiches this on
sandwiches I mean it tastes okay but the
flavors kind of dull like it's not like
bursting with flavor like delicious yum
I'm gonna do the whole table which is
kind of like oh yeah that's okay but I'm
gonna put it down now next we have some
Duff energy drink on susan's it's isn't
it like Duff Beer when Homer goes and
drinks his beer at the bar I also let me
be a bit know let's crack her open my
brother said that this is absolutely
disgusting but I have high hopes because
her mom loved his stuff oh my god not
bad so it tastes like orange Fanta
tastes like pan uh-huh every time I
swallow it I feel like I need to burp it
has like so much gas in it and usually I
don't burp that much so oh actually
pretty good but nothing special I mean
I've
tasted something like this before she
knows I've tried the normal Cheers
before but I literally can't even read
what they taste like but these ones are
the flaming hot cheetos my god what the
fuck they're red this does not look
appetizing at all I've never seen a red
chip do you mean Cheetos makeup tutorial
today I'm using this cheeto to put on my
mascara
they smell like noodles they have the
same consistency as twisties and now
they're starting to burn up my mouth
mmm oh my god it's so good looking at
them makes me feel bit off cuz the red
what what I'm saying to sweat and my
throat is burning and I probably not
start dripping snot out of my nose in a
second so next one it is ah I have a
little story about these ones these are
the sour skittles right and we used to
have sour skittles that look the exact
same
so I opened it and I had some because I
was like I already tried these so it
doesn't really matter like my first
reaction you know sir I ate the whole
packet and left one because though it's
that freaking good or what has happened
looks like a penis hmm anyway oh hang on
we used to have these skittles in
Australia you know just like a normal
schedule with the sugary sour stuff on
the outside but all of a sudden they
change to lack sorry stuff on the inside
the so there's no like sugar I'm really
mad about that but um turns out the old
Australian ones and these ones aren't
the exact same these ones taste 100
times better I don't know what it is but
these ones are just like my life sorry
if you guys live in America and you have
those south skittles I'm so freakin
Jules I'm going back to the shop and
buying 50 boxes of those and I'm not
going to have the original Australian
skills anymore oh I have a feeling I'm
going to love this
so incredibly much I've tried normal
Reese's cupcakes and boy if you like
Nutella no sorry if you like peanut
butter and chocolate you will love
Reese's
honestly tastes amazing so these are the
Reese's crispy crunchy 260 calories holy
fire yellow so it pretty much just looks
like a log of turd with little nut
things in it Oh hmm I think this is off
stale ah it's off on our best before the
fourth month of 2016
oh fuck that was last month I feel like
if this was fresh out of the factory I
would love this so much you can
definitely still taste all the peanut
butter and the Chocolate it's real
therefore might have alibi I swear to
God when I finish this video I'm just
taking all this stuff chucking it in the
lounge room I'm going to pig out and
watch netflix next one
this is the so dot what you can't see
the two letters under this guy's chin so
it's a soda and it is strawberry cream
soda or maybe it's like the creamy side
that we have here first of all who the
fuck who's gonna drink a can bigger than
my head not me Oh
got him
holy shit that actually tastes like
medicine my mom used to give me one I
used to have a cough awesome so it's not
very busy and I really love fizzy drinks
so that's probably where it first goes
downhill medicine it doesn't taste that
sugary and I love sugar I know it says
all-natural at the top maybe that's what
it is it's just a bit you know just not
sure enough for me next we have a Three
Musketeers
it smells like dark chocolate I don't
lack that chocolate oh it's like a milky
way it has a fluffy truffle on the
inside you're really soft you bite into
it it feels like a pillow those like I'm
fighting two clouds next thing we have
is sweet and sour skittles oh they smell
really good okay so I'm gonna have pink
one first which is sweet strawberry
these are good I think I have like a
serious obsession with skittles blue one
I'll see bit sour mmm that's how I not
overly but it's good it's bearable next
we have an almond joy so this says milk
chocolate coconut and almond that sounds
really good it sounds like it would be
similar to a forever brochure here in
Australia and oh I get a box of those
for Christmas and they go on a day oh
it's like little logs hello mummy all
that coconut that coconut is so good so
the nut tastes like it's been there for
about a year
not a very fresh night but the chocolate
and a coconut part is good really good
last but not least we have pop-tarts the
hot Sunday fudge so I believe you have
to put these in the toaster mum is back
with her toasted what's a cool pop-tart
smells like a cupcake all right let's do
this you what isn't a toaster that's a
way to say I'm over home I know the
cookie on it is really mushy so it's
really moist and then the frosting stuff
on top is really good
it just has like normal I think but
together it tastes like a cake well
there we go with the video I know there
are so many other
American candies at a much more popular
and stuff but this is pretty much all I
could get my hands on for now I would be
happy to do another video with like more
popular things and stuff because I'm not
bashing American candy or anything there
is a lot of gross Australian candy as
well a lot of really good stuff oh yeah
I just thought I would share my opinion
I am so picky when it comes to food
that's probably why I was like this
girl's at this girl's but there was a
lot good things but yeah that is pretty
much all I have save this video I really
hope you guys liked it some of you
people in America are bloody lucky to
have those skittles that's all I can say
I'm sorry I keep talking about them I'm
gonna go now I hope you guys have an
amazing day and I'll see you very soon
