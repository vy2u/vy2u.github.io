my channel so in today's video I'm
trying American candy so I've done it
once before and he honest I didn't
really like it so I thought I'd give it
another try
I have heaps of stuff right here so it
should dig on into it because I'm really
hungry not going to lie the first thing
that I have are these warheads we can
warhead tier but they come in different
packaging and it was in the US section
so maybe they taste different it was
like a little jelly bean so if you are
from Australia you would know that ours
come in like individual packets and they
like really big and round and the yellow
ones are supposed to be in the most sour
so let's try this one first oh crap the
heck is not even what the hell is
squishy it's like a chewy and it's not
even that sour oh my god the pink one
tastes like dishwashing detergent and it
is a bit more sour blue
this is so wicked oh my god oh that was
how the green one is so sad off it takes
a little but not as good as one in
Australia sorry things are going to be
so gross
sour cream dill pickle Pringles yuck
let's give this a shot
shall we oh it's all right you know I do
it oh my god that is literally for your
stuff I need something to wash that down
like ASAP this is the mountain Jew
whiteout smooth citrus we have Mountain
jury here but it's like a lemon I think
I don't know about it tastes really good
so let's do this or thirds like well got
him mo I still have pickles in my mouth
what the hell
it says 170 calories per can why do I
have calories all over everything
don't really care sorry mastitis it has
flat one second of all it takes for your
exact same except has a little bit of a
different aftertaste not bad though not
bad oh I have a Twinkie I'm so excited
to try this Winky what are you gonna
kiss it just like a little piece of cake
with cream I think mom said she hates
them which is saying something cause she
pretty much anything hmm
that smells good
the cream right here is really yummy but
the bread is like hard I was like it's
been sitting there for like two months
all right what are we happier it says
combos baked snacks with real cheese or
what it's all pulling it out what is
that let's give it a little but I can't
decide if I like overall so the outside
is like a Jets just like a biscuit and
it's got filling up cheese in the middle
but I don't think I'd get the change
before so let me do that oh I like it
mmm oh my god I've been dragging this
member in my whole entire life
the jump top pepper dark chocolate Omega
Laird and I hate dark chocolate so much
air so it looks like this there is like
busy stuff coming out of the middle I
have tried dr. pepper like normal drink
before it was revolting I hated it so
much ah oh my gosh No Oh bindi
I won't even eat this if someone paid me
yeah I've got to wash them out there
next thing I have is the hubba bubba
outrageous original I've never seen this
before
I don't really know how to feel it
tastes like
I'm eating Tula cleaner or something yes
we have a great pub a bubble I don't
know if this is going to taste the same
as the great that we have but I'm hoping
it does because I love it rip on into
that honey oh my god it smells so good
it smells a lot stronger than ours and I
swear these pieces of bigger than ours
as well my mother like watering really
bad right now but it has a different
consistency I kind of like this one
better
oh my god the next thing we have here is
the bits of honey again it says how many
calories 190 calories hey you open it it
comes in like little individual
rectangles blood Oh think that's coffee
it smells like a toffee cake very chewy
oh my god it's actually good actually no
it's not
it tastes like one of those really cheap
cheap chocolates that doctors give you
after you get a needle or something
congratulations you didn't faint not
actually burning that again
hey I'm saving the grossest thing to
last because I actually think I'll feel
sick after I eat it so go for the good
stuff first study juicy fruits Starbucks
sugar free oh come on this is a gun and
it really caught my eyeball because I
loved you super and I freaking miss of
Starbucks wait does a Starbucks and it
does I stabbed it this is so American so
you know those little starburst squares
again it takes exactly like that except
this is like a chewy version next thing
I have is the bubble tape sour blue
raspberry sorry that I got so much gum
and it's really like gum Oh sour really
sour
oh sorry last but not least we have
a chili licks sucker in the shape of a
chili can't taste anything it tastes
like a candy cane oh my god my mouth is
so you get hot I'm concerned I feel like
spicy food it's supposed to go on like
dinner or like lunch or something like
put some chili sauce on your food but
you know lolli
are you kidding where I feel like
lawyers are just supposed to be like
sweet and yummy but each to their own
you actually this pika
cuz I don't want it so that we have been
trying American candy once again and I
don't like it or once again thanks
America I'm totally kidding I'm sure
there's really really yummy things over
there I will be going to America one day
I promise you guys that's like the main
place that I want to do it but anyways
um I think over second meeting -
Australian candy like the taste feels
very heavy but this didn't make me very
happy at all
but anyways if you liked this video
