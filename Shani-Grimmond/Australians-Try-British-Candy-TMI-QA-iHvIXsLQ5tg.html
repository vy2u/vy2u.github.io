know more than anyone yeah you know
everything from me like how do you
single could actually be offended if you
didn't tell me a secret yes are you how
do we become friends I feel like we're
told that in your video but I'm pretty
sure we like just knew each other for
mutual friends
and I spend a is bibo days everyone just
got into each other now area and then we
just went to like a disco with policy
you get low when the whistle blows baby
baby baby what oh my god that's we only
like single he cares and they're like
jumping together like that's how I
became friends and then we just hung out
and oh my brother dated first sister my
sister lost her virginity no brother
there's a oh my god this is so funny
have you ever like the same guy ah yes
hey I was evil I was new thinking about
girls who India
yeah I guess I can
have had like a little crush on like two
different guys do you think we kind of
got competitive I would say maybe a
little bit we get all like wait I really
like the same kind of people because we
have like different tastes she goes for
like the really big guys and I go for
like the pretty boys he'd say that right
I are for like big boat footy player
like rough boys and she goes for the
little little sorry they want that go
shopping clean camera mega channel
that's not a way to describe it but I
decided funny um yeah we have here a
heist basically but we have like two you
guys to sin not like just like a little
crush mm-my like even what is something
that annoys you about the other person
mine has to be one cheeks my mouth
opened by the same time of racial
idealism of swimming a very the day
other day the other day I was filming a
video the other day and when I was
editing I was like oh my god I'm eating
with my mouth open the whole time wait
that was the same as me and then tumblr

a snapchat well sorry about your
400 second it's story okay the next
question is how do we deal with social
media hey I just had a lull about this
one but we usually we just like screens
it to each other if it's funny and then
we just have a laugh or if I like

sometimes you might get
emotional and one of us just like it's

fake I don't mate didn't it yeah it's
