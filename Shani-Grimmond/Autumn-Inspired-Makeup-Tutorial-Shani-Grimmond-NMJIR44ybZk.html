how to get this autumn look so when I
think of autumn I just think of the
leaves and the purples and the oranges
and this is what I came up with I hope
you guys love it as much as I do and
let's go ahead and get started
starting with my brows I'm taking my
essence eyebrow at stylus set so I'm
using a darker shade and just starting
from the tail and working my way all the
way to the front of my brow so just
making them really quite dark because
this is a dramatic eye look now going in
with my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as per
usual I'm just popping this all of my
wigs to prime and to cancel out the
discoloration and after I Pat this on I
always go ahead and set it with some
powder moving on to eye shadow I'm
taking my makeup geek eyeshadow in the
shade Peach Smoothie I'm using this as a
transition shade so I'm just taking a
massive blending brush and then just
popping this in my crease and also
blowing it out as well so just making
sure to go back and blend and blend and
blend until there's no harsh lines at
all and then taking my TG bronzes
palette I'm taking a bronzy orange color
on a smaller blending brush and just
popping this in my crease I just started
with a really small amount and then I
just kept building it up until it was
the color that I wanted so because my
eye shape is really flat in I do have
small eyes I like to bring the eyeshadow
out color to the edge of my eyebrow to
make them look a bit more bigger and
elongated that's my number one tip for
you small girls eye girls a girls smoker
eye
and then of course flowing back in with
my makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow
to make sure there's no harsh lines so
just taking that flam blending brush and
putting that right above with that last
color and now taking the star of the
show the makeup geek Vegas lacks pigment
it is a beautiful bronze color I think
it's perfect for autumn so what I do is
I sprayed a bit of Smashbox photo finish
primer water to make sure the pigment is
extremely pigmented and I just part of
that all over my lid and then taking my
chichi bronzer palette again I'm picking
up a kind of rich cranberry purple shade
and I'm using this to really define my
eyes for just popping this on the outer
crease of my eye we pay at large pencil
brush and then we're going ahead and
cleaning up all of that flat as you can
see there was a lot so now moving on to
the face I'm taking my Smashbox photo
finish primer water this makes my face
feel absolutely amazing now taking my
derived cosmetics BB illumination that
plus a facial cream I'm just popping
this all over my face because as we know
in autumn sometimes our skin starts to
get really dry like mine does so I'm
adding this to make my skin look really
jewy it smells so bad and then taking at
my bourgeois happy light foundation this
is in the second dark shade it is such a
beautiful color match to my big tent
neck I'm just applying this with a damp
Beauty Blender it has a beautiful cover
over blue pad me it was a beautiful
coverage and I've been completely
obsessed with it lately
now taking my mac prolongwear concealer
in the shade NC 20 I'm also applying
this with my damp you bundle so this is
just to highlight under my eyes quite a
bit and also to cancel out this
coloration a Beauty Blender is
personally at my favorite way to apply
concealer it just does such an amazing
job and then taking my Mac program in
the shade light boost I'm just putting
this on the highest point to my face to
highlight even more
I'm not taking my Australis AC on to our
contouring and highlighting palette I'm
just picking up the ladders banana shade
and just popping this under my eyes and
everywhere else we just highlighted just
make sure it does a crease throughout
the day and then just set everything
else I'm taking my nas powder in the
shade peach and then just lightly
putting this down everywhere now time to
finish the eyes so I'm starting with the
orange that we put in the crease and
just putting that from outer corner to
inner corner and then taking that deep
purple that was in the outer V I'm just
popping that really close to my lashline
and then of course blending it all
together so it looks really smoky for
mascara I'm taking my benefit fairyland
my Urban Decay perversion mascara
they're my two favorites I love how they
make my eyelashes look so just put in
heaps and heaps on my top and bottom
lashes and then of course going in with
summer falsies because I feel like no
makeup look is complete without some
humongous lashes
now taking my NYX retractable liner in
this shade white blank I'm just putting
this in my waterline to really open up
my eyes since the rest of the look is
quite dark and then going in with this
shimmery white champagne color I'm just
popping this right under my eyebrows for
a really nice highlight and I was
sticking with this shimmery look because
I never do shimmery and I think it looks
really pretty and of course time to
Brunn's the face so I'm taking my Rimmel
and natural bronzer and I'm using this
under my cheekbones so really chisel
them out and to make them look a bit
more defined and then also taking around
the sides of my forehead to make it
appear a bit smaller and also to add
some color and they're not forgetting my
jawline as well and then putting it on
the side of my nose to make it appear a
lot smaller I know it seems like a lot
of bronzing and that's probably because
it is now taking a makeup heat blush
this is a beautiful purple shade I'm
just popping this on the apples of my
cheek and then blending it back it is a
lot more purple in person it just was
washed out from the lights so time for
highlighter I'm taking my nails in the
shade albatross it has a gorgeous golden
yellow kind of finish to it so I'm just
popping this right above my cheekbones
and then also on my nose and my Cupid's
bow so join my lips was a bit of a
process so I started out with you mixing
that pencil in the shade hot red and I
just outlined my lips with this and then
I figured that this isn't really autumn
appropriate so I went ahead and just
fill my lips in with the NYX lipstick in
the shade licorice and then of course to
get rid of the red lip liner I took my
Mac lip pencil
in the shade at night moth
and the finishing touch is taking my red
carpet red lipstick by - Tod bar I'm
just popping this right in the center of
my lips to give the illusion of bigger
partier lips and then we are done guys I
hope you guys liked this video as much
as I do I'm obsessed with a makeup look
and I will definitely be wearing in the
autumn time so don't forget to like this
video and I'll see you very very soon
bye it is just a warm like rose kind of
pink color it's just so beautiful and
easy to wear it's really pigmented</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
