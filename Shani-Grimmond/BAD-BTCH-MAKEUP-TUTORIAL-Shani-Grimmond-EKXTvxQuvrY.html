channel sorry in today's video I really
want to do like a nice dramatic doc
cranberry look both on the eyes and on
the lips so I'm really excited right now
because I literally haven't done a
dramatic look in so long with dark
colors so I really hope you guys liked
this video and let's go ahead and jump
right in it looks like someone's just
like sap right here and just squish my
button keep on the first thing that I'm
going to do is why my eyelids my
eyebrows is still healing so if you're
wondering why I'm being so careful
around my brows that's why in my browser
honestly so it she like I want nothing
more than to just itch the actual
out of them right now and then I'm just
gonna set that concealer down with my
Rimmel stay matte powder I'm just gonna
dust that over oh my goodness I'm so
excited for this so I'm gonna go in with
the morphe 35 that be palette and I'm
going to take this beautiful purpley
cranberry shade right here
it's very purple so that's gonna be the
cut away okay so I went to the right one
this one down here yeah so I'm just
going to put this in my crease and then
I might have to use a brown to blend out
the edges of this one after finding the
mirror I'm just gonna look down and pop
this right in the natural socket of my
crease oh it's very pink like what I
like
it's gonna look a little bit crazy at
the start but trust me it'll come to ya
there okay so next I'm gonna go into the
shade are you kidding me this is a brown
and I'm just going to blend out the
edges of that purple and kind of diffuse
it and blend it up a little bit higher
the brush and I'm using for this one is
the morphe m51
it's very good I'd like to start
blending from the middle of the
eyeshadow so it's not too harsh on the
outer corner or the inner corner like
where I initially put the color down
kind of like blue ends evenly Oh
the next color that I'm taking is a wine
and dine this burgundy color right here
and I'm pretty much just gonna put this
right over that last purple color
because I want to make it like more of a
berry turn I just wanted that pebble
color to peek through about this just
ever so slightly oh my gosh this is so
pigmented morphe and violet Voss palette
are incredible by the way if you guys
are wondering every time I sit there and
blend my eyeshadow which we just jam out
to music and then on my lid I'm gonna go
in where that the shade teddybear this
one's a chocolate brown and I'm gonna
hmmm yeah I'm gonna put that all over my
lid wants to be nice and dark then I can
blend it up into my crease after Wow
that's amazing
so instead of swiping I'm just putting
this on then going back in with the
shade wine and dine I'm gonna bill lend
out the edges of that color blending so
nicely the next step is to clean up all
of that fallout underneath my eyes
because the last card that you want
under there is purple tones literally I
always take the corner of my makeup wipe
so it's like perfectly straight and I
just like run it yeah let's protect this
face so I'm gonna go in with the Abeka
velvet blurring primer perfecting base
this is my first time using I'm so
excited to see how it goes I have a
little bit of glitter my fingers from
all the I shudder but Miller oh it's
very liquidy
interesting oh it feels super lat
it's blending in
it literally dries instantly on my skin
as well full foundation today I'm gonna
go in with the dual air flash foundation
in the shade will show you in 300 this
is a really good foundation it's really
weird how you put a spray onto the brush
so it's kind of nice because it does go
everywhere so I'm just gonna do it over
here
it looks very beautiful on the skin
there it's blended I always like to go I
ruin my lids just so when I put the
lipstick on it's more of like a blank
canvas oh it's it this is like a medium
coverage it doesn't feel heavy on the
skin at all you know which I love
now for the concealer I'm gonna go in
with the Becca aqua luminous perfecting
concealer and I have the shade fair so
I'm just gonna pop this underneath my
eyes it has a really nice applicator
it's so much on love turns under here
you know what to do don't just taking my
Beauty Blender and I'm gonna blend this
out this literally makes under the eyes
look so good I'm going to fake
underneath my eyes with the makeup
studio translucent powder in one I'm
just gonna put a little bit on the back
of the lid and going in I always get
like so relaxed just sitting here
playing around with makeup is so much
and then just say oh my god I just
tickle my fur and I was about to like
okay I'm gonna take the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless powder in the
shade at true 2-0 and I'm just gonna
take like a buffer brush and I'm just
gonna on this Li okay so my power
board was just making the weirdest
noises and I only changed it today so
that's the only thing that it could be
making that noise so I just change the
oil because I wanna say I feel like it's
gonna blow up
where's my paddle I'm stressed anyways
as I was saying I'm just gonna pack this
all over my
face and our foundation does not move
even I'm probably just gonna wash this
off straight after because I hate
wearing this much makeup in public I
feel like a leader I mean I would for
sure but like I feel like it's more
comfortable to just mind our makeup
anyway so whatever then for my lower
lashline I'm gonna go in with wine and
dine again and I'm just gonna take this
from out of cornets unicorn on my lower
lashline and I'm really gonna smoke it
out because it needs to be in proportion
with how dramatic all the eye shadow is
above this with a small pencil brush I'm
just gonna take that dark brown and put
that on the outer corner I'm just taking
a little bit of mac fix+
and I'm gonna pick up the shade toffee
which is this beautiful gold right here
and I'm gonna pop this on my inner
corners for a little pop of glitter and
then for eyeliner I'm gonna take this
black one from Marc Jacobs
oh yeah it's a windy one and I'm just
gonna pop this in my waterline to really
make it little extra dark up all my way
I just perks so hard on my eyeball my
gosh that is a very pigmented there for
the mascara I'm gonna take this one from
Marc Jacobs it is called the major
Volume Mascara I love the packaging so
much and the one looks really good as
well so let's see how this goes oh wow
oh my gosh that is so good so much
product in my lashes even though I'm
putting some really big pulses on anyway
for my lashes today I'm gonna go in with
the holy grail lashes in the style of
princess I use this in a makeup tutorial
not truth far back and they are so
beautiful so I'm just gonna pop these
little bad boys on I just like to look
down and put it as close as I can to my
lash line
now the hard part is done we can move on
to the face and make the face kind of
you know blend in a little bit more with
the eyes so I'm gonna take this bronzing
powder by I'll be brown and this one's
in the shade golden light one so I'm
just gonna take my little Revlon brush
oh well that's actually really light
isn't it let's see it looks like I'm
just gonna pop this on my cheekbones oh
that's really pretty
this is really nice like a natural wash
of color to the face I'm also gonna put
this down my neck as well now for the
blush I'm gonna go in with this one from
a wet and wild in a shade of apricot in
the middle this one's like an orangey
shimmery shade very pin
Oh imagine using that as a blush brush
okay I'm just gonna take my bronzer
brush and put a little bit of this on my
cheeks I don't want anything can't just
because we already have so much purple
going on on the eyes this is perfect
look and then I'm gonna take my Rimmel
stay matte powder and I'm just going to
clean up this line right here ever so
slightly I don't but I just want to be
clean oh my god I shaved like we're not
shaved I got like a razor thing guess
that's shaming I'll show you this thing
it's first to get rid of peach fuzz on
your face and I did it like right here
and right here you can see right there
the foundation like isn't sticking it's
really patchy but like whatever Justin
or if you do that foundation doesn't
stick and I'm concerned mexic splush you
know what it is okay I haven't used this
highlighter in the longest time it's the
Becca highlight in the shade this
up preset for the Prosecco Pope
Michael's gonna drill me for saying that
wrong Prosecco a pop okay I think I have
at that time this sounds like a
beautiful gold color I just didn't want
to do anything true like because
everything is just looking really like
ashy on me lately so I'm just gonna put
that right here oh my gosh look how
beautiful that is
woah the brush I'm using is a zoeva 1/3
full it's really good pilot
I really like how the beca highlights
aren't like junky that is really fine
but you can still make them really
dramatic now time for the lips I'm going
to take this ammo fee a lip liner in the
shade why do I always have wait
names I can never say anything I'm just
gonna leave it down below but it's a
really nice maroon color I really want
to do like Doc lips it's gonna look
really crazy but okay Wow the formula of
that was amazing oh my god I thought it
was an eye liner as well I was like no
okay so for the lipstick I'm gonna take
the Marc Jacobs
Lamacq lip cream in the shade 290 this
one's a beautiful dark purple she's
gonna make a baby wow wow this is like
nearly black but this is seriously like
such a good formula I'm just really
skinny to get a white teeth and then
lastly oh my god ahaha this is so great
to look at myself with like this okay so
I'm gonna take the glam glow glow set up
I need to cover my eyebrow tell you
don't as I said I feel like I need some
sort of like jewelry this is like mum
earrings and so cute my foots like
themself because I've been wearing them
every single day for like two months
they're like three dollars but they are
not gold anymore they went yellow and
okay I need to fix my hair he needs to
her like that he may have stuff my hair

felt like being a really dramatic I put
in some green eye contacts and a
bandanna sir I really hope you guys
liked this makeup I'm actually obsessed
with how it turned out every time I talk
