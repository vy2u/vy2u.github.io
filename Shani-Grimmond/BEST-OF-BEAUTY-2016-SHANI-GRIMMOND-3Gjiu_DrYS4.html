in today's video i'm going to be sharing
with you my all-time favorite products
everything that I was literally obsessed
with in 2016 and still to this day so
just my favorites things that I'm
obsessed with things that I will
definitely recommend to you guys and
thinks I just couldn't live without will
certainly make up but I just went
through my cupboard and I was just like
yeah yeah yeah that's gonna be and
that's going to be in like everything in
here is just like a ten out of ten okay
so let's go ahead and jump straight into
this video out of my way so let's go
ahead and start with primer this is the
Too Faced hangover primer I love this
because I have really dry skin and to me
it just feels like a moisturizer so it
really hydrates my face before I put on
foundation and stuff and I feel like um
like foundation goes on a lot smoother
when you have a really nice and
moisturizer face so I love this stuff I
think it's perfect cube packaging as
well my next favorite is actually a
really new discovery and this is the
tada rainforest of the sea water
foundation I have a shade medium tan
sand and it matches perfectly to my fake
tan this is the foundation that I'm
wearing right now it is like a medium to
full coverage you can definitely build
it up but it just feels so lightweight
on the skin and just makes the skin look
so healthy and airbrushed it actually is
like a little dropper so as you can see
it definitely is like a really thin it's
like water and I would definitely
recommend blending this in with a really
big kabuki brush because when I did use
a Beauty Blender it was super patchy and
I hated it but when I use his brush I
was like yes yes honey well now if we
conceal art this one is a Smashbox
Studios skin 24-hour concealer I have
the shade at light/medium and I've just
been leaning towards this out of every
other concealer that I have in my
collection and trust me I have literally
every other concealer you can probably
think of it's just been a blessing in my
life honestly I think I'm really out
because I've use it that many times but
um it just blends out really easy with a
Beauty Blender because it's not thick at
all it has a really nice coverage and
the color of this concealer is stunning
it's really like one shade lighter than
my skin tone so it doesn't add that
really stark
like look under the eyes and it really
fan of that any more this just like
literally comes out all of this data
left in here all of this all of the
discoloration under my eyes and it just
does an incredible job like Sarah
playing
thank you god bless your soul next we
have the benefit speed rail I've been
using this every single time
I do my eyebrows it makes them look
absolutely amazing so what it is is like
a little spoolie with a dark brown gel
in it so I just run this in my brows at
the front my brows I push up sorry I've
washed my brows up sorry all of the
hairs look really full and then with the
ends of my brows I just push them down
so they stay in place but this is
honestly like a must in my makeup kit it
just went everywhere all right let's
move on to the fun part a little bit of
eyeshadow and glitter and all of that
good stuff so I'm sure you guys have
heard people talk about this product a
million times in 2016 because it just
like blew up it is the Urban Decay heavy
metal glitter glue hanging glitter liner
in the shade of Midnight Cowboy so this
is just a liner that has a tiny little
tip on the end and it is perfect for
making a cut creases it's just gold
glitter it looks a little bit silver it
just like works with every single look
honestly it's so easy to apply it dries
really quickly and the glitter is so
incredibly opaque and another thing that
you can use this for instead of just
like a glitter liner as a cut crease or
even just like a winged liner you can
use this on the inner corners to add a
bit of glitter sparkle in there and it
just pot looks absolutely stunning and
it lasts a really long time as well
something that is very similar to this
but I use it for like different reasons
it is the a Mac gold glitter I love this
so much my friend actually um left the
lid undone and my dogs ate it and their
 was glittery so she bought me a new
one which I'm really happy about because
I was dying dad honestly this is
incredible so this is just a pure of
gold glitter I just use a glitter glue
underneath it put it all over my lid it
just looks stunning it's so sparkly and
the color is just like beautiful I also
like to use this on my inner corners as
well now let's move on to my favorite
eyeshadow palettes this eyeshadow color
just tops every single one I've ever
used it is the modern renaissance
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills
I've never used a shadows as good as a
Nastasia the formula is just so buttery
and it just blends so seamlessly on the
eyes it never is patchy there's just not
one thing that I'm
upset about with this pellet like
everything is amazing the shimmery shows
in here are really nice and like foiled
looking they're not just like a little
bit of shimmer like kylie jenner's
pellets sorry the gold color and Kylie's
palette was nice but the other two just
like the shimmers weren't like as
intense as what I'd hoped like this as
you can see I just literally swatch it
once and it's just insane another thing
that I love about this palette is it
literally has everything you need so it
has transition shades and has shimmery
mattes it has like dark light you know
any mean like it has every single thing
you need and all the curls in here I
would use so it's not that often you
come across the PAL and you're like oh
geez every single shade in here but
pretty much everything in here is
amazing and to top it off the packaging
is like so soft sorry yeah next we have
the chichi spices eye shadow palette I
never thought I would actually put a
eyes shadow palette in my favorites
video from the drugstore as bad as that
sounds I honestly find it so hard for
drugstore eyeshadows to be as good as
like ones like this but this one is very
very good especially for the price and
to top it off it has really nice warm
shades in here as well
the colors were not really nicely
they're super pigmented they're
obviously not as pigmented as Anastasio
like makeup geek or something they're
both incredible but it is really really
good quality still and I'm very
impressed with this let's move on to the
last eyeshadow palette that I was
literally using so much this year well
last year my bed this is the morphe 3 5
0 palette I'm sure you guys have heard
people talk about this a million times
before and it's kind of died off a
little bit but I will always love this
palette as you can see I have a really
weird obsession with the warm tones the
last two palettes I shared with you
pretty much look the same as this but I
just use this so many times I love all
of the orange shades and I also love
that there is nice bronzy shades as well
so you can make a lot of different looks
with this eyeshadow palette and I
couldn't not add this paladin because
the amount of times I used this palette
on an off-camera was kind of ridiculous
shut up
my neighbors things so loud and it's so
rude oh my god they're just sort of
being louder I hate living near
people I hate people except you guys
alright now let's move on to my favorite
face powders so the first one I'm pretty
sure you guys seen this coming this is a
Laura Mercier translucent powder I've
been through two of these and this one's
nearly empty so I'm really sad because
it is super expensive but as I used it
more I just started using less because I
realized how quickly it did go but this
is amazing for baking underneath the
bronzer and also under the eyes sorry if
you just do use a little bit at a time
it definitely is worth it in my opinion
it doesn't take off any concealer once
you put it down like a lot of
translucent powders do another powder
that I absolutely love is the Rimmel
Stamp Rimmel stay matte powder in
transparent you guys have probably seen
use it's in every single video literally
so I use this to set my concealer on my
eyelid so all the colors that I put on
over the top blend out really easily and
I also uses sometimes to clean up my
bronzer under here like I do with my
translucent powder but this is just like
an easier alternative because it's not
really messy at all but yeah this is
just like a must in my makeup collection
I can't without it and then lastly the
powder that I used to set my face is the
hello flawless by benefit in the shade
honey and matches perfectly to my fake
tan it adds just a hint of extra
coverage and it just sets it perfectly
it doesn't make my face like
over-the-top matte where I look like
someone's just like blown like baby
powder on my face like but it does set
it really nicely and it just like locks
it down I just really like the finish
that it gives it's nice and buttery and
it just feels beautiful now let's move
on to my favorite bronzer
of the last three years my bad this is
the Mac kidney Sun it just blends so
nicely on the skin and it has the most
beautiful color payoff very pigmented it
is a nice orangey bronzer shade so it
looks like you've been out in the Sun
you've got a nice tan you look nice and
healthy I wouldn't say that it is
completely melted has like a tiny bit of
a nice glow in it nothing glittery at
all but it just makes
look stunning if you do have really pale
skin I probably would stay clear from
this as you can see it is quite dark and
it might look a little bit true orange
on you the next fronds are that I've
been using a lot lately is the Marc
Jacobs Omega bronzer in 1:02 it is
absolutely massive the packaging is so
nice that I mean for traveling it's not
the best but the color is really nice
this one is matte I can also skip out
using a contour shade when I use this I
use it as a contour and a bronzer
together just chuck it on and it's like
gorge now it's time for blush I have a
two right here which are really similar
in shade you can definitely tell I have
a type okay I want to break them so the
first one is from Mac and it's in the
shade Atmel by this is just a really
nice corally pink shade I love this
because it goes with every single look
and it is so pigmented like you really
need to be careful with how much you use
and it just blends so beautifully this
is just like a Holy Grail in my makeup
collection and then something that is
much more affordable and is a little bit
more of like a lighter pink shade this
is the essence blush in the shade 10
adorable it is very pigmented it's not
as pigmented as this but it kind of
makes it easier to apply because you can
really just go in and you have to worry
about it being like over the top but
this is just a beautiful like everyday
soft pink and it just adds a really nice
pop of color on the cheeks thank you
is it time to talk about highlighter yet
I think yes so okay this is like the
best phone of 2016 for me this is the
Oprah Beverly Hills highlight off are
you kidding me so it's like a little
color wheel it has black pink white
peach gold and a champagne shade and you
can honestly make so many different
looks out of this one little palette but
the colors that I like to use is a
champagne pink and the really light
color up here so you've got to be really
careful because mate night let me tell
you this is so pigmented that was so
Australian of me but if you put like a
million layers of powder underneath this
it's still going to show up that's the
thing it's that pigmented you don't need
any fixed glass you need nothing you
just need a brush pop it on it really
lightly and you're going to be glowing
like this this is this if I can
recommend one highlighter to you it is a
FRA in the shade Beverly Hills now let's
move on to my favorite lip gloss which
is the Alana lips
a one-on-one appointment I've used so
much of this it's actually really empty
and I'm really proud of myself for that
because I always lose lip glosses and
all lip balms whatever and I never
finish it but this is kind of like a lip
gloss your lip balm in one it adds a
really nice gloss to the lips I'm
wearing right now but it's smelly off
now for some liquid lipsticks I have so
many year and what a surprise they're
all nude I'm so sorry I don't have any
colored favorites because I never wear
them I would have to say my favorite
brand of liquid lipstick would have to
be jeffree star cosmetics he knows his
 when it comes to liquid lipstick
these are so very comfortable to wear on
the lips they're not drying at all
slower or opaque and pigmented you only
need to do one swipe on the lips and the
color payoff is all there I really like
the applicator on there because it's
nice and small and fluffy so you can
really apply it precisely without having
to use a lip liner so my favorite shade
is a mannequin it's a light pink nude
shade it matches every single makeup
look and I think another thing that I
love about these liquid lipsticks is
they don't get like crumbly on the lips
as much as other ones do the other shade
that I love is I'm nude this is perfect
if you want to make like an it's so
distracting
if you want to make like an ombre lip so
when I have a darker nude shade I put
this one in the middle and it just looks
phenomenal I use this with so many
different shades like it works with
everything so the other brand that I
think is just as good I don't reckon
maybe this is the heard of beauty at
liquid matte liquid lipstick this is in
the shade of Venus it's like a nice warm
nude I don't have anything like this
shade it is very beautiful and very
unique the liquid lipstick sorry
Jonathan just had to kick you out of the
house I hate telling when people are
here so sorry about it but back to the
huda beauty liquid lipstick this is an
oil-based liquid lipsticks so it just
applies so nicely and it is nourishing
on the lips next we have this armani
noir it's not a money it's Milani a lot
cheaper than armani okay it is the a
more matte lip cream in the shade at 10
adorable this is so good considering
it's like $7 something like that so the
color is really nice not too light it's
just a nice pinky nude but not as loud
as
hello this product is a very mercy so it
makes it so easy to apply on the lips I
could honestly do it with my eyes closed
because it's not liquidy at all it's
really smooth and moisturizing and the
pigment is stunning okay so I've got one
more product to share with you guys and
that is the Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray in cooling and hydrating
and a long-lasting I love both of these
for two different reasons okay so the
reason why I love the long-lasting one
is because I feel like it just locks my
makeup down in place and make sure that
my makeups not going anywhere
all-day huns so I use this one to like
festivals and clubbing and then be
calling an hydrating one I use this for
like everyday kind of wear so it adds
just like a bit of a glow to the skin it
makes my skin look really radiant not
jewelry at all it just like a radiant
glow kind of thing it's nothing
over-the-top but these are just amazing
and everything I am - so how did you get
some more of that so that we have my
favourites of 2016 and still to this day
everything that I shared with you I
would 100% recommend and it's all just
amazing amazing products I have so many
other products in my cupboard but this
is just everything that just puts the
icing on the cake I'm very impressed
with all of this so hopefully you guys
now have some ideas of the new product
so you want to pick up if you don't have
any good ones of that specific category
I love you guys so much don't forget to
give this video a big thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you in my next video bye
I'm gonna go scrub my channel if I said
that in every video I just love dodgy
tans bye bye
