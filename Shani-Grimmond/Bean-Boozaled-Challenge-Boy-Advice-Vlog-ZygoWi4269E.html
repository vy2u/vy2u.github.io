editing I'm just not enjoying editing at
the moment um that's why I like to do
just very casual videos so I don't have
to add it too much but I'll get back
into the hang of it soon it just like my
editing lacking kind of goes up and down
sometimes I like to sit there and edit
for hours sometimes I don't so I guess
this week I haven't been liking it so
sorry about that guys so today I'm just
doing a very very casual video with my
friend Chloe we're doing like the bean
boozled challenge so yeah very casual
and I hope you guys like it hi cute um

challenge um join me that yes yeah let's
do it
I'm kind of scared because like for
example you have one that's barf and one
that oh that's really close one that's
barf and one that that is peach one
person gets a young one one person gets
a burst one sucks to be the person that
gets the gross ones so let's dream is
I'm just setting my camera on my tripod
so I don't have to hold it because my
arm does not like that let's open the
packet I have my bucket in case I'm
phonics I actually think I might because
I have a weak stomach got me water now
I'm just waiting on Chloe oh oh nice
little hat so this is what we're working
with nice Chloe's ugly little dirty toy

together just so one of them's gross in
one of them is good oh my god oh my god

popcorn or 16 songs that's not like a
combination of like rotten egg and
stinky sauce in it

opinion on like if you got cheated on
what would you do what would you do

change

joke and if they think they can change
they said I can change they can try but
how are you ever gonna trust them again
