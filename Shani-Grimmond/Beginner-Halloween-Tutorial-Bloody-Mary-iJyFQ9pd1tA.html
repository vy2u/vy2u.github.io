time no see I'm so happy to be back well
I'll turn up in a week but anyways let's
go ahead and start with the eyebrows
I'm taking my chi chi brow pomade I'm
just gonna fill in my brows make a
little bit of an arch and fill in any
sparse areas then of course I'm going to
go in with some concealer and just carve
out that brow make it super harsh and
defined I'm just going to really skim
through like the base of the makeup
because I really want to focus on the
fun stuff so of course now just priming
my eyelids as usual and then setting
that down with a powder just so the
eyeshadow blends out super easy on top
now taking a rosy pink shade and a
medium brown I'm just going to pop this
in my crease obviously not being too
needed all because I want to make this
look like bruising I've got ahead of
myself a little bit and just jump
straight into the eyes and like crap I
really need to do the face first so I'm
going to take the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation this stuff is so incredibly
thick I just wanted a really flawless
base if this is the perfect foundation
for that so I'm just taking a buffing
brush and working that into my skin in
circular motions and before you know it
we're going to have a perfectly flawless
face stunning
now going in with concealer I'm taking
the Too Faced Born This Way I'm not
going to take a shade that's too much
lighter than under my eyes because we're
going to put some purple shades under
the eyes anyway so this point really
isn't that necessary but it's a fun step
so now going in with the banana
Australis powder I'm just going to set
that concealer under my eyes and then
I'm going to set the rest of my face so
everything we put over the top once
again blends up perfectly okay so let's
get into the fun part taking those same
eyeshadows as before I will leave the
names listed down below but I'm
basically just going to put this under
my lash line like really messily I'm
going to bring it down a lot so this is
going to be the effect of bruising we're
going to take a few different shades to
give that effect but this was my first
time I didn't really know what I was
doing now taking a darker purple shade
I'm just going to put this over the top
of the two previous shades that we put
down just to add some more dimension to
the bruises and to make it look a bit
more realistic so I am focusing it
around the nose and also the indents of
my natural eye bags because if you do
get punched in the eye I feel like
that's the main places that get like
really purple now going in with a lime
green shade I'm only going to take a
really really small amount of this on a
small pencil brush and I'm just going to
put this on some areas where I put the
dark purple I just googled what colors
are bruises typically and all the shades
are about to use are in a bruise so I
just thought let's just throw a couple
of colors in my face and hope it looks
good so taking some red on my lower lash
line and on my lid then I'm going to go
in with an orange and a yellow and put
this on the bags of my eye as well and a
bit more red you know just do my thing
you also want to make sure that you
blend out the colors with your finger
after you apply it on the face just so
it's not too harsh and it looks a bit
undone just like an actual Bruce board
so now going in with mascara I'm taking
the benefit of roller lash and I'm gonna
apply this like you normally would
then I'm going to put it all over my lid
to make a look
I was crying now going in with a
metallic red liner I'm putting this in
my lash line just to make the eyes look
a bit infected and then finishing off
that it's uh mascara on my lower lash
line really mystically so now I'm going
to go in with some fake tears I'm just
taking any eye drops that I had laying
around the place and just putting this
as I would wear my tear drops would
naturally fall it felt really weird now
I'm going in with the I spy lashes in
the style learn art which is my dog's
name I love that name I'm just going to
pop these on even though this is going
to be a really scary kind of look I
still want lashes alright now taking
some really thick blood this is where it
looks so fun I'm gonna put this as you
would where your teardrops would come
out once again and then just let it fall
naturally down the face to make it look
like you are crying blood now taking a
cotton tip I'm just going to rub this
really close to my lashes with the blood
on it to make it look like it actually
is coming from my eye and then I just
did a one little droplet on the other
side just because I didn't want it to
look too dramatic with like all this but
I feel like this one's a bit more
realistic you definitely don't need to
do this but I just took some black face
paint and put that on my inner corners
and blended it in with the blood you can
use eyeshadow you do not need to get
face paint it was just like laying in
front of me so I was like hey why don't
I use it so for the lips I'm going to
take some foundation and powder to make
them very matte and to blend it into my
face then going in with that dark purple
shade again I'm just going to make that
weird like bum hole lip look that I'm
going to put that really close to the
middle of my lips and some black and
just smudged everywhere just so I look
like a dead zombie or something I don't
know putting a bit of blood on my lips
and then
some red eye contacts in then we are
done
this is definitely beginner friendly I
mean this is my first time doing it
pretty much I did it last year but I
didn't really turn out that well I am
pretty happy with this for like a
beginner beginner trust me I need a lot
of practice but it was really fun so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
you so much and I will see you very soon
bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
