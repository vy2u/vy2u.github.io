promotions and a bottle of champagne
let's guess I think it's from white box
yep
congratulations on a successful launch
of shiny women box wham it was a
pleasure working with you and we look
forward to developing even more together
in the future

 bindi I tell ya just eating my
forever night I'm getting my period sir
chocolate you want some don't you why
are you looking at me like that are you
looking at my bad fake tan hands
Oh guys now it's time to clean the house
it's literally so messy as you can play
back there by my little Bubba series
pram because I want him to have a see me
otherwise he gets cranky
so either like meat Queen I don't have a
bouncer frame so this will do until King
sorry this is the before gross okay so
he's not happy and making him another
bottle he's hungry it's so hard to do
things with one hand right props to all
the mothers out there that have to do
other things other than like be a
stay-at-home mum because it's so hard I
love him so much so here for you guys
asking here's my mum's like best
friend's son best friends daughter's son
so it's like a really close family
friend he's so beautiful I've been
looking after him for a few months now
like for two days like every here and
there kind of thing and I've just grown
such a strong attachment to him and I
just Caravan story mansion I love babies
I caught me tell my own baby but I don't
think I'll be having one for a while
that's wrong yeah because I have a lot
of other things that I want to do every
time I look after him it reminds me that
like you can't really do normal things
when you have a baby so I think I'll
wait until I'm like one owner 2625
I have no idea we'll just see when the
time is right but for now I'm just happy
filming YouTube videos and stuff and
working and from home pretty much and
I'm I don't think having a baby would
fit in with that schedule right now so
Michael went to the doctors to see if
those doctor news arm just like a
shaving brush or something finish his
bottle so I guess I'm just gonna let him
have a little nap because I know if I
put him down he's gonna wake up he
doesn't every time but I guess I'll just
watch some YouTube videos now YouTube
has been so weird lately
like you guys really heard people
complain about it but like Turner what's
happening like videos aren't showing up
in subscription feeds like people are
getting unsubscribed just like a mess
but hopefully it's back to normal sir
freaked me out and something's wrong
with Instagram as well I've only noticed
it with myself but there's been a glitch
with like my photos I don't know he
really cares right now because surely
it'll get fixed ooh doesn't scar oh all
under my eyes so I just did my makeup
because well I won't take the photos for
Instagram so I'm just sitting outside on
the balcony and Tom just sort of show
you my Devon's little plan so we have
two of these ones and then we have some
sunflowers growing I chose that on like
extra large sunflowers so I think these
going to literally be like up to the
roof my bad but um I planted the whole
packet in each one so now we've got like
20 my bad sorry this outfit is from
princess Polly at new clothes is from
Lovisa
and just wearing some people
see lips then we're got some photos so I
just bought a new lens like two weeks
ago and I want to go upstairs and try it
out and see what it looks like it was
really expensive so I'm hoping the
photos of amazing I've taken a few on
there and they look so good so I know I
love just buying like your camera
equipment and stuff and then just
experimenting with it you have been
looking it over is still sleeping and
bindi or at least his side oh and I
taught you got the house a little bit
it's so small so it looks really messy
but I mean you've already trashed it
thanks so Bobbi just woke up and I just
changed him look up Judy is cross knees
arms oh oh what was that oh is that
right yeah
oh you're kicking me you kicking me
you're so strong he's okay
we just took a bunch of photos on my big
camera I had to find a few friends
Instagram yeah so now we're just
relaxing take some fresh air only the
Sun isn't out so we can lay out for five
minutes I had to bring a few outfit
changes I have three for the promotions
the things I do for the gram he's
holding my hand he'll do it he has done
the biggest ever haven't you you
know it someone's got a hold of my
camera string hey hey so I'm just about
to make him another bottle with 16 for
hours and he's supposed to drink bottles
every year for our sustainable chains
but he's just staring at Michael while
he's doing his makeup he was like
screaming his eyes out because he
realized he was hungry decided crying so
I was like gotta get a bottle and
then I moved him and now he's just
staring at Michael he's not doing any
more right now he's staring at me
why are you looking at are you hungry
another bottle I swear babies eat more
than adults yeah we've got baby
I think someone's getting tired can poke
yourself in the eye oh you're too young
to hold your bottle stop it so I'm just
sitting outside getting some fresh air
just as a sleepy at the moment and I've
got to take him home in 30 minutes
because it takes 45 minutes to get to
his house and I need to be there by 8:00
so it's like not too late I just want to
make a couple cuddle here but I don't
want to wake him up obviously that's
mean and I've done my research with
babies before I looked after him and it
did say one of the worst things you can
do is make a baby out while they're
sleeping I always used to do it to my
little brother and sister when I was
like I was 10 when my little brother and
sister were like newborns and I
bethought him all the time it ever since
I look after my little brothers and
sisters I was just obsessed with babies
like I've honestly been obsessed with
babies since I was a fetus like since I
was a baby myself
I love them so much I know what it is I
guess some people like have a weird
thing for babies and that's me he know I
have an ingrown toenail
I get ingrown toenails literally once a
month it's so annoying
and I always might open shoe so I don't
know how I'm getting them it's just like
you know please
the little boys waking up all right okay
okay but more me you're an actual bitch
you know
anyways guys so we just dropped justice
off I'm really sad I honestly miss him
already but we're gonna go home and go
to Melbourne Hotel which is like a
really nice actually no it's not nice I
mean it's a bit yeah just like a pub
like I love pub meals so much for
delicious I make a steak chip salad like
that's where I feel like right now
