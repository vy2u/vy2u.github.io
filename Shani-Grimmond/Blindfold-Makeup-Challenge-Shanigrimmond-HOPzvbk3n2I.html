front of me and then I have my blindfold
here so yeah let's jump into it
I feel so across to phobic oh my hair oh

foundation and a little bit of eyebrows
mascara but since we are going for a
party look I do want to make it flawless
so I'm going to find my foundation yep

just going to put a little bit on the
back of my hand a little bit oh god are
you ready for a fullest face okay I'm
trying not to get in your hair she
really doesn't want in her hair I don't
play my I wouldn't either this is so
difficult
oh my god sorry I get your nose nose
hole okay so no I don't know I'll go on
to concealer I'm really having trouble
finding it sorry
I found the concealer this is the Rimmel
stay matte one I do remember putting
that in the pile yeah I'm just going to
pop this under her eyes because I do
like to highlight as a lot of you guys
you know it's my thing off
not my fave um mmhmm yeah I just like
that highlight finish and I might put a
little bit down the center of your face
because we all like that highlight honey
so blending it out just so it's nice and
seamless as I say in my videos uh-huh
drop to me brush okay so now moving on
to bronzer I'm just gonna be contouring
her cheeks a little bit because well
when I go out to parties and stuff I
like to have a strong contour for you
yep I love my brother
it's my favorite deafs my favorite
actually my favorite makeup item would
have to be mascara what are they for you
if you even have one fat like one thing
what would it be in makeup actually my
bronzer just runs out so you will crown
your ashes and from them you look like a
baby really love the bronze effect duck
oh wow
so it's really good with the aisle I'm
sorry it's like a sudden solariums
besides I really baked not fried you
have an egg head like me so it's kind of
difficult to figure out what's what like
that's your jawbone obviously okay well
now I'm getting a little bit of
highlighter marry glue on top of the
cheekbone so that Gorge summer glory I
really want to do your eyeshadow now oh
there it is wait I'm trying to find my
palette now moving on to I hope to be
doing I think a pink eyeshadow look
because I know that's very flattering I
think that topper is pink so how we do
is second oh that's a snazzy color it'll
think about you sure the camera oh sorry
guys Casey mm pigmented look that's the
Morse effective why does that feel
sexual excuse my crop size I like the
only reason I can actually feel for your
islands cuz your long eyelashes poking
at it okay so I'm going to take a little
bit of probably this color and just put
on her lower lash line so this is a bit
of a dangerous part don't want to poke
her in the eyeball on that would have to
be eyeliner
you'd really yes of course
what's eyeliner without a flake okay
other I putting my little finger on her
lashes to make sure the lines very very
neat as I'm sure it would be I have a
scar I'm just super Scout of poking an
eye out I'll just do a very very careful
job oh did she like it yeah tada Tilly
Whitman head
okay so there's gonna be really
difficult cuz I know one sides why and
one sides black sir she's ain't gonna
have like our final smashes all really
beautiful long ones oh it's like I'm
crushing your little tentacles feels so
cute let's just brush them puppy dogs I
feel like it's the most effective way I
just wrapping the head during it is a
gosh um not quiet eyebrows let me try
and find this eyebrow product now to
draw these bad boys on and our Kourtney
likes house dark with her beautiful
blonde hair sorry let's just do this I
have multiple eyebrows
okay now I'm taking some lip liner type
at all no oh oh I'm hoping this on her
lips
let's get them nice and plump that's
like a vagina okay I don't know everyone
loves that emphasize keep his bar so
let's do this it's like a McDonald's
fine love it okay I'm not a mess we're
ready to look at this oh god my little
eyeballs are stuck together
