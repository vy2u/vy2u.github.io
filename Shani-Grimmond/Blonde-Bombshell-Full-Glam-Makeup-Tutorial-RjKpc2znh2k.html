my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a makeup tutorial on the look that I'm
wearing right now I love it so so much
it's like a really nice rich cranberry
smokey eye sho look with a pop of
glitter on the inner corners a nice nude
lip
glowy face and I thought I'd pair it
with this wig it's not real hair it's a
wig and I'm also wearing eye contacts as
well I just thought I'd play around a
bit and change it up so I hope you guys
liked this video and let's go ahead and
get started
girl look how big that transformation is
so today I'm starting with a fresh face
the first product that I'm taking is the
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac I'm just
going to use this to prime my eyes to
cancel out the discoloration and to make
sure the colors go on super pigmented
over the top then I like to go ahead and
set that Paint Pot just so the
eyeshadows blend out really seamlessly
and then it's time for the eyeshadow so
I'm starting out with the makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade at Peach Smoothie
and I'm just going to take this on a
really fat fluffy brush and focuses in
the crease this is going to be the
transition shade it's going to make sure
all the other colors like blend out
seamlessly together the next shade is
called bitten by makeup geek as well
this one is going directly in the crease
this would have to be the main color it
is so stunning it just blends so nicely
as well so just taking that in a
windshield wiper motions until it's
super blown out
the next shade I'm taking is from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and it is called
burnt orange it is such a beautiful warm
brown shade so this is going just above
my crease to really smoke it out and to
make sure that cranberry shade blends up
really seamlessly the lip color that I'm
using today is called showtime this is a
foiled eyeshadow so it's really nice and
shimmery so just packing this all over
my lid and of course blending it out to
make sure again there's no harsh lines
there is a lot of blending in this eye
look now time for my favorite part which
is taking a q-tip and some makeup
remover and just cleaning up that line
it literally just changes the whole
entire look so now moving on to the face
I'm taking the Bobbi Brown in
vitamin-enriched face space Chris makes
my skin so moisturize and just nourished
I love it so much for my primer today
I'm taking my Smashbox photo finish
primer water and I'm just spritzing this
all over my face and my god the spritzer
is broken so it went on in like some
massive chunks but the foundation I'm
taking the deal air flash foundation it
was kind of messy when I was applying it
like it was when it's bright on the
brush would like come back in my face
and then if I sprayed it on my face it
was like and now it's just little bit
messy but so far I really like the
formula I have the shade 300 and that
seems to be matching really nicely the
coverage is really nice I just I know
about the spray can it be in a liquid
form that would be so much easier
I definitely do see myself really
falling in love with this product though
because the finish is so beautiful and
like flawless and this brush it just
applied it so well this is easily the
buffer brush I think it's called I will
leave all the products that I'm using in
the description box if you guys are
interested but man this brush is good
for concealer I'm taking my urban to
skin of wayward like I haven't decay
naked skin concealer this is the best
concealer I've ever used I don't know
how I haven't finished this up because I
use it like nearly every single day but
the coverage is just so nice and it's
also really moisturizing under the eyes
as well and it doesn't crease or k-cup
it is just in sane and membrane and
saving that membrane
now taking my Mac prep and Prime in the
shade lack boost this is just a really
light yellow highlighting shade I'm just
putting this down the center of my face
blending it out and this just makes the
face look so much more dimensional and
incredible now taking my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick this is incredible for
cream contouring it's just the perfect
shade so I'm putting this under my
cheekbones and also around my forehead
to really bronze it up the color is just
so perfect it makes you look like a
goddess
a bronze goddess my god I don't think
I've ever started so much in my life now
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I just had to buy a new
one of these I finally finished up well
not finally because it's expensive but I
use it that much that I thought I would
have finished it months ago so just
baking under my eyes to make sure that
concealer doesn't crease and also down
the center of my face as well
love this step so much for the brows
today I'm taking the essence eyebrows
stylist set this stuff is like 6 bucks
it's great
so just filling in my brows as I
normally do making my arch a little bit
longer making them a tiny bit thicker
for the lower lash line I'm taking that
same crease color in the shade bitten
and just putting this from inner corner
to outer corner to really proportion out
the eye shadow look
then taking the shade a hot chocolate by
Anastasio Beverly Hills I'm just
focusing this really really close to the
lash line to make it that teeny-weeny
bit darker now it's time for the fun
part
gelila so I'm taking my to face book
glitter glue just popping that on the
inner corners and then I'm taking my Mac
pigment this is a beautiful beautiful
pure gold pigment so stunning I'm just
going to pack this directly over the top
and it just makes the look look ten
times more glam ten times more girly and
fun I love this stuff so much you guys
need to get this pigment ASAP rocky for
mascara today I'm taking my benefit a
roller lash and just coating at my top
and bottom lashes so we can prep them
for those falsies to highlight my brow
Barry I'm taking the makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade light life this
is so pigmented so I'm being very very
light handed with this step for the
lashes I'm taking my favorites by who -
beauty just popping those on and you're
going to look 10 times more full-on
which is how I like it
to contour today I'm taking my Bobbi
Brown at bronzing powder this is a
beautiful beautiful shade to contour so
just under my cheekbones chiseled out
and also Domino's because this brush is
just so quick and easy to contour the
nose it's great and was $80 oh God then
I'm going to bronze up the skin this is
the Mac in the shade
give me Sun it is I'm sure you guys have
seen me use this a million times but
it's just the most beautiful shade to
bronze up the face make it look like
you're super tanned the colors just
perfect it's not too orange it's not
true bronze it's just
Lauren JH it's great yeah it's great for
and my forehead as well why not
I went a little bit overboard with my
bronzing it came down a little bit so
I'm going to make sure to bake because
this just cleans up that line and it
makes the contour just look ten times
more sharp which is what I'm moving for
next step is flush this is in the shade
Melville this shade honestly matches
every single makeup look I always see
myself lean towards it it's extremely
pigmented so be careful if you do get
this product use a very very small
amount so just putting this on the
apples of my cheeks to add that really
nice pop of color okay we need a second
to talk about this amazing product it is
the artist couture highlighter in the
shade yes it's kind of like an
iridescent pinky purple and it is so
pigmented and so amazing definitely one
of my new favorite highlighters you guys
need to check out this brand oh my god
living just brushing away all of that
fake age and bam we are snatched I love
the way this makes my skin look next
step is to set my face with the urban
decay at cooling and hydrating I feel
like this does soak up any excess powder
as well and makes the skin look a little
bit more dewy so for the lips I'm taking
the essence lip pencil this is such an
amazing amazing product and the shade is
perfect as well it's like the perfect
nerdy pink
next I'm taking the two-faced are melted
liquefied long wearing a lipstick in the
shade I'm just going to pop this all
over my lips it is a really nice shade
but I wanted to put a few different
colors on to get the perfect nude so of
course I went over with my favorite
liquid lipstick by dose of colors this
one is in the shade sand so it's more of
a cool tone nude so I just pop this over
the top and then I finished off with my
Nick butter what my next butter gloss in
the shade Madeleine now it is time for
the funnest part of all I'm going to
Chuck on a wig this is a blonde like
long a bob and it looks so cool what
kind of looks real don't you think it
may be a little bit too blonde for me my
eyebrows are definitely true dark to
match this wig but I mean I'm here to
work I kind of made it work so I hope
