channel I hope you're very well so let's
go ahead and jump right in and we'll use
the huda beauty palette which by the way
I'm obsessed with and I'm just going to
take this a medium brown shade is
honestly the perfect transition shade to
start off any look it literally works
with anything so I'm just taking my
favorite blending brush it is the Mac 2
to 4 and I'm just going to go in from
outer corner to inner corner and really
blow out that color so I do take a
smaller blending brush and blend out the
edges just to make sure it is absolutely
seamless the next shade I'm going to
take is Abbasi which is like the perfect
to observe a new shade it is feel
stiffle so with the same blending brush
I'm just going to pop that in the same
place with the brown but I'm not taking
it as high what I do want to make that
crease really rich and smoky honestly I
use the huge Beauty palette all the time
but this time I was just blown away I
think this is I've been using so many
palettes at least I really noticed the
quality of the shadows oh ok so now
taking the black shade which is the best
black I've ever used it is just so easy
to blend out this one is going to go
mainly on the outer corner I'm going to
take it in the crease very lightly but
focus it mostly on the outer corner so
now we can go in with most favorite
product in this whole video this is a
stealer magnificent eyes oh my god I got
too excited and I started doing it I'm
like wait a second I need to fix the
eyes before I even go into this so I
decided to go back in with that fuzzy
shade and just pop that on the outer
corner so that Stila product has
something to blend into so now going
back in with my and main bitch and I'm
going to cut the crease it was so easy
to do that I was honestly really shocked
it was really pigmented I only literally
have to swipe it once and all the color
was showing up I just love sparkles it
gives me life so we had a bit of drama
here so I did my whole face and I'm like
oh my god it's really not working out I
was trying to really like blow out
the outer corner of the shadow boat just
looks ridiculous anyway so I just
decided to take it off and just do a
winged liner so we can clean up that
edge without like a really sharp line so
I'm going to use the bomb and the Kat
Von D liner to make a wing I never do
wings so it's like I know it took a half
an hour to do this but I just thought
shiny you can do it and it turned out
pretty good so I'm really happy with
that
I just can't film it yet so give me a
break so now let's move on to the primer
I'm taking this one from Golan oh my
gosh I cannot say anything I swear to
God
so just popping that all over my face
it's really expensive I don't know if it
works or whether is that it was
expensive and I need to use it up and
get my money slapped in Keene so now for
the concealer I just put a little bit
over my nose to make sure it was really
covered like all of the freckles in
there because usually so they should
never stick to minor so I thought I'd
try this trick and see how it goes
so now it's time to foundation I'm
taking this one from Clinique I love
this foundation so much I wish I
discovered it sooner it has a really
nice coverage it does a little too cakey
and it's really comfortable on the skin
so back to the tight shape take
concealer I'm just going to conceal
under my eyes as per usual this is the
best concealer in the world I'm sure you
guys already know that because everyone
and their mums are obsessed with this
product I swear to God so make sure you
bake or set under the eyes if you're
doing concealer otherwise you're going
to have a creepy mess under there and
you don't want that so I'm just using
the laura mercier translucent powder I'm
also going to use this to set the rest
of my face as well because I'm like oh
why not it's already out honey and then
of course the lower lash line I'm going
to take the same shades that we put in
the crease so I'm taking basi add a
corner to inner corner and then I'm just
going to go in with a black shade and
focuses on me at a half of the lower
lash line I really just want to smoke it
out because I did have that winged liner
on for mascara I'm taking the top
mascara this stuff is incredible just
coating my top and bottom lashes so we
can get ready for the falsies are you
guys ready for this these ones are from
Lily lashes they're so fluffy and poor
just like oh I love Little Ashes so much
just going to pop these on and the whole
look is just going to look smoking
now I'm going to take the Smashbox
contour palette and with the lighter
shade in there I'm just going to
highlight underneath my eyes just for a
little extra some you know me I always
like to put a hundred layers of makeup
on now I'm just going to take the a warm
tone shade in that contour palette and
I've been really enjoying using warm
tones sort of cool tones for the contour
it just looks so much better in my skin
tone so I'm just going to take an angled
brush and put that underneath my
cheekbones to make them look that little
extra bit defined and then I'm taking a
bronzer from Todd I found this in the
back of my cupboard and I'm like oh why
I know uses this one is called at Park
Avenue princess it's a really nice color
for just bronzing up the skin it has
little shimmers in it so it just gives
that sunkissed glow it's absolutely
gorgeous so just on my cheekbones and of
course around the forehead and jaw line
if you want your contour to look
snatched as hell and make sure you go in
with a highlight shade and just clean up
underneath that bronzer make sure that
it's a really nice sharp line nothing
too dramatic I mean most of the times I
go overboard and I have to go back in
with my bronzer brushing you know just
give it a bit of a bust but this makes
it look very crispy clean honey now
let's move on to the blush this one's
from it next I love the next ones
because they're so affordable and they
work just like a high-end blush I feel
like people are going to get up me for
saying NYX is it NYX I don't know now
it's time for my favorite part I'm
taking this deal of starlight Starbright
palette and I'm taking the shade kitten
and of course I'm going to throw my
brush with a fixed glass and then go in
on my cheekbones and make them very
bright you guys are going to lag what
that is so much Cola or what come on
come on it's made it's shiny I used so
much highlight all the time
on my cheekbones and of course on my
nerves to make it looks like a little
Butler's
a whole happy and then for the lips I'm
going to take the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on lip pencil in the shade at 1993
and I'm just going to really over my
lips today I was just feeling big juicy
lips so that's what I did this lip liner
is so creamy I love them so much I would
definitely recommend them so now let's
move on to the liquid lipstick oh my god
how beautiful is this shade so unique
it's not just like the typical new if
you know what I mean it's still very
wearable but it's
oh just that little extra pop so of
course I'm just going to go in with DHS
restart I'm nude liquid lipstick just to
brighten up the middle of the lips
because I did feel like it was very
distracting from the eyes and I wanted
it to tie in together so lastly I'm
going to go in with this wire so
lipgloss oh can you see how cool will
see that is this is everything pinky and
to finish off this sexy look I'm going
to take the shade kitten again and
highlight my inner corners I felt like
it just needed a little bit of a pop on
the inner corner and oh my girl girl I'm
so happy I'm so happy with how this
makeup turned out it's probably like one
of my favorites
mainly because that winged art that way
usually I don't do wings because I have
falls in my eyes and I want to get stuck
in the fall with it look so bent and not
not cute okay honey so I'm really proud
