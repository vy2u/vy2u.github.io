ahead and jump into this bronzy and
makeup tutorials so I'm just going to
start out with my NARS concealer this is
a very thick concealer it is new and I
love it so much for priming the eyes
because it covers absolutely everything
so to set that down oh my god I dropped
it I'm just using my Rimmel stay matte
powder I shattered it everywhere so I
need to get a new one but this is just
going to make sure all of the colors on
top blend that really easily the first
color that I'm going to use is from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and called
orange soda I just want to make sure all
the other colors can kind of like blend
into this color so I'm putting this a
little bit above my crease with a fluffy
brush and then the next shade I'm going
to take is from Anastasi as well at this
one's in the shade at caramel and I'm
just going to really start to deepen up
the crease with a bigger fluffy brush
and just work it from inner corner to
outer corner and blow it up nice and
high and then I'm going to take the
shade side pick this one's from makeup
geek so I'm pretty much just putting
this in the same place I just wanted to
build up the colors darker and darker so
it was easier to blend so the next car
I'm pegging is also from makeup geek
this one's called cabin fever it is a
really nice rich warm brown it is so
stunning so just on a smaller blending
brush I'm going to focus that directly
in the crease and I'll take it too high
and really pack it on so I did go back
in with that original crease color and
blend it out the edges a little bit so
it was a nice dark to light radiant so
next I'm going in with the violet vodka
the glue and I'm just going to pack this
all over my lid and then on top of that
I'm going in would be a makeup geek
supernatural foiled pigment this is a
very beautiful bronzer shade so just
packing that right on over the top and
cleaning up a fallout and also the edge
of the eye shadow so it's nice and
sharp and clean now it's time for the
face I'm taking this a Bobby Brown at
vitamin-enriched face face I use it all
the time and I'm nearly done but because
I do have dry skin I wanna make sure my
face is super hydrated so the foundation
goes on really smooth on top next I'm
taking my tights
smoothing primer this honestly made my
skin so soft I'm really loving this one
now for foundation I'm taking the a
leglock stick foundation in the shade
warm beige and just putting a lot of men
because I do want full coverage and then
blending it in with a kabuki brush and
the finish of this was so beautiful it
just covers everything evens out the
skin and I love the shade to match my
fake tan neck or during a fake tan neck
was very dark I put way too much or not
just like a wash off one and it didn't
really work out but we'll bronze the
face up later just setting my brows
would be tint my brow by Astralis in the
shade a light brown I just wanted to
lighten them a little bit and also make
sure they're sitting up nice and high so
they look very texturized now it's time
for concealer I'm taking the
heart-shaped Cape in the shade
light/medium this is the perfect shade
for me it really highlights under the
eyes and for so colored and new sort of
discoloration this stuff is very full
coverage if you guys haven't tried it I
would definitely recommend getting it it
is my favorite favorite favorite
favorite concealer in the world next I'm
just going to bake under my eyes using
the s-bahn powder this is really great
if you're in a budget it is super
affordable and it works very well so I'm
really impressed with that and then
we're going in with the Australis full
coverage freaking powder this honestly
is so full coverage it's amazing so just
studying my whole entire face and this
also does make your face very much as
well
for the lower lash line I'm going in
with a sidekick from makeup geek from
the outer corner to the inner corner and
then on top of that to make it a little
bit darker I'm taking cabin fever which
was the darkest shade in the crease and
just going straight over the top with
that so it's nice and smoky and then of
course it's time to mascara I'm taking
this one from Mac it is a really good
for the lower lashes to really get into
every single one so if you darken up
everything even more I took this black
eyeliner from Stila and just put that in
my waterline
of course I'm going to pop some a
massive lashes on these honestly just a
random pair of hand in my cupboard
anything works so now let's move on to
highlighting the inner corner I'm taking
the Australis metallics eyeshadow in a
shade of gold Gaga and then on top of
that I'm going to put the Macklin in a
shade of gold just so we have a really
intense pop of light color there and
needs to work so beautifully together
now it's time to contour and taking this
program palette from its heart and I'm
just going to take these sculpting shade
with my knives either brush and just
carve out my cheekbones this brush I
think it's the last time I'm going to
use it because it always makes my
contour looks so intense and because I
naturally have really defined chief
burns
it just looks crazy although it is
really good for contouring the nose I
will give it that okay so let's move on
to the bronzer I'm taking this Oprah
blush flash bronzer in a shade of bronze
in gold it is so beautiful and it's
going to put this on my cheekbones
around my children and foster on my
hairline to give my face at the ronzi
effect but I would have to say this
bronzer is one of my favorites which is
saying a lot because I do lots of Mac
runs is so incredibly much so this is a
big thing to me guys for the blush I'm
taking this one from a covergirl this
one's in a shade 590 it is so beautiful
it's a really nice rosy pink and it has
so many shimmers in it so the face is
honestly like blinding already but of
course I had to go in with another
highlighter this one's from the Tarte
palette as well and it's called it lit
so I'm just going to put the touch art
doing this on the brush and that's an
active like a Mac 6
but that's it a mac's fix+ and make it
even more intense surges on top of my
cheekbones and also on my nerves as well
to make sure my face is literally
glowing and blinding you and of course
to make my face even more glowy I'm
taking that touch I are doing this and
just spraying it all over my cheeks so
to highlight the brow bone I'm going to
take the mac eyeshadow in a shade nylon
and just take a little tiny pencil brush
and put that flat underneath my eyebrow
I never do this but I think it looks
very pretty for the lips today I'm
taking the Urban Decay 24/7 at glide-on
lip pencil in the shade insanity this is
a really nice nude that group of so many
different shades new depend on I mean so
I'm just going to outline
my lips as I love to do this formula is
very buttery and easy to apply and then
for the actual liquid lipstick I'm going
to take the plush cream by makeup geek
in a shade jetsetter this is a very
creamy formula so it's not going to dry
out your lips it is very moisturizing
but I feel like the color was a little
bit too Brown so I went in with this
essence lip gloss it's a little bit more
pink and just pop that right on top so
my lips look even bigger and just do you
see you know what I mean so I hope you
