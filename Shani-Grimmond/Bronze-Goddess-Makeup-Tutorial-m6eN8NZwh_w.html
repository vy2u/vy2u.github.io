whole world at our feet
hey guys it's Shani and welcome back to
my channel so let's go ahead and jump
straight into this tutorial I'm gonna
start by tanning and I'm just gonna
moisturize my whole entire body with my
Vaseline moisturizer this stuff is
incredible because it just soaks into my
skin straight away so the reason why I'm
moisturizing before my ten is because
I'm using the bondo sands wash off ten
and it can be kind of dry so you want to
make sure your skin is nice and
moisturized so we can just glide on
super easy and this stuff can get very
dark very quickly so you want to just
take your time and just be careful with
this one it is a really nice color but
sometimes it can be hard to match with
foundation so just do a little bit by
little bit and you'll be all good
can someone please tell me what that
little peace sign is right there I have
no idea but the turnin is done let's
move on to eyeshadow so I'm starting it
by taking my MAC eyeshadow in the shade
so this is going to be the transition
shade so just taking this from inner
corner to the outer corner just in
windshield wiper motions
next I shadow I'm taking is from the 35
T palette by morphe it is a few shades
deeper and Walmart it is absolutely
stunning so this is going directly in
the crease just a bit lower than that
transition shade to add some depth and
of course once that's blended we're
going to blend it even more with a
fluffier brush just so it's nice and
seamless and of course my favorite step
of them all I'm going to clean up that
eye shadow line with a damp q-tip and
then I'm going to choose any bronze
shade from that same morphe palette
there are so many different shades you
can choose from it is just a bronze look
goddess palette so I'm just going to
spray my flat shader brush with some
fix+ so it's super super intense and
pigmented and voila will go pretty it is
nearly finished with the eyes I'm going
to go ahead and blend that crease one
more time just to make sure that
shimmery shade didn't come up too high
time for the skin I'm going to take
these simple kind of skin hydrating lip
moisturizing lotion this stuff has been
a holy grail of mine for so long now but
is incredible just to keep the skin nice
and glowy next step is priming I'm
taking the Laura Mercier radiance primer
I just want my scene to look through the
glowy and goddess Laxus is perfect next
step is the Josie Maran I think it's
like illuminating face stuff I got a
little sample of it in so far so good
but when I put foundation over the top
I'm not too sure if it does peak through
you guys can be the judge of that
now it's time for foundations so I'm
taking my Giorgio Armani and my Marc
Jacobs foundation so I pretty much just
took a few that look like they would
match to my neck to get the perfect
color match to my fake tan the finish
was really nice at the start but by the
end of the day I'm pretty sure it was a
mark J who was one that had really
oxidized so that kind of sucks I'm not
really a huge fan of that foundation but
the Giorgio Armani one is amazing it
actually looks like silk Livan and don't
mind me I was trying to look all cute
with my hair down low but that never
lasts for too long and also up it goes
in an ugly fun and I can't stress to you
guys enough how much I love beauty
blenders you guys need to get one if you
don't have one they're incredible now
time to contour I want to be extra
bronzy so both step is cream contouring
i'm going to take my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick this is the most
beautiful color ever I love
step I do it in like pretty much every
makeup routine that I do its goopy now
taking my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer this would have to be one of
my favorites of all time it just hides I
just have no words for it it hides the
under-eye discoloration really well and
it also brightens up the eyes at the
same time whilst being hydrating so
again using my trusty old beauty blender
to blend that out yes time to set that
concealer I'm using my favorite one
which is the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm sure you guys know
that by now it is still pretty full so
I'm really impressed by that so just
setting that with a pretty blender and
straight away as well to make sure it
doesn't crease under there at all no
thanks honey
and also if you do bag under your eyes
make sure to leave it for about five
minutes so it just really sticks it
really glues your face so next step is
to finish off the eyes I'm going to take
the Mac saddle eyeshadow again run it
from inner corner to outer corner and
then to deepen it up I'm taking that
same crease color and just popping that
on the outer half now it's time to add a
beautiful gold shadow to that inner
corner just to make this a bronzy look
pop even more I will leave all the
products that I'm using in the
description below if you guys are
interested of names or anything like
that next step is mascara I'm taking the
cover go the super sizer mascara this is
one of my favorites it has an amazing
butterfly wand it's just so easy to
apply it's really wiggling that in
zigzag motions in my lashes
now to highlight under the eyebrow I'm
going to take the Mac eye shadow in the
shade at vanilla extract it is super
shimmery so I'm just giving this very
light handed because we already have a
lot of shimmer going on I mean come on
look at that so when I do my eyebrow
highlight I always go in with a really
clean fluffy brush and just quickly
blend it out to make sure there's no
harsh lines or anything like that
and of course now according my lower
lashes with mascara I put so much on my
lower lashes it's crazy I feel like it
just makes the whole entire look
complete time to whip out that
contouring powder I'm taking the hoola
by benefit this stuff is insane it is a
staple in my makeup collection and
should be in yours as well so I'm just
going to contour under my cheekbones and
really just sculpt that out really
sculpt it now it is time for the fun
part so I'm going to take my Mac bronzer
in the shade it give me Sun it this is a
beautiful shave anyone that has a
similar skin tone to me it is just super
bronzy it is a little bit orange but
it's like the perfect amount of orange
so just under my cheekbones on my
cheekbones around the forehead around my
jawline everywhere just go crazy with
this step
now just to add a teeny-weeny pop of
color to the cheeks I'm going to take
the makeup geek blush in the shade
infatuation it's a really nice peach
shade it's nothing over the top so it's
absolutely perfect then for my favorite
part of the whole makeup look is
highlighter I'm taking my Becca
highlighter in the shade champagne pop
oh my god just look at that glow it is
stunning I think it is definitely one of
the staple things to like a bronzy
goddess kind of look I'm putting this on
my cheekbones on my Cupid's bow jealous
under my face on my Knowles everywhere
I'm gonna shine like a diamond now time
for some beautiful fluffy full lashes
that these are the Lilly ghalichi lashes
in the style Miami my friend Michael
gave these to me when he was doing my
makeup well I stole them I didn't give
them back and they're the most beautiful
lashes I've ever used I'm gonna have to
get some bulk orders on that website now
taking my Mac lip pencil in the shade
boldly bare I'm just going to outline a
little bit I feel like my lip fillers
have gone down a tad which is kind of
disappointing maybe I'm just getting
used to them I'm not too sure what this
color is great for any nude or pink lip
it just works with so many different
colors so oh my gosh this is the best
part of the whole look I swear I got two
new liquid lipsticks they are stunning
so when you mix them together they just
look like the perfect nude and I just
wish it they would make this formula
into one like please do that for me just
but yes there we have the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it this would definitely have to
be one my favorite makeup books that I
have ever done I just think it's so
pretty and girly sorry for the long
intro by the way I was having a lot of
fun editing then I realized it was so
long conceited
no I'm not actually like editing I'm
