I'm just gonna blend out the edges okay
so the next car I'm gonna take is called
a Dipple it says darker hot pink right
here and I'm just gonna bring this one a
little bit lower than the last pink and
also on the outer corner here learn it's
gonna look like I have pinkeye after
this so when I was in grade 8 I think I
literally had pinkeye for 6 months I
couldn't get rid of it none of my
doctors knew what was going on I tried
like every single eye drop I went to
like specialist and everything they had
to like open my eye with this like weird
machine to flip my eyelid it was
thinking about it I'm like getting
uncomfortable like that's how wait it
was that machine but I ended up going to
like this random ass doctor and they
just pulled out a few lashes and the
lashes were glowing like this way like
into my I like how wait am i I was like
rejecting it so they kept going really
red and stuff oh my god I dunno how I
got to that story but okay so now I'm
gonna go in with some concealer I'm just
gonna cut the crease I'm just gonna do
1/2 cup crease I think today yeah I just
do that sir I'm just gonna take off any
excess concealer and then just kind of
Pat the edges and then I'm gonna go with
this color right here this is like a
really nice champagne a pink it looks
amazing
sir I'm just gonna go straight over the
top with this such a pretty shade this
brush is honestly the best for pecking
on color on the lid it is the Mac 3 for
7 ok then I'm gonna go into light a pink
shade and I'm just gonna use this to
blend the two colors together
please blend for me please honey
I'm calling Michael
hi I really need help because I can't
blend that bit right there I don't know
what to do oh it's Christ yeah no it's
like I've put the pink curve at the top
to blend the two but it's like can you
see that what chunk there I mean I would
love to blame that but I think it's the
way I budgeted of something okay so
let's move on to the face I'm gonna take
this primer from Sicily this was like
one of the most expensive promise or I
really just like want to use it up older
I'm gonna leave my makeup on all day so
this is like a bit of a waste but every
squatted on my hand so I'm just gonna
start the wedding they seen it live in
my face I'm going for a facial tomorrow
to get needling so my face is going to
look absolutely insane tomorrow
I got needling like a month ago I'm
gonna stop getting facials every single
month and my skin was like healing and
like just going crazy after that
needling but I'm gonna keep getting it
just to see if my skin like reacts we
need some serious like color correction
on my face cuz I just put tan on my neck
any what's new let's see if I can
actually match it probably not this one
is the Clinique beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer I love this one
so much this one's in the shade 11 honey
I used to use this all the time oh my
god you can hear Lena's like little
claws across the ground I'm sorry hungry
there's some because I'm going crazy you
can probably hear it I think I might use
a brush for this one sorry I have been
going out every weekend for three weeks
now absolutely amazing I wouldn't know
if you guys like going out if you do or
where you go do you like going to clubs
do you like going to bars cause I know
like when you go to clubs is like a
really loud music it's so hard to talk
to your friends so recently I've been
going to like little bars and stuff
she's so much fun you set them out every
Monday if I got in Sunday I'm out for
the whole day on Monday because my hair
was horribad and I always eat so much
through the next day because I'm like I
need something to distract me from me
being hungover oh my god this actual
foundation is so good if you guys
haven't tried it you need it in your
life
ASAP oh my god I'm so excited for this
concealer it is the new Tarte concealer
it's called the creaseless concealer I
have the shade medium and medium golden
I think I'm gonna use the shade medium
but the packaging is super cute I wonder
if this is gonna be better than the top
shape check it's gonna be interesting oh
that's those really smooth coming out of
that like wow okay wow it's really thick
nice it'll literally shut off my rack
okay well oh okay well it has a really
really good coverage happy about that
well I guess now we'll just see how it
looks when it set so I'm just gonna do
some baking I'm using the lip Prarie
powder it's like the best translucent
powder in the world it's so expensive
there I'm also going to bake my laugh
lines because they're just out of
control actually out of control and then
to set the face I'm going to use the
Australian flawless powder in a shade at
darkest Brown this stuff adds a bit of
coverage at the same time setting the
foundation all right girl let's go in
with the lower lash line so I'm going to
take the shade electric on the bottom
I'm just gonna grate and then I'm gonna
go with this brown shade this is the
transition color and I'm just gonna take
this underneath that pink I feel like
I'm sorry chill today every time I'm
super chilled every was like what's
wrong I'm fine I'm great I wonderful
living my best life to be honest with
you I just chill I always like to relax
I'm doing my makeup I think that's why
people think that something's wrong like
but I'm doing my makeup I'm like super
like laid back and then when I'm doing
like a Q&amp;amp;A on something I'm like full of
energy what a concentrate on you know
so next I'm just gonna take the shade at
Trixie right up here and I'm just gonna
use this to highlight
corner just a little bit so because I'm
putting on false lashes I'm just gonna
go in with this taught a man-eater
eyeliner liquid liner and I'm just going
to line my waterline just quickly just
so you can't see the lash man you know
what I mean oh I found some new favorite
lashes I've already wore them on Sunday
night but I think they're in my bathroom
I'm gonna go get them into the month
that's a good okay we do not recommend
this eyeliner that just started bleeding
all over my eyeshadow
okay so I just got a little hmm I just
went ahead and put my lashes on these
ones are from the brand Gemma Isabella
and they are honestly my favorite laughs
at the remember these ones are 3d mink
lashes what's wrong with these in don't
please tell me she doesn't say okay okay
sorry let's move on to the bronzer
I've been using this one lightly and
it's really really good it's the Mac
Studio a care blend slash pressed powder
in the shade of dark
I remember Jaclyn hill said this was
like really good like years and years
ago and it's literally just like a
powder in a dark shade but I just like
how it looks for my skin tone it adds
really nice like natural definition to
the face but obviously I like to build
it up so it's really dramatic
oh this brush as well is amazing it is
the morphe M five-30
nice and small so I still have a lot of
control over where the bronzer goes so
we're gonna take this around my forehead
cuz my neck is a little bit darker so
I'm just gonna warm up the rest of my
face so then what I like to do is go
over the top with the BH Cosmetics satin
bronzer in Tangled
and this isn't my oh I'm not giving it
back
you literally came over yesterday and
took makeup out of the box that I have
on the floor which is all my new makeup
so thanks mate yo mate I never say that
going on yeah this just adds like a
little bit of shimmer to the face and
that's exactly what I want
oh this blush has been oh my god this is
Mathis as well this has been my favorite
blush like a good month now it is the
Tom Ford blush in the shade in
inhibition love that now this is like
the perfect neutral blush that goes with
every single makeup look it's very
pretty and cuz I have pink eyeshadow
when I can go crazy
okay so then I'm gonna go in with the
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray in long-lasting I've been doing
this every single time I like to go with
that and then the highlighter of the top
okay so I'm gonna go with the benefit
gold rush highlighter it is a warm
golden nectar blush on some blush looks
like a hot it's me oh got a nice that
looks are oh maybe it is abortion well
it is because it says it is
oh that's sorry pretty over the top with
that one I'm just gonna take this rose
gold and gold together and I'm just
gonna pop this right up here Oh put in
the wrong shade okay so I have this hot
fairy dust right here that I kind of
want to put like on the inner corner of
my eyes oh you can put in your hair as
well that's cool oh that was sorry
pretty there's like all these different
shapes and sizes and stuff in there okay
cool let's do this that's like true pink
that didn't work out but instead I'm
gonna go with the in your dreams
cosmetic glue this is a clear one I just
want to see what this looks like nervous
I'm nervous
time for the lips I'm going in with the
immaculate pencil in the shade spice I
haven't used this in so long and it is
honestly one of the best lip liners for
like a really nice when you eat lips oh
yeah first of all stop I might like over
line them a little bit as well if you
guys ask you well not asking everyone's
just assuming not everyone like three
people I'm just being dramatic people
are saying that I've got cheap filler
I've got nothing in my cheeks the only
thing that I have is my lips or relax
okay so on the lips I'm gonna go with
the Kylie cosmetics matte liquid
lipstick in a shade exposed you're
exposed you're expelled
this is actually a really nice lip color
and I forgot about it sorry let's just
going it makes like a nice ombre
I just want to look glowy I'm gonna take
the mac fix+
pink lunch it has like a little shimmers
in it just let it fall in my face
because I don't want dogs on my face

lot of jewelry on this is from coke I it
