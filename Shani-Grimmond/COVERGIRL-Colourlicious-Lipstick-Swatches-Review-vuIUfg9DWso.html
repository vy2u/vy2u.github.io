in today's video I'm doing a review and
lip swatch on the covergirl colorlicious
lip sticks there are seventeen that I'm
going to be swatching so I'm really
excited because I love these lipsticks
so covergirl actually reached out to me
to do this whole video for you guys so
this is sponsored just letting you guys
know but I would never do a sunset video
that I'm not like genuinely in love you
know with the product so let's go and
get started so shall we start with the
review the first thing that I have to
say about these lipsticks the packaging
is so nice it's just super sleek and
simple and that's what I like to see in
lipsticks so as I said before there are
17 different shades in the disarrange
and it comes with like four different
color families so we have like more of
the nude colors we have pinks like fairy
colors and red so you pretty much have
everything that you need right here
well including the others so you guys
know how many lipsticks that I have in
my collection I have so many different
shades but it's really cool because this
collection has a lot of unique shades
that I don't actually have which made me
so happy so it's really cool just
experiment with different colors cuz I
love lipstick at the moment I have a
cold sorry my lips have been extremely
dry and so and cracki so I prayed
through my mouth when I have a call
because obviously my nose it's looks so
I'm like Jonathan says it's like really
annoying when I sleep sorry about it but
this actually has shea butter in it so
it keeps my lips are really moisturized
I have one of the nude lipsticks on now
and my lips feel like I have a lip gloss
on it it is crazy and also you guys know
that I'm obsessed with things that are
pigmented and girlfriend and these are
so incredibly pigmented and they're very
long-lasting as well like you'll know
that I like to eat a lot and this
actually holds up pretty well when I eat
which is impressive what can I say the
last thing that I have to say about
these lipsticks before we get into this
watching is that they are oh my god wow
how did that happen
anyway so that they have sixteen and
ninety-five each you can get them from
Kohl's Big W Kmart
Woolworths and Priceline I am so hairy
myself remembering
quit so shines way that's not how you
say it's like Kudo oh yeah Kudo coudl
okay so I'm gonna start by switching the
nudes and then make my way to the darker
colors so just like I'm gonna butch like
all of the names but at least they have
numbers on there as well whack creme
creme creme creme I don't really know so
my thoughts on a nude lipsticks you can
pretty much work with like every makeup
look any outfit it's gonna go with
everything because it is so like subtle
and leg back I feel like everyone can
pull off the nude so these would have to
be like my favorite shades to wear
except red love red so the first
lipstick is what I'm wearing on my lips
right now it is true 30 creme creme the
things I already watched it so it looks
like this it is just an extremely pale
and nude color it reminds me a lot of
the Mac in the shade myth it is
seriously so moisturizing but obviously
all of them are because they have the
same formula I promise I'm not going to
say that about every lipstick the next
color we have right here is a true forty
caramel kiss so as you can see on my
lips right now it is still a really
bright nude color but this one has more
like pink undertones in it
so it is like a pinky nude color this
one is gorgeous next we have a true 4-5
honey bloom I feel like this is the
perfect nudie pen color so it's just in
between those two shades it's definitely
a lot more of a darker pinky nude than
the other two that I just showed you so
it's not as like blank on the lips so
know how this started the video I was
saying that there's some really unique
shades in here this is definitely one of
them so this is 265 room it's mold this
is like a new team of color I see a lot
of purple in this one and also has like
a little tiny shimmers in it so it makes
my lips look extremely glossy very
unique now moving on to the pink family
so my thoughts on things are like nerdy
things you can wear with anything it's
pretty much the same with the nude
shades but when it comes to like bright
Pink's I definitely think this is like
amazing to just add like a pop of color
to your makeup or a pop of color to your
outfit like for example if you're
wearing like a black and white like
boring colored outfit a public color on
the lips is the way to go this one is
390 sweetheart blush so this is a frost
finish so it has like little shimmers in
it and it glows it literally looks like
a little disco ball on my lips so it's
just like a really nice light pink color
next one is 400 waffleicious so I feel
like this is a
subtle like a candy pink color I knew
why but when I look at it I feel like
lollies like candy fairy floss maybe
yeah this one definitely is a very
wearable like dusty rosy pink color next
we have 365 and Chandra splash I think
that's how you say it so this one is a
frost finish I feel like it is just a
pure barbie bright pink next we have
more of a darker rosy like Barbie pink
shade this is a 4:05 temptress rose this
one is for one five delight blush this
is just a staple pink and I feel like it
has a tiny bit of a very tinge to it
moving on to the Reds and the coral
shade so we have full right here I feel
like coral shades are extremely unique
and also really easy to pull up because
they're not too intense and then red
shades are like the most amazing
flattering lip color to wear I think you
can wear it with so many different
makeup looks so many different outfits
and it just adds that beautiful pop of
like elegance to your face red lipstick
and new lipstick mm-hmm this one is true
ad Destin teach and I feel like this is
definitely one of the most wearable
colors and the whole collection it is
just super casual but still is really
really pretty so it's like a peachy
coral shade next we have at 285 it's
sweet tangerine this is a corally orange
color this is something that is
extremely unique and I feel like
everyone has to have in that collection
I mean how many people do see bring this
lip color next is 295 a succulent cherry
straight out just a staple red I have so
many of these shades in my collection
because I love it so much as I said this
is something that kind of makes your
whole makeup pop so I wouldn't wear this
with like a colored eyeshadow because it
kind of clashes as you can see I have
purple eyeshadow when it doesn't look
too good with the red lips but this is
something I'd wear with like a smoky eye
or neutral eye so the last one in the
red packaging is 3:05 hot cello girl I
cannot say that one so this one is a few
shades deeper than the one I just showed
you so it's more of like a bloody turned
red does that sound gross well I think
it looks good so the last color family
we have right here is the very purpley
shades I don't see too many people
wearing these shades so I think it'd be
nice to like change it up I'm obsessed
with really dark lips so these with
death
up my alley I love wearing these
lipsticks to really make my makeup look
extremely dramatic because well it's
been real these are pretty dramatic
colors next we have a shade at three to
five this is a berry color but it also
has a lot of pink on a turned in it so I
definitely think it's still like
wearable like don't be too scared of
this color I know a lot of people are x1
is 3/3 ish ravish raspberry this is like
a deep very purpley color but I also see
a lot of like a brownie most shades in
it next we have at 3:35 tantalized t
Taylor I'm not too sure like that's a
really odd name so this one is just like
a super I know how to describe this one
it's really unique it's like a purple
with a little bit of a very own attorney
I'm sorry guys what I seriously can't
not make my lips look like I have a pass
rush cuz of like rub it in so many times
that's what we have here is 315 this is
a really deep dark purple and this is
what I love this is what I'm talking
about by like a pop of color like to
make that look even more dramatic so now
we have my lip swatch review on the
covergirl colorlicious lip sticks I hope
