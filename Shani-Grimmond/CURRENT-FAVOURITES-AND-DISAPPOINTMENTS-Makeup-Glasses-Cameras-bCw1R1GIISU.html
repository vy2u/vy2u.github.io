today's video I'm doing something that I
haven't done in the longest time so I
have a bunch of a monthly favourites
that I really want to share with you
guys because these products I've started
good that I had to share them with you
and I literally haven't done this like
taco video in at least a year so this is
a third cool and I also have a few like
misses products just a few products that
I don't really lack and that didn't work
for me and I thought it would be cool to
share it with you guys sorry without
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
the video let's go ahead and start with
the eyewear I'm so excited about this
because I've partnered up with the
glasses usa.com to show you guys a few
different styles and stuff and this is
definitely something that's like I look
different to what I usually do like I
had to get running to help me choose
these frames cuz I'm like I don't know
what's gonna look good on me so let me
show you a few of them so the first pair
that we have right here is in the style
at Celina these ones are really cool and
they fit perfectly with my face as well
but what are you guys seeing oh my god I
look so smart it's really hard to kind
of see because of the light but I'm
gonna take some photos and put them on
my Instagram if you guys wanna have like
a better look but the quality of these
feel it's so amazing I feel like this
style in particular is one that I'm
going to be wearing the most just
because it's like a basic black frame
and it's gonna match like heaps of
different outfits and looks and stuff
but when I'm doing my makeup with
glasses I think what I'm gonna do is
just focus on like big lashes and a bold
lip because I don't want to like I don't
want too much going on with the eye
shadow in the glasses and then what the
eye shutter and the glass is like
clashing so if you guys do want to see
like a makeup tutorial with glosses
makeup then let me know the next style
that we have of these ones right here
these ones are a little bit more on the
pink side I'd have to say these are my
favorite just because I feel like they
kind of sit on my face the nicest
because I've got a big fat head the
really cool thing about glasses usa.com
is you can upload a photo of your face
and you can choose what frames you want
onto the photo so you can see what
they're going to look like before you
buy them and they also have a 365 day
warranty so like if something goes wrong
you are covered and they also have free
shipping returns and 100% money back
guarantee girl they got you and the last
pan that we have on these ones right
here I love the shape of these ones so
we have a clear face and
black sides sir they do ship worldwide
and they also have a little special
discount code for you guys so I will
leave that down in the description below
if you guys are interested the next
product that I have to share with you is
amazing when I went to Bali a few weeks
ago I got this oh my god my school and
school I got this Polaroid because Lux
gave it to me which was so nice of them
and I just love the color of this it's
like a pastel yellow color and I've been
collecting Polaroids over the past few
weeks and it's just so amazing to have
an actual hard copy of a photo I have a
few photos right here but yeah that's
something that I'm definitely going to
be doing a lot and I know I'm so late on
the bandwagon of Polaroids but this one
in particular is incredible it is the
insta max Mini 8 I love it it's so easy
let's take a photo now
okay so we have some makeup products now
the first favorite is this a Bobby Brown
highlighter this one's in the shade pink
glory and oh my god I haven't found a
great highlighter like this for the
longest time so this one's like a
champagne e pinky pearly shade the
reason why I love this is because it's
so finely milled my hands are like so
much paler than my face cuz I have fake
tan everywhere else but there's just so
many highlighters out there that are so
chunky and textured and make your skin
look really bumpy but with this one it's
so intense like you could definitely
make it a really intense but it still
looks like a really beautiful glow on
the face without like it looking like
you've got a million pounds on your face
you know I'm sure you guys saw this
coming but this one is the BH Cosmetics
satin bronzer and it's in the shade a
tropical tan this is so incredibly
affordable I don't know if it's replaced
some Mac give me Sun but it's definitely
definitely up there and it's like
probably more than half the price anyway
so this is a beautiful like orangey
bronzy shade I love those type of shades
for my skintone it just makes the skin
look very radiant and just sunkissed and
I love the little sparkles that it has
an X it's not like glitter it's just
like a glow you know what I mean but
this is out of this world like if you
guys haven't tried this you've got to
try it right now
trust me the next thing that I've been
loving this month well actually for a
few months now it is the benefit of
Ready Set brow this is a 24 hour
invisible shaping and setting gel so
this one doesn't add any color to the
browser it literally just like a makes
them look a very textured so it makes
them look a bit more full so what I like
to do is just push them up so my brows
look thicker and they just sit in place
all day they look so neat and kind of
like more effortless because they're
going upwards instead of like length
flat on the face and it just makes my
brows look amazing I cannot do my makeup
without setting my brows with this stuff
it is so good like yeah joking I never
thought that I'd be putting an eyelash
color in a favorites video but this one
is just incredible it's from mecca
cosmetic car
mecca cosmetic asar recently my lashes
have been like kind of falling out and
I'll tell you why soon and when I curl
my lashes with this they just go so long
and they look amazing I honestly
couldn't live without this obviously you
can get like really affordable eyelash
colors but I mean they do break
sometimes
one is a really good quality one and I
love that it's gold as well it's so
pretty next we have some lashes that
I've been completely obsessed with so we
have three brands right here the first
one is by lash warriors and there's no
like specific style or anything that I
like this brand in meticulous is so good
because all of their dramatic lashes are
so full of looking I hate when you have
lashes that are really stiff and just
look very fake it's so fluffy I won't
die but yeah these ones are really good
quality and they lost so many uses very
impressed with these and then the other
brand that we have is kind of like more
on the natural side it's what I'm
wearing right now but they definitely do
have a lot of volume to it they're just
not as fluffy they're more like when you
don't feel like having birds sitting on
your lashes but you still want to look
hot AF so this is the brand right here
it is Kuro I can never say anything
right are you guys even surprised I mean
I've heard me I'm saying that right but
yeah these ones are kind of like the
Adele lashes of like my dramatic lashes
you definitely still get a lot of length
when you're wearing these it's just that
they're a lot more comfortable than any
other lash you've ever tried because the
band is so thin and I'm just like a
workwear of things being my whole life
please the last favorite of the month is
this glam blur blur set up makeup
setting spray the reason why I love this
is because it makes my face feel so
refreshed and the spritz on this is the
best spritzer out of any ready mmm
it is the most finely milled spritzer
I've ever seen in my life like literally
I don't have any problems ever with like
any chunks of like product going in my
face it just goes on perfectly and it
feels so amazing it smells so fresh and
I love it okay so we have two misses for
this month and usually I give all of my
misses away things that I know it likes
so next month I'll make sure that I kind
of like to put it in a little pile so I
have more for you guys cuz I do go
through a lot of products that I don't
particularly like so the first thing
that we have here is the House of lashes
eyelash adhesive and this makes me
really sad because this glue is actually
it's so good for sticking on the lashes
but the problem that I have with this is
that when you take your lashes off all
of the glue literally get stuck in every
single lash and to get the lash glue out
I'm like trying to like really carefully
like wiggle it out and I pulled out so
many lashes trying to get this
I've tried everything I've used like
micellar water I'm a cut remover I just
want something that like comes off with
my actual fake lash not sticks my real
ones you know what I mean this is sorry
sad because it is so good but it's not
worth like having no lashes is it all
right okay so the next thing that we
have is the Kim kardashian-west beauty
contouring and highlighting sticks I'm
sure you guys have seen my review on
this and I was not impressed at all
they're just really dry like one of the
contouring shades is fine but then the
other one is the most muddiest thing
I've ever seen like I had to put so much
bronzer over the top so like the
muddiness would kind of like tone down a
bit and just the formula of these are
just like they don't work for me so I'm
really disappointed in these but I do
love her contouring powder palette that
is really good not gonna lie oh my god
I'm so bringing that glam glow stuff but
the highlighting shade in here is like
the lightest stick that you can get and
I highlighted my face with it like my
skin tone is pretty dark the moment cuz
I have fake tan on and it didn't even
really highlight at all whoa okay so
that is over my hits and misses I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
want to say a massive thank you to
glasses usa.com
for sponsoring this video because it
means so much to me and I think the
glasses are so beautiful sir I will
leave everything that I talked about in
the description below I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in my next video
