unfollow him on Instagram if he's like
I'll call him kind of regret this our
club by a minute octave AP um is that
what is is it true that what you told

you're lying about Lea dogs I think it's
cuz they're actual humans especially if
he know he's our very not he's or not
I'm gonna try and like eat with my mouth
closed like it's really hard okay how
much do you spend weekly I don't
actually spend a lot of money new dog
Hey on the other hand he's like oh I
can't go today because like I'm waiting
for an order from far fetch which is
like an online designer web web I'm
gonna bring that out one day you
bitch you're getting anxiety when you go
out to the mall learn yeah you don't
ever go out by yourself - you know wha
every time he wants to grab the shops
he's always like calm otherwise I just
water it online
mhm I go to shops about myself all the
time I'm doing it a bit like I think
everyone gets a bit maybe not everyone
but like sometimes it's scary people are
just scaring but like what's one thing
you hate about each other's makeup
routine you stupid eyebrows this sorry
Dom I like my eyebrows the guys let me
know down below who has their eyebrows
okay therefore guys we got it the other
just looks straight so this is the
filler candle
oh yeah oh my god it's fish I
used to hate fish but now I love raw
fish makes your tips for right know what
you need that was just
really as if that's young well you're
like this like an every fish but not bad
next question is do you guys ever get
into arguments like serious ones and
what's the longest you two bond before
we explain that in my video literally a
week for two weeks two weeks it was at
one week I remember go to service pages
to get over yeah who's your one call in
your shoe you smell mom
negative and positives about being an
influencer the hardest thing about it is
people's intentions when you meet
someone new you never know if they're
using you for followers for their own
growth or if they actually like your
personality and actually care about you
you know what I mean yeah that's really
like the most important thing to me was
when I'm friends if they're genuine sir
not yeah that's the West I never let any
people in yeah and it sucks cuz I want
to hear that right good night
what the left right good night
haven't you heard of that I know what
the weird I'm going me a weird
are all the things that you do bindi did
you check out the sauce
I throw it out oh I'm so excited oh my
god did you not have just invented a
thing that gets clipped into this that
you that fits in that when you're
driving you can dip your nugget into the
buggy a tray for the sauce you
definitely don't know how to drive you
know any crashes Carlos Lee someone ran
into you didn't they yeah still your
phone hi Brett don't eat my nuggets they
were for us I'm getting no more than two
how much do you guys actually know each
other like do you get deep into dirty
with each other secrets yeah all right
he knows me really well he's very closed
but I still can read an open book you're
not an open book
you're a closed book but I can read
everything he does so it's funny yeah
literally we have the exact same person
I think that's sometimes why we clash
yeah
but you can't agree sometimes literally
I mean saw you you're like sometimes you
act like you beyond saying when you're
actually not oh maybe that's that's
really dramatic like my dog I'm not
anything this is so yummy okay me not to
say they say that you can keep a Mac as
burger in your handbag for up to two
days and then still eat it it's good
that's how that is
I should probably do that how the labs
changed since your old get ready with me
with each other how you close up more
mature PS love you shiny but not Michael
is all they wrote love you bye
Oh oh my god that would be like yeah I
think we're more mature for sure I've
moved houses like I'm very independent
we're starting to really like I
literally applied for this place by
myself like I did today hell I do it all
by myself everything out like he's maybe
I'm like a month by a week two weeks now
this Friday I meant to be me
oh my god today so I'm yeah I'm saying
all the papers tomorrow's gonna be
amazing it's a new house no one's ever
lived in it before so there's no like
bad vibes
yan'er like spirits or something like
that would be scary that's my biggest
fear literally a lot n is what you
haven't considered me being with Michael
bah canard he said he'd never movie with
me I couldn't I couldn't leave him with
anyone unless I was like madly deeply in
love with you and you were penetrating
my ah so 2,400 a you're like a
 very veil oh yeah we have good
lighting out here
bye everyone you're really traumatic I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give it a big thumbs
up girl everyone's leaving work scaring
yeah yeah so let me Gary w-what in my
next book bang or if there's any like
sort of topics you want me to talk about
I don't think I had Michael back on a
just because I care smells so okay I
love you guys so much just one following
dirt fly him oh my god you guys she got
on play hand I'm kidding if I always
