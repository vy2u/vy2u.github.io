through and usually I always hot it I
think when I like okay John just said to
me he's like we should get Tigers
tonight because I said to him the other
day I'm like I really want to get like a
super meaningful court some way I've
really really small my body and I'm
usually always being against getting
tatters just because like I were to
change my mind with things and like I
don't think he'll love it forever but if
I get a tattoo that means like a lot to
me like a really nice like meaningful
quarry I think like I know I just think
that'll be nice because like I'm always
like either anxious or uncomfortable
what he just forgot so I said to him I
was like we should get matching tattoos
because I just want to see what he's
gonna say and he just sent like five
texts or I'm just going to I want to
pull over so I can read it I feel like
this is gonna be so interesting alright
let's see what he says
haha of what I'm going to put an
Instagram story to to see like wouldn't
Harry places off wait so like he's legit
considering it he just said haha of what
I thought he'd be like get oh my
god imagine if we got matching tattoos
no I would never get a matching today
with someone that's why I thought he
would say and I just messaged the owner
of like beginning boutique and I was
like hey hon just letting you know I

what he would say these songs I could
just relate so much I mean I thought I
could read it really I was literally
like 16 I was like I was like 19 years

his music in like his lyrics but like
not only that even like when I was
already this guy and like everything I
was still with just his voice is out of
