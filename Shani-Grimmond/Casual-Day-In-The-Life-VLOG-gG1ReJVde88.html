going to be doing a vlog of like my
everyday kind of day um I haven't really
done one in my new house so I thought I
would just bring you around with
whatever I end up doing today it's
probably going to be nothing special but
I do want to like vlog this weekend and
go somewhere fun so I can like actually
vlog an exciting day so I literally just
woke up and it's freaking 10 o'clock 10
o'clock
I slept even so late oh well um so today
I would really really want to film an
apartment tour because a lot of people
are seem to see one so a lot of people
have been asking if the pill has been
working for me if you don't know I went
on the pill like a month ago or
something yeah month ago now because my
emotions were really like me all over
the place and I had really bad breakouts
so my emotions have like completely gone
back to normal thank God so that's
worked for that part and my pimples are
still pretty bad but they are not as
near as bad as what they were so I feel
like they're slowly on their way to
getting better thank God so I feel like
in I would say like a month my skin is
going to be clear again it's just
because I've been eating like so much to
put oh my god I need to clean oh my gosh
I need to clean the whole house
to do this apartment tour ok for a
second right now I need to tell you the
new face what should I've been using
it's so good I use the Cetaphil every
day gentle cleanser it's oh my god
amazing and I'm just brushing my pigs
and yeah oh my gosh I need to clean this
shower it is so dirty and my makeup room
what happened BOM has hit it man a bomb
has hit it oh my god mmm okay so because
I'm the Lord for vlogging today I feel
like um covering my pimples because I
flop in having people just stare at them
so I'm going to try out this new stuff
it's what is it wait so for everything
focus you piece of dog here we go it's
the BB cream radiance 9m 1
and I just thought I'll give it a try
and I've seen what happens
and who would have thought that I'm
going to be talking about makeup in this
video is that a surprise oh my god that
color match isn't literally perfect look
well compared to my fake tan oh I love
planning like new good products like
Hello
all of the BB creams that I usually use
elect B so I literally will have like a
pink face and I'm just like come on what
are you doing right now I'm actually
really impressed that BB cream it worked
so well to just give like a lack
coverage so now I'm going to just go to
my P o box because I have mail in there
seriously first thing I do is like a
little bit put my moisturizer on prepare
a box because usually there's like
makeup in there and I love makeup
okay so this is what I picked up from
the Pai box I literally have no idea

dear next level hungry we have like no
food at the moment it's what I was
thinking of making poached eggs because

not many people that I know input
vinegar with the poached egg but like
I'm a baller so what can you say to step
number one step number two salt and

filming in corney's room because she has
aircon and these lights are so hot oh
and before I feel my video I just want
to show you Zhang Sheng wushu because

poached eggs and it is 5 o'clock in the
afternoon so I finished that first video

corn is home hey doll hello I'm doing
the apartment tour tomorrow because the
Sun went down and I missed the bright
skies so
so I'm at mums now because I need to use
her Internet to upload this video and
also the one that I filmed today can you
hear my car if you can hear that boiling
that is my car overheating every time I
Drive it overheats and mom's house is
like 30 minutes away so 30 minutes up to
100 doesn't look like it even though I
put Coulomb in it today but I'm actually
getting a new car in like hopefully like
three weeks I'm going to get a
Volkswagen 2015 automatic polo
I'm really excited to do that because
I'm sick of this stupid piece of
car honestly it's like 1995 so it's
older than me it's like two years older
than me what is it like 20 years old
poor little darlin whoo but at least it
gets to point A to D it just doesn't get
to point A to C or Z only those short
distances but that's okay okay so I'm
just going to make some dinner I'm
thinking of just having like a cheetah
tuna toasty because mom doesn't have
much food moment sir this is my little
sister Haley do you love when sissy
comes over

me yeah why doesn't like to talk too
much on camera - even as soon as that
camera goes off I'm not I'm just
stealing my little sister's room for the
night now so I'm watching um Kathleen I
think that's how you pronounce it her
videos on YouTube she's definitely my
favorite youtuber over laughs at the
moment like I seriously obsessed with
her and all of her videos if you guys
like makeup kind of videos then you need
to check her out oh my god and she
uploads so much as well um what else do
I have to say oh my god and also I turn

um but the time being I'm just gonna sit
in my room and watch Revenge until two
weekends and then I can go out yeah I'm
actually like hyperventilating yeah um
