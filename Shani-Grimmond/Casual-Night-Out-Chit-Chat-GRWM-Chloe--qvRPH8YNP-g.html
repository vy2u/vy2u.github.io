put it on my back of my hand so I can
like control how much I'm putting on the
face and then I'm getting the cursive
sense
buffing brushes on I ate from the 22
piece brush set no just pull it up like
that
so with just the leftover someone up
scoop it back into the bottles where it
wastes any just and will use that just
to like cover up some kind of fish okay
so I'm just going to put some bronze
around her cheekbones to make them look
a little bit bigger I'm just going to
use an angled brush from Coastal Scents
I lifted like a bomb okay I let you put
you in okay so if you're like if you put
too much on or whatever I can just go
back and blend it when your foundation
brush okay so now I'm just going to put
some highlight on just using this chichi
kit ah you can get like any white or
like really shimmery white color and you
do that I'm just using this brush to
apply it

Napoleon powder to black finish our
foundation off and real techniques I

five two and just apply some color you
want on the base okay now I'm just going
to apply some brown just any shimmery
brown color just like this one okay so
she's going to put a head back a little
bit so it prevents any fallout

Stewie we're gonna go back and get a
blending brush I'm just going to use the
Real Techniques buffing you know uh sure
thing I know it's called I'm going to
take some really light color just to
make a little bit bigger and I want to
put that in the inner tear duct area
with this tiny little brush you're going
to do
I'm going to take a darker color just
through that add a crease just to give
us some definition I'm just going to
take a darker Brown in the first one we
used and just put a little bit there
just like the out of me
and then I take the blending brush and
blend that out just so it's not ok then
I'm going to take the lightest color on
the palette and a highlight brush and
just get a little bit of that and then
on top of the brow bone

brown eyeliner and put that under her
waterline just
