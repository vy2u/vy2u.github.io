done
um no coming up I got my lips on like
two days ago actually yesterday and
they're really really swollen still so
if you're wondering why they look really
big and purple and stuff that because um
they're freshly freshly squeezed yeah
especially squeezed orange juice but
they will go down a lot so don't be
scared if you're like what's happening
how can they look good like that I don't
I don't want them to go down at all I'm
all about that big lip life I know that

happens hahaha so I'm using the modern
renaissance palette from and it stars in
Beverly Hills this is Michaels I'm so
