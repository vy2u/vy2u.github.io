bit I like the body I stood the grip I
said coffee when I sum up my crazy got
me I'm the Swami I see him get to keep
it that night gonna bet my soul of it's
like nice officia when I like with a
bitch this way welcome to my channel
sorry in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a makeup look that I actually did
yesterday wasn't even dressed at anyone
what I have for dinner this I've lost
the plot like I don't even remember what
I had for breakfast like I have the
worst memory oh yeah I went to get
extensions putting my head just like a
hilar so it's not like clippings of like
the famine or anything I already cut
them out now but um I thought they'd be
good for like when I go out and I want
long hair because I cut away Harold
which is so sad but I'm yeah I was
liking my makeup yesterday so I thought
why not go ahead and film it and I have
a lot of new makeup here to try and also
a lot of like my favorites that I want
to share with you guys as well so yeah
I've already gone ahead and prepped my
face we've already done moisturizer and
like exfoliated my face and stuff I just
quickly want to talk about what I have
been loving lately because my skin has
been pretty bad for the most part for
the past like yeah ever since I've been
off the pill and I've been using Java
logica for such a long time now and I
absolutely love working with them I love
their products so much so I just want to
show you what I've been doing with my
skincare routine or at least my favorite
part of this can carry teen at the
moment um if you guys do want like a
full-blown skincare routine let me know
in the comments below but this is what
I've been cleansing my face with every
single morning it is the Gemological
daily it's super foliot and stuff is
incredible especially for me because I
have sensitive skin and I don't want to
like dry my skin out too much using
products that are too harsh so this one
really gets into my pores makes my skin
that's so nice and clean and so soft
it's crazy so it's kind of like a dry
like sandy it kind of like feels like
sand but it's like a softer version of
that because it's so finely milled so
what I do is put a little bit in my
hands
and with my wet face I then take that
product and like kind of work it in so I
always like avoid my eye area and I just
massage it into my skin for about a
minute and my skin always feels
incredible
so of course you guys can use the
courage shining 20 at checkout at
Dermalogica com don't know you if you
guys are interested in trying out some
of their products but now that my face
is all prepped we can move on to the
pickup okay so I just went ahead and put
some eye drops in my eyes I'm getting
sort of red okay so let's we want to be
eyeshadow I have the new huda beauty of
rose gold palette the ring mastered
version so this one is the new and
improved formulated and there's also a
few new shades in here as well I tried
it again for the I mean I tried again I
tried it for the first time yesterday
but I do want to try it again I didn't
have the best time with it so I actually
filmed the whole video and then at the
end of it I was like No
so I used like this gold chin up here
and it just didn't really work with the
brush it didn't look foiled like I
wanted it to so I don't know I'll keep
trying and see how it goes but today I
literally just want to use one shade out
of here I'm gonna take the shade at
sandalwood I'm just gonna keep it super
basic with the eyes because I want to do
a really big black wing um but yeah
these like all the matte shades in here
blend out so incredibly beautifully
actually I've only used like four of
them but as you can see right here like
it it literally takes no time to blend
out these shutters that's why I'm like I
have such mixed thoughts about it
because all of the matte amazing like if
I was to come out with an eyeshadow
palette I want my eyeshadows to be
formulated the exact same like that's
how good it is whatever I'm not gonna
come out and I should've l it um but
it's just like the top row of shades and
hey I'm just a bit maybe I have to just
like just keep trying and see how it
goes yeah I'm just gonna blend this one
into my crease to add a little bit of
definition in here who's taking a really
big blending brush by the way this is
the first video I'm filming in my new
house it feels so good my background is
kind of
the same by like different suicide now
it's time to go in with the eyeliner so
I'm taking these Stila stay all day
waterproof a liquid eyeliner this is the
black one in the shade intense black
here what guys my lashes have been
fooling out like nearly every single day
I don't know why but I'm not gonna have
any lashes left okay so I'm just gonna
go ahead and do a wing okay so now that
we have some really wonky wings I'm
gonna go in with the DVD palette and I'm
just gonna take the black shade and this
is what we're gonna use to make the wing
look really smoky and we're gonna make
it look more even sorry I'm just gonna
take a little angled brush a really thin
one like this and kind of just draw it
above that black so we can make it look
a little bit smoky but this black in
here is so good makes it kind of easier
if you guys are new to my channel you
should just know that I'm really bad at
wings sir you know retail which is
something it doesn't match my eye shape
like at all
the only problem is when I look up the
eyeshadow transfers onto my hooded eye
so we are gonna move on to the mascara
so I'm gonna take the Mac I don't know
if this is a new mascara I think it is
it is the bold and bad lash looks like
this so we have a little tiny wand on
once on like the top and then underneath
we have like a little bit of a smaller
ones right here so I'm just gonna go
ahead and cart my lashes so we can put
on some false guys I'm actually obsessed
with my new place like I'm just so glad
I got out of that that anymore you need
something so much bigger the lashes I'm
taking are Amber Rose lashes they look
like this I've never even heard of this
brand famous to do but this is what they
look like here very long I think this is
perfect for this look so I'm just gonna
trim them a bit oh my gosh these are
huge I just have some black lash glue
we're gonna go in oh like spiders now it
is time for the face makeup so I just
got the Marc Jacobs invisible undercover
perfecting coconut face primer I've
actually wanted this for a while now so
I'm excited to see how this feels on the
face it literally just looks like a
moisturizer all feel so nice and cold
my skin is really dry sir I'm liking the
form you all
oh sorry please ignore my ten on my neck
right now she's the one for longer than
awake sorry
it's definitely a problem that's why my
hands are a different color as well cuz
I washed my hands up like literally
every two seconds my tan comes off so
quickly on that okay that probably feels
like really light on this skin so I'm
liking that but I guess I would just
have to see how holds my foundation now
I'm gonna go in with my favorite
foundation in the world it is the
hourglass vanish stick in a shade warm
beige oh I can't get away from this you
also love the color as well when I
haven't
stock fake tan on I've literally gone
through like three of these sticks or
eight guard I just apply this with a
kabuki brush gonna dab this in because
um my acne scars are a bit traumatic at
the moment I like to go for a pretty
full coverage foundation if I am gonna
wear foundation I'm going for a facial
after this so I'm really excited because
I'm getting needling on my face which is
amazing for fading all the scarring so
it's exactly what I need it is time to
lighten up the face and give my face a
bit of definition so I'm taking the
Bobbi Brown instant full cover concealer
in the shade at sand so I'm just gonna
pop this under my eyes I really hate how
the formula it's like really dry but
it's such a good concealer I didn't
really sour oranges foundation well
until today that's random I think the
lighting in my new filming room is like
a lot better and it's like the natural
light is like all over here so I'm
really seeing the color difference right
now I'm just gonna go ahead and blend
that in with a Beauty Blender good so
the purple mists under day hon oh my god
the black is already transferring up
here that's so sad I'm also gonna take
this down my nose and on my chin my nose
doesn't hold on to a foundation or
concealer so you like don't know I had
even bought that but the thought that
counts right I'm gonna go ahead and bake
underneath my eyes I'm just using the
old Prairie cut up stuff isn't my
favorite even though it was like $280
for a table bellick means what use it if
i'm good at right then going in with the
astrologer fresh and flawless pressed
powder I'm just gonna shut my face this
one's in the shade darkest Brown I used
to use this all the time oh my god you
know what I just realized I don't have
any of my benefit what is it hello
flawless powder left I use it every
single day Wow you wonder why I've been
feeling so lost lately or have any
laughs really dramatic shiny my god it's
just some really sad day to be you like
transferring her well no you guys the
transition coma
hi now I'm just gonna go in with the
shade of sandalwood again and I'm just
gonna put this on my lower lash line
just to add a little bit of color here
Oh beautiful well that black is just
gonna go straight back now I'm just
gonna go in with the Australis taint my
brow this isn't a shade blonde I just
want to make my brows a little bit light
off cuz I sorry dark right now I'm
thinking about actually like bringing
some blonde up heal to make my hair a
little bit lighter oh wow that really
did make a difference in it go good know
what do you guys think do you think I
should stay dark we'll go in a little
bit later and then it's time for bronzer
I'm taking the Mack bronzing powder in
the shade refined of golden I've been
using this even more than my give me sun
shade which is incredible so I'm just
gonna start putting this under my
cheekbones if you're wondering why
that's incredible it's because I
literally use that one every single day
and I was obsessed with it but now this
one I was just like taking over I'm also
gonna take this around my and then I'm
going in with the true face Sun bunny
bronzer oh oh oh girl relax
this one's in the shade bunny I think I
just um but this one has true shimmery
shades and I just love the way this
looks on my face it just adds like a
nice radiant color so I'm just gonna pop
this over that last Bruns I just on my
cheekbones I'm sorry for this squeaky
chair if you can hear that sorry money
I'm over it I'm gonna forget a knee
chair and then for the blush I'm going
to take the matte blush in the shade

corally pink so I'm just gonna put this
