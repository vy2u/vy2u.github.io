my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a chit chat get ready with me so we're
just going to sit down and chill out
have a feeling this might be a long
video so I'm going to do the makeup that
I wore in my Kylie Jenner first
impression with swatches I did like a
few days ago because a lot of people
were requesting it I might like change
up the face but I want to do the same I
look I rather going crazy
anyways let's jump straight below video
I'm going to start with the ug I'm
taking my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to
prime my eyes now it's time for the eyes
so I'm going to take my morphe brushes
eyeshadow palette in 35k and the curl
that I'm going to take first is this
cool turn of brown right here I never
usually go for cool tones on my eyes
because I just much prefer like really
warm shades but sometimes you just need
to get out of your comfort zone so the
brush that I'm using is a 2 to 8 luxe
crease crease brush by so we've out on
my god economy today so I have a cyst no
noticed a sty like right here if you
guys to see that red dot and the last
thing that you're supposed to do when
you have a sty is put makeup anywhere
near it but I haven't formed a video for
like two days
so I'm just doing it I do have eyedrops
like antibacterial eyedrops I'm just
going to put those in straight after and
hopefully doesn't get worse I'm just
doing it's the team really next color
I'm taking is this warm brown right here
on this one's gonna be concentrated
directly in the crease it's a little bit
lower than the color we just put on so
this brush is a little bit smaller so it
will just apply it a bit more precisely
what is this brush a 2 to 7 basil Weaver
favourite brush round ever the next
thing I'm taking is this one right here
it's just like a really nice pearly
shimmery shade I'm just gonna pack this
all over my lid with my finger I'm going
to keep it nice and neutral on the eyes
today this is so buttery I love it
yeah now for the face I'm taking the
Bobby Brown at vitamin-enriched face
base my face is so dry lately because of
this little sty right there I haven't
been putting products like any skincare
on my face because you're not supposed
to anything your it so my face is in
completely dry from that this is going
to make it very moisturized ah it feels
so nice going on you better put my hair
up for the foundation because it's gonna
get all up in my grill then for primer
I'm going to take my NYX angel viel I
never usually use primers and I feel
like I'm gonna wash my makeup in like
two hours anyway but maybe it'll make
the foundation go on smoother or
something we'll see if you guys know of
any good primers please let me know in
the comments below because I act
literally have two primers and I never
use them Ceaser's for foundation today
I'm going to take my Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation I have this shade
54 honey I've never really liked love
this foundation too much at all it
oxidizes a lot of my skin but I just
want to try it out for the last time and
see what I actually think of it it leaks
all through my makeup cover like oil
comes out of it and stuff it's so
annoying but let's just give it a shot
shall we the color is really nice too my
fake tan I just put one-night-stands
firming tan and dark it seems and
matching very well let's blend this in
Wow this is so full coverage so recently
I would say for like the past week I've
been watching the TV series orange is
the new black and oh my god I've just
been so obsessed with it like yesterday
and the day before I literally sat in
bed for the whole day and just watch
watch like episode after episode and
like no I need to go film and I want to
just wouldn't let me I just had to watch
it I go like two episodes left and I'm
so freaking excited by the time this
video is up I'm sure I would have
watched all of it otherwise I wouldn't
have said that I'm watching it because
what people like to spoil the end of
shows for me which is the web knife but
if you guys haven't seen orange is the
new black you need to start watching on
Netflix oh my lord I've literally never
seen a foundation this full coverage in
my entire life it looks flawless like I
can't see one thing on my face I need to
seriously get rid of those be leave lit
these bags under my eyes are just so
purple I am really freaking excited for
this so I got all the shades for the
Born This Way concealer from Too Faced
I've heard so many people talk about
this and it's a lot of people's new
favorites so I'm just oh I can't wait
okay so now I need to decide what shade
I'm gonna be because there is a lot I'm
gonna take the shade light it's a really
really light but I want to highlight
under my eyes this foundation is already
creasing here and the color is looking
orange I feel like it's oxidizing
already what the hell hmm I like the
applicator on this it's like as the doe
foot applicator I think that's what it's
called I'm gonna put a generous amount
on then I'm going to start blending this
out with my Beauty Blender oh my god it
blends so nicely oh my gold over my sky
walk my life seriously you're like in
the viewfinder like what you guys can
see now this can still look so white
under this eye but in person looks
really good
what is happening to the world I'm also
going to put that on my chin and down
the center of my face to highlight that
foundation to brighten that foundation
because I'm orange now taking my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm going to
set under my eyes I seriously like this
is the only powder I use and I cannot
find anything better so if you guys are
getting annoyed but I love it
I'm also gonna set my laugh lines in
here because this foundation is making
it look so much worse than what it
bloody should be well this is baking
under my eyes I'm gonna go ahead and
fill my eyebrows in off-camera and I'll
be right back okay so now I'm gonna set
the rest of my face with the Laura
Mercier powder let me just tell you I
think this foundation is more
appropriate for a nighttime look you
don't mean because it's really thick and
it doesn't really flawless but it is
full coverage like the fullest coverage
you can go for a daytime look I probably
wouldn't wear this but I don't know up
to you guys now for the lower lash line
I'm going to take the two colors that we
put in the crease and I'm just going to
take this from inner corner to outer
corner and then with that color that we
put all over the lid right here I'm just
going to put that on my inner corners to
brighten it up just a tiny bit now I'm
just going to pop on some mascara this
one is the covergirl these supersize in
the scar it is really really good love
this stuff I usually don't wear false
lashes in a daytime but I think both
glasses the false lashes just make
everything look so much better so I'm
going to apply just a small pair just to
enhance the eyes you know how it is
still but if you want you can totally
keep the eyelashes with just mascara
if you want I'm gonna highlight my brow
bone with the shade right here then
we're done with the eye shadow oh my god
this is very pigmented looks like we'll
just have to go back and blend this out
because that's intense imagine if I just
left it like this now for lashes I'm
taking these
Curro Curro lashes they're in the style
Daisy these look so freakin pretty and
just spidery and wispy and fluffy just
how I like it time to pop this bad boy
on now it's time to do a bit of
contouring so I'm taking this Taylor
blue medium to light contour kit I've
never used this one before so I don't
know which shade will be best for me hmm
I might mix five and six together
oh that's nice I really like that
I'm also just going to take this around
my head a little bit and then also down
the side of my nose I'm going to take
number two which is a yellow banana
shade and I'm just going to put a bit
under my eyes just to highlight a little
bit because that Laura Mercier I've had
doesn't really highlight it pretty much
just sets and I like to have a bright
under eye like all of that definitely
worked I haven't done this in ages today
I'm going to use the Too Faced milk
chocolate Soleil as my bronzer so I'm
just putting this on with a morphe g22
this is an amazing duo fiber brush and
love it so much water around my forehead
as well just to warm it up a little bit
maybe a little bit down my neck because
these two colors ain't really much them
and then I'll just go back in with that
banana shade and put that through it
under my contour instead of baking this
is just like a really quick way to clean
up that line to make sure we didn't
bring the bronzer Oakland to a25 down
I'm just gonna pop on some mascara over
my falsies just because I want them a
little bit thicker these lashes are so
comfortable because it's just like a
really thinner wideband
they're still nice and long so I'm just
giving you guys a close-up of what the
lashes look like as you can see there's
still little gaps between them so you
can still see the eye shutter on my lid
I actually really freaking love these
lashes anyways back to the face I'm
taking the bomb down boy blush this is
an amazing color look at that this is
crazy I'm just going to take a really
small amount and then tap off the excess
because it looks really crazy pigmented
just put this on the apples Macchi
just for a nice flush of color the
highlighter that I'm going to use today
is the Naz in the shade albatross I
never see people use this anymore so I
thought I'm going to pull it out and see
how good it is because I completely
forget to be honest with you let's do
this oh so pretty I freaking love this
stuff it's like a really nice yellowy
reflected like a gold yellowish shade
it's so finely milled as well this brush
is freakin amazing for highlight it's
the a 23 by Anastasio Beverly Hills it's
the best toilet of russia ever used and
i always spray mac fix+
on these brushes on highlighter brushes
before i apply highlight
I'm also going to put this down my nose
on my little tip here we call that all
so I'm just putting foundation over my
lips so my lipstick color is like more
intense I kind of try to what we call it
aware today so I'm going to line my lips
with the Kylie Jenner lip liner in the
shade expose it's just a nude shade and
then for the lips I'm going to take the
lip Couture liquid lipstick by la splash
this one's in this shade innocent vixen
it is literally like the most perfect
pinky nude ever I'm just going to pop
this on the only thing I don't like
about this is the formula is super
drying on the lips
now that that's dry oh my god I'm
freaking obsessed with this color I
forgot about it completely I'm going to
take my Kylie lip gloss in the shade so
cute this is my favorite little gloss
lip what was that I'm not too sure this
is my favorite lip gloss at the
merriment gonna pop this right over oh
my god these two work perfectly so that
we have the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I definitely think this is appropriate
for daytime it's just super glam and on
the days where you want to feel extra
hot this is perfect so if you like this
video please give it a big thumbs up and
