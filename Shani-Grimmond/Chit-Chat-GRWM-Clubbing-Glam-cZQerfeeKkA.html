my channel oh my god I'm so excited to
be coming right now
so I'm going to be doing any like a chit
chat get ready with me video because I
feel like I haven't just sat down and
how to chat with you guys in a while so
I feel like we have a few things to
catch up on so I really want to do the
look that I wore on New Year's Eve I use
this glitter right here at SLU this
Herriman it's like a peachy bronzy kind
of color and I put that all over the lid
and it looks so amazing so I dedicate
this whole look to like a glittery I
like a full glam bronzy look so let's go
ahead and get started so I'm starting
off by priming my eyes with Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot my forehead is like home
so bad because I went to the beach of
the day and I've got so sunburned I've
got to put sunscreen on my face freaking
out so bad anyways just praying my
little eyelids I bought another one of
these because mine was drying up we can
love this stuff though I got my nails
done for the first time in ages I got
them quite short I wanted them to look
kind of natural but for some reason
every time I have fake nails on I just
want to rip them off they're so annoying
I've really got one off but I had a good
explanation for that one under my nail
was like a coating that was like see ya
now for the famouser morphe 3 5 0
coloured I'm going to take this
yellowish shade right here and I'm just
going to use this as a transition shade
I recently found this amazing brush as
like a crease brush to blend everything
out
so good it's the morphe 27 so I'm just
going to buff that right in and can we
talk about the fact that it is 2016 I I
honestly don't understand how time can
go so fast like 2030 is closer than 2000
I just
emploice my mind it really does so this
year I just want a hundred percent focus
on my career I want to focus on making
better quality videos because I love
making makeup tutorials videos like this
but they're so like chilled out and I
would prefer to be making like routine
videos and stuff like that where you put
a lot more a lot more effort into
editing and just like being creative and
stuff like I don't know I just want to
put more effort into my videos and stuff
because these videos I mean they're good
to watch but you only watch so many
makeup tutorials without getting bored
and stuff so expect a lot of better
quality of videos but I still will be
doing these kinds because I do love
sitting down just doing my makeup that's
kind of how I started so I hate to just
abandon that I also really want to focus
on eating a lot healthier
I honestly it's so much junk food it's
ridiculous and my metabolism is slowing
down so I'm starting to put weight on so
I'm gonna have to start going to the gym
and just think about my healthy and
taking care of my body so you guys know
I'm join in on that mission let's do
this we can do this I honestly have an
addiction to like chocolate and lawyers
and stuff like if I don't eat in like
once every few days I will like it sort
of cranky and I just get this like
really bad craving inside of me that I
just need to eat it and then when I do
eat it I feel really happy and I feel
like a new person but I do need to cut
out a lot of sugar but I'm not just
gonna completely cut it out because I
know you then I'm just going to be a
psychopath and now I'm going to take
this shade right here it kind of reminds
you of like pumpkin I'm just going to
put that more in the crease for deepen
it up a little bit so now that
Jonathan's back at work it's me and
bending hey bindi Benny thought she was
chewing up our walls don't do that
Johnny blow up and just Marines um so
yeah I've gotta get used to being alone
every day but at least it gives me a lot
more time to think
about think about and produce videos so
I'm very very excited about that so I'm
just blending this all the way from
inner corner to outer corner and then I
was going to go back and blend it out
even more I feel like after every single
step of doing eyeshadow it really helps
if you just go back into quickly a
little blend and now taking this long
chocolatey brown color I'm just going to
focus this on the outer half of my eye
and blending it into the middle of my
crease oh yeah so as I said at the
southeast video I will this look to New
Year's so for New Year's I went into the
valley and I went to a nightclub called
prohibit for your huge improve I don't
really know it was cool but my boyfriend
won not a free booth from like a radio
station which is really cool so we got
like bottle service and stuff all night
but I honestly just got so tired like by
two o'clock I went home my cousin went
to sleep but it was really fun not I
just get so tired my energy levels don't
last very long I don't know maybe it's
because I don't eat healthy but like I
need to take care of myself more so I
can go clubbing for longer
thanks again going back with a different
brush blending this out so I'm using the
zoeva 2 to 7 this is a black pretty much
exact same as the bdellium tools 776 I
love these brushes for the creases until
I make them deeper into even like
blender grease and stuff now time for
the glitter so this is the brands this
violet Voss oh yeah this is what
everyone's been using lately apparently
this is like the best eye shadow I
glitter you can get on market and when I
used it I literally fell in love with it
so I have to buy a lot more of these and
this is in the shade copper Ella and
what I use to stick it down to my eyelid
is glitter glue by Too Faced
this stuff is incredible I'm just gonna
using zoeva 2 to 6 brush and use the
glitter that
is in the lid to start off with okay
ready oh my god it's so pretty
this lasted all night as well when I
went clubbing see this is why I like to
do my eyeshadow first because we've got
a lot of fallout down there and now
taking my makeup geek easy palette I'm
taking the black shade corrupt right
here literally the most intense black
you'll ever see and this is on a makeup
geek out of the brush and that's where
I'm going to put it so just patting out
a right on the outer corner and then
cleaning up that line to make it nice
and sharp now the prime my face I'm
taking these Smashbox photo finish
primer water this is Milioti
or you'll have to buy a new one it makes
my face feel so nice I swear like every
single one eye makeup brushes is
completely dirty I'm gonna have to do
that when I finish this as well after
eight my pramana so I'm going to take my
toothpaste alone it's very foundation I
had this a while ago but it was way too
dark so I got another one this isn't a
shade of warm beige so you just want and
it did match a time so perfectly match
with my ten now oh and I found a new
fake tan that I've been obsessive I've
been putting off my tan routine because
there's just so many tans that I want to
try um but I think I've luck
narrow it down so I'm just going to buff
this into my skin
um this is a zoeva 1:04 brush usually
use my Beauty Blender but it takes like
so long oh my god you can see like the
rent let's cover that up pink and
through still so I would have to say
that the color is actually really really
good and the coverage is incredible I
have a question for you guys
it is when you work like what you do
with your laughs um or do you go to
school I feel like why someone works
kind of sense
learn about them because obviously like
what they're interested in doing so I
love to learn a bit more about you guys
so let that let that fry bit down in the
comments so I'm going on to can see
light I'm using the HD concealer by NYX
oh this is super thick I'm just gonna
fill out there's bags on the I need some
really even that out because I just have
a wet patch under my eyes yeah so a lot
of messages on Instagram and emails and
whatever saying like asking if people if
Avenue people's makeup like there for
malls and special occasions and stuff
it's so weird because I've never had a
passion for doing other people's makeup
and I haven't like practice on enough
people to be good at all these different
features and all these different eye
shapes and stuff but I did my friend
Courtney and George's makeup the other
day and it looked really good and I was
really proud of myself but I still don't
think I've ever like be interested in
doing other people's makeup I was really
scared doing it and I know what people
do my makeup black I don't really like
it because they're really picky and I
like doing like I just know what
specific things I want in specific
places and I'm just really picky with my
makeup and I feel like everyone like
that so I don't know I just don't wanna
let people down if I like did they make
it really bad that's why I don't do it
and now I'm going to set my concealer
with the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and with a wedge so this
is what Nikki's toriel's use answer I
wanna see if it works for me I also want
to try the new VR aftershave balm see if
I makeup saves on one go but old Nikki
changing the YouTube world lover the
only thing that I love about this
product is that it doesn't really
lighten the face I know right now I look
super brat but when you brush it all off
you can't really see the brightening
effect on the eye so I always like to go
in with like the Anastasi like banana
powder or something to make it really
bright under the eyes and then I feel
like you mazey use one of the other uh
Turner but this makes like the crease in
under the eyes a lot less but I feel
like it grabs into the wrinkle at the
same time so I don't know
everything art I love it but I hate it
but I love it but I'll probably use it
for the rest of my life I get really bad
laugh line so put that right there
don't want any crease in today did you
guys see um it was a Jaclyn Hills video
about all of lack the negativity online
and stuff her video about that was so
amazing that honestly like nearly cried
it was just about how people have been
like so negative on the internet lately
and help other people having been
bringing others down and up you honestly
relate to it so much because obviously
myself having like a social media it's
great to see how much hate is going
around online like modern for people
that have lack big followings or people
that have like YouTube channels it's
just everyone in general laughs it's
actually saying I'm so incredibly
excited to use this product I'm just
gonna let this like baked under my eyes
for me well I contour so I'm going to
use the Bobbi Brown foundation stick in
the shade 6.5 i watch this usually
running Laura Lee and she use this and
freaking amazing so let's see how it
goes on me I'm sorry about a cream
contouring oh you know what I'm doing
Roger if I loved it like this hey guys I
don't know if I should use like a
stippling brush or a beauty window but
what I really know I'm just going to
start with this well what we just like
one away maybe I only talked to Laura's
video to see how she actually used it oh
my god is AB trying I guess that kind of
made difference where you guys reckon
okay well I kind of suck at doing cream
contouring and I always do that so let's
move on I'm just going to dust away all
that translucent powder I love watching
YouTube videos and people do this and
like you can see all of the the paddle
like being whipped off into the wind
ready you see it there's not working oh
well that's actually soon pretty
highlighted maybe that's because I
looked it on longer than normal okay I'm
just going to set my face with Lauren
new transistor power I feel like if I
put it over the contour it just going to
defeat the whole purpose of life doing
it in the first place but yeah okay so
now quickly I'm just going to fill up my
eyebrows with the anastasia dipbrow
pomade in medium brown emerges off
camera because I honestly haven't
mastered it and it takes so long it's
just a waste of your time should be
right back okay time to these bottom
lashes firstly I'm going to take this
orangey shame that we use in the crease
to start off with just blending this
from inner corner to outer corner I can
never talk properly when I'm doing the
bottom lashline requires so much
attention and then taking this dark
chocolatey brown shade that went in the
Attic resis is also going from inner
corner to outer corner and now taking
that black eye shadow again I'm just
going to put this right on the outer
outer corner of my lower lash line just
so we can really make everything match
to the top lash line and now taking my
cover go this super sizer mascara I'm
just going to coat my top and bottom
lashes holy crap I'm so excited to put
false lashes on and love false lashes so
much I've recently just got a massive
order of Koko lashes of Lady ma
Stockholm they're amazing I know what it
is about always love my red cherry
lashes because the lash band is X -
everything on those
full lashes today I'm taking the cooker
lashes in this style Ella I want the
outer corners to look really long so I'm
going to add more mascara they have to
make a more cat-like but other than that
I love having a really thick here oh my
god finally that literally took like
half now so I was gonna put some mascara
on the outer part of the lashes because
I wanted to kind of like wing out just
because my eye shapes hooded I feel like
that suits my I checked them worst this
is a true Faced better than sex mascara
so good oh never get over this mascara
or okay girlfriend let's move on to the
contouring I've taken the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit um I don't
know it shows you is last time I used it
it look really money because all them so
I might just try and use this shade and
this one I'm just going to start super
light Oh always a way to have it with
contouring the only thing continuity
about like contouring is the more you
like a rub it your skin the more the
foundation comes off so I can like start
to see my acne scarring under this
contouring but I went to where I got my
lips on the other day at laser clinics
Australia and I got a peel because I
want all of that pigmentation to be gone
over acne scarring so and slowly on a
process to getting rid of it all but
I'll let you guys know if it like works
and stuff but I love getting facials it
just feels so nice to like refresh your
skin foot bronzer I'm taking demon
Milani baked belongings are in a shade
zero six golden oh cool that is shimmery
holy pigmented I never thought I'd
complain about something being so
pigmented but like I prefer to build
things up rather than just like like
damnit for blush I'm taking via Milani
illuminating face power in zero three oh
my god how cute is that looks like
little roses in there so I've never used
this before either so let's just start
with a light hand as I said before I
didn't really work out
hmmm so this one isn't as pigmented so
you can be a bit heavy-handed with it
but it's really pretty supernatural I
recently bought all of the other styles
your highlighters so today I'm going to
use these so Hollywood one it looks like
this it's kind of like a champagne E
pearl color and I also got the
highlighting brush it is the a 23 by
Anastasi as well I'm just going to pack
this on I love a really strong highlight
this brush is so good for highlighting
as well so soft but bendy got to it and
ripped a few hands down I'm really glad
that I got all of the colors as well to
try them out so now it's time for the
lips so this is something that I've been
doing for a little bit now and I don't
know if I've shared with you guys so I
thought it would be perfect to add in
this look this is what I wore to New
Year's as well so let's go ahead and
align my lips this is the next
retractable lip liner in a shade natural
and now going in with this liquid
lipstick from la splash it is the lip
couture and this is in a shade innocent
vixen I've been obsessed with this stuff
lately the only thing that I hate about
it it smells so bad
the color is worth it
everything easy I forgot to press record
when I put this stuff on the middle of
my lips so this is the mouth lipstick in
the shade myth and I just put it right
in the center of my lips to make kind of
like an ombre effect and then I just
blend it out just so it's like a lighter
in the middle to make my lips appear
bigger and just to add some more
dimension I feel like the eyes are
missing something so I'm going to take
the shade shimma shimma by makeup geek
and I'm just going to put this in the
inner corners to brighten up those eyes
so then we have the finished makeup look
I hope you guys liked it I decided to
like put my hair down the end this video
just like it at least try and look
presentable with my hair I get so lazy
with it but anyways if you like this
video please give it a big thumbs up
because it honestly helps me out so so
much and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for more videos and I will see
you very soon thanks
