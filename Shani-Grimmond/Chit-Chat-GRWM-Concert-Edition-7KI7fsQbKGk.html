to my channel it feels so good to be
sitting in this chair and filming a
makeup video again for you guys that
don't know I've been away the past two
weeks in Indonesia traveling I have logs
up on my channel if you guys want to see
that and I have more to come and I'm
super excited to share them with you so
I'm going to the Ryan Lewis and
Macklemore concert tonight and you guys
are just gonna come along and get ready
with me I feel like doing something it's
super glam on the eyes I kind of want to
do something a bit different because at
concerts it's like you can really go all
out and I just really love the vibes at
concerts it's going to be great so let's
go ahead and jump straight into it I'm
going to start with my eyes today so I'm
going to conceal any veins on my eyelid
I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm just gonna put a few
strokes on here
you guys know my way you guys know that
I always use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
but that is really dry and I see a lot
of people doing this to cover the veins
in prime their eyes so I thought let's
try it out and see how it goes it
definitely is a lot easier to work into
the eyelid like it's just blending out a
lack of dream why didn't I try this
earlier I'm not too sure it's covering
everything up really well so now I'm
going to set that down with some powder
because I can see it
start to crease a little bit to start
off the eyeshadow I'm taking the makeup
geek eyeshadow in the shade at Peach
Smoothie
this is literally always always about
transition shade so I'm just going to
pop that right in the crease just so the
other colors blend up into this color
this is like my murse to use eyeshadow
you can see a big dent out of it and
that's like never happened before
because I have like a million eyes
shadows the brush that I'm using is a
Mac two to four recently I found this
and I am so obsessed with this I have a
million eyes shadow blending brushes but
for some reason this one just works so
well and it's just so easy to apply a
transition shade now it's time for the
hard part I'm going to try and do kind
of a cut crease we'll see how it goes
this is the
tried to Nona eyeshadow pallete this is
so incredible the quality of the
eyeshadow in here is just on another
level this is what the palette looks
like we have a really large range of
different colors so I'm going to pick up
this shade away no I'm going to pick up
this shade right here a warm chocolate
brown and I'm going to take that on an
angled brush and put this above my
natural crease to kind of mimic a
different one so I'm just going to look
straight ahead and put this right above
where the saggy skin is coming down that
sounds so gross but yes I have saggy
skin on my eyelids
now that we've mapped the line up above
my crease we're going to go ahead and
blend that out of it so the color that
I'm taking is this one right here this
one's more of an orange shade and I'm
taking this on a fluffier dome brush I'm
just going to go ahead and blend it out
but only blend upwards oh this is gonna
be hard okay let's do this
this may be cheating but I'm going to
take some makeup remover on a q-tip and
I'm just going to run this directly
under the line where I want it to be
super sharp because I brought that line
down way too far well I think this is as
good as it's going to get so now I'm
just going to take some a two-faced
glitter glue and I'm going to lay this
over the whole space that is there I'm
just packing this on with a really small
brush and then I'm going to pick up this
shade right here and pack this all over
the lid oh my god that's pigmented
obviously because it's glitter glue
under there as well yes
so we have a few new products to share
with you guys in today's video so I'm
going to use the over absolute cover
face primer I've used this a few times
and so far I like it I've never really
been the person to notice my foundation
stay on from primer but I'm gonna I'm
gonna keep testing that theory out
because I don't really know but it feels
really nice on my face I also have a new
foundation to play around with today
this one is the L'Oreal infallible 24
hour matte and a little you can tell I
haven't done this in a while and like
stuttering my words every two seconds
but this is in the shade 2424 golden
beige I'm really surprised actually I
thought this would be like a really
really thick consistency but it looks
pretty good it's not too runny and it's
not too thick so I'm just gonna buff
this into my skin and I have a skivvy on
so I can blend it down personal skivvy
if it's not the right color
so far I really really like the
consistency it has a really nice
coverage I like the way it looks on my
skin it just looks super natural and it
doesn't feel heavy
well not natural like it does cover a
lot but it doesn't look super cakey so
now it's time to do a little bit of
chatting so the other night I went
clubbing it was like the first time I
had been clubbing and so long I
literally got back the day that I got
back from Indonesia with like hardly any
sleep but I was like I haven't been
clubbing in so long I want to go and
have a good time and oh my god I had the
opposite of the time no it was pretty
good but a few things just like they
just kept happening bad things just kept
happening so I want to tell you what
happened first thing that happened was I
was just on the dance floor having a
good time having a bit of a dance and
then I was like fixing my hair and I
looked down and there's a massive chunk
of gum in my hair like literally I don't
see how gum can get in your hair any
other way then deliberate like you're
not just going to spit gum in someone's
hair for no reason I'm pretty sure it's
just like some nuts
come across my videos and be like I
don't like this bitch that's the only
theory that I have because I don't have
beef with anyone in real life I was
really shocked from
and I literally had to go to the toilet
and just rip my fucking hair out and
then the next thing that happened was I
was going outside with my friend just to
get some fresh air and this random guy
just comes up to me and goes get the
fuck out and I was like what he's like
get the fuck out he liked showing me
like a fly and I was just like I was
just thinking what the fuck like what
have I done
I've never seen this person in my life I
didn't get the fuck out because I didn't
want to go back inside I wanted some
fresh air anyone is allowed outside and
then all these friends were coming out
to me be like oh no don't worry about
him he's just lost his phone he's in a
bad mood I'm like that doesn't give him
the right to talk to girls like shit or
anyone's in that matter like girl you're
angry go home don't have to take your
anger out on someone else I'm a moose
happen that same guy went up to my
friend took her smoke out of her hand
turned it around and sizzled it into her
skin and burnt her we were just like so
shocked like what have we done to this
poor kid literally nothing but I will
both just so confusing to the dance
floor turned around that same guy was
there I mean my family like fucking I
like moved to the side of it otherwise
he's gonna do something again so we just
made sure that he didn't see us next
minute there's a big brawl in the middle
of the dance floor and I'm like a
fetcher that's the guy and it was him
this other guy were fighting I have no
idea why and he got kicked out so that's
what you get motherfucker
dues foundation looks really really nice
while I was away in Indonesia I got so
many freckles on my forehead you can
still kind of see them but I think I
like them they're so cute on my nose as
well for concealer I'm gonna take the
Maybelline fit me in the shade 10 this
stuff is incredible I'm just going to
put this right under here to cancel out
that purple list I'm actually pretty
impressed with this I look like I've
done a cock crease like once or twice in
my life and both times they turned out
horrible so this isn't too bad I mean I
do have a lot of improving to do let me
show you so I've got a Beauty Blender
the other day I ordered it off Sephora
and what the hell color is this
I just wanted my like you're going to
but it works the same so not gonna
complain anymore
see look at that
highlight on my eyes I love this stuff
so I'm going to put this on my chin down
the center of my nose can we cover those
little freaks there because you're
looking a bit flaky and dry and also in
the middle of my brows you know the
drill honey blonde lamomam and we have a
new product to use once again this is
the original RC ma makeup no color
powder this is a lot of power in here
I've been using the laura mercier
translucent powder for quite some time
and I've gone through like a whole tub
of it so I just thought I'll get
something that's a bit cheaper and I've
heard people say that this is just as
good as Laura Mercier so let's see how
it goes it's really finely milled it
literally is white right we're going to
let that bake for a little bit and I'm
just going to trick my phone oh my god
have you guys seen the new Instagram
snapchat thing I thought Instagram
snapchat and Facebook were owned by the
same company so it doesn't make sense to
me that Instagram is trying to copy
snapchat because then all the people
from snapchat are going to go on
Instagram and not you snap to anymore
like I just don't get it I don't feel as
comfortable posting on the new Instagram
snapchat just because I always personal
looking photos on my Instagram so for me
to post like a photo of me waking up the
morning like good morning just doesn't
just doesn't feel right to me but I do
that on snapchat because I don't want to
give up I know it's just makes me feel a
bit weird okay so now it's time to set
the rest of the face I'm going to take
the max Alexia pressed powder in the
shade NC 40 and I'm just going to dab
dab dab I swear if I don't set my
foundation anything that goes over the
top is just so blotchy and it doesn't
blend properly so always do this step oh
my god I definitely feel like oh I
definitely feel like this leaves a white
cost on my face which I actually like
but it does say no color powder no I
feel like I know maybe because I put so
much on but I can definitely see a white
cluster alright I'm impressed that stuff
is actually pretty cheap as well so
let's move on to these
Brow's I recently got this Mac eyebrow
crayon I haven't done like a pencil or
crayon formula in the longest time I
literally don't even know how to apply
it like that I only really know how to
play like a pomade or a powder but you
know what I need to step out of my
comfort zone and try something a little
bit different so mmm it's really yeah
okay so I do like this product but I can
only literally do half my brows I feel
like I can't get a really shot line onto
my brows and I feel like I can't make
the edge of my brow really shops so I
can really really use it to fill in the
front instead I'm going to take the true
brunette food line by Mac as well and
just make that really hot undefined
now it's time to finish up the eyes I'm
going to take this let orangie brown
color and this is going from inner
corner to outer corner now I'm going to
take that dark brown shade and this is
going to go directly on the lower lash
line on a flat shader brush whatever the
fro basis' gold I'm just going to get
that super close that lower lash line
now time for mascara I'm taking the
benefit roller lash I'm actually nearly
out of like all of my favorite mascara
so I really need to go buy some more but
we're just going to coat our top and
bottom lashes so we can prep them for
falsies okay so now it's time to add
some false lashes so these the ones that
I'm going to put on for tonight they're
nice and long and wispy they're from
Lily lashes I will leave the style name
down below because I've already took the
box and in but I'm going to go on the
side and match them up to this style oh
they're so beautiful for bronzer I'm
gonna take the Rimmel natural bronzer on
an angled brush I've never used this one
before oh my god I have fluff in my nose
ha I'm just going to put this under my
cheekbones to carve them out a little
bit oh the colors nice you know what I'm
really angry about the fact that I don't
have a light up so I can't light my
candles next to me for a bit of a
bronzing today I'm taking the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer I'm just going to
focus it on this right side right here
and then put this all over my cheekbones
mmm
that's no luma nating as well the brush
that I'm using is the morphe and 4 0 3
it is so soft I'm just putting this
around the foreheads as well just to
warm it up a little bit I recently got
my hands on the new formulated makeup
geek blushes that this one is in the
shade a heartthrob I really need to get
myself another Z palette so I put all my
new blushes in there but I'm just going
to use a very light hand because they
have used this once before and uh whoa
so so pigmented so I'm going to start
well so I'm just going to start by
putting this on the apples of my cheeks
and then blend it back okay
for the highlighter I'm going to take my
Anastasio a23 brushes the best the best
brush for highlight ever we're just
going to spray this with some mac fix+
because I like my highlighter to be
poppin and it's a concert again I can go
intense I'm going to take the immune
child and a star to Beverly Hills glow
kit so i've swatched all of these colors
and they are incredible they're
iridescent they change colors it's just
like everything you want so I'm going to
take the shade blue I switches this one
right here and I'm going to go ahead and
apply that oh my god I swear to god this
is not blue though this is definitely
purple now I'm going to take the shade
at Lucky Clover which is this one right
here when you swatch it it's not as
purple this one's more of like a yellowy
pearly shade so I'm just gonna put this
right over the top
oh my god these are crazy good like
crazy good now I'm just going to pick up
that color and put it on my nose just
because I want my noise to be like a
little button nose and just glow I want
everything to glow I'm also going to put
this above my brows I just had a testy
that was so cute
what can I say and also on my Cupid's
bow for the lips today I'm going in with
the essence lipliner in the shade in the
nude this is incredible it's so cheap
it's so easy to apply
well I have a ring Oh foundation on my
lips that's gross okay I'm going to go
ahead and line my lips
oh my god my neighbor is banging on the
walls or not on the walls but something
in his house I just don't understand
what what a person could be banging on
inside their house every single day and
I I've been banging on my wall so they
fucking shut up but we're nearly done
let's try and get through this so I'm
gonna take my Mac lipstick in the shade
below stick all the time I literally
have like every Mac new lipstick because
I just love the formula so much it's so
comfortable on the lips I just love it
okay this is what the shade looks like
here it is a nude pink
it's an amplified lipstick so it's not
gonna like cling to the dry patches as
much as a matte one word or a the GLIP
stick let's do this girlfriend oh it
feels so moisturizing on the lips oh my
god I'm going to go in with a gloss just
to nude it down a little bit this is the
NYX gloss in the shade Madeleine well
I'm surprised I didn't get his attention
this is pretty much the same color so
that's pretty much just a waste of my
time so there we have the finished look

a lot of fun creating something a little
bit different I never usually do greens
and I really like how it turned out so
