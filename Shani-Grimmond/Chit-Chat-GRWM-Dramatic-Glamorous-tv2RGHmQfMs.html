I'm going to be doing a chit chat get
ready with me video on the look that I
had in my last video which was extremely
dramatic like gold champagne on the eyes
a pink lip it's just really pretty and a
lot of people were asking to see it so I
thought why not make a video and it's
raining outside so I just feel like
relaxing and doing like a casual video
today so that's what I'm going to do I
hope you guys like this video and let's
jump straight into it the first thing
I'm doing is starting out with my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm going to
use this to prime my eyelids I do have a
lot of new products to use as well today
so I'm really excited to share them with
you so as you can see I'm quite pale at
the moment well oh look at my eye looks
ridiculous um we probably can't tell but
usually I faked him like every day of my
life and I actually have zero tan at the
moment and I've got a natural tan the
other day for the first time in like
literally a year because I just never
get a real tan because I get moles and
stuff um what I wouldn't got a real tan
I'm loving it I think starting next week
I'm going to do I'm going to turn
outside a bit more just because
maintaining a fake tan is literally like
a baby like having a baby it's a lot of
work and then of course I'm just going
to set that soft ochre Paint Pot with a
bit of powder just so it all blends
nicely ok let's start with the eyeshadow
so I'm taking my Too Faced natural matte
palette this is extraordinary I love
this palette so pigmented and easy to
blend all the colors and there's
literally like every Mac cot in here
that you ever need except a black but I
don't use black anyway so I'm going to
be taking the shade honey butter which
is a really like warm brown color on a
sigma e35 brush and I'm just going to
pop this as my transition shade so just
above my crease just so all the other
color Abbeville just so all the other
colors blend up nicely into this one if
you guys are looking for new makeup
brushes zoeva and sigma in my opinion
are the best or the best so the reason
I'm doing my eyes first is because the
eyeshadow that were using
whether lid lab is really glittery so
it's going to fall out everywhere so I'm
going to have to clean that up and I
don't want to waste doing my concealer
and stuff and then rubbing it off so I'm
just taking this from side to side with
this brush and I am taking it quite far
out here because I am going to take a
cotton tip and clean up that line right
there so it's nice and sharp I don't
know why but I do have a feeling this
video is going to be really long I hope
you guys don't mind now I'm going to
take this shade a chocolate cookie which
is a darker and warmer shade I'm just
popping this right in the crease all the
way from outer corner to inner corner
and I'm kind of going to like create a
soft cut crease so just looking down and
windshield wiper motions and then taking
the shade honey butter again I'm just
going to blend on those harsh lines up
there so I'm just going to focus on my
eye shadow and then we'll do some more
chit-chatting when I finish because when
I'm doing my eye shadow and you'd like
100% concentration on this now for the
fun part but also the really hard part
I'm taking these Stila magnificent metal
eyes in a shade kitten oh this is really
hard in my opinion to get evenly all
over the eyelid it's kind of like a
foiled eyeshadow so there is this little
liquid here I'm just going to pop it
drop on the back of my hand and then dip
my brush into this and see how it goes
shall we begin I'm just going to pack
this all over the lid oh my god this is
difficult
someone's here I'm actually so confused
right now
the manager of this area of this house I
mean he just came over and was like oh
I've got a few complaints one complaint
that you've been having parties on a
Sunday night like Sunday nights and I'm
just like what like we literally do not
have people over especially on a Sunday
night I am so confused right now cause
Courtney and I like grandmas and like we
do not have parties here so they know
anything about this product is when you
blink it goes all the way up there so as
you can see it's I don't know what's
going on like I don't know but we'll fix
it so now taking a bit more of chocolate
cookie I'm going to pop that in my
crease again just over the top of that
glitter and it is going to come up a
little bit into the crease but whatever
okay so now I'm taking the showed
strapless right here which is like a
plummy warm color I'm popping this in my
crease with a pencil brush I'm kind of
just like patting it down
and then of course blending out the
harsh lines I feel like majority of this
look is just literally blending blending
blending blending I hate how the arm the
little like little speckles going
everywhere all I want them is on the lid
okay so now time to clean up the eye
shadow as you can see it's going out
everywhere so I always with this step
I'm taking my Garnier micellar cleansing
water on a little cotton tip and I'm
just going to wet it a little bit and
then I take it from the edge of my
eyebrow to the corner of my eye
so as you can see that looks so much
better so I just wash my face and now
it's like really red and it has issues
so let's just cover these pimples
because the it looks ridiculous I'm
going to be taking my BB plus
elimination facial cream this is like I
think it's just like a shimmering primer
I guess I don't know I'm gonna put it
all over my face and see how it goes but
it's very shimmery it's stinks and I
look like a disco ball what the hell I
guess that's all for that primer I'm
just going to take my L'Oreal true match
foundation and I'm just going to put
like three pumps on the back of my hand
and I'm just going to start putting this
into my skin
what brush is this this is the wonderful
buffer brush by zoeva I haven't use this
foundation so long because I've been
like really tan but this is a light
foundation so it's going to match
perfectly I'm actually really liking the
way that this BB cream looks will that
BB elimination stuff looks under the
foundation it's giving like a really
nice glow to the skin and this
foundation in general is amazing it just
makes your skin look really soft and
luminous and healthy oh my god I
actually cannot stop thinking about this
weekend I'm 18 so in like three days
this Saturday I'm 18 I'm oh my god so
excited I'm going clubbing and oh I've
never been so excited to do something in
my life hopefully it's good I actually
might snapchat it so if you guys want to
see my birthday feel free to add me on
snapchat up Charlie groom and that's
going to be fun but if you guys are from
Brisbane you should let me know in the
comments um what club that you like best
because I'm quite new to this I feel
like I'm going to be going out like
every weekend for a while and then I'll
probably get over it but I'll be good to
actually leave my freaking house because
there's literally nothing to do like if
you're under age there's nothing you can
do like you can go to parties and stuff
but I don't really like parties and I
actually think I might wear this makeup
for my birthday
like really glittery it keeps going up
and it's so annoying every time I blink
it like it latches onto my skin up there
oh ok so moving on to concealer I'm
going to take my Rimmel match perfection
in your shade soft beige I've got this
the other day and I've used so much of
it already so let's just use more I'm
just going to pop this under my eyes and
it sounds like a peachy undertone so
it's going to cancel out the purple
tones under the eyes oh oh my god that
literally just spouts it into my eyeball
let's go strong with the concealer today
now I'm taking my Mac prep and prime pen
any shade of light boost I'm gonna
highlight my face even more oh my god
that is a lot
oops-a-daisy oh that's a really strong
highlight so I'm putting this down in
centre of my face as well
and speaking of clubbing I was in the
frame to cut comb in the other day and
he invited me to go out with him at the
Gold Coast and I'm actually really
excited to go to the Gold Coast because
I have no idea what the clubs are like
they're like are they different to the
to Brisbane oh my god this is really
really light yeah I'm excited so if any
of you guys are from the Gold Coast I'm
sure I'll see you around in a few weeks
time to set that concealer down so I'm
taking my AC on tour Australis contour
palette and I'm just going to set my
concealer and I use a light changes
through under my eyes stays really
bright because I if I use like a normal
pattern just go back to the rest of my
face kind of color so you get my drift
I look so white right now this is
killing me so I'm going to be taking my
hello fullest by Benefit powder any
shade honey and I'm going to use this to
set the rest of my face okay so I'm
going to quickly do my eyebrows and then
I'll be right back because it literally
takes ten years and I have a feeling
this video is really long already but if
you guys want to see a our brow routine
let me know in the comments yes I'm
aware that I look like Bambi with these
black eyebrows
but I'm going to have really big lashes
and stuff so it's all going to come
together so I'm going to start by taking
honey butter and chocolate cookie so
these two right here and I'm just going
to dust this on my lower lashline and
then take your map stealer product again
I'm just going to put this on the inner
corners of my eyes so right here now
moving on to mascara I'm taking my
Maybelline the mega plush volume Express
I just picked this up the other day and
I've been loving it I definitely think
that Maybelline has like the best range
of mascaras oh my god I just thought of
something really exciting for those of
you that don't know I'm going to amplify
it's like a tour around Australia where
a bunch of youtubers go around like
choice vine and quite a friend here and
all of that world coming true I think
four cities four or is it five I'm not
too sure but I will have a link down
below that talks about it a bit more in
detail but um you can get meet-and-greet
tickets to meet all all the youtubers
that are going including me and I am it
so excited to meet you guys you have no
idea oh my god and also my bottom lash
it's darling okay so let's move on to
eyeliner I'm taking my mr. white now
eyeliner pencil crayon eyeliner in the
shade Phil and this is the brand the
bomb it's just a brown eyeliner and I'm
just going to line my waterline now time
for false lashes I'm going to take the
lash Studio ones and the lash glue that
comes with all it really smells
disgusting like it smells like worse
than poo it would but anyways moral of
that story I need to get some more
eyelash glue so I'm just going to look
down and pop that as close as I can to
my lash line I never feel like my
makeups complete without like false
lashes like if I've got the full eye
shadow going on I just think it's
necessary at least for my eye shape I
literally just spend like 15 minutes
trying to get this eyelash to stick and
I put so much glue on it and it's just
not sticking I have no idea what's going
on it
the worst eyelash glue and eyelashes
ever yeah so now to bronze up the skin
I'm taking my Rimmel London natural
bronzer waterproof bronzing powder SPF
15 that's pretty cool so I'm just going
to take this on my zoeva luxe face to
finer and I'm just going to pop this on
my cheekbones to warm the face up and
I'm also going to contour after as well
we're also taking this around my
hairline this is an extremely dramatic
look like everything is dramatic about
this look now it's a contour I'm taking
my hoola by benefit just popping a tiny
bit under the cheekbones and then on the
sides of my nose as well now for blush
I'm taking my Rimmel London in the shade
190 coral just popping this on the back
of my cheekbones and blending it forward
I feel like that blush has like a really
nice Sheen throughout it but I'm going
to add highlight anyway because I love
my highlighter I'm going to use my Mac
mineralized skinfinish in soft and
gentle because I haven't used this in so
long and I would have to say that this
is my favorite highlighter of life oh my
god see I mean come on come on so pretty
ugly darkly so last step is lips and I'm
taking my Mac lip pencil in the shade
spice this is definitely my favorite lip
pencil in my whole collection I use it
all the time so what I'm going to do is
outline my lips a little bit and make
them appear a bit bigger oh my god my
foundation is like cracking it looks
really gross
the lipstick that I'm using is the NYX
um butter lipstick in the shade no cap
that's cool I'm actually really
impressed with this lipstick it makes my
lips feel so so soft and moisturized
and at the moment they're really chapped
and dry and I think the color is like
perfect as well it goes with every
single look snow cap that's a funny name
so yeah I'm really impressed with that
um something that I'm not impressed with
is the Stila I'm in a shade kitten I
don't know what it is but it just it
transfers on top of my eyelid and then
it like melts I don't really know how to
describe it but it just doesn't just
it's not really working that well and
the eyelashes in eyelash glue are
horrible so just to give you guys a
heads up um yeah I think that's
everything that I have to say I wasn't
really talking like to chatting that
much I don't feel because I really kind
of updated you guys with everything cuz
I did a vlog other day and I don't know
I feel like you guys know everything
that's going on in my life at the moment
sir I'm getting lipstick on my teeth oh
my god oh yeah in a week's time I'm
going to Sydney for a photo shoot I'm
actually so excited
I love Sydney it's like one of my
favorite places to or hello yeah that is
old i have to say i hope you all that
sound of song waited anyways i will see
you guys very soon why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
