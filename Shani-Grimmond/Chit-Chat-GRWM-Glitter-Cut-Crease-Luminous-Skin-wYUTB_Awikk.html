my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a makeup tutorial I have accumulated so
many new items and I cannot wait to just
try them out and experiment a little bit
so all I know is I want to do a cut
crease I want to do a chitchat get ready
with me so we're just going to go with a
flow see what happens hopefully it turns
out well if you guys don't follow me on
snapchat or Instagram then you wouldn't
know that I've been sick for the past 2
or 3 weeks now so I'm really sorry about
the inconsistent uploads I woke up
feeling so much better today which I'm
really happy about so hopefully this is
the start of me getting back on track
and better yeah anyways let's go ahead
and jump straight into this video
alrighty my little chicken wings so I'm
going to start by taking some Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot all over my lid just to
get rid of those veins you guys know
this I do this in every single video my
skin must be really dry or something
because it's really like clinging to the
dry patches on my lid and it looks a bit
flaky well let's take all that the
pellet that I'm going to use today is
the tartlet in bloom Tarte palette this
has really really pretty shades and
these colors are super pigmented so I
really want to do a cut crease I'm not
too sure how to do it I've practiced a
few times and the line was like the cut
crease was really sharp so I want to try
and use like more fluffier brushes so
it's like nice and blended
I'm really hoping it's going to work out
so the first color I'm going to take is
sweetheart it's just really nice cool
tone pink shade so this is just going to
be a light transition shade I'm just
going to pop this from inner corner to
outer corner I think too dramatic so you
know what's crazy ever since I've been
sick my lips have completely deflated so
if you guys didn't know I had live
injections about five months ago now I
can't believe how fast the time is going
like it's so crazy I thought I got it
like two months ago and I was like why
my lips going down but the more you get
sick the more your body like eats the
sugar out of your lips because I was
injected with some sort of sugar product
so here goes my lips I'm pretty sure
they're back to normal but I'm going to
book in and go get them a bit bigger in
about a month so I'm really
that that I literally have one lady that
I'm going to go with for the rest of my
life I swear to god she's the only
person I trust I saw in Lauren curtis's
snapchat that she had some problems with
getting her lips done and I'm pretty
sure she had to get them taken out I
could not imagine how scary that would
be like having to go through all the
pain of getting needles in your lips and
then having to get it sucked out like
that is so unfortunate that's why you
guys really really need to look into who
you go to before you actually get them
done because that stuff can happen now
I'm going to take the shade at rebel
which is this one right here it is a lot
darker than the one we just put in so
this is going to be like the cut crease
shade I hope this works so I'm going to
hold the brush downwards and start
creating a new crease I want to go a
little bit higher than mine the next
shade I'm taking is Lieder which is a
darker richer brown so I'm going to take
that on a flat shader brush and use the
point to really get a harsh aline than
what I already have for the longest time
of making makeup tutorials on my channel
I haven't been completely happy with my
makeup skills I feel like I was just
really lacking in a lot of departments
but over the past like two months or so
I've been practicing a lot more and I
can definitely see a slight improvement
which is so motivational motivational
for me because I want to get obviously
better at makeup and I know now I just
need to practice I just I guess was lazy
with practicing and stuff but it
honestly makes such a massive difference
the more you practice now I'm just going
to take some Too Faced glitter glue and
put this all over my lid because I want
my glitter to really stick I want to use
my weight is this violet Voss yeah this
isn't the violet Voss glitter in the
shade Lilly I've never used any kind of
purple colors on my lid so I just
thought it'd be fun to play around some
different colors and I love glitter on
my eyelids so much so I'm just going to
put a bit on the back of my hand and
work that all over my lid now it's time
to pack this all over the lid
it's all pretty
now it's time to the face so I'm going
to take the Bobbi Brown vitamin and rich
face space because I love jus eat skin
I'm just going to paint this all over
next step is to prime my face so I'm
taking the NYX angel viel primer I've
heard some amazing things about this
product so I can lot wait to try it out
oh it's kind of stuck up they come out
oh oh I knew that was going to happen I
don't even think we'll need this much
but let's work a little bit into the
face and then wipe the rest on the towel
that I'm sitting on huh
I've never really had amazing
experiences experiences with primers I
know I noticed my makeup staying on like
extra long except for the Nivea men
aftershave balm but my friend Michael
was like you can't use that it makes you
like get little dots all over your face
and I had like a few drops in my face
but I don't really mind that much
because I think I'll just use the Nivea
man aftershave balm I like festivals and
kind of like places that I need my
makeup to sound with the whole day
because that does work but not just for
like everyday use anymore that primer
feels really good now it's time to play
around with some new products so I have
the iconic London brushes here I've seen
so many people rave about these and I've
seen so many people use all the other
products on Instagram so I have very
high expectations for this brand because
everyone is just obsessed with them so
I'm going to use I think this brush
right here for my foundation I'm so
excited and then I think I'll use some
other ones for like contouring and stuff
so the foundation I'm using today is the
ex1 invisi where this one is in the
shade f 200 so I'm going to leave all of
these products I'm using in the
description below if you guys are
interested in them my tan is fading so
this is your only color I think this is
the only color that will work for me
it's dress
wha-wha okay alright
oh the coverage of this foundation
though the color oh my god this is going
on so
quickly Oh first impression this is
honestly the quickest way I have ever
applied foundation usually is like a
Beautyblender or just a normal stippling
brush but this is taking less than half
of the time which is amazing let's try
and build the coverage up a little bit
now it's time for the forehead let's do
this I'm just going to put my hair up
because I know you guys are probably
getting annoyed by now because I am now
time for concealer I'm taking the bare
minerals of bare skin concealer in the
shade light so I'm just going to put
this right under my eyes to cancel out
the discoloration my purpleness under
here has been crazy lately because I've
been sick so I'm just really gonna go in
there you know now it's time to blend
blend blend now it's time to bring in my
cream contour kit this one is from
iconic London and it's called the
multi-use contouring set I am so excited
to use this I have tried the middle
shade before but that one's too light
for me so I'm gonna try this one over
here and I just really want to brighten
up this area here and down the center of
my face so I'm just taking a really
really small amount because this stuff
is very pigmented I'm just going to put
this where I want to highlight as you
can see it's already brightening up on
my eyes and I'm also taking that down
the center of my nose and in between my
brows and imagine foundation never
sticks to my nose so I think I found a
solution this stuff actually isn't
budging at all and you can see my little
friends oh my nose this is amazing haha
girl for a little bit of cream
contouring i'm taking this middle shade
right here again a very very small
amount because a small amount goes a
very very long way we're just putting
this directly under my cheekbone to add
a little bit of structure this color is
gorgeous so I love having a really glowy
complexion so that's why I'm using lots
of cream products today and I'm also
gonna take this around my forehead as
well
I feel like this just evens out the
whole like contouring look
a little bit of noise contouring I'm
going to take the same shade and I'm
just going to pick up a little bit on
the side of this brush tap it on my hand
because we don't want it to be too
intense for the nose considering I don't
even know how to nose contour but let's
try this actually looks pretty damn good
so I'm going to keep this area free
right here and I'm just going to focus
it on the bridge at the top just
slightly padding well that's easy now it
is time to try the one and only
highlighting stick by iconic in strobing
stick no it's called disturbing stick oh
my god so this is what the car looks
like right here it's a really nice
champagne color and I have heard stone
if you will talk about this I'm excited
to try this okay so I'm just going to
take a little paddle brush and put it on
my cheekbone so I'm going to have to sit
under my eyes with powder so I'm not
going to take it too far up here because
I don't really like mixing powders on
top of highlighters because it kind of
defeats the purpose so let's go straight
in oh this is my favorite part of any
makeup look just being glowy hey what's
up hello look at that look at that happy
days oh my goodness
I'm nearly out of my Laura Mercier
translucent powder this is a disaster
sorry I was a little bit left I'm going
to take a little bit of this powder and
set underneath my eyes with the clean
spot of my Beauty Blender I mean kind of
clean
time to brush all that patter away now
it's time to move on to the brow so
today I'm using the Anastasia dip brow
pomade in the shade medium brown I am so
excited because in a month I'm going to
get my eyebrows feathered tattooed again
because I think my skin is just
rejecting the ink in the arch area for
some reason I'm not too sure why but I
can't wait for them to be on fleek again
and for them to get a plop cuz what were
their Harry I never really find people
feeling that eyebrows in true fun to
watch at all so let's just make this
quick
so the brows are done now I'm going to
highlight underneath my eyebrows so I'm
taking this color here from the same
palette that we've been using and I'm
just going to put this directly under my
brow and I'm not going to bring it too
far down you keep it nice and high
fluffy my brows are now for under the
lash line I'm taking the shade
rebel which is this one right here and
I'm just going to take this from inner
corner to outer corner this is going to
really proportion the eyeshadow look and
then with a darker shade I'm just going
to put this on the outer corner to
really deepen it up so I did bring that
other shade down quite low because I
want it to be nice and smoky now I'm
going to take this gel liner by color
pop it is in the shade at crybaby it is
a beautiful violet pink and it matches
perfectly to the glitter on my lid if I
could go back I would have used this as
a base so the purple was more intense
but let's make it more intense by lining
the waterline I have very very sensitive
waterline so let's hope it doesn't make
me what off I have an even better idea
to make this more intense so I'm going
to take these zoeva graphic eyes and
this is a beautiful purple shade I'm
just going to line my waterline with
this and hopefully it's a bit more
intense just I just think well I just
think the color I just put on then is a
little bit true I know it's just not
very stand out to you know what I mean
holy chickens this is very pigmented
check it out
oh now it's time to mascara I'm taking
the Mac extended play gigablack lash
mascara this is one of my favorites I
only recently discovered this and so far
it's the best mascara I've ever you so
just coating my top and bottom lashes
now it's time to pop some lashes on
these ones are from huda beauty one of
my favorite eyelash companies they also
have other stuff as well but I haven't
tried that out but hopefully I can one
day now it's time for blush I feel like
I need to add a little bit of color to
my face
so I'm taking the Mac blush in the shade
margin it is a beautiful shimmery
bronzer pink shade I'm just going to
take a tiny bit of this and put it on
the apples of my cheeks I've never used
this shade so I'm really excited I don't
want it to be too pink just because I
have purple on my eyes so just something
subtle is that even a thing with me
subtle probably not I might just skip
the bronzer today because we do have
that contour going on down here and that
looks really nice on its own let's move
on to the lips would it be cool if I did
a purple lip you go all out today maybe
I'll do two lip options so this one is
the BH Cosmetics in the shade when I
mean whoa whoa the closest lip liner I
have it - this lipstick is the color pop
in the shade heart on the heck
this ain't purple
well I mean this looks crazy I think it
actually looks kind of cool but I am
going to give you guys a nude option as
well just because it's not very wearable
you know what I mean now it's time to go
in with the nude lips so I'm starting
with the Mac lip pencil in the shade
spice I'm just going to outline this
hopefully all the purple gets covered
then I'm taking the boxing what even is
this I got this from America nude true
nude lip foundation and then taking a
lighter shade in the middle because just
looks weird okay I have the perfect idea
on how to make my lips not look as
wrinkly I actually love the color of all
of these products together but I really
want it to be glossy and not wrinkly so
I'm taking the matte cream shine glass
in the shade
boy abate I'm so excited I got this I
love it so much so that we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it I will leave all the
products they use in the description
below if you guys are interested in
anything
overall my favorite thing would have to
be the gloss that is amazing I love the
highlight I love the contour everything
is just I think working really well for
me today which is um very unlikely
because a lot of the time I do makeup
tutorials I have to refill on them
anyways guys I hope you have an amazing
day I've missed you so so much please
give this video a thumbs up if you do
enjoy because it helps me out a lot and
I will see you in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
