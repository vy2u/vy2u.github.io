today I'm going to be doing a chit chat
get ready with me video I'm thinking of
doing a party makeup look something
that's quite dramatic but very very
simple at the same time so it's easy to
recreate so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and let's jump into it we're
starting off with that prepping my skin
I'm going to be taking the B or a a
triple action toner I'm just going to be
putting this on a little cotton pad to
get all the oils off my skin and all of
that gross stuff I'm going on a cruise
in like six days and I'm going to
vanuatu I'm so excited I can't even
comprehend how I'm feeling right now
to moisturize my skin I'm taking the
benefit total moisturizer facial cream
and this tub is so big I'm just going to
be putting like a little piece well
that's not a pea sized a little pea size
on my face I'm just going to rub it all
that in as you do and then I'll just be
popping on a little bit of eye cream I'm
just taking the benefit it's potent
I have a web session with it benefits
skin care products at the moment I don't
know why it's just really nourishing my
skin and I have a really dry skin at the
moment because it's winter in Australia
so this is doing the trick so well full
foundation today I'm taking the L'Oreal
Lumi magique in the shade of gold linen
just on a damp Beauty Blender I have
like the smallest amount of foundation
left in here so hopefully I can tap it
out I'm probably gonna get like a bruise
on the back of my hand from doing this
oh I'm just going to start patting this
into the skin I haven't used this beauty
blender in so long
I've been using the Sigma flat top
kabuki brush in my foundation um so I
did kind of miss my beautiful beauty
blender i actually lost it for like a
month and I was dying without it because
I love this and then I found it under my
bed
oh that's kind of gross but I washed it
so one thing that I hate about all of my
foundations is that they always sit in
them little laugh lines right there so
when I laugh and then I stop oh so bad I
have these lines it's
just so annoying so many of you guys
know our foundations that don't like sit
in your fine lines and please let me
know because it's just so tragic so
because the foundation is a bit yellow
and a bit too dark for my face I'm just
going to be taking a little bit of
powder that's like in a really dark
shade and I'm just going to be blending
this down my neck just saw all matches
nicely for concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me in the shade sable
sand and I'm just going to be popping
this under my eyes to highlight and also
just to cancel out that purpley color
under there I was thinking about doing
some at first impressions on some
foundations so if you guys want me to do
that just leave a comment down below of
what foundation you want me to review or
first impression review kind of thing
because I think that would be fun it's
something different and I love trying
out new foundations as well so that
would be fabulous to set under my eyes
I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte powder
just on a little setting brush from Real
Techniques and as you can see I have had
this for so long like three years or
something like that it's just lasted me
forever and now to set everything else
in place I'm taking my Hello flawless by
benefit I use this all the time it's so
crazy I think I need to start getting
some new makeup products just to switch
things off in my videos because I feel
like it's starting to get a little
repetitive because I just have so many
makeup items that I'm like completely in
love with and I can't leave them so full
bronzer and contouring I'm going to be
taking these studio Mac care blend
powder and this isn't a shade dark I'm
just going to be trying this out as a
contour it's just like it a powder but
it's in a dark shade so let's see I'm
just taking the same product on a bigger
brush just to bronze up my cheeks a bit
I don't know I just like having that
bronzy effect and especially when you're
going out clubbing or to a party or
something it's always fine to apply a
bit more than usual well I think so
anyway and for blush I'm taking the
L'Oreal blush in the shade nude brown
and I haven't used this one in ages
forget what it looks like very nice just
a very neutral blush I'm just going to
be popping this above of where I put
that bronzer so I just right on the
cheekbones on the apples of the cheeks
and blending it back to the temples and
for highlighter I'm taking the mary-lou
manizer by the balm this lasts so long
on my skin so I think this is the best
highlighter for a party because it will
last all night long
I love highlighter because when you get
photos it flashes back and you have this
gorgeous sheen on the side of your face
I just think highlighter is like one of
the best makeup items I'll also be
putting that on my Cupid's bow as well
and now moving on to my eyebrows I'm
taking the benefit Browsing palette I'm
going to start by taking the wax and I'm
just going to be popping this on my
eyebrows I feel like when I put the wax
on my eyebrows just look ten times
better so to fill them in I'm using the
Sigma e65 little angled brush I'm just
going to be putting a little bit of
powder on my brush and then tapping it
off and working from the tail of my brow
and now I'll just be setting my eyebrows
in place with the benefit gimme brow as
you can see my eyebrows are so so so so
dark at the moment but what I have like
fake eyelashes on stuff it all kind of
blends in together okay so time for
eyeshadow I'm taking the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot I'm just going to be popping
this all over my eyelids just so I have
a nice base for my eyeshadow to sit on
and for the eyeshadow I'm taking the
mineral hygienic eyes shadow in this
shade at pinks and this is it's so
stunning it has like gold reflexes and
then it has pink reflexes all mixed
together I'm just going to be popping
this all over my eyelids this color is
absolutely stunning oh my god where has
this been my whole life seriously
enter for a transition shade I'm taking
the Mac eye shadow in the shade of brown
I'm just going to be popping this in my
crease so all the colors blend out
nicely
to make blending it really easy all you
have to do is tilt your head back a
little bit and then find your little
socket line that where that crease is so
you just put your brush in there and
then move it from side to side and it
just makes the eye shadow look ten times
better if you have a really smooth
transition shade to deepen up my crease
a bit I'm taking the Coastal Scents
revealed through pellet and I'll just be
using this dark matte brown shade on a
little fluffy pencil brush I'm just
going to be working this into my crease
and that's a blender way at those harsh
lines right there I'm taking these soft
brown eyeshadow again and at a 25 by
Sigma this is just a smaller brush than
the other one that I use before so this
is easy to blend in little areas like
this to deepen up the crease even more
I'm taking a black shade from that same
Coastal Scents palette and I'm just
going to be popping that on top of the
black I mean on top of the brown sorry
and now I'm just going back and blending
all of them colors in the crease just
with that soft brown shade again it does
look so crazy at the moment I do not
suit smooth your eyes at all but I need
to do a smoky eye on my channel let's be
real for the bottom lash line I'm taking
that same gold shade and I'm just going
to be popping that from the inner corner
to the middle of my lower lash line and
then are we taking that dark brown again
just from the outer edge with my lower
lash line into the middle and then I'll
be popping a little bit of the black rat
on the outer edge of the lower lash line
and for mascara I'm taking the benefit
they're real and I'm just going to be
popping this on my lashes to separate
them and then I'll be popping some
falsies on as well so for my falsies I'm
using the Skylar lashes in voix
lash enter for my brow bone highlight
I'm using the Too Faced natural eye
palette and I'll be taking the shade
heaven right here it is actually a matte
white I don't want to use a shimmery
white shade for my brow bone highlight
today because I have so much shimmer
going on on my eyelid so I'll just pop
this under my eyebrow
and moving on to the lips I'm going to
give you guys two different lip options
so a nudey pink and then a really bright
red so I'll start with the nude and I'm
going to start by lining my lips with
the Mac lip liner in the shade and I'm
off that looks so crazy and for the
lipstick I'm taking Japanese maple by
Mac this is just a really nice nude
shade and to top that off I'm taking the
NYX extremal lip cream I'm just going to
be popping this all over my lips to add
a bit more pink to it so I'm taking the
NYX lip pencil in the shade a red-hot
just to outline my lips again for the
lipstick I'm taking the chichi love diva
in the shade red carpet red this is just
a gorgeous true red and I've used so
much of it it's crazy well and to top
that off I'm taking the lime creme lip
gloss in the shade cherry on top it is
just a gorgeous red shade with a lot of
shimmers throughout it I have a newsday
lip gloss it has shimmers in it so this
is going to be interesting this is what
the red lip looks like I like how it
turned out although I would personally
go for the pinky nude look if I was to
go out to a party or anything like that
only because red lipstick is really high
maintenance you have to keep applying it
to make sure it's you know looking at
first and sometimes it gets on my teeth
well I'm not gonna lie it always gets on
my teeth so yeah that is all for this
makeup tutorial I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did don't forget
to give it a big thumbs up because it
means so much to me I'm just checking if
I have a lipstick on my teeth no I don't
I'm all clear anyways I will see you
guys very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
