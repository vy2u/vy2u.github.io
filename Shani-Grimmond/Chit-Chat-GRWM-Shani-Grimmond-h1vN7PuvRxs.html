my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a chit chat get ready with me so I'm
thinking of doing the makeup that I had
in my Australian tribes American candy
it was like black smokey liner grey lips
and like a really flawless face so let's
go ahead and get started all right I'm
going to moisturize my face so usually I
use a simple kind of skin light
moisturizing lotion but I just realized
yesterday that they have a rich
moisturizer as well and I love to have a
really dewy finish so let's go ahead and
apply some this I've never used before
so I don't know what it looks like or
anything but the light moisturizer has
been like my Holy Grail for so many
years so if you guys are wondering that
is the moisturizer that I'm using a
daytime oh it's still really bad it
definitely is a little bit thicker than
the lot more stress about something like
to food heavy like I wouldn't use it as
night cream I really want to get my
eyebrows done like I want them to be
reshaped and everything because I'm so
sick of them like this one's fine but
this one has like a big gash out of the
bed hmm move on now I'm going to prime
my eyes with a Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
oh my god I do this in every video I
just bought a new one there's no hole in
it anymore because my other one was
drying out it lasted a really long time
anyway so I'm not complaining it's
honestly is my life I just called the
post office lady where I am you still
even I was like hey you know someone
like stole my key please don't give any
mail out because I haven't got mail for
two weeks which is really weird because
you know you guys obviously know like
how much mail I get I put on snapchat
and I haven't got it for two weeks like
that's just freaking weird so um you
know please don't give him a lot and she
cycle actually can give mail out to
whoever has your key and I was like ok
so I'm just gonna cancel that today so
if you do want to send me mail just hold
off like two days or something because
I'm setting one up here in Brisbane so
that would be able safer warning yes
okay and using the same products like a
Western this is
the ACN two are contouring and how many
kit from Australis I'm using this color
right yeah oh no discolor my bad
this one has shimmer in it that would be
nasty I'm just gonna pop this all over
my eye let you set that's so Erica are
now taking my MAC eyeshadow in the shade
it's off brand I'm using this in my
crease as a transition shade I really
want to buy this like really big palette
from Mac you know I think I was like
twelve by photos of something in it it's
really expensive like $200 or something
and I don't know it like Mac eye shadows
aren't like as good as makeup geek but I
just want to use different brands in my
video so that maybe I should get it was
trying to talk myself into it because
it's so expensive but I think I might
get it because I feel like I need to
give other brands a chance I'm just
talking like certain brands at the
moment okay so once I've blended that in
my crease by the way this is a two to
one luxe soft crease from Zoe vibes all
over my favorite brushes ever I'm just
gonna go with my morphe brush this is
also a blending one and dish is called
the MB 23 this is a bit bigger and
fluffier so I'm just gonna blend out
those edges don't want any harsh lines
oh my god oh
so speaking of morphe brushes I
literally spent five hundred and
twenty-one dollars on wealthy stuff
yesterday when I was online shopping
that is so much money I've never spent
that much money on makeup in one go in
my entire life I was just like yeah this
isn't going to be too expensive because
it always has US dollars on the website
and I just don't think of like how much
it's going to change when you go pay in
u.s. dollars I meant IU dollars ad it
went up like an extra to two hundred
dollars like y'all are doing it for my
viewers they myself so expect a big
asshole quite thin gel then taking this
shade at babyface from makeup geek I'm
just gonna put this all over my lid
Lattin it up and then taking my makeup
geek gel liner in the shade immortal I'm
gonna line my upper lash line I'm really
bad at eyeliner oh my god this stuff is
honestly so good it's really creamy and
easy to use which is the first so you
know how color pop came out with like
all these different colored gel liners
and stuff I used it yesterday and when I
was like a Langer layering it up to make
it really opaque I was using a blue it
started cracking and it was really dry
so that sucked I was really let down by
that um I know they asked super oh my
god that just got yeah I know they asked
super cheap but it kind of sucks still
that they're really dry because they are
pretty hard to use when they're dry I
really need to fix this up now now with
a black eye shower this is corrupt by
makeup geek I'm going to take like a
thicker line of rush right here and I'm
just going to go over that and smoke it
out a little bit
the reason why I do my eyeshadow first
is because I get really bad full that
when I do my eyeshadow so I'm just
taking some micellar cleansing water
literally holy grail for this step so
good so just taking a q-tip as well I'm
cleaning up that line just taking some
eye cream now this is from Charlotte
Tilbury it comes with like an eye cream
on one side and then a color corrector
on the about if I find out that you guys
haven't been moisturizing your under
eyes you're going to be in trouble it's
honestly so important oh my gosh let's
move on to the face so first of all
Smashbox photo finish primer water I
love this I love the way it makes my
face feel so a lot of people commented
on my last vlog I did only go to the
skin is clean up so much it honestly has
like I don't have any bread cats or
anything I do have a few like scars on
my face from the acne I used to have a
pretty bad in I was looking back at my
old videos and I was like so I was
trying to hear that at the time so I'm
really glad that I had cleared up and a
lot of people asking for my skincare
routine to be honest I do use new
products I don't think that's the reason
my skin is cleared up I will do a
skincare routine anyways because I am
pretty picky with that but I went on the
pill Diane it looks like this and three
or four months after using this my skin
looks like this and I'm just so happy
that I went on this pill you can't get a
generic brand which was like half of
this price this is expensive but so
worth it because my face is looking
freakin great anyway let's move on to
hand addition I went to the shop today
and bought some new stuff this is the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous I know
this is like so old but I ran out of
like my last three bottles of this I
used to be obsessed with it so let's
give it a crack I have this shade eight
five seven and eight for two so as you
can see I do have a different background
I just for
I would do something really simple but
pretty at the same time so I've just
bought some material from spotlight and
hung it up on my green screen stand do
you guys like it I think it's cute I do
have other materials as well I'm just
down there that I bought so I will
change it up a lot and I also what to
feel like just around my house as well
Boulton setup I'm taking the NARS
radiant creamy concealer this is just
gonna go in those inner corners and
where that purple is getting rid of that
and then of course just using my B blend
up to the bull end of that okay so to
even not out I'm gonna take the L'Oreal
Lumi magique highlighting pen whoa
brunch very bright I guess what I'm for
that highlight look today guys the
Mercer know anything about having like a
black eyeliner reported eyes is that why
you blink you get like this black
transferring onto your eyelid I honestly
don't know how to stop it
like the joys of having freaking hooded
eyes right then taking a banana shade
I'm going to set that concealer because
every single concealer in the world of
creases under my eyes to set the rest of
my face I'm taking the Naz translucent
in the shade crystal it sounds a lot
reflecting setting panel it looks like
this when you swatch it you can you
can't like see anything
I don't know how what this is I always
feel like I have to set my face with
powder because otherwise it like crease
is really bad but like obviously putting
powder on your face gets rid of that
shiny look which is the look that I worn
now for the eyebrows I'm taking the brow
satin by Maybelline so on one side it
has like a crayon looking thing and then
the other side has like powder inside of
it so let's just do this
oh my god this is really dark yeah so
now I'm taking the tint my brow by
Australis this is in the lightest shade
or it's in the shade of blonde sorry I
got a lot of shade than I usually use
the years I want to see if it lines up
my black powder pillars oh it does house
in you guys in holy God
oh my god Oaks Oh weed with light
eyebrows EXO ants I'm pretty sure this
stuff dries so it weren't look as
intense for mascara I'm gonna use the
covergirl at the super sizer it is
sorry freaking good just watch this so
as you can see it makes my lashes look
really like fluffy and long and
separated I really really like this
stuff I'm gonna add falsies anyway
because what does it make up look with
that full seeds so now taking this white
color pop eyeliner it's in the shade
exit I'm going to line my waterline
because I'm gonna put some black on my
lash line and I'm gonna look like a real
gothic so I want to make sure at least
my waterline is looking big and opening
this is what the difference looks like I
think it opens my eye up a tiny bench
and now taking a little bit of black
eyeshadow I'm gonna run this on my lower
lash line now taking some soft brown by
Mac again and I'm just gonna use this to
blend it out because like it will pretty
crazy right now
time for some policies because I'm
looking crazy without it sorry these I
think the clerk Oh lashes in gonna soar
these are very luck you'll see look at
this like very spot key looking very
different to what I usually do so I'm
just gonna put these on and I'll be
right back
there is definitely something in this
odds eyelash glue that stings my eyes so
bad I really like how this works but I
wish it didn't sting oh okay let's
contour the face I replaced my little
baby this is the Bobbi Brown bronzing
powder in a shade at medium to perfect
shade took onto us or I'm going to take
us on a little brush by makeup geek this
is the cheek highlight brush musical
Angela beanie love you she got these
sets like two days ago so I have to keep
a really close eye on her because she's
not her like her stitches but yeah it
was very sad going to pick her up
because she was like yeah because she
had um painkillers and stuff Oh
literally I nearly cried I'm liking that
obsessed with her I'm really cried
because she got stitches I never do this
but I'm gonna contour my nose they still
have like a little bit of purple
eyeshadow on it yeah hopefully it
doesn't go purple oh my god I don't even
know how to do this you seem like take
it down yeah
moving on to bronzer I couldn't know the
math give me some they have different
packaging now which i think is really
cute so I'm going to runs my face up
with my blush brush by Real Techniques I
love this so bronzer I'm gonna hold this
under my cheek and then runs away the
reason why I put this up against my
cheek is so I get like a harsh line
otherwise I feel like it defeats the
purpose of contrary because you put it
like all over here so as you can see
that line is harsh so I'll just dust off
whichever's on my brush and just lightly
take that over harsh line for blush I'm
going to mix the makeup geek in the
shade a secret admirer it is a beautiful
purple so let's just pop this on my
cheeks I have no idea how it's gonna
look because it's like the lips really
purple but it's actually really pretty
once you blend it into your skin so I'm
gonna add a bit of a shimmery blush on
top for Ziggler this is the models
prefer soft touch in glow one literally
my favorite blush ever so I'm just gonna
lightly this one now taking the matte
cream color base in a shade of pearl I'm
just going to put this right up here to
highlight my face
now taking at my max highlighter I'm
pretty sure this is a limited edition it
is in the shade shaft of gold which
really like gold sorry I'm gonna put
this on top I don't know if it's in me
too dark that's why I put the pearl
underneath because this is free job
as much as I love like golden
highlighters I definitely think that the
champagne like pearly colors look a lot
better like you can't really tell too
much but I do think it's pretty I'm just
gonna have to keep trying it out all
right it's time for the lip so these are
la splash I have the shade cryptic and
ergy ghoulish I don't really don't want
to use them very similar I'm gonna use
RG ghoulish
oh my god I have mail and I literally
have half lipstick what do i do okay so
the last thing that I'm going to do is
spray my face with the urban decay chill
and makeup setting spray hopefully this
makes my face Joey
oh that glow this one is the cooling and
hydrating one I do have the all nighter
one as well which is good for clothing
okay so that we have the finished makeup
look
everything is likely because I freaking
love just a basic makeup look big lashes
at bold lips well I don't really know
what to call you classify this as very
different so I feel like when I do my
chitchat videos I'm like talking so much
in the start and it's just like and then
I don't really check too much the end so
anyways I hope you guys like this video
please give it a big thumbs up if you
did and I'll see you in my next video
