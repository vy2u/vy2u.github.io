and welcome back to today's video so
it's been like 13 days since I last
posted did you guys miss me because I
missed filming so so much so today I'm
just doing a makeup look it's a chitchat
get ready with me so talking about a few
things that have been up to lately and
all that good stuff
so when I sat down when I first started
I had no idea what makeup look I was
going for but um I was actually really
inspired by this jumpsuit that I'm
wearing so I've have so I have a lot of
Pink's on the eye and then a purple in
the crease and I honestly love the way
it turned out I would have to say this
is one of my favorite makeup looks that
I've done in my whole life so I hope you
guys like this video please give it a
big thumbs up because it helps me out a
lot and let's go ahead and get started
okay guys so I'm starting with my Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation I have
been using this for the last two weeks
like a non-stop this has been my Holy
Grail this is in the shade cashew so I'm
just going to pop a little bit on the
back of my lovely hand every time I put
foundation on the back of my hand
it stains and then I have like an orange
patch because I never wipe it off
because I'm lazy I feel like my hair's
gonna pay me off a little bit anyways so
I'm using my zoeva on powder polish
brush to apply my foundation oh my god I
totally should have done my eyes first
sorry a lot of you guys that would
probably know this already but I went on
a photo shoot yesterday for a baby booth
fashion which is just a boutique that
sells a lot of online clothes kind of
like this as well I don't think they
sell this but clothes like this so
people on tumblr will like tell me about
your experience like how it was and
everything so I thought let's talk about
it um so I've got flown to Sydney if you
guys don't know I'm from Brisbane so
it's like an hour flat so I went there
by myself which is kind of scary going
by myself
and then I went to the shoot and it was
honestly so much fun like they made me
feel so comfortable I have been on a
photo shoot before with one other
boutique
and I just wasn't really comfortable I
just felt really like like really
awkward the whole time
I don't know I guess I just felt really
comfortable because it's a very family
orientated business and they're just so
so sweet and yeah we did so many outfit
changes I would say we did like a
hundred I don't know
Oh more I have no idea how many changes
we did but honestly we were taking
photos all day from like 10 o'clock to 6
o'clock at night it was a big day I have
blisters all over my feet from the heels
I'm not used to wearing heels either so
I was kind of like tripping over
everything and when I put heels on I'm
honestly a giraffe I am so tall and I
was just like this is why I don't wear
heels because I tower over everyone whoa
that is insane that it's an old tan
going really bad let's ignore that I'm
probably gonna scroll off tonight so it
doesn't look that bad oh yeah a little
fun fact about me I'm actually quite shy
in person um I'm quite shy around people
that I don't know and then when you get
to know me I'm like the craziest person
you've probably ever met I have always
kind of pushed back like opportunities
for like modeling and like interviews
and stuff because I just I'm shy and
that's just who I am and I get really
bad anxiety if I'm kind of putting an
uncomfortable situation so I was kind of
I was like really proud of myself for
going to do this modeling thing you know
being in front of a photographer and
like all these lights on you and people
like fixing your hair and stuff I just I
find it quite intimidating I guess like
all of the support that I've got from
you guys and from my family has really
just pushed me to go and do more things
like especially for my career and I just
want to thank you guys for being so
supportive I was getting so many
messages yesterday saying I'm so proud
of you for doing that because I know you
used to talk about how like scared you
get going to do things like that and
stuff so thank you so much I'm actually
really really happy I definitely want to
do more things like that in the future
it had so much fun oh I think that I
found myself a cheerleader
now this is what you call class a
freakin flower head then let's move on
to the eyes I'm taking my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot just popping this all over my
eyelids now I'm just gonna set that with
a little bit of powder and let's just
make sure that the eyeshadow doesn't
like get really tacky on the eye area
just like blends nicely do you know what
I'm saying cuz I don't know what I'm
saying
so yesterday for that modeling job I
woke up at 4:15 in the morning and got
home at 12 o clock at night so I slept
in - 12 o'clock at lunchtime today and I
am it feeling great but I do you feel
like I'm gonna sleep a lot today as well
well tonight I feel like I'm gonna sleep
in I don't even know what am I saying
I'm still tired see now moving on to
eyebrows I'm taking my lightning
lightning brow bar to go it's not
opening
it's not opening there we go there we go
so I'm just gonna be taking a little bit
of the wax and just popping this through
my brow or brows not just one that would
be interesting now just taking this
brown color right here and I'm just
gonna fill my brows in so just starting
from the tail of my brow and extending
it a bit and then working from there
I just got a message on tumblr Singh
will you become up yourself when you
become more famous and not do any like
snapchats and stuff
we love you shiny please never change oh
my god guys being well-known on YouTube
does not make you famous it just means
that people watch your videos like I
don't think anything of it um like
famous like what you're not famous not
learning youtubers and famous they're
just well known on YouTube but moral of
the story is I'm not going to change and
if I'm gonna change it's for the good
it's not gonna be in a bad way because
we all change as we grow up we mature
and I always think it's really important
to surround yourself by people that are
really down-to-earth as well I feel like
that's the best quality in a person it's
just someone that's really down-to-earth
and genuine I swear they're so hard to
find that those type of people so just
be one of them my eyebrows are so dark
at the moment but when I put fake lashes
and stuff on they weren't look as
dramatic so let's just wait until we say
shiny eyebrows the too dark
let's just wait till the makeup looks
done there probably will still be too
dark so I'm going to start with the Mac
soft brown eye shadow on a little
blending brush from zoeva and I'm just
going to pop this in my crease to add
some definition and also to be a
transition color so I'm just taking this
in at windshield wiper motions and I
really feel like doing like a color look
today so let's see what we can do
now taking the shade innocent from the
Sigma warm neutrals palette I'm just
going to be popping this one all over my
lid this is a really nice like pink
color super wearable pink too so when
I'm doing my eyeshadow this is when I'm
don't doing it chit-chatting I just go
straight to it because I have to really
concentrate so I'll get back to
chit-chatting later for now I'm just
going to be pay out alone taking the
shade optimistic which is that this one
right here on a zoeva 2 to 7 brush so
I'm just putting this in my crease
I definitely don't want to look like
I've been punched in the eye
so I'm taking this color right here on a
little pencil brush from zoeva and I'm
just putting this right in the crease
just with some definition and I'm
focusing it on the outer half
and now taking at this color again I'm
just gonna be blending those edges so
there's no harsh lines just above my
crease
and now I'm going to be highlighting my
brow burn with this color from the
chocolate bar palette so right under my
brow bone
okay so now I'm just going to quickly do
my concealer and stuff so I can go back
to my eyes for my lower lash line so I'm
using my NARS radiant creamy concealer
in the shade custard so I'm using this
to highlight under my eyes and also to
clean up that one right there so I'm
just going to start blending this in
with my Beauty Blender and this is damp
as well
and now I'm taking my AC on to our
country and highlighting kit and I'm
picking up this light color right here
to set the concealer just to make sure
it doesn't crease and to keep it
highlighted time for the lower lash line
so I'm taking the color innocent which
is what we put over all over the lid and
I'm just popping this on my lower lash
line from inner corner to add a corner
this is so pigmented it's crazy and then
I'm taking the darker color and putting
that from the outer corner to the middle
and then the darkest color right on the
outer outer edge moving on to mascara
I'm taking my benefit they're real let's
just go ahead and pop this on honey so
there's a few things that I want to talk
about over the last like a week or two
people have been messaging me on tumblr
sending me horrible hate messages
because I haven't been uploading every
like two or three days like I used to
but I'm just want to say like every
youtuber that you watch goes through
hard times where the same as you we have
feelings you know I guess you see like
the best of our lives like you see us
happy making videos and stuff and we're
not going to like document us like
crying to you when we are upset so I
guess some of you guys have an
expectation that we're always happy
always like on our a-game but that's not
true at all so over the last like week
I've just I've stepped back and I
focused on myself just to kind of clean
my head and put myself in a wrap my own
state because I haven't been in the
right mindset at all headspace whatever
you flop and call it sorry I've just
been really you know taking a step back
and just breathing and just hope you
know what I mean now I'm just taking my
Barmes car this one gives so much volume
and it's like the only one that actually
works in my court in my makeup
collection because all my others have
dried out so now I'm just gonna be
popping some at red cherry lashes on it
so I'll be right back
freaking like six o'clock in the Sun
still at story
furies right now so moving on to
eyeliner I'm just taking a black one and
lining my waterline and this never looks
cute at all
moving on to blush I'm taking my NYX
bliss NYX blush in the shade at peach
does not look peach at all it looks hot
pink let's see it looks like on the skin
cuz I completely forget hey I usually do
bronzer first this is really weird well
this is pretty so because this blush is
really focused around the pinks I'm only
gonna do a little bit of contouring so
I'm taking my Bahama Mama by the balm
and I'm just popping this under my
cheekbones
and also a little bit around the sides
of the heads the size of the heads side
of the head my bad I've only got one hit
and full highlighter today I'm taking
the mary-lou manizer by the balm
I love highlighter look how pretty it
goes like look how pretty it looks when
it shines off the light it's a pool girl
now moving on to lips I'm taking the
colour-pop lippie stick and the
colour-pop lippie pencil they're both in
the shade button so I'm gonna start with
the lippy stick just pop this all over
oh wow this looks exactly like um lime
crimes that lipstick in the shade and a
bit shirley's doing you guys in sorry
so that we have the finished makeup look
I was just playing around with different
colors and I actually really liked the
way that turned out so if you guys liked
it then please give it a big thumbs up
because honestly helps me out so so much
and yeah I hope you guys have a lovely
day and I'll speak to you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
