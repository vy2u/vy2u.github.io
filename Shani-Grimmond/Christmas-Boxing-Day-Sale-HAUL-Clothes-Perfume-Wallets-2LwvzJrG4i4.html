in today's video I'm doing a really big
haul I have a lot of close skin care
products perfumes bags and all that good
stuff
so let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing that I have here is the Vera
Wang princess perfume my friend Courtney
gave this to me so thanks Cort it smells
so good I seriously need to buy 100 of
these bottles because it smells like
heaven this is probably like my second
favorite perfume in whole entire world
the next perfume that I have is the Katy
Perry and meow perfume my dad actually
bought this for me for Christmas and
when I opened the box it was like half
empty so I got a bit of a dodgy one I
would say that it smells kind of like a
fresh daytime scent it's not something I
would usually lean towards well it is
nice to have in my collection because it
does smell just nice and fresh so thanks
data the next thing that I have is the
glam glow power mod a motor oil
facial treatment I tried this once and
it worked really really well I put it
all over my face and it actually like
pulled out all the dirt and I saw the
little dirt specks on my face which is
really disgusting knowing that all that
gross stuff is in my skin but it seems
to work really well I haven't noticed a
difference in my skin obviously because
I used it once but I do really enjoy it
it was like $80 so it was really really
expensive
I was quite hesitant about buying it but
I did and I'm liking it so far but I
will keep you guys updated shut up
have a nice day guys everyone's annoying
move I also picked up two eye creams the
first one is the Bobbi Brown eye cream
this was a really really expensive I've
wanted it for a really long time and
everyone said that it's amazing so it's
just like stuff it I'm going to pick it
up because I had no ice cream left and
it is so so good I'm like literally
obsessed with it it sinks into my skin
straightaway and I love it
the next one is the kills creamy eye
treatment with avocado again I've heard
like every single youtuber talked about
this and it's extremely extremely thick
so if you have dry under eyes like area
under your eye then this will probably
perfect for you I don't like it as much
as if Bobby Brown won but I'm still
going to use it because it's got a
baccata when it I think that's pretty
cool and it's green it looks like snot
and that's tur next thing I picked up is
this new wallet this is Lee brand
witchery and I think it's like the
perfect size I love black wallets
because they suit every outfit and yeah
I'm just completely obsessed with this
one you know what I mean you know what I
mean thanks to Chloe
thanks to Chloe I was actually like
Elaine and David Jones on the couches
charging my phone and then Chloe walks
back with this wallet and she's like
you're going to love this wall and I was
like oh it is so pretty it has the two
zippers down the side so I use the first
compartment for like all of my cards and
money and then we back one just for like
receipts and all of that junk
so this wallet is going to last me for
ages because it's just such a party I
also picked up another wall this one is
from Koo Chi it was half-price I was
like amazed will get it while it's on
sale it's just a very nice and beige
basic wallet with a gold band down there
so I'm really obsessed with this one
I feel like I'm not going to be able to
use it for like another year though
that's really cute next thing I have is
this bag this is from Koo Chi as well
you guys would probably figure out by
the end of this video that I'm
completely obsessed with that shop it is
amazing so this is just a very basic
black classy bag and I'm obsessed with
it it's gonna go with like every single
outfit and it's wow it fits perfectly
with my new black wallet so I just
thought oh beautiful
marry me I also have this little docking
station my exact got this for me for
Christmas and I was actually so excited
because I wonder one of these for like
three thousand years now this is a Sony
um if I can find any other details about
it I'll leave in the description box but
this is absolutely amazing it connects
with bluetooth and it's wireless so what
more can you ask for it's really loud
and it does the trick I literally take
it everywhere like big waiting to go to
the toilet I take it with me when I go
for a drive I take it with me Sark isn't
she oh my god yes girlfriend I also got
the lady million perfume this is my
favorite perfume of life oh my gosh guys
go buy it right now like smell I would
definitely say this is like the most
mature scent that I have it kind of
smells like something like seductive
you're welcome for the recommendation
have a nice day okay so now let's move
on to all the clothes that I have I have
a lot of clothes so let's get straight
into this trizol
so the first one is this dress right
here is just a basic white like fairness
fresh bandage dress and it goes to the
knees I'm loving with the new length
dresses and high-waisted skirts lately
totally up my alley I am in like a
transition of changing my style at the
moment and this is like exactly what I'm
going for very long classy but you know
still like sexy I'm not showing too much
skin yet what I'm saying I also picked
up another dress this one is from Koo
Chi it is another knee length dress and
it has really mass cutouts at the back
and I'm just like obsessed with this
color it's kind of like a white grey
kind of color I just feel like it's very
different and the materials like really
really good quality and I'm thinking of
wearing this on New Year's Eve so if you
guys recognize your wedding so New
Year's let me know in the comments what
do you think I should go for something a
bit more like the lime rice with sparkle
I don't know let me know in the comments
girlfriend next thing I have here is
just this basic t-shirt this is from Koo
Chi as well this is on sale for $25 I
think that's pretty good for a basic so
the back has like with little cutouts I
feel like that's really cute and unique
and I think it'd look really nice with
just some high-waisted pants and yeah
that's all I have to say about that one
the next thing that I have is just this
little boob tube from Koo Chi as well
it's a very short one so I think
perfect to wear with really long high
waisted skirts and also just
high-waisted pants it's like a really
hot day completely obsessed with this
everyone at like 100 times and I only go
to last week
so cha-ching bargain okay so I feel like
everything this video is kind of just
basics including this one this is from a
dish it's just a really nice top and
it's like a high neck and goes lower
down here and I feel like you can weigh
this with everything because black and
it's just very simple next thing I have
is a little bodysuit slash leotard
whatever you call them it's the high
neck at the front and then the back has
like a strap down there which i think is
really cute and then it's backless here
so I'm loving this the colors gorgeous
I'm loving like neutral colors lately so
this it's perfectly into my collection
hi I'm here to Griffin the next thing I
have is just another leotard this caught
my eye because it's back lift and I'm
like obsessed with backless things the
only issue that I have with backless
things are you can't wear a bra to make
your boobs look large and in charge so
if you have small boobs like me that's
probably the same issue that you're
having but other than that I think it's
gorgeous and it's going to last me into
a winter because it is long sleeve and
very very thick so I don't know if I'll
be able to wear it too much this summer
because it is so thick but what are you
going to do about it I also picked up
this top right here obviously I'm doing
like the high neck things lately this is
very unique I would say it's got like
this really weird pattern to it and I
know I just really like it and it feels
like a swimsuit so I think that's really
cool I haven't worn this yet I find it
really hard to kind of dress but I'll
figure something out the next thing that
I have are some high-waisted pants they
look like this I do believe these were
from general pants kori or Universal
store these are my absolute favorite
high-waisted pants and I wear them all
the time they just go with every single
outfit and the friggin comfortable they
fit perfectly I think I've said that but
what can you do I love them okay so the
next thing that I have is this
high-waisted skirt this is from dish I
kind of regret buying this because it's
really hard to dress because it has this
really like weird snakeskin kind of feel
to it
and it is cream so I don't really know
what kind of colors you would put with
cream okay so I also got another skirt
one is from ice it is a lot more
affordable than the other ones down
there so this was only like $15 and I
think it's very simple it goes with a
lot of things thank you
I don't even know if I should show you
guys this but I'm like I've been wearing
it every single day it's a little robe I
just think it's so cute it is from
cotton on body and I wear this to bed
and it's so cool because when you're
laying in bed you literally like slide
around because it's silk wreckin awesome
I love it
I hate when boys put photos up on
snapchat of them watching like cricket
for then watching like sports how boring
the next thing I have is that this
little bralette from Kukai I feel like
it's getting washed out that's better my
boobs don't really fit in it I need
bigger boobs to be able to fit in this
but I really like it the color is really
nice you know when you have those tops
that are like see-through and you want a
nice bra lit under it that's why I got
this one and I also got a gray one as
well I really like this color actually
this is a color of the New Year dress
but I was talking about oh my god there
is one more thing that I want to show
you and that is oh yeah this stuff as
well this from Kuk I also have a white
one but it's in the wash or white
Khloe's house or something because I
basically live there because we don't
separate oh okay
guys I forgot to film my outro so this
is me saying goodbye I also forgot to
mention that I got a Tiffany in coroner
clothes it's like the medium sized
silver one and I just bought the chain
by itself because it was cheaper that
way and yeah hey khlo hey guys um so
yeah anyways thanks so much for watching
guys if you liked it please give it a
big thumbs up and I'll see you very soon
have a very have a very good New Year's
and I love you guys yes my dog sorry
that start appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
