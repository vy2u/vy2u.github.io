my channel so in today's video I thought
it'd be fun to just sit down and play
around some make up I haven't played
around with a new makeup in a really
long time I'm super super excited so I
do have a blue eye contacts in at the
moment if you're wondering why I look a
little bit different so let's go ahead
and jump into this video if you aren't
subscribed to my channel already make
sure you subscribe let's do this time
okay so let's start with the eye brows
I'm going in with the Anastasia brow
powder duo in the shade self Brown I
haven't used this one in years I used to
love it so incredibly much so I'm
excited to see how it goes again I'm
going to go in with the darker shade at
first and just start by filling in the
tail of my brow and the first impression
after all this time is like so crazy how
not pigmented the powders are compared
to the pomades
like this is going to take a really long
time to fill in my brows how I usually
do them so about 20 minutes later I'm
finally done with the eyebrows I really
like the effect that the powder did give
it's really soft and like fluffy
feathery looking on the brows so I'm
just going to go ahead and cut my brows
out with the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
in the shade NC 25 used this product a
lot I love it to carve out the brows
because it's super thick huh it makes
the brows look ten times better honestly
and now I'm just going to prime my eyes
with that same concealer because I have
a lot of veins right here as you guys
can clearly see so makeup peak recently
just came out with some new eyes shadows
which I'm really excited to use in a
video finally so all of these colors
right here they are absolutely amazing
definitely up my alley
so I'm going to start by taking creme
Brule in my crease just to start off
this look and then we'll go ahead and
use some of these colors I'm just going
to start by buffing that into my crease
with a really fat brush if you guys see
my ten throughout this video just so you
know it's been on for at least two weeks
it's really crackly and yucky but I'm
going to wash it off tonight honestly
takes so long to wash like old hands off
because they really cling to my dry skin
now taking the new shadow in the shade
sidekick this is a beautiful warm color
I am obsessed with this I'm just going
to take that on a Mac what is this two
to four I'm just going to blend this
into my crease but I'm not going to go
as high as the other shade so just
looking down and then taking this in
windshield wiper motions these colors
honestly Berland like a dream like I've
never had an eye shadow blend so easily
in my way and then going in with a shade
at cabin fever which is another new
shade I'm just going to pack this all
over my lid this eye shadow look might
be like a little bit similar to
something I've done before but I just
sort of be fun to do like a traditional
full smoky eye taking that same shade
I'm just going to blend out the edges
this is a zoeva two to seven brush
I love zoeva brushes so much now we have
the warm Brown that smokey eye done so
let's move on to the face I'm taking the
Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow as a
primer I want the face to look really
glowy and dewy and this stuff is
gorgeous I'm just going to work this
into my skin with a stippling brush this
honestly feels so hydrating on my face
the best feeling now I'm going in with
the it cosmetics CC cream this has 50
plus sunscreen I don't really like when
foundations have sunscreen because you
get like that really bad flashback I
would prefer to just add in myself
bubbles gonna use it anyway no flash for
me I've used this before it I really
liked it considering it's a CC cream
stank's it's adding really really nice
coverage so I'm pretty much just
painting this all over my face and then
I'm going to take a Beauty Blender and
just dab this in to get rid of any lines
now I'm going in with the makeup studio
compact neutralizer in blue one so I'm
not sure if this is a concealer or just
a corrector so I'm just going to start
wearing this where I have a lot of
discoloration under my eyes it's quite
dry so it's hard to like blend yeah it's
definitely cancelling out the
discoloration and then I'm just going to
take a bit of a mac prolongwear
concealer directly under that other
corrector and just brighten this up a
little bit this combination under my
eyes is working it so well at cancelling
out that discoloration now I'm going in
with the Rimmel match perfection a
transparent powder to bake underneath my
eyes so my concealer doesn't move
throughout the day so just doing this
with a damp Beauty Blender translucent
powders so messy huh oh my god as I said
that literally half of this tub went
under the floor for the rest of my face
I'm going in with the hello flawless at
my benefit in a shade honey I don't have
any other powders really I mean I have a
few but this one's my favorite if you
guys know of any good like full coverage
kind of powders please let me know in
the comments below because like powders
are something that I don't collect like
I do with bronzers and stuff because
it's boring but I love this one
so a few days ago I went to Melbourne to
go clubbing and I went to the races it
was honestly so much fun
I love Melbourne clubbing so much like
the music is so much louder they stay
open so much later like I looked at my
phone it was 6:30 in the morning and I
was still dancing I'm like I need to go
this is ridiculous
the clubs in Brisbane close at 5:30 so
I'm just used to staying until that time
which was a ridiculous hour but it's fun
I'm just going to dust everything off
under my eyes and then I'm going in with
the shade and light palette by Kat Von D
and I'm just taking this breath this
bright yellow shade in the middle and
I'm going to use this to highlight under
there keep it nice and bright nice and
white my under eyes look really crusty I
needed some like really hydrating cream
on there oh now time for the lower lash
line I'm going in with the makeup geek
shadow in the shade at cabin-fever this
is the one that we put all over the lid
so I'm just going to dip my little
pencil brush in there and take this from
inner corner to outer corner on my lower
lash line really close to my lashes and
then I'm going to take the crease color
on a really fluffy brush and just below
this under my lower lash line I get
really smoky now it's time for the
bronzer I'm going in with this nos
products it is called
Malina it looks like this it is super
dark but I don't know I just have a
feeling it might work if I am really
like a light handed with it I'm just
gonna put this right okay just blending
it out slowly but surely there we go oh
my god
then the bronzer that I'm using today is
the wet and wild in the shade at
princess tap off the excess I'm just
going to warm up the cheeks a little bit
and also around the forehead because
this foundation is a little bit light
compared to my neck I've never used this
bronzer before but so far I actually
like it considering like how inexpensive
it is I actually really like that um
nice product as well I honestly have no
idea why I skipped the eyes but let's
move on to mascara and then go back
the face I'm taking the Too Faced better
than sex mascara I haven't used this one
in so long but this one definitely is a
favorite it makes my lashes so big and
then I'm going to coat my bottom lashes
with the covergirl super sizer mascara
this wand is a bit thinner so it's
easier to apply on the lower lashes
without getting it all over the skin now
I'm just going to add some really nice
fluffy lashes from Lily lashes and then
I'll be right back I feel like those
lashes made the whole look look 20 times
better
so moving on I'm taking the Rimmel stay
matte powder I'm just going to use this
to bake a little bit under my bronzer
because it got a little bit messy so I'm
just going to take this really flat kind
of brush and just brush this under here
get rid of any of the bronzer shade
there now going in with the Becca blush
in the shade bolero if that's how you
say it I'm just going to put this on the
apples of my cheeks and blend it back I
feel like this shade is perfect for
literally any look because it is so
neutral and just a classic color I love
it then for the highlight I'm going in
with the artist go to our luxurious
cheek color in the shade fetish it's
really shimmery so I'm assuming it is a
highlighter
I already spritz my brush with my fix+
oh my god it's literally drenched oh my
god I hate fan brushes for highlighting
I lost my good one found it this is such
a pretty like pinky peach highlighter um
I'm also going to go in with the jeffree
star skin frost in the shade ice cold
this one is very intense I just want it
to be like a bit more pale this one is a
little bit dark so I'm just gonna go
straight over the top girl anyone that
doesn't like a dramatic highlighter you
will hate this this is the most dramatic
highlighter you will ever see in your
life I'm also going to put this on the
tip of my nose and blend it out now I'm
going in with the of decay lip liner in
the shade at gache this is a really nice
dark plum II purple I love dark lips
especially for fall even though in
raelia it's not full but whatever
these lip liners are honestly so creamy
and really easy to work with I love them
and then for the lipstick I'm going in
with the urban decay in the shade shame
this is a cream formula so bloody
pigmented this is a really dark purple I
was like that I've done a darker than so
long and of course the last step is to
go in with some setting spray this is
the Gerard cosmetics slay all day this
one has alcohol in it to make your
makeup sound really long but that also
burns your eyes if it gets in there so
make sure to squeeze your eyes really
tight okay so that we have the finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it
this would be my perfect full makeup
look the only thing that I the only
thing that I don't like is how the
lipstick gets all over your teeth I
think because the formula is so creamy
and buttery but I really love the color
I'd probably just stick to liquid
lipsticks when it comes to like really
dark shades so if you liked this video
