channel my hands are white and my arms
are brown and I love it
so today I'm doing a clothing haul I
have so many new clothes to share with
you guys I have kind of changed up my
style lately and kind of getting my head
around on what I want to wear and stuff
so I'm really excited to share with you
my new style I hope you guys like this
video and let's get straight into it
okay so let's start with what I'm
wearing get this out of the way so this
first is from French Connection it's
size 8 it fits perfectly
the only thing that I don't like about
it is it is itchy around the neck the
material is super thick so it keeps me
nice and warm
it goes down past the knees and I think
it's really nicely structured it's kind
of like a business II lasering type of
vibe at the top and I'm just completely
obsessed with it you can button it up
around the waist to give yourself a bit
more of a mmm-hmmm I don't really know
what just say that this was quite
expensive but I do feel like it's worth
it just because you can wear it with so
many different things because the colors
really versatile and it's just a basic
so I thought I'd pick this up the next
thing is this leotard right here this is
from seed I when I saw this I was like I
need to get this because it's just a
basic they can go with a hundred
different things I mean my whole closets
like basic so nothing new yeah I just
really like the color I really want to
get more nudie beige kind of white beige
no I wanna get I don't know what color
beige is anyways I want to get more nude
color clothing business like the first
thing that I have that students I'm
completely obsessed with it if you guys
follow me on Instagram you would know
that I'm obsessed this because I've been
wearing it so much like over wearing it
but I don't care because I love it
girlfriend the next thing that I have
here is this white crop it is a long
sleeve one it is backless which is my
favorite thing and the best thing about
this whole thing
chass√© thing one more time mm-hmm is
you can wear a bra with it but it's
still backless because this bit here
covers the bar the covers the bra strap
and it has three buttons up here so it's
really nice and it just took this with
it it goes with so many different things
because again it is basic and it's what
it's going to match everything zel it
really is this is from butter it's
eight quality is just on point butter
was actually one of my favorite shops
the moment usually um cool K is my
favorite shop but I don't like that
stuff anymore it's really weird
so Bardo you go girl oh my god this is
my favorite thing in the whole entire
hall look it's so pretty
okay okay so it's this jumpsuit right
here it kind of reminds me of like a
business II lack professional feminine
kind of vibe it is so nice the color is
really unique I don't have anything like
this color it has like a band around the
waist so it kind of pulls you in like
and it has like a low boob thing so you
can see a bit of cleavage going on which
is my kind of thing girlfriend this is
from Topshop and it was 132 dollars and
I don't have any way to wear it so I
think I just wasted $132 well maybe I
can just take a photo in it and post it
pretend I'm going somewhere usually I
have problems with jumpsuits going to
the ground because I'm really tall but
this actually fits perfectly in a
surgical quality and hopefully I find
somewhere to wear it because it is
stunning
the next thing that I have is this black
crop this is from butter it is just a
very simple v-neck and it goes with
everything so next up we have these
black high-waisted jeans right here
these are from whitefox boutique you can
get them from so many different
boutiques boutiques because reverse is
sold at like pretty much everywhere this
is the size 10 usually I'm a size 8 but
on the sides turn these and they fit so
nicely so very impressed with these
they've run a bit of Europe's on them
it's not like completely shredded but
every time I wear ripped jeans someone's
like her few jeans are gone and I'm like
really it's not like I haven't heard
that one before I also picked up this
top right here I don't even know how to
describe it this is not something I
would usually get but when I saw it I
was like oh this looks nice immature and
comfortable so I just got it you could
wear this with high-waisted jeans leave
you pretty much way over there okay I
can't speak you could pretty much wear
it with everything it is like a nice
washed out kind of beige color I think
it's really pretty it is from witchery
and I got this from the clearance
witchery and it was like really cheap so
love you which rate I've been actually
obsessed with that shop lately I should
check it out girl
next I have this button-up white kind of
sheer dress right here this is also from
the clearance witchery I think it had
like a faulty button on it and I was
down from like $150 I was like yes yes
give it to me it is super comfortable
and what I do is just put a belt on it
so it gives me a bit more next we have
this v-neck a little sweater right here
it's kind of like a fluffy material in
the front and then a silky material in
the back so classy in the front party in
the back it is super comfortable it
shows a lot of cleavage so I do need to
get some Hollywood tape the next thing I
have is this cropped sweater this is
from UM Lulu and Rose I thought I got
this from what I swear I got this from
Topshop I don't know but this is what it
looks like right here it's so
comfortable and I love the turtleneck I
love it it keeps me so warm it's just
really comfortable so I thought I'd pick
that up for winter cause it's starting
to get really cold here in Australia
well at least in Brisbane the last thing
that I have from witchery is this
humungous oversized sweater it has a lot
of different gray and kind of white turn
throughout it this is any size extra
large I got this to wear like as a dress
but it is too short to wear as a dress
so it's just like a basically a
humungous jumper I think it's cute
though yeah it's just the size of like
five with me I also picked up at these
little night pants right here I don't
even know why because I don't work out I
mean I try like I even bought a
membership the other month and I've been
like for a week that's all that oh I
just have no motivation to here the gym
at all like I just don't know if I have
motivation in last two days it's all
mine but I think these pants are cute I
feel like if I buy new clothes for the
gym then I'll have motivation for a day
the next thing is this gym top as well
why do I do this to myself it is from
Lorna Jane it is just a fluorescent
yellow kind of vest I just wear this on
its own zip it up put my sports bra
underneath and it's super comfortable
and girl do I stand out next we have
some bikinis triangle sends me all of
their new releases which is so amazing
so I finally thought I would share them
with you because they've been doing this
for like so many years now so here are
the new releases
this is what the top looks like right
here very very pretty
all the triangle bikinis are extremely
good quality I've had mine for so long
and they're still looking good as new
this is what the bottoms look like I
have a size medium in the bottoms and a
small on the top because it is
recommended to go a size up my voice
just fell out of its hole and the next
one we have is this this is the bottom I
think it's really nicely because it's
super colorful I sound like I'm going to
explode right now but I promise I'm not
I just actually freaking love this brand
this is what the top looks like so
you've got lots of colors going on all
over the shop and these make your boobs
look large and in charge you can
actually undo this as well and you've
got like a bit of cleavage what's with
me and cleavage and we also have this
pair as well so it's the same style just
different color from the ones that I
just showed you it has the little clip
at the back so you don't have to tie it
up or anything again size small size
medium fits perfectly the next top top I
have honey I know why I got all these
tubes because I don't even very swimming
that much because my tan comes off when
I go swimming oh my god heard but I love
swimming I feel like I should be a fish
but I'm not sure I'm just gonna keep
talking this is what the top looks are
top top looks like this is from cotton
on or cotton on body it was literally
like ten dollars I was like why not it's
just a basic black swim top and I love
black so I had to get it sorry these are
the boots that I picked up these are
from windsor-smith they were so
expensive they're like 230 dollars but
I'm like this is something that you can
wear all the time like constantly and
since they're such good quality you can
wear them so many times you wear them
with every single outfit
pretty much so I was like why not I have
a size 10 and I'm usually a size 8 which
was really confusing but they're really
comfortable I think maybe I've got the
10 because they're pointed up here and
my toes squeeze in so I was like I'm
just gonna go a bigger side so my toes
don't get suffocated but it it's really
comfortable um it took me I would say
like four days to wear them in until my
blisters stopped yes I did get really
bad blisters with these but once you
wear them in there will be your best
friends just one thing before we get
into the last product today so one
message me on tumblr and with
like ever since you started dating a
boyfriend you don't seem as happy just
seem a bit boring in your videos for
starters you guys haven't seen a video
when I've been in a relationship well
this is the first one I am so happy I
don't know what this girl's talking now
I just want to put it out there because
I've never been this happy in my entire
life
and someone's like or maybe she's just
maturing a bit because she's 18 she's
growing up no I'm not maturing I'm
always gonna be at well be at heart
so don't stress weird Chinese still here
okay anyways moving on to the last thing
these are you guys are probably gonna
laugh do they look like soccer shoes I
got these mic um zooms I don't even know
I don't even know why I got them they
look cool in the bottom though I just
wanted them because they match the top
that I got down there and it was a cute
little outfit and I was going on a hike
and I was like I'm just gonna buy them
so I can get a good photo so that's what
I did
um they're very flat so I don't feel
like they have a lot of support so I
probably would recommend them but I just
really like the color of them and they
were like really cheap as well so it's
not like I just went and bought these
for no reason well I did go buy them for
no reason but since they are so cheap it
was like no biggie
we have finally finished my haul I hope
