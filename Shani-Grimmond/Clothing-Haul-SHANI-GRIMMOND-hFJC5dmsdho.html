my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a clothing haul oh my god I have so many
clothes to share with you guys the other
day I went to Sydney and I did some
damage in the shop I bought so much and
also a few things I've picked up over
the past few weeks or so I'm so excited
to share it with you so let's go ahead
and get started the first thing that I
got is this top little mooring right now
and oh my god I am so obsessed with
every shade of nude so when I see
something nude I'm like yes that's mine
this is from Koo Chi so it's basically
like a boob tube and that has a strap
around the neck and the strap is
actually connected from the back so you
don't have to just tie it around the
neck like you've got a choker on really
love this material super stretchy and
it's comfortable and it goes all the way
down to the waist down here I love it oh
my god okay the next thing that I got is
a skirt from Co Chi as well in the same
material and shade just because I
thought it'd be good for clubbing I can
wear it as a dress or otherwise I can
just wear the top with a different skirt
well let's go it with a different top
again it's just because of the color I
was at war this Sam skirt was $100 I
know the other materials like more of
like the cotton materials are $50 but I
prefer the stretchy ones because they're
a lot more comfortable and I just think
they look better because they've got a
little bit of a shiny shiny finish the
material oh my god I think I wanna wear
this this weekend and then I'm gonna put
a belt around it just so you can't see
this little band right here can i sculpt
chunky belt yes next thing that I picked
up is this nude singlet or once again
it's nude I love that it has spaghetti
strap so they're super super thin and
the material is that shiny like stretchy
material again like this one so super
comfortable this was from Ali and it was
$15 that's what I call a bargain so you
could really dress this up you can wear
like white high-waisted dress pants or
you could just wear high-waisted jeans
or anything and I just think it's going
to go with so many outfits and I love
versatile basics the next thing I am so
excited about this jumper is from
Topshop it's kind of like a boyish like
tomboy jumper but it has the gold zipper
and stuff which makes it a bit more
girly and I love that it's super thick
so it's gonna keep you really warm I
were in a video yesterday and holy crap
like sweating so much because I've got
all these lights around me so perfect
when it starts to get super cold I just
love this so much it fits perfectly
this one was 130 so pretty pricey but if
you're going to get like a nice dressy
jacket I feel like they're all going to
be expensive I went to Zara to get like
a black leather jacket and I was like
230 dollars I was like you know like
over $100 it's pushing it right oh and I
also picked up a white spaghetti straps
in that as well from Ali as I showed you
the nude one before if I see something
that I like and it comes in like
different shades I'll just grab all of
them so that's how I roll especially
when they're cheap the next thing that I
got is this vest I got this when I was
in the u.s. so I'm not too sure where
it's from I think it was called urban
outfitters we don't have that in
Australia and it's so bloody good they
had so much variety like my voice is
getting croaky anyways I love this so
much it is a cropped one and I haven't
really worn it yet only in a video by
some I'll get the courage to wear it I
mean it's different and it's out of my
comfort zone but I noticed that denim is
coming in and it looks so good when
people are rocking the denim on denim
and I also got another dinner one while
I was in like the denim vibe I just
picked up - this one is from expressed
genes that's also in the US so I'm not
too sure if you can get a hold of it in
Australia but a lot of people are
selling denim jackets so this one's
super cute again this one is cropped so
perfect for high waisted pants I only
wear high-waisted pants next thing that
I have is this long-sleeve t-shirt this
one is from Koo Chi again I was really
like drawn in by this because of the
color it's so nice it's super
comfortable and I just thought it would
be good to wear with high-waisted jeans
I always say like oh yeah this would be
good with how it's a jeans but like
everything goes with our sejoon I just
think it is super cute and it's super
thin and just comfortable and I always
tend to buy like really uncomfortable
things and I just did in my cupboard and
I never wear them so I thought I Mazal
start being realistic with my life and
getting comfortable things because
that's what I always wear oh I love this
one so much holy crow look up
okay so we have a few more things from
cooker because I'm obsessed it's cool
Mughal walnut that was probably me so I
got three of these like bralette things
so I got a size two usually my size one
but I feel like my breasts grew so I got
a bigger size so it doesn't like bulge
up around here and they fit perfectly so
it has a like sticky elastic part so it
kind of really sticks and it doesn't
fall down so there's the light one I got
the off-white and then I got this like
pumpkiny orange color which is so pretty
it's kind of like a in-between a nude
and orange alkis and then I got a black
one as well because these honestly work
with so many different outfits but yeah
I did have this one already but that was
in a size one so I just bought another
one they're super cheap I'm pretty sure
they're like $30 or something next thing
that I have is this grey sweater this
one is from H&amp;amp;M it was twenty dollars so
super cheap I've got the size small and
it kind of looks like a piece of bread
because it's square like really cool I
love it next thing that I have is a one
piece this is actually like swimmers but
I wore it as a top last week and it
looked amazing so the back is really
cool it's kind of like a backless with
all this like detailing on it
and then the front is like a really low
cut so it goes right past your nips so
if you are wearing as a top you're going
to make sure to wear like that sticky
Hollywood tape to keep your nipples in
place but this is super comfortable the
only thing that's annoying when you wear
as like a top and set of swimmers is
when every other tool could pick the
whole thing off I have a few many guys
were to see me wear these a lot but I
just want to show you anyway because
they're so stunning and it's perfect for
the weather that is coming up when it's
nothing cold but it's not too cold but
you need something really thick so these
ones are really thin pants they're from
Amara and there's a band that ties all
the way around the waist to kind of suck
you in a little bit so they're super
flowy and comfortable and I will this
with that black one piece that I just
showed you and it looks really really
good since the bottom slowly and then
the top super tight so it kind of like
proportions it out this car this color
next up I have a dress shirt this one is
from white closet I got it in Sydney I
know that brand you can get like pretty
much everywhere this is a sigh
eight and it ties up around the waist as
well to add some structure so it's a
really nice light cotton material it's
so comfortable and I can just imagine me
wearing this every time I travel because
it's super light next I have this dark
new scarf it's one of the like a massive
circle one so what you do is you twist
it and it sits up around your neck like
this it's nice and puffy the material is
nice and thin which is good because
obviously in Australia it doesn't snore
it will get overly cold - you don't
necessarily need a scarf but this is
still like a nice fashion statement I
really like it I feel like you could
make it as like a top if you just if you
worked with it now if you tie it up
around the back next we have a pair of
black high waisted pants these ones are
from chic I love them so much because
they have the little belt loops in there
so you can really dress it up and add a
belt but I wanted a pair that were
dressy and not just like plain black you
can't really see but they have like the
business see look at the front at the
top next thing that I have is this a
boob tube this is from is that what
happen accord moved remember saying that
when I was like 10 strapless top knee so
this is from Lady Luck's boutique I love
that shop so much I am size small and it
fits perfectly so it has a zipper at the
back you are a strapless bra and it
looks like big boobies all don't smush
much you got no but this is sass and
Bide inspired and it love the design of
this so you can either way like a white
have a Cisco it or a black one it
doesn't really matter I have this black
one so this one's super stretchy and it
goes past the knees super cool quality
and this is just like the most beautiful
outfit ever I picked up another t-shirt
dress kind of thing from white closet as
well so this is kind of like a knitted
material it goes up high around the neck
so the shoulders are all exposed and
then it has pockets down here so I just
looked a bit again comfortable for like
plane rides or just when I feel like
wearing comfortable clothes because as I
said before I always tend to get things
that are tight and just annoying to wear
so that's amazing and I always lean
towards grabbing that stuff out the next
thing I got from America as well but I
know you can get this anywhere it is
just a Calvin Klein crop just gray with
a white logo again super comfortable and
just chilled out I feel like this would
look good with white high-waisted jeans
and
maybe that green jacket that I showed
you before love that little bear next
thing that I have is this white crop
this one is from sports girl and I love
it because at the back it has like this
Criss crossing and then you tie it up
here so it's kind of backless but it
hides your bra strap so this works
perfectly with all of my high-waisted
everything because the size of it is
just like perfect for my torso length
because I have a super long torso so
when I wear crops they need to be kind
of long so touch my belly button because
I don't like too much of my skin showing
in crops I don't know when I said that
last time someone commented on my photo
of me wearing bikinis tag and her
boyfriend oh my god she said she doesn't
like showing your skin shut the up
smartass next thing that I have is from
Kukai as well it is like a white mesh
material shirt like long sleeve and I
bought this so I could wear a bright
bralette under it so it's kind of like a
big statement piece so far I haven't
worn it because I really don't know what
pants to wear with it I really just
don't nor what I think it's super cute
um I know I'm kind of also scared to
wear it because since it is see-through
and you have just a bralette
under it's kind of like a bit risque so
where I live I'm just like I don't feel
comfortable wearing that but you know
whatever
next thing Oh actually the last two
things are from Koo Chi as well it is
just these singlets they're nice and
tight fitting I have it's in black and
this pumpkin color as well so I love the
back of it because it's kind of like
really lower back and then it is lower
booty as well so make sure you have
Hollywood tape if you grab these because
nipples may slip out the side
if you don't I've had bronchitis for
over a week and my doctor said that I
would be coughing for a few weeks I'm
just getting so over it anyways I hope
