channel so in today's video I'm doing a
massive clothing haul I honestly have a
so many closed right next to me in a
humorous pile and I cannot wait to share
them with you so everything in this
video is from white box boutique I do
have a 15% off discount code if you guys
are interested in using that it is just
shiny if you guys want to save some
money so I've done three holes for white
fox boutique before that's how much I
frickin love them I've been shopping
with him for about five years now
obsessed
love them so let's jump straight into
the video let's start with the top that
I'm wearing right now so this one is a
nude bodysuit I love it so much it has a
neck piece that goes around here and it
is very boobylicious so if you want you
can put hollywood tape on each side so
your boobs are definitely stay in but i
haven't had any problems with them
popping out yet so i also got it in
black as well because when you like
something so much you have to get in all
colors i like this because you could
dress it up where you can dress it down
so i feel like you could wear this
clubbing or you could wear it on more of
like a casual day out or a personal
night out so yeah I really like these I
honestly feel like you wear them as
Tulku they're like that Lina hello
because I like that swimwear material
but since it is a bodysuit it has like
the things that open here so you could
be popping down there these two tops are
definitely going to be over one I can
tell you already the next thing that I
picked up is this white jumpsuit I
actually really really like this it's
different to what I usually wear I love
how it has like all of the lacy kind of
material down here as well oh my god
I've already got faked out on and I've
worn it once I'm sorry I get a size
medium and jumpsuits just because I am
so tall this one fits really really
nicely so I got this for my holiday that
I'm going to in two weeks because it's
just like super beachy and boho and it
is so comfortable this one goes around
the shoulders right here and I think
that style is really it at the moment I
honestly have so many bomber jackets but
I had to get some more because here in
Australia at nighttime it is absolutely
freezing and I'm not used to the cold at
all so I had to pick up a few this one
is just a basic black one this could
honestly go with so many different
outfits because it is black actually
print out everything in here is like a
neutral tone because it works with a lot
of things this one is the brand Rose
bullet as well so
more of the affordable brand I really
really like this one I've worn it like
20 times already here is what the second
one looks like I love the color of this
it's kind of like a cement gray toned
color this one is the brand sisters the
label so a really good brand it is a
very good quality it's super thick you
can definitely tell the difference
between the truth this one has silver
detailing on it the other one has gold
so it has it on the arms and there's
little button pockets on the side as
well I quickly want to talk about some
Sony's because like I can't wait any
longer so this is the first style that
we have here this is the brand key it is
called on the prowl so this is what they
look like they're a lot bigger than my
normal Sony's that are usually wear
that's why I want to get them because
like you know change it up a bit and I
feel like these would be amazing when
you're going to an airport since they
are so big you know when you don't wear
makeup you don't wanna look good or even
when you're hungry fight you can just
like chop these order it literally
covers half your face because they're
that big oh my god my hair just needs
some serious help to be honest the next
pair that I have also from kee they're
all from kee this one isn't a style at
Kitty so all these are quite tight on my
fat head this is what they look like
just like a classic black the black
matte cat eye and then the last pan that
I have here in this style of Vivien
these are amazing they're just like a
classic black Ray Ban looking style
Sonny these go with everything I think
my ears are a little bit crooked because
everyone else that have tried these
Sonny's on they're not preferred but on
me they are my eyebrows are just uneven
but I freaking love these ones um
these ones that Kylie Jenner I guess
made a really popular so on a lot of
sites these are sold out so I had to get
them the next thing that I picked up is
this grey dress this one goes all the
way to the knees I don't like wearing
anything that is shorter than the news
anymore so this one goes around the
shoulders like this and it is
long-sleeve I've honestly never felt a
dress that is so thick in my life so
this would be perfect for winter because
it's gonna keep me warm while I'm
clubbing it honestly is so dressy I
can't wait to wear it next up we have
these black high-waisted pants
these ones are extremely dressy they
have like this thick vent around the way
so they really suck it in because they
are quite tight I want to get these in
white as well so I'm waiting for them to
come back and stuff on the side
I used to have the white ones but my
friend like jumped on me we're in the
club and then I film a bomb and then I
got a state all of my parents it wasn't
me that was drunk it was my friend she
should be buying the new pants really
but yeah these honestly stunning they're
the wet look as well so it's a bit
different to just the average like
high-waisted jeans black high waisted
jeans or whatever so yeah it just has a
zipper at the back super stretchy super
comfy and stunning oh my god I'm so
excited about these on so these are the
bikinis that I picked up from the brand
a fox swim I just loved them because
they're very basic you could honestly
wear them a hundred times because I know
I just think they're really classic
black bikini is just the triangle with
the little stringy straps at the back
and the bottoms that they have are very
cheeky as well I also got the same in a
maroon hair because I know I'd be loving
this color lately even though it's my
school colors and reminds me of school I
literally have probably fifty pairs of
bikinis in my wardrobe but these would
have to be at one of my favorites next
up we have a sweater this one is so
comfortable it honestly feels like a
blanket like a like a throw rug that you
put over your bed it's so soft so
comfortable it has a v-neck it is a
little bit cropped but it's not too
short and the sleeves are nice and long
I think I'm going to wear this with blue
high-waisted jeans or white because it
is a very bright while it isn't off fair
I won't make you look very tan even
though in winter it's really annoying to
put tan on because it is cold I just
want to be tan so I go through the paint
anyway
I'm dedicated to that life let's all
brace ourselves this one because this is
stunning this is what it looks like here
it has like a little band around the way
so this one is a jumpsuit and then it
goes around here as well so comfortable
it's I would say more of like a summery
piece because the material is quite
light and then it also has this string
that wraps around the waist as well so
it's superb bow her I thought it'd be
perfect for my vacation in Indonesia
because I'm hoping it's going to be
really hot over there pretty sure the
last clothing item that I have is this
t-shirt dress it is so stunning I
honestly don't have anything like it so
I thought I have to pick it up I love
the color of I love the color of it it's
well it's super unique so
like a button-up I feel like it's kind
of like a silky material so it's super
shiny and because it is so boxy around
the waist I think I'm going to pair it
with like a black belt or something to
really suck it in
honestly this is so comfortable and it's
really lightweight as well last but not
least we have these amazing black
leather boots right here so I love that
it has this detailing down here one
because they can get on really easy and
I think it just adds something nice to
the boot so the heel isn't that high but
it's high enough to be able to wear
clubbing and I love how the toe comes
down to a triangle because it does make
it super dressy I wore these for the
first time last two nights ago and they
were so comfortable honestly the most
comfortable boots I've ever worn this is
a brand lipstick so that is a pretty
good red I think they will last a while
as well and I was just so shocked and
they have grip on the bottom praise the
Lord all the roots that I have in there
don't have this grip on the bottom and I
go sliding literally my life yeah I'm a
size 9 because I'm a Bigfoot and you
guys need to check these out seriously
so then we have my clothing haul I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
