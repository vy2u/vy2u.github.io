first thing you wanna do before you go
clubbing is practice your dance moves
well go bindi okay so seriously I always
eat before I go clubbing and if I don't
the next day I'm going to feel a
hangover and it's going to feel worse
than normal so I wasn't that hungry so
all I made was too toasted sandwiches
I loved the tuna and cheese toasted
sandwiches they taste so good and
they're pretty healthy as well so that's
a plus I mean it kinda looks like cat
food but we'll get through this it
tastes good uh-huh so now pouring myself
a massive glass of juice I'm obsessed
with orange juice you have no idea so
over to the table just kidding I don't
even have a dining table yet so I'm just
like walking around oh my god and then I
had a cupcake and it tasted so good I
just love cupcakes Oh
okay so now it's time to stop eating and
actually get ready I could eat all day
I've know about you guys but anyways
washing my face now with the Kiehl's
deep firming cleansing wash this stuff
is incredible I've been using it for so
long now and I'm just obsessed with it
and of course brushing my teeth because
well I did just do two now so you know
so now it's time to hydrate the skin
because we pretty much just took all of
the moisture out of it so I'm taking my
Estee Lauder hydration as the stuff is
super thick and it keeps my skin really
soft and of course taking some eye cream
and lip balm to hydrate those areas and
of course I'm applying a fake tan so I'm
just putting a moisturizer that is a
gradual tan on today just because I
already had my firming ten underneath so
I usually use the Bondi stands all the
loving 10 I'm still kind of tossing up
between the two so just putting
moisturizer on top to make sure it
doesn't go scaly like it usually does
yeah you time for makeup
I'm taking my soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac and I'm just putting this all over
my eyelids this will make sure the
eyeshadow stays on all night long and
also cancel out the discoloration on
your lids as well so now time for my
eyebrows I'm taking my anastasia brow
duo so I've been kind of doing my
eyebrows the same for the last like six
month
now I see you guys probably get the gist
of this but basically I start from the
tail I extend it and then I make my
eyebrows thicker and just sharper
unknown you get the drift
the first eyeshadow that I'm taking is
the makeup geeks creme brulee and this
is a million brand so it's perfect as a
transition shade so I'm just popping
that in my crease and blending out a lot
and then taking my zoeva rose golden
eyeshadow palette and I'm picking up the
shade just a rose it's a gorgeous gold
shade that has like a lot of pink
shimmer in it so it basically changes in
different light and then taking the
other cocoa blend palette I'm picking up
the shade substitute for love and this
is coming up more in the crease and the
other color so I'm not blending it out
as much so I'm just using a pinch
blending brush and putting that from
inner corner to outer corner and I'm
really bringing out to the edge of my
eyebrow just to elongate the shape of my
eye and then of course blending
everything out then taking the shade
freshly toasted I'm putting this right
in the socket so from inner corner to
outer corner I'm making quite a dark
line just to add more definition and
more darkness to the look then taking
the shade infusion which is a gorgeous
dark brown with gold shimmers in it I'm
just putting this on the outer socket
area so this is going to kind of make it
look a bit more smoky and a bit more
Club appropriate and of course going
back and blending it out where that
creme brulee and then of course cleaning
up that fallout so just from the outer
corner of my eye to the edge of my
eyebrow this seriously changes the I
should look very much and then to
highlight I'm taking the MAC eyeshadow
in the shade and I'll on and just
popping this right under my eyebrow to
add a bit of shimmer to the look since
it is quite matte then taking my
Smashbox photo finish primer water I'm
just spraying this all over my face and
it seriously makes my face feel so
refreshed
corefoundation I'm taking my Estee
Lauder Double Wear in the shade cashew
this is a gorgeous shade when I have a
really dark fake tan if it's a little
bit off I just blend it down my neck
like I am now and a Beauty Blender is an
incredible way to apply it it just looks
so airbrushed and flawless the
foundation has amazing coverage as well
and not to mention it lasts all night
like seriously I've slept with it on
before and it does not budge at all now
taking my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade
medium Latin neutral I'm using this to
highlight and cancel out the
discoloration on my eyes this would have
to be the best concealer I've ever use
it just has amazing coverage and the
shade is perfect
and of course blending it out with the
beauty blender this just makes
everything look seamless then taking the
AC on to our contouring and highlighting
kit and picking up the banana shade and
just popping that everywhere I put the
concealer to make sure it stays nice and
highlighted and to make sure it doesn't
crease throughout the day and then of
course setting my foundation with my Mac
powder in the shade NC 40 and then for
the eyeliner I'm using my Charlotte
Tilbury liquid liner and just lining my
lash line and then taking the balm
eyeliner in the shade at Dien I'm just
applying this on my waterline and also
on my lash line to keep it really dark
then going in with a shade of freshly
toasted I'm putting this on my lash line
so from inner corner to outer corner to
really even up the eye shadow since is
very dark on top then going in with my
Charlotte Tilbury or full-fat lashes and
my Urban Decay perversion mascara these
two work amazing together so just
putting this on my top and bottom lashes
for a lot of volume and then of course
since it's a dramatic look I'm taking my
red cherry at 43 lashes and my the lower
lash Lew and just popping that right on
top and these are just incredible and so
easy to apply
taking my Bobbi Brown bronzing powder in
the shade medium - I'm using this to
carve out my cheeks so just putting this
in the hollows of my face so under my
cheekbones my jaw bone and also around
my faith a little bit this color is
incredible for contouring so I'm also
using this to contour my nose this is
the first time I've done it and I kind
of like it
to add some wolves into the skin I'm
taking my two-faced dark chocolate
Soleil bronzing powder I'm just using
this basically in the same places that I
put that contour this adds the most
beautiful like sunkissed look to the
face so and make sure to basically put
it on my whole face and then going in
with my makeup geek blush in this shade
in saturation it's a really nice Coralie
shade and it's not too over-the-top it
pretty much goes with every single book
and then taking my essence so glow
highlighter in the shade at 10 I'm just
putting this under my powder highlight
to make it even more intense so I'm
using the back light in the shade opal
this stuff is so pigmented as you can
see I went a little bit overboard but I
love a really strong highlighter so just
applying this with a fan brush because
if you use a really compacted brush
you're going to look like a disco ball
like you probably think I look like
anyway for the lips I'm taking the
Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat in the shade
iconic nude this lip pencil is
incredible it's so easy to apply because
it's really really pigmented and creamy
and I just can't get enough of the color
so this was only the second time I'm
using it and I'd have to say it's
probably one of my favorites and then
going in with the Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick in the shade nude Kate Bob
Lewis all over my lips and then blending
it in with my lip liner and then I'm
just going in and cleaning up that lip
liner so I'm making it look a bit more
crisp with a concealer it's a few shades
lighter than my foundation and then
we'll move on to the hair so usually
when I go out I have my head down that's
just what I always do for some reason I
feel like it just makes me look a bit
more dressed up so parting my hair in
the middle spraying some dry shampoo in
because my hair is naturally pretty oily
and so annoying giving my hair a good
brush yes it was pretty muddy because I
actually would go out last night and
then going ahead and straightening my
hair
I hardly ever straighten my hair because
I don't want to die and my hair is
really kind of weak and if I strain it
too much it's just gonna get really
drying grace so there we have the hair
so this is a look that I usually go for
when I go clubbing
I love wearing two pieces or dresses
this true piece is from lady Luck's
boutique and because it was really cold
I chucked on a coat and this one is from
a white box boutique I think these two
colors work really nice
and I'm completely obsessed with it and
not to mention it's really comfortable
as well so that is everything for this
hair makeup and outfit routine video I
hope you guys loved it I'm obsessed with
how the makeup turned out especially you
definitely don't have to win this
clubbing you could work to any special
occasion because it is so fancy and
dramatic so I hope you have an amazing
day and I'll see you very soon bye ok so
just quickly I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows with the anastasia soft brown
eyebrow duo so i'm just going to do this
