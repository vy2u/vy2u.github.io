channel so in today's video I'm doing a
makeup tutorial I really wanted to do
something inspired by this photo that I
found on Instagram it's like a beautiful
sunset eye shadow look and I just sort
of look like oh that is so nice I'm
going to try my best to recreate it so
the girl that did this makeup is
definitely makeup XR on Instagram so
I'll leave her down below okay so I just
found the best eye shadow palette to
create this look sir it is the morphe
35c palette it is so colorful
I love multi eyeshadows are very
pigmented easy to work with so I feel
like this is going to be a great look so
firstly I'm going to take this black
yellow shade right here and I'm just
going to lightly dust this above my
crease so all the other colors can kind
of like blend up into that one I'm just
taking that on my Mac 2 to 4 brush it's
also where to be putting like a yellow
gown for my cruise so I'm just very
softly or lending that from side to side
oh my goddess is blending up perfectly
the next color I'm taking is this orange
right here and this is going a little
bit underneath that yellow making a
sunset doll I'm just taking this on a
smaller blending brush just because I
want that the yellow to still be peeking
through I want to go up too high so I'm
just going to go ahead and take that
yellow shade and blend out the edges of
the orange so it's all very seamless
then with that same brush I'm just going
to pick up this red color and that's
going directly in the crease so again
underneath the orange and the yellow
so again just blending in windshield
wiper motions and then for my lid color
I'm going to pick up this one right here
which is a really pretty deep violet
color oh sorry gorgeous I'm so excited
to see what this looks like on the lid
because I've never worn anything like
this before so I just have a really
small flat shader brush I'm going to
pack her on now I'm just going to take
that ready shade again and I'm going to
use this to blend out that purple just
so it's nice and soft
now it's time to move on to the skin so
I'm going to take this Sephora
luminizing booster and I'm just going to
pop this on the outside of my face so
the skin can be nice and glowy I've
never actually used it before so I don't
really know what to expect but we'll see
oh my god no but it went all through my
brow it's so watery okay I'm going to
blend it out and I really feel like that
out of too much of a glory but I guess
we'll see when the foundation goes on
top and to prime my face I'm taking
these Smashbox photo finish primer water
do you guys remember when everyone used
to use it mmm it's also refreshing on
the skin now it's time for the
foundation so I'm taking the alluri el
infallible 24 hour matte foundation I
just started using this the other day
and I was like oh my god we're seeing my
whole life it just stays on for like the
whole entire day does not budge it also
just going to put a little bit on my
brush actually a big bit and then I'm
going to blend it into my skin it has
really good coverage and I love this
color as well I'm in the shade 24 golden
beige I thought this one was in LA with
Chloe and it's just been sitting in my
cupboard this is so I was like I'm just
going to give it a try and oh my god I'm
obsessed with it I'm just going to blend
it in with my Beauty Blender because it
is quite thick there was like little
lines left on my face from a brush I'm
just gonna soak up that I'm going to do
my forehead with a little paddle brush
this way I can go around and I'm
smelling empty I literally only used it
a few times what is happening and then
put concealer I'm taking my Smashbox
Studios skin 24-hour waterproof
concealer in the shade light/medium I
used to use this all the time I loved it
so much I'm going to really highlight
underneath my eyes my face is a little
bit of a different color to my name but
we're going to make this work guys I'm
just taking the lighter shade of the
same concealer to make sure it's nice
and bright then I'm going to blend it
out with a Beauty Blender it literally
took me a whole day to sort out my
makeup room
have so much and makeover to joke I only
ever realized when I'm like going
through it otherwise I just use like the
same stuff I'm really making sure that
my under eye is fully concealed because
the colors that we have on my lid may
make the eye look like it's being
punched and Bruce so if you sure all
those orangey purpley blue tones are
gone to set that concealer down I'm
taking my a spanner loose face powder
Michael literally gave this to me like
six months ago and there was hardly
anything left but I'm still using it
like this stuff lasts so long I guess
because the container is so big I'm just
going to put a tiny bit on under my eyes
to make sure the concealer does a crease
at all and then for the rest of my face
I'm going to take this Chanel powder I
actually bought this for my $2,000
makeup tutorial and I forgot about it
but this one was like $100 so I really
want to see how it goes on my skin how
do you open this off in it here we go so
this is what the powder looks like it's
a little bit lighter than my skin tone
but we can make it work I hate how it
has like half of the packaging just a
powder puff is like seriously who uses
those anyway brushes are just so much
easier but I guess if you like going out
you can take the powder puffs in deep
space not hating okay so I'm just going
to pack this on it's making my
foundation gross
sorry patchy what the hell I literally
have no luck with powders at all I just
love my Australis one like seriously I'm
going to push my brows upwards and to do
that I'm taking the 3d brow Stearns by a
benefit I just sort of had to trim them
yesterday
oh I have hair in my mouth like what do
you mean so I'm really excited to try
this out I love putting my brows up I
feel like I look so much more natural
fluffy so up there guys oh I really like
the applicator on this separating all of
my little brow hairs so cute I'm just
starting with that a red crease color
and putting that on my lash line from
outer corner to inner corner so they can
really proportion out what's happening
on the eyes and then I'm going to take
the orange and blend that just under it
now I'm going to take this eyeliner from
colour-pop and it is in the shade booth
this is a really pretty pinky purple
type someone to the wood color so I'm
going to put this on my waterline I love
when they like two lines off so you know
you don't have to sharpen them Oh save
my life I always hate doing this part
oh so uncomfortable oh my well my face
is literally yellow and my neck is like
a brownie color we need some bronzer on
that ASAP so for my lashes I'm a tasty
benefit a roller lash and Winokur to my
top and bottom lashes so they'll be nice
and ready for my whole Seas now it's
time for the lashes I'm taking these
Empire lashes in the shade Queen of
Hearts I wore these in my last video and
all really pretty so we need to pop
these on now now for the contour I'm
taking the pixi by petra and natural
contouring powder so this one is
actually on my blog people getting so
mad at I so they're in my last video so
much but this one is very cool tones or
hopefully that works anyways back to
literally seemed like sometimes words
just really stick to you and you can't
stop saying it like that's just in my
life I'm just going to take whatever is
left down the sides of my nose I just
started doing it it looks so good it
just like eyes more shaped winery's
because it's just when I can get a bit
lost in my face sometimes and then for
the bronzer I'm taking the a Marc Jacobs
tantric or mega bronze so I need this
because like a brownie shade and I
really big brown so much you know what I
mean so I just got this new brush from
morphe it is the m5 27 their brushes are
literally so soft and love them so much
I'm just going to start by doing my
jawbone so we can blend that harsh line
and then I'm going to take some on my
cheekbones and have to do a bit of
baking actually and also around my
hairline so we can even out all this
bronze eNOS I'm just going to take a
little bit of the gold deposit on a
smaller brush just because I want to add
a little bit of
March to my cheeks I love Google og so
much I think I've said this before but
I'm pretty sure this is actually a
highlighter for deeper skin tones but I
really like it to add a glow to any
match bronzers I'm going to bake a
little bit with my ass fun powder just
underneath my contour so we can clean it
out only what I really need to get
another one of these powders that's so
good it's really soft so it doesn't make
like a super harsh line if you want to
me and then with my powder brush I'm
just gonna brush it away very lightly so
as you can see it like cleaned it up a
tiny bit but it doesn't leave any harsh
lines now for my blush I'm taking the
max lash in the shade aromas this is a
very shimmery blush I'm just going to
pop this on the apples of my cheeks and
blend it back I can honestly never have
enough shimmer on my face okay so now
it's time for the highlighter which I'm
so excited about I'm going to take the
new benefit highlighter which looks
sorry it's like a light pink fairy color
oh this is going to be good so I'm just
going to apply that with a fan brush and
it's dust it in here
it doesn't look very like chunky it just
looks very like finely milled oh yeah oh
my god that's so pretty a little bit
Lots on and I did spray my brush with
mac's fix+ I always do that with my
highlights and also I'm just going to
put that on my nose I really want to go
with like a nice pink ombre lip so we
can kind of tie in with this whole
colorful eye look it might be too much
but I'm gonna do it anyway I'm going to
start by lining my lips with the Urban
Decay lipliner in the shade at
disobedient disobedient point
firstly I want to start with the makeup
geek cream satin and I'm just going to
put this all over my lips oh my god this
stuff literally drives
sorry Matt there is no way this is ever
going to transfer so the next color I'm
going to take is a few shades lighter
and I'm just going to pop this in the
middle so we can make a little bit of an
ombre look what's new lastly I'm going
to set my face would be a touch a
luminous dewy mist or my face to be like
extra glowy so here we have the finished
of makeup look I really hope you guys
liked it oh my god I just went and did
my hair because I was like trying to
cover the color difference right here at
works really well by the way and I
noticed that this stuff left so many
dots all over my face and I'm just like
I thought this was expensive why is it
doing that
no thank you I've used this for so long
and I've never really noticed it but the
product is actually white so down the
