channel so in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a makeup tutorial on this a really
colorful look right here I think it
looks super cool I had so much fun
creating it so I have a lot of really
new products that I wanted to share with
you guys today and then I have some just
like favorite products that I chucked in
there sorry I really hope you guys like
this video I'm gonna be doing five days
of SHINee sorry for the next five days
I'll be uploading every single day so
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already so you don't miss
any videos you know what I mean okay
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video I just went ahead and prime my
eyes so let's move on to the first new
product this is the herd of Beauty
electric obsessions palette this looks
so amazing this is what it looks like
here it has so many beautiful colors in
it I really want to do a colorful look
obviously if I'm gonna use this palette
I may as well sorry the first curl that
I'm gonna take is this coral color right
here let's see if it has the name on it
I don't think so sir I'm just gonna take
a big blending brush this brush is what
is that
clémence cart Oh glam and car oh my god
it is a 2 to 8 this is the best brush
about Darner whose it is I feel like
I've always said that my videos but I
think it might be Michaels I love it so
I'm just gonna blend this in my crease
and I'm gonna bring it up nice and high
because I'm gonna put colors underneath
it so this is gonna be the top color
closer to the eyebrow so once I blend
that in windshield wiper motions I then
like to go a little circular motions
above that okay Wow my first impression
is this formula is incredible this just
blended out so well it would have to be
one of the best neon colors I've ever
used because usually they get really
like patchy and stuff but this is
incredible wouldn't expect anything less
from here to beauty to be honest I just
had a V so I'm really feeling like buzz
right now
that's so bad she oh my god with a clean
brush I'm just gonna blend out those
edges so it is nice and soft up yeah
the next color I'm gonna take is this
beautiful purple color right here that
is honestly beautiful I'm gonna take
that on a little blending brush and I'm
just gonna pack this in the outer half
of my crease and then on the inner half
I'm gonna do a different color
that's pretty I'm really gonna pack on
this color as well make it really
intense the next color I'm taking is
this beautiful hot pink right here it's
very similar to the purple so I feel
like it's gonna be really easy to blend
the two together so I'm taking a new
brush and we're just gonna pack that on
the inner corner in the crease
now I'm gonna go ahead and cut the
crease with a flat shader brush
oh my go ahead she knows let's go and
I'm gonna bring it up nice and high so
my lid looks a bit big up I'm just gonna
pack a lot on the middle and then look
up so we don't get any creasing
beautiful I'm in any transferring
once I have the outline I'm just gonna
pack it all over the lid
the next color I'm taking is this
beautiful yellow color right here I'm
gonna pack that all over where I put
that concealer so this is gonna take
time because I want to be so opaque like
very pigmented oh wow
it is so beautiful really buttery - all
right now that that's looking a hot mess
I'm gonna go end up with my makeup wipe
and clean up everything underneath it
this is gonna be really satisfying I'll
call that paint stains every paint
stains oh it's fine okay so next I'm
gonna go in with this blue color right
here and I'm gonna put that on the inner
corner of my cut crease I just feel like
it's looking really playing because that
purple out here disappeared because I
did the yellow in that like whole area
so I just so much I take a bit of this
blue to add a bit more of color a bit
more of they walk off oh my god okay you
can't pack the true colors on top of
each other so I'm gonna spray fix this
so it actually has something to stick
onto oh that's pretty
this is time to click a peacock then
with a clean brush with a little bit of
blur I'm just gonna dust over these two
colors here so we can kind of blend them
into each other I feel like we need a
little bit of like a green in between
the blue and yellow so I'm gonna go with
this shade right here it's from makeup
geek in the shade Dragonfly so I'm gonna
take that same brush that I used to
apply the Yeller and I'm just gonna kind
of like blend them all together
next thing I'm taking is the decay heavy
metal glitter liner this one's in the
shade gamma-ray this is like a really
pretty blue I'm just gonna next thing
I'm taking is the Urban Decay heavy
metal heavy metal glitter liner in the
shade at Midnight Cowboy so this one's
the gold one I'm just gonna do this on
the rest of the cup crease because I
want the gold to blend in with the blue
so I'm gonna kind of go over the top as
well the next new product is eyelashes
and multi finally came out with false
lashes these ones are in the style
luxurious this is what they look like
here they are very long and he looks
super fluffy so I'm really excited to
see how these like stick on the eye and
everything I'm hoping they're amazing
because I mean they look amazing okay
first impression I'm actually really
confused because they literally look
flat like what the hell they don't like
curl up oh my god I hate that I'm not
using those okay sir instead I'm just
gonna stick on my Holy Grail lashes this
is gonna turning into products that I
just love I mean like wait they're just
gonna stick that as close as I can to my
lash line the next product that I'm
taking is e a Bobbi Brown extra bag glow
illuminating a moisture bomb so I'm
gonna put this I think I'm just gonna
use this instead of primer actually
because I mean like why not I'm just
gonna put this on the back of my hands
Oh
yeah we carry and I'm gonna blend this
in with a brush because I literally have
glitter all over my hands oh this was
like tea tree oil that feels so nice on
the skin it's making my skin like feel
like cold next up I'm going in with the
new Naz natural radiant long wear
foundation I have the full size in like
three shades but I don't think that my
shade so I'm just using the little
samples and I have the shade Barcelona
medium for and a vanuatu medium 3.5 so
I'm just gonna see what color suits me
best okay wow that's really nice that
one's Barcelona that's what I use in my
stick foundation it's beautiful oh let's
try the other shade this one's a little
bit lighter I think I'm gonna use the
shade 3.5 they're very similar so
doesn't really matter but I'm just gonna
pull this all over my face and then I'm
gonna blend that in with my Beauty
Blender oh that colors really nice I
love how this is looking
I find if my sponge literally just
sucked up so much of that product
it's a liquidy oh yes covering all there
is bad ways I really have a few active
pimples on my face which is amazing and
the rest are just like scars left over
it should go away soon so far I'm really
loving this foundation I feel like it
may be one of my favorites like I know
I'm jumping the gun a bit I've still
gotta see like how it lost on the skin
and like if it goes oily or whatever but
I just love the finish of it it's so
natural and radiant it's just beautiful
it still looks like skin doesn't look
cakey blends out so beautifully now
going in with the concealer I'm taking
this one from colour-pop it is the nerve
filter concealer I use this in my last
video and I freaking loved it so I'm
gonna
again the color is amazing as well this
one's in the shade medium 30 I'm just
gonna blend it out with my Beauty
Blender as per you just has such good
coverage it's insane oh my god that is
sorry bird like what the hell then going
in with my Too Faced Born This Way
setting powder I'm just gonna bake
underneath my eyes with this the only
thing I don't like about it is that you
have to pump this lid off to actually
get the product in the lid but it's fine
I'm just the next product I'm taking is
the Mac Studio Fix powder this one's in
the shade NC a 42 oh wow
must be a foundation powder can't even
remember that when I got there I think
I've got a numerical all right time for
the lower lash line I'm gonna go in with
this a really nice dark green blue
emerald shade wouldn't say emerald but
it's like a navy blue under really cute
so I'm just gonna put this on my lower
lash line all the way from the outer
corner to the middle and then I'm going
in with the purple on the inner corner
to the middle and then of course going
in with a scar on my lower lashes to
even out the big lashes on the top next
up we are going to bronze the face so
this one is from BH Cosmetics it is the
21 color eyeshadow highlight and contour
palette so this is what it looks like
here and then it folds out with all the
eyeshadows but I'm just gonna use this
contour shade right here that's in the
shade maca Oh
oh that's sorry daddy looking no no okay
I really don't like that color it's not
for me Earl
wow that is so intense okay so next I'm
going to take the BH Cosmetics Saturn
bronzer in the shade ten quilt and I did
have this one in a shade tropical and it
was like my all-time favorite bronzer
but I lost it some house and we have to
order it online but I feel like this
one's gonna be really good as well this
one's just a little bit lighter sorry
I'm gonna bronze my face with this my
cheekbones all around my hairline I
absolutely love the formula of these
bronzes they're sorry buttery I'm also
gonna blend it down my neck as well on
my jaw line you know how it is
oh my gosh I'm so excited for New Year's
Eve oh I don't know where to gar though
because I feel like everywhere is gonna
be sort of packs and I totally forgot to
book a berry which is sorry shape
because base is so much fun cuz you
don't have to like line up and to
get a drink now it's time for the blush
I'm gonna take this one from Tom Ford in
the shade inhibition no this one has
really beautiful packaging oh my
goodness I'm just gonna put this on the
apples of my cheeks I'm gonna put quite
a lot on because I don't know I just
feel like there's so much pink on the
eyes why not add it on the cheeks tree
to tie it all together I love this so
much it's like such a good everyday
shade like a blush it will literally go
with every single makeup look that you
do I'm just so excited to add a
highlight next up I'm gonna go in with
the Adela brow sculpting gel and I'm
just gonna brush my eyebrows up because
it makes it up here makes it breaths
appear a lot thicker
I can never skip this step I was just
like considering skipping it cuz I
couldn't be really getting up and
getting this so lazy and I was like no
not happening
no it's time for the highlight I'm so
excited this one this is from Becca and
it
in the shade vanilla courts this is what
it looks like yah this might be a little
bit too light for me sorry we'll just
see how it goes but let's see it's not I
don't know it's weird cuz Becca
highlights I feel like a really they're
quite intense but they're sort of finely
milled that they're not like overly
shimmery it's cut I'm just like a glow
on the cheeks which is really pretty
sometimes and then other times I like to
go crazy see that's definitely to life
for me but it is still really beautiful
if you have a lot of skin than me I feel
like this would be stunning instead I'm
gonna go in with the Kat Von D metal
crush palette and I'm gonna take this
color right here it's like a coral a
pinky highlight it looks very shimmery
so completely different to what we just
put on yeah so it has like more chunks
in it it's good for like really crazy
looks but I wouldn't use any of these
shades for like an everyday look wow
what ties in really nicely with the pink
on the eyes too bad but not my favorite
not gonna lie now it's time for the lips
I'm taking this makeup forever liquid
lipstick in the shade 1:05 this is a
really pretty dusty pink color oh my god
it's really me see oh I really don't
like that color it's like purple it's
like a movi color I don't like that well
alright hopefully this one works I'm
just going to take that needs to be
fixed I'm just gonna take it this
colour-pop ultra matte little in the
shade Times Square hopefully this is
better that's
I honestly think colour-pop have some of
the best formulated liquid lipsticks
it's so it's just so comfortable to wear
on the lips it's really messy and thick
it feels really moisturizing but it's
not like uncomfortable at all I love it
I guess I'm gonna go fix my hair and
stuff and then I'll be right back
my hair is straightened now I feel like
I look a lot better I realized that the
lip color really doesn't match the eyes
when I went out in the natural lighting
sir I'm gonna take more of like a light
pink kind of color
this one's from Milani it is the amore
matte lip cream in the shade 10 adorable
I absolutely love this stuff and it's so
affordable okay so here we have the
finish to makeup look I think it looks
really cool definitely not something I
would wear on an everyday basis what is
that yeah I think it was fun like it was
fun to experiment and stuff so I hope
you guys like this video I definitely
don't think I found any like
groundbreaking products actually nert I
take the back I really didn't like the
contour products but everything else I
really really liked so yeah I hope you
guys have an amazing amazing day and I
will see you in tomorrow's video because
I'm gonna be uploading every day love
you
