little bit more of a different video
compared to my usual beauty videos I'm
going to be doing a tag and it's called
their common white girl tag and it's
just basically me answering 20 different
questions so you guys can get to know me
a bit more so let's get started
my favorite drink from Starbucks would
have to be me frappuccinos also known as
frappes and I really love the caramel
the caramel and hazelnut and just the
plain vanilla they're so delicious
despite the fact that they're like $7
for like a little cup this big but so
worth it they're just amazing
well it just depends on where I'm going
just sales going on to the grocery store
it will literally take me like two
seconds to walk out that door because I
don't care what it look like in places
like that but if I was going to like a
party or shopping or something it'll
probably take me like an hour and a half
to get ready like if I wanted to do my
makeup nicely and if I'm in a rush
before I'm going out to something like
that my makeup and my outfit would just
be a disaster
well I don't take selfies everyday but
when I do take them I probably take like
50 photos at a time just to get the
perfect photo so yeah a bit guilty on
that one
I have 85 purse online Instagram and
Marsden are actually just selfies so I
surf that balls you guys but if you want
to follow me just shiny grummond and I
have 17,000 followers and I'm so
thankful of them I honestly don't even
know where that came from
well I never usually say oMG out loud I
only say that when I'm texting and I
honestly say all the time and I'm
texting but I never say lol I just say
lull out loud but I'm trying to be
sarcastic or if I'm just trying to piss
someone off
I absolutely do wear the same clothing
item more than once especially if it's
like a pair of denim pants or like just
a plain black top I'll wear it like as
many times as I want but if it's like a
dress that's bright and you can tell
that you've been wearing it like all the
time I'll probably only wear it like
five times and just buy a new one so
that's why I always like to do some
bargain shopping and like I usually like
to spend under like seventy dollars if
I'm going to buy piece of clothing
because of that reason before we move on
to the next question I just want to say
that my mom is honestly my favorite
person in the entire world she just
brought me some chocolates and they're
my favorite and some macadamia natural
oil and I wanted this for so long so I'm
just saying I knew this video would has
something to do with something beauty
related putting my next question
I don't have Twitter anymore I guess I
do because I never deleted it but I
don't know how many tweets I've got I
probably have like 1000 tweets a Justin
we please follow me Cody Simpson I love
you because I know Cody Simpson followed
me and I was so excited but yeah I just
don't go on it I think it's so boring
and I'm just going to stick to my
Instagram and Facebook and Tumblr that's
with them so much
I would have to say that tumblr is my
favorite site out of all three of them
only because I have the most amazing
followers ever they're so supportive and
so kind and yeah I just love tumblr in
general and I also love Instagram but I
have to say that tumblr is the winner
here
I literally spend like most of my time
just on YouTube I just watch video after
video and I have learned so much on this
site I honestly love it so much and I
also just like like to go on Tumblr and
Instagram and I spend a lot of time
shopping as well so that's my favorite
things to do hence why I do them the
majority of the time
I love Schoeneck so Lauren Beauty Khloe
Morello charissa Tricia Kinsley I'm like
obsessed with everyone I love you too so
much
well it really depends if I'm like going
out or something like if I was going out
to a special event I'd make sure my
nails are nice like I have them on right
now because I did something special like
last week or something yeah sometimes I
get really lazy and I just don't even
worry about them for like two months and
I'm like well girl I need to fix these
nails yeah so I don't really care I just
do them like every two weeks it's not me
I'd say
I would have to say that I am definitely
a Shopaholic I honestly shops so much is
kind of ridiculous and being 16 all I
should probably be like saving up for a
car or something like I have a car now
but or don't even get me started it
doesn't even really do 100 on the
highway so yeah I should definitely be
saying up for a car but no I shop
instead and waste all my money on
clothes and makeup
I probably watch Mean Girls like 40
times my whole life it'll never be old
to me I absolutely love it like if I
don't know what maybe to watch I'll just
go straight to me and girls it's just
like my all-time favorite movie
I would say that I do own a lot of
clothes like my whole cupboard is full
and I'm gonna have to start getting new
storage spaces and stuff like that but I
like to buy new clothes frequently so I
just sell my old stuff like on eBay or I
just give it away or something so we all
have my email link down below and check
out that be outside that I do are in
like a lot of clothes
I don't take photos of my food only
because I never ever like go out to
fancy restaurants or anything like that
I just go to Lac MCEs and hold this
breath and stuff like that so yeah I was
I'm going to take photos of that but if
I was to go out to like a really fancy
place I probably would take photos
I definitely don't want makeup everyday
unless I was like really busy that week
and I was going out every single day but
I highly doubt that ever happens to me
I'm usually just sitting in my bed or
going to work or hang out my boyfriend
and I don't want makeup for any of them
occasions so yeah
I would probably say that my average
grade would have to be a B or C
especially at the start of the year
because I always tend to like try really
hard at the star and get like A's and
B's and then by the end of the year it's
like these and C's sometimes even a D
well that was really in math because
like it was really hard but yeah
I would say that I usually have my hair
to stuff in a soft bun because it's so
easy but to be honest I don't only style
my hair I just like leave it how it is
because it's naturally straight I'm so
lucky of that yeah I'm just like
horrible when it comes to hair i'm so
clueless there artists need to work on
that one
I would say probably like 80% of the
time I try to look presentable but
sometimes I just get really lazy like
yesterday I went down to Woolworths in
my pajamas like when no one was there
anything but yeah sometimes I just get a
bit lazy and then other times I like go
all out so yeah it just really depends
but I would say probably like yeah 80%
of the time so that is all for this
common white girl tag I really hope you
guys enjoyed it something just a little
bit different if as usual I don't want
to bore you guys so I thought I would
change it up a bit and if you do like
these kind of videos please let me know
in the comments below and if you have
any requests on some other videos that
want to see just let me know as well and
I'll be happy to do that so yeah that is
all so until next time I'll see you
later bye all you ladies pop your pussy
like this shake your body don't stop
don't miss all you ladies pop your pussy
like this shake your body toaster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
