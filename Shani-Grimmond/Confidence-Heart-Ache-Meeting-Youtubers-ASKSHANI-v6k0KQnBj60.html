my channel it has been a fair few weeks
since I filmed a proper video so I
thought I'd sit down and do a catch-up
kind of Q&amp;amp;A video with you all I asked
you guys on Twitter to ask me questions
and there's so many and I'm really
excited to update you guys so let's go
ahead and get started the first thing on
and talk about is there's something in
my eyeball that's really annoying me a
second of all second of all I want to
talk about amplify and how amazing it
was I did do a vlog on the first three
days of amplify it's just like a tour
around Australia with a bunch of other
youtubers and singers and all of that
and it was so much fun I met the most
amazing people and I was so sad to leave
like I actually cried being Chloe in the
in the car crying on the way home
because we didn't want to like leave
anyone in my hair it's me doing but yeah
I made some really amazing friends so
sad to leave them all I wanted to take
them home with me but I'm gonna be
keeping in contact with all them anyway
especially Kirk common literally he is
the best person I've ever met at stage
she is so beautiful tired I made such
good friends with all of them and they
live so far away but the most exciting
part of that whole tour was meeting you
guys and seriously every time I met when
you guys my heart melted every single
person that I met made me want to just
keep doing YouTube videos even more you
guys inspire me so much and I just can't
thank you guys enough because you are
the reason why I am where I am today and
the reason why I'm so happy today
because I'm doing a job that I love I
just love sitting here in front of my
camera and talking it's so good I love
it through Slee and I also got a lot of
notes and presents from you guys which
is ridiculous I did not expect to get
any of that it was just so amazing to
just put a face to the name that was the
best part of the whole trip but yeah
that's pretty much all that I have to
say for amplify it was amazing I can't
wait to do it again hopefully there's
one coming out really soon and if not
the next year I'm pumped I'm ready I
didn't go on stage as you guys would
know that I went to the show because
I get through a serious serious resource
I never felt a little anxiety when I'm
on stage like it is ridiculous you'd be
lucky to see me doing like an overlap
school in front of the class like no I
tried I was trying to talk myself into
it so much and so was everyone else I
come on stage even just to like dance a
bit I'm like who wants to watch me dance
like not happy no and then also while I
was in Sydney I got my tooth fix because
I chipped it and I go to dr. Lazarus he
is the most amazing dentist he's the one
that did my composite veneers so I had
gaps alot all throughout my teeth and he
fixed them all he did an amazing job so
shout out to you dr. Lazarus I can't
even lift my arms up because this is so
like annoying anyways let's get straight
into these questions because I feel like
we've got a lot to do first question is
related to amplify so why not who did
you become a closest with an amplifier I
would have to say Kirk Holman I never
thought that I would become as close
with anyone at a like a YouTube Tour
than I did with Kurt he was he's just so
genuine and so confident within himself
and it it expect a little I cannot speak
I know it inspires me so much to just
like love myself and love Who I am and I
don't know I just got goose bumps
I love cuts so much just his outlook on
life everything about him is just so
beautiful and it makes me happy and his
vibes make me happy so the next one is
where do see yourself in five years I
actually have no idea where I'm gonna be
in five years I never plan things all I
want to be in five years is to be happy
I'm happy right now that's all I want in
life is to be happy obviously I do want
to be successful but I would definitely
put my happiness before my success which
for some people isn't the case but for
me
that's my first priority
so happiness did you honestly enjoy it
in Perth when you came or did you think
we're all flop slow I actually have a
really interesting story about this one
so overall Perth was amazing like when I
was first driving there but driving to
the destination I were going to you from
the airport I was looking around and I'm
like this place is so beautiful I've
literally never seen a place so just
like relaxing and chilled I don't know
when I looked around it just looks so
nice and like clean and fresh I knew how
to describe it but it was so so
beautiful
so we just went to our apartment and
then Kurt Chloe and I went to the shops
to get a camera cut out I hate that I'm
Chloe Kurt and I went to the shots to
get some alcohol and we're just walking
along and Curtin really gets bash so I'm
like ripping him out of the middle and
then I was like man okay this isn't a
very good start so then we went to the
bottle low to get alcohol and people
were waiting at the front to bash us and
I'm like what the hell is going on right
now like it was I in the bad place of
Perth was I not in the right place at
the right time I have no idea but that
was so so scary we're waiting in IgA for
like the bottle oh it was at the same
place like though next to each other
we're waiting for like 30 minutes to get
picked up and it was freaking scary like
I don't know I don't know what happened
but yeah other than that I would
definitely consider moving to Perth it
is such a beautiful and like homely kind
of feel there I went to like all the
like suburb areas because I went to an
after party for the amplifi thing and it
was just so beautiful in there and I'm
like I want to live here but then I
couldn't leave my family here and I'm
just like hope oh yeah love you flop
next question is have you ever had your
heart broken if you have how did you
deal with it I wouldn't say that I've
had my heart broken but I could go
through a stage where I kind of got left
around by a guy and it really really
hurt I feel like I was hurting for like
three or so months I even went to the
doctors and I was like what is wrong
with me why am I so upset over this like
I shouldn't be so upset over just a boy
it was bad it was really really hard but
what you have to do is surround yourself
with positive people and people that I'm
gonna bring you up don't surround
yourself with negative people cuz it's
literally the last thing that you want
while you're upset just trying to strike
yourself I know it's hard
I know I said in my room four days after
days let's just say weeks up two weeks
in my room just crying and crying but I
mean let all of the tears out and then a
men distract yourself that's what I
think's best I mean it's not it's not
ideal to kind of bottle up all of these
feelings like I definitely think it's
what I do to let all these feelings out
and tell someone maybe tell a good
friend or write it down in a diary
that's what I did
I have pages and pages of just like my
emotions in a diary and it made me feel
so much better I felt so much more
relieved now once you come out of the
tunnel you will see the light and it's
just so much better you're having your
back where you were when you started
if you're happy before you meet someone
you can be happy when they leave so I
definitely think it's hard going through
a kind of breakup or heartbreak or
whatever you want to call it but it does
get easier it just takes a lot of time
and a lot of support from people around
you I think that's just that's all I can
really say that's not there's not like a
little bit there's not really like a
magic trick and that can be like this is
what you're gonna do to get over someone
or this is what you gonna do when you're
in a heartbreak like there's nothing you
can really do and it sucks but that's
life that's life honey the next question
is how many more confident around new
people and I'll just say fake it until
you make it just to make sure that you
start the conversation because you know
when there's two people in a room and
one person doesn't say hello so then the
other person doesn't say hello but if
one person said it and this person was
saying and then you've got a friendship
like all you have to do is put your foot
down make the first step usually people
are scared of too
usually people are scared of making the
first step and that's where everything
goes wrong so if you say hey first you
start a conversation you put some effort
in that's how you get the ball rolling
and I feel like that's being confident
sorry
so there we have my question and answers
video I just feel like this was well
needed because it's been a while since
I've sat down and just had a chat with
you all so I have a question to ask you
guys well I haven't thought of it yet my
question for you guys is where do you
live and how old you and watch your name
and live it in the comments below so I
can get to know you guys better because
I think it's meet everyone on the fo $5
road well I didn't get to meet everyone
amplified tour says let's get to know
each other a bit more down in the
comments I love you guys so much and I
will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
