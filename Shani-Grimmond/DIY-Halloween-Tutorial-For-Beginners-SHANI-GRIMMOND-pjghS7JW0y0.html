going to do is just apply foundation on
a half of my face just so half of it
looks alive and the other half just
looks like a pure mess so as you can see
at the start there was a little bit of
like mistake showing through but this is
my first time doing it so I was like
whatever I'm just gonna put it up holy
crap that was a huge people time to
conceal those bags so I'm taking my
knives a radiant creamy concealer in a
shade
custard and just putting this in and it
gives a really nice highlighted effect
love this stuff and then of course just
sitting it down with a powder to keep it
nice and highlighted and to make sure it
doesn't crease and now filling in my big
bushy eyebrows so I'm using the
anastacio brow duo this is the most
amazing formula to use on your brows I
swear to god it just goes on so nicely
and it's really easy to overdraw at your
brows so justifying them a little bit
and wallah and then of course adding
some runs out to my cheekbones so this
is the Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil I
always go overboard with my bronzed up I
guess it's because I haven't done my
makeup in like a month so I was just
like how do you even do this and then
applying some blush is just a makeup
geek blush I will leave the name of it
down below because I completely forget
but just popping this on the apples of
my cheeks for mascara I'm taking my
trusty one that I've been using for
years now and I love it it is the
L'Oreal telescopic edge to black makes
my lashes so big when in reality they're
tiny tiny okay so time to start with the
ugly old scratchy bloody thing on the
face so I'm taking some spirit gum and
just popping this little by little at a
time so I'll put some on and then put
some cotton balls on top and I make sure
to really like spread them out so
they're not super thick so they're nice
and thin so yeah I just keep applying it
until half of my face is covered it's
that's really fun
oh and I just came out with the best
idea ever if you want to be Santa Claus
for Halloween here you go
you look like Santa and now taking
summer liquid latex so I'm taking this
on a q-tip and just gently rubbing this
all over the face the reason why we put
the cotton ball down is to add some more
like texture to the face to make it look
more real so around the edges of the
wound I'm going to make sure to like
smooth it out so it's like a choppy line
so once that's tried a bit I'm gonna
take a little knife yeah I wouldn't
recommend this at home I would just like
you to think isn't peel it and just kind
of it lifts it up a bit to make it look
more realistic and flaky YUM well I
haven't painted my face since I was
grade 1 so I had a lot of fun doing this
throw just taking some red body paint
this is kind of like a really light red
so this makes the skin look really
irritated and I'm just using a sponge to
Pat this down and I did make a mistake
and that was letting the red I meant
letting the white show through still so
it looked a bit dodgy there but I mean I
had fun doing it so yeah just patting
this all over as like the bottom coat
and in some parts of making a bit darker
than others just so it looks more
realistic then of course taking some
more colors because I wanted to look
actually real so dried up blood usually
goes like a gross dark red kind of
colour so I'm taking a black face paint
and just starting this on and blending
it out and then taking a burgundy brown
color and popping this under my eyes oh
and if you don't notice I put some eye
contacts in these are from cosmetics
Plus this is so freaky and then taking a
purple body paint so I'm just starting
this on my face but not too much because
obviously a cut isn't purple but I just
wanted to add some more color in there
and just of course blending it out again
time to add some Aladdin guts sir I'm
going to be taking a really dark red
gooey thick blood and I'm just putting
this in certain areas of the face so
where the cut would be worse I put a lot
of blood on and then I kind of just
spread it out then everywhere else I
don't even know if I'm making sense
right now but it's not every day that I
talk about blood and then I'm getting a
sponge and kind of just patting it on my
face to blend it out a tiny bit and then
taking that knife thing again and just
making the word seem a bit more deep huh
and then taking a spray boat wait what
did I just say a spray version of some
blood and just taking that from my eye
and letting it drip down and then with
the same color that I put under my eye
I'm just gonna put this in my lips so
I'm making them look like a bum hole and
then rubbing the brush in there so I
look dead and there we have the finished
look I hope you guys liked it please
don't forget to give this a thumbs up
and thank you guys so much for 500k Ike
seriously thank you I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in my next video
which will be very soon I promise I love
you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
