tutorial using only my favorite products
of life so it's kind of like a favorites
video in a makeup tutorial so I'm going
to start with my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot this is incredible I talked about
this in every single video it basically
just covers any veins on my eyelids and
makes the eyeshadow stay on longer now
taking my Rimmel stay matte powder I'm
just going to use this to set my eyelid
this stuff is incredible and it is so
cheap it works in so many different ways
as well you can use it to set under the
eyes you can use it to set the whole
face and also to bake so it's like a
win-win product next I'm taking the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade
makeup geek eyeshadows aren't my
favorite brands my favorite whole girl
my favorite formula they just blend so
seamlessly on the eye they're really
pigmented and intense and just
everything you would want in an
eyeshadow now I'm taking the shade
frappe it's really quite sad that I know
all these names off by heart a little
obsessed whoops so this one's okay I
really need some help with my voice box
today sorry about that
this one's going directly in the crease
just to add some definition that I'm
going to take a really big fat blending
brush and buff it out so it's super
seamless you know what's next girl just
cleaning up that eye shadow to make a
super harsh line and also picking up the
fallout for the lid color I'm taking the
shade grandstander this is a beautiful
foiled eyeshadow I'm just going to pack
this all over the lid for a nice pop of
shimmer and then of course I'm going to
take a blending brush for the last time
and give her a whirl
now taking my little baby this is the
Bobby Brown vitamin and rich of face
space it just provides a really nice
base for the foundation to sit on
especially if you do have a dry skin it
just really nourishes it and I find that
the foundation goes on super smooth over
the top of this as well for foundation
I'm taking the Too Faced Born This Way
at this one's in the shade a warm beige
and you know what is super annoying it
usually I have a different tan on and it
matches perfectly but today that is not
the case so this one is my favorite
foundation of all time it has a really
nice medium to full coverage the finish
is beautiful and there are a lot of
colors in the color range so I'm just
super happy with this foundation it is
my second bottle now now for concealer
I'm taking the urban decay and Naked
skin concealer I really like this one
because especially the applicator just
applies it so well and it applies so
much product at once so it just makes it
easy for me because I like to apply a
lot of concealer the shade that I have
is spot-on
I really like to highlight under the
eyes and of course the formula last but
not least is amazing one of the best
actually not the best formulas I've ever
used in a concealer it doesn't crease
and it covers everything you want to
cover now it's time for a little bit of
cream contouring i'm taking my Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in the shade 6.5
the main reason I love this is because
it adds a little bit of extra coverage
on my cheeks while on contouring usually
when I use other products it kind of
fades away the foundation and you can
see a little bit of acne sky on my
cheeks so I really love this one and
number two the fact that the shade is
just so bronzy and warm tone is just
right up my alley and it's just such a
beautiful color so I'm putting this
under my cheekbones and also around the
sides of my head to make it look like a
hat went out fat in the Sun gotcha now
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
loose setting powder I'm using this to
bake under my eyes I've gone through two
of these tubs now I absolutely swear by
this product but I did just find a
product that was a lot cheaper and that
I liked just as much if not more but I'm
still testing it out before I put it in
my favorites so I'll keep you guys
updated
for the brows I'm taking the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in the
shade and medium brown i like this one
because it just applies it really easily
it's like a pomade gel moussey
consistency and it also lasts a really
long time as well lag when surprisingly
if it's waterproof I also take my Laura
Mercier powder all over my face to set
everything down and honey that stuff
doesn't budge at all for the brows I'm
taking the tint my brow Astralis brow
tint just to add some texture in my
brows oh my god I have like 20 of these
oh I love it so much and it's so cheap
with a really light hand I'm taking the
shade by makeup geek in the shade White
Lies I'm just putting this directly
under my eyebrow to add a little bit of
a highlight but nothing too dramatic
picking up the shade frappe and putting
this from in a corner to add a corner to
even out the eyeshadow look that I'm
going in with a shade chickadee pretty
much putting this over the top just for
a nice wash of like yellowy orange I
think this is the coolest color I love
so much going in with my L'Oreal
telescopic extra black mascara this one
has been a favorite of mine for at least
two years now it is really good at just
separating the lashes and making them
super long and the wand is just really
easy to apply I've never had a problem
with like poking my skin and getting
black everywhere it's just really really
good definitely recommend this one now
taking the Tarte in a rim liner this is
kind of like a skin tone shade but a few
turns later so it really opens up that
water line I do think my eyes are really
sensitive to this product I'm not too
sure if it is as product I think it is
so which is really sad now taking my
Lillie lashes in the style J makeup this
is my favorite brand
along with huda beauty just because they
last so incredibly long now for
contouring i'm taking the hoola benefit
bronzer everyone and their mums love
this product the shade is just really
good because it doesn't get ashy if you
put too much on it just makes the cheeks
look so snatched the brush i'm using is
the eda brush by NARS and it applies any
contour so you
silly and really harsh to add a bit of
color into the face I'm taking the Mac
bronzer in the shade it give me Sun I
honestly cannot believe that this
product is still alive like I thought I
would have used it all by now so just
warming up my face putting this on my
cheekbones around the whole perimeter of
my face and it just adds that beautiful
beautiful sunkissed glow I cannot
recommend this bronzer enough now taking
my Taylor blue contour kit and picking
up the shade at number two it's really
weird to say this but it almost feels
like this product is most driving under
the eyes a lot of powders seem to go
really crusty and flaky looking like
really dry but this one isn't dry at all
it's really smooth and buttery
so just highlighting where ever I want
to be brighter I haven't used the
contouring shades yet but I will keep
you guys updated because I'm sure
they're just as good when it comes to
blush I don't particularly have a
favorite brand or a favorite color I
pretty much just use whatever and they
all seem to work for me so this is the
Mac blush in the shade margin it's a
really nice pinky coral shade with a lot
of shimmer and I'm all about that glow
speaking of glow I'm taking the Jeffrey
style highlight in the shade King Tut
this is the most pigmented creamy
highlight I've ever used it is the most
intense highlight I've ever used and it
is stunning like what the like what
the the lip liner that I'm using
today is from Too Faced I've been using
this one for so many months and there's
still product left in there and I don't
really know how but it's just super easy
to apply because it's creamy it's a
retractable lip pencil so you don't have
to sharpen it that really grinds my
gears yeah I really like it
so now going in with my Geoffrey start
liquid lipstick in the shade Mikan it is
such a beautiful shade like an everyday
new deep pink it is absolutely stunning
it lasts a pretty long time the only
thing I don't like about it is it reeks
it smells really bad I'm sure some
people would like to smell bad to start
now taking my Kylie Jenner lip gloss
this is the lightest shade I'm just
going to douse my lips in this because I
love a glossy lip this
is such a gorgeous color so here we have
the finished look I really hope you guys
like it I think it is stunning I just
feel so glam and put together every
product in this video as you would know
is 100% 10 out of 10 I love you guys so
much and I'll speak to you very soon bye
look at that hair flip bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
