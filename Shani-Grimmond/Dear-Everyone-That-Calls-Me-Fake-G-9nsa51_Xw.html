channel so in today's video I just want
to sit down with you all and have a
little chat - it's been a while since
have fled town with you guys so I've
been seeing a few comments on my
Instagram photos and I kind of just
wanted to address them because I feel
like younger people that would see those
type of comments would think it's okay
to say those things to people and I just
wanted to address it because it's not
okay to say these type of things to
people so a few people have been saying
that I've changed I'm so fake now I miss
the old shiny bring the old shiny back
and I'm just sitting here like what
makes you feel like you can say that
I've dyed my hair I've got a boob job
I've got my eyebrows hold on I've got
fake teeth
 fake lips literally I have done
so many different things with my body
but at the end of the day I'm still the
same person I would still say that I am
very genuine very honest I still have
all of those traits about me the only
things that have changes physical
appearance and that just comes down to
me wanting to do it because unhappy with
doing that with myself and I just want
to change a few things I mean I could
take my breast implants out I could take
these out I could let my lips dissolve I
could let my eyebrows fade off I could
dye my hair back natural color like all
of those things I could do I could take
my nails off I could take my fake tan
off and at the end of the day I'm still
gonna be that same person I'm just not
gonna be as confident you know what I
mean like I just don't see why people
feel the need to have to say that kind
of stuff and I'm not affected by it at
all like I'm honestly fine with it I've
been dealing with online hate for so
many years now I've been doing youtube
since I was grade 11 grade 10 so I'm
completely like I mean people can say
whatever they want and I really don't
mind but I just want people to know that
if you want to do something to your body
if you don't wanna do something to your
body it's totally fine it's your body
you can do whatever you want if you want
to dye your hair pink dye your hair pink
if you want to get nails get nails I can
honestly it doesn't matter because at
the end of the day all that's important
is how you feel about yourself and the
fact that you're genuine you love
yourself you have amazing friends and
that's really all that matters as a fly
in here
why does that always happen like come
over yeah obviously everyone changes
when they grow up like that's a part of
life you grow up you're mature you learn
things about yourself you find yourself
you find new friends you lose friends so
many things happen in life but does it
really matter what this looks like I
think so as long as you're happy with it
and to be completely honest with you I
was actually questioning getting a boob
job just because I was scared that
people think I'm fake now because I've
always loved the idea of like me being
very natural like when I was growing up
under I felt like I was pretty
good-looking like in high school psycho
yeah I'm cute whatever I hadn't done
anything to my body I was completely
natural and everyone used to say oh I
love how you're so natural like little
blah and like yeah so do i I loved I
loved the fact that I was super natural
and I kind of let that hold me back from
doing stuff that I wanted to do whether
it was dressing a certain way or getting
my boobs done or whatever it may have
been I was really scared because I did
want people thinking I was saying I was
scared to dye my hair I different color
I was like oh my god all of these things
are adding up and I look like a fake
bitch but it really doesn't work like
that yes I think natural beauty is so
beautiful so amazing but if you want to
change things whose just don't pee
honestly I just think people need a
focus on themselves and what's inside
and make sure they're happy because I
know for myself for the past like four
weeks now I haven't been doing very well
and I haven't told anyone
oh god I'm sorry I feel emotional
um yeah because my boobs have been
healing I've had to recover in bed for a
lot of the time and for me I love my
learn time but it's really hard being
alone all the time and like for the
first two weeks is my big job recovery I
didn't see anyone for two weeks
actually I saw I saw what two people in
two weeks as much as I love my job so
much like I actually would never trade
this for the world
it's kind of hard for me because I'm
always alone and I choose to be alone I
could be going out doing photo shoots I
could be going on doing all these crazy
opportunities that I'm offered but I'm
scared and I know it might sound like
I'm contradicting myself because I don't
I said I don't care that people are
saying all this stuff about me it's it's
honestly not that it's completely
different I think like I don't know if
any of you guys know but I've grown up
with like social anxiety so I'm
perfectly fine
talking to a camera because no one's
here around me to like judge me I guess
but when it comes to like real life and
me actually having to talk in front of a
group of people that's when I'm like oh
my god so that's kind of how I feel when
I like leave the house to go hang out
with new people I'm like oh my god this
is very scary sometimes I'm completely
fine which leave the most confident
person in the world I can make
conversation so easily and this day is
my wake up and I just have really bad
anxiety I'm like oh my god someone's
gonna laugh at me like overthinking and
that's kind of where I've been in the
past like three to four weeks because
I've been like isolating myself from
everyone because I've been trying to let
these heal so it's kind of like getting
worse and worse as I don't actually go
out and socialize and meet new people
and stuff usually I'd hate to tell
people this I hate telling people that
I'm upset or whatever and honestly like
I'm fine I'm I'm really happy but like
I've been sad so I kinda just want to
tell you guys this so I can help a few
of you guys cuz I know a lot of people
would be kind of in the same position
even though we have different jobs and
stuff it's still you know having anxiety
and putting yourself out there is always
scary to a lot of people so my tips to
you ah
is what I'm doing go to the gym start up
the gym find a gym buddy because I know
it's very scary to go by itself it's so
intimidating I feel like that really
helps you grow to feel confident with
yourself because obviously you have to
put yourself out there in front of other
people even though no one even watches
what you're doing when you're at the gym
but I think that's a really great way to
feel confident about yourself in true
ways going and doing all these things in
front of other people like all do
exercises and also feeling better about
your body I think that's like the core
of your happiness and your confidence
obviously it's loving yourself and am I
gonna have made a video like this and so
on this is weird I love these kind of
chats like I loved even meaningful chats
that I never do it on my channel but
this is really like Who I am like I'm so
invested in how I feel and how other
people feel I love I love talking other
people about their problems and helping
them and like all that and I haven't
done in a while because I've been sorry
scared to like open up about it that I
haven't been happy but honestly so many
people have problems and that's totally
fine and whether they're like horrible
problems or problems like mine like my
problems aren't I wouldn't say bad but
everyone's allowed to have problems and
be upset sometimes and that's fine and
that's a part of life and finding
yourself and everything and the past
like few weeks where I have kind of been
like isolating myself I have learnt a
lot about myself and I've learned that
Jim is amazing for so many people
including myself for getting myself out
there I'm gonna start doing classes and
everything eating healthy is so
important it makes such
difference honestly it makes such a big
difference in your mood in your energy
and that all affects like your day to
day life I sure as hell know
procrastinating is a thing a very
powerful thing and you've really just
got to get up and do what you need to do
you'll feel so much better what I like
to do is get a diary write everything in
diary with my cue pen from so I put the
diamond at the end and then I have a
highlighter so once I've done the task
I'll highlight it off so I can feel
accomplished with everything that I've
done so that really helps me a lot to
just keep on track with what I need to
do
feeling good about myself once I've
ticked everything off the box so just
really pushing yourself to do things and
you'll notice a massive massive
difference
Jim eating healthy keeping track of
everything being organized and of course
the most important thing of all is
making sure you have people around you
to talk to about how you're feeling and
hopefully finding someone that
understands why you're feeling and that
can give you a little bit of advice
because you know when you're
overthinking so much it does get like
very overwhelming so it's really nice to
talk to someone a person and for them to
tell you that it's gonna be okay
everyone gets upset it's totally fine
and that you can be past this you can
repass anything if you really set your
mind to it and you focus on getting
better and being better I know I come
across as this really happy quirky
confident go and I am I definitely am I
love my life I love everyone in it I
love my job
there's so many things to be grateful
for and I am but I still have my days
where I'm like my life like I'm so
upset and that's totally fine to feel
like that I just want you guys to know
that it's okay to have down days it's
okay to be sad it's okay to vent to
people in your life and and you just get
all of your feelings out there and it's
a good ask for help as well if you want
help and if you think that's going to
make you happier more confident within
yourself I kinda just want to make this
video so you guys know so everyone knows
that no one has that perfect life that
everyone wants you have to be happy with
what's in front of you if you're not
happy with what's in front of you do
better focus on what you want to change
and change it because you can and your
will if you focus trust me you can't
live your life in your little bubble
you've got to venture out if you want to
have a good life don't be comfortable in
your little compass or Nestle boring you
want to get out there and show the world
you and the best version of you so yeah
I hope you guys learned a little bit
from this video I love you so much
I feel a lot better now I'm kind of see
it's what this video
I don't like to like talking to people
about how I feel unless I really really
trust them and obviously this is opening
a door up for like so many people to
know a bit more about my personal life
and it's really scary but I know that
this video will help a lot of you guys
that are at home and you're feeling a
bit upset and it's totally totally fine
you just need to work on being a better
you that's all
and you can do it I love you guys and
I'll see you soon and I know I repeated
myself a million times bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
