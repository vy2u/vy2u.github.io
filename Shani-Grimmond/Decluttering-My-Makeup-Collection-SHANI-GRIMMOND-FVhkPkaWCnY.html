today's video I'm doing a makeup
declutter I am so excited to be doing
this video is literally a fetish for me
to watch these types of videos I just
find it so therapeutic it is just so
calming for me to watch I don't know why
this video definitely isn't for everyone
but I just want to say that all of the
products that I am getting rid of are
either going through my friends family
or lifeline or any sort of charity or
anything like that so they are going to
a good cause I am making sure to
sanitize anything I am giving away - not
my friends or family since they can have
the dirty version of anything every
weekend and of course I just want to say
I'm not bashing any Brandis I'm getting
rid of any of their products every
single brand in my cupboard I love and a
lot of products work a lot of products
don't like that's just how makeup brands
go so I just thought I'd give it to
people that would use the products more
so that's really the only reason I'm
doing this I hope you guys enjoy this
video and let's go ahead and jump right
in
well okay so you are my vlogging camera
and you are on my big camera so we can
sort through all of my makeup these two
drawers we have my mascara so let's
start here you want to make sure you
always go through my scars just because
after like six or so months they're
going to be off anyway so first thing we
have right here is the Mac lashes
Maximizer this is just like a white
primer product you put on your lashes
before mascara to make them longer but I
never reach for this I leave the
literally once and I didn't notice it
was like amazing so that one's some gold
next up we have this luxe mascara this
is the brand - Avon I just don't think
it's really like necessary to keep this
one because no one really knows this
brand so there's no point promoting it
in my videos the next one is this
Maybelline the falsies push-up dry like
this one is really good except it is
super wet like it's just transferred
everywhere so we do have some assistance
cards and I am going to keep these
lunches because when I do drugstore
tutorials I want to make sure that
everyone can like pull it on your knees
so some people don't want to get
high-end products from ministry
drugstore as well so we have a few cover
gamma scars which I love so so much so
I'm going to make sure they're not dried
out because I have had it for a while on
that sounds like fluff Lynette I think I
did a have to go a distance car and I
put cotton balls inside of it yes I'll
get rid of that one in case I get fluff
in my lashes and I could cool with my
are be itchy and then the whole makeup
through and so thank you this one is the
same one just different packaging this
one is wet yes I'm keeping up then we
have my L'Oreal telescopic mascara these
are my favorite guards of all times
there's a nearly empty I probably have a
few more uses and others as well I'm not
going to waste anything if I love it
sorry then we have the hot lights camera
lashes and scara's I think these are new
from when I went on the Hayman Island
trip so let's see if they work yep that
one's good I do like these discard as
well I just should have only had one in
here at a time so I'm just going to put
one on the glass or that stop recording
I was like no I'm just going to put one
in my drawer down the bottom so I kind
of choose one time then we have three
better than sex mascara again I don't
need all three in this drawer that's
just there any kids it's just making it
be done then it needs to be so I'm going
to put the little one in the other
drawer down here and then I'm going to
see what one is the wettest out of these
two that one looks good
so does that one if you're wondering
eyes like a massive box behind me where
I have like makeup it I'm yet to use and
stuff so in cars and of course we have
to roller lashes from benefit oh my god
that is fully empty that's going then we
have another one that's probably
emptying it at the right okay that's all
for this car I'm going to keep the rest
then we have all of these sponges right
here I definitely use these be blenders
every single day the Real Techniques one
is good to kind of change things up and
then this multi one is pretty good as
well but I am going to get rid of those
two Rimmel one and I'm going to get rid
of these two morphe ones as well because
I don't know already bought this my hair
and that's not for me so I just got all
the new benefit products so I can check
my old ones that I've had these for so
long anyway so goodbye we have here my
brow pen by ectasia
I don't really like this like I just I
never reach for it I know I'm never
going to use
it I want to keep it but I'm not going
to use it so what the heck is the point
I need it supporting all this stuff this
is going ok now moving on to my pomade
we have 2 from heart and I only really
need one so I'm just going to see what
color suits me best so I could
definitely never see myself using this
one I'm producer Michael user last time
so maybe I'll give it to him and also we
have this one from NYX I have had this
for literally over a year and I've never
used it so see ya ok so let's move on to
the second drawer we have all of my
eyeliners and concealers let's start
with the NARS creamy concealer so sent
me all the range and obviously I only
need a few depending on like how can a
lot I answer I am going to keep these
two right here Chantilly and medium one
custard and then I'm going to get rid of
these three here because they're true
light for me or to pink next we have the
Naked skin concealer oh my god this one
surely has to be off I've had it for so
long so that one can go we also have
this one from ELF and honestly I just
don't think of any use this one as I
don't really like the stick formulas
because they're so dry under the eyes
obviously if they can stay in this
little package then they're probably
going to be drawn unto us we also have
this Make Up For Ever one this one is
the full cover
I've had this Asian I never use it so
I'm going to get rid of that line so you
have this corner if I conceal that looks
a little too dark for me because in deep
chance I'm going to get rid of that one
I might keep this essence one just
because it's affordable I never use this
dream Lumi by Maybelline I literally
have never ever used it we have another
stick one from else I don't really want
this one from ELF was oh great I like
that I might keep that one because I
can't remember if I liked it or not I
also have another one from L'Oreal that
I'm going to get rid of or I'm not going
to keep this on from pixie because as
you can see it is seriously just peach
and I really have two bad as dark sides
was under there so it doesn't really
come in handy for me then we also have
this one from Napoleon Kurdish I'm not
going to keep that one just because I
personally think many people have been
using polynomials okay
let's take it back a notch into this row
we have all my perfumes which I never
use obviously they smell so good for
getting rid of those I have this Jeffrey
start to lower lip scrub which smells so
beautiful
oh I just can't eat it on a sleep spot I
have had a use this before sorry
oh here is that if my lips are dry I
just put some lip balm on them so I
don't know why away from my money there
next we have this lip scrub by tot maybe
I'll keep that one because it seems like
it's an easier formula to work with you
just literally brush on your lips I
don't really like having to linger in
products like the Jeffrey seller so I'll
keep this one next up we have the Mac
24-hour extended eye base I'm just going
to see if you have color to it because I
always like to conceal my eyes yeah no I
have no color to it so it's not going to
fix any like vain there anything popping
through somebody get rid of that one
well that because of YouTube I didn't
work out for me alright let's move on to
the eyeliners and stuff so I may get rid
of these ones from nude textures because
they are really sick so I don't really I
mean you can put this on your eyelid as
an eye base but I don't really ever do
that so I'm going to rid of that one and
also you need rid of the other true nude
sticks as well so industrial we have all
my bronze kind of eyeliners I don't know
why I have so many I love this gel
eyeliner so I'm going to keep that one
the color foot ones are really good I
don't like this color from colour-pop so
I think it's like a trifle I'm gonna get
rid of that one I'm gonna get rid of
this Mac liquid liner I never use the
Cavanaugh's because I suck at eyeliner
this one from la girl doesn't have a lid
so that's not very sanitary when you're
rid of that so back here we have some
more liquid liners I mean it really is
open to Kavon because it's very liquidy
I guess I'm just going to go ahead and
pick out the ones that are didn't like
so I don't like this pinky color I don't
like this maybe all this one all the
gray all the silver oh my gosh
okay so this next rule is like needs
help
okay so let's start with this section
right here definitely a few that I want
to get rid of to this or do you like
going to read them but I'm eager to this
alpha and just because it's true light
for a bronzer for me
and then in this section we have two of
these friends on Chavez I don't like
these ones that first we've had a
foundation and if you guys have seen
other videos I was using them they
literally don't add any coverage at all
and I don't like they set this case very
well sore I get rid of these ones then
we have some from Avon again I don't
really think anyone uses a sprint also
there's no point of me using it in
videos I only keep stuff that is in
videos anyway then I have an oz paddle
this one is I mean really bad I don't
like this one I you just encrusted I
hate the year it does not set safe don't
like it so we have another one from the
brand radical this is just a banana
powder I don't really put on a pattern
under my eyes except there if they're in
a contour palette because I feel like
that only time I'll pull them out and if
I go to contour like oh maybe I'll put
some but I'll show you my eye so I don't
really know what this brand is all about
it up so I don't think anyone really no
surprises you have just haven't dropped
it so we do have to tap on deep patters
I'm going to give one of these away and
Hirani actually said she wanted this one
and then I have two of the Rimmel
transparent powders I love these so much
size E flat so re how long time ago is
these true and also I only get reduce
Australis been on the powder because I
do have the contour kit that has this
one in it then we have some bare
minerals powders let's see what the
colors look like so I have these two I'm
gonna get rid of this one he looks a bit
too light and that one looks too dark
actually I might keep the lighter ones
when I'm pale because that could work
but the other ones like completely trade
offs and that's not going to work at all
next we have this one from it makeup
forever this one's a powder foundation
and I never lean towards this one firm
and tuck this one out well give it away
oh man oh my god how could I forget so
we have this one from bareMinerals this
is a concealer and a powder form which i
think is not the best for me because my
under eyes are quite dry so it's going
to really cling to all the wrinkles
matters into powder concealer is there
really any better than a concealer in a
cream form so this is going and we have
this radical bronzer I'm here in that
one because again no one really knows
brands
this one's a little bit messy because I
just got like heaps packages so it's
overflowing so we do have a few things
on the top that I already know I want to
get real because I using the other day
so it's Inglot sparkling dust I already
have two of these right here in
different shades have you heard of that
one because I don't want a lot and then
we have these ones from artis Couture
which I think are actually like way too
dark to you as highlighted or I'm gonna
get rid of these yeah I just started my
you know life's watch them and I'm not
amazed then we have this one from Glory
minerals but oh this is a banana powder
okay
getting rid of that one as well and then
we also have this one from glow minerals
which is a highlighter it's so pretty
but I just I'm using a beautiful and I
loved it but again no others where the
heck to get it okay so here we have a
blush from Too Faced and we don't rid of
just because I think the packaging is I
mean you know what I mean and this is
probably like a holiday collection as
well so no point using that videos if
you can't get it girl
and then this one here which is a bronze
oh my god this one's going as well
because it's way too dark I use this in
a video a day and it's like literally
orange it's for people that have darker
skin tones in me sort um yeah that's why
it doesn't work for me so I'll give that
away we have some elf blushes right here
which oh wow that's like a highlight
isn't it
I might add that in my highlight section
over here we have this blush as well
which is true shimmery I don't have to
hold up
oh no I think I'm going to get rid of
that one okay so right here we have some
of my artists - a highlighter so I don't
think all of these shades would work for
me to start of this one's too dark
let me have a look yeah that was my
shade LeBrons I'll get rid of that one
let's move on to the foundation drawer I
have so many foundations in here too
let's just go through what I do and
don't want so let's start over here with
the elf foundations I'm gonna get rid of
this one just because it looks very
orange I don't think that color is going
to work for me then we have the lock
sound ations again I've never
these I don't really think there's a
point on keeping them then we have to
covergirl foundations and this one's my
shade this one's not so I'm going to get
rid of that one so right here we have
for urban decay foundations I definitely
don't need all of them so I'm just going
to take the lightest shade in here this
one is seriously way too lightly under I
would never be this pale I do have two
of the wake me up foundations I do love
this one so I'm going to keep three or
three but I'm gonna get rid of two hour
once this one's too pink for me so back
here we have the pixie conceal and tints
I've literally had this for so long and
I've never even tried them so let's see
what they're all about
wow that looks pretty good if I don't
have a tan on I think that'll be fine
then I'm going to swatch the other one
as well oh my god so watery I'm not
keeping this one right here we have
three tart foundations again I only need
one so I'm just going to swatch them and
see what color a would suit well that
looks nice I think I'm going to keep
this one right here in the shade medium
tan honey so I'm going to get rid of the
mac prolongwear concealer and all
through the Australis shade adjust
actually no I'm going to keep that
because my foundations always too - data
oh my god can the plane pork and go away
and to the next one that I have is this
Make Up For Ever HD foundation this one
is what a true darks me unfortunately
I've tried to make a work before which
looks so orange for it sighs I have to
get rid of this one but even with a
really dark say ten is way too yolk for
me I'm going to get rid of this astata
mineral velvet foundation just because
it's really orange like that is not my
color
it's sort of sick oh I found this elf
foundation back here and that's
definitely true last week I'm gonna get
rid of that one and I'm also going to
get rid of one of two of these actually
I'm going to keep these two and I get
rid of this one this month July okay so
the next drawer that we have is Primus
and I'm going to have to leave it at
this because there's literally so much
more to go through or my lipsticks my
eyeshadows and everything so if you guys
do want to see
more than um give this video a thumbs up
but let's move on to the last rule so
I'm going to get rid of this one right
here just because I've never heard the
brand so I'm not sure if anyone can get
a hold of it just / correcting Prime
I've had it for so long
never reach for it so I may get rid of
that this one binary by Nature
I'm gonna get rid of that ones well oh
right so I'm getting rid of my L'Oreal
infallible makeup setting spray just
because I love my urban decay ones and
I'm just going to stick to that I'm also
going to get rid of my Maybelline
setting spray we have this one from it
right cool but I'm going to get rid of
and then I'm also going to get rid of my
Nivea men pro shave balm oh my god is
this crazy this is so I can make sure
makeup sounds forever but I've had it
for a while now I'm not sure if it's
even like good to use on the face
considering it is skincare technically
so yeah I'm narrative that I do have
some a lot of come as an email makeup
down longer anyway um Maitreya this one
from tour as well correcting primals
kissed on user Lauri oh my god my
drawers literally so bad this is kind of
scary
I'm also going to get rid of this skin
perfecting what about this is I
literally want you to get the eye base
from Mac and they gave me this instead
and I paid for it so bye
this is all of the stuff that I just got
rid of there's so much in here how I go
over the way here it's all literally
crazy anyways guys I really hope you

want to see the other pilot figure just
let me know because I'd be very happy to
do that I honestly have some e lipsticks
just sitting up here though I need to go
through because they have so many so
again these are all going to a good
cause I'm not just Chuck in my way
because I feel like it I mean I can do
