my channel so in today's video I have a
massive makeup haul I haven't done a
makeup haul in honestly the longest time
because I don't know if you guys want to
see makeup holes if you do make sure to
give this video a thumbs up so I know to
do more but I just thought since I've
got all of this new makeup I thought
let's just dive in let's just get
started I have a lot of products from
high-end to really really affordable so
we have a big range of different prices
in here
the first thing that I have is the
hourglass vanish foundation they have a
lot of different colors in their range
which I'm really happy about as you can
see here the shade that I'm in is a warm
beige and it is absolutely perfect to my
fake tan I love it so much so as you can
see this is a stick formula I've used it
probably about six times and I have
taken a huge dent out of this foundation
you don't really get that much it is
pretty expensive and I have gone through
it really quickly but it is a really
really beautiful luxurious foundation I
don't really like it for flash
photography because I do feel like it is
a little bit on the Jewish side when I
have like flash photography I do look a
little bit oily around these areas about
here I don't know usually I love doing
foundation but for some reason this just
doesn't look that amazing in photos but
like just for daytime wear it's just
beautiful it leaves really nice like
full coverage just like photoshopped
finish to the face it doesn't feel heavy
and it doesn't have a scent to it which
I love next we have it some glitter eye
shadows or pigments these ones are from
glitter injections I'm sure you guys
have heard a lot about these products
because apparently after three or so
months they mold so quickly I just want
to make a disclaimer I'm not
recommending these products to you
because apparently they do more what a
lot of people have put photos online and
stuff but I have used these before and
okay just look at this like I'm
literally just going to rub it over like
what I'm going to swatch them all so you
guys can see like I've honestly never
seen eyes shadows this pigmented or
glittery and they stick on my eyes so
well they don't budge throughout the
whole night so
guess if you get these you've got to use
them up before the first three months I
don't know I mean that's so beautiful
but it just is such a bummer that that's
the case Oh next I got my hands on the
new makeup geek reformulated blushes
I've never used a product from makeup
geek that I don't love with my whole
heart so I'm super excited to use these
I've used one shade and it was it was
like horribly pigmented like holy crap
so you really want to use a light hand
when you're using these products they
just feel like butter like so smooth on
the face and a lot of these ones are
kind of like pinky at purple coral turns
I really need to get myself a Z palette
so I can put all of these in because
right now I just have the little compact
so the ones I just showed you are in
pants and then these ones are in
compacts this one is so pretty this one
isn't a shade romance it looks like this
it has a really nice golden sheen to it
it's kind of like a coral color I
actually haven't even looked at the
other shades let's see what they look
like holy crap that is very purple this
one is in soulmate and then the last one
that I have here oh that looks like it
goes so many different skin tones
this one is infatuation so I do have
this one but I'm guessing this one is
the reformulated version so I love these
because they're super small and it's
just great for traveling and it's just
sleek and very classy looking makeup
will never disappoint me now next we
have the new Tarte Amazonian clay
highlighter in the shade exposed
highlight I just went on Sephora the
other day to buy a new Beauty Blender
right here because my dog ate my other
one and for some reason this Beauty
Blender is like a darker pink from the
normal ones but it works the same so
it's fine so yeah I saw this and the new
I can just suggest it so I thought I may
as well pick it up this is what it looks
like it's kind of like a very basic
looking pearl champagne highlight it
feels beautiful honestly it feels so
stunning when you swatch it it's very
very buttery and very pigmented it's not
chunky or glittery or anything like that
I feel like it'll just give a nice Sheen
to the face I don't think it'll be
anything over-the-top dramatic but it
will just be like a nice glow you know
what I mean so when I apply this I'm
probably going to put like 100 layers on
to get that pop next I picked up the
Anastasia glow sweets kit I've wanted
for ages ever since it came out and I
got my hands on it on the NSIC website
because turns out they do ship to
Australia which is amazing I just
started thinking I'm getting too excited
I just don't you think he can use PayPal
you have to use like a MasterCard or
something like that so this is what it
looks like it's so beautiful I dropped
this on the ground and the butterscotch
shade shattered so if this goes upside
down it's going to fall out but it's
still kind of intact the shades in here
I think are really really unique we have
like a a nice iridescent whoa it's like
a Goldy pearl color in a different light
so changes color so we have like a yd
pearl color then we have a nice purpley
pink color which is iridescent as well I
think that IRA doesn't then we have like
a copper shade and just a pure gold
which I think are stunning when you
swatch these highlighters you will be
like literally blown away into another
planet because that's how good they are
next we have the moon child glurk here
this one is really really really unique
I've never seen a brand come out with
something like this before
so when I opened it the first time I was
like what this is kinda basic like I
don't really like these colors but when
you swatch them they all change color in
different lights when you move your head
they all change color I have to on my
face right now I don't know if you can
see in this lighting but when I move my
head this way goes purple and then it
goes like a yellowy gold color of
champagne it's just incredible the two
colors that I have on now is blue ice
and Lucky Clover so blue ice actually
isn't blue it is very very like lavender
II purple and then I have Lucky Clover
down here which is more of like an
everyday highlighter that doesn't have
too much purple or anything in it but
these ones look how purple they are I
don't know where I'm gonna wear those
colors but like they're like really
burble ah I love this so much it's just
nice when you come across a makeup
product that is really good because you
get your money's worth and I just love
it the next thing that I have here is
the original RCM a no color powder so
I've heard kathleenlights talking about
this saying it's the best makeup setting
powder ever and I used it today I don't
know like it's really cheap so it
definitely is really really good for its
price but I'm obsessed with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and that is
very luxurious and just it is very
expensive
like it does such an amazing job I feel
like this one did leave a very like big
white cast under my eyes which I
actually do like because I like a
highlighted look under here but it does
say no color powder which is kind of
confusing but um I put it on my nose and
all under here and it kind of took my
foundation off a little bit I'm going to
keep testing it out maybe it was the
foundation that I used or the primer
maybe just didn't work with this powder
but yeah it did
I don't know it grabbed into my
foundation a little bit funny but um so
far it's pretty good especially for its
price and you get a lot of product
the only thing other thing I'm like not
too fond about is like you can't tip it
into a lid I have to put on the back of
my hand and when I'm done I'm just like
cuz come you bother digging a little and
put them back in next thing that I have
here is the L'Oreal infallible Pro spray
and set so here in Australia we don't
have any setup man we don't have any
setting sprays from the drugstore really
especially from L'Oreal or anything like
that so I've got this off beauty joint
and I just got it in the mail today I'm
super excited to try it out I haven't
seen anyone use this ever so I'm excited
to see how it goes because I always use
the Urban Decay Naked urban decay
cooling and hydrating spray that's
really good next thing that I have is
the wet and wild to reflect shimmering
palette in the shade I'll have a Cosmo
so I'm guessing this is a highlight but
it does have pink in it as well so maybe
you could use as like a shimmery blush
at the same time it is humungous it was
very cheap so you're getting a lot for
your money let's see if it's pigmented
because that's always what I like and
any product you guys know that that's
how I describe any product I love flora
pigmented soro buttery
I know I need to come up some new words
but come on mmm not bad actually it does
feel a little bit dry obviously it's not
like a high-end product but it does look
really pretty it is very pink so maybe
this will work better as a blush than a
highlight it is very shimmery though
sort of like ah
I don't know we'll just try it out and
see how it goes but so far I'm impressed
I'm excited I also got this product of
beauty joint as well I've never heard of
it in my life it is called City colour
highlight trio illuminate
so this is what it looks like that
actually looks really really pretty
let's give it a swatch oh yes oh that is
beautiful
yeah girl this was pretty affordable as
well the next thing that I have that
I've had for the longest time but I
haven't spoke about so this is the Chi
majesty a metal matte liquid lipstick so
I've heard a lot of bad stuff about this
product because apparently it comes half
empty I'm going to test it out because I
haven't even really looked at it I can
definitely see a big chunk of the liquid
lipstick like not in there I wouldn't
say it's like a hundred percent full
there's like this much of the product
not in there but um here is really going
to use a whole thing of liquid lipstick
anyway honestly doesn't bother me in the
slightest I'm excited to see how it
swatches so because people are just like
to complain I think it's alright I mean
it's nothing like life-changing but it
definitely is a very unique color I
would just have to say you would need to
layer it up to get a really intense look
but not bad next thing that we have here
is the makeup studio translucent powder
in extra-fine I really really like this
for baking underneath the eyes I like it
nearly just as much as the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I've only used it
once but the first time I use it I was
like this stuff is in credible and I'm
really happy that I'm starting to find
more translucent powders because I feel
like you guys are getting sick of me
using the same one over and over so you
will see me use it a lot in videos
because it is fabulous now we have some
Natasha tuner products which I'm really
excited about because I haven't seen too
many people use her products on YouTube
so I thought well let's bring her into
the YouTube world but maybe I'm just
living under a rock so this is what the
palette looks like it is so stunning and
it's very shiny palette it says Natasha
- no no zero zero zero services anyways
when you open it up this is what it
looks like as you can see I have
definitely how to play with this product
this green though this is what I have on
my lid right now like well it is very
pigmented very creamy and buttery I know
I say that all the time but that is the
perfect way to describe
the Google diet shadows in this palette
the other day when I was using this
green shade I didn't put any glitter
glue under it and it did have a lot of
Fallout on my face but today I used the
Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
on my lid before I applied this screen
there was hardly any fallout and it was
very very glittery and intense as you
can see on my eyes so I would recommend
using a glitter glue with the really
chunky glittery shades like the green
and the blue right here in this color
this color is stunning it's kind of like
a maroon with like green reflexes in it
I work clubbing and it should guys
clothes off I wore it when I went
clubbing the other night and I'm just
obsessed with it so in some lights
maroon some lights it's green oh it's
just so unique I've never seen anything
like that at all so as far as the other
shades go I am very impressed with them
so far I have these two on my eyes right
now and they blend out just as well as
makeup geeks I'm excited to try the
other shades and hopefully get some more
pallets if she even has any not true
sure what she has up her sleeve but I
also have a blush and a highlighter from
her as well so this is what the
highlighter looks like this is what the
highlighter looks like first of all the
packaging she is very talented with her
packaging it just looks very just
gorgeous and girly and luxurious I love
it
so it's good packaging which I love you
give it a swatch oh wow that feels very
very smooth it's very finely milled it's
not chunky at all very very very smooth
so I do feel like this will be very
pretty highlight I can't wait to try it
next thing that I have is the wet and
wild bronzer this has SPF 15 which i
think is pretty cool
so I have the shade ticket to Brazil I
just wanted more drugstore products that
I could use in more drugstore tutorials
people that are on like a smaller budget
and hopefully it's good I have no idea
this is in the most random order ever
but the next thing that I have here is
the Milani conceal plus perfecto and one
foundation and concealer I have the
shade 0/7 and this looks like a really
nice and neutral shade foundation
perfect for when I have a nice dark
fresh fake tan on so if you guys want to
see our first impression on this let me
know otherwise I will just chuck it in a
video and
I'll see how it goes wait where's the
concealer or do you put the foundation
under your eyes as a concealer next
thing that I have is the Natasha De Niro
face glow foundation this has SPF 15 in
it I'm gonna show you dat 30 it is just
like a little pump
I had a wall it smells exactly like the
Mac Studio fluid fix foundation whatever
it is it smells really strong of
sunscreen I'm going to fan of the smell
obviously when you put it on your face
I'm assuming you can't smell any more
the next thing that I have is the
fluidline brow gel cream in the shade a
true brunette by Mac I really like how
this applies on my brows it is very new
see it's a lot more wet of a formula
than the understands your dip brow maybe
just because my understands you one has
dried up but this one I feel is if it is
a lot easier to work with on the brows
and the color is super light but when I
put it on my brows it matches very very
well so very happy with that shape I
have a very large collection of MAC
lipstick especially their new ones I
really just like the formula on my lips
book clubbing I always refer back to
climbing it seems like all I do but
trust me I hardly go clubbing well
that's because I've been sick but
anyways this one is in the shade at
blankety it is a amplified lipstick so
it is a little bit glossy a little bit
shiny the color is studying it is a nude
pink it's something that matches every
single makeup look I would say it is a
bit more pink than nude through you know
what tastes kind of gross all the MAC
lipsticks a bit gross and then the other
Mac product is the lip gloss this is so
so glossy it is the glossiest
lip gloss I've ever tried it's not
sticky but it just looks like you
literally got oil on your lips it's very
very good you get a lot of product as
well 15 mil well I'm never going to use
this in my whole entire lifetime but I
really really really really like this
next I have the L'Oreal Paris infallible
24-hour matte foundation in the shade at
24 golden 3/4 golden beige this color is
so so good it's nice and yellow and
neutral it matches perfectly to me I use
it today so that's what I have on it
right now and I absolutely loved it love
love love this foundation so incredibly
much I was real
shocked with the formula of it it wasn't
too thick it wasn't true runny beautiful
beautiful medium to full coverage you
can definitely build it up and my laugh
lines aren't as bad as normal foundation
usually I get really bad laugh lines
here but so far I'm obsessed with this
foundation I've had it on for about four
hours and what still looks good as new
but I will keep you guys updated and
when I think of this I'm so happy
next we have a full lip glosses these
ones are from Anastasio Beverly Hills I
believe this was like a little holiday
pack that I picked up I thought that was
five glosses mainly I've already lost
the other gloss but these colors are so
pretty especially this one here in the
shade
caramel it's a really nice dark pinky
nude it is very very opaque you don't
even need anything under your lips you
can just put this straight on it just
looks like a straight-up
lipstick with gloss over the tops really
good then we have a pearly kind of what
is this I don't even watch this yet this
one kind of looks like a metal so it's a
pink gloss with a lot of gold reflexes
and it's very stunning I haven't seen
anything like this either it's always
nice to see something a little bit
unique the next color is jelly grape
this is crazy I'm excited to use this
one oh and then last but not least we
have like ireally or I don't know if I'd
wear this this is very pink this is like
very very light pink it is in the shade
blushing but overall I'm very impressed
with these lip glosses I just wanted to
get like a little pack with little size
ones just because I hadn't tried of lip
glosses before I wasn't sure what they
were like but now I'm gonna go buy some
more some more brownie news because
that's my style next we have it some
false lashes I'm sure you guys have
heard me talk about literally lashes
before they are amazing this is one my
favorite brands along with huda beauty
lashes all of these lashes including
huda beauty are pretty pricy around like
$40 but they do lost a lot of wears I
wear mine sometimes up to like 10 times
and they still are in perfect condition
they are very fluttery flirty wispy
looking lashes very full exactly what I
want they have so many different styles
and I'm just very very impressed of the
quality and how long these lashes do
last for Oh
I have so many different styles as well
look how long and wispy these ones are
they're everything I have the Lily
lashes on right now as you can see that
very big
I have hooded eyes as well so I like to
go ahead extra long to cover that saggy
skin this is the product that I also
just got today so I haven't even had
time to play around with it this is the
Milani illuminating a face powder in at0
one so I do have one of these already
but I use it as a blush
let's give it a swatch and see what kind
of color comes up it's kind of like a
neutral brown color you can really see
it I know what you use that for I guess
we'll have to have a play around with in
a makeup tutorial the next thing that I
have is the Wet n Wild mega glow
illuminating a face powder let's give
this one a swatch it doesn't approach
shimmery though I would say this one
looks more like a blush it's definitely
a dark pink so I wouldn't say that's an
illuminating powder the next thing that
I have is the la splash liquid lipsticks
they are called The Velvet Matte so this
is what the packaging looks like I think
this is super cute let's give this
swatch because I haven't watched these
yet let's see oh that was such a bad
swatch I'm so sorry guys I mean isn't
the best liquid lipstick I've ever had
but it is very very cheap because this
is a dark shade it needs to be quite
pigmented otherwise it'll be a bit
patchy and to me that does look a little
bit patchy but maybe when it dries you
can put another layer on maybe it'll be
fine we'll have to wait and see so I
also have another purple shade don't
know why I went all these purples but
see what this looks like oh wow I mean
it does look kind of cute want to see
myself wearing it every day but for
makeup tutorials maybe the next thing
they have is the wet and wild cover or
liquid concealer wand again just want
something more affordable for tutorials
so let's see how this goes and then last
but not least we have the Maybelline
Dream Lumi touch highlighting concealer
in the shade ivory actually I lied we
have well a lot more products but
they're from the one brand it's from the
brand Nabi these are the matte lipsticks
literally these will act two dollars so
I'm like I'm just going to get a bunch
of them and hope that they're good I'm
going to swatch one
and see what the color payoff is like
this is what they look like
let's give them a swatch I would I mean
when you rub it on there a few times it
actually is really pigmented I'm gonna
do one more this one is a really really
dark shade let's see yeah you definitely
definitely need to do like a hundred
swipes for it to be really pigmented but
when it is on it's really on it's
gorgeous this is a gorgeous shade both
of these I'll keep you guys updated on
what I think of those but I hope you
guys enjoyed this makeup hole if you did
please give it a big thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
more videos I love you so much
and I will see you very soon bye
