this makeup look perfect for beginners
and the holiday season so I hope you
guys enjoy and let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing that I'm
taking is this color pop eyeshadow this
is a medium brown I'm just popping this
in my crease just to add a bit more
dimension I'm just going to take a
darker Brown and this one's going in the
socket so I'm not going to bring it as
high as the last shade I'm just going to
take it in windshield wiper motions very
slowly if you guys are looking for some
new blending brushes the cheapest ones I
can think of are from morphe and they
are amazing quality so now it's time for
the lid color I'm taking this beautiful
cream shadow by astrologer this is so
sad because it looks so stunning but it
actually cracks on the eye and gets
really ugly in about 15 minutes of being
on the eye so I wouldn't recommend this
actual one but I will leave a few other
products that look like this but a
better quality down below now let's move
on to the face I'm taking this NYX
primer I use this all the time it is so
affordable so I'm just going to buff
this all over my face with a little
brush just because I don't want my
foundation going anywhere throughout the
day so for the foundation I'm taking
this one from Maybelline I will leave
all the products that I'm using in the
description below if you guys are
interested I like this foundation
because it doesn't look too cakey but it
definitely does add a lot of coverage if
you're going to put on as much as me so
I just blended this in with a brush and
then I went in over the top with a
Beauty Blender to make sure there's no
harsh lines left I'm using the Rimmel
match perfection concealer in the shade
60 under my eyes this is just going to
get rid of any purple or blue tones
under there so just blending that out
with a Beauty Blender once again and
then we're just going to go ahead and
set that down with the Rimmel
translucent powder this is going to make
sure that the concealer stays in place
all day long so I'm just going to let
that bake for a few minutes in the
meantime I'm just going to take the
Australis of fresh and flawless pressed
powder and I'm just going to pack this
all over my face just to add a little
bit of extra coverage and also to make
sure it does not budge now I'm taking
this yellow shade from the next
highlight and contour pro palette and
I'm just going to
is right under my eyes when you're doing
this be careful not to rub away and your
concealer you just want to lightly pack
be very gentle and now I'm going in with
the covergirl the super sizer mascara
and just coating my top and bottom
lashes
I'm just taking this from side to side
so it really gets in all of my little
lash crevices and then just taking that
same a dark crease color I'm just going
to run that from the outer corner to the
inner corner for a little bit of color
under there and this is when I realized
that the Australis product was cracking
on my eyelid and it looked horrible and
flaky so I just went over the top with a
rose gold eyeshadow it didn't completely
fix it but it definitely did the job now
going in with some lashes these are just
true doll lashes from eBay I think it's
like la girl or something I'll try and
find them and link them down below for
you guys but they're really easy to
apply because the band is so thin so now
moving on to contour I'm just gonna take
a medium brown shade and pop this under
my cheekbones to make them look really
defined and sharp then I'm taking a
bronzer on a really fluffy brush this
one isn't shimmery at all it's just a
nice match to add a bit of warmth to the
face make it look like we went outside
and got some Sun but really we didn't
honey then taking that same yellow
banana shade I'm just going to put this
under where I contoured and put the
bronzing shade just because I did bring
it down a little bit too far so this is
going to really clean it up and it takes
two seconds now it's time to add a bit
of glow to the face so I'm taking this
highlighter by wet-and-wild and I'm just
going to use this as a blush to add a
nice sheen on the cheeks and then for
the actual highlighter I'm going in with
the mary lou manizer by the balm this is
stunning and so pigmented so I just put
this above my cheekbones and also on the
center of my nose and look at that glow
is stunning now I'm just going to go in
with the la splash liquid lipstick this
stuff is very very drying on the lips
but it does look so incredible I
definitely think it's worth it for the
price I'm pretty sure these are like 6
bucks or something the colors are
phenomenal the only thing that I don't
like is the lips feel a bit tight and
they stink a little bit by this one
stunning now I'm just going to go in
with a little bit of blush on my cheeks
because I feel like we needed a little
bit of a pop of color because my face
was a tiny bit washed out so just
that right on the apples and then
blending it back and then I'm just going
to finish it off with a bit of a
mary-lou manizer on the inner corners
and then we are done I really hope you
