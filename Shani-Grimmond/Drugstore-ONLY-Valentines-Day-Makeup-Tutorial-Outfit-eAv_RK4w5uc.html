doing well
so let's go ahead and jump into the
makeup so I'm going to start with my
brows and I'm just taking my chichi brow
pomade and going in and filling them in
so I start by drawing a line directly
under my brow and then I drew a line on
the top of my brow and make them a
little bit higher and more defined and
then I go into the front with whatever
is left on the brush and let me dust my
brows upwards and then I'll be taking my
la girl Pro conceal high definition
concealer and I'm just going to carve
out my brows underneath so just using a
flat brush and getting as close as I can
to those brows and making them super
defined so I'm also going to use that
concealer to cover up all those veins on
my eyelid and of course once I've done
that I go in with my Rimmel stay matte
powder to set that concealer down
otherwise the concealer is going to get
stuck to it now for the eyeshadow I'm
taking the a chichi palette this one is
massive so I'm going to start with this
a medium brown shade and this was so
incredibly pigmented I was really
impressed with this so of course this is
just going to be my transition shade so
going from outer corner to inner corner
and blowing it up quite high so we can
have some nice warmth in there and of
course I'm taking another warm shader
for my crease and this is going closer
to the crease I'm not going to bring
this one up as high and of course I'll
just take a fluffier brush when I'm done
with a smaller brush and just fluff it
upwards so it's nice and blown out and
then for the crease shade I'm going to
take this really pretty pinky peach
shade and I just spray my brush with
some mac fix+ because I really wanted it
to be intense but you can use a
drugstore one of course
so just packing this on it was very
pretty and shimmery so now for mascara
I'm going to take the covergirl these
super sizer mascara hurt my lashes and
by the way Michael did a little wing to
me I honestly
do wings at all so he tracks do it and
my eye shape doesn't really work for
wings so it looks pretty average anyway
so let's move on to the face next I'll
be taking this elf illuminating face
primer and I'm just popping this on all
over out my face to be stood of glowy
and this have like a really nice gold
Sheen to it it is very pretty but you
can tell it's cheap because it takes a
while to blend out because it's so thick
for the foundation today I'm using the
Maybelline matte and poreless the brush
that I'm using to apply it is so
incredible it's from the what you've oh
it's just a buffing brush it makes any
foundation look so flawless I'm
completely obsessed with it you guys
should check out those with brushes I'm
likely living to them but um yeah pretty
pricey and we are doing a drugstore
makeup tutorial I'm here making this
foundation a medium to full coverage so
it can be nice and glam so now for the
concealer I'm taking that same la girl
Pro conceal and just brightening up
under my eyes and also down the center
of my face I'm not a massive fan of this
concealer just because it leaves little
grains on my face maybe I have a dud
because Michael was saying that he had
that with his old one but not would use
new concealer so I'm going to try it out
again get some new ones so to set that
down and taking the Rimmel match
perfection translucent powder and it's
going to bake underneath my eyes so that
concealer does not move throughout the
day and then to set the rest of the face
I'm just going to take a press powder
and pack it all over my face I always
like my face to be super matte so I
don't understand the purpose of meeting
like an illuminating primer and I feel
like it kind of perks through a little
bit but not really now it's time for the
lower lash line so I'm going to take
this warm brown shade and pull it from
outer corner to inner corner to smoke it
out just a little bit and then it's time
for contouring so I'm taking this one at
from its sleek and of course I'll just
pick up the three Brown shades from this
little palette I absolutely adore this
it works so well the color is really
nice for my skin tone as well so the
brush that I'm using is from Real
Techniques it is perfect for contouring
I love it love it so I'm just going
under my cheekbones and also on my jaw
burn as well so now for the runs are I'm
taking this one from Milani and just
using a really big fluffy brush and
going in and my cheekbones jaw Brown and
also around my hairline as well to give
that forerun the effect
let's go in and add some pink to the
cheeks so I'm taking this blush from
Milani and I just wanted to look nice
and girly so I just overloaded it and it
looks so pretty now for highlight I'm
taking these three shades from the
chichi pellet it's not like over-the-top
intense but it does add a nice glow to
the cheek so just on my cheekbones on my
nerves and also on my Cupid's bow for a
little glow and then we can go in and
clean up that bronze up so I'm taking
the Rimmel stay matte powder again just
on a little brush and dragging that
under my bronzer to clean it up and it
make it look like I didn't drag it down
oh my bad so just quickly I'm going to
highlight my inner corner with the same
highlight shades just because I felt
like it needed a little bit of the
shimmer in there so now moving on to the
lips and taking this pretty rose color
from the balm at this one is a liquid
lipsticks or just going in and filling
my lips in this little that six smells
like mint it's kind of like really nice
because if you do have bad breath it's
like a
jerax I don't have bad breath because I
have minty lips Starlin anyways you guys
know I do an ombre lip in nearly every
single makeup tutorial so I'm taking
this a lipstick from colour-pop I
absolutely love these and I'm just going
to put this on the center of my lips and
then I'm taking this Rimmel
oh my gloss lip gloss and going all the
way over the top of the lips and this
made a lips look so juicy this one is a
must if you like the leave big duty
coffee lips yes so here we have the
finished makeup look I love how it
turned out so now let's move on to the
outfit because I think it was like the
perfect fit for Valentine's Day since
nothing's going so this jumpsuit is from
hello Molly fashion I will leave
everything down below in the description
box anyway if you guys are interested
but it is a really pretty pinky purple
sparkly it jumpsuit it's so cute and
then we have some nude strappy heels as
well so the bags that I'm wearing is
from YSL I just got this it is
absolutely beautiful so here we have the
finished look I really hope you guys
like it and I hope you have an amazing
Valentine's Day I would definitely have
more videos very soon with more dramatic
looks you know what I mean okay girl I
