today's video I'm doing a one-round
makeup tutorial using only covergirl I
love doing these videos because it's
always nice to try out new products and
also use products that are super
affordable so this makeup look is super
bold because it's inspired by Katy Perry
because she has collaborated with
covergirl with her new Katy cap
collection which is actually launching
in April 2017 so I hope you guys like
this makeup look and let me show you
what products that I'm using so once
i've primed my eyelids i'm going to go
in and move onto the eyeshadows so i'm
going to take the trublend bronzer and
this is going to work as the transition
so just taking a really big blending
brush and buffing that from outer corner
to inner corner and making sure it is
really soft and blown out then I'm
taking this eyeshadow quad in
breathtaking blues and I'm picking up
this beautiful greeny blue color and
just packing it all over my lid with a
flat shader brush I'm also going to
blend around the edges to make sure it
is nice and seamless and there's no
harsh lines and then I'm going to take
the latter shade from that palette and
I'm just going to use this to highlight
underneath my eyebrow and then that we
can move on to the space I'm just going
to take the outlast all-day primer and
I'm just going to buff this into my skin
that with the buffing brush this feels
super moisturizing and we want to make
sure that the primer stays on all day
long now it's time for the foundations
I'm taking this a Ready Set gorgeous a
fresh complexion foundation and this
one's in the shade at 210 serve with
that same buffing brush I'm just going
to buff this in circular motions all
over my face so this foundation was like
a light to medium coverage and I wanted
a little bit more extra coverage so I
just went in with one more layer and
then we are ready to go so now it's time
for concealer I'm taking the Ready Set
gorgeous concealer and I'm just going to
take a lot of shade than my foundation
to make sure under the eyes is nice and
highlighted and of course you guys know
the drill we've taken that Beauty
Blender and I'm going to bounce away now
I'm just going to go in with this clean
normal skin pressed powder and I have a
lot of shade here so I can keep under
the eyes nice and highlighted so I'm
just taking that on a really small brush
and I'm just going to pack that under
there so we have no creasing at all and
I also took it down my nose to keep that
area highlighted
as well now it's time for the lower lash
line I'm taking the liquid liner blast
eyeliner in a shade blue bloom it is so
pretty and pigmented I'm just going to
line my waterline and also take it down
a little bit further so we really have a
massive pop of blue so of course I'm
just going to blend that out with a
little brush so it is nice and smoothed
down I'm just going to pick up this
beautiful light blue color and just
packing that down on a little pencil
brush now it's time for the mascara this
one is the katie-cat mascara and I
noticed that it does an amazing job at
really curling the lashes and lifting
them up and that's because the sculpting
brush is at 360 degrees so it allows you
to have the ultimate cat eye to make
this look even more blue I added a blue
mascara on my lower lashes which I've
never done before and I thought it
looked so cool
I'm loving this okay so let's move on to
the bronzer I'm just going to use that
same one that I put in my crease and I'm
just going to bronze up my face you guys
know the drill I love a shimmery bronzer
and this was so Chloe so putting this on
my cheekbones and of course around my
forehead and on my jaw line so for the
blush today I'm taking this true blend
in a shade at 200 again I love anything
that's really shimmery on the cheeks and
this was so pretty and glowy
so just popping that on the apples of my
cheeks and then blending it back then we
can move on to the highlighter so I just
took a really light shimmery shade from
that same palette the one that I used to
highlight underneath my eyebrow and let
me just tell you I didn't have a
highlight but I don't think I needed a
highlight because oh it's still glowing
with an eye shadow and that is how you
do it now it's time for the lips so I'm
taking this katie-cat a matte lipstick
this one is a demi matte formula so it's
really moisturizing but it's still very
very pigmented so I will leave the
shades of all the products I'm using
down below if you guys are interested
but these lipsticks are 1795 Australian
if you guys are interested I think
that's super pretty and I decided to go
with like a light pink so it would
really work with the blue eyeshadow so
just quickly I wanted to show you guys
the Katie cat collection lipsticks I'm
going to swatch all of them for you guys
now we have everything from pinks
purples oranges reds blacks everything
so make sure you guys let me know down
below what color is your
favorite so I hope you guys enjoy this
makeup tutorial if you did please give
it a big thumbs up and I will see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
