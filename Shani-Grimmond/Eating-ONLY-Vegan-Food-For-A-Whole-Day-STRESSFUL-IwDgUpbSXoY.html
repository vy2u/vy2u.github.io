channel so in today's here I am gonna go
begin that for the day okay so I feel
like this is gonna open a massive jar of
worms because oh my runs gonna tell me
to go vegan after this video uhm I'm
scared I'm actually really scared so
we're gonna go buy some groceries and
I'm gonna cook everything um I mean I
could order things in but I thought it'd
be a better experience to cook
everything okay so obviously you guys
know that being a vegan is not using or
consuming any animal products so I've
just gone ahead and googled pros and
cons of being a vegan so some of the
advantages over they can diet it says
may help lower cholesterol may help
lower blood pressure increases
antioxidant intake it helps reduce the
risk of type 2 diabetes heart attacks
strokes obesity some cancers so there's
a lot a lot a lot of pros disadvantages
of a vegan diet a radical change I don't
see how that's a disadvantage at all
difficulty when dining out I mean I do
have a vegan friend and it definitely
was a lot harder for her to eat out but
you can obviously just choose
restaurants that have vegan options and
then you don't have a problem so I don't
think that's really I mean you have less
options that's for sure I feel like this
is a really touchy subject for a lot of
people what people consume so it's going
to be interesting and try to just relax
in the comments this is just something
that I want to do and I just want to see
how I feel at the end of the day if I
feel a lot better because I know what I
ain't meat sometimes I do feel really
sick and I'm I'm not I know I know a lot
of people will have different opinions
on this but I don't think that humans
were designed to eat me I mean I still
do so I can't really I can't really say
that but it just like I understand why
people go vegan a hundred a hundred
percent I have so much respect for them
because
I could imagine it would be really hard
so yeah that's pretty much all I have to
say just relax don't take this video too
seriously I'm just experimenting I just
want to see if I feel better and how hot
it is so let's go shopping by the way it
is seven o'clock in the morning so yeah
hopefully closes or anything so let's go
okay guys sir I've narrowed it down we
have the tomato and basil bruschetta if
like that would be good for breakfast
and then this juice I feel like would be
nice with it and then I have like all of
these other options here that I'm just
gonna have on the side like I can choose
from all right let's do this
oh I've got washing in there that
was stressful all right
I only dropped the can of tomatoes
brother okay so my first thought of
going shopping for all of this vegan
food was I guess because I'm not used to
it it detect a long time I couldn't find
anything I've never bought Hegel in my
last like crazy I know but Kaelyn my
life like I couldn't find the right
bread I was looking at like the back of
like all these biscuits so I could put
hummus on it and excuse me if any of
these products aren't vegan i honestly
try my best but like i was reading the
back of all of the ingredients and it
was like this may contain milk or egg
and I'm like cool do you want do not
contain milk or egg because I need to
know because I can't eat it okay and
also when I was going through all of the
recipes I kind of chose things that I
would generally eat so if I was to ever
go be you know a vegetarian or whatever
at least then I will kind of have an
idea of what I like to eat stuff
surrogate or free all mushrooms
oh okay sir we have my tomato here you
guys are literally gonna kill me for the
way I cut like tomatoes or anything
because I literally just don't care
like I mean update the days it's gonna
be in my belly into smithereens so like
I just don't care I still like it or not
how expensive all this stuff was just
three bags of groceries
that's just an odor okay the next thing
that we have is garlic cloves
hello does that mean that garlic is dead
I'm just gonna take the light pop cuz
that's to be googy that's don't need
much garlic anyway
come on I remember I did hospitality and
every time I caught up with my fingers
would stink for like a week chives and
I'm also gonna put some solder oh my god
you guys have no idea how hot it was to
find bread that didn't have like a meal
couple egg in it impossible
well it's impossible okay so I'm just
gonna put this in the oven yeah okay so
I'm just gonna go in with a little bit
of extra virgin olive oil
oh my god I'm just in it just a little
bit folks on us dry oh my god I'm so
hungry
mmm mmm that's so good
I'm gonna run I mean a rush well lots of
likely about I'll see you guys next it's
been a few hours now and I'm still not
hungry for some reason usually I'd be
eating by now cuz it's 12 o'clock it's
like time for lunch but because I'm not
hungry
I'm gonna make myself eat something a
little because I do have to work for the
next two hours and sorry so I'm gonna
make a juice I'm so excited this cuz it
way still so refreshed so you have
celery lemon spinach apple pineapple and
kale I've never tried kale ever in my
life that's gonna be interesting and
also a big chunk of ginger it's a really
good for you so we have my juice get my
juicer here so I'm just gonna start
shoving everything in there cheese I'm
gonna be all sugared out after this but
at least it's not sugar
guys can I just say something really
important I literally forgot to mention
that the biggest pro of being a vegan is
obviously not killing animals or harming
them in any way
I don't know why I did much that that
started completely furball
let me say that's like the most
important thing
that's why spurts to cut it fast and I'm
just lazy
oh ok it's ready
Janka huh I feel like so many people
will be able to relate to this like when
you try to eat healthy like oh no trap I
think it's the kale it's kind of better
how you're Jason pineapple it's really
not that bad I'm just being dramatic
so I just got nice a light bulb on the
ground I don't know if like helps a
vegan but I'm about to giggle and if
it's when I'm gonna be really upset cuz
I just want it
it says mercy my lollipops ah stay with
the vegetarians yuck I don't even wanna
know what's in that guess you got a
haircut my little bubbly oh wow guess
what guys I'm going vegan for the day
yeah be proud of Mommy oh now I'm gonna
make myself a soup this one is called
spicy black bean and corn soup with
chili so I'm going to add a few of my
own ingredients but it's just when I got
off taste I always leave it true late
and I'm like already so hungry so we
have celery sweet potato corn capsicum
tomato paste garlic black beans
red onion pine nuts and a pasta okay so
the first thing it says is to add black
beans into the saucepan I don't even
like celery
maybe this is what tasted really gross
this morning in that drink
and then I'm just gonna go with some
chunky garlic paste
I like originally was first to do like
fresh garlic I love garlic just keep
that in mind
great um but my thing is smellin na+
summer and oh my god guys are literally
just read the recipe and it says put all
the ingredients in a slow cooker for
seven hours hon Iran they got thirty
minutes not even that I don't care I'm
just gonna sit Larry my welp I'm using
like the biggest snuff you can get for
this like a little job does that get
some other taste
I literally just thought to myself oh my
god this would taste so much he's on it
Jerry setting vegan okay lastly I'm
announcing my notes say it back really
love them so much alright please okay
sir I'm about to try it it kind of just
like spaghetti bolognaise but instead of
meat it's got beans in it I literally go
away I love pasta
mm come over the pine not just sharpen
usually I would eat this with me and
your client tastes like it's missing
something but like I'm glad that I'm not
eating me sir I just read the back of
the roasted salted cashew nuts and it
says may contain traces of eggs gluten
milk peanuts sesame seeds sweetly why
like what do you mean Mei what does that
mean does it mean it's like it's like
these are made at a factory where
there's like egg and milk and there
could possibly be that's like people in
there that are allergic but that not
it's not actually in it I think that's
what it is
remember it anyway so instead I'm gonna
have a Punnett almost roll brace oh my
god stories my favorite I'm not gonna
lie there I really really do feel good
actually I think I'm full I can't figure
out how I'm feeling just because I don't
eat this type of food all the time like
usually I literally eat eggs every
morning for breakfast and then I eat a
chicken wrap for lunch and then I eat
steak for dinner or something oh my god
you guys gonna be surfers out it has
been a few hours now I am leaving it is
time for dinner sir I wish they don't
have anything left that's vegan in my
fridge and I refused to have that pasta
stuff again because I'm just not feeling
it it just didn't just didn't work for
me but so Monica rates right now and I
just typed in the vegan and the first
thing that popped up was if veganism
pizzeria so I'm gonna order a super
supreme pizza with like vegan ham egg
and cheese all that stuff so I feel like
that'll be really cool to test that out
and then I go to sprite a cart and Kelly
said that
the coke isn't a vegan is it Megan I'm
pretty sure coke is vegan I'll be
feeling there's something I might have
done a speech ever it says you should
know that a few of our drinks do contain
small traces of fish and gelatin does
that maybe gelatin Spig feet feet pig
hoofs brand up people that's really
disgusting okay so that's pretty just
arrived I'm here with Kelly and the tree
dopes because they obviously want to
join in but this is what it looks like
it's really small there's glue looks
good looks good this was $16 I mean it
looks good it kind of smells like dog
food mm-hmm being what do you reckon Ben
do you like it yeah she does her nurse
is going oh I'm so scared
that's good mm-hmm
yeah also it was different you know I
better take it take a big chunk of for
making him and cheese mm-hmm what guy
how do they make the hand is it beans
smashed together beans it looks like ham
I don't no idea not serious I think that
I think that's hella it's like tofu II
it doesn't taste anything like hammer
nine it's very powdery you got a bit of
vegan on you - I like it not pepper i
needa don't like dirty shoes yeah no
it's just bland it's just like wet
cardboard that's all that we were eating
I mean it was a riot at at an odd
probably guy for I'm very like six but I
dated again if I was a vegan if it what
if it was the last thing I had to eat
it's definitely be I would have happily
ate it yeah I mean I had to choose
No well obviously there's better vegan
food in the world than that and maybe I
just don't like vegan ham and all of
that or maybe just not that kind so I
will train more so I do feel really good
for my eating meat or like animal
products I feel like I'd have to be
doing this for like a good week if I
really want to see how my boy reacted I
don't feel like yucky and my stomach at
all which is good because if you wait
too much if you ate a lot of meat do you
feel domestic yes yeah honestly don't
think that we're designed to eat me
interesting I feel like I look I learned
a lot in this video today but if you
guys want me to do another one of these
videos then let me know and I could
maybe like go eat out and stuff and just
like see how hot it is to eat out so
give this video a thumbs up again I have
a lot of respect people that are vegan I
feel like it is a little bit harder than
not being vegan but obviously it's for a
lot of good causes so kudos to you I
enjoyed being the in for the day sir I
love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video
say bye kids come on give this video a
thumbs up please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
