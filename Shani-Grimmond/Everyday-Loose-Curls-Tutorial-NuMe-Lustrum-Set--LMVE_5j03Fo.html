today's video is going to be a really
really simple hair tutorial anyone can
do this and I was actually inspired by
Khloe Kardashian she has been having
some amazing hairstyles lately so I went
ahead and created these at loose kind of
curly waves that have a lot of volume so
I'm so excited to be doing this video
because I finally got my hands on the
nume lustrum curling set wand and I do
have some coupon codes and I will share
them with you guys later so make sure
you stay tuned and I will be doing a
review on this as well because a lot of
people have been asking me to do review
so here I am at doing one for you guys
and I hope you guys like this video and
let's jump into it this is what the nume
lustrum set looks like it is basically a
five interchangeable curling wand so you
have the head and then you have five
different heat barrels to go on top so
you have a huge selection for when
you're traveling and it is very
compacted so very travel friendly so
this is the head that all of the barrels
clip into and then i'm using the 32
millimeter
there's also the 25 and the 19 the pearl
and also the reverse and of course a
glove so you don't burn your hand
okay so first things first I'll be
taking my John Frieda dry shampoo and
this just adds volume to my hair as well
as making it look nice and fresh so my
hair is two days old because I wanted
the curls to last extra long and then
I'm going ahead and taking a wide
toothed comb and just parting my hair
down the center and then to part my hair
off to curl it I'm just going to be
going from under my ears and then
clipping it up I'm just going ahead and
clipping the 32 millimeter barrel onto
the wand and then of course adding my
glove because I do not want to burn
myself at all and then I'm just going to
be parting that section off in the
middle just so I have a nice piece of
hair to work with I just like to take
random chunks it doesn't really matter
and then I like to wrap my arm around
the back of my head just so I can curl
the curls away from my face I leave it
in for about 10 seconds and then just
catch the curls and yes I did change my
top because I thought my hair was
clashing with he black but it wasn't
really
now it's time to part off my hair again
so this time I'm going to be parting it
from the top of my ears and then
clipping it up and the same procedure
goes I just take a random piece of hair
probably about 1 inch and then I just do
the same thing wrap my arm around the
back of my head and curl it away from my
face so the main reason as to why I love
this curling one so much is because it
doesn't leave my hair feeling really dry
and the reason to that is because the
barrel is actually made with tall baleen
I don't want to get too technical but
basically it just balances out the
moisture on your hair so it just leaves
looking really shiny and healthy and I
just love the finish that it leaves and
again I'm just going to be parting my
hair about two inches upwards to my last
pot and when I wrap the hair around the
barrel I'm making sure to keep it quite
firm and yeah the reason why apart my
hair is just so I don't miss any strings
because obviously I don't want any
straight bits
okay so now I'm going to start curling
the last section of hair and I like to
start from the back and then work my way
forward to the fringe no particular way
on doing it again are just curling it
away from my face holding it for about
10 to 15 seconds and then letting it
drop into my hand just to make sure that
the curl really stays there and voila
I swear my camera always cuts out of the
worst time it was gonna be the grand
finale of the last string of hair but
anyways now I'm just gonna be running my
fingers through my hair just to mess it
up a little bit and you know just loosen
the curls it just looks so stunning when
you do that you can even brush it out a
little bit if you'd like so now to add
some more volume to the hair I'm taking
some root volumizer I'm not quite sure
what it's called but I will have it
listed down below so I just rubbed it in
between my fingers and then puffed it up
into my roots and now I'm just gonna be
taking some argan oil buy a new me and
just rubbing that in the tips of my
fingers and then rubbing it from the
middle of my hair downwards to the end
and then for some hairspray I'm just
going to be spraying at my whole hair to
make sure the curls stay in all day and
I nearly forgot to mention that the
curls look even better the next day once
you've slept on them so now for some
coupon codes so my first coupon code is
