channel so in today's video I'm doing an
updated 2017 everyday makeup tutorial so
for the past like few weeks over the
holidays I haven't been wearing much
makeup at all just because I can't be
bothered a lot of the times I don't wear
makeup but this is for the times I
really want to pull myself together
without doing like a big eye shadow look
and lipstick and lashes and all of that
so this is definitely not a no makeup
makeup look it's a lot of makeup but
it's not like as much as I do in my
other tutorials so before I get started
I have a really big announcement I'm
engaged I'm kidding
I'm just kidding this is actually my
right hand because I think the video
switched around flipped her out I'm not
sure but look how pretty this ring is I
bought it for myself actually um and I
actually lost it last week and Jonathan
found it so I'm really happy it's back
so you know anyways let's go ahead and
jump into this makeup look the first
thing that I do before I apply makeup
all the time is going with my
moisturizer so I've gone back to this
one this is the simple kind of skin
light moisturizing lotion I've gone
through so many other moisturizers that
are just really expensive and I'm like
you know what this does just as well as
a job as all my expensive moisturizers
so I'm just back on this one I've been
using this for so many years it's not
even funny
and then for primer I'm going to take
the Too Faced hangover primer this one
is super moisturizing so it works
perfectly for my skin because I have
really dry skin so I'm just going to put
a few pumps on a little stippling brush
and work this into my skin oh it smells
really good as well it's like coconut e
you know what I am so happy that it is
2017 right now I hope you guys are
feeling motivated this is the perfect
that looks like a book I like what do
you mean this is the perfect time to
just get into everything that you've
been wanting to do but you haven't
started like I really want to start the
gym I feel like when I go to the gym I
have more energy and I just feel like so
much more alive and what else do I want
to do I really want to feel more I want
to start a few more things with my HD
the label I'm traveling a lot this year
which I'm talking about I think I'm
going to start doing this every time I
do my makeup because everyone seems to
be complain
about my laugh lines here and Lamy got
to toy I think I'm so sorry I have skin
I'm so sorry
no but seriously I'm hoping this will
work this is the benefit Porefessional
I'm just going to use theirs and hope
that it like kind of fills in these
laugh lines a little bit cuz my not like
rank if you know what I mean like it's
really intense
I don't really have many pores in this
area but I'm just gonna put a tiny bit
there anyway well it's out now it's time
for the base so I'm going in with my
foundation as you guys know I always
have a super dark net because I faked
henna religiously literally every single
week you'll never see me with no effect
in any way so I'm using the Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation this is
in the shade medium tan sand so this one
has a little dropper first I'm just
gonna shake it up and I'm just gonna
drop it onto my face I'm just gonna do
one side at a time I really like this
foundation because it's super thin it
doesn't feel thick on the face at all
but it really just matches my neck to my
face and adds a really nice like
flawless but not cakey finish to the
skin
I've just been obsessed with it and I
always apply this foundation with a
beauty I don't want with a brush because
if I use a Beauty Blender it goes super
patchy so this is the best way to apply
it isn't it so satisfying to watch me
match up my face to my neck because I
love it so much I always have to let go
of my nose a thousand times because
nothing ever sticks to it now it's time
to cancel out the discoloration
underneath my eyes so the concealer I've
been using a lot lately is the Smashbox
Studios skin 24-hour waterproof
concealer in the shade at light/medium
I have a million concealers but for some
reason I always go back to this one so
this concealer isn't too much lighter
than my foundation um no I just feel
like for an everyday look I don't really
like to highlight under the eyes as much
for my concealer I always go in with my
Beauty Blender
it is incredible so I just like to
bounce around the eye area and it just
covers everything stunning with
whatever's left on my Beauty Blender
I'll just go over my eye
I have a million bags under there let's
go ahead and set underneath the eyes so
I'm taking big Kat Von D shade and a lap
palette and as you can see I really do
love this middle shade because I've hit
pan I'm just going to take this brush
here it is the morphe g37 and I just
like to pack this banana shade it
directly under my eyes usually I bake
under my eyes but you know what new year
new me
I'm not baking on an everyday basis
because it's just so messy the powder
just goes everywhere and this is so easy
and it takes two seconds and then to set
the rest of my face I'm going in with my
hello flawless powder by benefit in the
shade of honey I've been using this for
so many years now and I haven't even hit
pan I don't know how the brush I'm going
to use to apply and that is the more
fear G for this is really dense so it's
just going to pack it on it's exactly
what I want so I'm just going to dab it
so the foundation doesn't move if I
don't set my face I feel like the
bronzer and everything that I put on top
just go super patchy so I always do this
step let's go ahead and fill these brows
in because they're just like really
pissing me off so let's just get it over
and done with I'm going to go in with
this Anastasia brow powder duo in the
shade soft brown so I like to use this
dark brown shade right here and just go
in fill them in make them a little bit
darker and longer so usually I use like
a dip brow pomade to fill my brows in
when I have heavier makeup but because
this makeup is kind of like a light I
don't want my brows to be like the main
focus I want them to look kind of
natural and stuff so I'm just going to
take an angled brush and go on in I need
a mirror or really close to my face I
was I don't know what's happening so I'm
just going to start from the tail of my
brow and just draw a little strokes so
once I've made the tail of my brow
longer I like to make my arch a little
bit higher so my brows on is straight
and then I fill in the top to just draw
a line straight above my brows and then
I take the powder directly underneath my
eyebrow to straighten the bottom out a
little bit just so it's not as you know
like that because that's what it
actually looks like now for the lashes
I'm going to go in with the Mac
extended play gigablack lash I always
change out my mascaras I don't always
use this one but this is what I'm going
to use today so just starting from the
roots of my lashes and just moving it
side to side now time for my lower
lashes I never miss these little babies
I'm just going to go over my other
mascara with this one from Urban Decay
it is the provisional scar so I'm just
going to coat the tips of my lashes to
make them a little bit thicker oh my god
this combo is amazing my lashes look
like little spider legs and then for
bronzer I'm going in with this Marc
Jacobs Omega bronze in one or two
Titantic no turn trick my bad it looks
like this it is freaking humongous oh my
god my tan why does ten always go so bad
around the hands first like it's so
annoying I never brush that I like to
use is the morphe m40 3 this is amazing
for bronzer so I'm just going to dip
that in and put this on my cheekbones
this is a beautiful bronzer it's not
shimmery but it is like a really nice
bronzy shade if I ever want a bit of a
bronzy glow to my cheekbones I like to
go in with the matte gold deposit this
is absolutely stunning look at the color
of that so I only take a tiny bit
because this honestly has like so much
sugar in it I just like to put that
directly on top of my bronzer oh yeah
this is only for dads why I'm really
like feeling a lot of makeup usually I
just do um like bronzer on its own now
that we've moved on from that really
excessive part I'm so sorry now let's
move on to blush so this one is from
essence I love the essence blushes
they're so affordable and they look
amazing on the cheeks so this one is in
the shade at 10 satin coral I'm just
going to take this angled brush from Mac
it is the 168 and I'm just going to tap
this in lightly tap off the excess
because I don't like too much blush I
just like a little flush of color I'm
just going to work this in circular
motions on my cheekbones and then blend
it back
so it all ties in together well that's
so big mminton I really went overboard
with my bronzer on this side Oh
now it's time to make the face glow a
little bit so this highlighter is from
Oprah and it is called Beverly Hills is
so stunning I've been using this
religiously lately so I like to mix all
of these shades together like the
champagne pink and the pale shade the
brush that I'm using is the morphe M
five-10 so I went to multi when I was in
America and picked up like a million
brushes and they're incredible so I'm
just going to put this on the top of my
cheekbones and then take it in circular
motions and just blend it in you don't
even need fixed plus with this
highlighter like that's how intense it
is so you can see my bad I'm also just
going to take this on the tip of my nose
now time for the lips I'm going in with
this Too Faced lip liner in the shade at
perfect nude and I'm just going to line
my top lip a little bit to give it more
shape because my lips are looking a
little bit invisible then I'll just take
a little bit on my bottom lip I never
usually use any lipstick on like a
day-to-day basis just because I feel
like it's so irritating on the lips when
I'm eating it just comes straight off no
matter what brand it is so I usually
just go in with lip gloss this one is
the liner lips 101 appointment it is
really glossy and it hydrates the lips
at the same time so it's like a
two-in-one
now it's time to set the face I'm taking
the Urban Decay at chill makeup setting
spray in cooling and hydrating so I like
to use this one on more of like an
everyday basis and when I want a really
dramatic makeup look I like to use this
in long-lasting to keep my makeup really
look lockdown but I feel like this one
just adds a little bit of a glow to the
face so that's what I like for my dry
skin so I'm just grated everywhere oh my
god I literally just inhaled that
okay I'm just going to look straight
ahead while it's drying because if you
look I pull down the mascara which went
twist knit missed the mascara will
transfer onto your skin so just let it
dry for a second now that I have my
bowling bling on I ready to go not that
I'm going anywhere but I hope you guys
like this makeup look
I definitely don't wear this every
single day as like every single person
says in these everyday makeup looks but
what I do want to pull myself together
make myself look nice and cute this is
what I like to do I did go a bit
overboard with the bronzer so sorry but
overall I'm really happy with how the
look turned out if you like this video
