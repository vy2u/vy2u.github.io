to my channel so in today's video I'm
doing my everyday makeup look I haven't
done one of these in a really long time
so I thought it was about time I updated
you guys with different products that I
use and different ways I apply them and
stuff so this is just four times I go
shopping or to the movies or anything
kind of casual like that if I can even
be bothered putting on makeup
and another thing that I want to like
address is the fact that I completely
chipped off this tooth so it might look
a bit webside where I'm smiling I'm
getting my porcelain veneers soon so
that'll be a little sorted but yeah just
what I'd whip it out because I feel
really weird with missing tooth anyways
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing that I like to do is start
with a moisturizer
I cannot apply my foundation or anything
without moisturizer because my skin is
quite dry and I like to have that really
moist slippery feeling on my face when I
apply my foundation so I'm just applying
a light moisturizer all over my face the
one that I use is the simple kind of
skin light hydrating moisturizing lotion
I've been using a stock for like comment
three or so years now
still on strong with it and then I'm
going to take the Nivea men sensitive /
shave bar I'm going to just as a primer
on my face so usually I don't use
primers but the other day I went to a
festival music festival it was super hot
and usually my makeup comes off within 5
or so hours in the Sun and my makeup
actually stayed on and the only
different thing that I did with my
makeup was apply this and I was so
incredibly happy so I'm going to start
using this on the regular it literally
just makes your foundation stick to it I
was so shocked when actually worked like
what so I'm just going to rub this all
over my skin until it gets super tacky
okay I cannot deal with my hair down
when I'm doing my makeup
I really can't so when it comes to
foundations there are a bunch of
different ones that I use it really
depends on the finish that I want if I
want like a medium to full coverage or
just a nice healthy coverage and also
depends on the color of my neck as well
so two of my favorite are the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation in the shade
warm beige and
also the Georgia online a luminous silk
foundation in the shade six these are
really good if I want a quite full
coverage and I have adapt Han another
one that I love is the Charlotte Tilbury
light wonder foundation this is no shade
six and this is the one I'm a little bit
lighter and also when I want a really
nice healthy glow and I also like to mix
in this Wonder glow staffed by shot
he'll reduce to add a luminous finish I
know that's like a lot of products to
take in at once but these two together
are perfect for holding this glue so
that's what I'm going to do today and I
would have to say at least 50% of time I
do lean towards the Charlotte Tilbury
products so I'm just going to put a bit
on the back of my hand oh my god I think
this is going to be a little bit too
white I just applied a freshman and then
a little bit of the flash under glue I
think flashes there and now I'm just
going to take my Beauty Blender and dab
this all over my face oh my god this
stuff is honestly so incredible it's
people right on the skin and it doesn't
feel like you've got anything on there
at all which is a massive plus for me
I'm also going to blend it onto my ears
because I didn't pretend my little ears
and I don't paint in my face either
because when I wash my face it literally
just comes off with into washes it looks
so good when you have a nice tan face
but what can you do
I have a little bit of acne scarring
that I like to cover up on my cheeks
over here and this stuff does such a
good job but it still looks like your
skin which is exactly or what I'm after
today sometimes I like salt cake piece
but not to know once that's all evenly
spread on my face I'm going to go in
with concealer to cancel out the
discoloration under my eyes and I also
like to highlight under there as well to
make me look super awake so I'm going to
take the NARS a radiant creamy concealer
in the shade custard this is a nearly
empty I need to get a new one oh wait
maybe not you know so I'd like to put it
under my eyes and down the center of my
face as well and then again blending it
out with my Beauty Blender just grabbing
really softly so it sticks into my skin
and now to set that concealer I'm going
to take the other macei√≥ translucent
setting powder this stuff comes in handy
all the time I absolutely love it so I'm
going to take all those lots of powder
on my wedge I'm going to take a chunk of
that powder on a wedge and just pack
that under my eyes and this is also
going to help it so nice and bright as
well so while that's baking under my
eyes I'm going to take the boy brown
foundation stick in the shade 6.5 this
is beautiful - really runs up the skin
so I either do this or I take a powder
contour shade which I usually use my
hoola by benefit but today I want more
of like a bronzy look so what I'm going
to do is just dab it on the back of my
blender and then put it under my
cheekbones when I directly put it on my
cheeks they're literally just takes up
the foundation and it leaves a white
line it's just really messy so I'm going
to put on with my PD blender so I'm just
placing it where I would usually put my
contour shade I just love like a really
dewy finish and anything that's powdery
is obviously going to take away from
that shine so
I also would like to take it around the
forehead as well this just adds a really
nice bronzy look and it makes the
forehead look at tiny bit smaller
you've got a small forehead I'd probably
stay away from this step and then I like
to go in again with the laura mercier
translucent powder and set the rest of
my face just very lightly because I
still want a shine to come through but I
want the powders and stuff that I could
over top to still be able to blend
so I feel like a little bit more
definition on the cheekbone so I'm just
going to take my whole by benefit and my
eater brush by Niles this brush is so
good for contouring I'm just going to
put a little bit under my cheekbone to
define that even more
full blush today I'm taking the Ignasi
in a shade at lustre I really love coral
shimmery shades again to keep the face
looking really glowy so just going to
put this on the apples of my cheeks and
blend it back and I feel like blush
really does make the makeup look so much
better it just like brings everything
together because obviously when you're
putting foundation stuff on you're
washing all the color on your face so
you want to put put a bit more back in
for even more bronzing this to the skin
I'm gonna take be a Mac gold deposit
minerals skin finish on this blush brush
by Real Techniques
this is the best under brush ever and
was going to put this right in the
cheekbones this has a beautiful shimmer
to it it's amazing if I was just going
out on a normal day I probably would
only either do the cream contour the
powder or the bronzer but some reason I
feel like going all out today for
highlighter I'm going to take the back
light in the shade and moonstone I
change up my highlighters every single
day I love the Beco highlighter so so
pigmented I'm just going to pop that on
top my cheekbones obviously feeling the
whole bronzy look today on I know
now I'm going to go over my eyelids
would be Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I
still put this on if I'm not applying
eyeshadow just to make sure that all the
foundation doesn't crease in my eyelid
so just popping a little bit on there
also it gets rid of the veins as well so
it's like the best product ever and then
of course just setting that with some
powder make sure it really sticks to my
eyelid all day time but for the mascara
I'm going to take the covergirl big
supersized mascara this has a really
nice applicator so it's easy to make the
lashes to could be so I'm just going to
start wiggling that in my lashes and I
like to take this in zigzag motion so it
really gets in every single lash
this makes my lashes so big nice and
thick as well I love it
and also not forgetting those lower
lashes so I'm going to fill my eyebrows
in just a little bit and I will use my
essence eyebrows stylist set and we're
going to do is just extend them so I do
have my brow I can't like talk at the
same time I do have my eyebrows tattooed
on
so I don't want you to do too much at
all which is really handy because it
saved me a lot of time
depending if I want to our lipstick or
not I'll either go in with some poor
pointment or the MAC lipstick and shade
honey laughs this is a perfect everyday
nude color I love it so much and then
the lip liner I like to use is the Too
Faced in the shade a perfect nude so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
define my lips a tiny bit and then put
some for pointman on because I'm not
doing anything too fancy today so I
don't know if you like wearing lipstick
and lastly I like to finish it off with
the Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray oh wow I just drowned
myself in that didn't I
so there we have the finished makeup
look I hope you guys loved it it's
definitely super super easy to recreate
and it doesn't take too long at all
so obviously sometimes I wear a lot less
makeup than this or a lot more it just
depends on how I'm feeling but today I
kind of feel like going a little bit
more glam then also yeah I hope you guys
like this video if you do that please
give it a big thumbs up because it helps
me ask so so much and I'll see you very
soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
