channel so in today's video I really
want to do something nice and fresh and
light
well not light but I wanted to look
really glowy and like healthy so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
this video I'm so usual I'm going to
prime my eyes with the heart-shaped tape
because I want to get rid of all those
fades I've already done my eyebrows as
well I just feel like that's so boring
to watch so I always get passed that far
so a lot of the time when I do my makeup
my eyes are water so bad and it ruins my
whole eye shadow it happened to me when
I was going clouding the other day I
think it was my lashes because I was so
big but I've worn those lashes like so
many times so it only happens sometimes
so I just watch this video and it said
if you put hot water on your eyes before
you do your makeup it stops your water
stops your eyes from watering so just
did that so I'm hoping and I don't water
in this video because it honestly is so
annoying so if you guys have that
problem I'll leave the video that I'm
talking about in the description below
and of course I'm just going to set that
base down with the Rimmel stay matte a
long-lasting pressed powder in exclaims
parent you guys probably know by now if
you've been watching me for a while and
obsessed with this stuff and I just got
this new brush from morphe it is CR 3
and I have a feeling because when we
like for literally perfect to set the
eyes it's so fluffy now it's time for
the eye shadow so I actually have never
used this palette I don't think I have
anyway this one is the true face sweet
peach palette I want to do something
really light and soft on the eyes but
still like you put in some effort so the
first shade that I'm going to take is
this flowery shade a beautiful warm tone
what can I say I'm obsessed with these
colors so I'm just going to take my Mac
2 to 4 and I'm going to blend this in
the crease just a little bit of
definition this brush is literally my
favorite brush it needs higher world for
the crease it just kind of like blends
everything out for you
what could you ask for the next share
that I'm going to take is this one right
here which is called nectar and I'm just
going to pop this all over the lid which
is going to add a nice wash of Sheen oh
this is a little fallout and that my
friend is why you always do
your eyeshadows first you can just laugh
away and see what is another accessible
app the next color I'm taking for the
eyeshadow is this one right here and
it's called a super yarn I'm just going
to warm up the crease just a tiny bit I
still want it to be appropriate for the
daytime but I just want a little bit
more warmth in there because I'm a
sucker for anything that is warm here
sorry
it's also going to add a tiny bit more
definition to the crease next up I'm
going to take this Rimmel in start
fixing go this one is a setting spray
and a primer at the same time so I'm
just going to scrape this all over my
face to make sure my makeup stays lit
also and seriously this smells so good
has cucumber extract in it I just want
to eat it seriously it's so refreshing
but okay before we move any further I
just wanna say thank you so much to
Rimmel for sponsoring this video you
guys know I'm always honest with my
sponsors is let's move on now it's time
to move on to the foundation I'm taking
the Rimmel wake me up foundation this
one has been a reformulated which is a
wave so exciting I have a shade 3:03 a
true nude so this one now has by Messina
which i think is awesome so it's gonna
be really good for your skin and it is
also anti your fatigue so it's going to
make your face look really awake and
healthy and glowy why brush should I use
today family is this one right here this
one's from the brand kaboosh
I love applying foundation with this
brush it just looks so airbrushed so
this has a really nice medium to full
coverage which is what I like for my god
this color is amazing this foundation
feels so light on the skin and pretty
impressed so I'm just going to cup my
brows out because I still want them to
be nice and defined they literally just
went over the arch my browser goodbye
shape
I love happens to the best of us right
now it's time for the concealer I'm
taking the Rimmel wake me up concealer
this one is in the shade at classic
beige so I just want to really highlight
under the eyes so it can make everything
look super awake and brightened which is
exactly what this concealer does because
of the formula just want to make sure to
get right on that inner corner because
that's what all the circle turns are
this concealer is super creamy and it's
also kind of like hydrating under the
eyes it's not making my wrinkles stand
out
I hate when that happens I'm going to do
some creamer highlighting and contouring
so we can look at glowy as we can sir
I'm starting out with the Becca opal
shimmering skin perfecter this is the
liquid one so I'm just going to tap this
on my finger to warm it up and then I'm
just going to pop it on my cheeks I love
the way with liquid highlighters but
because they don't look powdery Apple
they just look really healthy and glowy
and like fresh if not I mean or me gosh
I haven't used this one in so long as
the Bobbi Brown foundation stick in the
shade at 6.5 so I'm just going to put
this on magnetic blender and then blend
onto my face because if you put it
straight onto your face it's just going
to take the foundation straight off and
you have a line you do not want that so
so a little bit on there and then zaps
it onto the skin it looks so good this
color is perfect if you have a similar
skin turn to money I'm also going to do
my jaw bone as well add a bit of
definition to that Ashley I'm also going
to put this around my forehead as well
to really bronze that up to set my
concealer down I'm taking this lip
chlorella Prarie loose setting powder in
the shade translucent this one is so
expensive you definitely don't need to
use this one you can use any drugstore
one anything that works you really but
since it was expensive I'm going to get
my money's worth key and because the
concealer is so wide I'm just going to
take a really small amount we don't
really need to put too much product to
set back down and very lightly I'm just
going to rush that away but don't be too
heavy-handed because you don't concealer
to move at all now for mascara I'm
taking be a Bobbi Brown smoky eye
mascara I've never used this one before
so I'm just going to coat my top lashes
oh my gosh this does an amazing job it
really separating the lashes it looks
like I have a million for once in my
life and it makes them really black but
I wouldn't say it makes them stick so
I'm gonna have to go on with another
mascara over the top now for the
eyeliner I'm taking this one from Stila
it is the smudge stick a waterproof
eyeliner and it is in the shade I'll
leave it down below this is going to
make the eyes look a lot bigger and
more awake whoa that really worked and
then just going in with that Bobby Brown
mascara on the lower lashes oh my gosh
it's making my lower lashes look so good
I've honestly never looked this long
before for a little bit of a glow on the
inner corners I'm going to take that
same ad-lib color and I'm just going to
put that right on the tear duct I
sprayed my breath with my roots I just
had rough I just sprayed my brush with
some mac's fix+ to make sure it's really
intense then you just did a big smile
okay
I wasn't going to add lashes just
because I want this look to be natural
but as you can see I just put a pair of
like long but kind of natural lashes on
and it just looks so much better so I'm
going to stick these on these ones are
from Adele on they go
these ones are being used like a million
times you think it's so hard to get on
now it's time for the bronzer so I'm
taking this one from our eye this one is
in the shade bronzing gold it is a
phenomenal if you guys haven't tried
this I would definitely recommend it if
you like shimmery bronze is like a
really nice glow to the face so I'm just
going to take that on this a more feet
why one how beautiful is this packaging
what so I'm just going to dust that
right where I put that cream contour and
up the lender add a little bit
time for the blush I'm going to take the
math flash in the shade at Spring Sheen
at this one is a really pretty Coralie
peachy shimmery blush it's stunning I'm
just going to take that on my morphe M
five-30 my bottom eye brushes are
literally from morphe because they sent
me a million brushes and they're that
good I did buy a lot when I was in LA as
well they're not like all sent to me
just so your Mon I did buy a lot from
there yeah let's put this on the apples
of my cheeks just for a little bit of a
flush of color I love the backlashes
I honestly don't think you guys are
ready for this this allows me out of the
park it is the G way highlight in the
shade rose gold so this is what it looks
like it is a beautiful pinky champagne
e:h highlight okay I'm sorry I'll stop
being weird or now but I'm just going to
apply this on top of that other
highlight so we can add even more of a
glow honestly this would have to be one
of my favorite highlighters at the
moment it is just sort of fine so it
doesn't look powdery on the face but it
is so intense it has like this beautiful
yellowy gold reflect but then when you
turn kind of like a pinky color oh my
what now it's time for the lips I'm
taking this Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
lip pencil I use it all the time they're
amazing this one is in the shade uptight
kind of punch methods with ease so I'm
just going to go ahead and line my lips
I'm just going to fill in this side to
my lip because I love this color and
then I'm taking this a more Fiat liquid
lipstick in the shade button it smells
so good I kind of like the color cause
make one but not as strong
and then over the top of that I'm taking
this Bobby Brown lip gloss in the shade
crystal packing this on hon oh wow
huzzah glossy I love the way they still
live looks I'm obsessed okay so last May
I'm just going to set my face with the
same prime values before the Rimmel
