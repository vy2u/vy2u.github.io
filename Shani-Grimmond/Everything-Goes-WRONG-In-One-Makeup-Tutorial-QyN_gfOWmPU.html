haven't seen you in so long I missed you
so much I'm really happy to be sitting
down and still me again it literally
just feel moved so I have a bunch of
makeup in front of me right here that I
just wanted to throw on my face and it's
pretty much just makeup that I never
ever use or makeup that is brand new and
I want to test it out because I've had
so many mixed opinions on all these
products and I'm like I need to sit down
and try these products for myself and
see how they go so I really hope you
guys find this video interesting it's
one of those makeup tutorials where like
nothing works out like literally nothing
but I thought it'd be interesting for
you guys so you can see like kind of how
they perform on my skin so I hope you
guys have an amazing day give this video
a big thumbs up and let's go ahead and
get started so I have a bunch of new
makeup that I want to try the first
thing is the Too Faced and natural love
eyeshadow palette ultimate neutral
eyeshadow collection it is called so
these are all the colors and my first
impression of the palette is it looks
really pretty but there's really not a
lot of transition shades in here so I
feel like you couldn't really make a
whole look like the only transition
shades I can see is this brown this
brown and this brown so I guess that's
what we're going to do so the first
shade I'm taking is honey butter and
that's going to crease I've honestly had
so many mixed reviews about this palette
I'm really interested to see how it goes
on me so two shades blending out really
nicely it's not really dark at all so
you can't really see too much color yeah
let's have a little catch-up about what
I've been up to so on the weekend I had
to meet up at the Gold Coast which was
so much fun honestly met like a thousand
of you guys which took literally like
five hours but it was so worth it in the
end I just felt so full my heart was so
full had the best time and then like
obviously I'm packing ever since like
it's actually been so long oh my god
there's honestly no lighter shades that
I can use as my transition so I'm going
to go in with the it cosmetics and
naturally propellent my dog ate the
corner of this if you wonder what's
happening there I'm going to take the
shade right here and I'm just going to
blend that over the top of the last
color
because I feel like I didn't really show
up too much at all
I'm honestly so happy that me and
Johnson moved houses I'm obsessed with
this place it's so much bigger and I'm
here I just I love moving I mean I hate
the process but I love being in new
places all the time because I just kept
board over like staying in the same
place but I don't think I'll be able to
do a house tour just because like I'm
scared someone's going to like pick up
where it is but um look I don't I trust
you guys but there are some like you
know creates watching my videos
sometimes I guess so I can't really do a
house tour because of that reason you
will see you in like the back of my
vlogs and on my snapchat anyway if you
guys don't have me on snap it is just
add shown agreement okay oh my god this
palette isn't showing up very much on my
skin either I literally have a feeling
like nothing's going to work for me
today I understood I think I'm going to
keep this palette but I am going to do a
decluttering videos because I'm obsessed
with watching them I've been watching
Chen EXO's and it's literally like a
fetish to me to watch them like I love
watching people clean out their makeup
collection it just gives me so many
different feels unlike yours so I'm
going to do that no see you even though
I just decoded it I literally just like
threw out three but throughout I gave
away three bags of makeup so I should
should assume that the next day that I'm
going to take is makeup and church is
this matte brown down here and I kind of
want to do a brown smokey eye so I'm
just going to pack this all over my lid
I'm going to go back in with this it
cosmetics palette I'm going to blend a
color in my crease omegle nothing is
literally working to me today like this
ishow look looks like so many kinds of
different ships and that two-faced color
blend it away there's air cosmetics
shadows alike catch to do my cruise like
they're just not bloody they're just
like stop down you can see that so I'm
just going to use products that I never
usually use just to change it up a bit
so the next thing I'm going to take is
the chichi super CC cream and I have the
shade medium to cancer I used to love
this stuff I used to wear every single
day that sliders it literally nearly
empty so let's give it a whirl
I mean it's probably off but it's a
really nice life
neutral yellow color so I'm just going
to apply this with the new Morpheus
sponge I just got this in the mail like
a few years ago so let's see how it goes
the sponges so much harder than the CD
bundle I kind of like the Beautyblender
better let's just say that I don't think
that this is as good as I used to think
it was I think it is a little bit patchy
oh my god honestly have it use this in
it so long it's the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer and I used to be obsessed
with it's a pretty short so I'm just
going to put this underneath my eyes
I'm definitely happy going to get a lot
of shade so the delayed and the darker
than my skin this is like one shade
lighter
let's look like that when the glow just
missed the tube and it went all over my
hand see so I'm going to blend that
concealer in aware that this edge of the
sponge which looks really good for
learning concealer and so let's do this
I feel like it's going to make that eye
shadow line nice and harsh which is what
I like so I try to do with a Beauty
Blender but this would like make it
easier I feel it's kind of hard to blend
on the inner corner right here but it is
so easy to get that really sharp line
there oh I'm going to take this eye
brightener from bareMinerals it is in
the shade well rested so I'm going to
use this to kind of like set my
concealer down I'm not sure if I should
paper that I'll just like kind of Pat it
down imagine like a little bit of baking
if that doesn't blend away into nothing
I'm going to be a really angry see what
I mean I have like all of this makeup in
my cupboard because like I never use
this stuff in a meeting now and majority
of it is Maegan good so that's why I
need to do a decluttering video and just
like try out everything so I know what's
good and what's not so I can keep the
good stuff so I got this a few weeks ago
and I used it in a video it's the bomb
powder foundation in the shade medium
and I'm still like on the fence if I
like it so I'm going to use it for the
last time today and I'm going to make my
mind obvious I want to keep it or not
and then I just don't feel like it like
does anything at all in order
like I can't see any coverage and if
it's a powder foundation it should
definitely be adding coverage not only
setting the face you know my face is
still so sticky so like if my face is
sticky I feel like all the powder like
the blonds losing the blush and stuff
that I put at the top will go patchy
because it's like sticking to like
wetness I'm going to brush away that
powder underneath my eyes and hurts the
best oh my god is this actually like
happening I just like lightly brush it
off and this is what's happened so one
way to do now is take that dark brown
shade and put this on my lower lash line
from outer corner all the way to inner
corner now it's time for mascara so I'm
taking the Maybelline default ease
push-up drama mascara the last time that
I use this it was really wet and it
transferred everywhere so we're gonna
see if this is worthy of keeping it's
doing an amazing job at making my lashes
nice and thick but like actually my lash
just touched my eyelid and that's
already true dots on there and I'm being
so careful it's just like a really wet
formula so it's like nearly impossible
to not get on your eyeshadow
okay so I've left all of these lashes to
dry for a few minutes now it's time to
do the lower lashes remember to get this
stuff I love big juicy lashes see it's a
really transferred up here and that
should be dry already do you see what I
mean what the
anyways I'm just going to wait for that
mascara to dry so then we can like take
it off with a spoolie sorry for the
lashes today I'm using these Empire
lashes I've never used these before I
don't think so they look really pretty
they have really nice packaging I do
have a lot so I just want to make sure
that the band is like really easy to
work with so um let's see how it goes
there's literally only so much I can
scratch until it literally just makes my
bleed as much as I love like all of
these companies that I'm talking about
like there's so many products from these
companies that I love but like at the
end of the day I'm making these videos
to you I'm not making these videos to
please companies I'm it's just me when I
like trying to sort out what's good
not there's always like hittin messes
when it comes to brands and like that's
a given so no one gets too offended I'm
just going to grab the tweezers and
stick the inner corners down and then we
kind of pinch the lash band and the real
lash together okay whew we found a pair
of lashes that work really well I
wouldn't say that the easiest lashes to
put on the band is very thick but they
look stunning and at the end of the day
stick this stuff down oh my god I forgot
to tell you guys I got my nails done and
I got a new shape I wanted them to look
kind of natural like a grew them myself
and then they kind of tone into this and
I love how they look they're definitely
not natural-looking but they're super
short and then again the way of anything
which is exactly why I love them I love
this color my now sell-on got like three
colors and I was like being kini because
I was about to like not come back
because I was getting the same two
colors for literally like four months I
was kind of over it
well what next I'm going to take the
Australis AC on to our contouring and
highlighting palette and I used to love
this so much but I've been seeing a lot
of people kind of like talk about
and say it's not that good anymore so
I'm like okay let's just see what's
happening so I've come to terms that I
can't use cool tones to contour anymore
because it just looks super muddy on my
skin tone so I'm going to take this
color right here and this palette is for
black complexion so if this doesn't work
for me then I don't know how it's going
to work for anyone
lighter than me so let's see how it goes
it's going to take a little bit oh I was
surfing with it I just dusted most of it
off I'm just going to put this on my
cheekbones I like the way this one looks
it is a little bit patchy I'm producer
that's just because of my foundation
underneath it that's not this so the
only two colors actually probably use
three colors algae's palette I'd use
this one this one to highlight and then
this one to set my eyeshadow like set my
primer on my lid next we have a bronzer
this one is the mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade at Sun Palace oh
this one is very very Orange I'm getting
this for Dickensian tones because this
could literally never work for me and I
want to show you guys why so even when I
put like the smallest amount on it just
goes like right
right orange so I do love the dark
golden mineralized skinfinish and also
the give me son
like I love those so much but this is
something that I can never really use so
I don't know why I'm ordering it to do
that with all my makeup this will just
have to be your like my fault as to why
it doesn't work for me because it is
just not my color
definitely not my color oh my goodness
now it's time for blush I'm going to try
these Milani powder blushes right so
these what I use them didn't really show
up too well on my skin so I just want to
make sure that that's correct because I
have a lot of makeup and I'm pretty sure
all of these products so let's give them
a try and see if they work so I'm just
going to fill my brush in here nothing's
really coming on my brush look cool it's
leaning oh my god I'm so confused like
nothing come off of my brush but then
there's like a big cute patch there I
don't even know what's happening right
now
oh my god I'm so excited about these
products so I have the highlighters I
have a shade salted caramel and french
vanilla so let's give this a try I
literally got these yesterday they took
so long to come I'm pretty sure
they took over a month to get here but
um they're here and now it's time to see
if they're good this was a highlight
looks like that does look really pretty
and then we have the shade salted
caramel which looks so nice
I really want to swatch it should we
swatch it let's do it I'm just gonna do
like true swatches like this oh my god
that was sort of weird it feels really
like fine like it's so soft
definition off on my hand though
everyone like was watching it online and
it looks so bad I mean he is a really
dense brush because I want to pack it on
so I'm going to start by going in with
salted caramel see what this looks like
so giving it a good swatch in there I
mean it's definitely like showing off
like wow it's not as like intense as the
most highlight but you can definitely
build it up I mean like are you kidding
me
so now let's go into the shade at French
Mila on the other side of the brush so
just going to swatch it really well in
there and just go on in
first impression of this shade I would
have to say this is probably a little
bit true Laxmi it does look a bit chalky
on my skin so if you do have a lot of
skin turn to me I think this would be a
good one
but if you do have my kind of skin tone
this one is so pretty so I'm just going
to put a bit of this on my nose to
highlight right here yeah see it doesn't
it you really have to build it up to get
it like how most people like to
highlight is next I have a Kylie Jenner
velvet liquid lipstick and lip liner
these are the new ones that just came
out and I have all the other shades like
just a normal liquid lipsticks because I
want to see if it's like similar to any
of these because literally it looks the
same so let's see oh yeah as you can see
Kandy K is a few shades darker so I'm
happy with that
so I'm just going to go ahead and line
my lips with a shade charm and the only
reason why I don't like this packaging
for the lip liner is because I find them
so hard to sharpen and then the actual
lip liner comes flying out once I try
and sharpen it but this one is really
good okay now I'm going to go in with
the velvet formula I'm hoping it's
different and not just like a gimmick
like a different formula well it
definitely feels like more wet
holy-shit so much product comes out in
this applicator I feel like it looks
really good on my lips but I hate the
color so much it looks so much more nude
on the website I just don't like Pink's
if you guys do like pink so it is a
really really nice formula I don't know
how long it's going to take to drive
because it is still really wet but it
does feel so comfortable on the lips so
I'd be happy even if it didn't drive
okay so here we have the finished a
makeup look I really hope you guys found
this video interesting and learnt a few
things everything this video may work
for you and may not work for me that's
just literally how makeup goes on
different skin tones and different skin
textures and colors and all of that so
hope you guys have an amazing day and
I'll see you in my next video hmmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
