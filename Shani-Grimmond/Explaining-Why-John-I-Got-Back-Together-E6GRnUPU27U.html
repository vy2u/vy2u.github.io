really weird because the last time I
filmed a video about this topic I was
crying and it was a really sad video but
this time it's a really happy video and
I just wanted to come in here and
explain to you what happened between
Jonathan and I because the last time I
spoke about it on my youtube channel
properly um Jonathan and I have broken
up here we yeah good to be back talking
about this again to be honest I'm kind
of nervous to film this because so many
people are gonna have so many different
opinions which I can totally respect
everyone's entitled to their own opinion
but obviously at the end of the day
Jonathan and my opinion is the only true
that really matter in this relationship
but I do want to fill you guys in on
what happened just because I tell you
guys everything and I know that a lot of
people can learn from these type of
videos with their relationships and all
of that so um yeah let's let's explain
let's do this okay so pretty much what
happened was Jonathan I break off about
six months ago I'm not exactly sure on
the dates but it was roughly around six
months ago and Jonathan and I was still
on talking terms when we were separated
because he was my manager so the only
thing would really talk about is work
because he lack sorts through all my
emails and sets up on my work and
everything so he was living with me okay
Wow Siri is literally writing down
everything that I'm saying right now
what the
that was weird okay so yeah we're
breaking off for like six or so months
we both went our separate ways we did
have very little communication and I
guess we were both happy like were both
doing our own thing and everything well
I can only speak for myself like I was
really happy and I was happy with my
decision I didn't regret from what I
didn't regret my decision at all I was
really happy with everything and like
everyone like that knew me was very sure
just like myself that I wasn't going to
get back with Jonathan because I was
never something that I had intended that
was going to happen so four or so months
went by of being broken up with him
and I remember I really started to miss
having him around and it didn't really
hit me until I saw him when I was out
why not so just imagine me and my
friends dancing having a great time and
then little Jonathan walks past me and I
look over and I'm like oh my god
the dogs totally ruined that moment
bhindi I remember just thinking what the
 have I done like it literally hit
me like a ton of bricks like yeah I was
missing him yeah I miss having him
around I missed him so much but like at
this point when he walked past me and I
saw him in person I was like holy
I've made the biggest mistake of my life
like at this point I can genuinely say
this is the biggest mistake I've ever
made I just remember thinking in my head
I'm like I'm 100% sure that I need to be
with him I need to make things work like
but in my mind I was like there's no way
he's gonna take me back no way and I'm
telling my friends I'm like oh my god I
need to at least try and get him back
because this is what I want a hunt with
him I'm not gonna change my mind again
like I'm a hundred cent sure like I've
never been so set on something in my
life so I remember that night my friend
and I went home I was very distraught I
was very crying a lot I remember sitting
in my bed with my best friend and we
were just crying our eyes out like what
the hell is gonna happen is he gonna
take me back is he even gonna want to
talk to me about this because like why
would he want to talk to me there's no
work to talk about at the moment well I
didn't really want to work at that
current state of my mind so I wasn't
like doing emails or anything but yeah
my friend and I were like okay well
let's sort out what you're gonna say how
are you gonna even try and get him back
at this point and keep in mind I was
like 99% sure he was not going to take
me back because he's the type of person
that once you break up with someone
who's like not gonna like he's not gonna
grow back into it because what's the
point of breaking up if you can just
sort out the argument that caused the
break-up or the fight or like whatever
reason like if you can't dissolve and
dissolve if you can't solve it and you
break up then what's the point on like
getting back into that relationship I
just like know that he's not going to
take
back so I was just crying and crying and
crying cooling all of my friends like
help me what am i doing they're like
look you're the only person that can fix
this that can make this work so you're
gonna have to go to him and tell him
exactly how you feel and I'm I can't
like I'm feel scared like I'm just so
horrified of telling people how I feel
because I'm always so scared that
they're gonna come back and laugh in my
face and not take what I say seriously
or I don't know I'm always so scared to
tell people how I feel when it comes to
really serious things if it's small
things I always speak my mind and always
tell people how I feel but in this type
of situation where it's like
make-or-break I want to get back with
you like I was horrified so horrified
that I completely ruined everything
the day that I went to talk to him I
begged him to talk to me
bless his soul I went to his house and I
was like look so I didn't want you to be
my manager anymore and the reason why I
said that is because I wanted him to be
more than my manager I wanted him to be
my boyfriend and I didn't know how to
say it so I just said I don't want you
to like a story stupid of me like I
literally just said exactly what I
didn't want to say like I just got so
nervous that I said that and I
completely didn't mean to say in that
way I meant to say I don't want you to
be in a manager but I want you like
hearing me not to finish off my sentence
I didn't say but I want you to like oh
so what I mean cuz I still wanted him to
be my manager but it's just like that in
my mind I'm like oh yeah and that's
gonna work because he's gonna start
asking questions about why I don't want
him to be my manager and then I'll be
able to say it but I couldn't I couldn't
get the balls to say it so I pretty much
left his house and we were pretty much
on like no talking terms like we were
done with each other well he was done
with me bless so I left like thinking
holy actual I've actually
things up proper this time well again
the next day comes around and keep in
mind that night I've never felt like
that in my life I've never felt that
upset and that helpless in my life I
literally wanted to call the ambulance
like I was being so dramatic
I remember texting Jonah and being like
I need help like globe all I kept saying
all this to him and he
obviously so confused because of what I
just said to him about him yeah me not
wanting him to be my manager and he's
just like look you need to seriously
speak to someone because you're
obviously going through a really hard
time you're not taking this breakup
really well and little did he know why I
wasn't taking the break-up well because
I didn't want to be in a breakup with
him anymore I wanted to be with him I
finally ended up going to meet with him
we went to sushi this time because he
was working so we were on his break so
we had an hour to talk and he was
obviously really confused about why
we're meeting up again and I remember
sitting at the table and I went to the
back corner of the sushi room because I
didn't want anyone to see me because I
knew I was gonna cry because I knew that
he wasn't gonna take me back like why
would he have to everything I put him
through like why did I have to get to
this point to realize like I want to be
with you so that's where my mindset was
that I was like there's no way there's
no way but I have to try I remember just
talking I didn't know what I was
saying and then I'm like shiny shiny
like in my head I was like say it say it
say it so I was like would you ever give
me another chance I don't know he was
exactly those words but it was something
like that
I just remember his face was like like
what the is this girl on is she
serious I was pretty much just saying
like I'll do anything to be with you
I'll do anything to make this work
please give me another chance I was like
quite literally begging and in my mind I
thought he was like laughing at me and
his head saying like what is she talking
about why she even sang this she like
why she even trying like I'm not getting
give her another chance but his reaction
actually really shocked me he was like
you have to prove to me that you
actually want me back this time you're
not just like changing your mind again
and I was like oh my god that's when it
hit me
I'll keep in mind we um had to read
changed locations we went into his car
because I was crying too much sushi
really he's like meaning heard the cop
sorry once once we're in the car he's
like you need to prove to me that you
actually want to be with me and I was
like I'll do anything honestly so at
this point I was pretty happy
I left I went home with a massive smile
on my face because he was actually
considering giving me another chance it
wasn't an art so I was running with the
maybe and then I just started like
always asking him if he wanted help with
whatever he was doing if he wanted to go
to movies get dinner whoa just like when
you first start seeing someone like
that's pretty much how I was acting
about always it was like one-sided I was
like asking all the time like to do this
to do that I need help with you as well
ah let me lick your toys while
I'm at it that's pretty much how it went
and I wouldn't expect anything less to
be honest if I was in his position I
probably wouldn't have taken me back off
to everything we went through don't
think I would have but yeah here we go
Jonathan and I are back together we kept
it really quiet for a while because I
didn't want other people's opinions
changing the way he thought about me or
I don't know I just didn't want anyone's
opinion in our relationship because at
that stage it was so delicate and I
didn't want anything to ruin it so I
kept it very private people were saying
like you're doing this for attention and
I'm like honey no I'm doing this because
I want to be with him and I don't want
anything or anyone to ruin it and like
now I can say like I literally want to
spend the rest of my life with him and
like before the break-up I didn't say
that like I couldn't say that like you
didn't want to say it but now I'm like a
hundred percent sure my mind is not
gonna change like I'm set on this and I
know it when I'm set on something like
nothing can change it if you've gone
through breakups before then trust me I
know how you feel if you're going
through one right now just hang in there
it will get better okay so I love you
guys so much thanks so much for
supporting me throughout this whole
breakup throughout everything I honestly
appreciate it so much like without you
guys oh my god that would mean so much
harder even though I didn't really talk
about it that much I'm happy that I can
explain to you now what's happened and
hopefully you guys can learn from it we
can only go up from here girl I love you
guys so much and I'll see you in my next
video bye well that was very manly
