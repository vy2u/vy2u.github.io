to my channel so in today's video I'm
doing a Q&amp;amp;A I haven't done one in so
long and I love letting you guys get to
know me a bit and I love filling you in
with my life so let's go ahead and jump
into the questions the first question is
what's a quality you love best about
yourself or people you like to be around
I love to surround myself with people
that are really positive and confident
if you're with someone that's positive
it rubs off on you and then I think
confidence then leads into like
happiness and oh no I just love being
around like funny happy people and just
be really chilled and not worry about
what other people think of you and just
worry about yourself and just have a
good time and everyone else really
the next question is that what is the
most embarrassing thing you've done
everyone wants to know this um I
honestly I hardly ever get embarrassed
anymore like the other day when I was in
Sydney I got my period and I was like oh
god I got my period and I literally went
into the beach and I already had it and
I didn't have anything I didn't have a
tan or anything and I'm just like I just
can't be bothered if I get embarrassed I
don't really care because I don't get
embarrassed so I went into the beach and
it was all fun and then I sat on the
towel and I was like fun of my towels I
okay I better go now but I don't know I
just I don't really get embarrassed
anymore unless it's around like a
massive group of people which could have
been the whole beach but in there I
didn't think of it like that now that I
think of it that's kind of gross but
like oh well the next question is have
you ever wondered if your neighbors have
heard you have a sexy time I honestly
have never thought about that in my life
but when I was in San Francisco there
was like my apartment and then my
neighbor's apartment and me and Jonathan
was staying there for like a week and
they happen to come in on the last day
and there's only a really thin wall
between us and we heard them for like 25
minutes it was so loud honestly it was
just like oh my god that reminds me when
I went to Melbourne about two months ago
I was outside on the balcony in my
high-rise it was really tall and I was
just looking out
looking at the view and then I happen to
come across a guy and a girl making out
in their high-rise are about to have sex
and they turned around they saw me
looking and I was like I mean it was
like me nor my friends looking but it
was funny I had to look the next
question is does your line SG the label
contain anything else and a bring
anything else out so if you guys I don't
know I do have my own label that is SG
the label and at the moment it is just
watches so obviously I do want to bring
more things out right now I'm actually
creating something that I know you guys
will love because I know Watchers isn't
for everyone so of course I want to keep
bringing out new things for different
people and different different audiences
I haven't made a video about my watches
yet just because I don't want to like
shove it down your throat kind of thing
but they are going on sale in a few days
again we just had to restock if you guys
are interested in checking them out I
will leave the Instagram it down below
I'm so proud of myself and so proud of
Jonathan because he's been a massive
part of this whole process and it's
definitely been a lot different to the
job that I have now I wouldn't even call
this a job but like filming it's a lot
different to filming but yeah I love it
and it's fun to just do different things
with my career so I thought I was
wearing Camilla bikinis in the photo
that I'm promoting the Q&amp;amp;A on definitely
not Camilla I'm definitely not paying
back hundred dollars per pair bikinis
although I haven't had a really weird
obsession with bags lately like designer
bags I'm not like a big designer girl
but then when it comes to bags I'm like
yes I'm sorry that I'm so annoying why
why why the next question is what has
influenced you to be the person that you
are today there are so many different
things that has made me the person that
I am today the main things would
definitely be like my family my mum and
dad especially boys honestly the way
guys treated me growing up it just made
me I'm not going to like every guy
treating me like there was a few
guys growing up that treated me really
bad and then it took me a while to be
like oh my god no like that's not how
people should treat me I know how I
should be treated I know how I should
treat people and yeah that definitely
shaped me uhm I know like my worth now
after that I'm really I'm glad that
happened I'm glad
I got hurt from guys in the past but
yeah my friends have also made me the
person I am today being there for me
showing how like loving a person can be
and mostly you guys have shaped me into
the person I am completely if I never
had made a YouTube channel I think I'd
still be that really shy girl that I was
in grade 10 especially in primary school
I was so shy like when I go see family
friends at like dinners and stuff
they're like oh my god I can't believe
like you're not shy anymore it's so
weird how you just grew out of it and I
always think to myself it's literally
because I have a youtube channel I've
gained so much confidence from that and
I really found myself I don't know I'm
so cheesy the last question is is it
hard having a lot of your life public or
is that something that doesn't bother
you it definitely gets hard a lot of the
times I would not take it for granted
I'm so happy for what I have and you
guys supporting me but sometimes it does
get really hard when it comes to like my
friends getting approached by like other
people wanting to be friends with them
to get to me or like people messaging
Jonathan all the time to get to me or
people trying to befriend me to grow
they're like followers like all this
 that people have going through
their minds that doesn't even matter
like having followers it doesn't matter
all that matters is like being happy and
having genuine friends so I think that
gets really like people get really
confused about that sometimes and they
like try to be my friend for like the
wrong reasons and it always comes out at
the end because I know who's genuine and
who's not there's just a few things that
I pick up on when I'm like oh I don't
think this person has like the right
intentions with me and that is when like
someone asks me to promote them
instantly I'm like no I can't deal I
just like to run myself with people that
don't care about followers because I'm
constantly always trying to make my
followers grow because it's my job and
it's obviously something I love doing so
I don't know I just like to have friends
that don't care about it so then I can
have that time away from everything and
then this time but that's okay because
you guys are so worth all of that and I
would never ever not want this whole
thing to be happening cuz I'm so
incredibly grateful and I feel like I'm
the
I've ever been ever so there we have
this Q a I really hope you guys liked it
if you did please give it a big thumbs
up and if you have any more questions
leave it down below and I'll use the
questions down there for my next Q&amp;amp;A I
was looking for some really juicy
questions but there wasn't really that
much I feel like people are scared to
have their name next to their juicy
question but honestly I don't care what
you write so go write it down there and
I love you guys don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you in my next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
