comes up to us after a number has led
Beauty and then says that we can show

I'm excited about that that's some extra
coverage to my foundation but right now
we're just going to came out across the
road because I've got to get an adapter
because the plug holes are different
here didn't know that and all my laptops
and everything is dead so got to go do
that it's really nice weather today

different to the one at home this is
what we just went shopping and it's like
massive building out there so of course
I got some more makeup at Kmart they

Chloe's lot to the adapter ear girl
so yesterday me Chloe were in it uber
with this lady before doing the pool
which means you like pick up people on
the way in yoruba and she was basically
saying but every time she goes like to
round the wolf in same area she has to
take pepper spray because one time had
come she got attacked so I'm a little
bit nervous to go there because weird
have pepper spray but hopefully no one
doesn't anything I don't know really
it's really dangerous to ever should be
fine because it's like daylight and
everything but it when the other girl
got attacked it was three in the armor
so oh all right guys we're at the walk
of fame right here all the stars so ever
we just got in was really sketchy and
he's right next to me see ye but it
smelt like smoke and weed and a bit of
everything and I don't know how to say
