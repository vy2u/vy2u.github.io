channel sorry in today's video I really
want to do a drug stool a festive makeup
look I have a bunch of drugstore in a
floral product stand yeah and I'm really
excited to play with because I always
use high-end so I thought I'd change it
up a little bit today I really hope you
guys like this video don't forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and let's do this let's start
with the eyebrows so I'm gonna take the
adele medium brown brow pomade and i've
used to one a few times i'm pretty sure
i liked it so i'm just gonna dip my
angled brush in there I'm gonna brush on
my head and then I'm really going to
make them super defined up here on the
arch Jerry cuz I did get my brows headed
on a little while ago and they're kind
of fading out here sorry just focusing
on making that nice and high and then I
like to take the brush underneath my
brow to make a straight line under here
oh my god I really into my brows blocked
oh I do it myself
otherwise I'm sad they're just gonna
take my whole eyebrow off I've had so
many people that go in to get that brows
done and they just like make them sorry
Finn that's a fear not letting that
happen
I'm sorry happy that it's nearly
Christmas so I can go hang out with my
family we got into the gold curse this
year I rented out a room in a high-rise
and I'm gonna stay with my family
because usually every year we stay like
at my mom's house and I know it's just
like super boring there so I thought we
could do something fun this year
time to carve out the eyebrows I'm gonna
go in with the color pop nurse'll to
concealer I've never used this one so
hopefully it is good I have the shade at
medium 30 I'm just gonna put a bit on
the back of my hand
and I'm gonna take a little I don't even
know what these little babies are cool
about one of these brushes and I'm gonna
call that underneath the brow the color
this concealer looks really nice like
it's not too light and then putting a
little bit of the concealer all over my
eyelids
well this concealer has a really nice
coverage now I'm taking the Rimmel stay
matte powder in the shade transparent
and I'm just gonna take a little flat
shader brush well it's kind of like a
fluffy one and I'm gonna pack this all
over my lid so when we put the powders
like all the eyeshadows and stuff over
the top it's not gonna stick to that
concealer much all right so next I'm
gonna go in with the chuchi Maps 2
palette this has a lot of nice cool turn
shades mobs and Browns and stuff so the
first color I'm taking is this one right
here sorry this one and that's going in
my crease and it's gonna be a transition
you know how do you girl and the brush
and I'm using is from Inglot it's so
soft and fluffy it's the 6ss these
eyeshadows are pretty good for drugstore
and not gonna lie I really like them and
next I'm gonna take this chocolate brown
color right here and I'm gonna take that
on a smaller blending brush so we can
really focus it in the crease and make
that nice and dark and if for a fact
when it comes to a Christmas Day and
stuff I won't be doing anything overly
dramatic like this but I mean I thought
a few people would appreciate it and
besides you don't even have to wear it
to like a festive occasion you can wear
it any time of the year so the only time
I really do really dramatic makeup is
clubbing huh are you guys going shopping
on Boxing Day because I don't think I
have the balls to do it I went shopping
yesterday in the city and oh my god it
was sorry Pat I couldn't even move like
I was with my little brother and sister
and I kept I like kept turning around
and I kept losing the bastards oh I'm
sorry I figured I have young audience
sometimes then going back in with that
concealer again I'm just gonna make a
cut crease because I'm gonna do
something really sparkly on the eyelid
so I went to
stand out so I'm just taking that same
color pop concealer with a flat shader
brush I'm just going to cover the crease
handle it that is all over my lid then
i'm going to crickey hurt now I'm gonna
go in with the Rimmel stay matte powder
once again and just pack down on top of
that concealer the only product that
really isn't drugstore is this one right
here it's the violet boss at glitter
glue so what I'm gonna do is just pop
this all over the lid where I put that
concealer and then we're gonna go in
with the next product which is really
cool
I mean I have to put the glitter on my
eyelid one eye at a time now I'm gonna
take the NYX glitter brilliance this
one's in the shade zero six I'm so
excited to apply this you have no idea I
feel like this would be perfect for like
New Year's Eve oh my god
we have a lot of Fallout but that's okay
oh my god I legit look like a bold eagle
right now this is weird it's gonna look
really cool soon sir now I'm going in
with the Oh have a go
turtle turtle taste mascara I'm just
gonna cart my top lashes because I
really want to put falsies on now
because I feel like it's really
distracting without lashes oh this drama
on the lid oh my god there's glitter
old firm in my scar right now now I'm
gonna go in with some Holy Grail lashes
these ones are super affordable that $12
I'm pretty sure sorry definitely
drugstore prices but you just have to
get them online so let me go ahead and
pop this bad boy on I actually did wear
this like last week so I'm just gonna
peel off all the extra glue and
eyeshadow then it's gonna be it's good
its new I always use lashes like at
least three times at least let's do this
my favorite part of the makeup is
applying lashes these ones this is so
wispy I'm not putting any liner on with
these ones I'm just putting it as close
as I can to my lash line and then
pinching the two together now it's time
to prime the face my face feels so dry
right now because I just had to use like
20 makeup wipes to get all the glitter
off my skin and I'm over it so I'm gonna
go with the NYX HD primer base right
here and I'm just gonna pop this on the
back of my hand oh my gosh that's so
liquidy beautiful and we're gonna keep
saying that why
but it's everywhere and I'm just gonna
pop this all over my face oh wow a
little bit gross a very long way I
literally just dunked in that tiny bit
the whole face in my opinion are one of
the best drugstore foundations is the
wet and wild further focused foundation
this one's in the shade golden beige
best color and I had a little spatula on
the end so I'm just gonna pop this all
over my face do a really nice color if
you have a fake tan or of course if
you're lucky enough to be naturally tan
with like an all-over yellow undertone
then I'm just gonna go in and blend it
out with my Beauty Blender oh my gosh
nothing ever sticks to my nose sir I
just want to tell you guys what happened
the other day sir I think like three
days ago I went to Sydney to shoot with
a brand but I'm not to say what brain
yet until but I usually get started
scared doing like photo shoots and like
video shoots and everything I always
turn him down but I was like no I need
to do it this time and just step out of
my comfort zone
and I did it and I honestly had so much
fun like I really want to do that stuff
more often it's just different because
like obviously you know obviously like
when I'm filming these types of videos
there's near like interaction with other
people so I think that's really
important to like maintain so I'm gonna
push myself to do more shoots and stuff
cause it was super fun just a little tip
of the day always push yourself guys you
can always improve no matter what it is
it's sorry we'd having dark hair now cuz
I have to be really careful when I'm
blending my foundation like into my
hairline cuz it makes it gir like grey
then of course going in with that color
pop concealer again this is really gonna
put it to the test when it's under my
eyes I think I need to take a lot of
shade as well cuz that's kind of like
the same color as my foundation but at
least it's gonna get rid of the dark
circles that's all that really matters
to me
doing this oh that's so good I wonder
from Kylie cosmetics is the same formula
what's this one because didn't they come
out with them at the same time oh we ran
the similar timing no it's good so it
doesn't matter like where it comes from
that next I'm gonna take the Rimmel
match perfection silky loose face powder
I love this one so much and it's super
affordable so I'm just gonna put a
little bit in the lid and then pack that
under here and it's gonna like to stock
up any excess concealer and it's gonna
make sure we don't crease up going back
in with the Rimmel stay matte powder I'm
just going to Pat this all over my face
to set it I always use like a foundation
powder but today I thought let's change
it up because I'm over oh my god I said
that way too much like relax I don't
know where you guys are from in the
world but can I just tell you in
Australia it is seriously so hard at the
moment like I don't even want to leave
the house at this point I'm just so
grateful for my icon and I'm pulling
today okay
oh my god Schiele jump to the table say
hello can you see cuz all the lights ooh
Brad if it gets the dog on the mouth
you'll get worms oh right going back in
with that crease color I'm gonna put
that on my lower lashline to even that
out a little bit you know how this now
going in with mascara on my lower lashes
this is gonna really make the eye look
pop next up is to contour so I'm taking
the Bahama Mama the balm bronze I
haven't you sweat in so long I actually
never really contour anymore so I'm just
gonna take a really small amount and pop
that under my cheek bone and then to
bronze up my skin I'm taking the Milani
a baked bronzer this one's in the shade
golden sir I'm going in with that same
brush and putting this like pretty much
everywhere oh my gosh
beautiful
I'm taking around my hairline cheap iron
jawline this is like super shimmery as
well so if you know like shimmery stay
clear now for a little bit of blush I'm
taking the essence silky touch blush
this one's in the shade ad autumn peach
I love the essence blushes they're super
affordable I just want a tiny pop of
pink on the cheeks I'm just putting this
on the apples and blending it back
obviously you want to be dramatically
highlighted for like New Year's or like
the festive season so I'm gonna take the
Wet n Wild and make a glow highlighting
a powder this one is in the shade
precious pearls and it is so beautiful
so what I'm gonna do is just spray my
brush with some Australian which I
think's pretty beautiful and I'm gonna
make it super dramatic girl you've no
idea well you probably do it cuz you
watch my videos right if you don't
subscribe right let's do this it's like
wet it's so beautiful on the side oh yes
I think a red lip would be really cool
for Christmas but it also be really cool
for New Year's because it's like a
statement statement lip you don't mean
so but for me personally I probably do a
nude for New Year's but it's totally up
to you I'm gonna do red today so this
one is the colour-pop ultra lip stain in
the shade lust
this one's more of a kadar car cherry
red
okay this is so dramatic I'm gonna go
get changed and I'll be back here we
have the finished makeup look I really
hope you guys like it I really want a
necklace for Christmas I feel like it
would just fit perfectly right there
sometimes I say the most random like
 I don't even know what I'm saying
right now um yeah I think it looks
really good I think it'd be perfect for
New Year's Eve or any special occasion
obviously you guys can wear there's
gonna make up whatever you want if you
want to be this extra on a weekday go
