channel so in today's video I really
want to do a festival makeup look
because two days ago I went to a
festival and I had so much fun and when
I was doing my makeup I fell in love
with how the I looked and it was so easy
to do so I thought I'm ready to say my
eyes shut her look and then we're gonna
add some more like glitter to it and
just make it look a little bit more
festively because I never usually go all
out with my makeup for festivals so
today I just thought it was a perfect
excuse to really just playing around
with glitter and different colors and
all that good stuff so let's go ahead
and jump right into the video so the eye
shadow I'm gonna take the huda beauty
rose gold texture - eyes shadow palette
and I'm taking the shade at sandalwood
right here it's like the perfect
transition shade so I'm gonna take a
really big blending brush and I'm just
gonna pop this in my crease I was in the
biggest rush when I was getting ready so
I was just like oh my god I just have to
do something really simple but it
actually turned out really nicely so I'm
excited to show you guys this brush is
amazing it is a what is this it is a
diffuse blender by the brand makeup
addiction the next color I'm taking is
the shade Hannah this is the perfect
warm brown shade so I'm gonna put this a
little bit lower than that last color to
warm up the crease and this brush is the
zoeva 2 to 8 brush and then of course
I'm going back in with that medium brown
shade I'm just gonna blend out the edges
it's very softly
the next thing I'm taking is the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow a
liquid I shudder I didn't realize how
actually easy this was to use like it's
been around for a while and I loved it
but then I stopped using it for a little
while but I'm back on the bandwagon so
I'm just gonna do a cup crease for this
one it's super easy you literally just
food and it's done
the next step is to go in with the heavy
metal glitter liner by urban decay this
stuff is literally the best I spoke
about this in my last video as you guys
know if you were watching five days of
shiny but I'm just gonna line like kind
of in the cut crease or where that line
is right there I just want a little bit
more variation would like color and
stuff so I'm going to load up my brush
and go into town next color I'm taking
is the shade moon dust I'm gonna use
this to highlight my brow bone so this
is gonna be a base for where we put the
gullet over the top
well not the base but like so you can
see the shim underneath still just a
touch then going in with my violet
Fawcett glitter glue I'm just gonna
stick a little bit of these little
glitters on my brow bone this is from
sapphire glitters and it's in rainbow
snar these are so pretty and like
iridescent they kind of had like a
grainy purple unicorn iridescent v love
it so I'll just put a little bit of the
glitter on the back of my hand and then
we can Pat the glue above the eyebrow
and clutters work in little small parts
at a time now time for the fun part
going in with that liquid liner and I'm
gonna do a winged liner so this one is
the tattoo liner I'm about how many
times can I say that by Kat Von D this
one's my fave but I think it is really
out so we'll see how this goes
all right now it's time for the full
slashes so I've just put a little bit of
a lash glue on the back of a pata
because I like to let it dry for at
least like five minutes so it's super
easy to apply so I'm using these lashes
on my go my tan I'm using lashes from
lash glorious and I'm just gonna pop
beats down let me fix the eyeliner
because this month's notice thick has
this one beautiful I actually can't
believe I just forgot to put mascara on
that is so weird I've never forgotten
that no it's time to go with the primer
so I'm taking the Urban Decay optical
illusion complexion primer I really have
a little baby one of these but I'm just
gonna put a few pumps on the back of my
hand and then we're gonna blend it all
over the face so you obviously want a
primer that's gonna make your makeup
stay on all day long if you're going to
a first of all when I went to the
festival the other day my makeup stayed
on all day so well and I think it just
comes down to me having like super dry
skin so my makeup holds it really well
and I don't sweat it off too much so I
guess I'm just lucky in that sense now
for the foundation I'm taking this one
from Natasha - Nonna it is the
foundation X full coverage fruit complex
this one's in the shade is all 50 medium
so I'm gonna give it a good shake
because I haven't used to in so long and
I'm gonna go into town I might have to
mix a few pumps with a lighter shade as
well this one's 30 this brush is zoeva
104 but her brush
then Cielo I'm going in with the
color pop nurse concealer in the shade
medium 30 I love this one so incredibly
much and it is super affordable as well
so we're just gonna go in and highlight
and conceal Walsh you're gonna highlight
the center of my face as well oh my god
that reminds me the one time I tried to
contour and oh it just looked like the
motto miner he's good time still I'm
really liking this foundation is it a
few times a little bit but it's totally
forgot about it just set my concealer
I'm taking the S bun loose face powder I
feel like this is from the brand cardi
everyone says up a link why does it say
that it just has the original formula if
you guys haven't tried that concealer
you totally should see this powder it's
stunning you don't always need expensive
makeup people every time I use the S on
palette it smells like cigarettes uh
stinks then to set my face I'm taking
the Rimmel stay matte powder I'm just
gonna Pat this all over my face to set
that foundation that foundation is
pretty matte there so I don't really
need to go really think that all just
going back in with that crease color I'm
gonna put that on my lower lash line
anything warm turn I'm obsessed with
then of course going in with mascara
this one is the benefit of roller lash
mascara and I need to put someone in my
top lashes because they totally totally
thought about that so this is just gonna
blend the real ones and the fake ones
together if you get a lot of smudging
under the eye when you end mascara you
can try and use a waterproof mascara
that works really well
the next thing I'm taking is the in your
dreams cosmetic glitter this one is in
the shade purple unicorn this is
actually my friends and she left it here
and I loved it so much I was gonna use
it in today's video sir I'm gonna take a
little bit of that glitter glue once
again put it all in the back of my hand
and then I really want to put this on
the inner corners because it's such a
beautiful glitter so I thought I'd use
different glitter
just kind of odd you know anymore kelex
festival so I'll just put this on my
unicorn ah and then I'm just gonna take
the other end of the brush and really
press it down because if I use the other
side the foundation and concealer and
stuff kind of gets on the color and it
changes it to like a nude which is not
what you want I feel like if you get
this in your eye it's gonna hurt so bad
I've done that at a festival before and
I was like super drunk but I was like oh
my god I can't see something's in my eye
it was the worst and it took so long to
get out I think my friends so which lip
heard my eyeball moving on to the rest
of the face we're gonna take this
Smashbox bronzer this is the bronze
light in the shade warm matte sir I love
contouring with warm shades it looks so
much better in my skin than cool tone so
I'm just gonna put this under my
cheekbone I always say Joe Byrne always
 it off I'm also gonna put this down
my neck as well I noticed in my last
video everyone was like oh literally
like going off at me for having ghillie
foundation hey you guys are used to that
by now like what do you mean my whole
collection is yellow no I do need to
like relax in the yellow I do it great
next up I'm gonna take the Bobbi Brown
illuminating bronzing powder in Bali
Brown 5 this one has like more shimmers
in it so I'm just going to I mean I use
this before but I'm just gonna put this
a little bit hide in that last shade
I love making my skin looks super bronzy
for festivals I mean all the time let's
be real so just put that on my
cheekbones and also around my forehead
as well and this brush is so good for
bronzer it is a stippling brush by zoeva
actually I don't think that's what it's
cold let's be real
oh my god reduce 1 to 5 and you can get
them at Sephora otherwise you can get
them online but I've been using these so
many years now next step is to set my
eyebrows I'm just using a clear brow gel
this is from benefit it's called the red
several fool by pushing them pretty much
directly upwards time for a little bit
of color on the cheeks I'm gonna take
this blush by zoeva in the shade and
burning up this is a beautiful coral I'm
just gonna put this on the apples and
then blend it back oh my gosh that is so
pigmented did not see that coming then
of course it's time for highlight so
this one's from our FRA I've never used
this one before
it's from the nikkietutorials collection
in the shade glow goals so it looks like
this it looks so beautiful I'm hoping
it's not true laughs me but we'll just
see how it goes I mean I didn't spec to
expect anything else from the key
tutorials and re from the birth
incredible but we'll put glitter over
the top anyways but I just wanted this
underneath so it peeks through don't
forget the tip you nurse I'm gonna go
back in with the in your dreams cosmetic
glitter in the shade unicorn no purple
unicorn and I'm just gonna put this
around here so it can kind of tie in
with the inner corner I'm excited so
again with violets vows on the back of
my hand and we can cut it on oh this is
no empty cuddly really finished a makeup
product usually I never do that's me you
know what's good I'm just gonna dab it
on with my finger and then go right in
that's so cute and I'm gonna do the
other side as well because I literally
always only put it on one side so bit
more extra today oh my bow just that
it's so good mm-hmm this is so fun
oh well that's like way too much the
last thing that I'm taking is the gem
mix this one's from sapphire glitters as
well so this has like little diamond
tees bigger ones there's Marines and
stuff in there so I'm just gonna put
this in this area right here to add even
more drama on the face so I'm just gonna
dock this right on and then take my
tweezers oh my god that's so cute I feel
like it just looks so much better when
you have small and big glitters on your
face at the same time or day Monte's
let's move on to the lips so with this
look I personally would do a nude but
you guys can do whatever you want this
is the joy wave long wear lip cream
liner in the shade see Jana is this
all-time Wow relax mmm then going in
with the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick in the shade
I have not used this in so long I'm
gonna put this all over my lips oh this
is so light and of course that you're
faced with a setting spray this one is
the Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray in a long lasting so I'm
gonna spritz this all over my face
oh god man that's really a long heat I
just put on a pink top because I feel
like this one matches this look a bit
more I feel like it's super girly so
next what I'm gonna do is go in with the
aura highlight once again and put this
on my shoulders to add some dimension up
here and also my collar bones and when
you're in the Sun this is going to look
amazing
so here we have the finished look I
really hope you guys liked it I actually
had so much fun creating this I don't
think I've ever done like a super
glittery look like this on my channel
before I haven't even done this much
glitter when I go to office for myself
so I hope you guys really enjoyed it and
if you did don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up and also subscribe to
my channel I honestly miss filming
videos every day so so much so what I'm
thinking is I'll do a wake up festival
looks if you guys would like that but
obviously I'd wait until we get closer
to festivals so let me know what you
think of that I love you and I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
