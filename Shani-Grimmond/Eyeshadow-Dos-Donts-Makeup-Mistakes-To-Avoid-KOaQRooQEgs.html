my channel so in today's video I'm doing
eyeshadow do and don't so I have done a
whole makeup do's and don'ts before if
you guys haven't seen that I will link
it down below and I did run over the
eyeshadow in that video but I want this
video to be like more in depth and I
want to talk about every single step
that I think is kind of like a makeup
mistake to kind of avoid obviously you
can do what you want I don't really care
what other people do with their makeup
but this is just tips that I found it's
super helpful and I thought I should
share them with you so let's go ahead
and get started
oh the first thing that you want to do
before applying any eyeshadow is going
in and priming your eyelids so there's
two reasons for this one the first one
being you're going to conceal any veins
that you may have on your eyelids I have
a lot especially when I raise my
eyebrows like this you can see them all
really well the second reason being it's
going to make the eyeshadow blend out a
lot easier the color is going to be more
pigmented and it's going to make your
eyeshadow last a lot longer so there is
two things you can use for eye primer
you can use your concealer and you can
tell that you have or just a basic eye
primer I used to use the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot to prime my eyes all the time
like for the past two years but recently
I've swapped over to concealer because I
feel like it's easier to blend into the
eye and it works just as well so
anything that works just as well that is
easier I'm going to do so on the do side
I'm going to go ahead and just pry my
eyes and then blend this in with my
finger I like to use my finger just so
it melts into my skin now going in with
any powder that you have that this is
the Rimmel stay matte I'm just going to
go ahead and set my primed eye this is
just going to make sure the concealer i
prime isn't wet anymore it's just going
to mattify it so all the colors that we
put on over the top blend out really
easily if you don't set it the eyeshadow
is just going to really stick to the wet
base so on the don't side I'm just going
to leave it all veiny now it's time to
start working on the transition shade so
the transition shade is the color that
you put right in your crease and this is
going to allow the other colors to blend
up easier into this shade and you don't
want any other colors to go past your
transition shades so I'm
use the eyeshadows from the barn palette
and I'm just going to take a medium
brown right here this is usually the
color that I put in my transition every
time I do my eyeshadow I just say I was
going for like a purple smokey eye then
I'd recommend putting like a lighter
purple in there so all of the darker
purples can blend upwards but most the
time I just like to put a brown in there
even if I was to have a random colored
eyeshadow look I just feel like Brown is
easy to work with so I hope that made
sense that was kind of confusing I'm
just going to put this in my crease
right here and blend it from inner
corner to outer corner this is also
going to add dimension to the eye as
well and the brush that I'm using is the
makeup studio s0 9 I really like this
one because it's really fluffy and it
just makes blending so so much easier
something else that I'd recommend doing
is just taking a little bit at a time
you don't want to go in with too much at
once because that's when it's going to
be really hard to blend it out and then
on the dirt side of course as I said
before you don't want to go in and play
a lot at a time oh my god I'm scared for
this because it is going to be quite
patchy and hard to blend out as you can
see right here I am going to exaggerate
all the don'ts so it is like more
obvious to see now it's time to add a
darker color in the crease so this one
is just going to go below the transition
shade it just here and it's going to add
a lot more dimension to your eyes it's
going to make them look a bit deeper I
have like really flat eyes so I love
this step so now I'm going in with this
chocolate brown shade right here on a
smaller blending brush and I'm just
going to go ahead and start from the
outer corner and slowly take it in
windshield wiper motions you just really
have to take your time with darker
shades another thing that I love to do
is go back in with a transition shade to
blend out any harsh lines from that
darker color just so it is a softer
blend upwards and I like to use a brand
new clean blending brush for this one
just start it a little bit now for the
don't side I'm going to go in with the
same brush that I use in the transition
to apply this color and I'm going to
take this dark shade right here and put
this
load the transition and you'll be able
to see that all the colors kind of blend
into one and you want to make sure not
to bring it too high up near the brow
otherwise probably going to look like
you got punched in the eyeball I like to
keep mine pretty low so when you look up
you can just see the darker shade
peeking at the top I always used to
clean my eyeshadow up with a q-tip and
that's just because I brought it out way
too far but if you guys don't want to
have that really sharp line like I don't
like that anymore
I would just recommend bringing the
black all of the blending just to about
here and stopping it there and if it
does come out a little bit as you can
see this side has a tiny bit you can
just go in with concealer and then with
a Beauty Blender just like Pat it so it
does have still a sharp line but it's
not as sharp as that now time for the
lip color so this one is pretty
straightforward
I can't think of a don't for this but I
just like to apply my lip color with my
finger because I just think it applies a
lot more pigmented and it is super easy
so I'm just going to pack this on my lid
what I like to do after I apply my lid
color is to go back in with that
transition shade on a small blending
brush and even maybe a little bit of the
crease color as well and I'm just going
to blend these two together right here
okay so when it comes to applying a
shimmer on the lid there are two ways
that you can apply it to make it really
intense so the first being a little
brush and a bit of fix+ and this is
going to really pick up all of that
shimmery product so it is this is the
one that I'm going to use today go
straight in and apply this and it's
going to be super pigmented another way
that you can apply it is straight from
your finger so rubber in and pack it
straight on and what I wouldn't
recommend is just taking like a fluffier
brush that is dry and applying that
straight on because it doesn't pick up
as much color and it comes off a little
bit more like flaky and you'll have a
lot more fallout I guess this looks good
if you want like a light application mmm
and something else that I don't like
through is put any shimmery shades above
my crease because that's just going to
make
skin look more textured I do have hooded
eyes as well so it's going to pick up
all of that sagginess so as you can see
up here all the skin just looks a lot
more flaky and dry I don't even know
what this like lump of color is I just
wanted to add it to show you how to
apply shimmer a lot easier that looks a
bit random now it's time for the lower
lash line so what I'm going to do for
the don't side is just going with that
darker shade that we put right in the
crease here carpo lot and put it from
inner corner to add a corner since my
eyes are really dark I like to kind of
stay away from putting any dark colors
under my lower lash line at least this
much because I look like a raccoon what
I'm going to do instead is take my lid
color and this one is going to go from
inner corner to outer corner so this one
is a bit lighter so it's going to look
on the bottle just realize I didn't do
my concealer and then on a cleaner
fluffy brush I'm going to take that
transition shade I can never say that
word properly transition shade I'm going
to put this underneath that maroon just
so we can blend it out a bit so it's not
too harsh and then if you do want to
smoke out your lower lash line you still
can of course so I'm just going to take
a really small flat definer brush and
I'm going to apply that really dark
brown really really close to my lower
lash line this is going to define the
lashes it's going to look gorge
now to highlight the brow bone I'm going
to take this shade from makeup geek and
I'm just going to lightly put this right
under my eyebrow for a subtle highlight
on the dudes side I tell off any excess
because she pigmented I like to use a
really small brush so the highlight
shade doesn't go too far down then I
like to go in with a little blending
brush and blend out any harsh lines just
very softly and then on the dirt side
I'm going to take a bigger brush and
just pack heaps on and we're not going
to blend this one out oh my god this is
tragic
now let's talk a black eyeliner in the
law
water line so I personally don't like to
apply black eyeliner in there just
because I feel like it closes the eyes
and I feel like it's too dark and like
rungy looking so on the don't side I'm
going to apply that in there I'm also
going to drag it down a little bit I'm
also going to apply this in this eye
right here but I'm going to show you how
I would do it to make it like more
wearable and blended now taking this a
matte black shade right here I'm going
to use this to blend out that eyeliner
that we just put on so it doesn't look
as harsh so I'm going to keep this
really really close to the lower lash
line we just want it to look a bit more
smoked out now it's time for the lashes
so I love big dramatic full lashes and I
feel like there's a way you can still
achieve that without blocking out your
whole eye shadow look so these are the
ones that I'm going to use on my do side
as you can see there's still little gaps
in them they're still nice and long but
you could definitely be able to see the
eye shadow through these on the don't
side I'm just going to take this really
big thick black pair when you put them
on the whole eye shadow is just
completely blocked out and it I just
feel like it doesn't look as good so
here we have the finished look as you
can see on this side right here it still
is very dark and dramatic and intense
but it is definitely just like well
wearable and softer as it has a nice
gradient to it and it is bit more
blended out so if you do this side
please don't take it personally I
honestly don't think it looks that bad
but anyways I hope you guys found this
video helpful if you liked it please
give it a big thumbs up and don't forget
to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already I love you so much and I
will see you in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
