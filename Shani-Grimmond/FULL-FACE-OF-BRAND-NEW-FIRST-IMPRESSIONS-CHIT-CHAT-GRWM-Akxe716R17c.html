before we get into this video I just
want to clarify that I'm a very aware
that I look like a boiled egg right now
like I do have hair it's just back here
so in today's video I'm going to be
trying out a bunch of new makeup I am so
excited because I honestly have so many
new products I didn't even know existed
they're all pretty much new so this is
gonna be a really fun one so let's go
ahead and jump right into the video okay
so the first thing that I always do
before I apply my makeup is a moisturize
my skin and right now as you can tell my
face is looking really really dull and
just it looks dead like honestly my face
looks like it needs a little bit of a
drink so I'm gonna go in with the
Dermalogica calm water gel this stuff is
incredible especially if you have
sensitive or dry skin so I'm just gonna
put a nice little dollop on the back of
my hand so this like helps protect your
skin from like the dust outside and just
all that gross stuff flying in the air
so if your skin is sensitive at all this
is perfect and my skin literally drinks
this up like it's water I love this as
well because it's kind of like a gel
formula so it just feels really
comfortable and super light on the face
if you guys are looking for a really
nice like everyday moisturizer I would
definitely recommend this look look at
my face right now now it's time for the
eyebrows so you guys can be nice and
closer this one is the iconic London
sculpt and Bruce eyebrow cushion I've
seen literally everyone talked about
this so I want to see if it's as good as
what everyone's saying sir I think this
shade might be a little bit too dark for
me it's in the shade deep and I don't
think my brows are this dark but this is
what it looks like here it is super like
wet and I don't know I just don't know
how I'm gonna feel about this let's just
find out so I always like to start by
defining my arch wow it's very very very
wet
which means easy to make mistakes like
super easy I really don't like the way
that looks at all it just looks like
really choppy around the edges because
it was so wet and now it's just like
drying up the new eyeshadow palette that
I have is from a two-faced it's called
the chocolate gold palette first of all
this packaging hand steady this
packaging is incredible I am obsessed
with this is probably my favorite Too
Faced chocolate bar kind of like palette
sorry this is well in terms of packaging
this is what all of the colors look like
I think it has a really nice selection
in here there's definitely a lot of
different bold and we still have like a
few transition colors we have a black
which is always nice and then we have
like a nice Raburn highlight shade this
one's matte by the way I don't know
there's just so many unique colors like
this one's like a bluey Silva that's
really pretty I love this grain oh my
god and then of course it's like a true
goal there's a bronze I really like this
one here I don't there's just a lot of
colors in here that I would actually use
the only thing is which it's not a bad
thing I'm just saying there's only like
to kind of like transition shades right
here so this is the only two colors that
you can use with all of these shimmery
shades I'm gonna start by using this
shade so bougie love that name and then
we're gonna blend that into the crease I
really know what color I want to do in
the lid but this one's kind of a light
shade so I'm just gonna pack it in my
lid so we can start out the transition
and of course the next shade I'm gonna
take is cocoa truffle the other
transition shade so I'm gonna put that a
little bit lower than the last color to
deepen it up you guys know the drill so
I'm just gonna look down and start on
the outer half and kind of just blend it
all the way into the inner corner oh
this is the one that's not so sure I've
chocolate like what do you mean just
want yeah if you guys haven't seen my
last vlog you have to go watch it if you
want to see what I'm like drunk just go
watch it and skip to the end it's so
funny I'm so annoying
I just don't stop screaming I didn't
realize until I finished editing I'm
like wow is that what I'm like all the
time and I'm like yeah that's what I'm
like all the time because I'm always
like screaming like that like I just
don't
well this colors building up really
nicely as well just like the other shade
it's it's building up super dark when I
layer it you know what third I never do
black eye shutters sorry I'm gonna take
the shade decadent
let's look meanwhile to read that one
and I'm just gonna see how pigmented the
black is oh my god this brush is wet no
it's not okay well that was close that
could have been bad and I'm just gonna
put that on the outer third of my eyelid
I feel like they look so great with
black eyeshadow but like whatever I'm
just gonna put a tiny bit on
the next color that I'm taking is the
shade love and cocoa I didn't realize
how shimmery all of these colors are
Neely but they are just so sparkly like
I'm really excited to use this one I'm
just gonna go in with a flat shader
brush but I'm gonna wet it with a little
bit of fix+ first just because I want
this to be like a foiled eyeshadow
you're not just like and eye shadow the
next thing that we have is actually
really really cool sorry it is the oh
wow there's so much stuff from don't my
Gillett okay this is the glitter pop
peel off eyeliner so we have four colors
right here there's this black with gold
chunks a really nice lilac purple of
gold and like a bronzy pinky kind of
shade so I feel like this one would be
the best for this look oh okay cool so
it's like a rosy pink with like flecks
of gold in it oh wow that's stunning
have a keys can I just say there who's
actually gonna peel off their eyeliner
like that's weird oh my god that is
sorry vibrant I'm really happy with this
I don't know why what I'm just imagining
Michael like screaming in my face right
now saying like don't it up David
yeah you better it up okay so as
you can see this side is a really good
it is too pigmented it had like a really
nice tip so it created a shop line well
it was easy to create a shop line with
it on this side I kind of stuffed it up
and I couldn't make it as shops or I had
to like keep layering it and layering it
next up I'm going in with the benefit a
bad gal bang at mascara now let me just
tell you this better be good because
they flew us to the Maldives for the
launch of this mascara it took them four
years to create like the perfect formula
for this one so I think that's super
cool it has to be a magazine I did put
it on my lower lashes the night of the
event like after it launched because I
had no idea what it was gonna be so I
put lash like fake lashes on so
obviously I couldn't really test it out
probably because I already had like a
full face of makeup on but I'm super
excited to see how this one goes
so I remember them
saying that there's like little I'm
gonna have to like double check this but
there's like little fibers in this
mascara that is used in astronaut
outfits or like nine outfits in space so
what keeps see lashes lifted and light
that's what I can remember I was super
drunk white not telling me about oh I
really like the wand it's super flexible
as well I'm just gonna wiggle oh well
you know wiggle with the mascara from
the root we're good
I actually think I'm gonna have a new
famous car like not just saying that
because I'm on a trip I would never last
you guys ever but I'm really liking it
wow my lashes look she look like spider
legs that's exactly what I want this
literally is the weirdest formula ever
like not in a bad way in a really good
way I have never used a formula like
this ever it is so light and like my
lashes my individual lashes are staying
like still spread out but that's just I
don't know it's just like okay time for
the false lashes this one is from the
brand desire lashes these honestly look
incredible the packaging is so cute as
well oh my god these lashes are
incredible but the eyeliner is tailing
off on this side now the Dermalogica
moisturizer is all settled into my skin
we can move on to the foundation so this
one is the Fanta Beauty Pro filter
foundation I have tried this plenty of
times before but I have the wrong shade
in my face always was so Orange and I
was like stuff this I'm just not gonna
use anymore so we have three shades here
we have 260 270 and 250 so there's a
bunch of different undertones different
shades from like super light to super
dark so I'm really happy about that
because obviously you guys know I'm just
showing you guys now it was a little
drama with the taut what is it it is
like the matte shape tape and the Jewish
shape tape
and when I was doing my review I'm
pretty sure I was the first person on
YouTube to do that review I didn't look
at the shade range from now on I will
look at the shade range when I'm
reviewing foundations because obviously
that's like a massive part of a
foundation and you know if it's worth
recommending so I'm really happy that
this one does have a really large shade
range for pretty much everyone but I'm
really sorry if I offended anyone by not
mentioning the shade range with the
Tarte foundation from now on I'm gonna
be researching my ass off and I will
find out if there's a shade range for
everyone otherwise I do not want to
recommend it at all because that is so
wrong on so many levels and I think all
brands should cater to everyone's skin
type tone undertone everything I just
don't think there's any excuse like at
all so I'm not gonna be using the Tarte
foundation again just because if there's
gonna be shade range for like light to
medium skin tones and what like three
foundation shades for people with a
deeper skin tone then that's just not
good enough
so unless they're coming out with more
shades which I heard they are then maybe
I'll use it but you know and I'm gonna
blend it in with my damp Beauty Blender
I'm just so excited to like cover all
these pimples cuz I'm so over them
honestly I always go over my lips
because they're so freakin red all the
time it's kind of hard to build this
foundation up just because it does dry
so quickly but it does have a nice
medium coverage which I'm really happy
about it is very matte okay so now for
the concealer a new one that I have here
is from BH Cosmetics it is called the
Studio Pro concealer total coverage
concealer okay so apparently it's really
full coverage we have the shade a111
n105 so one's more of like a neutral
shade ones move like a highlighting
shade so I think I'm gonna go in with a
neutral shade first I mean this spread
is super affordable so I don't really
know what to expect I have tried some
really affordable concealers that are
amazing nicer
mmm it's kind of like really dry or is
it the foundation oh my god it's like so
dry next up we have the Patrick Starr
what is this even called Patrick's
powder it is a setting powder I'm so
excited to bake my face with this
because he is like the queen of baking
so I'm assuming that this is gonna be
incredible
even with a wok EOS concealer well the
color is like very different it's kind
of like a pinky beige rose shade Oh
melts into the skin it's straight away
well it kind of reminds me of the lip
lip Prairie pad of like the really
expensive one I don't even need to dust
it away that's the main thing okay I'm
gonna go ahead and set my face and I'll
be right back because I don't have a new
paddle let's go ahead and finish the
lower lash line so I'm just gonna go in
with this shade at cocoa truffle this
deep brown and I'm just gonna take that
from outer corner to inner corner I
don't want to do anything dramatic I
just want it even out under the eyes and
by the way the base is not looking bad
at all well my face need some serious
bronze our lucky that's what we're about
to do so I'm going in with this one from
a tree face it is their new chocolate
gold Soleil at bronze I'm so excited for
this it says gilded bronze are made with
a 100% natural cocoa powder and real
gold wow they must have real golden like
everything of there you go collection
but this is what it looks like right
here it has like little gold flecks in
it which I'm super excited about because
bronzes are my favorite like product
when it comes to makeup I love using
like white head brushes because you can
really see if it's like pigmented oh my
god okay so it's one of those okay so
you've really got to have a light hand
with this product that's for sure and
make sure you set your face like set
your foundation if you're gonna use this
product as well because it does clean
some areas it's like still a little bit
wet I don't know what happened to my
other give me Sun by Mac but I mean I
lost it but this is like one of my
all-time faves it's more of like an
orangey shade then the other one the
other ones like more brownie ashy that's
weird
I'll really use it again like for sure I
love the shimmers in it but we just need
a bit of orange on the face a bit of a
sunkissed glow you know now it's time
for the blush so we have this little
jewelry here by Joey I absolutely adore
this brand everything in their range is
super luxurious and such high quality so
this blush joy is in the shade adore me
and hold me I love this one right here I
think I'm just gonna go ahead and mix
the true colors together if you do have
a deeper skin tone this one is really
pretty especially this color here I
don't really like really dramatic Pink's
like that on me personally I'm just
gonna take my bronzer brush and put it
on the apples of my cheeks and blend it
back
I just think blush adds such a nice
healthy glow to the face like never skip
blush what are you doing the moment
we've all been waiting for
okay highlighter this one is the true
face okay I swear this video is not
sponsored my two face like okay
it doesn't actually say what it's called
which is when but it looks like this it
is super iridescent it has like green
purple blue it has all these different
shade balancing off the pearlescent
vibes of it I'm I'm very excited for
this so we're gonna use it without a
without any fixed plus first just to see
how it goes oh it's a stupid purple oh
my god hey it's like legit purple like a
lavender purple well that's really cool
that's one of those highlighters that I
think would be really good for like
festivals but like I don't want to be
wearing this like every day you know
anybody who's like let's just not my
vibes I like champagne e gold vibes okay
so we have a different one here this is
the Bobbi Brown highlighter in the shade
bronze glow oh this is what I call
heaven this is such a beautiful shades
I'm just gonna put this over the top and
oh my god Purple's like not going so we
have some products here from Smashbox
they have two what are these liquid
lipsticks or we have got a light and
fair games
this one's more of like a brown that got
a lot and then games more of like a
pinky nude um I'm gonna try got a lot
first I'm not gonna lie that applicator
is literally perfection like that makes
applying a really neat lip so easy I am
actually so in love with this color and
the formula I've I think I've found a
new formula like new fave formula like
whoa okay I'm gonna go in the lightest
shade just in the middle just cuz it is
really Brown look for this look and I
haven't done a nice ombre lip in a while
okay so I just went to the efforts all
but straightening my hair I feel so much
better when my hair's actually done I
never squeeze me I never can be bothered
to do my hair but what I do it I'm like
wow I should do it Laura and so I really
hope you guys enjoy that this makeup
look I had so much fun creating it okay
so let's have a little rundown I
actually really do enjoy the foundation
I just don't like how it dried so
quickly but yeah I think it does look
really nice if my face looks nice and
like healthy and just like it's not true
thick it just looks super light on my
face um even though I have so much
makeup on I love the eye shadows they
worked so well I didn't like the eyebrow
product the lip product was incredible
wasn't a fan of the highlight the first
one the bronzer was actually alright but
you definitely need to use that as like
a layering product and I adored the
blush so so much make sure you guys give
this video a massive thumbs up if you
enjoyed it I love you so much and I'll
leave all the products that are used in
today's video down in description below
