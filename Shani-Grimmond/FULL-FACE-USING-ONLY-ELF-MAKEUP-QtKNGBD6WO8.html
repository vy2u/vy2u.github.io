in today's video I'm going to do a one
brand on elf cosmetics I went shopping
yesterday and spent $200 on every single
product so the whole face for a full
glam I'm hoping it's only a full glam
I'm not too sure because I don't really
know how else products work I don't
really have too many in my collection
already hence why I had to buy
everything
this was $200 for all of this
but when you think about it when you go
to like a high-end shop you're going to
be spending $200 for like three products
so that is very good value well I hope
it's good value for what I have I have
so many products so let's go ahead and
jump into the link-up Cecilia starting
with the brows I'm going to take this
little jewel this is in the shade and
medium so we have a wax on one side and
a powder I'm just going to use the
powder
I'm hoping it's dark enough or maybe I
can just do white brows today so let's
see how this goes oh my god what did
that just happen real late first
impression as soon as I put it on it was
pavement hood which is a good sign yes
so here's what be before and up it looks
like I would give this one a thumbs up I
am pretty happy with it
it's pigmented easy to apply it is a
little bit more like a chocolate warm
tone than my natural eyebrow but that's
what I usually use anyway so very
impressed I'm going to clean up
underneath my eyebrow I'm going to take
this highlight and concealer duo so I'm
just going to take the concealer side
and fix up underneath the brows to make
it nice and clean I will be making a
video as well with affordable brushes so
keep an eye out for that one but for now
I'm just using my new brushes which are
multi and one Mac one literally that's
all I really like this for carving out
the brows it is a really good job I'm
just a bit nervous to see how it goes as
an eye primer I'm going to use that same
product to conceal the eyes I'm not sure
if is we're going to have a little
pigment in it we'll see the formulas
look very wet so it doesn't have a lot
of coverage but it definitely did
Brattain the eyelid and it got rid of
some of the veins I'm going to take this
under eye setting powder I think that's
what's cool it doesn't say it on any of
the products what they're called but
this is what it looks like I'm just
going to use this to set that concealer
down so it's not tacky otherwise -
shudder is going to twist so bad oh I
really like to start off lifting
everything matte and it's so silky for
the eye show there's a few different
things that I'm going to use in
Australia well at least the shop that I
went to there wasn't much of a range of
the eyeshadows so I'm going to use the
sunglasses sunkissed glow
bronzer as my transition I also have a
few other brothers and I have one
eyeshadow palette right here but just
because the colors want what I wanted I
am going to like mix and bronzes in
there as well starting with this one
right here I'm just going to take this
on a blending brush and blend it into my
crease this is just going to add some
warmth in there
okay we're gonna have to build this up
okay I couldn't find a contour shade in
the elf collection either so that would
have worked better in the crease because
this one does have like a few shimmers
in it but we're just working with what
we have
I'm just going to take this little
eyebrow viewer again and take the powder
and put this like right in my crease to
deepen up because it's not adding enough
color I wish they had eyeshadows there
just keep going back in and adding more
on until you have enough steps in there
and then for the lip color I'm taking
this palette which is called a happy
hour and I'm going to put this shader
all over my lid so it looks like we're
going for a cool trailer today cool
first I'm just going to spray some of
this and makeup mist and set on my brush
just to make sure it's pigmented oh I
think hey I'm dark matte bag let's just
hug her on okay I've never had this much
fallout in my life so make sure if you
are using the elf eyeshadows you do your
eyes first otherwise you're gonna ruin
your makeup so I'm just going to go over
to wipe and clean up the fallout I am
going to moisturize my face just because
my skin is really dry I don't know if
elf has moisturizers work just quickly
I'm not mad with how this eye shadow
turned out it's definitely not intense
but with what we work to it I think they
did a pretty good job so I'm going to go
in with dehydrating a face primer as I
said I do have a PM source this is
exciting
oh I'm just using the elf stippling
brush as well it looks like a very low
light consistency
now it's time for foundation so I'm
using this oil-free foundation with SPF
15 I have a shade of buff so let's see
if I should apply this with a beauty
blender or a kabuki brush yeah I would
say a kabuki brush just because it is a
little bit thicker let's do this
Wow so looks very full coverage like
first impression I like the color as
well it's matching my fake tan pretty
nicely I just put a fresh sheet pan on
it's a very wet formula so I might have
to go in with a Beauty Blender just to
pick up any excess foundation that's not
really blending in I'm just going to
take the Beauty Blender with the more
foundation over my nose because it
wasn't really full concealer I'm using
this one right here in the shade light I
thought this was like a full size
concealer and I took it out and I was
like this because I got what let's go in
with this underneath the eyes to
brighten it up a little bit give this a
some dimension
hopefully cover those bags well
explosion I'm just going to blend this
in with my TV bundle seems to be
covering look bad at all so I'm just
going to go in with that highlight and
concealer and just put a little bit of
the concealer right here so we can
highlight that area a little bit because
the other one wasn't the lightest and it
was a like lighter shade so that's a
little bit disappointing color range
isn't the best or maybe that's just what
they have in Australia or the one I went
to now I'm just going to go back in with
that under eye setting powder and just
lightly dab this under my eyes but
before we do that gotta get rid of those
creases because it's creasing quickly
did you set down creases then I'm going
to go to trust me I'm really hoping that
this doesn't have flash back in it but
I'm just going to set right under here
I'm not going to bring it down to 5 just
in case I like what I see it's not
leaving a white cast at all under my
eyes to set the rest of the face I'm
going to take this pressed powder in the
shade
caramel and I have a feeling it might be
a little bit to relax me but at least
you can get rid of that really dewy look
shiny oily whatever you want to call
that all right let's go back in with
that eyebrow powder underneath the eyes
just some outer corner to inner corner
and then I'll take this bronzer again
and just take that underneath the last
color we put on and then for that inner
corner highlight I'm going to pick up
this shade or right here on a pencil
brush go on in oh that's pigmented oh I
did put that mist on there as well so it
would show up now let's go in with
mascara I really like the look of this
wand because it is plastic so let's see
how gory it's making the lashes black
but I wouldn't say it's really adding
much volume the formula is just like not
wet enough now it's time for the lashes
I had to trim these a lot they're really
long so make sure you measure them up so
these are literally the smallest lashes
I've ever applied but it definitely
looks better than not having lashes on
so now let's move onto the bronzer I'm
going to take this little quad right
here called golden and I'm going to pick
up these two shades and run to my face
I'm going to put this underneath my
cheekbones oh my god this is so shimmery
what the hell I really don't like how
that looks on my skin it looks like mud
with sheer in it so I'm going to try and
go in with this one and fix it out but
you know there's no going back now
now it's time for blush I'm taking this
one in the shade peachy keen and coming
up on the cheekbones all my gosh my face
is literally so glowy that one's not
adding enough color so I'm going to take
this one in the shade twinkly pink and
hopefully this adds a flush of color to
my cheeks because there's literally no
color there just taking that dark around
I'm just going to put that where I would
control not that I've ever gone toward
shimmer shade before but as I said we're
working with what we had okay yeah now
example highlighter even though we're
already glowing so I'm using Anastacio
eight pick 23 brush and I'm going to
spray that stuff on though brush again
and the highlighter that I'm using is in
the shade of moonlight pearls so I did
it here money talking about this thing
it was really bad I guess I can still
see it though like there's a little bit
there so let's do it looks like
otherwise I do you have a backup um
are you seeing what I'm seeing this
looks amazing now it's time for the lips
so I have a red and a purple I'm not
going with the purple just because I
never do travel with will that's a
significant finish to makeup look I just
threw in some contacts and my little
hoops so I'm actually really impressed
with how it turned out except for the
contouring bronzing area just because
that's not working for me all of that
shimmer it just looks a little bit silly
and I couldn't warm up my face and also
if I had a contour bronzer I feel like
this would look so much better but I
feel like the lipstick is really
pigmented the eyeshadow was pretty good
everything was like pretty good for its
price I just don't think I had all the
products that I needed sir make sure you
guys leave down below what other one
friend tutorials you want me to do I
feel like these are photo ones are so
much fun just to see like what you can
come up with and like how hard it is
because sometimes it is a little bit
hard with a really cheap products but
overall I'm pretty impressed and I
really hope you guys like this video
give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel I love you and I'll see you
very soon goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
