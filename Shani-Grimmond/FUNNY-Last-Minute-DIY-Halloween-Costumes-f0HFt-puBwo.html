channel so in today's video we are doing
for last-minute Halloween costumes and
they are all pretty funny well lift in
my opinion I am super excited for this
video Halloween is just around the
corner in Australia I don't feel like we
celebrate as much as like Americans or
anything like that but for all my
viewers that want to celebrate Halloween
and haven't bought a costume yet this
videos for you because most things in
this video you'll probably find laying
around the house or things that are
really easy to get a hold of you can
blow off your friends whatever sorry
yeah I hope you guys like this video and
let's jump into it and if you couldn't
tell already just gone little fine okay
so let's dive in with my favorite outfit
we are going to be Regina George from
Mean Girls so I started out by a cunning
little circles where your nipples would
be and I realized what was bigger than
the other that's okay so pretty much my
whole entire outfit is from Target the
sports bra the singlet and this school
kids skirt with little black pants
underneath because my god that skirt was
so short obviously because it is a kids
size i pair the outfit with a pair of
black heels and I think this looks
really cute I'm literally obsessed yeah
girl that is so fetch oh my god Gretchen
stop trying to make fetch happen it's
not going to happen
Hey
guess who I am so I'm just taking a red
lipstick and over drawing my lips so I
can be the one and only Miranda sings
this one is so incredibly easy it takes
two seconds to dress up as Miranda sings
of course you want to go ahead and get
two bobby pins and pin your fringe back
and you're gonna look so hot let me tell
you you have to like a nail all those
facial expressions and that's pretty
much what's going to make you look like
her so my top is from my boyfriend's
covered how convenient is that if you
don't have a top like this you can go to
like Target or Kmart they are pretty
cheap there and I made sure to do all of
the buttons up especially the one it
right at the top
my pants are well my pajama pants
they're from cotton on body I pulled
them up really high so we have a nice
camel toe how stunning is that this
would have to be one of my favorite
looks ever like come on it's amazing
okay so I want you guys to pause this
video right now and go in the comments
below and what do you think this is
because Jonathan didn't find it funny
but I've had it freaking hilarious I
mean Michael were cracking up for ages
so this is a spice rack I'm trying to
tape the spices on my boobs
I'm trying to glue it on my boobs
nothing works oh you know what I just
shoved it in my cleavage you can get
double-sided tape as well so it doesn't
move if you are like you know going
trick-or-treating or something like that
but I just thought this was like
literally bit easiest thing ever it's
kind of lazy just shoving spices down
there so I'm just gonna get some glitter
glue then I'm just going to go ahead and
chuck some spices on my face like you
know just spice things up a little if
you know demain hum hum
I really hope I'm not the only one who
thinks this one's funny I'm actually
like ruffling like literally ruffling
again this sports bra is from cotton on
body and I'm wearing these cute little
black high-waisted pants from chic I am
obsessed with them they are so classy so
now it's time to move on to the next
look and we're gonna be a boxer so first
thing I'm going to do is take some
purpley brown eyeshadow and I'm gonna
make it look like I've been punched in
the eye a bit of a bruise there so I'm
just taking a fluffy blending brush and
taking this in like the natural eye bag
socket area and just blending that in
then taking some thick clotted blood I'm
just going to Pat this around my mouth
of the sponge of course if you guys
don't have any blood you can just use
like tomato sauce or make your own
concoction of blood then I'm just going
to take some liquid blood and pull that
from my mouth and just dab it in so it
looks realistic and messy and I'm pretty
impressed with how this turned out to be
honest you want to make sure your hairs
up because if you're getting into a
fight you don't want your hair ripped
out now it's time to pop some gloves on
these ones are from super a mart
sometimes I like to go upstairs and do
some boxing but not today because we're
mucking around today hung may do a
little bit dress up these pants are for
my friend I just borrowed them there
he's like keep boxing pants but of
course you don't have any of those but
you probably don't you can just wear any
gym clothes but as long as you have
those boxing gloves with your gym
clothes on you'll be all sweet so um as
you can see I've got a lot of experience
with boxing like look at me go I
honestly don't know how I had this much
energy I don't even know I didn't even
have breakfast what's happening this is
me trying to be scary as well what's
happening not sure hon
ok so now we have all the Halloween
costumes as you can tell very very
simple literally is going to take you
five seconds to do um this is for anyone
that's lazy like me okay because I'm not
going to be spend $80 on Norma Halloween
cash join me if you like this video
please give it a big thumbs up because
it helps me out so so much I love you
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
