so in today's video I'm gonna be doing
my makeup in a way that makes it look
like I've had a face surgery so in no
way shape or form and my promoting
surgery at all when I got my boobs done
I did that for me and I never promoted
it to you guys I just simply shared my
experience with you and my message will
never change if you want to do something
with your body go ahead and do it if you
don't that's perfectly fine as well so
don't let anyone else's opinions
determine what you want to do so we're
just going to be having a little bit of
fun makeup washes off at the end of the
day so don't take this too seriously
because I know a lot of people take
everything really seriously these days
so I was inspired to do this video by
Christian Dominique so I'll leave her
video down below if you guys want to see
it but let's go ahead and jump right
into the meal okay just tell me I cannot
because it's so hot in Brisbane it's
literally steaming when I walk outside I
feel like I'm melting into the floor and
appropriate sir as you can see I changed
my background I feel like the old
background was like discussing like what
was I even thinking it I don't area but
this one's a lot better in cleanup so
I'm happy about that so the first thing
that I'm going to do is my eyebrows so
I'm gonna take the Gobbo and Kelly brow
pomade I have a shade of cocoa so what
I'm gonna do with this is really make a
high arch my brow it's gonna make the
brows look like I've had a bit of a you
know bit of Botox in there pulled them
up nice and high so I'm just going to
use an angled brush firstly I like to
brush through my brows do you tangle
those little bump fluff heads you know
how it is using a brow pomade is
honestly the easiest way for a really
really defined brow story I'm just gonna
make my arch nice and high fake it till
you make it hon I'm never gonna make it
cuz I'm never gonna get it over I live
but this is always easy because it
washes off doesn't hurt
I also like to extend my route just a
little bit and I'm trying not to draw
too much underneath my brow I'm gonna
make a nice - fine line but I'm not
gonna pull it down too much because I
want the brows will appear nice and high
I'm just gonna lightly fill in the front
next up I'm going in with concealer I'm
taking the heart shape tape in the shade
at lights and I use this all time but
what I'm gonna do is pop this all over
my lid and also carve out under my brows
so it is nice and defined if I ever skip
this step of carving out my brow it
looks so messy I love doing this so what
I like to do after that is just drag
down the concealer onto here pull that
down so then we can blend it all out
over the lid without messing up what
we've done my face looks so red now that
I promise it's like around here it's
scary I'm just gonna go in with my mock
Jakob said but Runza in the shade
tantric this is the our makeup run so
I'm just gonna pop this in my crease and
it's gonna give the effect of like a
deep ha
suck it especially if you keep the brow
bar nice and highlighted that's pretty
much all with the I show I'm gonna do
I'm just gonna drag it out softly out
here so you can give the illusion of
like yeah I kind of coming up this way
this is seriously the best blending
brush it is from it's cool the diffuse
blended by makeup addiction I don't even
know who is this brush is honestly like
I just found it in my makeup kit and I
was like oh ho like that okay so let's
move on to the face and we'll go back to
the eyes soon sir I'm gonna take the tot
clean slate timeless smoothing primer
this is gonna make the face look super
super smooth so I'm just gonna pop this
and mainly on my like on the center of
my face just when my pool is a big it
just like literally mix and vanish it's
great and then I just like to go in with
the urban decay at vitamin infused
complexion prep priming spray this stuff
is so refreshing on the face
and I like to go in with foundation on
my lip so I'm just gonna take off the
lip balm and this is just so the color
that you put on like as a lipstick or
whatever is the really treater color and
it's not distracted by like the red now
that my face is nice and dry I'm going
in with foundation so this one is the
hourglass vanish stick and the only show
that I have left is in the shade nude
and it actually works pretty well for me
I just need to put a bit of bronzer
running stuff to make it match my neck a
little bit more but this is a really
really good foundation it just has like
a beautiful finish that's so easy to
apply
just you're on strokes and it's great
and it covers all of my pimples which is
amazing but it does have flash back so I
wouldn't recommend wearing this at
nighttime at all
let me be real right now took photos the
other day and my face was so pale I'm
just gonna blend this in I'm using my
zoeva buffer brush this is honestly the
best brush to blend out like thick
foundations this is where it gets tricky
because I don't want to go over the arch
of my eyebrow you have to be super
careful no it's time to go in and
conceal the eyes so I'm taking the Becca
Apple luminous perfecting concealer I
have this shade at fair so I'm just
gonna pop this underneath my eyes to get
rid of any of those purple tones this
one is nice and hydrating as well so
it's great I think it's only empty and
I'm just gonna blend that out with my
Beauty Blender
this is the best blend out concealer
with FYI
you can already see how much better that
looks now that's all one tone under
there okay so now to go in with a really
light concealer I'm gonna put this on my
chin so this area that kind of comes out
a bit more and also right here I'm gonna
put a little bit on my cheekbones as
well to make them appear a little bit
higher and then also down my nose to
make that a pair of bit slimmer so it
depends on what shake nose you guys have
that will determine what you're gonna do
the concealer but because my nerves it's
quite small but it is it's not wide but
I mean it could be like you know I'm
just going to do that to my parents of a
really thin nicer I'm just going to
lightly Pat over my nerves to second
nice job of cheek fell off now it's time
to con to us I'm taking this a Bobby
Brown a cream foundation this one's in
the shade 6.5 oh my god
bubble of my fur over I mean I put this
on my Beauty Blender just because if I
go straight on my face it tends to take
off a little bit of my foundation so I'm
just gonna put this right underneath my
cheekbone to give the illusion of deeper
cheeks
beautiful and then we're gonna blend it
upwards not downwards I find this very
satisfying I'm also gonna put that
around my forehead as well so it looks
like a bit of a shudder around there
it'll make their forehead appear a bit
smaller as well don't blend that out
into my Helen I'm also gonna take this
on my jaw bone as well to make that look
a little bit more defined under my chin
see you later double chin okay so now to
set the face I'm taking the s-bahn a
loose face powder and I'm just gonna use
that to bake underneath my eyes this one
is super affordable pretty good so I'm
just gonna bake underneath my eyes and
then to set the rest of my face I'm
taking the Australian flawless powder in
the shade medium tan this one is super
super full coverage so you like be
careful I'm just going to put this down
I don't want to disturb what's on my
face underneath sir I'm kind of just
like padding down instead of a swiping
it around
okay so just quickly I'm gonna go ahead
and set my brows with the benefit gimme
brow this one's in the shade at three so
I'm just gonna push my brows
upwards to make them look a bit thicker
oh it sure is nice I feel like someone's
like you're having a party outside of my
door like it's so loud out there so for
the lower lash line I'm going in with
that same Marc Jacobs bronzer and I'm
just gonna pop this from outer corner
all the way to inner corner just kind of
even out the I should it look a little
bit and then I'm going in with the Stila
eyeliner in the shade of Alpine so this
is a white eyeliner and I'm gonna put
this in my waterline because it's really
gonna give the appearance of a like
bigger brighter eye I mean I personally
have very little beady eyes so this is a
great little trick next step is eyeliner
and this one honestly makes the biggest
illusion that your eyes are kind of
going whoop out this way so this could
honestly bro in my whole makeup look
because I'm so bad at winged liner so I
don't know how this is gonna go but I'm
gonna try anyway I did the other day and
I actually forget what product I used
but it turned out pretty good sir I'm
gonna go in with the Maybelline hyper
sharp winged eyeliner it's got glitter
all over it I'm gonna need a lot of
concentration for this I'm scared
okay it's legit me in 20 minutes and
I've somewhat created true uneven wings
if you've never seen uneven wings before
now you have hello I'm Shani welcome to
my channel I'm never gonna have perfect
wings so I'm gonna go in with the bobbi
brown smokey eye mascara and I'm gonna
Curt my top and bottom lashes so I'm
just gonna start from the root and
really work that mascara wand in there
so they're all nice and black then it's
time for the lower lashes sorry I want
to make these babies nice and long I'm
gonna cover up all of that white
chunkiness in there from the eyeliner
now it's time for the false lashes I'm
so excited to apply these ones so these
ones are from Holy Grail in his style up
princess or I'm gonna have to go ahead
and screamy them just a little bit
because they are pretty long like the
band's nice and all these lashes are
perfect because the end of them asks you
belong and they go a little bit shorter
so it makes the eyes look good nice and
cat eyed beautiful in my opinion that
lashes make everything look 20 times
better it's just so much more volume oh
my god alright let's move on to
contouring the face so I'm gonna go in
with the Marc Jacobs what is this
Mirage filter and it's in the shade at
40 so this one has a highlight and a
contour shade in here so that supercool
tone and I'm gonna use this to highlight
under the eyes so we can accentuate all
of that concealer we put on so let's go
ahead and start with the highlighting so
I'm just gonna take a tapered brush and
just lightly dab this under my eyes so
we can create a nice little illusion
under there make that feel like it's
kind of sticking out a little bit more
make the cheekbones look a bit higher go
through in between my brows and on my
chin then I'm going in with the contour
shade I'm just gonna take a small amount
nothing seems to be coming on my brush
I'm just gonna pop this right where I
put that cream contour to make it even
more dramatic that's looking pretty good
and then I'm also gonna take this around
my temples as well so that looks pretty
good don't want to go too crazy you
still have to go in with bronzer then
taking the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer
I'm just gonna use this to kind of runs
up my whole face this one's more of like
a warm tone so it's a lot softer on the
face I feel like it's not that was a she
like the contouring shades then going in
with that lighter shade again I'm just
gonna take this right under here so then
the bronze that looks a little bit
deeper even though it's already so
dramatic like what do you mean now I'm
going in with this a blush from ephra
this one's in the shade at Bellini and
it's gonna make the cheeks look a little
bit more full a bit because I'm gonna
put that on the apples and then blend it
back oh my god this is the best brush to
some morphe M five-30
just just makes the face food more
healthy as well while we're at it
Gorge I'm so annoyed there when I
ordered everything of art vanilla when I
ordered everything off Oh fry came in
pans like this knows that I want water
mom now going in with that bronzer once
again I'm just gonna take this down the
edges of my nerves just because my nurse
is kind of why this is gonna make it
look a little bit more narrow so I'm
just contouring on the edges of my
nerves I guess it kind of just depends
on what shape nerves you have and what
you want to do to it but I'm just gonna
do this to make my nose a pair of this
one ah
obviously we're gonna have to calm it
down because that's a bit romantic if
you ask me okay so I just put a little
bit of the banana powder down the center
of my nose now I'm just going in with a
bit of foundation powder to kind of
soften it looking a bit crazy I'm not
used to like anything on my nerves I
feel like it looks weird
uh I don't know I feel like if you've
never seen me before it would be like
fine but cuz I know what my nose looks
like it looks really weird that it's you
know cuz usually it's like kind of
spread out now it's time to highlight
I'm so excited for this this one is the
Ofra highlight in a shade up blissful
I'm just gonna take a little tiny pencil
brush I'm gonna pop this on my nose
a little bit down the middle let's make
the cheekbones pop so I'm just gonna go
in with my a23 brush by Anastacio this
is the best brush for highlight and then
we are gonna just go in this is honestly
like the Oprah highlighters are the best
highlights I've ever tried it's because
they look wet like they don't look
overly powdery and they're so intense
like you don't need any fix+
on your brush at all oh sorry satisfying
oh I've got pimples under that one so it
really like makes them stand out I'm
also gonna put this above my eyebrows to
make them look like they are even higher
and asar on my chin Oh hopes oily
send help run the chin don't do that
then I'm taking a a little brush and I'm
gonna put that highlight on my you know
corners this one's a blending brush so
it's really gonna diffuse the product
nicely it is a Sigma e25 and it looks so
much bigger with the highlight on it
alright so now it's time for the
lipstick so I'm just gonna go in with
like a nude so we can really overdo it
so I'm gonna take the Joey long-lasting
cream lip liner these are the best lip
liners ever this one is in the shade
Sienna this is like the perfect nude by
the way
oh this is like one of my favorite
all-time favorite liquid lipsticks
everybody only thing I don't like about
it is that when it kind of like wears
off you can see that line really
distinctively sorry if you can't reapply
all the time then definitely not use
this but this is the Jeffrey style
liquid lipstick in the shade it is the
most perfect nude shade honestly it's
like that perfect in-between nudey pink
so I'm just gonna put this all over my
lips and I'm leaving the outer edges
dock so it creates the illusion of your
lips look at about at least 20 mils in
there likely what's going on the last
step is to go in with the dry cosmetics
lay all day at setting spray OH
so I'm gonna spritz this all over my
face and then I'm going to fix my hair
and oh that's oh I can look cute for you
guys oh oh my gosh I have the best idea
I'm gonna go in with my bronzer and I'm
gonna contour my boobs even though
obviously don't need any contouring but
I'm just gonna see if it works as
everyone doesn't it away oh this is
actually working
I do the color burns while I'm at it
okay alright I'm also gonna take my
highlight and put that on my color burns
and my shoulders let's see how this goes
Wow
thank you well that's so intense oh holy

alright guys so here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it I feel like it really
has created an illusion of like plastic
surgery because seriously like the chief
Ryan looks so defined the eyes are kind
of pulled out this way their lips are
freaking huge right now and I feel like
there's just so much juice in there
apples of my cheeks oh I love it so much
so I'm still like getting used to these
brown hair it's such a big change but
