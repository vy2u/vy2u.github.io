my channel
oh my jaw is cracked oh so in today's
video I'm doing aq a I have it on one of
these in a very long time so I asked you
guys to ask me questions on Instagram
and holy shit did you guys ask me
questions there is a thousand comments
into our let's say thank you first
question is if you could travel anywhere
in the world with two people who would
it be and why
to be honest I only ever like hanging
out with one person at a time
I don't know why but it's like I have to
put all my attention on one person if I
hang out with two people it's like I
just don't know and then one person gets
left out it's quite developed oh yeah
that's how it was in school anyway so
I'm just you bit of a fear that yeah I
would probably go read Chloe Jonathan my
mom the only time I really like hanging
out with more than true people is like
when it's with my family because my
family and I get along so well where
would I go I figure anywhere there is
literally so many places are in trouble
I want to go to America I want to go to
Greece I want to go everywhere so I
literally am going to book a flight um
in the next few weeks to somewhere that
I really want to go because I love
traveling and nothing's going to stop me
except I'm gonna have to pre-record a
lot oh my god someone said what are your
what is your advice on nipple piercings
what are your views I think Kendall
Jenner has a nipple piercing and it
looks really good I would never be able
to get something through my nipple that
would be honestly like the most painful
thing ever even like bumping my nipple
or lack anything it's just so painful
and it's just like the worst feeling so
totally don't have any bad opinions on
nipple piercings obviously they covered
most the time anyway so
no one's going to see them except your
boy or girl next question is how do you
deal with fake friends I don't really
know how to answer this because I don't
have fake friends because if a friend is
being fake to me then they're not my
friend anymore if you feel like a friend
isn't being genuine then I guess just
talk about it with them and maybe come
to an understanding or fuck them off
because you don't need fake shit in your
life who is your favorite beauty and
nogi related youtuber I would have to
say my favorite non beauty related
youtuber would have to be Tana Moser
she's American so she says Tana mojo so
I don't know if I'm saying it right um
but yeah she has the best videos she's
so real and she doesn't put on that like
innocent act when she's making youtube
videos which is really refreshing
because a lot of people do do that
so she has lots of story time videos and
just like funny shit and I just they're
on stalker video I really love that um
and then Shane Dawson here I'm sure you
guys watch him like in everyone watches
him but he has really funny men yours
and then my favorite beauty related
youtuber would have to be like desi
tokens crispy um Jaclyn hill Danielle
meant to do Shannon Harris gen-xer sorry
no one knows who I'm talking about when
I say a last name um like a lot I don't
have a specific one because I more enjoy
watching that didn't it make sense am i
speaking English I enjoy watching no
Beauty related videos more that's
probably why my eyeshadow in a winged
eyeliner is still shit to this day what
is the most embarrassing thing that has
happened to you in front of your
boyfriend
mmm a lot I didn't find for the painful
lack a month and I fight a lot so a
month of seeing each other I still
wasn't fighting I was getting cramps I
literally would hold my poops in when I
slept over his house it was just like
not a good time and then I was like fuck
it
and I fought it and he's just like pip
so that was fun and then when I finally
farted the first time a lot of fighting
talk anyways when I found you farted for
the first time I literally wanted to cry
like he was so embarrassing you know
when you get like really embarrassed
that you just start laughing I was like
oh fuck my life bhaiya those
so embarrassing but a girl's gonna do
what a girl's I'm gonna do what do you
look for in a friend I honestly am sort
of picky when it comes to friends or I
want my friends to be very honest I
never want them to lie to me they lie to
me I don't know you just people that
aren't like judgey I fucking hate bitchy
girls so much I could never be friends
with bitchy girls and a lot of girls are
beachy so maybe that's why I have three
friends I don't know um I just like when
people love themselves and you can just
muck around have a good time
next question is what was your
experience like losing it you're kidding
well excuse me that's very personal I
lost my virginity about three years ago
I was like a week off being sixteen only
like kill me so little I know I'm I
don't regret it though I was doing this
guy for two years and I've served that
relationship we both lost our journey um
I remember thinking like this is kind of
weird like who invented sex like could
you imagine the first person ever having
sex just being like oh let's do this I
don't know I just think it's really
random but I guess it was kind of scary
and different and I turned out today
what was your dream Rob Bravo what was
your dream job growing up I always
wanted to be a model ever since I was a
little teeny little girl I remember like
doing photo shoots and stuff when I was
old enough so probably like 14 and 15 or
something 16 and I just didn't like it I
felt like the photographer was judging
me I felt like I need to be skinnier I
think the modeling industry is very very
harsh and it's just not something that
I'm built for I just don't think my ego
is like strong enough like yes I'm I'm
very confident but it doesn't take me
that long to be a little bit like
insecure if someone just like flicks me
down this I don't know it's hard to
explain I would have to say like I am
interested in modeling still but nothing
that's like judge me I don't really know
I love your take modeling because that
super chilled and laid
and everyone's like young and like you
just have fun doing shoots like that the
next question is how did you and John
decide you wanted to be official this is
actually so amazing but this is how it
happened
sorry guys I'm was laying in bed and I
was laying in bed next to him and I was
just like I just literally just thought
igniting my hand and he's like what and
I was like I don't know what planet I
was on then and literally like
immediately he knew what I was thinking
and then what kind of just like and they
popped the question I was like yeah it's
a miracle yeah that's just so random I
don't even know what I was thinking yes
uh-huh
didn't even ask the question I was
already saying yes next question is do
you think the court everything happens
for a reason is true and a hundred
percent yes I love that quote I believe
in that quote um like for example when
the break-in happened I was like I
wasn't happy about it but it was the
perfect little push to move into
Brisbane and I've always wanted to move
into Brisbane and Jonathan works here
and it's just like was so much easier
and like I just feel like something like
that had to happen for us to actually
come here I've wanted to be here the
longest time but yeah everything
definitely happens for a reason
and I also believe in some weird things
like you can't walk onto the poles that
are like this don't walk over there
you'll have bad luck I will even weird
things like that so anyway there we have
my Q&amp;amp;A I hope you guys liked it please
give this video a big thumbs up because
it helps me out a lot
and I will see you in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
