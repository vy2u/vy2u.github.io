channel so in today's video we're doing
a festival drugstore makeup look so
let's go ahead and jump straight into it
I'm just going to start out with the
idea lat brow pomade that this stuff is
so good I pretty much just draw a line
above my eyebrow make a little bit of an
arch because they naturally have really
straight brows then I draw a line
underneath my eyebrow and then really
lightly fill it in and I also like to
extend my brow a little bit because it
is quite short so I'm going to conceal
underneath my brows to make them nice be
serious my air refresh not just went off
mid voice over you jokin anyways I'm
going to take my Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm just going to carve
out my brows make them nice and sharp
now taking the balm that meat matte nude
eyeshadow palette I'm just picking up a
white and I'm just going to set that
concealer down on my eyelid just so it's
not tacky and all the eyeshadows can
blend out perfectly on top so now I'm
going to take this Milani eyeshadow
palette which is surprisingly really
good I mean not surprisingly I just
haven't used Milani before so I wasn't
expecting it to be that amazing because
it is pretty like cheap so I'm just
going to take the orange shade and blend
this in my crease you guys know I love
the warm shade in the transition so I'm
just going to buff it in everywhere and
then make it a little darker with a
smaller brush directly in the crease and
then going back in with the balm palette
I'm going to pick up this chocolate
brown shade and this is going on the
outer corner and also a little bit in
the crease just to darken it up a little
bit the bomb eye shadows are honestly so
good and pigmented so now let's go ahead
and make a cut crease I'm going to take
that Maybelline fit me concealer again
and I'm just taking a shader brush and
how can i concealer on and doing a half
cut crease this gets so easy after a
while I used to be so bad at it but now
it's really easy so I just took some
glitter glue and now I'm packing on some
iridescent little sparkles these were
like $3 that's so cheap I'll leave all
the names to everything down below if
you guys are interested but now let's
move on to the face so I'm taking this
nyx primer this stuff smooths the pores
or well I love it so much
oh then to the foundation I'm taking the
L'Oreal infallible and matte foundation
I feel like I've only used it like once
plus I bought it when I was back in LA
and I just completely forgot about it
because they literally have a million
foundations but I just thought it'd be a
good idea to try some new products out
and I actually love the way this
foundation looked it definitely was mad
but it wasn't like trying on the face at
all it was really full-coverage I love
it so now let's go back to the
maybelline fitme concealer I'm just
going to use this to highlight under my
eyes and also to cancel out the
discoloration so of course I'm just
going to blend that out with my board of
blenders I said this in every video but
seriously if you guys don't have a
buildable number go get yourself one
please got that good now I'm going to
take my Rimmel match perfection loose
setting powder and I'm just taking it on
an eyeshadow brush and setting
underneath my eyes I didn't want to bake
today because I do it in literally every
single video so here we go changing it
up good job Johnny hey now I'm going to
take this Maybelline powder and I'm
going to set the rest of my face I
really like this one it is absolute any
so going back to that orange shade I'm
going to take this from my outer corner
to an aqua on my lower lash line I'm
going to miss you sorry I'm really hyper
right now I can't even get get a
sentence out without having some sort of
slang on the end my bat so I'm going to
go back in with that chocolate shade and
put this on my lower lash line but I'm
just going to focus it on the outer
corner and keep that area nice and smoky
so now I'm just going to take this
essence mascara out this stuff is so
good for a drugstore mascara it really
gets in there makes all of the lashes
super black next I'm going to take a
white eyeliner and line my waterline so
the eyes are really pop because they
have small little eyes
okay so now let's move onto the lashes
I'm taking these ones from idelle these
elected double layered ones I'm so sorry
I didn't have the packaging but hunters
use them more than once I'm so sorry
just going to pop these on and Caban I
look 20 times better okay now let's move
on to contouring and everything I'm
going to take this NYX palette and I'm
going to pick up the banana shade and
just highlight under my eyes a little
bit and clean that area up and I'm also
going to take a little eye shadow brush
and kind of like clean up the sides of
the eye shadow line because it was a
little bit messy and I don't deal with
messy earth touch pinky okay so now for
the contouring shade I'm just going to
got the warmest color in that palette
and I love the way that this looked I
don't really like contouring with
hormones anymore warm turns the new
thing for me it works really well so now
for the bronzer I'm going to take this
Milani baked bronzer this oh this is my
favorite the runs are from the drugstore
it is so beautiful shimmery it glowy so
people can't even I'm going to bronze my
cheekbones and also my forehead and your
line because I'm ready for that bronze
look as you can tell so going back in
with that banana shade I'm going to
clean up under my bronzer just so it is
nice and sharp and pretty much light
under there you know what I mean yeah
now for blush I'm taking this one from
covergirl this is one of my favorite
blushes of all times it's like a really
nice universal shade so it's going to go
with every look and it also has little
shimmers in it as well so if you like a
really high load face this is going to
be perfect for you oh my gosh
okay now taking this that BH Cosmetics
Kylie Bible palette I'm okay I'm getting
emails now how broke I'm just going to
pick up a highlight shade and go in this
was the first time using it and I was so
incredibly impressed
it is so pigmented and beautiful so
while I'm at it I'm just going to
highlight my inner corners on line on
hands drugstore for the wind today hunts
because this one is one of my favorite
lip liners of all times it's by essence
it is so affordable so I'm just going to
go ahead and line my lips make them look
really juicy and then we're going to go
in with the lipstick which is also from
essence this is the first time using
this one and I was all alone out of the
actual park like are you serious this is
so cheap and so good the color is Incred
and then i'm going to take this BH
Cosmetics lipstick you guys know I can't
do a makeup look with that the ombre I'm
so sorry this one is so good so I'm just
going to pack this right in the middle
and then we can move on through the
glitter the photo part so I'm just
taking some glue under my eyes and then
I'm just going to pack it on with my
finger really lightly so I'm going to
take it in a triangle motion under my
eyes and then I'm going to bring it up
onto my cheekbones because everyone just
does like the triangle under the eye so
I'm like bitch I'm going to change it up
start a new trend
I'm sure someone else's
ready let's be real but I think I looked
so pretty I'm sorry for the bad language
I mean sometimes I just can't help it
you know what I mean I love you guys so
much don't forget to give this video a
big thumbs up and I will see you in my
next video
