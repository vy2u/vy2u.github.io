god okay I'd say chicken
hello my chickens welcome to my channel
so in today's video I'm doing a festival
makeup look because I'm going to
splendor literally tomorrow I'm so
excited but I literally have no idea
what makeup I'm doing so I just thought
we should just dance together and I'll
just play around with some makeup and
see what I can come up with so I really
hope you guys enjoy this video and let's
go ahead and jump right in let's go
ahead and start with the eyebrows so
obviously this oh my god this festival
goes from like the morning to elect
midnight so this makeup needs to stay on
so I'm going to use the Curtis
collection by Victoria brow pomade in
the shade at chestnut
the reason I'm using a pomade is because
these ones don't budge at all if these
are powder and I actually wipe my brow
like it's gone okay so this one looks
neat to start well I'm going to use this
little angled brush right here to apply
and start by brushing my eyebrows
upwards so we can put a notch in these
slabs so I say that in every video but
you guys know that's just what I was
with okay and ha I'm literally so
excited for Linda I haven't been to a
festival in the longest time and I just
think the vibe that festivals are so
much fun like everyone can just stand
and be carefree not worried about anyone
looking at you dancing like an idiot
because everyone's an idiot like that's
not a problem at all on how the brows
are really thick right now but I'm going
to carve them out with my top shaped
Cape in the shade light medium depth
grams going to put a little bit on the
back of my hand
I literally have to scrub my whole
channel tonight and it's kind of fresh
but I really need like an extra fresh
one for slender or that's a problem what
Connor actually it can be thick so just
is like one dose and generator not a
person okay I'm so annoying okay let's
do this this is literally the best brush
to carve the brows out with it's the
morphe m43 too
those candles give me frickin nightmares
every time it's not something weird I'm
like I'm gorgeous my back on fire I hate
her so much
I just prime my eyelids that they've
caused those veins at worst a page so
let's move on to the eyeshadow I'm going
to go in with my makeup geek eyeshadow
palette this into collaboration with the
many anyway this has some amazing colors
in it soft soft let's use the one I'm
going to start with this shade right
here as my transition color I didn't
want to like I don't want to like play
around with you I don't want a plane
ride with new like products just because
like for a festival look you want to use
your best stuff to know it's going to
last all there you want to make sure
like the quality is amazing and I know
the quality of makeup geek eyeshadows
are so good so let's go in with that
color that is in the shade frappe it's
going right in my crease to add some
definition I'm going to blow it out all
the way out here I'll swap on my face
this brush is the Mac to to Floyd
sorry good I'm just so over these like
some fluff pieces of hair like what are
you doing
please stay down the next color that I'm
going in with is this one right here
that one's in the shade Mars oh god it's
a beautiful leg um cranberry shade
that's the word I was looking for see ya
and then the brush that I'm using is
these Zoe's r22 7 love this line of the
crease was helps this industry are I'm
going to bring this one all the way to
the inner corner but I'm going to keep
it up noticing hi because I do want to
do a cut crease so I have to bring this
up high so the cut crease can come high
up as well we still a discolor to pick
on through oh that's so beautiful
next up it is time to cut the crease so
I'm going to do a half cut crease with a
bit of concealer and a flat shader brush
so let's go in and do this next I'm just
going in with my 3d Beauty palette and
I'm going to set that down with dislike
a light color here I'll just set that
concealer down so it's not Grayson on me
it looks a bit cool kiz' moment don't
worry it will look better in a second
lovely the next product I'm taking is
the Too Faced shadow insurance glitter
glue and this is going all over the area
that I put the cut crease so I'm just
going to put the feet on the back of my
hand
what's gone this one is really good so I
need a flat shader brush and the product
that I'm putting over the top is the in
glide to our keep an eye shadow in a one
two three it is sort of pretty I'm try
not to look up I want a muscle fast off
I'm just going to this on all my god
that's amazing just beware there's going
to be a bit of fallout so you do the
eyes for sure I'm just going to go back
in with this crease color and Pat over
to these two so we can have a nice blend
going on just put a flat shader brush I
think I'm going to clean this up just
because when I put concealer over it's
just going to bruise anyway so just give
my makeup remover wipes yes now let's
move on to the primer I'm governing the
lesson and going in with my Rimmel I'm
just so excited Rimmel lasting finish
primer this is a skin perfecting primer
and it helps your makeup last up to
eight hours which is exactly what we
need because I asked sorry else I'm
gonna resent since I saw a freaking long
this one feels really moisturizing on
the face as well which is amazing
I love having a really juicy face you
know I'm just going to blend this all
over my face now it's time for the
foundation I'm going in with you Natasha
Danone our foundation full coverage
brute complex it's amazing this one's in
the shade at fifty a medium this is a
dark one I do have a light one but you
know that I like to go really tan so I'm
going to do it he uses one once and I
friggin loved it so I'm really excited
see how it goes again and to apply this
I'm taking my wonderful buffer brush by
zoeva what's new nothing really oh yeah
has really nice coverage for a festival
I want to have the fullest coverage I've
ever had in my entire life
okay face so that I always go over my
lips just because the pigmentation in my
lips are kind of dark so I want to make
sure the lipstick is as true to color as
I want touch oh my god this foundation
is so beautiful really nice like full
coverage for because it looks so much on
and it just looks like a satin finish
look it's not true Matt it's not Joey at
all it just looks re healthy on the skin
and of course blending the rest into my
hairline and then to concealer of course
I'm taking my shape tape again just
because this liner has the full of
coverage and I know this is what I'm
going to be using when I go to model
Gorge giraffes are still learning this
in with my border blender bring it down
nice and fast so we can keep this
highlighted now to bake I'm going in all
this really light isn't it I love it
I'm going to use the Kat Von D
translucent powder some need to fill in
a while actually I'm a bit nervous sort
of course before you bake you want to
just pop over to concealer to make sure
there's no lines left otherwise you're
going to take on the lines and I'm just
saying they're real bloody dead stuff
okay so now it's time to set the face
and I love this powder with my whole
life like I'm sure you guys notice it is
a benefit hello flawless in the shade
champagne oh oh this is just sorry good
okay so plus on it that's a problem it
adds a little bit of extra coverage and
it just makes my face feel so soft sweet
and I love it I'm just going to pack
this on my face I don't want to like
slap it around cuz I don't want to move
the foundation at all okay so back to
the eyes I'm going to go in with Mars
once again this color is my life right
now I'm really going to smoke this out
of my lower lash line just make it cool
when you clean this with a blending
brush and for the mascara I'm taking the
tight tightest mascara this one has a
really good one that really gets into
every single lash so I'm just going to
coat my top and bottom lashes I'm going
to put the biggest policies on it's
going to be I'm laughing all these
lashes are so nice
okay I'm taking these ones from Lily
lashes in a style luck
because you guys are going to die look
those just quickly before I apply my
lower lash mascara and my lashes I'm
going in with some white island to
really open up my eyes so I'll be taking
the Stila Alpine I don't know this one
is sort of good at last a really long
time so I always like to warm it up in
the back of my hands first sort of a
bubble I always pick myself on a ball
okay so I'm going to go in with a lot of
mascara very soon I just need to wait
for the /bin Drive I think this one
isn't mink hair that's why it's um
really hard to apply but and so that's a
good thing so let's go in with the
contour I'm taking the Anasazi Beverly
Hills contour kit black to medium and
the goal then I'm picking up am I going
to be so annoying okay I'm taking this
color right here and I'm just going to
carve out onto my cheekbones makes it a
little more defined why not
that's a lot more defined that's not a
perform at all now for the bronzer I'm
taking V at bare minerals invisible glow
in the shade 10 I definitely don't want
an invisible go I want this to be really
intense this one's like super shimmery
so I just want to see how it looks I
hope you feeling we might need something
a bit darker yes we do that but that
looks really pretty and glowy
you have only something darker whatever
I'm going in with more bronzer I'm in
care just want to be BH Cosmetics satin
bronzer in the shade tropical tan it
sounds like a muslin it's like gold it's
exactly what I was looking for in
another product I couldn't find it so
whatever I'm just going to top literally
the feeling that you get when you're at
a festival is the best feeling in the
world I just feel so free and happy and
I just love that everyone else is so
happy as well like it's the best feeling
ever and then for the blush I'm going in
with this Too Faced peach blush this
one's really pretty I'm just gonna use
the same bronzer brush that I just used
