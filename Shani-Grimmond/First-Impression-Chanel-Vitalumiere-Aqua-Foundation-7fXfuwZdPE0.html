to my channel so in today's video I'm
doing a first impressions on a
foundation this is the chanel vitae
Lumia aqua foundation SPF 15 and I have
the shade 50 beige I got color matched
like two days ago with a really dark
fake tan that's why I have a fresh fake
ten on now if you're wondering why my
face is so what so I think it will match
things crossed fingers crossed so it
says that it is Chanel's most surprising
foundation a soft light texture to the
face for an amazingly even result
it gives a nice radiant glow freedom for
all women in search of a delightful
foundation that respects their skin and
reveals their natural beauty so I'm
guessing it's not a very full coverage
foundation I'm like sweating like a dog
right now this is disgusting so I'm just
going to shake the bottle up really
really well because I tried to pour it
out on my hand before and it was really
watery so I'm guessing that it separates
a bit so shreeka Fred Fred day oh and
I'm going to be trying this foundation
on for like seven or so hours so I'm
going to be coming back every few hours
to give you guys an update on how my
foundation is holding up so by the end
of the day we'll see how it looks
so I already applied my moisturizer I'm
just going with my Mac prep and prime at
skin based bys each on half of my face
just to see if it kind of makes it stay
on a little bit longer so I'll apply on
this side I don't have a mirror that
would probably help right now oh my god
that's actually sweat so first thing I
want to say is the packaging is really
nice it's just super sleek it has 30
mils in it and I think that's about all
that I have to say for this foundation
so I'm just going to put a little bit
onto the back of my hand
it smells like really strong sunscreen
maybe so I'm going to start by applying
half of it with the buffer brush from wi
just to see how it applies so I think
the colors actually really masks my fake
tan so that's always a plus
it actually looks so good
it feels super light on the skin as well
which is good they're going to play all
of the foundation with this brush
because it's actually looking really
nice and airbrushed it's covering my
pimples really well but doesn't look
cakey
at all okay good the foundation looks
 has really not I love it it's like
silk silk oh my god an obsessed with it
oh okay so this is one layer all over
the face as you can see you can still
see my breakouts a little bit it does
have like a really really nice light to
medium coverage but I'm going to going
with another pump just to see if it
covers up those problem areas so let's
see how this looks
sorry guys it was not recording but all
I did then was added my NARS radiant
creamy concealer and a shave custard
under my eyes because I feel like the
foundation is a bit dark so I just want
to brighten my face up a little bit so
I'm blending this in with my little
Beauty Blender and I have run this under
water to make sure it has absorbed the
concealer
so the concealer blended in our really
really nicely with the foundation I'm
going to go ahead and finish the rest of
my makeup and then I'll be back to tell
you my overall thoughts of the final
result so I'll be back in two seconds so
I finished the rest of my makeup now I'm
loving this lip color it's the Lime
Crime Velveteen in this shade utopia
completely completely obsessed with it
so I think the foundation overall has a
really really nice full coverage little
full coverage I could definitely build
it up and I love that about it because
it can be very lightweight or it can be
like a full-on like night out foundation
so I am very impressed with the end
result of this foundation it just looks
really beautiful and luminous and it
doesn't look for a cakey at all I'm just
super impressed so I'm going to be
coming back every few hours to give you
guys an update so hopefully it lasts
because I'm very very lucky
head-over-heels for this foundation
right now it's ridiculous oh my god BRB
hey guys so I'm back now it has been
five hours and actually haven't really
looked at my makeup properly so let's
see what it looks like okay so I have
really really bad laugh lines right here
which I get with every single foundation
so that's fine
I also have a really really oily black
t-zone especially on my nose here I
never usually get oily there so that's
really weird and I thought I needed it I
think the coverage is definitely still
there so it still has a really nice full
coverage but I would say that this
foundation will look nice for about four
or so hours and then after that it will
start looking a little bit cakey like it
has in my t-zone so I'm going to fix it
up with a little bit of powder and see
if that looks better
what see what powder what oh my god it's
so hot my face never gets oily this is
so weird so as you can see as soon as I
put the powder down the shine goes away
so let's do the other side
okay so the pad is on I feel like the
foundation literally just looks as good
as new it does look a little bit cakey
around this area but everywhere else I'm
actually really impressed with how like
well the coverage has stayed on my face
so so far I'll definitely say this is a
really good foundation but I'll be back
in like another two hours to see how is
holding up oh my god it's hot okay so I
changed my background you've only got
this wet water look at because I can't
be bothered going back over there to my
desk so final opinion on this foundation
it is absolutely beautiful 100% worth
the price I think the coverage has
lasted all day the only issue that I had
with it was the shininess that I got
after like four or so hours so if you
would be you know getting this
foundation I would recommend like having
a powder with you just to touch out
throughout the day it is honestly it's
so breathtakingly beautiful this
foundation clap-clap you should now do
the job so both sides of my face are
still on pretty evenly so the primer
didn't help at all really um yeah that's
all that I have to say amazing
foundation I probably read it like a
nine out of ten that's how good it is uh
yeah I feel like I'm too close to say
bye anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this
video and hopefully it helped you add a
little bit until next time stay gorgeous
I'm kidding that's Gigi's outro until
next time have a nice day no love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
