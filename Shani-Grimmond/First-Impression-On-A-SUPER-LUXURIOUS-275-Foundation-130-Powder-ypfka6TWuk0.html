channel so in today's video I'm doing a
first impression and review on the lip
Prairie skin caviar foundation and
concealer this was two hundred and
seventy five dollars I picked it up from
David Jones yesterday that's how much it
is in Australia anyway I'm pretty sure
it'd be a little bit cheaper in America
like two hundred dollars but three
hundred and seventy five dollars I've
never come across a foundation that
expensive so I thought why not try it
out and see if it's actually worth that
much money I mean how could a foundation
be worth how much money like to be
honest and I'm also going to be using
the Lipari electrons loosen powder this
one was one hundred and thirty dollars
this one's called the cellulite
treatment loose powder and I have a
shade translucent one because I wanna do
some baking under there so I just grab
my laptop and did a little bit of
research on this foundation to see what
exactly it is supposed to do for your
skin so before we get into it I am in
the shade and the beige hopefully it's
aren't shown for me oh my god I was
stressful but on the website it says
everything you need full flawless skin
in one bottle one part luxury foundation
one part professional level concealer so
the concealers on the top you just lift
the lid up like so I really don't like
how the concealer doesn't look much
lighter than the foundation I like I
really highlighted under eye but what
can you do the foundation has SPF 15 in
it it is a luxurious cream that gives a
naturally flawless complexion and keeps
the skin hydrated with a Joey finish so
I'm hoping that it is kind of full
coverage at least medium coverage it's
as natural influence I mean who would
pay like that much morning for like a
natural foundation they thinking various
formulas support affirming with
legendary caviar extracts you guys know
caviar is fish eggs I'm guessing that's
why this brand is so expensive it has a
lot of like weird in it my first
impression with the packaging I think it
is a really luxurious a great quality I
mean it should be right it's like 200
sony vaio hands okay so I'm just going
to unscrew the lid and it has a little
spatula which I love and one side I'm
gonna use a Beauty Blender the other
side I'm going to use a kabuki brush
just to see how it will work on my skin
but
I do think a Beautyblender would be
better because it kind of does look like
a not a runny consistency because
obviously it's not dripping off the
spatula but I just feel like a big
lender would work better so I've really
moisturize my face now I'm just going to
put this on my skin oh my god that color
match is incredible for my fake tan I
just applied a really light layer of
fake time yesterday and that's great
that's really lucky because those how
many shades I mean it wasn't like so
many but I mean so many shades that
could have matched me potentially but I
didn't see any really dark shades or
like a really light shades which is a
disappointment but maybe they do have
them available just not install anymore
okay so I've just put a few little dots
on my face I'm just going to blend it in
with my Beauty Blender this is so far oh
my gosh
I don't really know what to expect it
smells really nice but it definitely has
a fragrance and that just blended out so
well Wow
I feel a little bit uncomfortable
putting caviar on my face though like I
know it doesn't give me a good feeling
so my first impression with the first
layer I would have to say it feels
really nice in my skin I can't feel it
at all the coverage I would say is kind
of like a medium like a light medium
covered right now but I am going to
build it up you can definitely see like
freckles through that still but the
formula was incredible it just blends on
so beautifully I love this color it's a
perfect neutral color well how does a
lot oh wow so I give those expensive
actually I'm just going to blend this
all in with a Beauty Blender because
it's like very thin you blend it out so
it just works perfectly just rubbing
this everywhere well the smell is very
strong I don't really like when
foundations have SPF in it just because
I don't want to flash back when taking
photos like if I write at nighttime
I don't need sunscreen in my foundation
at nighttime and that's when I wear my
makeup a lot of the time so if I do want
sunscreen I just put on myself but I
guess some people like it or how can you
do to Michael head I feel like it's just
working like any normal like high-end
foundation
I mean obviously what else is it going
to do make my skin look completely
change until like nikkietutorials skin
probably not wear the looks of my skin
right now it looks like I'm just wearing
any normal foundation so I'm hoping
there is something that like really
stands out about this foundation but so
far it does look beautiful on the skin
I'm just like questioning like is it
worth that much money so I'm going to
put another layer on and see if it
builds up through a full coverage right
now I would probably just keep the
coverage at this because I like how it
looks nice and natural and healthy like
just in case you know we went to a
clubbing or something we got to see if
it's going to work so put some more on
my face and see if it like is that's Rin
alright well it's definitely building up
nicely just added a little bit of extra
coverage also you can see my arm feels
like a little girls now it's time to see
if the concealer is any good I'm really
excited this one so as you can see you
just pop this lid open and the concealer
is down here so this kind of looks like
a color correcting concealer it's not
going to brighten under there I don't
think I would say maybe it is the show
later I'm not sure I'm her Peters but um
hopefully it's just going to cover like
all the darkness like dark purple in
here I don't really have that much but
we'll see oh it is a very pigmented I
literally just put my brush in there
once and it is it's thick definitely
fixed so I'm just going to paint this on
my face yes it is later
alright let's stick this oh wow that did
blend out really quickly and nicely as
you can see it so I covered my bags
completely look how different that looks
mmm because the concealer is pretty sick
I mean I have to go in and set it really
quickly before it creases
let's crease the tiny bit that's right
anyway start I'm just going to use the
translucent powder so this one does come
with the travel size which i think is
pretty cool so you're getting three for
the price of one
I guess I'm just going to pour this
powder into the lid when I got it on the
waist any is what we have so far I've
just put some on the back of my Beauty
Blender now I'm just going to dab this
under my eyes to fake a little bit
oh it feels very stiff you literally
just like a melted into the skin like
could you see at the start I look like
this and then like five seconds later I
just like completely dissolved into the
skin that is so cool I like weird I'm
going to use whatever is left in here to
take the rest of my face because that's
what it's actually for I don't think
it's designed to bake at all but what
powder is designed to bake usually it's
going to set the face okay so my first
impression with this powder it is
grabing collect the wet parts of my
foundation and making it look a little
blotchy what look see if it goes away
when I blend it in well that was a lot
of pollution I've done it my face isn't
really are she from this color
definitely very very matte it is set my
face really well now that my face is
overly matte and overly ashy from this
powder I'm going to go do the rest of my
makeup to see how it goes on top but I
would have to say my first impression
with this is I love how it made it under
my eyes look like it is an incredible
job at baking under there it is look so
soft the rest of the face does looks
very airbrushed as well from the
foundation and the powder I really do
like the foundation so far I would just
have to say I'd only use it for baking
instead of setting the whole face or
maybe I just use too much of the powder
and I went a she but I definitely do
think this kind of like makes it look a
tiny bit ashy my fault I put too much on
but yeah I'm not going to do this for
the face again so I just finished my
makeup and everything that blended on
perfectly on top of the foundation and
powder I'm really happy with how it
looks I honestly think it looks so soft
and airbrushed and just so beautiful but
the thing is right you can get a
foundation that's like $12 $20 and I
feel like it'll look nearly just as good
if not just as Brutus's so I guess we'll
just see how well this foundation holds
up to see if it actually is less it but
anyways I will see you guys in a few
hours right now it is nine o'clock in
the morning so I'm going to get my hair
done and then separately take five hours
and I'm going to come back and we'll see
how it looks okay so I'm back now it has
been six hours exactly so it is three
o'clock I really looked at my face yeah
I just want you guys to see my first
reaction to like for my foundation looks
like up close but
I did go to the hairdresser's and around
here obviously came off that's normal
and I did get a little bit of
conditioner on my cheek so that's like
the only thing that I've done so the
first thing that I have to say is the
mascara is transferring all under my eye
obviously it's something to do with the
concealer foundation or powder that I'm
using and it's just clinging to under my
eyes as black all under there it never
usually happens with products that I use
at a cheaper so that's a bit
disappointing because I noticed all day
just kept happening and happening I'm
like oh my god this is so freaking
frustrating but anyways let's see what
the foundation looks like you guys have
to see bindi shoes for the haircut hi do
you want to hang no to every what she
looks like sure you're right this is
what he thought the first thing that I
can really tell is under my chin right
here it's separated completely and it
looks really cakey right here that
usually doesn't happen to me so that's a
really weird my laugh lines are showing
really bad but happens with every single
foundation so I was expecting that to
happen usually I just take a brush and
blend over it and it kind of just like
fades away but on the rest of my face
the foundation is holding up really well
I don't know what's happening under my
eyes is like the concealer looks really
like gross maybe it's because all that
mascara has smudged under there but I
don't know I just feel like it looks a
little bit like dirty the foundation has
come off my nose as well so I guess that
I really need to leave it on for any
longer because it's already done what I
thought it might be like separating all
of that so I guess right now I can say
that I definitely don't think that this
foundation or this powder is worth the
money I definitely am going to keep
using it and I do like the foundation I
do like the powder as well for the eyes
but for the price I definitely don't
think it's worth it but anyways don't
forget to give this video a big thumbs
up because it honestly helped me out so
much let's try and get this video to
20,000 it likes that would be amazing
I love you guys so much and I'll see you
in my next video hmmm
