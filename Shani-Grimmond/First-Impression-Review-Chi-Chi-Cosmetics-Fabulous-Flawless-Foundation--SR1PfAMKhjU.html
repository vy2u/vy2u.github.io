I'm doing a first impressions on the
tutu fabulous and flawless foundation
this is going to be my first first
impressions video I just thought it
would be fun to try something a little
different and I want to try this
foundation for quite a while now so I
thought this would be the perfect time I
hope you guys enjoy this video and let's
jump into it so first of all the
packaging is amazing I really like it
because it's just sleek and simple and
it has a pump so you can never go wrong
with a pump I love them I just want to
read a few things that are on the back
of the box again super cute box it says
oil-free ultra lightweight formula
medium to buildable coverage it's long
wearing smudge proof easy glide on
application makes your skin look fresh
soft natural and fresh I think I said
that it says it's moisturizing and
hydrating and it has all these vitamins
in it so that's always fabulous I have a
shade at 9 golden and 7 medium natural
and the cool thing about it is when you
go into the shops it has a little
description of the color tones on the
box this one for golden is for medium to
tan skin with golden olive undertones
and the 7 medium natural one says for
medium skin tones with neutral
undertones and I did see one that has
pink undertones and there was others
that have yellow undertones I think the
color range is pretty good for me but
for everyone else I'm not quite sure
because it doesn't go that light and it
doesn't go that dark so hmm so I will be
coming back and telling you guys what I
think of the foundation every few hours
so I'll leave it on to the end of the
day to give you guys a full review on it
so I'm going to be applying it with the
Beauty Blender and the Sigma flat top
kabuki brush half and half just to see
what applies better so I'm just going to
mix the two colors together and see how
I go with this to match to my neck I'm
just going to put a little bit on the
box just so I can work off that I mean
the consistency looks really nice it's
not too runny it's not too thick it's
just like in-between I put about two
pumps of each to get that much there so
yeah I've really applied my moisturizer
and everything that I usually do okay so
let's jump into this I'm excited so
obviously I'm trying to match it to my
neck just so the colors are hopefully
the same
I haven't found a foundation that
actually matches my tan really nicely so
this is going to be a mission and a half
I think it blends really easily so I
like that as you can see my 10 is more
unlike the greeny brown side so I don't
think I'm like ever going to find a
foundation that will actually match up
to that like exactly it's giving me a
really nice coverage as well so that's
nice I'm just going to swap over to my
beauty blender to blend it out even more
see how this goes
I seriously swear that these Beauty
blenders make every single foundation
look amazing so far I'm actually
absolutely loving this foundation it's
better than any foundation that I've
ever used so let's hope that it lives up
to its expectations and actually stays
on for a long time one thing that I
don't know if you guys will like and
that's the fact that you have to use
about eight pumps to get like a really
full coverage I don't mind using that
many pumps only because $20 is pretty
cheap for a foundation so I can always
just get more I'm just going to put a
bit more over these pimples to see if it
covers it is definitely doing the job so
now I'm just popping a little bit of
concealer under my eyes just to see how
it works with the foundation I'm using
the maybelline instant age rewind in the
shade light pale so I'm just going to
dab that on let's see how it goes okay
so all done with the concealer now I'm
going to go ahead and finish the rest of
my makeup and I'll be right back tada so
I finished my makeup I'm actually so so
impressed with this foundation I
definitely think that I'm going to be
using this a lot more this is probably
the best foundation that I've ever used
especially for a drugstore foundation
it's done a really really good job so
I'm going on a cruise tomorrow to
vanuatu and by the time you guys are
watching this I'll be on my cruise right
now and I am going to be using this
foundation all week and then I'll give
you a little update in the description
box when I get back so I'll see you guys
in about three hours it is now 1:30 and
yeah I'll see you soon
so I am back it is now 5:30 and it is
dark outside so it's been on for about
five hours I'm actually
really impressed with how well it stayed
on it has faded a little bit on my nose
but every foundation that I use does
that I do have a few creases in my laugh
lines again I get that with every single
foundation that I use so I am quite
impressed I'm probably going to be
living on for another like two hours and
they'll give you guys another update and
I am back again it is now 7:30 I'm in my
pajamas because I was just so
uncomfortable wearing normal clothes I
haven't really had a very active day
I've been really busy like editing and
packing my bag for Vanuatu so I haven't
been like running or anything so that's
really why the foundation is still like
perfectly put to my face but overall
this foundation is absolutely amazing it
has lasted all day the coverage is still
there and it's easy to apply and it
hasn't gotten oily it might look a
little bit shiny because of the lights
shining on my face now I literally
cannot find anything wrong with this
foundation at all I will be using this
foundation for the next week straight
and I'll keep you guys updated on what I
think of it so yeah I'll see very soon
bye
