my channel I am so excited for today's
video because I'm doing a first
impression swatches and eating tests on
the Kylie Jenner lip kits so I have the
liquid lipstick in the shade
oh so excited for this one and then I
have all the metal liquid lipsticks and
I also have all of the glosses as well
so let's jump straight into this because
these have been sitting here for at
least two weeks and I'm dying to try
them out huh let's go let's go let's
start with a shade exposed I'm hoping
that this one it's just going to be like
an everyday nice nude wearable color all
the other shades in her lip kit I feel
aren't like an everyday shade I don't
like wearing Pink's I don't like wearing
dark nudes I like just like a basic
light nude so much this is what it looks
like here it definitely looks a lot more
peach in this packaging and this one
here hmm can I just say the packaging
for these products are absolutely
amazing and they did come in two weeks
which i think is pretty good coming from
overseas so I'm just gonna wipe my lip
gloss off my lips right now so we can
get this watch can't wait so I'm just
going to start lining my lips
it literally feels like I'm just rubbing
butter on my lips it's so nice and it
feels really moisturizing as well so now
let's go in with the actual liquid
lipstick sounds exactly like the other
ones very like candy cupcake smelling
it's really strong ooh
this definitely is a lot darker than I
had hoped as you can see on the box as
well my lips look a lot more peachy then
on here on here definitely looks more
nudie Brown so this is what exposed
looks like I think it's really pretty I
think it's perfect for like an everyday
where it's super easy to pull off I put
it on about 20 seconds ago and it's
already dry it feels super moisturizing
and I would have to say this would be
one of my favorite shades in the whole
range gorgeous I feel like I'm going to
be doing a lot of eating in this video
I'm going to grab something to eat and
see how well this lasts on my lips
usually when I wear lipstick and liquid
lipstick and stuff it does come off a
little bit just because obviously when
you're eating you're eating the liquid
lipstick at the same time so I'm gonna
grab some food and did you know that a
woman eats at least one lipstick in
their lifetime I heard that on BuzzFeed
and I think it's true I had a lot of
lipstick she is just some water I'm just
gonna drink normally like how it always
do lick my lips a little bit see how it
goes this is the best video I've ever
had to film I don't eat at the same time
so as you can see right here it has
faded off a little bit where I've been
like drinking and eating and stuff so
obviously if you were to get this and
use it you'd have to take it with you
throughout the day to reapply with us
same with every liquid lipstick overall
though I do think it has a nice lasting
power when you're eating and drinking it
only faded very very small amount so
let's move on to the next shade oh my
goodness these are so hard to get off
that's how you know they're going to
last a pretty long time on your lips got
to put some foundation over my lips
because it looked like I had a serious
pash rash from rubbing that off so hard
now let's move on to the metals I'm
super excited about these because
obviously it's not something that you
would usually have in your collection
something that's really shimmery so I
have all three shades we have rain king
kay and here here air it's called air I
remember people correcting me last time
okay so let's start with hair
it is just a really nice bronzy gold
shade by the looks of the packaging this
is the oh the lighter shade this is very
mu C mm-hmm god I actually love this
color so much and you definitely can't
really see the shimmers throughout it
it's very very subtle it's still
something different I wouldn't say that
this one is as pigmented as the matte
liquid lipsticks it's more of like a
shoe consistency so I am building it up
a little bit so this is what hair looks
like that's how you even see it I think
it's absolutely gorgeous it's so
incredibly wearable I actually didn't
think any of the metallics would be
wearable at all because they do have
like little shimmers in it so basically
what this is is like a light pinky nude
with gold like light gold reflex in it
and it is stunning
alright girlfriend it's time to do some
eating and drinking so I don't think
that some will last as well as the
mattes obviously because I don't think
it is a matte it does feel a little bit
wet still and when you touch it it does
come off a tiny tiny bit on your fingers
so let's see how well this lasts
I'm actually test with this ahh yeah I'm
so happy yeah it is coming off on the
cap up here so I couldn't imagine it
lasting as long who also agree to the
new shape don't taste as good I'm sure
look down so as you can see on the lid
there let's definitely come up and
transferred all over there let's see
what it looks like
as you can see it has come off in
patches just here touch rock we're all
good to go as you can see it does look a
little tiny bit patchy when you reapply
the next metal that I have here is
called at King K so this one's more of a
bronzey shade and I do think this one
will be more like intense because it is
a bit darker so let's see what this one
looks like well this one is a lot more
opaque and then when I just tried I'm
actually really really impressed with
the formula of these products they're
very very different to the matte
formulas but they're still work really
nice and they just feel they just feel
beautiful and lips I'm so impressed so
that's what King K looks like I actually
do think it's such a beautiful shade but
I think it's more for like a special
occasion like a festival or something
because it
is really really shimmery and really
metallic I would say that how is a lot
more wearable and this one can be worn
on like a daily basis the last metal
that we have here is called a rain this
one is really really intense I don't
know how this is going to look on me but
basically like a ready maroon kind of
color copper I don't know whoa this is
really pigmented really opaque so this
is what rain looks like I have actually
obsessed with this the color it's just
so unique you can't really see too much
shimmer you can definitely see that's
metallic but it's not like over-the-top
it's not like chunky glitter Wow I just
went to my tooth it's just like a really
nice subtle glow to the lips now we have
the three glosses to try out these ones
I'm super excited about because they
look amazing on her like Instagram which
is watching them they just look super
super opaque and it looks like you don't
even need a lipstick underneath you
could just wear it on its own so let's
see if that's actually the case so I'm
going to start with so cute which is the
lightest nude color these are all nudes
which is like totally up my alley
yes mmm I love this the color payoff is
amazing it's just like super stringy
when you pull it out this color is
everything I wish I had this in and
matte liquid lipstick like this color a
Lightner hmm it's the perfect nude color
oh my god why is it taking so long to
apply I kind of wish it was like a doe
foot applicator that would be so much
easier so that's what this so cute gloss
looks like I think it's absolutely
amazing the quality oh yeah it's on
point so the color payoff is incredible
you can definitely see how it just
lightened my lips up it's super super
glossy it's not sticky and kind of
tastes a bit gross I don't like mmm I
would have to say this would be one of
my favorite shades that I've tried from
the whole Kylie cosmetic range I'm super
super happy with that one so let's have
a little drink and see okay this is like
always the ultimate test with lip
glosses I don't think I've ever had one
that actually lasts so I mean come on
it's all over the bottles and I'm
literally not even hungry doing it for
the video I'm actually pretty impressed
with how
well it stayed on while I was eating I
can see that the color has faded a
little bit it's not as like opaque but
it still is all of my lips you just have
to like rub your lips together after
you've eaten and it still has like a
nice coat it's just not as thick now
trying on the shader literally this one
is the middle gloss shade so as you can
see this is one they just trade on it is
a lot darker so let's see how this one
goes
well this is nice I would say that this
shades kind of like a your lip color but
better shade it is very similar to my
lip color with foundation I do feel like
would be a good idea to apply a lip
liner before the gloss because it is
kind of hard to make the line nice and
precise with a gloss because it is kind
of runny I'm just going to try and blend
it out with my fingers just along the
edges so that's what literally looks
like I think it's absolutely gorgeous I
still would prefer the lighter shade
more just because I like a lighter lip
but this one still is really really
really nice I feel like this would be a
lip color that would just suit any
makeup look like anything colorful eyes
neutral eyes just because it is so basic
but in a good way maybe the words
versatile the last gloss shade that we
have here is called like so this one is
the darkest nude of the lot roll that is
really dark it almost looks like a
purpley mobby kind of color instead of a
nude a little bit really does go a long
way
I only just pulled it out and it's
already done my whole bottom lip I would
have to say like is my least favorite
one I just don't think it matches my
skin tone really well but I think would
look absolutely amazing on a woman or a
man of color and then the other two that
I shared with you would be good for pale
skin to my skin tone so a quick little
overview of the products I really really
like the shade exposed I just wish it
was a tad bit lighter but I do
definitely see myself wearing it it is
super super wearable then with the
metals
I actually really like these I didn't
think I would it's funny how like I
thought these would be the products I
would like a lease but I kind of like
them emotionally so my favorite as I
said is how I'm probably like butchering
all of these names kink hmm
it's alright maybe for like a festival
or something
and then the maroon one was absolutely
stunning like I was really shocked that
I loved that one as far as the lip
glosses girl I do think you would only
need one shade that kind of suits your
skin tone because that's all that's
really necessary as I said my favorite
is so cute I freaking love it so much so
yeah I hope you guys liked this video
