so in today's video I'm doing a a very
flawless face that was very minimal
products so kind of like a no makeup
makeup look just if you want to like
leave the house but still feel very
confident with your skin we're really
going to focus on the skin today so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video so of course the first step to a
very flawless base is to make sure your
skin is hydrated and healthy and glowy
so what I like to use is the Bobbi Brown
vitamin enriched face base I've been
using this for like a year now and I
still have so much left it just makes a
little I always fuck up when I try and
say this part it wanted to make correct
skin feels so beautiful
and it just allows the makeup on top to
have a really smooth application so what
I'm going to do is just take a synthetic
brush and just pop this all over my skin
I would definitely recommend
moisturizing or like prepping your skin
even if you do have oily skin just a
great base and then for the primer I'm
going in with the Becca backlight
priming filter I love this stuff because
it adds a really nice that glow to the
skin it just makes the skin look so
healthy and radiant so let's just put
two cards on my brush and work this into
my skin the last dramatic my makeup is
the more I like to focus on the base so
like all the moisturizer and stuff
because honestly makes the biggest
difference so let's go ahead and move on
to the actual skin and color correcting
at my face to my fake tan or if you guys
have any redness or anything like that
this works wonders and then actually a
CC cream so this one is from it
cosmetics and it says your skin but
better CC cream color correcting full
coverage cream anti-aging hydrating
serum and also has SPF 50 in it which is
amazing and I have the shade medium
which is perfect for me and my fake tan
look at that optical I just love
matching the two it just makes me feel
happy I'm going to start working on this
side of my face and just take it in
circular motions the brush that I'm
using is the Real Techniques buffing
brush this one is incredible for
foundation so I'm going to try and
spread it around as much as I can so we
can use as little amount of product this
product definitely adds a bit of
coverage but it still looks
very natural on the skin because you can
see what's happening underneath it so
what I always like to do is just take my
damp Beauty Blender and Pat over the
application just to pick up any excess
product because I do want it to be
obviously Gorge and no streaks I am
going to set my skin that where I would
normally crease so it really depends on
your skin where you would need to sit
but of course we all need to do under
our eyes because that creases so easily
and I always crease in my laugh lines
right here and wherever you don't want
to go you can go ahead and set that as
well but the powder that I'm using is
the Rimmel stay matte this is the
transparent powder and it's super light
but it does like settle down that shine
a little bit so I'm just going to make
this part a little bit more matte just
sort of look oily but I still want to
rest my face book very radiant just
lightly putting it under my eyes so I
don't move any of that CC cream and also
setting my lid because that crease is
all the time on me see as you can see
right here there's still a lot of skin
up poking through you can still see a
little bit of redness and freckles on my
nose but it still did make my skin look
really beautiful and like naturally
flawless now it's time to neaten up the
brows a little bit I just want to add a
little bit of an arch because my brows
are so fucking straight out like slugs I
mean I love it but like just want a
little bit of an oxford what I'm taking
today is the benefit precise on my brow
pencil this one have a shade up it's a
shade at number three so firstly I'm
just going to take the spoolie and rush
through my brows just in case like any
foundation good in there and then I'll
just take little tiny strokes to add a
little tiny bit of color in there but
nothing too noticeable making a tiny
arch as well because like literally like
where my arch thank you as I get to the
front of my brow I'm going to be very
very light handed because I don't want
too much shade there next I'm going to
take some that clear brow gel
I love the appearance of the brows going
upwards looking very full and luscious
so this line is from Adele I just picked
this one up it is the brow sculpting gel
so of course is clear so it's going to
look super natural I'm just going to
push my brows
and I'm going to push my brows upwards
oh my God my face is edgy this is
literally the easiest way to make your
brows look 20 times fluffier I tell oh
oh wow that's a bit too much well I love
it now time for the lashes so I'm going
to go in with my eyelash color of course
we can make the appearance of bigger
lashes without any makeup so let's clamp
them a rather base I'm just going to
hold that
oh well that's too close it is fucked up
my eye I'm just going to go in with a
little bit of a scar not too much to
make it look like I actually have
mascara on but I'm taking the Tarte
TARDIS and scarrella I'm just going to
put this very lightly through my lashes
just starting from the base and flicking
it up Gorge now looks like I have flash
extensions I would love to get lash
extensions but I'm just so scared that
like it's going to pull my natural
lashes out and like I can't put false
lashes on over the top which is so I
could I do that all the time like every
weekend when I go out so like what do
you mean next I'm just going to take the
tied in a rim liner this one really
brightens up the waterline if you have
like a red order line if you're tired or
whatever is going to make your eyes look
so much more awake and it's going to
bring more attention to the eyes so I
need a mirror like what do you mean so
I'm just going to warm it up on the back
of my hand so I don't irritate my eye
and I'm going to go in in my waterline
oh my god I'm is sorry Jody oh well I'm
just going to put a tiny bit of mascara
on my lower lashes just to make them a
bit black but I'm not going to do it for
the length just because there's a little
bit of powder in there okay and then for
the lips I'm going in with this one just
from like holes it's the classic comics
and moisturizing lip balm I love this
because it makes my lips like really
tingly and I love that feeling it makes
them so glossy as well so I'm just going
to put a bit of this on and then for the
cheeks I'm just going to add a one
product on there and that is the Milani
baked blush in the shade alyssum over on
Chloe I don't want to add a bronzer
because I don't really feel like that's
a natural look but adding blush
definitely does look natural because
it's just like a natural flush of color
to the cheeks and this one's just like a
coral color it's not too pink it's not
true bronze it's like the perfect like
in-between shades so you know tap off
the excess and just Pat this
on my cheap burns for a nice flush so
because we did add a tiny bit of
coverage before this is kind of just
like bringing back that rosiness right
here so here we have the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys liked it I
actually loved how it turned out super
natural but still put together and it's
obviously only going to take you like
ten minutes which is incredible I love
you guys so much don't forget to

already and I'll see you in my next
video
