today here in LA and we just woke up got
ready and we're gonna head to breakfast
so ever since we got here we've been
eating quite unhealthy so we want to go
to an organic like little cafe or
something hopefully we can find an acai
ball because I really miss those back
home and then for lunch I'll be eating
something unhealthy again alright so
let's go so I just want to talk about
the event that I went to the two-faced
bitch party event it was so much fun I
met a lot of youtubers I met many of
James Charles MS Laura Lee she was so
nice everyone that I met was like really
incredibly nice so in fact so Ricky
we're going to beaming let's see what
this is like it's like healthy
everything so I have here my acai ball
with Gucci berries strawberries and
bananas how is it closed again
is it better than Australian ones dad it
it tastes really good
but it's really different back home
which is nice for a change
alright so we all know wait - might pop
you haven't seen the card - is getting
just let us see what it looks like and
then we're going to go to a king pool
and get some photos
yeah chronic painful feel I hate people
but actually in a moment okay wait a
second
we just found half of CB I usually shop
here online it's really weird to be here
in person
oh my god they have amazing clothes here
oh my god the whole time I've been like
acting normal I have really stayed on my
teeth then I just saw a mirror and like
oh my god it's just so embarrassing okay
so we are in - now it's so pretty here -
look quiet so it's a little good so we
made it to famous pink wall we got so
many photos and it looks so cool
so I'm going to go over to the other
side of the street and get some more
photos with just like a white wall doing
it for the gram you know but it's fun I
love taking photos what's the update we
are being as
there's a line at morphe brushes but
we're going to wait it out I think you
just so I'm just going to grab some
Christmas presents for people because I
don't I'm shipping so I may as well do
it while I'm here I'm excited just watch
everything in real life instead of just

size and so I spent $200 and I got quite
a bit of stuff so let's see okay so we
have a true Z palette here I already
have some coming from one know wherever

get these four because you never have
too many detail it's double-sided and
the extra large then I got this color
switch which cleans your brushes if you
like need it done quickly and then I got
all these makeup brushes it'll look
amazing
I especially bought a lot of these
