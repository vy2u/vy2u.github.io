channel so in today's video I'm doing a
really nice fresh natural makeup look I
just feel like looking really good with
not lack Cape face look you know lean so
let's do this together I'm going to
start out with my eyebrows so I'm using
an eyebrow powder today because that's
just what I find is easiest to you so
this one is the Anastasia brow powder in
soft brown so I'm just going to start by
making my arch a little bit higher
I want the brows to still look nice and
natural but still defined and then the
next step is I like to make them a
little bit longer and then I fill them
in underneath just to add a little bit
more definition and that is pretty much
all with whatever is left on the brush I
just like to like fluff it through the
front of my brow just very quickly I'm
going to define my eyebrows with some
concealer so I'm taking the sa water
Double Wear concealer in the shade
light/medium warm so I'm just going to
take a little flat shader brush and
carve up right under here to make it
look a little bit neater because they
asked through the mask at the moment and
then I'm going to use it to prime my
eyelids as well because I have a lot of
veins happening on there okay so the
eyes are primed now let's go in with a
tiny bit of eyeshadow just to add a bit
of definition so I'm going to go in with
the juvies place eyes shadow palette
this one is the nubian palette it has
some beautiful colors in here look at
this it's like warm heaven is our panel
so I'm going to take this color right
here and just pop this right in my
crease with a really big fluffy blending
brush literally going to take few
seconds so as you can see right here it
looks just a little bit better with a
touch of color but not too much new uni
now let's move on to the base so we
cannot really prospect the skin so I'm
taking the Gemological skin perfect pry
light and this one has SPF 30 in it
which is amazing for daytime so I'm just
going to put a little bit on the back of
my hand and then work it into my skin
the reason why I love this one is
because actually is good for your skin
it's not like donating harmful EUR and
it makes your makeup look incredible or
whether brush please this one is amazing
because it blurs out the skin like your
skin literally looks so airbrushed so
this one has a lot of antioxidants in it
to stimulate collagen and high
raishin see as you can see right here my
skin looks really healthy and glowy but
when we put the foundation and
everything over the top it's going to be
super matte so the makeup can stay on it
for a really long time so let's move on
to the foundation because I've been
loving one in particular and I'm really
excited to use it again it is my little
baby my hourglass advantage foundation
stick I use a little tent I use a shade
a warm beige all the time and I love it
so much it's like the perfect neutral
shade can look so good I love it so I'm
just going to paint this around my face
this has amazing coverage and I just
like icon it over it it's so easy to
work with I'm just going to buff this
into my skin with a flat top kabuki
brush would you look at this my skin
looks so for us right now okay sorry so
the concealer I'm going to use that same
one from Estee Lauder and I'm just going
to place this under my eyes and blend it
out with my bu a blender
literally I hate when eyeshadow palettes
don't have a mirror image okay let's
bounce away everyone says that like i
vant for way too fast looks like I'm
speeded up sooner I just do it every day
so I'm kind to it now to bake underneath
my eyes I'm going in with the s-bahn
loose face powder I love this because
it's super affordable and it just
lateral a melts into the skin so I'm
just taking a bit on my Beauty Blender
I'm looking off and just turning it on
and then just set the rest of my face
I'm taking be a bare minerals bear Pro
foundation powder in a shade a natural
11 I'm just going to take a little bit
of this and just Pat it over my
foundation so we can set it I'm just
going to take a little bit of that
transition shade and put this on my
lower lash line so we can kind of like
even out the whole and sharing situation
that's more definition down the world
because I don't have any lashes so we
need something down there to my right
was taking that on a little blending
brush and a brushing it from outer
corner to inner corner oh my gosh guys
I'm going to be in Bali by the time you
guys are watching this and I'm so
excited so make sure you head over to my
Instagram so you can see what's going on
it's shiny grinning oh my gosh I just
love traveling so much okay so now the
last thing full of the eye shutter I'm
going to take this color right here just
for a little
of shimma on the inner corner just looks
like you know a bit of glory but not too
much time for the lashes I'm going to go
in with some mascara I'm going to really
coat my top and bottom lashes but I
would put Folgers what anyway I feel
equatable I literally love making my
lower lashes oh my god I have to shake
for the head coffee and it's like going
everywhere but I love making my lower
lashes look really spidery now time for
the lashes I'm taking these ones of
right here which are so pretty I think
they're like perfect for that natural
look oh there we go finally got in focus
and these ones are in this gel it's
Daisy from karach pure lashes cure are
as you can see like it's only a natural
pop of lash it's not too much the next
step is to bronze up the face of it so
I'm going in with the BH Cosmetics satin
that bronzer and this one's in the shade
a tropical can I love this so much for a
really nice bronzy glow so I'm just
going to put this on my cheekbones with
a little stippling brush this one is
literally amazing that's like ten
dollars I'm also going to bring it up
around my forehead as well for more
color there and then also on wood you'll
learn all kind of blends into one oh my
god I nearly forgot this step and I do
it all the time I love it this is the
benefit of Ready Set Radice on just a
clear brow gel and it just makes the
brows look serve bully my so I'm just
going to push them up let them feel like
that oh my god that is amazing I'm still
excited to do this one so this one is
the blush like you make me blush by dose
of colors in the shade amazement looks
stunning so this sounds like a Coralie
peachy shade with a lot of gold flecks
in it of shimmer just going to put these
on the apples of my cheeks but I feel
like blush just makes any makeup look
very natural you know with a nice
natural flush of color yes I got a new
all my goodness oh my gosh I've got a
new highlight it's from Bobbi Brown in
the shade pink glow Chloe told me to buy
this but oh my God look how amazing that
looks look at that oh my god it looks
like silk like a little silk
let's do this
I mean it's pretty but like an evil
that's so beautiful it's very finely
milled which is why I love these
highlighter so it doesn't look really
like chalk it just looks like a nice
glow I might just go with a lip gloss on
the lips today so I'm going to take the
dose of colors undressed lip gloss and
we're going to pop this over my lips I
already have a lip balm on now just a
lot and it looked a little bit
oh sorry pigmented which is amazing just
for a little bit of color around my lips
I'm going to take the ndk 24/7 at GLAAD
on lip pencil I use isn't everybody I
like my bad these ones in the shade up
tight the last step is to go in with
makeup setting spray and I'm taking the
Glenn blur glow set up and makeup
setting spray and I'm super excited for
this one because I've actually never
used it I bought it in the mail like two
days ago when you test out a spritzer
