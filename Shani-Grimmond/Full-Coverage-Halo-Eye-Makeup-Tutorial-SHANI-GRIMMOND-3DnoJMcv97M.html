doing well
so let's go ahead and jump straight into
this makeup tutorial so first thing I'm
doing is priming my eyes with the mac
pro longwear concealer as per usual just
so we can start off our I shadow with a
blank canvas then of course I'm taking a
pressed powder to make sure that base
isn't tacky at all now it's time to rock
and roll for my eyeshadow today I'm
taking this Tarte TARDIS pro eyeshadow
palette so I'm picking up a and Lobby
purple shade and this one's going right
in my crease so we can kind of let all
the other colors blend into this one so
I'm just taking a really big fluffy
brush and popping it from outer corner
to inner corner and really blowing it up
nice and high next I'll be taking this
other purple shade and this one is going
in the same place as we put a last one
the last shade was a little bit too grey
for my liking so I just went over the
top with this one I was pretty much just
playing around with different colors so
the next one I'm taking is a burgundy
shade and again going straight over the
top so we can get the color that I want
and I'm also just going to make sure I
blend out the tops of my eyeshadow so
it's nice and soft and blown out now
let's move on to the lid so we can
create the halo I am taking that second
transition shade and popping that on the
outer corner and the inner corner of my
lid then I'm going in with this violet
Voss glitter glue and popping that
directly in the middle now I'm going to
take this a mineral velvet shadow and
I'm popping that right in the middle
where it belongs and then I'm going to
blend out these sighs my eye shape isn't
the best for this kind of eye shadow
technique but I'm like I'm going to try
it and I think it turned out pretty well
considering the horridness going on now
let's move on to the base so I'm
starting off with the two-faced hangars
of primer and just smacking this on this
is on my favorite primers because it is
really moisturizing at the same time
then we're going in with this strobe
cream I used way too much of this so by
the end of the video my face looks a
little bit too oily so if you do use is
I just recommend using it on the high
points of your face and where you don't
naturally produce wheels but that was my
first mistake now going in with the Make
Up For Ever HD stick foundation
I know this is our origins like I know
it before I was even applying it but
this is the only shade that I have and I
really really wanted to test out the
formula I love the formula so much
obviously it's just way too orange for
me what is actually happening but I made
it work by the end of the video so just
stippling this all over my face carving
out my brows and then finishing off by
blending it all the way down to my
boobies for concealer I'm going in with
the Maybelline fit me and I'm using this
to highlight my face and make it look
less orange isn't that weird to think
that it actually looks normal by the end
of the video what is genius so just
putting this under my eyes and down the
center of my face and blending that out
with a Beauty Blender the Beauty Blender
blends out concealer like a dream if you
don't have one I would definitely
recommend it and a tip of the day and
make sure you wet it before you use it
so now let's go in and set that
concealer I'm taking the Kat Von D
translucent powder and just putting this
directly underneath my eyes to make sure
it does not crease throughout the day
because every single look conceal our
creases on me so this just completely
stops it now let's go in and set the
rest of the face um okay I need to slip
thing on I'm really sorry I don't know
why I just started saying that a lot so
pretty much just going to go in all over
my face with this and I was like why is
my face was shining and then I realized
the strobe cream that's what it was it
was too shiny for me alright let's go
ahead and finish the eyes so I'm taking
the shade in there filter and this is
going on a lower lashline really
generously going from the outer corner
to the inner corner and really fluffing
it out then taking the shade at nylon by
neck oh my god dude I just came back oh
by Mac I'm using this to highlight my
inner corners this is the perfect
highlight shade for the eyes I love it
and then for mascara I'm taking this
benefit a roller lash mascara putting
this all over my top and bottom lashes
so we can prep them full of falsies and
when you just tell you these were the
worst falsies I've ever applied to Ben
was so thick and it honestly took me ten
minutes each eye for them to actually
stick down I don't know what brand they
were there were Michaels and I'm like
hey I'm going to use these never again
Michael
no but anyway let's move on to the face
I'm taking the toothpaste sweet peach
glow palette and I'm starting with D at
bronzy shade I'm using this to carve out
my cheeks a little bit because my 10 was
so dark it wasn't showing up as much as
I'd hurt so I also went in with the at
Mac mineralized skinfinish in the shade
it gives me some because why not make my
skin even a more orange so I'm putting
this on my cheekbones and also around my
forehead as well and then I'm taking the
blush from the same palette and going on
in on the apples of my cheeks and
blending it back now it's time to make
my face glow so I'm taking my Anastasia
highlight brush which by the way is my
favorite highlight brush of all times
you guys are need to get it if you don't
have it already and I'm just packing
that highlighter on and it is so pretty
it's such a universal shade that I think
will match so many skin tones now it's
time for liquid lipstick I literally
tried like 20 different lipsticks I'm
annoyed and Kinning and then my friend
came over and she's like hey you should
try the kylie jenner malibu shade and
turns out of this works perfectly so the
last thing I'm doing is setting my face
with the Urban Decay long lasting spray
I put literally the whole bottle on
there my bad but yeah there we have the
finished a makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did please give
it a big big big big thumbs up I love
you guys and I will see you in my next
video Tolu darling ba ba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
