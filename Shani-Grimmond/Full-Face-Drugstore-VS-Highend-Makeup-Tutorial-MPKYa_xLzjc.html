channel so in today's video I'm doing a
half my face with drugstore and then
half my face with high-end so we're
going to find some amazing at juice for
you guys today
you don't need a lot of money to take
good makeup like that's the bottom line
so this video is going to prove that so
I hope you guys enjoy today's here and
let's go ahead and jump riding let's
start with the eye brows at so usual so
I'm going to do my drugstore side on
this side right here and then my
high-end side on this side so I'm going
to take the chichi brow pomade in the
shade medium brown and then on the other
side I'm taking the Tarte Amazonian clay
waterproof brow mousse and this one's in
the shade taupe I would have to say that
the chichi product is a little bit
harder to work with just because the
product is a little bit more wet so you
have more room for mistakes because you
can slip and slide everywhere but the
Tarte one it's like a little bit more
dry but it's still really easy to apply
they're both really good products so so
all I'm doing is just making my eyebrows
a little bit more symmetrical because
naturally they literally don't even look
related and then to carve out my
eyebrows that the two concealers that I
have here are the benefits fit me
concealer in the shade 10 and also the
Too Faced Born This Way in the shade at
light/medium these two shades are nearly
identical and these are both like
amazing really lightweight concealer and
I really like both of them so hello
possible that was actually a little hard
to carve out my brows with just because
it was so watery that can feel it but it
turned out pretty good yeah this one was
definitely a little bit easier to carve
out the brows with let's move on to the
eyeshadow so for the drugstore side I'm
taking this palette from the balm this
one is so beautiful and is only true
brands that I like from the drugstore
when it comes to the eyeshadows and that
is chichi and the balm so that's all I'm
really working with today
the first color that I'm going to take
is called match blue pen this one right
here and this is going to straight in
the crease the bomb is sold at Target
where I live so I don't know drugstore I
don't these shadows honestly work just
as well as high-end products I'm
obsessed and then for the high-end side
I'm taking the dose of colors that baked
brown eyeshadow this palette is on
another
level of pigmented like it's insane I
don't know how many words so I'm going
to take this color right here and then
it's going the crease again you mean you
actually I'm going to take this color
that's a bit closer that's completely
different shade see ya wouldn't want to
be ya then back to the drugstore side
I'm going in with the chichi spices
palette and I'm picking up this warm
brown color right here and that's going
in the crease I'm just taking that on a
little type of learning brush back on
the high-end side I'm going in with that
same dosa colors palette and taking this
rich cranberry color and do the same
thing just tapping off a lot of excess
product because well and then just to
add a little speck of a darkness I'm
going to take a dis color from the balm
palette in this color from the dirt the
colors color and I'm just going to take
a little tapered brush and really work
that right in the crease just barely
touching it I'm going to do a little bit
of a cut crease I'm going to go in with
these two concealers again and work my
magic okay so the next step is to go in
with matte white eye shadows right over
the top so I'm going to take this shade
and pack her on and there's also a white
shade in the difficult salad I just did
a really rough job of the cut crease
because I'm put glitter in there as well
oh my god I'm actually scared for my
life so I'm going to do a little bit of
white eyeliner right there okay oh I
might run this whole makeup look so on
one side we have the NYX liquid liner
and then on the other side we have the
Too Faced liquid art eyeliner
let's get to work on through that I'm
pretty sure this one takes a while to
dry so it's going to take a while
oh my god this white one is literally
like impossible to use from today no I'm
sorry but I honestly have to use the NYX
one on this side because it's just not
as opaque I mean that's amazing news
that right
oh no I've completely stuffed this one
up it's like lower hmm okay so it looks
like when I do that I'm just going to go
over the top on both sides with the
Urban Decay heavy metal glitter liner
this is like the only two steps that I'm
going to do that aren't drugstore and
high and I just really want to make it
look cute now for the mascara I have the
bomb what's your type of scar and also
the Bobbi Brown what even is this the
smokey eye masks are these ones are both
so amazing this one really separates the
lashes and this one's super wet so it
makes your lashes massive oh my god see
they're both incredible and they pretty
much both look the exact same
I'm still we've started to move on to
the face so we have the dough line what
even is this core it's a radiance
concentrate with a pure gold flecks in
it and then we have the wet wild this
primer what they both have very
different like consistencies this one
feels exactly just like a moisturizer
and this one's more like a gel
consistency it's super light it feels
nice and refreshing and oh my god it
smells incredible my mother's it looks
like you're actually rich now thank you
hosting foundation time so on the
drugstore side we have the Milani
conceal and perfect two in one this
one's going to shade a room beige and I
also have the hourglass vanish sticks
and a ssin also in the shade warm beige
girl so let's start with the drug stool
I really like it when it's suitable
coverage it blends really easily have
any clean brushes that's a problem I'd
have to use a new brush I haven't used
the felicity morphe y72 try this I love
this color so much so as you can see
it's covered everything really nicely it
has a beautiful finish just going to rub
off the excess foundation I haven't used
this one in such a long time it's going
to blend that in with
rush because it is a really sick formula
going back in with their concealers the
Maybelline of fit me into first I'm just
going to blend that out with my Beauty
Blender that's amazing I would say that
they're both just as good as each other
except this one is a little bit lighter
so I really need to go in and set that
down with translucent powder before it
creases so I have the S by Matt loose
face powder at the drugstore and then
the Allah prairie cellular treatment a
loose powder this one is so expensive I
used it like three times like what do
you mean that's going in with the powder
that is literally like $12 and it is so
good I wait forget about this one in the
other side I would just have to save the
look a little prairie ones melts like
and on the bottom like stuttering so bad
it's like melts into the skin like
literally straightaway you can't really
see it which is really good and then for
the face powder I have the Maybelline
fit me matte and salt
oh my god why do I keep bringing
something out my word man pull us in 220
and MD benefit hello flawless in a shade
of champagne this one by benefit will
like forever be my favorite palette in
the world this one that still is really
good but I just feel like B that benefit
one is just like nothing that's going to
be as good as that but I always set my
face down so everything over the top
like the legs are nice and smoothly go
in with my little baby I don't know why
I love it so much it just like works so
well on my skin it looks so nice and
makeup stays on it beautifully when I
set my face is now to set the eyebrows
on at the drugstore side I'm going in
with the tip my brow by Australis in the
shade light brown I've loved this liner
for so many years you just have to kind
of like brush off the excess product cuz
a lot comes out you but really careful
I'm just going to use this to brush my
brows upwards this one's super
affordable it just separates every
single brow and makes your brow looks so
full and then the other side amusing be
a 3d brow turned by benefit in shade
number two benefits brow products will
always be like up there with my favorite
products this one pretty much just does
the same thing now for the
lashline i'm going to go into with the
dark brown colors from outer corner to
inner corner just going to keep that on
a little angled brush and then I'll go
in with a lot of shade just underneath
it so it kind of blends down into that
color and then of course same on the
other side you can definitely tell that
this side is a lot more pigmented so
what I'm going to do now is go in and do
my mascara with the drugstore high-end
and then I'm going to put on some
falsies and I'll be back girl it is time
for the bronze that I'm feeling like my
face is a little bit orange compared to
my neck but we're going to make that
worker very seen so we have the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and
also the hoola bronzer by benefit so
let's start with the drugstore side
everyone loves this product right here
so I mean oh my god I just inhaled that
my god kind of forget how this one goes
but you really have to build it up see
that looks really nice and then on the
other side I'm taking a touch of the
benefit this one's super pigmented as
you guys probably know I love a really
glowy cheekbone so on the drugstore side
I'm taking the wet and wild
Fergie centerstage collection this is in
the shade a rose gold and got it I'm
just going to pop a little bit of this
over my contouring shade that's actually
so beautiful I put this around my
hairline as well that's such a pretty
glory and on the other side I'm going in
with the Todd Park Avenue princess
Amazonian clay bronzer this one's a
little bit more on the brown side rather
than like the orange ooo tones but I
really like this one as well it
literally looks like I rub my face in
dirt oh my god I haven't used a benefit
bronzer in so long so that happy 20
towards now it's time for the blush so
I'm taking be at Jordana blush in the
shade at rose silk and then the max lush
in the shade blush baby from the center
use the same bronzer brush that I just
use and put this on the apples of my
cheeks just very lightly because I do
want to do a red lip have I done that in
so long
I love the Mac blush is so beautiful and
if your ghana blushes are
really good as well first argument is it
is time for the highlighter so we have
the wet and wild and mega glow
illuminating a pallet this one's in a
shade at catwalk pink this one is sorry
beautiful and there's a few different
shade you can choose from and then the
high-end one is the Geo a highlight in a
shade of rose gold this one is one of my
all-time favorite highlighters it's so
beautiful alright let's start with the
high-end side oh absolutely
take your yellow week-old and then on
the other side I'm going to use this
shade right here one do you guys like
that off I feel like this one's kind of
prettier I'm super yellow isn't it
alright a red lipstick time I haven't
done this in two so freakin long so we
have the Mac liquid lipstick in the
shade self-serve grand and the
colour-pop ultra matte lip in the shade
creep up that's a great look isn't it
ker to show you how big red lipstick
makes your lips look I much prefer the
color pop applicator this one's really
weird now it's time for the setting
spray we have the neck surgery a
finishing mist so refreshing and then on
the other side we have the Marc Jacobs
recover perfecting creaking upsetting
mist now this one left white dots on my
face last time so I've got to be really
careful okay let's dots again this is
like fences anyways here we have the
finished makeup look let's go ahead and
have a little closer look at the face to
see what really looks different so I'm
going to lie I kind of like the
drugstore side better like a lot better
the liquid lipstick was so much easier
to apply so I was looking it was just so
much better the bronzer the blush
actually no the blush looks like the
same on both sides but like the brother
in a highlighter was kind of like better
on this side I definitely like to talk
eyebrow products set off the eye shadows
works amazing this one
kind of like easier to blend out but
these ones were just sort of battery and
beautiful everything else was like
really good oh my god I which we went
crazy on that cool lot less being
careful if you have that I do this in
