channel start in today's video I'm just
going to be playing around with some new
makeup and you're catching up with you
guys because it's been so long since
I've uploaded well it's only been a week
but still I feel like we have a lot of
things to catch up on because I've been
doing so much this week and I thought it
would be fun to share it with you so
let's go ahead and jump into this makeup
look I have like a million new products
just right down here to play with so
let's do this so let's start with the
eye shadow I'm going to go in with this
new poet from the balm and I'm going to
pick up this shade right here on my
little fluffy brush so where do I even
start
what have I been doing so my friend
Michael came down for I think like a
week or was it like two weeks or
something so that's why I didn't feel on
when other people are here I feel so bad
so then cuz it takes like a whole day to
like get one video done but we went to
Justin Beiber it was amazing
like here's that hot are you
serious I was getting so frustrated
because he was like so far away I was
like why do far away Jo like come down
here please venom I'd love to meet him
would be so cool
but how funny is it the whole like thing
that's happening would like the
paparazzi and stuff and he's like slack
off like honestly me period that's what
I would do if I was getting followed
around so much and harassed by people
like what do you mean so what can you do
first impressions of these eyeshadows
they're amazing they're blending up so
nicely
they're very pigmented and I literally
can't believe that these are considered
a drugstore brand you can get them at
Target you serious okay so the next
shade that I'm going to take is this
middle brown right here and I'm just
going to put this in the crease to
deepen it up I really want to do a kind
of daytime look today just because I'm
going to look at a new place because our
lease is nearly up mine and Jonathan so
we are going to move into a bigger place
so obviously I need to look presentable
for that and I haven't done like a
daytime look in a while I'm honestly so
sick of living in this apartment so
small if you guys lived here you'd
probably be like get me out of here it's
like being locked up in a little shoebox
if I open the door
you can hear all of the like building of
apartments and so loud so I have to
keep the doors closed when I'm filming
and like when I'm just chillin if I want
quiet so yeah that's why we don't want
to extend a lease because that
obviously I need to stop swearing
that's what happens when I don't film
for a while just get into a habit I got
a bunch of new elf products and this is
the eyeshadow palette that I got
school-to-prison I shadow palette and
the colors are so pretty they're like
rosy gold shades and they're all
shimmery so what should we do in the lid
to Jamie I might take this one right
here and I'm just going to pack this all
over my lids I just put some fix+ on my
brush because this needs to be smaller
pigmented let's go in hunch
I might just Chuck's know that dark
brown on my outer corner here just sir
Luke is still pretty let's move on to
the face so I'm going to go in with this
Tarte America's oil I've seen so many
people put oil on their face before
foundation and it looks so pretty it
just makes your skin look really soft
and hydrated so I'm just going to put a
few drops on my face usually I put this
on before bed to really like make my
skin hydrated because I do have dry skin
so if you do have oily skin I'm not sure
if this is going to work like dry to
normal and then for Roma or better shake
it up so watery it's the Australis Prime
at the original videos I'm just gonna
put a little bit on the back of my hand
oh it looks very still attorney it kind
of smells a bit funky but it does feel
really nice going onto the skin it's
nice and hydrating easy to blend and
anything that keeps the makeup on longer
and I just picked up the Giorgio Armani
a power fabric high coverage foundation
and I'm super excited to try it out
because I've heard some good things
about it I love the original Giorgio
Armani foundation - its Kim Ewing red I
know if you guys can see about whatever
that primer and my skin just like flamed
up a little bit so I got a shade 6.5
this is a different color range to the
original Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation so I'm hoping this line that
matches my skin whoo very runny just
applying that with a Beauty Blender
oh I love putting foundation on oh the
color is really nice so far so good it
does not feel heavy on my face at all
and it's looking very natural but
absolutely stunning at the same time the
first thing that I'm noticing is you can
definitely see what's happening under
the skin still so it's not like a full
coverage it's a higher cover foundation
but I'd say it's like a medium the next
product that I'm going to try out is
this concealer from wet and wild it is
called cover all and it is in the shade
811 on the glow I'm scared to try this
because it was so so cheap so I could
ruin my whole book and makeup let's do
this
alright let's blend it in with my PD
blender if it wants to blend no it
doesn't want to blend cool oh my god
honestly I'd rather put foundation under
my eyes and then put that under there
ever again like ever oh my god I can't
I'm just going to put a little bit of
the top shape tape under there because
that's just not happening honestly oh
that one's so much better
alright let's move on to setting
underneath the eyes I'm going to take
the chichi real minerals finishing
powder so this is a translucent powder
and I'm just going to use this to make
underneath my eyes if this has flash
back you'll hear about it trust me going
in wish me luck
I didn't realize how many new products
that I have but the next thing that I
have is from the balm it is a powder
foundation and I'm in a shade medium so
I'm just going to go ahead and pack this
on my face let's see if it adds a bit of
extra coverage if I don't see it adding
any coverage but it definitely feels
like it's setting in it ah oh my god all
of that foundation that was on my nerves
just like left the building like
it's gone it's a subsea by I'm just
going to brush away all this translucent
powder onto my eyes and so far I really
liked it was it a good job I was in a
white class it's not taking away any
foundation now for the lower lash line
I'm just going to take this pink color
and take it from
the quantity in a corner okay maybe
there is a little bit of a weight class
in my eyes shut up okay so first a pink
color undertaking a big blending brush
because I want to be nice and blown out
and lastly just putting that chocolate
brown on the outer third of my level -
Maureen while we're on the ID still I am
going to take this shade right here from
that elf palette and just highlight my
inner corners I love a little bit of a
glow on the inner corners Gorge now it's
time to mascara I'm taking this mascara
from a 5th Avenue I saw this that came
out I think it was and I was like never
had a spread but the wand does look
really good because it's like that
plastic benefit looking one so I'm just
going to coat my lashes well it's
working really well like it's got a lot
of product coming out onto the lashes
which I love oh my god the mascara just
went all over my skin under my eyes
because it's really wet so it is
transferred so if you are going to use
it be really careful when you're doing a
lower lashes and like not look down
because it's going to transfer so
anyways let's move on to falsies I'm
going to use these lines from ardell
these are the natural whiskies yep yeah
it's demi wispies look at these gorgeous
lashes perfect for daytime because
they're tipple ight but they still are
nice langston volume I finally fixed
this whole situation on my face of the
mascara now I'm just going to pop on
some lashes all this is so little it
honestly so easy to put on let's contour
the face so I'm going to use this a wet
and wild contouring palette and I'm just
going to take this a dark shade I've
heard that this is like a really
pigmented so I'm just going to pick up
literally the smallest bit and then tap
it off so I'm just going to contour a
little bit oh that's a really nice color
now to bronze up my skin I'm going to
take this Inglot bronzing powder in the
shade 74 I have never tried any products
from Inglot except for that pigment so
let's see how this goes I'm just going
to take this brush from Real Techniques
as a blush brush it's so good for
bronzer Oh
oh that's through pigmented I love the
color it's like the perfect sunkissed
look I love it I love it a limit and
take this on the motorway and get rid of
that double chin see our touch on the
flipside hon and also around my forehead
as well for a bit of color up there with
that same wet and wild palette I'm just
going to pick up that really light shade
and just clean up under here a tiny bit
cuz you know me I always like to go
overboard now it's time to blush so I'm
going to take this and mix what is this
baked blush illuminator and bronzer
ashore hum that literally just looks
like a blush pink
hmm it is very shimmery though so it's
going to add mashed into cheeps I'm
hoping I don't know if I've used this I
don't think I have whoo all the next
flashes that I've used are very
pigmented considering how many cheap
they are feels like six dollars or
something or six dollars in America but
like twelve dollars in Australia typical
racism you could never let me down oh my
gosh I'm so excited for this next part
you guys ready sorry I'm going to use
the Anastasio no collagen railroad
pallet guerrero store Emma that I think
I'm going to use glue again up because
it's like a really nice goal and I don't
really have many cold
Helena's I'm going to use a fan brush
cause I honestly haven't used one in so
long so let's see what this looks like
oh ma girl that is so pigmented I was
gonna do a bit more some extra spark oh
my god that's beautiful
I have swatch seeds on my arm before and
they were like that pigmented that I'm
like I don't even think I can use a
brush that's like really dense because
it's going to be way too much but with
the fan brush it looks really nice if
you like a subtle highlight literally
don't go anywhere near this palette it
is the most intense highlight I've
honestly ever ever used in my life the
next product that I'm going to take is
this elf product I don't know it's cool
because they never have like the name on
it but it is in the shade blushing Rose
I'm assuming it's like a
a velvet lip or some sort of lip stick
in a cretin pool there I mean because
this is a daytime look I want to do like
something nice in neutral oh look at
them nice flow this is like a really
nice purpley love everyday color I like
it
I am literally obsessed with this lip
color it drives like really mad it's so
comfortable to wear and I'm so shocked
right now it's that good oh I'm just
going to go over my eyebrows with this
tinted brow gel by Melo cosmetics I
always like to brush my brows straight
up so they look fuller this looks really
good I love this I mean well so far it
was like get ahead of myself there's
definitely a lot of hits and messes with
elf but like this lip product is so good
I know I've used a lot of alpha new to
the area and like the balm but they just
sent me a package so I so animate well
try that Miss video so I can switch out
the products that I use and stuff so
lastly I'm just going to take this elf
and makeup and mist set I bought this on
myself the other day so let's see how
this goes I'm going to make sure I'm
spraying it from my cooler back here oh
so that we have the finished makeup look
I hope you guys like it I actually love
how it turned out I feel like it's
perfect for a daytime look although I
would wait it at nighttime as well mmm
can't get over this all of the
eyeshadows because all of the eyeshadows
were amazing I'm so impressed with the
balm and also like how people in Tibet
elf product was like the bronzer is
going to be one of my favorites I can
already tell because that really nice
orange color I love orange takes the
highlight of hood I'm going to use that
all the time if you guys don't have that
in a cold jhiera pellet I'm guerreiro
 I'm so bad at pronouncing names I
would definitely recommend getting it
what else do we have going on the demi
whispies are amazing I'm just so happy
with how this book turned out so if you

up oh my god wait please don't get that
under eye concealer anyways give this
