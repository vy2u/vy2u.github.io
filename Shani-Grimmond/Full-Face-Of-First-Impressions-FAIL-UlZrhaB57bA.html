in today's video I'm doing a full face
of first impressions I honestly didn't
even think I had this much new makeup
and I was just going through my join on
Michaels video should i film and my holy
 actually have a lot of new makeup
so let's go ahead and jump in as per
usual and starting off with it my
eyebrows so today I'm using the Sephora
eyebrow editor and I have two shade
medium brown so I always use I wrap
powders I just feel like that's so much
easier to use and anything else
girl so I'm just going to brush my
eyebrows up and I'm going to take the
chocolate brown shade right here and I'm
just going to start filling in these
slugs
I mean first impression I wouldn't say
it has pigmented and rich as like the
other powders that I use like the
benefit browsing and my Garbo and Kelly
one oh my god I feel like the colors
like red like it's white you will turn
for my brows now I'm going to conceal my
eyelid so I'm taking the elf eyelid
primer I think that's what's cool they
never have names on it but I do know
that it's in the shade nude linen I'm
actually so nervous about this like I
use this as a lipstick last time like
not the shade I had a pair for one of
these I literally thought it was a
lipstick sorry so I'm just going to put
this all over my lid and hope that it
covers everything on there I mean it's
blending out really well and it's
covering everything so I'm really
impressed with how that looks on my
eyelids it does a really really good job
and it doesn't really look like it needs
to be sat down but I'm going to do it
anyway just in case oh my god so I'm
setting it down and my eyelid looks so
texturized ah looks like an old grandmas
eyelid like no offense but stuck now
let's move on to the eyeshadow so I'm
taking the bare Naturals at bare
minerals eyeshadow palette and I think I
have in mind what I should have look I'm
going to do we do have a very like
unique selection of colors you can
definitely do like the basic gold smokey
eye and like the
look some stuff little these lighter
colors but I really want to try like a
smokey eye with this really nice and
navy blue down here so to start that off
because I'm going to make it cool tone
because I always do wrong turns I'm
going to start with this like gray color
right here and I'm just going to pop
that in my crease so the navy can blend
into this color so just taking a little
blending brush and working that in
circular motions first impression it is
pretty pigmented nothing like out of the
world but it is applying really nicely
oh my god I could literally sit here for
like two weeks and keep blending it's
still not moving
mmm I guess this is like the best we can
do it's honestly like not learning I'm
sick of it whatever the next flower I'm
taking is this Navy black II kind of
color out here and I'm just going to
blend this into my crease birth and I'm
going to put it all over my lid it does
have a fusion is another okay so now to
puck it all over my lid well I just got
rid of the old I show on this brush so
it has makeup remover on it now it's
like sore pigmented like honestly I'm so
over blending it's not even blending
whatever I'm just going to take a makeup
remover wipe and just clean up the edges
of that and also under my eyes actually
I think there's any fallout in there
which is one good thing about it now
it's time for the base so I'm going in
with the other decay optical illusion
complexion Reimer this one is a
smoothing primer and it has a row tip
and argan oil is a pore perfecting so
I'm really glad to see how this one goes
this came in like a beauty loot bag from
mecca when I was buying heaps of stuff
so hopefully it's good just like them by
the school size but this is a pretty
generous amount the first thing that I
have to say is that it reminds me of the
benefit Porefessional like it feels very
similar like very silicone II once you
blend it in it like fits in nicely to
the skin I've literally heard a million
people talk about this foundation from a
Lancome it is the 24 hour ultra wear
foundation
and I have the shade they were full and
really hurt because it matches me
because any like drugstore foundation I
find like so stressful to match because
they're so expensive
so you want them to match practically so
I'm just going to pump them on the back
of my hand there was a full pump I'm a
cake say it's like going and it's going
to go ahead and blend that in with my
Beauty Blender oh my god it smells like
really strong I don't really like to
smell of it actually the coverage isn't
very high at all outside like a light
sand medium coverage
I know this is pretty full coverage
foundation anything like it oxidize in a
little bit look my face is getting more
orange as we go I would have say I'm
like completely blown away which is like
kind of sad let's try and fix this a
mess heart with some concealer so I'm
going to go in with the essence all I
need concealer palette and I'm going to
mix these troops and shades together
actually no I think I'll just use this
one here maybe a touch of that because
my face is like so dark but just going
to put my Beauty Blender on top of that
Verlander in although nothing's coming
up in my DVD bundle what do you mean I
feel like it doesn't have a lot of
coverage it just got a little bit ashy
but it's not the worst concealer I've
ever tried
I mean essence is super cheap so
whatever I'm just baking and setting my
face because I don't have a new new
products for this step and now for the
lower lash line I'm going to take this
color that would put it all over the lid
and going from addict wants in a corner
I mean and Mazal the in terms it's like
my face looks like this morning now for
my waterline I'm going to take this
white eyeliner from benefits called
highbrow or I don't know if epsilon to
the brow boy
sounds like it okay I went to put that
in my waterline because I feel like my
eyes have a look like I was like being
punched in the head so I'm just going to
use this for that oh my god that's so
pigmented
now time for the mascara I'm taking this
one from essence it's called the false
lashes mascara the Wonder looks pretty
good like it's really small and I feel
like it's going to get into all my
little crevices so let's give it a shot
yeah I really love you sexually
my oh my I saw anglers and that benefit
thing oh okay this is like one of those
videos where like everything goes wrong
and I'm literally not doing anything
different
all right so I just put them some false
lashes and it's looking a little bit
better but like oh of course
anyway so let's move on to the next new
product that I have this one's from Naz
and is the casino Rosa and looks like
this it just does not fit into a door
somewhere watch it and you can literally
hardly care but I'm going to try to give
it a chance
I'm going to use a really dense brush so
what's comes out onto the brush just
going to use this to contour my cheeks
bronze it up a little
wow it definitely isn't very pigmented
considering the brush I'm using it does
have a nice color though next product
I'm using is the BH Cosmetics satin
bronzer in the shade a tropical tan from
very shimmery so I'm just going to put a
really small amount on my cheekbones for
a little bit of a glow but I'm so
excited that I have like a bronzy shade
that's like affordable now so I'm going
to put heels down my neck because we're
next week Brown it needs to like Lodi
orange obvious I knew today cream you
kidding so I have a new blush palette
from a chichi this is called the
Immaculate ombre bullet but the last
collection it looks so pretty I could
this one up from Target so as you can
see all of these ones here ombre look so
beautiful so the color that I'm going to
take is I think this one and then I'm
either over the top of this one it is so
beautiful and shimmery and then these
ones that match I really do have high
hopes for this palette because
cheechee have never let me down pretties
is like an everyday blush shade yes I'm
going to go in with the shimmery one
over the top for a bit more of a glory
oh yeah that's stunning and see it was
Lantry selecting you wouldn't even need
like highlight if you weren't like crazy
like me but of course if you are crazy
like me go ahead and take a highlight
this one is the Smashbox
hi
I think this is the one that's in
collaboration with Casey home so I'm
going to take the end sheet right here
this is a really pretty pinky champagne
color and I'm just going to put a little
bit a lot on my cheeks
that's pretty I'm going to put on the
tip my nose all my others look like
little tiny sparkles in there some
people don't really like sparkly
products but if you do you may like this
let's move on to the lips I'm pretty
sure I have using morphe liquid lipstick
before but only once that was a new
color I can't remember what I thought of
it so I really wanted to try a red out
so I'm just going to start feeling my
lips in I do remember they smell like
exactly like Kylie's very like cupcake
II only though this is so pigmented oh
and happy fetus has like kind of a messy
consistency all right so this is what it
looks like it looks really nice it feels
so comfortable on the lips I'm just
seeing if there's like any patches and
yeah looks pretty good to me and this
color is amazing what silk color it is
multi what oh my god it's actually
called multi oh my gosh look how cute
these earrings are they're massive
they're from Collette they literally
like sick cells or something like living
so let's have a little review of the
makeup it is definitely like out of my
comfort zone this is so intense
and so dramatic Rose on the eyes and on
the lips but I think it looks kind of
cool but like I wouldn't really like
lean towards this a lot you know so I
really like the morphe at liquid
lipstick everything on my face
does look really nice although I want to
get a lot of foundation maybe when I
have a tan on it will match better
because my Chan is fading a lot so it
could work out although it does look
pretty good with all of the bronzer down
my neck it is very lightweight like it
doesn't really feel like I have
foundation on at all I love the BH
Cosmetics bronzer it has like a little
shimmers in there just makes the skin
look so sunkissed for a lot of people
that's probably like way too much bronze
leather like I wasn't a massive fan of
the essence concealer
at the end of the day this is probably
like five dollars essence stuff is
always super cheap the eye base was
pretty good but it made my eyes look
like wrinkly but I'm thinking that might
have been what I said it with so we
could be safe in that area I'm just
going to add this one on because I want
to be like more intense oh my god are we
actually going there or what see I think
that's pretty much all I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do that
please give it a big thumbs up a big
thumbs up oh my God my hands hotel I
think tums up for turning the make up
look around from
disasterous through actually kind of
wearable order I don't really know if I
suit black smokers just with my features
are so dark I feel like black doesn't
really work with my eyebrows in my eye
color but what else I love you guys so
much don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I'll see you in my next
video hmmm
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
