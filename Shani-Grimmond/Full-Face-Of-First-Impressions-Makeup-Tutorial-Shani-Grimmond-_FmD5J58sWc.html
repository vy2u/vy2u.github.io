back to my channel
so in today's video I'm doing a first
impression on a bunch of new makeup that
I've picked up over the last month or so
not everything that I use in the video
is brand new just because I don't have a
new thing of every step if you know I'm
saying but a lot of things are new so
yeah I have so much fun just playing
around different products and seeing how
they worked out to my skin oh yeah this
is the first time filming in my brand
new room it looks very similar to my old
setup because it's a same furniture and
the same white wall but I am planning on
getting a new background very soon so
yes I hope you guys like this video and
let's go here get started so I'm going
to start off with the brows and eyes
just so I don't have any fallout on my
face and then I'll do the fender from
later so for my brows I'm using the oh
hey brow brow shaping kit by Australia's
I'm quite excited so I'm going to start
by using the wax so I'm just going to
start by filling them in at the tail of
my brow and this wax is really dark so
it kind of looks like the Australia's
pomade and just like reshapes them I
really like it
so wax usually just keeps the hairs in
place and it's also really easy to like
change the shape of your brow it's
working quite well oh my god I have a
really long IRA hair that's been at my
grill goodbye friend
how
okay so I really love the way that that
formula looks on my brows I'm very
impressed now I'm going to be taking a
mixture of these two shades and just go
over the whole brow just to set that wax
in place
and now taking my Sigma warm neutrals
palette I'm going to be taking the shade
cinnamon which is that this one right
here and I love this as a transition
shade so I'm going to be using this and
just popping it throughout my crease so
I just looked down and then take it in
windshield wiper motions so from outer
corner to inner corner and now taking up
my sleek I divine palette and this is
the sunset one I'm going to be taking at
this color right here it's just a really
nice burgundy color it is super
pigmented by the feel of it and I'm just
going to pop this all over my lid with
my finger I wouldn't say it's as
pigmented as my other eyeshadows but it
is buildable so just keep packing on
there to get the nice to get the color
that you want and now taking my full
exposure Smashbox palette I've actually
never used this but it looks like I have
because it's so dirty I'm going to be
taking this dark brown shade right here
on this zoeva soft definer brush and I'm
just going to pop this through my crease
to add some definition okay I'm not
really a huge fan of this I show either
it's so flop and hard to blend compared
to my Sigma one
okay so instead I'm going to take that
warm shade again that I put in the
crease hopefully to blend this puppy dog
out
okay then I'm just going to blend it
with a bigger brush I don't even know
what's going on right now these colors
are so ugly
and now taking this light pink color
right here I'm just going to pop this
right in the middle of my lid
okay so what I do now to clean up that
line right there is take a bit of my
micellar cleansing water on a little
cotton tip and I just put a little bit
of product on data and then I just run
the cotton tip from the corner of my eye
up to the edge of my eyebrow dress so
it's like a really nice clean line okay
so now that I look like I've being
punched in the eye
by someone I'm going to move on to
foundation I'm taking my NARS sheer glow
in the shade siroque you see oh god I
have no idea how to pronounce that so
I'm just going to pop a little bit on
the back of my hand
and then I'm going to blend it in with
my Beauty Blender so I got match to this
like color match this one I had a really
dark fake tan on so hopefully it still
matches it looks a little bit yeah it's
working well I really like the coverage
of the skins it kind of looks like a
silky finish like really soft skin
I was so impressed with foundation so
far hopefully we have a new favorite the
color is spot-on to my fake tan you guys
reckon for concealer today I'm taking my
hard candy glamoflauge concealer this is
a very very thick concealer apparently
so it's really going to crease every
where it's separated that's running down
my hand that's not well I'll just give
it a shake and hopefully that fixes it
try again in shall we
what's so funny I don't like it ah okay
that's really disgusting it's still
runny but I'm going to use it anyway
hopefully it doesn't look too bad so I'm
just going to pop a little bit under my
eyes okay Wow a little bit goes a very
very long way so this is extremely light
I'm gonna use it to highlight under my
eyes oh man this is like really light so
now that that is that finally blended
out it literally took ten years I'm
taking my Mac prep and prime in the
shade light boost because this is so
light I need to put a bit more light
around the face so I'm going to put a
little bit on my chin between my brows
down my news let's see how it goes
actually like what that concealer turned
out is very bright under the eyes but I
guess that's a look we're going for
today honey and to set the concealer
under my eyes I'm taking the Australis
AC on to a contouring and highlighting
kit this is something that I use all the
time so this is a new one and I really
like this so I'm just going to Pat that
under there a little bit in between my
brows down my nose and on my chin just
to keep these areas nice and highlighted
and just set the rest of my face I'm
taking the selection Mac pressed powder
in NC 40 this is new I don't really know
how to notice if I like a powder or not
if it makes my face matte and they look
soft then that's enough for me so let's
see about this one
and I always just tap it on because I
don't wanted to stir the foundation yeah
I don't even know about powder I mean it
seems to be doing the job but every
single powder butter use basically does
it the same thing okay so back to the
eyes I'm taking my Sigma warm neutrals
palette again and picking up that warm
color right here and I'm going to pop
this on my lower lash line to kind of
smoke it out a little bit so just really
messily just taking it from side to side
and then taking the sleep palette again
I'm going to be picking up this dark
color that we put all over the lid and
I'm popping that on the outer and inner
corner of my lower lash line and just
keeping it fairly close to the lash line
as well and then taking that lighter
pink and putting it in the middle so
because my eyes are starting to look
very raccoony I'm going to put a white
eyeliner in the waterline to just open
them up a bit and I cannot do this
without looking up time for mascara I'm
taking my eye curve fat brush mascara
big and bold I've seen so many people
talk about this stuff so hopefully it's
good so the mascara is not too bad but
I've had a lot better mascaras it's just
not adding like a lot of volume it's
more like a mascara that you'd wear to
school like very natural-looking
okay so that mascara wasn't really doing
a trick for me I like really big clumpy
lashes so I'm going to be taking the
bomb what's your type mascara and I'm
just going to be popping that all over
that's better
give me some chunky lashes
and now I'm taking a pair of my scooter
lashes and I'm just going to pop these
on I'll be back okay so I just applied
the lashes and I really really lacked in
the very very good quality the only
thing is they were a little bit short so
I put like tons of mascara on them now
I'm loving them so I'm taking the morphe
i shutter and it is in the shade
0-4 and it's just like a really nice
champagne color right there so I'm just
going to use this to highlight right
underneath my eyebrow
holy God bless that's pigmented my bad
and that is crazy harsh that's like a
hooker or something so I'm just going to
go and blend that out a little bit and
just soften it time to give the skin a
bit of color so I'm taking my soleil
Deschanel bronzing stuff on my gosh we
know it is it's just like a grunting
mousse so what I'm going to do is just
pop this under my cheekbones I've use
this like once but I completely forget
how to place oh it's not nice okay so
it's not like really dark so I guess it
would be better on people that have like
a bit more fairest skin than I do
because it's not really making too much
of a difference yeah so I don't think
this is really going to work for me
because it isn't dark enough so what I'm
going to do is take my cooler by its
benefit ah runs off and I'm just going
to put a little bit on same place to
just deepen up that contour a bit and
what we're just going to bring it on my
temples just to kind of warm up the face
a bit going for a strong contour today
okay so now moving on to blush I'm
taking the bomb how about them apples
cheap palate cheek and lip cream color
so they have lots of different colors in
here six different colors I've never
used it so now it's time to see how this
goes I'm going to take the shade caramel
right here and I'm just going to pop
this on my cheeks that's a pretty color
yeah my brush just broken off bless my
soul I really like how this gives like a
really nice Sheen to the face like a
really nice healthy glow I'm very
impressed
and now taking the hourglass ambient
lighting palette I'm going to be picking
out this middle color right here and I'm
just going to pack this on top of my
cheekbones oh my gosh that is actually
really nice girl down the other side I'm
actually really impressed with this I
don't think would be that good and just
a bit on my nose as well and my Cupid's
bow okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you guys a few different
lip options for you to choose from
so if first combo that I'm doing is a
nude so I'm going to take the spice lip
liner by Mac with a bit of Coquette in
the middle like kind of an ombre effect
and then I'm putting a bit of butter
cream in the middle as well
so this is what the nude combo looks
like I would have to say that this is my
favorite one even though I haven't done
any other lip lines yet but nude newly
pink is always my favorite so let's move
on to the next one which is the Too
Faced melted liquid long wear lipstick
in the shade coal this is extremely
pigmented and it smells amazing I'm
actually really impressed with this lip
color I think it's really unique I don't
have anything like this in my collection
it's really moisturizing and pigmented
and it smells beautiful
so for the last look option I'm going in
with my Gerard cosmetics lipstick in the
shade all dolled up this is something I
would never ever ever go for but for you
guys I like hot pinks I thought I would
try it to see you know just in case you
guys liked it so this is the last option
that I have for you guys it is a very
very matte formula so it is kind of
drying on the lips it's not as pigmented
as say like the MAC lipsticks based a
little bit but I do think it is still
very good
so let me know in the comments below
what your favorite a lip color option is
that I showed you guys today so that we
have the finished makeup look I'm
actually obsessed with the way that it
turned out and I had so much fun just
playing around with new products and
seeing what they have up their sleeves
so everything that I use in the video
today was pretty good but there were a
few things like the sleek palette and
the full exposure and the eye chromis
card that didn't really work too well
for me but I would say that they're
still pretty good products and there's
just better out there if you like these
kind of first impressions videos just
give this one a thumbs up so I know to
do more um I freaking love them and also
gonna throw oh yeah if you want me to do
more than I'll be more than happy to get
every single
product and like a new product for every
single step so then it's like all first
impressions if you know what I mean yeah
I hope you guys liked this video and
this makeup look and I'll see you very
soon hi empties is my dessert for the
night and it's good actually kind of
like though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
