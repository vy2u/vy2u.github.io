channel so in today's video I'm doing a
full face of first impressions I have so
much new makeup whereas what peanut was
peeing on the carpet I have so much new
makeup that I want to try out and I have
a look in mind that I want to do so I'm
really excited today's video so let's go
ahead and jump right in I'm going to
start out with the eyebrows and this one
is the Rimmel a brow this way Ralph
sculpting kit and I have a shade medium
brown I just went to calls this morning
and so this I've never seen it before in
my life
so that's what I'm going to use today I
never use the wax maybe I should try it
I'm just going to add a little bit of
wax in my brows to add a bit of texture
the West is pretty much just showing up
like a brow pomade it's working really
well now I'm going to take a little bit
of the powder and really define these
slugs for my god first impression I'm so
impressed with this it's just like serve
your interns so easy to apply it is time
for the eyeshadow so I'm going to take
this new Urban Decay palette right here
I've never seen anything about this or
any one user on social media so I'm very
excited to see how it goes because I
have no expectations at all so the first
shade that I'm going to take is a
levitation and this is going to be my
first transition shade and the brush
that I'm using is the map 2 to 4 this
colors really light time I think I'm
going to be able to see too much at all
not a problem ok this is not showing up
because my skin's like a little too dark
for it so I'm going to take the shade
and not to sail right here this looks
amazing and that's going in the crease
alright let's see if this is pigmented
oh that's really nice it's not overly
pigmented like the hooter Beauty ones
but it is going on really nicely
sometimes it's easier to build a color
up anyway rather than like have so much
go onto your eye at once this color is
really blending out beautifully so I'm
just taking a clean blending brush to
make sure there's no harsh lines right
underneath my brow I'm just going to go
ahead and carve out a cup crease I don't
have any concealer so this is like I
think maybe the only product that isn't
neat but I'm going to take the Tarte
shaped head concealer in the shade like
medium just with F flat shader brush you
can get the real close into my eyelid
once I have at the shape that I want I'm
going to go in and set that down just so
it doesn't crease I'm trying to look up
I'm just going to lightly Pat over the
concealer put a lip color I'm going to
take this palette from at BH Cosmetics
it's called it takes me back to at
Brazil this has so many colorful shades
in here so the color that I'm going to
pick up today is this one right here so
I want to show you guys who I'm inspired
by today with my makeup look I only
follow one makeup page on Instagram and
this is her page this is a look that I
want to do for yellow cut crease kind of
thing
her name is Stephanie Villa 3 s's at the
start i'll leave down below i've spoke
about her in a video before she is so
talented like when would you ever think
to put yellow on your lid never but she
may look good let's see if I can well
first impression I am so incredibly
impressed with how pigmented this color
is oh my god I'm so nervous for this I'm
gonna try my best to do a winged
eyeliner so I'm taking the Schwing black
liquid eyeliner by the balm the winged
liner and the lashes are on let's go
ahead and drop into the face because I
feel like this is where all like the
newer products start so I'm taking the
Dermalogica
skin perfect primer this one has SPF 30
in it I don't really like when they have
SPF in it because that's the real I
don't really go out in the Sun and most
times when I do my makeup I wear black I
wouldn't make up at nighttime so I don't
need SPF in it and then when you have a
flash on you it flashes back so we're
just going to put this family in the
center of my face I feel like it sounds
like a bit of a tint to it oh well I had
like a lot of SPF and I'm kind of scared
oh my god this made my skin look so
beautiful
it feels really light on the skin it
feels moisturized and we also have a
little bit of radiance coming through to
add even more glow I'm gonna go in
the Knicks born this way a liquid
illuminator I'm so excited to try this
I'm just going to put a bit on the back
of my hand
for a peek I'm just going to dab this on
the high points of my face it kind of
has like a little sparkles in it only a
few and the rest is kind of just like a
sheen I am so excited about this
foundation this one is the hourglass
immaculate liquid powder foundation it
is a mattifying and oil-free Unruh if
it's mattifying I guess you're going to
have to go in with this over the top
okay so I have the shade beige I've
never heard anyone talk about it's like
client weight so the brush I'm going to
take is from zoeva it is the one very
for master brush I love this brush I
just wash all of my brushes and it took
so long you or some songs suck in my
nail the by liner I'm just going to go
in and pop this into my skin I really
like the color and we're go in the
coverage is like crazy high
oh my god it's making my face look so
silky what's on this side s we're going
back in with the same concealer that I
used on my eyes um yeah okay this is
boring because you see me is this a
million times
I just think best concealer in the world
you know what time it is time to bowl
and out this concealer with my Beauty
Blender on my brush we have a missing
lash yeah oh my god because the
foundation is so mad I can still look
like I'm not really blending properly or
my gosh I'm so excited to try this
everyone's been talking about it it is
the dermablend loose setting powder so
hopefully this can replace all of my
translucent powders that I've been using
this is the widest translucent powder
ever come across MELAS please don't
leave a white cast dull
muchly nervous but so many people have
used in so it's good so showing off
while this is the baking underneath my
eyes I'm going to take this real stay
matte powder but I got a new shade today
this one's in the shade it's silky beige
so hopefully this doesn't leave like a
little white cast like the transparent
one
did just going to Pat this on my face
very lightly I like how this is like a
very light doesn't feel heavy on the
skin I don't make this face like overly
tight either Pat Foundation went super
flirty right here and here I have no
idea why but hopefully we can fix it but
so far so it's really good I like it
well I think the foundations came out to
my skin it kind of looks cakey now all
right so you learn a white cast oh my
god Nora oh the white classes are going
because the more I blend it my concealer
is going to come off so I guess I can
just like fix it with bronze off for the
lower lash line I'm going to go back in
with that same crease color and this is
just going from outer corner all the way
to inner corner
nothing special under the Ain you just
seem to like even it out no this is like
such a great formula I'm dying
taking the same color that I used for
the yellow I'm going to pick up this
shimmery white color up here and I'm
putting that on my inner corners to give
a little bit of a highlight just to the
pencil brush okay when you put some bit
closer means oh wow now it's really
showing up oh my god I just remembered I
got a new Urban Decay eyeliner so this
one's from the same collection as this
one right here it is so fluorescent love
the color so I'm just going to put this
in my waterline such a crazy color but
Yolo it's not really showing up as much
as I'd like but it is really nice still
looking so talking like if you just like
cracked my face open amazing okay so
let's move on to like the bronzer and
stuff I'm going to take the detection of
no-nos sculpt and glow palette this
one's in the shade 0-1 light/medium so
this one has cream products and then
also a contour highlight and like a
glittery highlight oh my I just realized
all that like glow is gone from the
powder in the ternoon she's not a couple
of okay so I'm going to take this
contour shade at first cut off the
excess and I wanted to be too intense so
and I'm going to cover up my cheekbones
which I like this color
it looks really cool turn in the pan but
it looks really nice in the face like it
doesn't look charity or anything and
then for the bronzer I'm taking the
Bobbi Brown running powder in the shade
at golden light so this is one shade
lighter than what I usually go for but
I'm super excited to see how it looks on
my skin I've always loved the formulas
of these products of the Bobbi Brown how
am I supposed to get rid of that like
weird thing that the foundation did with
my Rimmel stay matte powder I'm gonna
take a little brush and just drag that
underneath my contour and love the shade
of that but we run and then for the
blush I'm taking a slender from Rimmel
in a shade at pink rose I picked this
one up this morning the color looks
absolutely amazing it's like a really
nice shimmery coral pink I love this
color Wow dignity well I mean it looks
pigmented on my brush with hips Clark
comes off I love how does highlight to
my face as well and it's made that um
next product look less ashy it is super
light through so if your skin is darker
than mine I'd probably stay clear from
that shade but they have a chameleon
shades anyway you know what time it is
girl time for highlight off no matter
what highlighter i use i always spritz
it with maxixe but you guys know this so
i'm going back in with a Natasha Turner
palette I'm so excited this step and
taking the highlight cheney please feel
crazy
I always make it way too wet it just
takes off my foundation I don't think
I'm like too crazy about the shade looks
a bit like a she or because I have so
much going on underneath it though I
definitely will give it another chance
when I have my normal base down over the
top I'm going to take this color right
here from the Urban Decay palette same
collection is that all I'm just going to
put this over the top
oh my god this one's like even more
pigmented look at that like holy
let's move on this is the urban decay
24/7 glide-on lip pencil in the shade
1993 I love the urban decay lip range so
much
and then for over top I'm taking the
mellow cosmetics and liquid lip paint in
the shade eye
you say oh my god this color is so
pretty
setting take o- up sorry my bad
it is time for setting spray I'm taking
the locket makeup setting mister Jesus
once and I forget how it goes so let's
try it again if you're wondering why I
destroyed so much fun it's because like
hardly anything comes out it's kind of
nice because um it doesn't like into
like one area just like goes in yon here
we have the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys liked it I'm just
going to give you guys a quick rundown
of what I think of all of the makeups so
the foundation like was amazing it
looked so pretty but I don't really like
the finish of it was true Matt adverse I
was fine but like and it still looks
amazing but it's just like cakey cuz
it's Lorimar obviously it can be my
first time using it so I will give
another try the highlighters look kind
of nice like on camera
but they're a little bit Ashley in real
life love the bronze I love the contour
the blush was so pretty
maybe a little bit too light through lip
color is literally amazing all the
eyeshadows was so good the brow oh my
gosh our palette I love that so much I
guess that's pretty much the main
product I love you guys so much don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up

you in my next video Casali

changed my own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
