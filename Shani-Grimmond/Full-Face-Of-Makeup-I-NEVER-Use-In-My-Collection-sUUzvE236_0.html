channel so in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a makeup look using products that
I literally and never use I have so many
makeup products in my cupboard and
there's like particular products that I
always lean towards so I really need to
just sit down and play with some
products that I know are good or have
potential or some of them aren't but I
just never use them sorry I just want to
share that with you today let's do this
the first work that I have here is the
Mac fluidline brow gel cream and this
one's in the shade at true brunette I
used to use this all the time it's just
a brow pomade but I don't know I still
using brow pomade and switched over to
Pat is but let's see why I left it and
try it out I always use this Merrill yes
sir I'm not using the benefit product
don't worry I'm using this one but the
mare is just like the perfect size so
I'm just going to start at my arch as
per usual oh my god this is so different
to using a powder wow that was sorry
easy to do I honestly forget how easy
pomades are to use purchase glides on so
beautifully oh my god then with
whatever's left I'm just going to hang
in the front of my brows so it's not too
harsh
that is definitely a bold brow and I'm
pretty sure that's why I swept over to
powders but once we clean that up under
here I feel like it's gonna look really
good so something very exciting is
coming up around the corner so Benefit
Cosmetics princess Polly and I have
teamed up to do a really cool
competition I want to read out all the
details here so I don't mess anything up
because I have the worst memory sir um I
made up with me and Michael is gonna be
on the 10th of March in New South Wales
I'll leave all the details down below if
you guys are interested but they're
doing a really cool competition where
you and your best friend can fly and
made us and have like a one-on-one
session with us have a drink we can have
a chat and yeah I'll leave all the
details below if you guys want to enter
that competition the winner gets return
flights and one out accomodation in
Sydney for Friday the 9th of March for
you and your bestie so I feel like
that's actually the coolest thing ever
I'm so excited and I can't wait to meet
some of you guys I feel like a lot of
people are gonna come it's gonna be
crazy
the vibe is gonna be great so yeah let's
go ahead and continue
the makeup now it's time to conceal
underneath the eyebrows sir I'm taking
this Kat Von D look at concealer this
one's in the shade
l-3 warm I never use this I don't know
why I think it's because it's true light
for me but like we can make it look
let's be real I really like the
applicator of this it's really pointy so
it looks like easy to place the product
down but um I feel it lays out under my
armpits
oh that's cup of course I got legs on to
my armpits yesterday and I keep sweating
like really bad I don't know if because
it's the icon that's not working or if
it's something to do with like the laser
treatment like oh well this doesn't
smell right I'm just gonna go ahead and
pry my eyelids and then we can move on
to the air shutter the eyeshadow palette
that I want to use I haven't even
touched it is these a we bought Cafe
palette I mean these are the colors that
we have to work with so I guess I don't
know I might just take this one in the
crease just to like start off the
transition I'm just gonna take that on a
morphe and five a 1/8 brush I'm just
gonna pop this in my crease here this
colors gonna mostly get covered anyway
but I just want something to kind of
draft out my crease area Wow
where's just like lean towards the stuff
that I know work so I always get so
scared to try out new products in case
it fails but I'm impressed
next up I'm gonna take this a beautiful
oh well I just perked it own or I feel
like job this one right here I'm just
gonna take this really nice dock emerald
color emerald green and I'm just gonna
put this in my crease I'm gonna do a cut
crease today sir I'm just gonna blend
this all the way from inner corner to
outer corner well it is very pigmented
thing for more product
I'm just going back in with that
transition shade I'm just going to
soften out the edges for some reason
it's really hard to blend out at the top
here it's looking a little bit choppy
but I'm thinking when I do the cut
crease it's gonna kind of work work with
each other cuz I'm gonna like cut all of
this choppiness here and it's only gonna
be like this little bit up here left so
I'm hoping it'll works out in the end so
let's go ahead and cut the crease girl
so I'm just going to take that Kat Von D
concealer again and take my time and
just cut the whole way across I'm
thinking it might be the concealer as
well that might be stuffing up with the
eyeshadow so I'll have to try it with a
different base next time the next color
that I'm taking is this a beautiful
light green right here just oh my god I
just jabbed that one again this one's in
the shade no added spice so I'm just
gonna pack this all over the lid I did
want to go in with this one roll it here
but I feel like it might blend into this
color up there so let's keep it nice and
large
okay so next I'm gonna go in with this
Dhaka green shade and I think I'm gonna
put that on the ad ah ha so like add a
third of the out of the just cuz I feel
like it'd be cool that green ombre how
to normalcy now it is time for the make
or break I'm gonna go in with the LA go
feline long-lasting fine tip liquid
eyeliner and I'm gonna do a wing that's
good okay so now I'm just gonna go in
with a black eye shudder and I'm just
gonna smoke out that wing liner because
it looks a bit dodgy and I feel like
smoke you know it's gonna make it look
better the next step is to go in and add
some false lashes or they use have been
sitting in my cupboard so so long and
I've never touched them they're from
here to beauty I haven't used eyelash
laughs I haven't used eyelashes in quite
a while
these ones are in a style hominy
seventeen and they split up into like
full separate sections so they're easier
to apply I knew we forgot to put the
scar on what the dog oh right
for mascara I'm taking the potty proof
essence instant volume boost ready in
ten seconds it reckons your worries okay
I'm just gonna Curt my lashes oh I
really like this mascara especially for
an affordable one beautiful okay I'm
getting ahead of myself
there's actually another thing that I
want to do as well it is a place and
glitter liner on the cut crease this is
the Too Faced glitter pulk peel off
eyeliner in the shade lucky bitch Wow
Foca just kidding I love that
I'm just gonna leave it like that and
kind of let it fade off at the edges
there well this stuff is honestly the
best glitter eyeliner in the world
anyways back to business let's pop on
the lashes that's actually so easy to
apply you know what though these aren't
gonna be big enough I'm gonna put the
inner corner on the outer corner so I'm
just gonna layer up the lashes they look
really good in super like not sure they
kind of look like eyelash extensions
it's cool my eyes are finally done let's
move on to the skin so because I just
got a facial I'm gonna use a primer
that's gonna protect my skin from
anything we put over the top so I'm
gonna take the Dermalogica skin perfect
primer this one has SPF 30 in it as well
I'm just gonna put this on the back of
my hand and blend it out all over my
face with the petal brush noesis sorry
side putting putting like product on my
face after a facial my skin was so fresh
it doesn't end yeah for the foundation
today I'm going to take the Revlon new
complexion oil control makeup this is in
the shade oh do anything it says oh it
says on the front early tan I actually
think I've run these is foundation once
oh let's see how this goes on in the
face cuz I completely forget well I
really like the color
the coverage isn't overly high but I do
like how it's looking on the skin let's
see how it covers all these uglies see
when I used to use all of my foundations
that I don't really use anymore I didn't
have bad skin like I didn't have
breakouts and stuff I had to rephrase
that because I know if I say I've got
bad skin someone's gonna come at me if
they have more people than I do well
when I did use this I had like no
pimples at all so I didn't know I mean I
thought it was good but like now I can
say doesn't have good coverage but I do
like it for what I don't have big pink
dads I feel like everyone's cheering
right now because of the color match now
going back in with the cap one day
concealer I'm a little bit worried this
is gonna be true light so under my eyes
but let's oh just say she reckons I mean
I guess we can have a highlighted effect
today okay so once this blended it looks
pretty good I love the consistency I
need to get a darker shade though oh my
god I completely forgot I have this it
is the Patrick Starr translucent powder
I do have a new one that I wanted to use
in this video but I think I'm just gonna
say this for a first impressions because
I'm really scared it's gonna stuff
everything up so this is the one that I
kind of use the least because I totally
forgot about it so I'm just gonna get
rid of all the wrinkles well all the
creases under here it's very nice to
ourselves charms and then I'm just gonna
go in Bakke oh my god this literally
melts into the skin like I don't know
why don't use this every single day you
don't even need to blend it away oh my
gosh I haven't used this in ages no
wonder why it's orange why did I get
that color oh my god I forgot about this
one it is the Australian flawless
pressed powder this one's in the shade
medium tan Oh
- looks like my shade oh my gosh my
foundation was looking really weird
underneath that sitting paddle you know
what it would be the concealer because
I've used that concealer I meant I've
used that powder with different
concealers and it works really well
but now it looks re cakey and it's
detaching itself from the concealer
I'm gonna go ahead and set the brows if
you guys have been watching me for a
while then you would know that I've been
literally using this for like three or
four years on my channel well that means
it's like four years old no surely not I
don't know okay this is the Australis
keep my brow brow in and I have the
shade light brown I'm just gonna use
this to brush my eyebrows
hi I'm hold upwards to make them look a
bit more full oh my god it's very wet
there's a lot of product in there I'm
pretty sure I bought a new ones you're
like relax it's not four years old maybe
three next up I'm gonna do my lower lash
line so I'm just gonna take this emerald
green again and just take that from
outer corner to inner corner nothing too
special here oh my goodness that is so
cakey that concealer all the powder
something's gone so wrong under there I
just went ahead and put some different
colored eyes in that is I'm so stupid I
just read in some contacts because I
feel like I want to change it up a
little bit so let's move on to the
bronzer I haven't used this one in the
longest time it is the benefit hoola
bronzer and I literally just stopped
contouring because my cheekbones are so
freaking dramatic that every time I
contour it just looks muddy so I'm just
gonna very lightly contour and hurt for
the best this brush is really way too
dense for this like relax see that looks
good as long as I'm really gentle with
it
so next I'm going to go in with the
mecha Max Sun lit skin bronzer I don't
know if I've used this one I think I
have but I completely forget if I liked
it or not so let's see how it goes it's
definitely not as like oranges I usually
use when it comes to bronzers but it it
is adding a nice glow that was mrs.
Turner this brush is so good for bronze
I was like all I've been using it's the
morphe M five-30 brush instead I'm gonna
take the BH Cosmetics satin bronze out
in the shade tech clip a tranquil tan
and I'm just gonna put this over the top
just for a bit more of a glow an orange
glow why not and I'm also just gonna
take this around my forehead as well
we're on my chin jewel barn and also
down my neck as well now it is time for
the blush so this one is the classic
color blush from covergirl in the shade
590 the reason I got this is because I
saw krispies using an ages ago and I
think I used it once and never really
used it again but it is a really pretty
shade I'm just gonna put this on the
apples of my cheeks
oh that's really pretty it's very
shimmery oh my god I'm so annoyed I just
picked this up yesterday it's from sleek
it is the highlighting palette precious
metals but it's the cream version there
is one pattern here it's this one right
here and that actually does look like a
really pretty shade so I'm just going to
go into town
at this stage Gorge I'm not sure what
that little twitch was whoa okay that's
very like kind of dry like when I put it
on it kinda just like stuck down to the
skin very quickly all right I like the
color of it I don't know if I like the
formula I'm gonna go in with this
benefit highlight off just because I
haven't use this one in ages and I feel
like it's some kind of stuffing the gold
turned down a little bit cuz it's like a
light pink shade this one's a very
subtle door oh wow maybe not I was gonna
use the Kylie cosmetics liquid lipstick
but I just kind of look at it and it's
kind of like going a weird like the
shade is going like brown on one side I
guess the pigments just like separated
so I guess all you'd have to do it shake
it just scraped around the edges and
like that happened like the brown went
like pink I don't know what else so
instead I'm gonna take the NYX
retractable lip liner this one's in the
shade natural I used to use this all the
time I love it it's very affordable so
I'm just going to line my lips it's
definitely not as good as my Joey or
urban decay lip liners that's really why
I stopped using it but it is still
really good for an affordable product so
next I'm gonna go in with the Marc
Jacobs what even is this called it's the
high shine lip goal hi shiny lip gloss
in the shade 3 for 4 skin deep it's like
the perfect nerd I haven't used this in
a while and I just use all the time
what's like the perfect nude shade and I
haven't done glossy lips in a while oh
oh my god that makes so much sense why
it's minty though because it's on your
mouth they want your mouth to smell
fresh I just don't like me at first
but if you do I'm gonna go in with the
rim all insta-fix and go this is a
primer and setting spray I haven't used
this in a while and I actually really
like it
it smells like cucumbers as well which
is amazing it's so fresh okay guys so
here we have the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I had so
much fun creating this I actually really
liked how it turned out I think my
favorite thing is like the gold glitter
in the cut crease I think it looks so
good and I'm obsessed with this lip
color and the lid color so much
everything so don't forget to subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
