channel so in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a makeup tutorial and products
that I'm gonna throw out so this is
gonna be fun I just went through my
cupboard and I always give here my cover
to get rid of perks that I never use
because I feel like there's no point
ordering it in there so I'm just gonna
give it away to people that would use it
more than me this is just perks that
don't work for me and that I'm over or
I'll tell you the reason when I'm using
it but I love them in this video so
let's go ahead and jump in okay so let's
go ahead and start with the eyebrows
this one is from the brand a billion
dollar brows it's called the triple
threat and this is a brow pencil so it
has this bully on one end and then it
has the angled brow pencil on the other
end to be honest I never ever use
pencils and this I think this is been
sitting in my cupboard for like well
over six months and there's like no
point and having it if I never use it I
know someone else will use this but I
want to just give it at least one go cuz
I haven't even come in to chance yet I
guess I'm just gonna start filling in my
arch I just never really felt like brow
pencils got really defined like how I
see look I just and I also feel like
brow pencils are kind of hard to like
reshape the brows if you already have
really nice shaped brows and you just
want to like make them a bit darker and
fill in sparse areas I think they would
work for you but I like to do the whole
shebang hon this really isn't that bad
to be honest but that's because they're
my breasts how do you don't so i'm just
darkening them a little bit next job i'm
gonna go in with this else concealer and
highlighter by me use a concealer end
and i'm gonna use this to prime at my
eyelids i remember i use this a really
long time ago and it really just didn't
do a lot for me like although these
products is super super affordable
you're obviously not going to get the
best like coverage and everything and
some people can't afford like expensive
makeup and that's fine but for me i just
have so many products that work a lot
better than this so i don't feel like
there's a point having it any more I'm
gonna blow it out with my Beauty Blender
I don't know I do certainly feel like it
does a whole lot and I definitely do
still have some affordable
concealers that a great a few guys are
on a budget the Maybelline fit me
concealer is really really good
the next product that I'm planning on
getting rid of is the Kylie Jenner the
burgundy palette and don't get me wrong
this palette is actually a pretty good
it's just like how many palettes look
exactly the same as this like in my
opinion this is like the perfect warm
tone palette you can do quite a few
different looks with this but this one
from Anastasia Beverly Hills the modern
renaissance palette has all of these
shades by just took a chunk out of the
ugly shade that's alright it was an ugly
shade I feel like this palette can do so
much more than this one and it has all
the shades that this one has anyway so
in my opinion anastacio is a little bit
more pigmented a bit more buttery these
are my favorite eye shadows like in the
world and this is my favorite palette in
the world so I just don't feel like it's
really a point having this one I'm gonna
take this orangey shade right here
that's in the shade penny and I'm just
gonna take that in my crease I just feel
like when I look at this palette I'm not
like overly inspired with what I see in
there and with the anastasi one I'm just
I'm just obsessed with it and I can I
like imagine different looks that I can
do in my head but this one just doesn't
work for me next up I'm gonna take this
shade right here and that's gonna go in
my crease to deepen it oh wait orange
and purple I'm gonna take this one
instead that's more of like a brownie
purple and as much burgundy in it so I
think that'll be a little bit better
just gonna pop this in my crease okay so
now that I've blended that in another
fan of the colors together I'm just
gonna go in with this gold and I'm gonna
pack this all over my lid with my finger
see that's very pigmented a like that
shade I'll go ahead and finish the eyes
off later I really feel like we need
some big lashes because I wrote the I
should hop really high but it'll look
fine sir well to an extent so let's go
in with foundation at this one is the
Fenty Beauty foundation and I have this
shade 300 and the reason why I want to
get rid of this one is because this
honestly oxidizes so bad and it
literally makes my face look orange
which is sad because I feel like it is a
pretty good foundation if I go to a lot
of shade it would be fun I just really
don't like how it oxidizes I just got
the wrong shade to begin with it's
totally my fault I'll use it once sir
please tell me I'm trying my absolute
best to get this foundation off I just
took the lid off the pump thing I think
it's gonna wear ok so this foundation
dries very very quickly so we got to
work fast got this much and let's go in
see first of all it's way too yellowy
orange for me but then it goes even more
orient it actually does make the face
look beautiful though I just have so
many foundations and I'm like worried
about spending money in getting the
wrong shade look at that okay sorry boo
concealer I'm gonna go back in with that
elf concealer and I'm just gonna pop
this underneath my eyes so watery oh my
god I really need something light under
here because this hand Asian is so off
right now I'm gonna go ahead and blend
this in it did a really nice job of
brightening under the eyes and it
definitely feels nice and hydrating I'm
gonna put this here as well to lighten
it up I might keep this just because it
is so affordable and I could use this to
like a really minimal makeup it looks
but when I'm filming because it doesn't
look horrible you know I just don't I
know I'm not gonna use it in my own time
but at least I can share it with you
guys if you ever need an affordable
concealer that looks very natural
sorry ugly okay so next I'm gonna go in
with the original awesome a powder and
oh okay I'm definitely oh my god I'm
definitely gonna get rid of this one
because this leaves the worst white cast
under my eyes and take self foundation I
just really don't like it if you have
very pale skin this will probably look
really good on you
it looks really gonna Michael but on me
because I'm tan um it really shows up
like the white costume really shows off
so I'm gonna put this on my life lines
as well cuz I get really bad creasing
they're just crazy how sometimes
products work for you and sometimes they
don't I swear to god I used a foundation
the other day that was more of like a
wet finish see this one here is more of
a dry finish it dries pretty much matte
so the awesome a powder didn't stick to
it as much as the other foundation so it
didn't even leave a white cast at all so
now I know when I'm going to use this
one I only use it with a foundation that
drives matte on its own don't you don't
use this to set like a jus ikan sealer
or like a thick concealer or a really
jewelry foundation because that's when
it's gonna leave a really bad white cost
so I'm glad I know that now this video
is a game changer for me I'm
loving it let's go ahead and finish the
lower lash line so I'm gonna go in with
that dark brown shade and I'm just gonna
pop this from outer corner to inner
corner so we can even that little puppy
out this next one is the Tarte a lifted
at mascara this one's a brown mascara
and I just don't feel like it adds a lot
of volume when I apply this I don't know
not the massive fan of it so I think I'm
gonna get rid of this one made him a
little bit longer this would be great if
you want like a really natural look okay
so let's move on through the eyelashes
these are the ones that I picked out of
my cupboard that I wanted to get rid of
just because this style of them is
definitely not what I like I feel like
that too there we go I feel like that
too black at the root they're just gonna
look super fake I like really long
fluffy wispy looking lashes so I'm gonna
go ahead and apply these babies all
right let's do this
oh my god cute this is literally the
same size in my lashes just a little bit
more volume eyes by the way this is the
brand slay all day I'm pretty sure they
have lashes that I was like obsessed
with I think this ban is just way too
thick because it's
really bending properly usually they're
fine
let's just be this style anyways let's
move on to the cheeks so I'm gonna take
this a Bobbi Brown bronzing powder in
lights sorry
golden light one and to me I feel like
this is just a little bit too cool tone
I haven't used in a while so let's see
how it looks on my cheekbones those
aren't even bad what do you mean see
this can be a little tip for you guys if
you ever feel like you want to throw any
products out give it one last chance
because not everything is as bad as it
seems and don't judge a book by it's
cover because that's actually great next
up we have the Too Faced dark chocolate
Soleil the only reason I'm getting rid
of this is because my skin turn isn't
dark enough but I do have the milk
chocolate one that I really like oh yeah
this is nice to add a little bit of
warmth if you have a really light hand
it'll definitely work but I just do have
like a lot of other wool the brush hair
is coming off why do I always do weird
facial expressions I just have other
bronzes that I can kind of go crazy with
and it won't look orange and too dark on
me you know what I mean Oh see look at
this this is coming together nicely I
mean wouldn't wear this makeup clubbing
but let's go in with the awesome a
powder and bake a little bit so we have
a nice contour line like we are you
serious literally just not all over the
floor like I'm not even kidding half of
the tub just left the building
bye have a nice life down there because
I'm not vacuuming up that the vacuuming
you up alright I'm just going to brush
this off
well she's a bit dramatic
that side looks really good just tend to
blend that in a bit
okay this one is the zoeva blush in the
shade gentle touch this one is way too
light and pink for me in my opinion
these formulas are amazing though what's
is one color that was like so beautiful
lolita or something I love it but this
color is just not like a cup of tea or
just gonna put some on the apples of my
cheeks if you have very pale skin though
that would probably work for you next up
is highlight time so this one is the
Physicians Formula pad appellate in
trends loosen pearl I used to love love
love love this product so much and then
the first layer came off and it wasn't
as intense as it used to be so the first
thing I had like a lot of shimmer on it
it looked so beautiful on this skin it
was a nice glory but now I just feel
like it's needs help it just in my
opinion like it's still pretty but it
looks a little bit ashy because it's so
like white and like powdery it doesn't
really have shimmers in it it's just I
think it's meant to just be like
obviously a glow I know it's definitely
not the worst but like my face is
looking a hot mess right now
next up we have these products from
fenty beauty and that's just not my
color
so I'm just gonna give to someone that
would wear this so let's see what it
looks like this is very frosty and I
feel like 4c lips look like kids makeup
it's quite pigmented they're not gonna
lie oh my god
but it's seriously something okay last
but not least this one is really
expensive I'm super sad about this but
it's from Marc Jacobs it is the
perfecting coconut setting mist last
time I use this it literally left white
dots all over my face let's see if it
does it again because my friend
literally just squirted in like massive
balls after a few pumps and this spritz
are actually oh my god okay I want to
show you what it does can you see that
wait I don't know if you can see it it's
like one light but if you press really
hard it actually goes out really nicely
I just pray that will live in my lap so
if you do have this just press really
hard so anyways here we have the finish
to make it look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did give it a
massive thumbs up so what do I think
about all of these products little
rundown
nothing was horrible honestly you can
tell if you just do that it doesn't look
horrible kind of does doesn't it yeah as
I said at this side of the video this is
not products that I hate it's literally
just products that either didn't work
for my skin tone which usually is my
fault I'm not blaming any of these
brands these brands honestly all
incredible every brand has products that
I love and every brand has produce I
don't love sorry I hurt you learn
something from this video I love you
guys so much and I'll see you in my next
year no I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
