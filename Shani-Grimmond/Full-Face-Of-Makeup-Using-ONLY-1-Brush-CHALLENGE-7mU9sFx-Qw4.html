so in today's video I'm doing a full
face of makeup using only one brush oh
the Russian I chose today is this one
right here it's quite quite small so I
feel like we can do the eye shadow still
but I can still left to the face and
it's going to look okay well I'm hoping
it's clear look okay so I guess let's
just jump straight into it don't forget
to subscribe it to my channel if you
haven't already I love you guys let's do
this I'm just like shaking my head and
disappointment like why am i doing this
so many of you guys have recommended me
to do this so this is for you I guess
we're going to start with the eyeshadow
today so then if I bring the eyeshadow
down too far at least then I can clean
it up on the edges right here so I'm
taking a concealer I'm just going to
take a really light concealer and I
guess just painting on my brush because
this is technically a brush god I can
actually think about how hard this is
going to be then we go I honestly like
don't think I'll do my brows like I
think that is also mixed for today
because like how is that possible I
guess I'll just like try and carve like
a line underneath my brows so they look
a little bit neater it's like the best
we're going to do okay amazing so now
I'm going to go in with some powder and
just set that I base down I do have a
brush cleaner right here so I can kind
of like clean my brush in between uses
because after I do my eyeshadow we're
going to move on to the face and that's
not going to be pretty if I don't clean
my brush now it's time for the eyeshadow
so I'm going to take this a really
pigmented palette maybe that'll make it
easier
this one's from dos because it's so
pretty I don't even know if I've used it
on my channel before I think I have so
the first curl that I'm going to take is
this color right here and I guess we can
try and make this the transition color
so I'm just going to dab it in on my
board that it let out eyes I think like
that and I'm just going to like with
this like all over my lid and keep it as
low as I can always
not a problem community easier doing it
I shudder with your fingers what zero
she's clean okay so we'd like the edge
of the brush with the edge of the brush
I'm just going to like twitch really
just happen they don't have just
happened if that sagging thing was
hanging down for the past ten minutes
not going to be happy anyways taking the
corner of this brush I'm just going to
blend out the edges as much as I can
god I think I look feeling about this
okay it's like you're not learning I
feel like most of it has like low key
like just fade it away but the next
color I'm going to take is this one
right here and I'm going to try my best
to keep it as low as possible just using
the edge of the brush I mean I said that
last time and I wear not so high so I'm
kinda nervous we've got this honey I'm
just going to take that original color
and kind of like lightly blend around
the edges
communit so here as bad as I saw I think
this is the best going to be able to get
it otherwise it's just going to go up
too high next step is to take I mean
this is toilet paper which like makeup
River white but you can use makeup
remover what if you prefer I'm going to
clean up the edges this is going to save
up my life now is time for the face so
let's move on to primer this one's going
to be so easy and you're kidding me I
have this one in the bag a bit longer
than normal you can never forget primer
even if you're doing a challenge video
am I arrived
it is Foundation time so I'm taking my
white male foundation of absolutely
obsessed with this one but a little
spatula oh okay alright use a spatula
wait no I'm not going to do that I'm
going to work in that little areas over
time oh did you put as much as me and
it's going to blend out easily
here's a size comparison of the brush
that I normal here and this one see you
guys in 20 years literally I feel like
I'm kind of taking this challenge to the
next level because obvious
you can use like say a spatula like with
the foundation or you can use your
fingers because technically the only
rule is one brush doesn't mean no
fingers but I just sort of be fun to
like literally just use one brush
instead of anything else
I love how yellow might look all the
time it's like my favorite thing in the
world okay so I'm just going to put a
bit of my concealer on the back
toothbrush do my fangirl click back
you're sure right now anymore the
concealer under there
if I get a story long to blend out no
wonder why I use Beauty blenders every
day of my life
well what I'll do right now to blend out
my foundation with a beauty minor okay
I'm oh lucky so impressed right now so
let's me want to setting this space down
before it creases away I'm taking a
translucent powder and I'm just going to
pop this right on underneath my eyes
where you believe under this step it
feels so wrong I guess I'm just going to
Pat it if there's like splicing in case
it's like going anywhere
and you know what's next and that is
setting at my whole face with powder oh
my god this is going to take a million
years I'm not even kidding I'm just
going to set the areas where I would put
products over the top stove weak
cheekbones and laughs lines and middle
because they're just crease instantly I
think I'm going to finish off my eyes
first just so it doesn't look like I've
been punched in the face so I'm going to
take well I guess I want to take the
dark brown just put it on my lower lash
line just with a corner again
I'm so concerned about this day
otherwise that was stressful that looks
amazing technically a mascara wand is a
brush right so I'm just going to go in
with some falsies instead so I'll be
right back to the lashes are on side
feel like it's looking a bit better
although it does look really weird with
no mascara especially on my lower lashes
because they're like white from the
powder that I put on result but let's
move on to the bronzer I'm going to take
this massive one from life jackets I
love this one I feel like this is going
to be so weird I weird applying it with
such a small brush it's gonna be really
hard I think
I guess as long as I cute like a really
life and it'll be fine
oh yeah that's not bad that's my honey
don't go crazy like you always do with
the plum sauce okay this is just like
rubbing my foundation off because the
brush is so dense that were just about
to blow on that part okay so getting
onto the flash this one is so pigmented
so I'm just going to tap off as much as
I hand oh my gosh okay not up like a
couple I know that is a problem
oh my god no it's not burning out so
didn't set my face properly as where
this was only what itís exactly really
oh so classic and then for my
highlighter I'm using one of my favorite
this one's from a Mac it's in the shade
beaming blush and when I was traveling
it like disconnected itself from the pan
so I'm really scared in a fully I need
to be so careful all right this is gonna
be fun she's oh yeah can you not he's
gonna lick it
there we go so you out there okay so
liquid lipstick I'm taking this one from
her beauty it's a dark and you can still
like see where a off but like it's
not going to be like a red because stuff
that alright so just let me enter the
brush again this is going to be the
hardest part I know it
oh my god it's actually not that hard
mmm-hmm honestly this whole nerd eye
browsing is just not working for me I'm
going to take a little bit of brow
powder and just turned dark them up a
tiny bit because that's sort of ashy for
God it's getting everywhere SOS help
this is probably a bad idea isn't I
remember the whole thing even though I'm
obviously not going to wear this makeup
out I may as well set it so it's go in
perfect would cost like my 13 year old
cheap vodka days okay guys I think we
officially have the finished look I
really hope you enjoyed it
I mean it's not as bad as what I thought
I could probably get away with wearing
this in public I mean it kind of just
looks like an eight year old that did my
makeup like my little sister or
something but it's not the end of the
world I don't hate it so I really hope
you guys enjoyed today's video if you
did please give it a massive a thumbs up
because that helps me out so so much I
love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
