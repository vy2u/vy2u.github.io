today's video I'm doing a makeup
tutorial on this look right here it is a
very colorful and fun I love it so much
so to make it even better I pulled out
all of the makeup that I never used
because I'm like new switch it up a bit
using different products so I have some
new products and also some old ones I
just have not touched in the longest
time so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already give
this video a thumbs up then okay let's
get into the video so I'm just going to
start with this garber and Kelly brow
powder so I'm just going to use the
darkest shade and I just found this in
the back of my makeup cupboard and I was
like never used this before let's give
it a try and I absolutely loved it it is
so buttery and pigmented so easy to
apply so very impressed with that one
and then I'm going in with the new knob
concealer this is the medium one custard
shade it is a soft matte concealer so
it's super thick so I just used this to
carve out my brows and oh my god
completely obsessive as well I was
finding so many new products that I love
in today's video which is always a
winner so I'm going to use that same
product to prime my eyelids to make sure
there's no veins visible and then I'm
just going to take this matte white
shade to set my lid just so the
eyeshadows blend out easily on top so
it's not tacky and then that would the
same cap on the eyeshadow palette I'm
going to pick up this beautiful greeny
blue color and I'm going to use this in
the crease this is the prettiest shade
ever it's so unique I've never used
anything like this before so just a
little brush I'm going to blend that
from outer corner to inner corner and
also don't forget to go in with a clean
brush just to blend out the edges so you
don't bring the color up too high
so next I'm just going to make a cut
crease with that same at NARS concealer
so we can add some more color on that
lid honey
again just taking that matte light shade
I'm just going to pack this all over my
lid so the color that we put on over the
top of this one doesn't speak to that
concealer so I'm going to take this
beautiful shimmery purple and this one
is going on the inner half of the cut
crease all of these shades are so
pigmented but I'm pretty sure this
palette is a limited edition but
obviously you can use any colorful
shadows that you have so the next shade
I'm going to take is this beautiful hot
pink shade and this one's going on the
outer half just on a little flat shader
brush I'm just going to pack that down
and then I'm going to take a little bit
of the purple and say the pink and
purple together so it's like a nice
gradient it looks so pretty okay so now
I'm going to take a glitter liner this
one's from Urban Decay I love it so much
as you guys probably know because I use
it in so many videos but I'm just going
to line up where that cut crease is just
because I feel like it needed a little
bit of its sparkle this step is so easy
as long as you just take your time it
will look amazing of course just
cleaning up that eye shadow because I
did bring it out a little fast so I'm
just making sure it looks nice and clean
and crisp then I'm going in with this
Kat Von D and look at hydrating primer
this was the first time using it and I
couldn't like it it is quite expensive
so I guess I'm just going to have to
keep using it to see if it actually
makes the makeup sound longer but it
definitely did boy stur eyes my face
which is a plus so now I'm going to go
in with Foundation and I'm just using
these Smashbox Studios skin this one is
very very light coverage I put on so
many layers to try and build it up and
it wasn't really working but I guess
I'll just keep using it to see how it
goes but it's definitely not my favorite
foundation finish now it's time for
concealer so I'm taking the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer this used to be my
favorite concealer of all times but I
didn't really like it as much as I used
to it wasn't as high coverage as like
the top shape tape which I use all the
time and now I'm obsessed with and I
don't think anything can replace it so
that was a bit disappointing I don't
think I'll be researching I don't think
I'll be repurchasing that one again just
because there is better things on the
market now now it's time to bake under
the eyes so I'm taking the Aussie ma and
Mara color powder and everyone raves
about how good this is but I never use
it because
I don't like it it honestly leaves the
biggest white cast under my eyes and it
just doesn't go like it's horrible I
don't know of course I'll keep using it
to see if there's something I'm doing
wrong and then just set the rest of the
face I'm taking this cover effects
foundation powder I originally got this
to add extra coverage to my face as well
as setting it but when I used it for the
first time it wasn't really giving me
much coverage at all so that's why I
never really used it again but it is
good I just don't feel like it adds much
coverage at all so that's why I like to
use the benefit hello flawless powder
but this definitely is I got
alternatives when I need to like stop
using the same product but as you can
see right here this is what the RTM a
powder does it literally has just left a
massive white pass under my eyes it
never happens to anyone else when I
watch the videos it's so weird now it's
time for the lower lash line so I'm
taking this beautiful bright blue from
that same palette and I'm just going to
tack that on my outer corner I'm not
going to bring it past the middle of my
lower lash line but I'm really going to
bring it down nice and far so we can
have a nice dramatic look and then I'm
going to go back in with that crease
color back nice greeny color and it's
going to blend the two together so it
kind of like fades into one and then I'm
going to take an orange color this is so
food minted I just put this on the inner
corner to the middle and then stated the
two colors together again so it's nice
and seamless this is seriously so
intense what is happening right now and
then for mascara I'm taking me Sephora
outrageous curl this was the first time
using this one as well and I really
liked it it wasn't as wet as I'd hoped
but I absolutely absolutely love the
applicator it really gets into every
single lash and makes them nice and full
so for the false lashes today I'm just
going to take some old one from my
cupboard and this type Pro glue it is
absolutely amazing it dries so quick and
the lashes and that going to go anywhere
I'm just going to take a highlight shade
and highlight the inner corners just to
add some light in that area and then of
course I'm going to set my brows I do
this all the time but I usually do it
off camera so here is what I'm using
today it is the tint morale by Australis
I love this stuff it made my brows a lot
warmer
instead of cool tone I just wanted a
different shade in there today
okay so I like to brush them up in the
front and then brush them down in the
tail to make them less and oh now we can
move on to the bronzer I'm taking this
one from it pixie I'm going to use this
because well I don't know I've never
heard of the brand so I was like I'm
scared if this is bad and it's going to
ruin a whole makeup tutorial but I
risked it today and I actually really
liked it very pigmented so if you do use
it make sure you use a light hand but
I'm just going to contour under my
cheekbones and also around my forehead
and my jaw bone so for the bronzer today
I'm using this one from our glasses the
ambient oh my god this one is very
expensive and it's not my favorite just
because it's not like an orange turn
like I usually use I like that sunkissed
glow to the face but I am going to just
run my whole face you know how it is
this one's more of like a neutral
bronzer I don't know it's just not
orange I love the orange dinky then for
the blush I'm taking this one from a
Charlotte Tilbury at Charlotte Tilbury
is very very expensive that's why I
never really use it just because there
are so many things out there like NYX
that work pretty much just as well sorry
but this is a really pretty color and
the formula is beautiful it just blends
on so nicely so yeah I guess I'll use it
more but it's just so now for the
highlight I'm gonna use this palette
from a violet boss how pretty are these
shades I'm just going to take the
lighter shade and go on in I forgot how
prettiness was I need to use it more
often it is so intense so I'm just using
the anastacio a23 highlight brush
because it just makes any highlight look
so amazing trust me sir just on top of
my cheekbones and also on my nerves as
well to make it look like a little
button oh and then for the lips I'm
taking this one from Mac and the reason
why I stopped using these ones is
because I felt though really dry but I
think the whole time I just needed to
warm it up in the back of my hands and
then it worked perfectly
I have like a million of these lip
liners so if I didn't like them in the
first place I would have bought so many
so why I need to stop leaving things in
the back of my cupboard so now it's time
the lipstick I'm taking this beautiful
nude shade from a Rimmel it is the
lasting finish it is such a beautiful
nude one of those colors that can go
with any makeup look so to finish off
the look I'm going to take the skin
Naevia make up settings
and we had done so here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys liked it I think it is the coolest
look I've ever done like I'm really
proud of myself the only thing that I'm
like what's happening the glitter line I
how it just like and like all the sudden
here doesn't like fade out into anything
but other than that I'm really happy
with how it looks
the products are roles that I used I
think we're pretty good and I am going
to use a lot more of them a lot
frequently for frequently okay anyway so
I'm going to love you and leave you
don't forget to subscribe to my channel

much and I will see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
