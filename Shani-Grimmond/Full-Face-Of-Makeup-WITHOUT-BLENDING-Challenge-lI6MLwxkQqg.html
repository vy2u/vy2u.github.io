at so in today's video I'm doing a full
face of makeup with no blending I'm
really excited about this one I saw my
friend do it Michael on his YouTube
channel and I'm like I have to do that
it is such a good idea
it's just like a mock around channel
video so yeah you guys like this video
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already and let's go
ahead and do there okay so let's go
ahead and start with the eyebrows so I
feel like this one's going to be kind of
easy because you don't really need to do
too much blending with the brows so
instead of doing little strokes because
I feel like that's like blending the
product together I'm just going to do
like one line on the top one line
underneath as you can see right here I
have a massive chunk of brow like
missing because I got my eyebrows
tattooed and let's just say they need a
refill okay let's do one line at the top
this is going to acquire a lot of
concentration mmm
oh yeah that's amazing now let's do
underneath
I can't blend out that line that's a
really harsh but that's okay okay now
for the front of the brows I'm Senator a
little line at the top with a line at
the bottom stunning that looks pretty
good
another place that I usually blend the
browser's just like to take my story and
like see these lines on the top and
bottom I would usually just like go like
this and kind of make sure it's not too
harsh now well let's go ahead and prime
the eyelid sorry I'm just taking just as
visit I'm just taking a concealer wiping
off any excess product because obviously
we don't want to be able to blend like
with the Beauty Blender to pick up
excess products so I guess I'm just
going to like slap all over my brow and
of course I'm going to do a nice line
underneath my brow to carve out those
stunning slugs just how I wanted to UM
do my makeup today okay so next step is
to go in and set all of that so I guess
I'm just going to get a lot of powder on
my brush and Pat it down because you
can't blend it can we
Oh sustained I've never thought in my
life at least like what happened like
what am i doing please tell me oh
message honks the patter is coming off I
see you I feel like the I shudder is
going to be like the hottest pot so this
is going to be interesting I missed out
with the transition shade I'm just going
to take this one right here just with a
pointing brush em but I guess I'll just
be like owner tapping it down instead of
like unless that you know me that was
pursued Wow I'll just going to look
amazing I can feel it this video is
going to really make me appreciate
blending like honestly I spent so much
time blending my eyeshadow this is just
going to take two seconds I love my
burgundy shade I haven't used this
palette in so long it so many anyway I
should have held it for a makeup big
spot I really want to take that burgundy
shade and just put it above that crease
color so you know what I mean just so it
like dissolves into a nice cranberry
shade oh wow if I like swipe it I feel
like that slender emphasis what now for
the lip shade I'm going to take this
stunning shade right here I love it so
much it's like a greeny purple duochrome
and if you do another tutorial with it
I've done like true already so I'm just
going to Pat this on my lid by pressing
down oh my god it's not sticking my very
much concealer on there
look can't forget the primer so I'm
going in with the Smashbox photo-finish
playing what I know need to blend this
honey just go straight on hmm okay maybe
that is cheating so I'm going to go
ahead with the Laura Mercier foundation
primer I don't know how to apply this I
guess I'll just take a little bit on the
stippling brush and just like do that
without going over it twice
without extra glow on the face I'm
taking this Mac strobe cream it's a new
one and I really want to try it out Oh
comes with a spatula so I'm just going
to like paint this on my cheekbones
because I wear a nice glow you know
other means so as you can see we're
already killing the game look what was
done waiting good job guys okay let's
move on to foundation so I'm going to
take this some makeup private foundation
because it was sitting right in front of
me okay so I'm just going to apply it
with a little power brush and I'm just
going to do small strokes all over my
face this is going to blend out all of
the primer and pretty short okay so you
can only go over it once so let's do
this quietly oh this is going to be so
much product by I've literally already
used like six pumps this just feels so
wrong on so many levels like what am i
doing it it concealing it a hurt nobody
I guess that's that
now it's time to go in and set the rest
of the face so I'm just taking my Mac's
like sheer powder and I'm just going to
dot this all over my face and I guess
this is just going to absorb any excess
foundation yarks my face is so wet oh my
god my powder is literally like a
foundation powder now what okay I'm also
going to like a lot blend but like dab
under my eyes pick up anything that we
have gone on there my face is just as
wet as it was two seconds ago so
obviously there's no way we're going to
be out of set this unless I take some
translucent powder and put it all over
my fatties smart Susan sister okay let's
do not Matt I'm just going to pop some
lashes on even if the makeup look looks
like this I still want to have lashes or
car Oh what even is the lending
Foundation Dominic
so no just taking a nice line from the
outer corner to inner corner is easy I'm
sorry I can't miss the inner corner
highlight so I'm just going to put just
a little dab this and then we're done
with the eyes now that I'm looking
absolutely stunning I'm going to go in
and bronze my face I'm taking be
two-faced dark chocolate Soleil and I'm
just going to run my brush in there holy
it's so powdery oh it's not so good okay
so I'm just going to do a nice stroke
under my cheekbone to warm up my face
okay and I didn't really work I'm just
going to do another one this is
definitely not the right brush to use
for this usually I just like take it in
circular motions and blend it out but no
oh my god I just inhaled that and it
tastes so good
until honey let's move on to blush
this is the Mac machine Mel by this is
the blush it goes with everything I'm
just going to top this on my cheeks for
that I will admit I'm really excited for
the highlight I'm taking jeffree star
ice cold this is something that needs to
be really buffed into the skin so it's
going to look absolutely stunning I'm
just going to really lightly take this
over my cheek so it's not too harsh okay
because it is very light I'm going to do
the tip of my nose as well because I
never forget that step and my keeper
spray all right that was blending I have
a new liquid lipstick from Jeffrey style
that I want to use as well so I'm just
going to apply this normally because
it's not really too much blending with
liquid lipstick it will be smells like
dirty feet okay so here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys liked it and learn so many tips
today yeah I just decided to just for a
bit of fun it's nothing serious
alright if you like these a weird kind
of videos make sure to give this one a
big thumbs up I'm going to wash yourself
now because it feels disgusting it looks
like someone actually just on my
face
 makeup on my face and your prints
done I love you guys so much and I will
see you in my next video that of
I my love is good following my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
