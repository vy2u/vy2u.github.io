channel so in today's video I'm doing a
full face of first impressions I have a
bunch of a really cool new products we
have the new Too Faced glitter bomb
palette I'm so excited about this
because I've heard mixed reviews on a
fallacy helper to me Oh dr. growling
what a convenient time and then we have
a bunch of other massive brands that I'm
super excited to put to the test so if
you haven't subscribed to my channel
already make sure you do that down below
and let's go ahead and jump right into
the video
I'm going to start out with my eyebrows
so I'm taking this too for our crayon
retractable brow pencil and this is
waterproof and it's in the shade a rich
chestnut so I never usually use that
brow pencils I'm super nervous and
eventually I can't just I can't get my
brows look really nice with a pencil I
can only get them to look really sharp
with like a pony or a powder so this is
going to be interesting I guess I'm just
going to start drawing like little
strokes I mean seems to be working
really well like super pigmented it's
not too soft so it's like easy to apply
so for me I find it so hard to like
reshape underneath my brows I need to
pull the bottom of my brow life down a
bit to make it a little bit thicker but
it's so hard and it's also hard to make
the edge of my brow really sharp so I'm
going to have to fill in just like the
top part of my brow and then go on with
a powder because it just like isn't
logical for me like then know you name
your name I mean if you do like brow
pencils I really like to form a lot of
this one but to make your brows like a
different shape it's literally
impossible okay so obviously I'm going
to take a color out of here for the lid
color but there's only a matte black and
a matte light so we can't use anything
from there for the transition so I'm
going to go in with the chichi max-q
palette I've never used this one I have
use like these palettes before but just
not this color selection so what I'm
going to do is pick up this Bobbie
purple and color right here and this is
going to be my transition shade what's
one is in the crease I'm taking this on
my Mac to true for my first impression
is that they're blending
out really nicely I'm just building it
up a little bit because it's not like
overly pigmented but I guess that can be
a good thing sometimes the next call
that I'm taking is this Worr much
chocolate brown down here that looks
like such a gorgeous shade I feel like
that would be really nice if just like
threw it all over the lids and you like
a brown matte smoochy is amazing but I'm
just going to pop this in my crease to
warm it up a little bit
my god this color is amazing next step
is to go in with the true face glitter
glue I'm just going to lay this down all
over my lips before I go in that with
this palette because like when I swatch
this palette it doesn't like it looks
like it needs glitter glue I'll show you
I don't know I kind of just like mine a
little bit more foiled it looks pretty
good but like you okay so I'm just going
to take a flat shader brush and go into
town and the color that I'm taking is
called splashes this really pretty
emerald green on the gliding like
Fuhrman rule which looks like a pigment
is the glitter blue I'm just going to
blend a bit more of that dark brown in
my crease here so it blends in nicely
together
let's move on to the skin so I'm going
to go in with the Kevyn Aucoin at the
essential skin that primer this thing is
seriously so sad so you have to push
down this thing for stuff to come out
the middle okay let's do this oh it
literally just looks like a moisturizer
I'm just going to blend this in with my
little stippling brush that made my face
so soft it feels super light like it
literally doesn't feel like anything's
on but it does feel like a little bit
hydrated sir I am impressed with that
one or do we have to see how it like
holds my makeup the rough day so let's
move on to the foundation I'm going in
with the even-steven or wit foundation
up by the balm I've had to select a
month now it's just been sitting in my
cupboard and I'm so excited to use it so
I have two shades here watching am I
going to be going I'm definitely going
to have to apply this with a kabuki
brush because this is the stickiest
foundation of my life like if I'm
holding like this it's not even moving
at all so this one's a shade a medium
I'm just going to take the lid and get
whatever's in there on
my face and start with desaad oh my god
that blended out so quickly and like so
smoothly because it is whipped I'm
really hoping that it doesn't crease and
like my last lines like over the top I'm
just going to roll it so my lipstick
like comes off more vibrant but the
coverage is really nice like I wouldn't
say it's a full coverage of so it's
definitely like a medium coverage okay
so my face is on I'm just really worried
that it's going to flip around so we'll
see how it goes but next I'm going with
the benefit of boying concealer
industrial-strength concealer in the
shade number one so this is what it
looks like right here and I mean I've
toasted things about this I'm excited
and then I'm going to go straight
underneath my eyes oh wow full coverage
I really like this color as well it's
highlighted under my eye really nicely
but something too intense wow that did a
really good job I had to tell my
brighten is down it was like really
intense okay so everyone ate some
translucent powder because this is
creasing really quickly okay I don't
have a new translucent powder and I
really desperately need one so I'm just
going to go in my Laura Mercier cut away
any lines that we currently have I'm
just going to go I'm literally not even
looking like what's going on I would say
that my foundations does look pretty
cakey I don't think it's ever really
looked as caregiver football so there's
one downside about the foundation itself
is whip those two like what do you
expect I'm just going to set my face
with the hello flawless by benefit let's
go ahead and do under the lash line so
I'm going to take this color right here
are the one that I put in the crease and
I'm just going to dust this from outer
corner all the way to inner corner on a
little just kind of a big blending brush
but I want to kind of like be smoked out
you know it's just looking it up and
here we go and let's look the ugliest
face anyone can ever make mmm okay so
now for the inner corner I'm going back
in with that glitter glue by Too Faced
and I'm just going to pop that right
here
Gorge and then I'm going in with this
pretty gold right here I just want a pop
of gold you know
oh my god it's too dark for the inner
corner okay I'm going to go in with
fairy dust over the top this one right
here have I done
next up is mascara I'm taking the scuba
water resistant a black mascara here
anything because I don't what approve
okay instead I'm going to take the I
curl lash alert wake up and go mascara
see how this goes all the one looks
really good
muralism I'm just going to take this
into the exact motions I mean not bad
it's making my lashes black but it's not
really doing too much at all I'm going
to add the biggest lashes you've ever
seen in your life so I'm taking these
ones by lash floria's and I don't even
know like what style they're in but look
how freakin big dissolved never mind
this is starlet they're in right fit I
say 1 9 I say i9 okay so let's move on
to the face I'm going to go in with the
other decay naked skin shape shift of
pallets I do not even recall getting
this only going to has cream and powder
but I'm Michael borrowed it from my
makeup cupboard and brought it back
males are on you know I hope those this
is really long time so I'm going to take
at this color right here and I'm going
to do a tiny bit of contouring nothing
dramatic but oh my god we need to add so
much color to my face it's cooked my
face is so washed out right now I'm
going to have to swap brushes because it
just is starting to like stick to the
foundation to March I don't know I even
set my face but this is that oh my god
it's not blending I don't like this
foundation it's making everything hard
let's move on to bronzer so I'm going to
go with this that not Stella this is
called the angel pride palette and I'm
taking the shade Laguna and I'm going to
use this to bronze my face a little bit
a little bit sir doctor this may be
where the video occurs can heal that's
alright it's not drinker as a void show
any cleaner you do it all the time for a
little bit of color on the cheeks I'm
taking the shade an angel pride one this
one right here because I feel like this
one's not like too over the top and
because I've got like green and stuff on
my eyes I don't want to like make it
look crazy
I'm just going to lightly toss this on
my cheeks just for a little bit of color
oh that's such a beautiful shade what do
you mean my favorite part of a video is
finally here I'm going in with her load
and I'm taking the hooter beauty 3d HD
palette okay so it says one prep true
set three sculpt and full flush okay one
prep okay that's very subtle okay true
set okay this one that's another level
or something wrong with my skin at the
moment as soon as you put highlighter
down you can like see the texture and
 me up I have a little bumps all
over my skin I just changed my skin care
that's what it would be because nothing
else that it could be it's too white or
okay I'm going to go on the discolor
makes it a bit more yellow I have some
new lipsticks that I want to try but
first I just need to line my lips so we
have left on line the outline going on
so I'm going to take my favorite lip
liner which is from Urban Decay it's
called the 24/7 glide-on a lip pencil in
the shade up side going through a little
hole okay so now for the dose of colors
at lipsticks we have a two shades right
here the one that's laying all over is
called ptosis is a beautiful long nude
and then the other one is called up
butterscotch which I might have to put
in the middle of the lips for a little
bit of an ombre to make my lips look a
bit bigger because I love big juicy lips
so let's do this okay so the first
impression they're very matte but
they're very comfortable they're not
like completely matte I can still see a
shine but like it's not like kind of
like a dry formula it's not a bad
weather
the finishing touch okay so here we have
the finished makeup look okay let's just
have a little rundown of everything
that's happening on the face first thing
that happens when I wear lipstick it's
already on my teeth oh okay so first
thing I would say is the foundation like
it looks nice but it's a little bit
cakey like other I'm not really excited
that I don't think I'm going to use it
again but like it looks alright sorry
the I shot it was really good I really
like how that turns out you definitely
need the glitter glue if you can use
that palette though I'm not going to lie
I really liked the lip color like that
beautiful I just hate getting
things on my TV I'm not on the lashes
honestly beamers that beautiful lashes
I've ever wore my lack I started fluffy
and just like um the highlight it's
really intense
I like it but like my skin condition at
the moment is just not helping the
situation at all the blush is gorgeous I
wouldn't say like the bronzer or like
contoured that you think special I liked
really glowy bronzers but like that
didn't happen for me today did it so
yeah I really hurt you guys I can't
shake it
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a big
thumbs up because that helps me out so
so much I love you guys so much and I'll
see you in my next video
