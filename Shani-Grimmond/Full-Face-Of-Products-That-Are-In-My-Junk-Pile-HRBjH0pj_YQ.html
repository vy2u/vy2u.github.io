channel I feel like I literally look
like an alien right now because I put
green I couldn't take food and I'm
really not used to it
I used to wear eye contacts all the time
to like change up like my makeup looks
kind of like just to what different take
on like what's happening on my face but
I know you guys aren't going to be like
you look
what's going on oh maybe I'll just put
them in at the end so basically what's
happening is in today's video I'm doing
a full face of makeup using products
that I was planning on getting rid of I
never actually saw my makeup out unless
it's gone off but I was playing on
giving this makeup to like my friends or
family so there's a few reasons why I
don't like these products I forget what
some of the reasons are but we can go
through that together and just see how
everything goes and I'm super excited so
let's go ahead and start with the
eyebrows I'm taking this a BH Cosmetics
the ultimate brow palette right here I
do remember the reason why I put this in
my little junk pile and that was because
the packaging is so big and I feel like
this would be perfect if you like a
makeup artist and you need lots of
colors because it obviously helped I'm
molding in here but I only need one
color and is there even a color in here
for me no my perfect shade isn't even
really in here anyway but I just feel
like even if it was like the packaging
is way too bulky to have in like my
personal collection so I was in here rid
of that one look how do I sort of a flat
problem so by the time you guys see this
video I will be over in America so make
sure you hit me up on my Instagram but
you want to see what I'm doing right now
because I know that I'm gonna have the
best time and I know that I'll have a
million photos up my Instagram is just
at SHINee grummond tim is my youtube
name considering that this is an
affordable product it's working like
pretty well but there's definitely a lot
of other brow powders out there that are
a lot better it's a little bit patchy
when I'm applying it up in my art right
here like when I'm trying to reshape my
brow and it's definitely not bad it's
just not very like creamy like my other
like benefit eyebrow powders you know my
eyelids are primed and I was going to
use the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot because
I don't really like that anymore just
because it does dry up pretty quickly
but I actually threw that one out
so I pry my eyes like normal so you guys
can see how the eye shadow actually
works on top as like I would normally
use it so I have a three eyeshadow
palettes here that I put in the bin tail
the first one is the true face of
chocolate bar palette this one is super
old I just feel like the colors in here
are anything special so I was like
thinking and then we have a Smashbox
palette right here and this one has like
really pretty colors in it but you
couldn't create a full look with this
palette so I'm like well that's a waste
of space and I also have these colors in
other palettes as well so the last one
we have is a superhero it cosmetics
eyeshadow palette and again you couldn't
make a full look with this palette so I
just thought what's the point I'm having
I'm having it the formula of the Too
Faced shadows are pretty good it's just
like there's only two matte shades in
the whole palette the white and then the
brown up here so I guess the only color
we can put in the crease is this Brown
so that's what I'm going to do just
taking my map to two full brush as how
usual this is literally the best crease
brush in the world
the only other matte brown color in all
of the three pallets is from a cosmetic
palette and it's called it daring so I'm
just going to take that in my crease
just see how this goes wow that's
pigmented aren't you oh my god this eye
color is actually really nice I'm going
to go in and pack that all over my lid I
haven't really done a dark like smokey
eye in a really long time and I think
with a green icon texador look really
nice now going back in with that lighter
brown color I'm going to use that same
up the lending brush to blend out to
deep edges sorry for doubting you
still I'm just going to wipe away any
excess eyeshadow because we do have a
little bit of Fallout I'm just going to
clean up this line next up is the
foundation so I'm taking the Bobbi Brown
Skin Foundation SPF 15 in the shade all
natural and the reason why I didn't want
this is because the color is like very
yellow so yeah let's just
oh my god it's so runny nor just dropped
my new tights
woah this is literally like water okay
I'm going to blend this in with my
Beauty Blender
it's very light and liquidy if you want
a really light coverage and like a
luminous glow I think this would be good
but when I apply foundation I like to
have at least a medium coverage so
someone will like this for the
concealers I have a two right here that
I was going to get rid of and I haven't
even tried them so the first one here is
the Urban Decay Naked skin a
highlighting fluid I just like I don't
think I would use this it's a shade skin
um choose with this way I literally
thought that you have to put this under
concealer but I'm assuming you just put
it on your cheeks for a glow let's just
see what that looks like
i blend it and oh that's kind of pretty
it's definitely very very subtle but I
think I might keep it on actually
correct so the next one that I have is
the benefit boying brightening concealer
this one's in the shade at number one
and for me this is just a little bit
true like apricot usually I just like to
use like a yellowy concealer because I
feel like that covers everything well
enough to blend all oh my god it's very
high coverage well I guess it's not a
pink one it's on my skin but with this
yellow foundation it's looking a hot
mess let me just tell you that right now
it covers all of the dark circles really
really well my face is seriously a hot
mess right now all of these colors
oh okay so let's move on to cream
contouring I have this palette some
sleek that I don't really want I don't
know I just feel like cream contouring
is such an effort because you put the
cream contour and then you have to set
it with powder and you have to put a
contour powder on the top so it's like
what's the point but I'm going to take
this color right here like bigger
blender and refuses to contour a little
bit that is a really nice color though
I'm not going to lie I'm also going to
take this around my hairline as well
it's to warm up a lot Oh real okay I
actually really liked that one I might
take a little bit of the yellow shade
and just put that down the center of my
nose highlight a tiny bit that works
slightly but not really took my
foundational yeah and then I'm going to
go in with the Garbo and Kelly insta go
powder and cream contour kit I just
really don't like this contour shade the
blush
to drive for me and these are just don't
like creams as it hit the floor so
that's why I was gonna get rid of that
one the banana shade looks freezer door
sir I'm just going to use that to set
underneath my eyes I always bake
underneath my eyes so this is going to
be weird oh my god let's finish off the
eye so I'm going to go in with this
shimmery bronzer color right here and
I'm taking that from outer corner to
inner corner on my lower lash line like
virtually don't mind my face right now
it's you're going to be shocked and
never usually puts shimmery shades in
the lower lash line but honestly we've
only got freaking two matte colors in
the whole palette that little lashline
color wasn't too bad so I'm going to go
ahead and do my lashes and I'll be back
because I don't have any that I want to
get enough which is kind of good thing
now my lashes are sort of let's move on
to the inner corner highlight I really
just want to put a tiny bit of champagne
in there so I'm going to be pitching out
oh oh this color right here just on a
little pencil brush and just very
lightly I'm just going to hold that
right here just for a bit of shimmer
still cause everything else is so much
this is probably the biggest problem
I've ever seen in my life okay so the
next thing we're going to do is the
eyebrows and I've set them I've got this
benefit of gimme brow right here and
this one's in the shade 5 and the only
reason I'm getting rid of this is
because 5 is in my shade like doesn't
mean I hate the product I actually love
the gimme brow so much in a shade at
number 4 so I'm just going to brush my
brows upwards this still works for me
but I just prefer lighter eyebrows so
I'm going to give this to someone don't
know what for oh Jesus to Brunn's the
face I'm taking the Milani it runs
extra-large all over glow and the reason
why I didn't want this is because it
literally hardly shows up at all so
because when I brush in there a million
times and then I'll go in yes you can
see it oh okay well obviously last I
didn't get enough product on my brush oh
god I literally don't even need a
bronzer over the top because that's the
contour at the bronzer I'm mixing
together and it turns out really
athletes that that's going real
overboard here but like what can you do
I was going to use these bareMinerals
invisible bronze colors because they're
so ashy
like well first of all that's not my
shade so that's that's not going to work
but this one is like super ashy so I
just put a tiny bit on over the top just
working the colors very nice I like that
it's shimmery though the next thing that
I have right here is a blush so this is
the gorgeous Cosmetics palette so we
have lots of blush shades and a few
highlighters in here so the reason why I
was going to get rid of this is because
I feel like where do you even get like
good as cosmetics like not many people
can get their hands on it so I'm going
to use this color right here that
actually does look really pretty like a
nice apricot orange color something
apples of my cheeks or my brothers so
pigmented just so you guys know I have
like a really weird skin condition at
the moment so everything we're going to
look a little worse than my face is what
it usually would have like little bumps
everywhere this foundation and the way
that I set that concealer because it was
so wet just look so bad on my face like
it did not did not see on my skin next
thing that we have here is highlight so
this one is the artist Cachola done and
glow powder and I didn't want this
because I thought it was too dark for me
I'll show you what it looks like I was
going to give this one to my friend but
we might be able to put this underneath
and then put a lot of one over the top
mac fix+ because this stuff goes
everywhere and I'm going to get a little
bit at the lid and go straight on my
face that's cute
this is definitely true dark for me but
if you do have a darker skin tone than
me I think this looks very beautiful
well I guess instead I'm going to take a
color out of the gorgeous Cosmetics
palette and I'm going to pick up these
two shades right here I mix them
together and go straight over the top to
learn that it's touch oh my god you know
what it is wherever I set underneath my
eyes the powder is like stuck and then
right here all the foundation came off
when I was applying the blush and
everything oh my god that's a problem
honestly not all my fault I have a bunch
of liquid lipsticks that I'm going to
get rid of so we have a few from
Crusades just give it in like the colors
then we have a foiled that gloss from
makeup use ODIs
I would never wear this ultimate and
then we have the metal lips by Kylie
cosmetics and again what am I going to
wear a shimmery lipstick like it's just
not going to happen so I think I'm going
to use this one because it's I guess the
least ugliest in a pile so this is
called a hot mess laws weird high shine
latex cool I've honestly never seen
anything like this product but I would
have to say you'd probably need a lip
liner to give your lips that shape
because it kind of like fades off into
the edges oh God I'm honestly not even
gonna bother putting my contacts in
because this is just isn't working for
me but I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I had so much fun filming it
exciting some products I'm going to keep
and the rest that are going in a bin oh
my god this with a star sticky oh give
this video a big thumbs up if you
enjoyed it I love you so much
and I'll see you in my next video hmmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
