put something on really crazy to get me
married ready okay that's heavy Wow all
right let's do this
hey guys it's shiny and welcome to day
two of a week with SHINee I'm uploading
every day on my channel for 5 days so
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already so you don't miss
out on any future videos so in today's
video I'm going to be playing around
with makeup that I never usually lean
towards so it's pretty much just
everything that I've just thrown in the
back of my cupboard and I never use
because I'm a habit of creature Wow did
I really I'm a creature of habit we're
gonna put everything to the test and see
if I still want it in my makeup
collection and we can see we can
rediscover something that's amazing once
again there's a few things in here that
I haven't used before that I've just had
for so long and I just need to use
something so let's go ahead and jump
right into the video
by the way I did get a new lens right
there so you guys can see what's going
on on the eyes and the lips later let's
go ahead and start with the eyebrows so
I'm taking the essence eyebrows stylist
set I haven't used this in so long and I
remember this being one of my all-time
favorites so this comes with a lie Brown
and a dark brown I totally remember this
being my favorite eyebrow product of all
times and then I found like the eyebrow
benefit brow powder no it's like by this
stuff is incredible I just thought let's
just give it another chance hon so I'm
starting by drawing a line above my brow
making the arch nice and high and then I
like to make my stay a little bit longer
you guys know the drill
and then I defined underneath the brow
as well
and let me know what you think of the
new lens is it helpful do you love it do
you hate it is it annoying this product
is still just as good as I used to think
it's amazing and it's so affordable I'm
really happy with that browser on now
let's go ahead and clean them up so I'm
taking the benefit of boying
industrial-strength concealer this one's
in the shade at number one so I've used
this one once and I liked it but I kind
of forget how it goes I'm pretty sure I
never really picked it up again because
it's sorry thick but it does have an
amazing coverage so what I'm gonna do is
just take a little flat brush and clean
up my eyebrows
it's definitely not my favorite
concealer to carve out the brows with
that's for sure just cuz it's so thick
and it's like it's hard to drag the
product across the skin but it did a
good job now taking that concealer all
over my lid just to prime the eyes my
eyes are so sensitive today so I'm
really scared they're just gonna start
watering let's move on to the eyeshadow
so I'm gonna take this one from Sephora
it is the eye contouring eyeshadow
palette in the shade I mean I think it's
in the shade colorful 5 but there's a
sticker over it so there you go but this
one has a bunch of really nice brown
shades in here and I never use this so I
thought let's do it today's the day so
I'm gonna take I'm gonna take the middle
shade right here
it's like a cool turned brown and I'm
putting this in the crease it's super
little so I thought it would be amazing
for like traveling that's really piggy
mintage I mean so far I'm impressed once
I put on rice the color I'm just gonna
blend the edges out a little bit so it's
nice and soft
the next color I'm taking is this one
right here and this one's gonna go
closer to the crease I really just want
to warm it up a little bit but it looks
like this tiny shimmers in it sorry I
don't know how this is gonna go but I
don't really like cool trend shades on
me this is gonna deepen it up as well so
hopefully it looks amazing
then going in with that same color I'm
just gonna pack that on the inner corner
and the outer corner and hopefully we
can do really nice higher cut crease
look so you pretty much just want to
leave the middle free then going back in
with that benefit concealer I'm just
going to do a cut crease in the middle
of my eyelid I have no idea how this is
gonna go honestly I'm scared but that's
okay the next crack that I'm taking is
the fenty beauty galaxy eyeshadow
palette I don't even think I've used
this once maybe once
no nothing so so I'm gonna take this
nice green color down here and we're
gonna pop that right back with that
concealer I'm hoping it's gonna look
stunning um I heard I've hiccups
hopefully I don't need any fix plus cos
oh well no I don't well that's nice I'm
just going to go as close as I can to
that line up here and then I'll go back
in with that talked around so I can
blend over the edges again
alright this clearly is not working
because that Brown kind of fades into
nothing and then when you blend the
glitter of like the Rihanna palette it
goes like really dark and patchy I don't
know so what I'm gonna do to fix that up
is take that green all the way to the
inner corner and then we're gonna put a
black on the outer corner the next thing
I'm taking is a makeup geek eyeshadow in
the shade
and let's be real I never ever got
anywhere near black so this ended in
here perfectly in my opinion this is
definitely one of the best black eye
shutters I just personally don't think I
suit black
then of course going in with that warm
brown I'm gonna blend the edges of that
black let's go in with the mascara so
this one is the Rimmel of volume shake
mascara we're just gonna have to go in
and fix the eyes later but it wasn't the
easiest thing to make work because they
kind of effed up the technique of it cuz
it put the concealer down Oh we'll
figure it out well that mascara is not
bad I think I've used it before actually
it's just been taking my cup let's go
into with the lashes so this brand is
lash doll a boutique I've had these for
so long and it just being chilling they
look really beautiful to start we're
just gonna see how these ones go today
I'm gonna stop by cutting this into the
shape of my eye because I always like to
make sure the lash glue gets tacky on
the fake lash before I put it on it
makes it so much easier to apply right
then we're gonna look down I put my eyes
Dean I'm gonna put the lash on
I'm personally not obsessed with the way
the eyelashes look just because they're
not the right shape for my I feel like
my eye shape
I just want my mascara on there so they
look a bit more like big and fluffy but
I do know I'm not like obsessed with the
eyeshadow though cuz I hate black on my
eyes because you also have that sharp
line I mean I do this is the bye bye
pause primer by it cosmetics I'm just
gonna put some on the back of my hands
and then I'm just gonna stop bilenda ng
it into the middle of my face and oh my
god it honestly oh my god it feels so
soft when it goes on Lord I love the
feel of that my eyes are gonna start
watering soon I'm not ready for this the
next thing I'm taking is the Charlotte
Tilbury or wonder glow instant soft
focus beauty flash so you can put this
underneath foundation or mix it in with
the foundation for a glow so I really
want to see how this looks on my face
I've literally like I think the last
time I use this was like two years ago
so pretty sure that means it's all fried
if I've had it for that long I mean it
smells fine nothing dramatic at all it
just adds a little bit tiny bit of a
glow you can hardly see it so now it's
time for the foundation so I'm taking
this one from La Prairie it is the skin
caviar concealer Foundation and I have
the shade
how did that even happen yet this one's
the shade and the beige so I'm just
gonna shake it out because I actually
have used it once in my life and it was
like the most expensive foundation in
the world I'm pretty sure this was like
five hundred dollars so I'm just taking
this spatula I'm hoping this all over my
face I'm pretty sure the last time I use
this I really liked it but like that was
a long time ago I'm just gonna blend
that in with my Beauty Blender
I've got lots on because the sponge
literally sucks up everything anyway mmm
that's good definitely not worth however
much it is so not gonna wear good skin
looks like a big for the translucent
powder under my eyes I'm taking the Kat
Von D a look at setting powder now I
really want to use this because I'm
thinking that I hate it and I'm pretty
sure I paid it for the longest time
because every time I use it the
concealer like comes off when I brush it
away start I'm just gonna give it one
more chance because I just need to know
cuz literally has happened every time
I've heard just about enough the other
thing that I never use is the wet and
wild at cover all pressed powder this
one's in the shade at medium tan and I
just put it in like my junk box because
um it wouldn't fit in my cupboard so I
couldn't forget how this works I'm
pretty sure it wasn't bad actually which
is amazing because obviously wet and
wild is so affordable I mean it's not
the worst power in the world it
definitely set my face or I'm not mad
next we're going in with that same black
eyeshadow that we put on the outer
corner and I'm gonna take that from the
outer corner to inner corner I'm really
gonna smirk it out I'm just taking that
on a pencil brush look sorry weighted
black I look like a raccoon I look like
a record hmm next step is to blend that
out sorry I'm gonna go in with that
transition shade oh that warm color
right here and I'm gonna smoke that out
underneath that black it's looking a bit
crazy if I don't say so myself
the next thing I'm gonna jury is going
with my benefits BADgal line on this is
the waterproof one and again I don't
like using black because I don't think
it suits me because my eyes are dark and
everything's so dark so I know ease it
but I do really like it
I'm definitely gonna put some eye
contacts in soon so it kind of breaks up
all the blackness here but now for the
brows I'm gonna go in with the NYX that
tinted brow mascara I have a few that I
always stick to you like the benefit one
and the odds are one so let's give this
one a whirl I used to love it yeah see
that's so good hey just so you do it
well I just like the way brow gels like
push all of the heads up it looks very
good let's move on to the bronzer so
this is the designer brands almost
famous contour and highlighting palette
and I'm gonna take the shade hmm I'm
gonna take this color right here we're
just gonna run something face a little
bit you know use this one I just I'm in
my cupboard well liked it I'm also gonna
take that around my hairline as well to
eat it Oh
next I'm gonna take this Nas blush in
the shade impassioned and I usually did
graceful like really like dusty colors
like this but we're gonna give it a go
and see how it looks on my cheeks
usually I feel like rosy shades oh well
it's very pigmented I really am a fan of
that foundation hey it's not looking too
good the next thing that I never ever
grab is the Kylie cosmetics highlight in
the shade salted caramel actually I
don't use any of them I have all of the
shades but I don't know I just I was
never really obsessed with him like they
work well but actually do they even work
well
I know I just don't really like it I
used to think it was a riot like I don't
even want to keep it anymore
next thing I'm taking is a Hutu beauty
lip liner this one's in the shade a
flirt so I'm gonna line my lips with
this never use this I'm really excited
wow that's amazing and then for the
lipstick I'm taking the Estee Lauder
lipstick in the shade 140 Naked City
I've used this once before and I don't
even remember what I thought of it
yeah it's a really like shiny but this
one's like almost like a gloss wow it's
very very long time I love this color I
really don't like how that highlight is
looking on my face it's not like amazing
so I'm going in with a steal a highlight
in the shade kitten I use this once
before and I didn't really like how it
looks either I feel like it's better
than no I feel like this one's really
like a wet so what doesn't Belinda in
probably like it leaves like a line do
it again
damnit I don't like that the last step
is to set my face this is the true face
hangover three-in-one replenishing and
setting spray so I think the last time I
use this it lacked left dots on my face
but I'm not sure I'm scared much comes
out it's actually like I'm putting deer
turn on all right I'm gonna go put some
eye contacts in and fix my head and I'll
be right back so here is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys like
it I put the green contacts in it and I
feel like it looks so much better
because it breaks that darkness up
around my eyes so I think it turned out
pretty well when eyes are going a really
bloodshot right now this start irritated
oh my god if you guys didn't notice
I cut myself some bangs I mean I didn't
call them that's official about my hand
residue oh my hands are flat so don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
guys haven't already and let me know
what you think of this makeup look down
below and we can have a little chat sir
