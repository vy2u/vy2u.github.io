in today's video I'm doing a makeup
tutorial with products that I would
never usually use because I either hate
them or they just don't work for my skin
so let's go ahead and jump into it
because I do have a big bucket full of
makeup that I've honestly touched like
once or twice and I was like no I think
I'm just going to prime my eyes like I
normally do just so what I did with the
eye shadows on that I don't like you'll
be able to see that letter it was even
with the good eye base just so you guys
know some of the products in this video
I genuinely hate and I'm like why did
you even bring this out nothing against
the brand or nothing against you guys if
you do like them but I just thought I
would disclaim that and also the other
products in the video I don't like
because of my fault because I either
were like the wrong shade or the wrong
formula for my skin and I completely
take the blame for that but I thought
let's put it in a video because I'm
never going to use it anyway obviously
if it doesn't work for me so starting
with the I show you the first product
that I really don't like is the NARS
dual intensity eyeshadow so this one's
in the shade tan lines the packaging is
really cute it's a nice color but it's
just not as pigmented as I think it
should be considering it is I have a
high-end brand so I'm going to swatch
this on my hand so you can see this
right there and then I'm going to swatch
it against a Nastasia eyeshadow which
I'm pretty sure it cheaper so I'm just
going to swatch this one up here and
look at my hand you can just see how
sheer that product is like what do you
mean even though this Anastacio product
is a darker shade obviously it smells
more intense you can even tell like in
the formula it's just a lot more buttery
and pigmented and a lot more color comes
off with just one force
so I guess I'll just be taking this in
my crease and seeing what look we can do
it on my blog Jack I do find it a lot
harder to blend as well than like the
regular like and the fuzzier eyeshadows
or like make up figure anything it's
like I'll be sitting here for a while
you keep in mind I am actually still
trying to make this makeup looks nice
I'm not just going to slap it on my face
and be like I can hate it I'm actually
trying okay and then the other shade
that I have right here is also NARS and
this one's called topless it's just
again really sheer and
did you use like makeup you go something
it's just going to like it'd be booming
in your face but you can hardly see this
one actually just could be nice for a
highlight on the cheek because it's like
not over-the-top you know I mean I guess
if you do want literally like the
slightest bit of Sheen to the lid this
would work for you but I just honestly
don't see the point when you can go
something like to pass now let's move on
to the foundation this one is the astata
mineral velvet cream
I bought this like a few months ago for
like $90 because my friend used to use
it Chloe and she said it was really good
and I used to like it back in the day
that's when I had no idea about makeups
I'm like I'm going to get it again I
used to like it back in the day but then
I used it it is completely orange and it
is slower stick but it makes my lines
around here just like look cakey and it
just doesn't look nice on my skin I do
like that it's mineral burr so as you
can see right here this is the
consistency of the foundation it is
realistic okay so let's go in and blend
this onto the face thanks it does have
sunscreen in it though which is good the
last time I used this foundation it was
really Orange on me but I'm guessing
that it didn't have a spray tan on them
so I'll just leave some elbows I
remembered it but I do definitely
remember that it was like really sick
and when I was playing it would get all
cake here on my nose area so I will show
you that later but it's going to take a
while to get to that stage okay so for
concealer I have at this one from la
girl this is the pro conceal and I do
use this in some videos and I probably
will continue to use any videos just
because it is so affordable and I do
like to show the affordable sign of
makeup sometimes sorry the only reason
why I don't like this is because when I
put it under my eyes it leaves like
little chunks of products in the Behrend
doesn't blend out like it looks like
little sand specks under there my friend
actually told me that that happened him
as well and he just bought some new ones
and the other ones were fine so maybe I
have a dad I don't know when I said that
in my last video people like that I have
it to me as well so I know I guess it
happens to the best of us right so I'm
just going to put this right under here
some people love this stuff I'm
obviously going to buy some more because
I know it had potential
let's blender out
the shade is obviously true like fitting
in my bad I have like 20 shades and I
always grab the wrong one but you can
definitely see the little chunks on my
eyes I'm going to do you guys in when I
finish blending so you can see what I'm
talking about so you have all the spots
the concealer has made not keep the next
prep ah and we like both my teeth up
they're just clumped together so hard
the next products that we have here is
from NYX is the HD studio finishing
powder this is a translucent powder so
when I bake underneath my eyes I get the
worst flashback I would never understand
why companies bring out products that
flash back because everyone gets
murdered even without a flash this
flashes back I'm like what are you doing
sorry I'm late I don't know if you can
see that but it looks like this cloud
it's kind of literally looks like snow
it is the cool this powder is like so
finely milled it feels amazing like when
you get your finger and then rub it it's
like the softest thing I've ever felt
but it sucks because if it flashes back
sorry I'm just going to sit underneath
my eyes I'm literally not sticking what
you mean this awful pumping I'm just
going to let this fake
actually no I'm not because that
okay so I'm going to wipe away this bake
and see what we're left with literally
in real life right now I can't see any
wideness on my face I look in the
viewfinder looks like I'm still baking
like what it's all these lights like
flashing it back it's ridiculous okay so
let's move on I will show you guys what
the flash looks like on as well actually
not so funny are you serious I you
anyways let's move on to the face so I'm
going to use the NARS translucent
crystal powder so this is a light
reflecting setting powder in a print
form so this is what it looks like right
here when you swatch it you literally
like this is all you get like a tiny
little Shi
of like what looks like a really not
dramatic highlight of the party is were
the worst thing I've ever tried it just
doesn't my face stiff yeah it is owner I
feel like it's not really doing anything
at all a dirt seat reflecting any light
at all my face it's completely matte
after I've put it on and I don't know I
just feel like I'm basically putting
nothing on my face it does set a little
bit it's definitely not as wet as it was
before but I just feel like this is
completely pointless like I don't I
don't know I just never reach for it I'm
just going to put some eyeshadow
underneath my lash line climbs here so
I'm just doing my mascara with the
Revlon Ultra Volume Mascara it looks
like this so this one is really nice for
the upper lashes it really separates
them it's not true lengthening but it
does add a lot of volume to the lashes
but honestly if you ever use a mascara
with a massive one like this stay away
from the lower lashes because it is so
easy to bump the skin under there and
then the whole lower lash line is black
and as much and it's just not a fun time
there's an inner corner Homer where is
it okay literally though where is it now
for the eyebrows so this one is the
Anastacio brow definer this is an angled
brow pencil so I bought this like a year
ago and I've used it once ever since it
ever since I bought it so I do like it I
have this bully on one end but oh ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ok I missed watch
this please you guys can see what I'm
dealing with
it is so waxy that one just broke it is
so waxy and dry that when I put it on my
eyebrows my it literally pulls out my
brow hair and hurts and it's just really
hard to get that really nice like nice
brow I just caught his car
I just feel like it's so hard to get
like that out of like tail area to make
it nice and sharp like what is that and
then underneath to make it really define
like a really nice straight line it's
the reason why this is all like smudgy
down here because I had to press really
hard for the like color to actually show
off here I mean and then by the time I
was pressing hard it was all the way
half my damn I think so I'm like mister
I'm never use Matt again yes okay so
let's move on to the face I feel like
this is going to be so much fun so right
here I have the Mac extra dimension skin
finish in the shade shaft of gold I'm
pretty sure this is a highlighter well
it was on the highlighter stand and I
bought it for myself and then I go home
and I was like oh I can't leave
they sold it to me it's literally going
to be like a bronzer on me if you do
have dark skin I think this will look so
stunning because it's just like a really
nice deep gold but I just like she knew
what the mean why did she let me buy
this because that's definitely gently
not going to work for a highlighter I'm
actually trying to use it as a bronzer
and see like what it looks like it can
be so shimmery
obviously would there's off this is
obviously my fault for lying around
shame not playing the work or anyone
else I am smart enough to know that this
is true dark to me I just was too
excited I just wanted it because I heard
so many people talking about it okay
maybe not of course I'm going to bake
with my favorite NYX powder just under
my bronzer because I always write down
through fall I can't wait to take this
off this powder literally smells like
corn flour I literally bought that last
week to play with it
sort of like what are you doing child
it's fun maybe I can play with it now
it's time to the highlighter so this one
is from Urban Decay it is the Naked
illuminating trio so the only reason I
don't like this is because the chunks in
this are so stiff it kind of just looks
like you're putting glitter on your face
I'd give her Sara highlighter that is
just like really finely milled and it's
really intense and beautiful even if
it's not intense I just don't like to go
with the rate chunks you don't I mean so
I'm going to take this shade right here
and put this on so you can see what I'm
talking about
what I do swatch you can see like little
sparkles going everywhere as well so
it's not just
good motion likes puzzles I'm just going
to spray some 60-plus on my brush so you
guys can see like full pijl I guess this
would be cool for like a festival
wouldn't it good next we have blush so
this one is from Becca don't get me
wrong I love the back of blushes this is
a purely my fault for getting the wrong
shade do you serious this is so intense
and these the most pigmented blushes
you'll ever come across or the fact that
it's that intense or the color you're
going to have to literally like barely
touch your face at all so let's see what
this looks like because there's no way I
have ever uses and there's nowhere I
will ever use this again because look at
it last okay oh my god I literally wiped
off as much as I could it stained my
brush and it is just like a big pink dot
I could literally just sit here all day
just blending this out but it's not
going anywhere because there's so much
product on my cheek and I honestly tried
really hard to just make that work okay
so I'm just going to skip the lashes
because I don't have any that I don't
like and let's be real emotion myself as
soon as I'm done see you guys let's see
you onto the lips I'm using the kylieqq
I'm a Justi liquid lipstick I write
always you serve I just like every show
that should come out with just because
I'm like yay Kylie's products I want to
buy everything but like why did I buy
this well it is a blur with a silver
like shimmers in it and I just like I
would never wear this in a million years
so gonna do it today so smells
absolutely stunning there let's be real
with Kylie on the way this color
probably not just keep in mind that it's
only the color that I don't like I love
the formulas of the liquid lipsticks
from Kylie that amazing love another
thing is you definitely do need to do
like three or two coats to make it like
as intense as it is in the bottle okay
so here we have the finished and makeup
look this is the ugliest thing I've ever
seen in my life honestly I tried to make
this work
let's do a quick overview of the whole
face so the foundation is looking a
little bit cakey around this area right
here my nose is completely separated I
don't know if that was the foundation or
the concealer either way like it's not
really working for me the concealer
isn't through bad again I do use that
all the time and I kind of try and make
it work anyway but it's just a little
specks that it did leave this obviously
wasn't supposed to be a bronzer but I
was just playing around the blush isn't
for my skin honey if you do have darker
skin tone I think it would look amazing
on you just like this one right here the
highlighter kind of looks like I've just
blown glitter on my face it doesn't
really work for me with like a full glam
or even like an everyday look because it
is so chunky the glitter may be a
festival as I said before and that for
the brows I never use mannequin ever in
my time I like picky and then the
eyeshadow has gone really ashy when I
put it on like I'm not feeling it at all
it's just not working and then the lips
yeah don't even worry about that is my
fault I'm so sorry I'm really sorry and
then the back edge is surprised the
worst thing like yeah it's the worst
thing of the whole look like never buy
this see I just thought if something has
HD photogenic on it it means that you
can take photos with it no you can't
