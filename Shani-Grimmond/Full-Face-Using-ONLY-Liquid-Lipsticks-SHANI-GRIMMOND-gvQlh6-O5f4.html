my channel so in today's video I'm doing
the full face of liquid lipsticks I feel
like going to be the biggest sale ever
I've seen so many people do these
challenges and they actually actually
look amazing and I feel like I'm just
gonna completely flop it but we're just
gonna try and see what happens so the
rule is you can only use liquid
lipsticks and let me just start by
telling you I pretty much only have
pinks oranges and reds
I have literally like two skin tone
shade so I don't know how this is gonna
work let's just dive into it okay so I'm
gonna start out with my dose of colors
liquid lipstick in the shade and this is
my favorite liquid lipstick ever so I'm
hoping by the end of this video I'm
still gonna have a bit left in here I
mean this is going to be the foundation
so I'm just going to slap it on my face
we've got to work quickly because it is
a liquid lipstick okay Wow gorgeous
match okay let's blend it oh my god well
let me start by saying this has zero
coverage quite disappointed in this I'm
kidding this is literally the best brand
for liquid lipsticks I love them so much
gorgeous I feel like it's gonna be so
hard to take off when I'm done I'm
literally like diving straight in the
shower after this video I don't want any
breakouts tomorrow it's hardly any left
in here
and it blends out pretty good for a
liquid lipstick not going to lie but
this is a lot harder than it looks
trust me just put some eye primer on but
actually covered my veins pretty well
might use this on the daily you ever ran
out of foundation just grab a liquid
lipstick why not okay I look half bald
so I'm just gonna take my hair out so I
kind of look like a human again now it's
time for blush honey bear so I'm taking
the overall liquid lipstick in the shade
out is a really nice nudey pink
shades I'm just gonna put a dot on my
cheeks and go from there these are
really pigmented so I'm not gonna put
too much on
I'm use the same brush because I do not
want to ruin all of my brushes only one
Wow but didn't really work okay a bit
more then this is the weirdest thing
I've ever done not gonna lie oh those a
lot my face is already pink I don't know
why I'm adding more pink bindi hey hey
yo I love my how like every time I bring
her in a video she's like in the lights
too bright for you baby
the next product I'm taking it's from
the Kylie cosmetics range it's in the
shade hair so I'm just going to put this
straight on an eyeshadow brush and just
pack this on the top of my cheekbones as
a highlighter I love a really intense
highlighter like any time in the day so
I'm just really gonna go crazy with this
one it still has a glow to it so I'm
happy but in everyday makeup where I
like to be shimmery and glittery and
just over the top you know wearing like
five hundred pumps of this on my brush
I'm just going to put a little bit on
the tip of my nose to highlight there
and to make my nose look like I've been
sunburned I'm going to try and keep it
basic on the eyes so I'm gonna take the
shade Kim K the same ones we used before
so a nice shimmery shade and I'm just
gonna put this all over my lid
and then we're going to blend it out
this is a really nice like gold shimmery
color this could actually work as an
eyeshadow well if I mean the color could
work as an eyeshadow not the formula so
I'm just gonna blend upwards really
lightly I think it's already dry so it's
not really blending hello oh no this is
getting messy guys it's getting real
messy real quick
now with this shade rain I'm gonna put
this on my lower lash line um I just
want a little pop of color you know this
is like a really nice dark maroon color
I'm just gonna put it directly on my
brush and put it as close I can to my
lashline
oh my god this could be dangerous for
the eyes oh god I don't know if the
lighting just got really bad or if my
faces just look this bad the whole
entire time but let's move on to the
hardest part I'm going to take some
black liquid lipstick and make a liner
like a line hoping liner I can't even do
this with normal liner so I don't know
why I'm even bothering to try this with
liquid lipstick I mean here is nothing
let's just say who didn't really work
out
let's look past all of my imperfections
and move on to the lashes shall we so
I'm just gonna dip a spoolie into my
black liquid lipstick and use this as
mascara it's kind of like they're
getting tinted I like that'd be so cool
if I go eyelashes tinted I'll look into
it it's like a little test run because I
don't have any Brown products that's why
I can't contour I'm just going to use
whatever's left in the spoolie and run
this through my brows just to add a
little bit of color because you can
never leave the browser really I mean
come on
hope you disaster I'm gonna take the
shade Bellaire by over again and this is
what I'm using on my lips this is
literally gonna be the only thing that's
going to look normal on my whole face
would it be bad if I just cheated a
little bit and added a pair of falsies I
feel like it'll just bring the whole
look together and it'll hide this a
little coming over here I'll be back
now just going in and adding a bit of my
highlighter that I put right here on my
inner corners so love a good glow and
it's not really giving the effect that
I'd hoped it just looks like I put a bit
of pink shit in my eye like a clock pink
I got it last but not least I'm gonna
take a little bit of my foundation dose
of colors and sand again and I'm just
gonna put this on the on my lips because
I don't really like pink on my lips I
like more of a nudey pink so this is
what I usually do but I use it like a
normal person I just put it right over
the top and then I just blend it out and
it kind of just makes whatever color you
put down first a lighter version
I love it times like these I really wish
I had a lip liner because it looks like
I have a serious case of pash rash all
around my mouth cause like smudging
everywhere but guys I think this is the
best we're gonna get so that we have the
finished makeup look guys I hope you
enjoyed it it was nothing serious don't
take this video seriously just a little
bit of fun mucking around honestly I
probably should have gone and bought
some brown color liquid lipsticks before
I did this video because I literally
just look like a tomato like someone
could just come up to me and take a big
chunk out of my head and it wouldn't
even hurt because I'm edible but anyways
if you guys enjoyed this video please
give it a big thumbs up because it helps
me out so so much I love you and I'll
see you very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
