so I'm here with peanut today I actually
don't know if that's his name still but
that's what I call him all the time hey
Tina Tina so in today's video I'm doing
a a wonder brand tutorial the brand that
I'm going to be using today is NYX
Cosmetics I only had a few things in my
makeup collection that was from NYX it
is a really affordable brand so I
thought why not do a full face and see
how it turns out so I have a bunch of
brand new products in front of me and
I'm so excited to play around with them
so if you guys haven't subscribed to my
channel already don't forget to do that
and let's go ahead and jump into the
video as per usual I'm going to start
out by doing my eyebrows and I'm going
to be using the eyebrow cake powder this
one looks really good all the colors
look good anyway so let's see how it
goes I'm going to start by taking this
lighter brown right here and we're going
to make my brows more defined starting
by drawing a line on top of my brows oh
my god this is honestly working it so
well I feel like I'm going to start
using this a lot the pigmentation is
really good it's really soft and easy to
apply on the brows yay we're off to a
good start
I'm so happy with how my brows look
right now so the next step is concealer
to conceal underneath the brows to make
them super sharp and also to get rid of
all of these things on the eyelids don't
want that so I'm taking the above and
beyond a full coverage concealer it was
so hard to choose the color for these
concealers because they looked a very
pink it's going to wipe all like the
excess oil off my eyelid because all of
the concealer usually creases in my
natural oils first impression it is very
creamy so it's really easy to blend out
and then with a really big brush I'm
just going to take this all over my
eyelid too can't slap that discoloration
I actually really like the color I'm not
mad at that
it's definitely covering most things I
need covered I just wouldn't say as full
coverage as like the ones that I usually
use like the top shape tape and stuff
but I mean that's a given because those
ones are like three dollars
pretty sure this is like 10 I'm just
going to use this white eyeshadow right
here to set this down I always sit down
my eye base ok that does look a little
bit chalky when I put that down
next I'm going to take this shade right
here this reminds me a lot of the Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek so I'm just
going to just add a transition shade I'm
just going to put this right here so the
other colors can blend into it you guys
know the drill and by the way the brush
I'm using is a Mac two to four I use
this in every video it's just so easy to
blend up all of the colors Russe next
I'm going to take the highlight and
contour palette and I'm going to pick up
at this wormy chocolate kind of brown
right here and this is going a little
bit underneath that last shade that we
put on I love this contour palette this
is something that I've had for a really
long time I reach for it all
the next color I'm taking is this a
really deep rich brownie black color and
I'm taking out a smaller blending brush
this one is the Kylie cosmetics one this
is actually really good it reminds me a
lot of like this Sigma I think it's like
t25 it's pretty much the exact same like
the morphe blending brushes okay so I'm
just going to put this right in my
crease kind of scared this colors really
 ugly not going to lie yeah this
is vintage like a black with like a hint
of brown in it not what I usually go for
but I'm actually going out tonight like
I'm going out for drinks my friend's
birthday so if this looks bad um a milk
bad the whole night so you can so I
think the lending for quite a while and
it's not like it's not bad like I'm
actually really impressed with the
eyeshadow but it's definitely not
blending as well as like my favorite
like huda beauty or like and it stars
yeah but like obviously these are so
much cheaper I'm just really trying to
well in that patch away but it's not
really going anywhere or we're gonna
have to move on
okay so next I'm going in with this
consider again and I'm going to make a
cut crease so I'm just going to form and
then you'll see what I'm doing next I'm
actually really excited for the arch
other
so I'm just using a small concealer
brush to cut the crease I'm done with
cutting the crease now I'm going to
choose between these two colors to see
what I want on the lid so we could do a
really nice green or a purple I'm just
going to swatch them and see what they
look like oh that is such a pretty color
holy okay let's do this oh my god
that color is amazing I'm really going
to pack it on so it's super intense the
eyes may look a little bit weird until
we have lashes on but I think it looks
really cool except for the fact that
I've really stuffed up the shape of the
corners are completely different that's
okay so next I'm going in with the angel
veil primer this one is actually really
good it smooths my skin a lot I use this
one all the time so I'm just going to go
in on a little brush a little wormies
then we're going to blend it and it just
makes a safe to look at babied but oh
now it's time for the foundation so I'm
taking the stay matte not flat
foundation in the shade zero true nude
I'm actually so scared because elderly
like five colors there and they did not
look like they're going to match me so
just put me on the back of my hand it
actually does not too bad I'm going to
blend this in up with my B notes or
yellow
like what's neither my foundations or
eyes really off
what can you do I'll just introduce
myself as Bart Simpson tonight oh well
it looks really nice on my skin because
medium coverage and it's blending out
really nicely it doesn't look too cakey
I just wish sorts more colors I'm sure
there is that they just would have
stopped them at my tache next I'm taking
the same at but not flat foundation
powder so let's see if this will make my
face a little yes like you know yellow
oh it feels really silky and it looks
like it has a little bit of coverage so
let's do this
God I hit my face so hard when I set my
hand open
oh my god I didn't do my concealer what
the that is so not like me okay so
quickly doing concealer I'm hurting it
with the powder up too high oh my god so
I'm going to dip the edge of my Beauty
Blender in here oh my god that was so
intense I've never done that
oh no I have a feeling this concealer
look really ashy underneath my eyes
fully better putting foundation on there
to be honest now I'm going in with the
NYX to highlight and contour pro palette
and I'm going to stay underneath my eyes
using this banana shade I may as well
make the rest of my face yellow is under
my eyes daily like I seriously okay this
concealer I hate everything about it
even when I did my eyes with it like
primed my eyes it made them really like
oh that just looks really gross and like
grainy like it didn't blend out into
like one smooth color eyes like chunky
I'm actually like really lightly patting
down that concealer and it's just like
blending into nothing I wouldn't
recommend that anyway he's back to the
powder might be a little bit under my
eye so we can get rid of that yellowness
a bit cool to be honest or I like this
powder actually
now let's move on to underneath the eyes
so I'm going to pick up that crease
color again and I'm just going to take
that from outer corner all the way to
inner corner and to do that I'm going to
use a large pencil brush now it's time
to set my brows so I'm taking the brow
mascara and I'm going to shade brunette
I'm just going to brush them straight up
I've been loving that look lately on my
blog this works so well it's separating
every single hair makes it look really
full and for the mascara I'm taking the
SRO lashes I'm just going to pop this on
the top and bottom lashes oh my god I
think this has fibers in it no whore I
hate those mascara is because all the
fiber drops onto your cheek throughout
the day it's really not doing too much
to my lashes like it's not making them
extra long or sick Lisa it's making them
black oh okay so just quickly I'm going
to go ahead and add some false lashes I
don't know if Nick's Happiny it's like
during they didn't have any at the
target that I was shopping at so I'll be
right back let's go back in without
contouring palette so I'm going to take
that same crease color that were you
because I love warm turn contour shade
I'm just going to allow people to pop
that in my cheekbones something that I
actually really do like you know what so
everything that I've used so far has
been really good except for the
foundation color not the formula and
then the concealer as a whole because I
was so bad like it's a joke but
everything else looks really good so far
so I'm also going to put this around my
hairline as well because I don't have a
bronzer so I'm going to really brand up
the face with this car now it's time for
the blush I'm taking this one in the
shade amber this one's a really pretty
pinky coral shade so I'm just going to
put this on the apples of my cheeks and
then blend it back but since we do have
that green going on I'm only going to
put a little bit on virtually pigmented
sir a little bit
and then for the highlight I'm going to
take it in this color right here I know
you Samba for actually so I'm super
excited
holy pigmented that is really intense it
kind of has like a purple reflex to it
so like this would work really well on
pale skin actually like it though I
might want to actually involve like my
face and look as yellowy more ya know I
forgot to use the liquid illuminator
that would have been so good what that
highlighter was already intense enough
so let's move on mm why are you making
so much noise do you think my face is
too yelling you said oh my laughs then
you usually used to sit on my lap sermon
okay so the lip liner that I'm using is
okay is that for the retractable lip
liner in the shade Oh Vanilla Sky there
we go so I'm just going to outline my
lips this is seriously so easy to use I
love retractable lip pencils because you
have to get a sharpener out it's just so
easy very impressed I've used this for
years so now it's time for the lipstick
I'm taking this nude shade it looks
really good in the bullet but when i
swatched it at the shop it was like was
it my favorite but we'll see how it goes
oh it's just so liquidy like literally
look at the difference of the bullet to
that what's on my lips this is like
foundation this is like a nice nude well
even if this was a nice color I feel
like this would be one of those
lipsticks such as get all over your
teeth because the formula is so creamy
like it's that creamy that'll just slide
right off so instead I'm going to take
the lingerie liquid lipstick look people
say this is really drying so I don't
know how this is going to go oh it's
very strictly when you apply it it's
very light
okay I would not classify that as a
liquid lipstick if that's what it's
supposed to be is it yeah and then
lastly I'm going to finish my lips off
with the butter gloss in a shade fortune
cookies I've loved all the butter
glosses ever since I was a fetus it was
like one of my first makeup products
that I bought I love the shade a creme
brulee that one's my favorite this one
is a little bit too left me black eye
conditions the only one I've got at the
moment don't know where the other ones
are gone I used to have a million ah
although we've got stolen or my house
got broken into you haven't seen that
video I'll leave it down below it's so
interesting last but not least I'm going
in with the NYX Julie finishing a
setting spray I'm just going to put this
on the sides of my face okay so now I'm
going to go fix this situation and I'll
be right back okay so here we have the
finished a look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and learn something
new maybe some products to buy and maybe
some products you should stay away from
like the concealer and the foundation
color unless you're literally Bart
Simpson make sure you give this video a
big thumbs up because it helps me add so
much I may go let me show you my nails I
got them done the other day they look so
cute
yaaaaah um so I'm definitely not wearing
this makeup out tonight like that's just
not happening I think I'm going to keep
the eyeshadow on and then take like
everything else off I mean I like the
high line that the cheek area but
obviously just like the foundation color
and stuff internally clients have
anyways I love you guys so so much and I
will see you in my next video hmmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
