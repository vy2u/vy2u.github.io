today's video I'm doing something really
strange I don't even know why I'm doing
it I just thought it would be really fun
so a few days ago I saw Michael do his
full face using only one eyeshadow
palette so I thought I would try it I
was like what is he doing but Here I am
doing it myself so I'm gonna use the
mecca max eyes to the max a mega potti
palette just because this has pretty
much everything in it that I need like
all the shades we have like a foundation
color contour we have blush highlight
are the only thing that I'm gonna use
like the only makeup product I think is
just gonna be false eyelashes because if
I use just like black all my lashes it's
just not gonna look cute so we use false
eyelashes and then everything else is
gonna be out of this eyeshadow palette
so I'm a little bit nervous but I think
it's gonna be fun because I mean like I
don't think it's gonna look good at all
but we'll see I'm gonna start by
moisturizing up my face just so we have
a base for the palette to sit on I was
in a safe the foundation to sit on nope
not today
okay so first I'm gonna start with my
eyeshadows so if we have any fallout I'm
just gonna clean up under my eyes so I
guess I'm going to do something kind of
simple today I'm gonna start with this
shade right here and I'm gonna pop this
in my crease as a transition and it's
gonna be really weird
not like concealing my lids I'm actually
a little nervous for this usually I
always prime my lids slowly cuz you can
still see the veins the eyeshadow now
taking a smaller brush I'm gonna go in
where that this shade right here and
deepen up the crease just a little bit
so I'm just gonna look down and put that
right in the crevices can I just say
that it is actually really hot in
Australia right now and the only reason
I'm wearing a big jacket is because my
tan on my wrist
uhsorry bad so I'm trying to hide it but
I don't know if it's worth the pain at
this stage and lastly I'm gonna take
this really pretty bronzy gold shade and
I'm just gonna pop that all over my lid
so we can have a little bit
Shema oh that's sorry pretty okay if
your prime your eyes and you feel like
your eyeshadow isn't looking the best
this is a perfect example as to why you
should prime your eyes otherwise your
eyeshadow will probably look something
like this it honestly makes the biggest
difference this is the worst well like
not the actual product but like the way
it looks without the primer it's like
definitely a problem I'm actually
horrified for this okay so I'm gonna go
in with this color here as my foundation
and I'm just gonna stop bull running
this on my face Wow and to think this is
gonna look semi-decent
nice okay i'm gonna mix it in with this
lot of shade here i'm gonna go with
these two shades i feel like this um i
shadow palette is gonna be like gone by
the time i actually use it properly as
an eye shutter okay let's put it this
way imagine if you was stranded on an
island and you only had an eyeshadow
palette to do your makeup sometimes
you've just got to make do with what
you've got because that's totally gonna
happen right you're gonna be stranded
with with just an eyeshadow palette I
can just imagine my pimples tomorrow
after this video I'm gonna have to make
sure to wash my brushes so well after
this otherwise I'm gonna be applying my
makeup normally and my makeup she's
gonna look so what she I'll be wondering
why okay I'm gonna go in with this
lighter shade and put that under my eyes
and I'm also you're gonna put that
around my face as well because I feel
like it's definitely like super orange
actually I'm gonna go in with a little
brush and pack this on
Wow canceling out all that discoloration
just what I want and what's gonna pick
up a little bit of the white shade as
well so we can highlight I love how I'm
saying it like like it's just a normal
makeup look you just highlight under the
eyes I mean that kind of cancels
discoloration a little bit and I'm gonna
take that lattice ship no I'm not I'm
gonna take that medium shade it down my
nose just cuz I want to cover those
little freckles I come over them always
peeking through so I'm just gonna go in
and add this shade over the bits that
are a little bit blotchy so we can look
even it out just a smidge I just had to
crank up that light behind me because
there was looks like black lines going
through it was really annoying
all right so next we're gonna go in on
the lower lash line sorry I'm gonna take
that brown call that we put in the
crease and I'm just gonna put that on my
lower lash line this pug boring because
like we've all seen this let's be real
my face is like a wedge shade of pink
and my neck is like a weed shade of
yellow like that I understood okay so
now time for the eyebrows I'm gonna take
this shade right here that is not the
shade of my eyebrows this is gonna be
very interesting oh wow that's pigmented
so I guess we can try and reshape them
but don't how this is gonna grow
I mean it's better than nothing bad oh
my god that looks so good oh I'm really
happy with this one
flashes are going on honey I mean this
is gonna make it look a little bit
better the next thing I'm gonna do is go
in with this a black eye shutter and I'm
just gonna line up my lash line my top
lash line because you can really see
where the real lash and the fake lash
meet we to hide that I mean note that
we're feeling anyone here but I'm just
gonna take an angled brush and and we'll
just smirk out that lash line
okay now the lashes are on we're looking
a little bit better still looking a
little rough around the edges but let's
work with it so the next color I'm gonna
take is this one right here and I'm
gonna mix that with this color so we're
gonna do a little bit of a bronzey look
today I mean I feel like this is gonna
be a lot easier than the foundation
that's for sure oh my gosh okay I'm
gonna go in with our foundation color
and a little bit of the white and I'm
just gonna put that underneath whatever
situation is going on here because it's
super muddy you need to clean it up
you needs help okay I'm just gonna take
a bigger brush and blend out all of that
contouring mess because it is super dark
and I just want to fade a little bit you
know what if I just angle my face like
straight I feel like you can't really
see how bad this is but as soon as I'm
like oh hey it's like what's happening
okay next I'm gonna mix these two colors
right here and I'm gonna use that as
blush and I'm going to use the same
foundation
kind of brush oh my god that's sorry
pigment today I'm gonna put a little bit
in the back of my hand first
oh that was easy nice little flush of
color
Elisa's can kind of like hide the
muddiness you know what I mean
Conda now we can go in with a highlight
shade so I'm gonna take this color right
here and I'm gonna mix a tiny bit of
this one and we're going to go into town
oh no oh no that is very ashy oh right
maybe I'll use a different brush oh
that's better I mean that's not bad okay
I feel like it's necessary to fix my
hair now so we can kind of like cover
all of our mistakes I feel like that's
like a really good idea okay so for the
lip color I'm gonna take oh I really
don't know what to do I might take like
this pink and this pink right here I
have a little type of lip balm on my
lips or I guess that'll like help it
look a little bit better I'm just gonna
Pat this on my lips oh my god key I'm
just gonna take my brush and pack this
on so it's nice and sharp
who needs lip liner when you have
eyeshadow really okay so I guess we have
the finished makeup look right here I
hurt you guys enjoyed it it was
definitely a weird video but I had fun I
feel like it looks really um what's the
word I'm looking for you know definitely
looking a little bit rough maybe um we
can compare it to like when you go out
clubbing you get home at 5:00 a.m. you
sleep in your makeup and you wake up and
you're like wow my makeups still kind of
on that's what it looks like and I'm I'm
quite impressed I mean I did use one
eyeshadow palette like not bad so if you
