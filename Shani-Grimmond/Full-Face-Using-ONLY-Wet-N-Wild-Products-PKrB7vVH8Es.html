so in today's video I'm doing a full
base using only a wet and wild makeup so
here in Australia I find it so hard to
get one wild makeup the only place that
I can get it is online so that's what
I've done today I've gone online and
I've got every single step which I'm
super excited about because some of
these products look so amazing so this
for you guys that can get wet loud
really easily because this brand is
super super affordable and what the hell
everything's literally under $10 a what
II mean how does that happen
I just did my eyebrows off camera
because I honestly cannot stand watching
other people do the eyebrows over and
over I found it so boring so let's move
on to the eye shadow I'm going to take
this eyeshadow collection and this is in
the shade drinking a glass of shine and
the first color that I'm going to take
is this color right here which looks
like a perfect transition shade so I'm
just going to take this on my blending
brush and you know what to do pop this
in here oh my god that is a really
pigmented and it's blending like actual
butter this is literally a blending out
better than a part that I use the other
day which is the high end so I'm really
impressed with this the next color that
I'm taking is this a really nice
chocolate deep brown color and I'm just
going to swap brushes this one is a
little bit more pointed so this is going
in my crease under that last color and
of course going in with that lighter
shade I'm just going to blend it around
the edges to make sure it's seamless
because it does look a little bit messy
at the moment next up I'm going to go in
with this a really nice purple color and
I'm just going to pack this on my inner
and outer half of my eyelid add a bit of
color in there I'm just using a flat
shader brush this one is a Weaver holy
crap this color is showing up so
beautifully I'm using a smaller brush to
press the color on its inner corner so
it can be nice and precise and then I'm
going to take another eyeshadow palette
it's like Aldi at Studio actually
palette and this one has a really nice
gold shade in it so I'm going to pick up
the disc gold right here
that on the middle of Aled I'm gonna
overlap this with the purple now for
Moscato sheer I'm going to go in with
the max volume on or waterproof I
freaking hate water in scars but it's
all I've got from Wet n Wild so let's go
in the brush actually looks really good
just making sure it's not off it's
really getting into every single lash
which is good
makes me nice and black oh my god I
actually really like this mascara y'all
come on okay so I'm just gonna go put
some lashes on and I'll be right back
because I don't very put in world sells
license let's move on to the primer so
I'm gonna go in with this photo focus
face primer and I'm just going to put
this on the back of my hand
oh and then I'm going to work in my skin
with a brush because I have like
with my fingers right now it feels
really moisturizing and spin which is a
good start for me that's really nice for
the foundation I'm taking the photo
fonda tint foundation in the shade
golden beige this color looks really
nice okay oh my god it has no SPF in it
which is amazing and I didn't hear that
when Maya was cruelty free so that is
incredible oh this is spatula I love
love that
thanks so much what's really runny only
now I'm gonna go in it with my beauty
blender and blend it out wow it has
really really nice medium coverage I
have put a lot on as well so I'm hoping
it builds up really nicely oh my god
this foundation looks so good and it
feels really light on my skin just love
the finish of it it's not um it's not
completely matte but it definitely is
more on the matte side
the only other product that I don't have
from wet involved is concealer so I'm
just going to quickly go ahead do my
concealer and then I'll be back I will
order some online so I can use them in
my videos soon
say I heard about that I literally
forgot about it I don't know how now
it's time for the patter so I'm taking
this cover all pressed powder in the
shade at medium tan as I set the side of
the year I bought everything online so
I'm really happy that everything is
matching really well it's very very
powdery go ahead and grab this on the
face okay it's not making my face patchy
just under my eyes it almost feels like
I don't even need to set my face because
the foundation literally dried like kind
of Matt but I'm to do it anyway okay
let's move on to the lower lash line I'm
going to take this dark brown from outer
corner to inner corner on a little tiny
pencil brush I've never done this with
lashes on before through like I what
would be bad sitting out there I
definitely have to get heaps more
pallets I can use weight and while in my
because more can't forget those lower
lashes because under here is super dark
so I want to make some by the leg oh my
God my face is here so we're going to be
so shimmery after this because my bronze
and everything Alex loves shimmer so the
first plan I'm going in with is to
reflect shimmer palette in the shade of
rose gold and goddess and if you guys
see my snapchat you would know what
happened when I ordered it I literally
accidentally ordered 24 of these that's
why the box so big I can't speak a word
that much but yeah I did it has a really
nice glow to it
fight I would have to say it's probably
a little bit too light for me I like
really dark roses
alright definitely does build up through
that I'm also going to take this around
my forehead to warm everything up spit
I'm just going to take the edge of my
powder brush and take that crisp add off
just to clean up this line right here
she goes near me I always get so carried
away
for the blush I'm taking this one which
is ombre oh my god how freakin pretty
and fat so this one is in machined what
the princess
to query so I'm just going to pop my
brush mainly on the darker side and I'm
just going to put this on the apples of
my cheeks so with all of this resolution
isn't as well my face is going to be
going on another level it's sorry wakers
in some lights the bronzer doesn't
require intense then I move my head and
it goes like orange like an illusion so
I have two highlighters from hey girl no
but I'm surprised it didn't break so
this one right here and this one which
has four different colors than ever to
be honest this one looks amazing so and
today this one's in the shade at
precious pearls and it looks like a
beautiful gold champagne color and I
just really want to watch it to see what
it feels like it literally feels like ah
I really wish I would sell more wet'n
wild rocks in Australia this is so
unfair
okay so let's do this oh my gosh this is
amazing I did not expect this
oh my nose I'm going to put a little bit
of this highlighter right on my inner
corner to bratton that area up become
very room for the lips I have two
different colors here we have a pink and
a brown nude so I'm going to take a
brand new dude and you have this curves
just because the pink isn't going to
match the purple on my eyelid so let's
see this one is in the shade nudie
patootie that's only one source gets is
going to be true light for me oh it's so
gray I really like the formula obviously
called it sleek but I think I was good
till I was dead so I'm going to take a
lipliner
this one isn't a shade seven one two and
I'm just going to like to basically use
this as a lipstick like put it all over
my lips oh my god so if you can just up
I really like the color of this lip
liner so your limits will nude color and
elastin at least I'm taking a setting
spray or license upload is it says photo
focus vaporizer D fixation setting spray
on the other side okay wow that sprays
out a lot lucidly little white specks on
my face okay I need to go fix this whole
thing so I can what keep you guys
alright guys here we have the finished
makeup look I had to take my strategy
shirt off because it was so much in the
vibe but I really hurt you guys enjoyed
today's video I'm overall so incredibly
impressed like pretty much every single
product I used is there anything I
didn't like nope I like everything so I
just need to get a contour shade and a
concealer and lashes if they have any
but I hope this video was interesting
for you guys considering how cheap and
affordable freaking wet mile is you're
kidding me so I love you guys so much
