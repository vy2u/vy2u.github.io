today's video I'm doing a full face of
makeup using only foundation so it's a
little weird but I'm actually really
excited to do this video I so
laura-leigh do this video and I'm like
oh my god this sounds so much fun so I'm
gonna do it so I'll leave her channel
down below if you guys want to check her
out she's amazing
so I have a bunch of different shades
here from the nice foundation this one
is the Naz natural radiant long wear
foundation so as you can see there's so
many different colors in here so I'm
going to be using a lot of those and
then I also have a bunch of my favorite
foundations much of my favorite
foundation is here that we're gonna use
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
oh and by the way we're gonna make the
exception of false lashes I have full
Beauty blenders here so I'm ready to go
the first foundation that I'm going to
use is the hourglass vanish stick this
one's in the shade warm beige I've been
using this one for quite a while now and
I am obsessed with it because I have
quite dry skin it leaves like a really
nice to Julia finish to my face so I'm
just gonna pop this all over and I love
this shade as well it's like the perfect
neutral tone you know the one thing I'm
worried about is my eyebrows in my lips
and I don't know how to do blush but
we'll figure it out so I'm just gonna
take a kabuki brush because this one's
quite a thick foundation I'm gonna buff
this into my skin I'm so obsessed with
this necklace as well if you guys are
wondering where it's from its from
beginning boutique thank you
I was just untangling it for like 15
minutes before this video fun now it's
time for the concealer I'm going in with
the knobs foundation in the shade light
for so I'm just gonna dab this
underneath my eyes and then hopefully
it'll cancel a discoloration and
highlight underneath there I really hope
this looks like semi-decent
I'm just excited oh there's a spatula
beautiful I'm just excited to see how it
looks at the end okay I can't set any of
this liquid sir I'm gonna crease in a
lot and I'm worried about that
okay I'm gonna blend this out
what the perfect tail light shade that
looks amazing
I mean people probably use foundations
concealer all the time so it's not too
groundbreaking and you put some clear
icing cuz oh my gosh I'll just banging
on my own sorry hard alright so next I'm
gonna take medium dock 3.6 and I'm gonna
use this as an eyeshadow like a little
transition shade so I'm just gonna put a
little bit on the back of my hand
right here and then I'm gonna blend it
into my crease like I literally don't
know how this is gonna guard by I should
probably just synthetic brush you know
the crazy oh this is gonna be a mess I'm
just gonna have to keep wiping it away
alright let's go in with a little
transition had some death holdin
everything I don't really know what else
I can really do I mean it's working
pretty well like it's adding a little
bit of definition maybe I should just
put that color on where you know what
I'll do I'll go with like dark around
and I'll put that like all over my later
when you do like a brown smokey eye I
really like how the Naz foundation
caters to like so many different skin
tones like there's a lot of deep shades
in here a lot of light shades there's
like pink turns olive turns so that's
why I thought I should use this
foundation and because this is like the
only line of foundation that I have like
every shade so works out well my god my
lid space is so small like send help I
literally don't know what to do with my
eyebrows because Marsa these shades in
here I like warm turn so I'm gonna use
this one yeah and try and fill my brows
I don't know I don't know I'm gonna move
and it's gonna be so hard using a
foundation all these ones typical turn
this should work alright sir let's see
how these scars
oh no bad oh my go that's actually so
easy to apply it's definitely not the
color that I mean but it's okay
the only part you can really tell it to
the wrong shade is like at the top of my
brow here where I left drew drew a fake
icon because let's be real my browser
like slugs I mean if I had the choice to
our only foundation every day like Elise
you could do this instead of wearing
your makeup could you slow down for that
I mean sorry fall you never know how the
rest of vinegar now I'm going in with
what I used on my lid and I'm just gonna
run this underneath my lower lashline to
add some color they're using a mirror so
I don't know what's happening
Oh God oh just made me look like I had
bags okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and
add some falsies and I'll be right back
the lashes are on I feel like it looks
so much better now so next we're gonna
go in with a contour kind of shade so
this one is the Bobbi Brown stick
foundation in the shade a warm armand
6.5 i love using this to like bronze up
my face it looks incredible so i like to
go in on the back of my beauty blender
just so it doesn't like take off any
foundation on my face and then i'll just
pop this underneath my cheekbones just
here and everything's gonna look so
bronze ii and i like to blend it back
into my hairline as well okay
dramatic what a traumatic sometimes I
just wonder what's wrong with me but
every time I use my Beauty Blender
everyone's like it looks like giving in
fast motion Michael always takes the
piss out of me too it's so funny I'm
also gonna do my jawline under my chin
oh my god I really don't know what to do
for the blush look I'm stuck I just
don't think we can even do blush this is
like the pinkest foundation in the nas
um little set and it's just gonna
highlight my face like I don't know I
might just put this up here to highlight
because like what foundation has shimmer
net for starters okay I'm gonna use a
clean Beauty Blender I'll just blend
this out
I could highlight those cheekbones but
yeah I just repaint blushes even on the
agenda off for today's video at home
might take some of that underneath my
bronzing shade and just clean it up a
little bit well I guess I'm just gonna
go in with a nice lip color like a nice
nude I don't know what's gonna pop this
on my lips
maybe I'll go with a lot of shade nude
that's legit like send help
no you're like back when you're in high
school and you'd put foundation in your
lips like that's what's happening
maybe I'll go with like a deeper shade
or just so it's like a bit of a dark and
read on my lips I don't know feels
really nice on the lips I'll give it
that it feels like really hydrating
alright well I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did please give it a a
massive thumbs up I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in my next video
which won't be a weed one like see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
