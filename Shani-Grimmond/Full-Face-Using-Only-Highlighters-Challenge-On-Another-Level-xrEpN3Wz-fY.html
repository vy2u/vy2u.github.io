my channel so in today's video I'm doing
the full face of Harlow challenge I'm so
excited because I always go overboard
with my highlight anyway so in this
video I can really go overboard so
pretty much what it is is you put
highlight all over your face as much as
you can except obviously mascara and
lipstick and stuff like that so I'm
really gonna go overboard today I love
highlighter um so this isn't a serious
makeup tutorial anything it's just kind
of like playing around highlights and
just having a good time so I hope you
guys like this video I'm gonna leave the
main creator of this challenge in the
description box below because she's
beautiful and I think she started a
really cool fun video ideas so yeah
let's go ahead and jump into this video
I'm going to start by moisturizing my
face with a really thick moisturizer
just so all of the highlight really
sticks onto my face good to make this as
luminous as we can for the base I'm
going to take the foundation primer in
radiance by Laura Mercier and I'm just
going to put this all of my face and is
going to be a few steps to the base
because we need to be glowing from
within and without
next step is the Charlotte Tilbury one's
a glow this is also another like
luminous primer very shimmery it is so
gorgeous under foundation but I'm not
going to use foundation today just
because we are going only highlights
next step is the Josie Maran Argan
enlightenment illuminizer this stuff is
very shimmery so this is going to be
gorgeous let's do this oh my god yes so
if this brings out my pores
I'm just not gonna be happy really
really not gonna be happy I've literally
wanted to be this glow away my whole
entire life like I'm so happy right now
next step is the Mac lustre drops I've
never used this product before I'm
really excited to see how it goes oh it
looks pink though maybe I produce this
is blush I'll just start by putting on
my cheeks
yeah that's pink
they voted to put on my cheeks now for
highlight all over the face I'm taking
the artist Couture in the shade at
double take this is literally going to
take this to a whole nother level oh my
god guys literally this is so iridescent
it's like shining different colors in
different lights so I guess this can be
like to set all of the liquid
highlighters I really don't know how to
feel about this I look really like
purple I think this nicely the purple
shade have a little close up all my
pores are just out there to say hello
today next product I'm taking is the
betty lou manizer by the balm this is a
really dark shimmery bronzer I don't
know if this is actually I don't even
know if this is a highlighter or bronzer
but is it really really shimmery so I'm
just gonna put this wear out contour god
this is so pigmented I'm also gonna take
this around my forehead as well because
I like to be tan all the time what is
wrong with my mood today I'm such a
widow I actually really like this as a
bronzer might use it more often actually
contour my nose okay so if you guys
don't believe me on snapchat then you
wouldn't know what happened so basically
I bought this off a friend named jazz
she was like a makeup guru um located in
Australia as well and so she bought
double-up so I bought it off her
and it came perfectly fine but then I
opened it and played around with it had
a little swatch and then it fell like
five centimeters on the ground it
completely shattered into a hundred
pieces so I put I put lots of like
alcohol in it and tried to put it back
together it's still really powdery and
stuff but I messaged customer service
and since I didn't buy it I can't get a
new one but I don't know I feel like
this was one that had been dropped so it
was super delicate
and I just don't feel like it was
compacted down and off like it wasn't
tight we packed but still like Jeffrey
star he's amazing and this is such a
beautiful color I might just buy a new
one because to be honest I don't know if
I want to use this cracked one because
it's just so powdery let's do this yeah
I have to buy any one this is actually
such a nice color and these are sorry
pigmented as well well ELISA I feel is
bad wasting it now
okay here Elkin oh my god I haven't
tried this one yet so this is the pink
one called peach goddess I'm going to
put this on my cheeks as like a blush oh
my god this is ridiculous like look at
my face right now I love it I love it
and lastly of course I have to use the
shade ice cold by Jeffery star as well
it is like a stark white so if you have
really pale skin this would literally be
perfect for you let's just go one step
too far
whoa for the lid I'm going to take the
mary lou manizer by the balm this is one
of my favorite highlighters ever it's a
beautiful like pearly color so I'm just
going to pack this all over my lid now
taking the artist Couture cheek color
I'm just going to put this in my crease
it's a really really shimmery bronze
color this is going to be the first time
I've ever put a shimmery color in my
crease let's see what it looks like wow
pigmented
some reason I have this song everybody
makes mistakes everybody has those days
everybody knows what what I'm talking
about everybody pay out that way have
that stuck in my head for some reasons I
haven't watch Hannah Montana in the
longest time so I don't know where that
came from oh I just smiled I know what
lose massive like crack lines because if
it's so much like liquid product on my
face
then taking some of that crease shade
again I'm going to put this on my lower
lash line just to even out the eyeshadow
that's what you'd like to call it
I shouldn't okay so now it's time to add
a little sparkle to the brows so I'm
going to take my brow tint by astrology
and I'm just going to run this through
one bar at a time and then put a little
bit of glitter in there because why not
really an office is going to work but
while it's wet want to make sure the
glitter sticks I'm just going to do my
spoolie in my glitter oh my god I feel
like it's just gonna look fall all over
my face it did fall on my face but it
kind of fell on the highlighting parts
of my face do you know why I'm not even
mad oh my god with the fallout glitter
I'm just gonna kind of brush all in my
face so it's even this is not something
I usually do usually I brush it off but
let's just rub it in now it's time for
some mascara like this is the only part
I'm not gonna put shimmer because my
eyes are so sensitive time to pop on
some of my favorite lashes that these
are the huge Beauty lashes I'm gonna
leave the name of them down below
because I always forget but I did find
them on their site they're fucking
amazing I'm just gonna pop these on
the huge next step is to highlight my
inner corners I'm going to use ice
called by Jeffrey Stehr again and I'm
just gonna pop that right here you know
what I'm going to add a bit of brow bone
highlight as well cuz why not now taking
my NYX retractable lip pencil in the
shade nude this is amazing it's
virtually associate you guys you get it
I'm just gonna line my lips with this
push a little bit
and then I'm going to fill my lips in
with the maca lip gloss in the shade at
Le genius this has a lot of shimmers
throughout it so I thought it'd be
perfect wow that is really nice I really
see the shimmers oh so let me take a one
step further just with a little bit of
my Mac glitter gonna pop it right in the
center of my lips just kidding all my
lips and of course the last step is to
take my makeup chill setting spray in
cooling and hydrating just to make a
little bit more Joey so that we have the
finished look guys I really hope you
found this entertaining in some way I
definitely found it really fun so fYI I
