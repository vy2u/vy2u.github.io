my channel so in today's video I'm going
to be doing a full face of makeup using
only kids makeup this is going to be
interesting to say the least so I've
seen a bunch of other youtubers do this
no store it'll be super fun to do myself
so I will leave the original creator of
this video in the description below
because I think this is such a cool
video idea so for example this is what
some of the kids makeup looks like this
was like $15 I mean kinda pricey do you
think they're like a bronzer blush eye
shadow lipstick mascara all of that so
what I have no idea how this is going to
turn out and then we have some what
other things right here umm the
foundation I don't know if it is
actually kids makeup but it was $2.00
so for everything that I couldn't find
at kids makeup like in the kids section
I just went ahead to the really cheap
cheap cheap makeup so anything like
under 2 or $3 because I feel like that's
what you would buy a child just like
super cheap makeup unfortunately I
couldn't find any kids and makeup
brushes so I'm just gonna have to use
what I have here I literally looked
everywhere for the kids makeup brushes
but there were no where at all what are
we going to do with the I show today
these are all shimmery how am I gonna do
this okay I think I have a good idea I'm
going to start with the bronzer and I'm
going to use this as my transition shade
I don't have a primer for my eyes so
we're going to be able to see all of the
veins in my eyes which is gonna be
gorgeous
so let's start with your transition
shade this is just a gorge Brown we're
going to add some definition I mean this
looks pretty good it's showing up really
really well huh good start yours for the
next shade I'm gonna pick up this brown
color right here I'm just gonna put this
on the outer corner okay that did not
show up at all
yeah I'm gonna really have to swirl this
in here I'm actually going to take that
color and put this all over my lid so
I'm not too sure what else we can do
with these colors right here
ah I was rubbing that hard that I
cracked the eyeshadow in half with my
finger my bad okay so now it's time to
foundation I'm taking these two right
here in the shade a light and dark I'm
just going to go ahead and mix them
together now I'm going to go ahead and
stipple this onto my face that is so
thick oh my god this is literally the
thickest foundation I've ever tried in
my life mm-hmm Oh smells just costing I
don't have any concealer either so this
is gonna have to work as concealer when
I Pat this onto my face it feels sorry
sticky like my brushes literally
sticking to my face my whole brush is
just like dad it's gone it's gone I mean
the coverage is pretty good the color is
completely off I would say this is
definitely more of a pink base
foundation so we're gonna try and blend
this down my neck because my neck is
yellow because I do have yellow
undertones
now that we've evened out the skintone
I'm going to take the lighter Foundation
and use this as concealer under my eyes
I really wish that I had kids brushes I
feel like would be so much fun so I'm
just going to go ahead and Pat this
under my eye just like moving around
everywhere it's covering a little bit of
my purple bag so I feel like it's just
going to crease so bad because it's
really wet I'm actually really impressed
with how it's looking so far so let's go
ahead and set that foundation under my
eyes I'm taking the Lowell face powder
in zero-zero very light I got a really
light shade so I can highlight under
there let's see how this goes this was I
think this was $1 or $2 so cheap now I
don't even know how it's possible for
something to be true dollars because
you've got to make the packaging you've
got to make the product you've I don't
know so pigmented I Carney
like whoa I feel like it set my under
eyes really well it didn't grab to any
wrinkles under my eyes it's not a really
nice job at highlighting it feels
hydrating could you imagine if I felt
like a new Holy Grail product in this
video I'd be amazing I just realized I
don't have another powder this is only
one I have so we're not just set my
laugh lines just really lightly
otherwise it's going to go like right
there and then I'm gonna do a little bit
on my cheek bone so we can really blend
that bronzer don't know how I forgot
that okay so now it's time for bronzer
and I actually do have a kids brush for
this one and I mean this looks like
horsehair it's really stiff well this is
gonna be a disaster so I'm gonna go
ahead and use this runs the right here
which looks super dog brush is like rock
hard
oh my god okay let's do this
okay that's really pigmented once again
oh good I can hear it like scraping
against my skin this brush I'm trying to
pull in this up here a little bit it's
all way too much on just so we can have
a bit of a bronzey look today let's go
ahead and warm up the forehead as well
oh god I think because I didn't set my
face with powder it's literally just
like sticking to my face and it's just
like not blending around here we got
this girl we got this I don't think we
got this what is happening literally no
matter how hard I try this patchy area
up here is not unpacking so we're just
gonna have to leave it like this because
there's no way I can pick that that
sucks anyway so let's move on to blush
this is what it looks like I think it
looks really pretty I really like the
color I mean I feel like it's kid proof
to open it oh there we go I got it so
I'm going to use that same brush and
just apply this on the apples of my
cheeks right let's feel it again yes it
feels good a little bit powdery but
that's okay I feel like if I used a
different brush it might actually be
pretty decent because the color is
really nice to clean up all this
muddiness
under here I'm going to take that same
under eye setting powder and that's what
you want to call it and I'm just going
to do a little tiny bit of baking so I'm
just gonna like brush it down there see
if this makes it look any better
why is my foundation coming off there
happening I mean it's definitely making
it look a bit better I don't even know
how that bronze I got down this fur but
it did now it's time for highlighter I
could not find any highlighters at all
so I'm gonna mix it these two shades
right here that I show just fill in half
I mean mixed these two eye shows right
here as a highlighter my god look spooky
look ye when I'm finished with all this
makeup I'm gonna give it to my little
sister she is 9 I feel like she's gonna
love it if I ever go to her house and I
forget my makeup we all know what
highlighter I'm gonna use mm-hmm I just
can't stop I've been sitting you for
like five minutes applying this oh I
just look so good it actually does I'm
also going to take this highlight on top
of my eyebrows as well I want to make
that face look Chloe my chin on my nose
more and also on my Cupid's bow let's
move back onto the eye so I didn't
notice that this palette came with this
shitty-ass brush so I'm gonna try and
use this on my lower lash line it's so
what is coming out of it I mean I'm not
too sure if this is going to work
let's try I'm gonna take the bronzer and
just put this from inner corner to outer
corner
oh it's so fluffy
Bristol's a prick in my eyeball is so
doing the job they're now going in with
this highlight shade again on this firm
thing that it came with I'm just going
oh my god it's about to fall off
actually a basketball I'm really
impressed with these lighter shades in
this palette they actually look really
nice when you layer them up you just
have to be like uber patient with them
I'm also going to go ahead and highlight
under my eyebrow I don't know how I'm
gonna do this with this brush okay I'm
gonna put it on the side I really need
to get my eyebrows plucked can you see
how hairy they are it's like I'm
highlighting all the hair that's coming
out now going back into that bronzer and
blending out all that harshness that
we've got going on next we have a brown
eyeliner that came with that same
package so we're just going to go ahead
and line the waterline god I have really
sensitive eyes and it's just gonna make
it split painful ah it's so dry I was
gonna hurt it's not showing up at all
but no it's not working now it's time
for mascara let's see what the wand
looks like oh just a little too bad Pat
let's go ahead and coat the top and
bottom lashes when you think about it
there are all of the eyeshadows bronzers
and all that stuff that came the big
package when you divide all of that it's
literally like two dollars each so this
definitely is doing an amazing job for
two dollars everything so far has been
really good for the price it's working
really well on my lower lashes it's like
really really separating them I feel
like everyone that has done this
challenge has put on a pair of false
lashes I mean false lashes are the
exception even though they aren't kids
products he's gotta put lashes on a case
so I'll be right back now that the
lashes are on it's time to go ahead and
line your lash man with a bit of black
eyeliner let's do this
hahaha this is what it looks like let's
go ahead and give it a swatch oh wow
that is so black okay that's my just
really easy look I gotta be careful oh
my god this is so hard because this is
massive I'm just trying to go over the
lash band so we can change the color of
it just to make it black now it's time
for the eyebrows I'm gonna take this
little brow powder right here again this
one was two dollars I think um why does
it come with these for the eyebrows
how are you special I'm gonna try and
use this I'm just gonna dip it in on the
side
hurtful magic really what it's not even
like coming out what do you mean how are
you supposed to make a nose sharp tail
okay not happening I'm gonna go in with
my angled brush because literally it's
just not possible
it's just not possible at all so I'm
gonna make this nice and pointy all
right guys now it is time for the lips
we have two lip bullets right here let
me show you what they look like here are
the shades that we have to choose from
today the only lip liner it comes with
is a red a pinky red so what I think I'm
going to do is use this purple right
here and make like a red ombre kind of
lip so we're going to start with the red
lip liner and go ahead and learn my lips
well the colors definitely showing up it
feels like I'm rubbing an actual pencil
on my lips that's how hard it is but the
color is coming off which is all that
moves
okay now picking up this purple shade
let's lay this on well this is gonna
take forever Oh God
come on pigment where are ya it's not
getting any more pigment to look a dark
it is in there and then look at all my
blades mmm I'm going to use this clear
and glitter gloss just because the lips
already look absolutely disgusting I
mean this color is so sheer just looks
foul so I'm just gonna make it look even
worse we may as well so this is what it
looks like right here I'm just going to
glitter on em whoa I feel like this is
kind of cool but kind of tacky oh I
mean I'm not too happy about this lip
combination we have going on I'm going
to go ahead and take this off and try a
different gloss and just see if it looks
a little bit better I'm going to go
ahead and use this color all over my
lips I feel like this is a bit more
wearable a bit more shiny a pinky nude
color well okay this is what I'm talking
about I really really like this color
but yeah there we have the finished
makeup look if you guys enjoyed watching
it please give it a big thumbs up I had
so much fun at creating it and I'm just
doing the best mood now because it
actually turned out not that bad I
thought it was gonna be really bad what
was that I'm not too sure anyways I love
you guys so much
and I will see you in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
