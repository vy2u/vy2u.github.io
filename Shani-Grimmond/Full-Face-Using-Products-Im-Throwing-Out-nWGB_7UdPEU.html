channel sorry in today's video I'm doing
a full face of makeup using products
that I'm getting rid of I'm so proud of
myself for actually creating a tag that
everyone's now doing it's so cool so I'm
gonna be using just like heat some
makeup that I took out of my makeup
collection that I just don't really use
anymore and I'll tell you why I don't
use the products I always wonder from
write to you guys the best products that
I know of sir I feel like there's no
point keeping these long so I don't
really use and I don't really write so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video okay so we're gonna start with the
eyebrows I'm gonna use this NYX eyebrow
cake powder this one's in the shade dark
brown and I think I really use this once
on my channel and like that's the only
time that I used it so I feel like
that's just no point of me keeping it so
all these products that I burnt be
keeping I'll be giving away I'm not
throwing out unless it's off a really
disgusting and broken or something like
that so I'm gonna go in with the waxy
formula first and I'm just gonna like
put that through my brow so we have a
little bit of texture haven't even use
the wax in this I'm gonna go ahead and
take this lighter brown right here I'm
gonna start creating and I search in the
eyebrows I always do my eyebrows first
just so I can comp them out off to what
to make them look super defined every
time I feel needs videos I'm always like
why am I getting rid of these products
like some of them are actually really
good
I just need to venture out of it more
and use them I don't know if it's
because I use the wax but this is
working sorry well you know what there
it's definitely notice creamy as my
benefit eyebrow powder which is what I
always use oh my god I just primed my
eyes and my skin is that Drive it can
see all the flakiness here it's so
disgusting I need to do something about
my dehydrated skin right now I'm ready
for it but anyways let's go ahead and
move on to the eye shadow so I'm gonna
take the Too Faced and natural matte
palette so I'm sure you guys have seen
this floating around the internet before
or this has been out for so long and I
don't think I've used it since it came
out like it is a really nice palette it
has like all of the nice neutral shades
that you would ever need well kind
like for a basic look you know I mean
sir I don't know I just I haven't used
it
I have other eye shadows that are a
little bit more creamy and pigmented and
that just have like more of like
variation with colors so first color
that I'm gonna take is honey butter
which is this color right here which I
feel like is kind of the early
transition in the pellet so I'm really
gonna go in with this because it is
quite light and I'm just gonna pop this
in my crease
well my lids are so dry it's gonna look
disgusting for you guys that don't know
I'm actually in London right now
actually now I'm leaving today so if you
want to keep up with what I'm doing make
sure you head over to my instagram at
shiny crimin to see what me and Ronnie
do I'm so excited the next shade that
I'm gonna take is a shade strapless this
one too right here I actually really
really like that color I don't really
have too many shades like that sorry I'm
just gonna put this in my crease as well
I'm gonna blend this in win should wipe
immersions
I feel like I butch that one sorry bad
windshield wiper questions the formula
is really nice of this palette but I
just feel like I have other palettes
that are a little bit more pigmented so
like what's the point on using this one
if I have others that are better okay so
next I'm gonna take this color right
here and I'm just gonna put that a
little bit closer to my crease and a
lost call that we put down I feel like
these two are the only warm shades in
the palette so I have to now transition
to cool tone I'm just gonna pop this on
my outer crease and then my crease a
little bit
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and do a cut
crease so I'm just gonna take my top
shape tape conceal out of course I'm not
getting rid of this baby I love it so
much but I don't have a concealer that's
really gonna work to cut my crease that
I wanna get rid of so top crease is on
it let's go ahead and color it in so I'm
just gonna take the shade lace Teddy
it's just like a really nice light pink
shade I'm just gonna pop that all over
where that concealer is then of course
I'm just gonna go in with that darker
Brown again and I'm gonna use that to
blend the edges right here I'm really
trying my best to make this look good
but it just looks so chalky okay so the
next thing that I'm gonna get rid of is
this Urban Decay vice special effects
product here so I actually have the
Urban Decay heavy-metal glitter liner in
a shade distortion which is I'm pretty
sure the exact same thing as the product
in here except this one has like a
really thick or my god that is seriously
burning too much so I'm just gonna move
on to my face for the time being I'm
taking the elf hydrating face primer and
the reason why I don't like this is just
cuz I feel like it makes my foundation
kind of like slip around like it's a
really wet like slimy consistency and
when it comes to like skincare and stuff
I really like to put in that extra
dollar because obviously my skin is so
important to me so I want to make sure
my skin is well looked after but I
obviously understand not everyone can do
that but this is just like my personal
preference
the next thing that I have right here is
the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour
foundation this one's in the shade
medium 10 honey I just think this
foundation is a far too thick for me I
know you'll see how it applies the last
time I used it I don't recall hating it
I just have a lot of other foundations
that I'm like obsessed with and I never
touch this on the colors are either
I don't know I just prefer like more
liquidy kind of foundations then really
thick ones I'm gonna have to go in with
my Beauty Blender and Pat over this
foundation because the brush is leaving
little marks on my face it's not really
leaving the best coverage either oh this
is just picking the product oh I
honestly just use very much of that
foundation but there's like hardly any
coverage like I can see all over my
freckles on my nose all my breakouts you
can still say like wow I'm gonna go
ahead and finish my eyes because
honestly it's annoying me so much
looking at it it looks disgusting sorry
I'm taking the party cosmetics the white
night mascara and there's a lengthening
brush and a volume brush and honestly
I've never even used this product before
I was just like in my cupboard for so
long so I guess I'm gonna go into town I
just feel like if I have too much makeup
I just get really overwhelmed so I like
to keep like a small amount but enough
to like show you guys different products
or no I never picked this one out I've
never even heard of this brand okay not
gonna lie I actually really like this
mascara I'm keeping this one oh well I'm
sitting here listening to old music
which I love doing by the way
I just put my fern down in my room that
was first with my eyeshadow one I made
my eyelashes on with anyway speaking all
false lashes I'm gonna go in with these
ones from a herd of beauty these ones
are in the style of Sasha eleven this is
what they look like right here I just
don't really like that plastic you look
I just prefer like really fluffy ones so
I'm gonna go ahead and pop these on I'm
just gonna put it as close as I can to
my lash line oh my god it's like so
stiff ridi ridi does have some of my
fave lashes and I think I have any on
the other fluffy ones left honestly they
were the hardest lashes I've ever had to
put on because the band is so thick so
we're just gonna work with what we have
right now it's not really sticking to my
to my eyes that it's just not working
anyways I'm gonna go in with this a
pixie illuminating tin and conceal so
this one is a tinted moisturizer and
concealer
on the end oh right here so I've never
used some before I just don't think I
would like it because obviously it's
gonna be super thick because it's in
like a condensed like stick formula kind
of thing I don't know I just don't ever
Lane for these tablets concealer so I'm
just gonna put this underneath my eyes
and first impression it is super dry oh
and please keep in mind that I do love
all of these brands that I'm using like
they have some bone products like every
single brand that I've literally used I
thought obviously some products just
start wet for me sorry I'm just I'm
gonna be honest if they don't work for
you no I really like the color of this
concealer mmm no no no that is so thick
that's not even really blending like at
all and it's sorry dry I feel like this
is turning into a products I hate video
like I genuinely tried so hard to make
this work like I tried to do a cut
crease with like glitter on the lid but
it just didn't work for me so I'm going
to take that concealer and put that down
my nose oh my God my whole nose is like
out the freckles are out to play today
so we're just gonna blend this in looks
like snakeskin
the next product I'm getting rid of is
the Kat Von D at setting powder this is
in the shade translucent so I have been
using this for a while and I was kind of
like always confused if I liked it or
not because sometimes it would take my
concealer completely off and other times
it was fine sorry I just don't think
it's worth like risking having a
horrible makeup depending on like what
concealer I use cuz I really don't know
why it does that sort I'm just gonna
give this one away so I'm gonna pack
this underneath my eyes I just really
prefer the translucent powders that like
melt into the skin and this one doesn't
oh no I don't like this one was a big
hit for many people oh oh
then for the rest of my face I'm taking
the it cosmetics your skin but better CC
plus airbrush perfecting powder this one
has the SPF 50 in it and that's just not
something that I want because if I'm
gonna put sunscreen on I'm just gonna
put it underneath all of my foundation
stuff because you get flashback sorry I
would never use this at nighttime that's
usually the majority of the time where I
do my makeup like I don't need sunscreen
in my pad I'm sorry I thought I would
just get rid of this one is pretty light
as well wait can I ask you a question
nari but I have a question do you think
my cuts okay yeah that's your line oh my
god my phone died I was trying to see if
he was like I was gonna see if it's
gonna be honest with me because it looks
sorry bad yeah it's definitely it's
definitely on the foundation and
concealer let's go in oh girl let's go
ahead and line the lower lash line I'm
just gonna take well with a shudder I'm
just gonna take that dark brown shade
and I'm gonna put this right under here
nothing dramatic all the concealer is
like lifting and that pad I made that
concealer even worse as you can see
right here there's like a line of
concealer here and then the powder took
all the product off here the next thing
that I'm getting rid of is something
that I thought was like really cool when
I bought it but I was like why did I
waste $30 on this it is from lipstick
Queen and it's like a lipstick that is
like a wave color I have like green grey
and it turns pink once you put it on so
it's just like a lip balm but I'll
actually make sure
don't ink and so you can already see
it's going pink but I genuinely cannot
stand having pink lips like I think it
looks so gross on me I like having my
foundation like I met my lips like
blocked out with a nude over the top
otherwise I like to go with like a baby
pink lip balm but this is just like it's
like I've just had like an ice block
that's pink oh and it smells gross oh
it's a dry patch rash the next thing
that I have right here that I don't
really want anymore is the taut Park
Avenue princess chisel pellets so the
only reason why I don't want this
anymore is because I have so many
pellets like this that have all of these
shades pretty much in it like I have the
contour palette from Tarte and that's
like all of these shades and I don't
really use like lighter shades at all so
I just don't feel like I need this
palette at all and they are pretty good
so I feel like someone else will like
appreciate it a lot more so I'm just
gonna go in with the shade angle pose
shook for a second because I'm like am I
reading angel wrong but it generally
says angle wow that's beautiful
okay well I'm just gonna put this under
my cheekbones and runs out my face a bit
I don't think my laugh lines have ever
been this bad from the foundation that
I'm using holy crap I'm also going to
take the shade a crown which is a darker
Brown actually I think that might be a
little bit too dark for me I might take
the shade carrot which is this one right
here all these names are so weird what
the hell okay so I'm just gonna dust a
bigger fluffier brush on this color
right here if you do have deeper skin
tone off like this would be so pretty
what Oh for me I think this one should
be okay I'm gonna go in oh my god it
went everywhere I'm gonna go back in
with my Kat Von D powder and I'm just
gonna bake underneath that bronzer
just so we can clean it up a little bit
I'm gonna go guys by the way my name
Michaels Murch drops tomorrow at 12
o'clock recent I'm excited I'm gonna go
in with a chi chi the Immaculate on
bright blush collection I just think
this is white peeping for my liking and
all the shades are kind of similar so I
just don't see the boobs I'm gonna take
this one here cuz that's like my
favorite color out of there these two
are probably the only true that I like
genuinely like oh my god I keep saying
genuinely it's freaking annoying me when
I put this on the apples of my cheeks
and blend it back oh geez girl relax oh
my gosh the next thing that I have here
is a jeffree star cosmetics skin frost
in the shade ice cold
I have all of the shades from Jeffrey so
I think it did have all the shades I
think I dropped them and they shattered
but I just don't like how the texture is
so chunky and thick it kind of makes the
skin look a little bit textured and on
top of that this highlight is not my
color
it's far too light for my skin tone so
I'm just gonna give this to someone that
has a lot of skin turn the mean maybe
they'll like it if they like really
really dramatic mmm highlights I haven't
used this one in ages actually like
maybe it's not too thick that's just
what I remember thinking
yeah definitely it wasn't wrong I'm just
gonna try to get but be light off yeah
that's better you have to have a very
light hand the next thing that we have
right here is from a Fenty beauty it is
a lipstick in the shade Vampira of any
of these lipstick lipsticks I was just
going through like a bunch of them and
this is just like one color that I don't
think would really suit me but some of
the other colors look amazing so I'm
just gonna give this to someone that
like you know likes a dark kind of rosy
pink color so it's going with this
oh it's sorry pigmented holy crap well
let's just say that this lipstick
formula is incredible I can't wait to
try the other colors it actually doesn't
look that bad this color but it's not
something that I would I know I wouldn't
wear this I'm like in like my times
there's no point really keeping it the
next thing I have right here is from tot
it is the lip bling in the shade heist
and it's just like a glittery um like
rosy color like rosy champagne like lip
top and it's just like really shimmery I
don't know I just I don't ever wear this
kind of stuff it looks really pretty
there I'm just gonna put it over the top
of this see what it looks like
I think if you put it over in MATLAB it
would look a lot more glittery but this
one's kind of just like blended in with
the lipstick and it looks pretty good
actually it just looks like a gloss the
last thing that I have right here is
from Scandinavia it is the post and make
up recovery spray now this one isn't bad
at all I'm pretty sure this is like men
the same company as the Urban Decay
makeup setting sprays and they're like
my all-time favorite settings phrase but
oh my god sometimes lipstick makes
Victoria tickle please tell me I'm not
the only person that happens to oh yeah
so the only reason why I'm gonna give
this one away is because it kind of has
like a weed scent to it like let's just
say oh wait that doesn't even smell well
there you go
um that one doesn't smell I must have
already thrown out the other one that
smell and maybe I got a bad batch with
something but that's actually really
good
I love the spritzer in that the other
one that I had smell like cigarette and
I'm pretty sure it was like purple
packaging so I think I've ever done but
anyways guys here we have the finished
makeup look I honestly think this was
like one of the biggest disasters I've
ever filmed on my channel like it
doesn't look too bad when I'm looking at
on the viewfinder but yeah it's
definitely it's definitely really bad
but anyways if you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a massive thumbs up
and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel so you don't miss out on any
future videos I love you guys so so much
and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
