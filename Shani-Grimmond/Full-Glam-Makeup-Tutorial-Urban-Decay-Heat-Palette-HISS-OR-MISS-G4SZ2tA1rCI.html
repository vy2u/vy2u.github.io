today's video I'm going to be playing
with the Urban Decay and naked heat
pallet eye and so freaking it crowded
with this because well I mean everyone
saying that it's really good so let's
put it to the test because I hated the
other Naked palette start and I did get
the Naked 3 palette and it was just
horrible pigmentation so I'm really
hoping that this is incredible and then
I'm gonna try it some other new things
as well so let's go ahead and do this I
really want to do a dramatic but
obviously we're working with warm turns
so it's going to be like not the same
old but like same times you know
everyone loves long turns anyway like we
can't complain with this color selection
I'm really sorry if you can hear banging
out there it's so annoying but there's
like so much construction I'm moving in
three months again because it's so
annoying like shut up anyways let's move
on to the eyebrows so I'm going to take
the amela cosmetics brow pomade this
one's in the shade caramel I'm not just
keen to turn your products today so I
already have my normal eyebrow brush and
we can use this random one that I found
this one from makeup weapon which is
like an angled brush and we're going to
fill in my brows this is such a dark
color at this place I'm thinking of
going in to get my brows tatted on again
I got them done like a years or maybe
even three years ago and like it's
pretty much just like falling off and
that's a given like you have to get them
refilled anyway but I just can't be
bothered so I'll take weight off but I
really wanna get them done again because
I want to have my arch back and have
more shape into my brows I'm going to
called mark and then I'm going to carve
my brows outward there's a Becca aqua
luminous prospecting concealer I've only
just once and I really liked it so let's
try it again this is an attender spare
i'm using the morphe and four three two
to do this it's just adds so much shape
I love it and of course once I have a
carved into my brows I'm just going to
put a little bit concealer on my lid to
make sure there's no veins peeking
through any discoloration okely-dokely
the first color that I'm going to take
from the palette is a low blow this is a
warm at Sandy Brown this is going to be
perfect for the crease I'm so excited to
see if these a really buttery honestly I
don't know what to
expect alerts coming to their closer Wow
that's pigmented girl I mean I wouldn't
say it as a buttery as like Rue de
Beauty there's elections down my
favorite eye shows in the world but
these are still incredible look very
right up there in my books I think and
next I'm going to take the shade here
devil right here this one's a beautiful
mover any warm brown oh I love these
earthy tones do what is that alright so
I'm just going to take this on a
bdellium tools 776 brush and I'm hoping
this right in my crease all my goodness
that formula says oh wow so I'm just
going to blows from outer corner all the
way to inner corner I feel like I
haven't really been on my youtube
channel as much as I'd like to recently
because I've been just I don't know I've
just been hanging out my friends like a
lot more than usual it's made me so
happy but I still miss like feeling the
time of the year so I really need to
like learn how to balance out the truth
you think it's because like I'm at that
stage in my life where I finally like
know what I want to do for the rest of
my life and like I know I just feel very
fulfilled that color was sort of
hot I'm actually dying like that was
crazy so under that so nicely - I love
doing really matte eye shadow look
sometimes it just looks so good so I'm
going to take oh god I went to take this
color down here it's just a dark version
of this one it's like a really nice
tomorrow in color and I'm going to pack
this all over my lid
oh that's sort of pigment to them surely
dying like what do you mean and then
with that light and maroon color I'm
gonna go back into the crease to blend
out any edges I want it to go from a
darkest on the lid to later oh my god it
actually looks like I've been punched in
the eye right now we go fix that later
with some big lashes but for the primer
I'm going to take the makeup forever
hydrating a primer I've had this lip so
long and I never use it but because I do
have dry skin it's like perfect primer
to me so I'm Brit heaps on my face I'm
just going to go into
town I feel sorry ice on my skin now
it's time for the foundation sorry I've
been obsessing this line at for the
longest time you guys know this I've
talked about it so much recently it is
the true face of Born This Way a
foundation I have the shade I literally
have like nearly every shade but I'm
going to show you that warm new today
because May 10 is fading a little bit
but they are coming out with six new
shades very soon so I mean there's much
shade for everyone because 24 shades all
up yes Terry are to apply that I'm just
going to use this and makeup geek face
of buffer brush I'm going to put a few
pumps on the back of my hand and I'm
going to build this up full coverage
today you can really you can get it from
local medium to full coverage but I want
that all lamb today honey
it feels really light on the skin as
well it's oil free it has so many like
amazing ingredients in there to
replenish your skin and make it nice and
hydrated so the new six shades are
coming out on to face calm on June 15 so
that is now so don't go get them and
then they're coming in stores and online
at Mecca on August the 29th so I am
working with Too Faced on this video and
a few of my other ones as well but
before I was even like sponsored by them
or anything I went through three born sa
foundations over a couple of years
because that's how obsessed I was with
it like it was the only foundation that
I was really using it makes my personal
life because like on YouTube I always
change on my foundations but that was
just what I was like digging and I
completely forgot about it and I was
like oh my god it's amazing like what do
you mean
well the concealer I'm going to use the
same one that I used on my lids at the
Becca bonzela let's hide these dark
circles under here and because the
eyeshadow look is very like purple turn
on and make sure right under here is
completely like brightened up I'm just
going to blend this in with my Beauty
Blender
as you do it up and then to sit
underneath my eyes I'm taking the Rimmel
match perfection silky loose face powder
I always use the same one this one is
very affordable and it's really good so
the first thing that I always do before
I bake is just pop any loans away
because we don't need that and then I'll
just pop the translucent powder over the
top and then to the rest of my face I
taking the Australis a fresh and
flawless that pressed powder and shade a
medium tan I used to use this all the
time I loved it so much it just makes my
skin very matte no matter what
foundation you have it will mattify it
completely and recently I've been
laughing like a little glow but I mean I
love it still so alright so it is time
for the lower lash line so I'm going in
with that dark maroon color again and
I'm taking that from an outer point the
inner corner really going to milk it out
you can nice and dark because I haven't
done like a really dark smoky eye in so
long I'm going to go all that today and
keep the eyes a really smoky so I'm
going to go in with the Achilles smudge
stick a waterproof eyeliner in the shade
oh my god this liquid makeup all over
it's in the shade at stingrays just a
jet black color and this is so good it
lasts ages in the waterline so let's do
this I have a little chunk of glitter in
my eye pal can you guys see that
Selene wing and while I'm there I'm just
going to go in with the Kat Von D tattoo
liner and just line my upper lash lines
to the lash band so it's not visible at
all and then to mascara I'm going in
with the Urban Decay perversion mascara
I feel like this one's getting really
really old yeah it smells really bad I
hope it's not off I'm just going to coat
my top and bottom lashes so we can be
ready for Soltys I'm so excited to meet
onto the face and just make my face
sorry bronzy no it's time to the falsies
so I'm going in with the Lily lashes in
the shade oh my god buy in this style
goddess these ones are so pretty they're
not like to speak I'll show you what
they look like but they're still nice
and long and wispy so you can still see
the eye shadow like in between all the
cracks if you know what I mean and my
eye shape like it's what it so I kind of
need that so I just have my jewelry glue
where is it oh I put it back so it's not
a problem
it is the doer strip lash adhesive this
is one that I use all the time I've let
that dry for about a minute and now I'm
going to go ahead and put my lashes on
make sure that they're fluff on the lash
band because that's when gets real
bad honestly looking down and placing it
all nerd bye bye bye bye I feel on them
no time to contour the face I'm taking
the benefit hoola bronzer yeah by
benefit I'll just say that again okay
and I'm also using that with the multi
a Wi-Fi brush I'm just going to place
this all right underneath my cheekbones
dull really make them stand out a bit
more and then for more of a glow I'll
take the Terracotta but runs up by two
you go on yeah we cured Ellen and then
the brush is the Inglot 36b GS that was
like do they really have to make that
long it's really not necessary okay
let's do this
I love adding a bronze to the skin it
just makes everything look so much
better
it sounds like tiny little specks of
shimmer in here it's really pretty and
of course I'm just going to bake with my
Rimmel powder again I'm just going to
leave it on so literally one second and
then take it off and now for the black
shot I'm going in with this liner from a
covergirl it is called a classic color
590 there we go I love this one so much
it's a really nice corally pink shade
and it has lots of shimmers in it which
I love I love really like pretty glowy
cheeks so pretty and of course I go with
highlighters it up anyway today whatever
highlights hello okay so the highlight
I'm wearing it today is from Physicians
Formula I think I've use this once or
twice in a video but I want to try it
out again because I know that I forget I
said that what it looks like oh my god
but studying like a staple like
champagne shade gorgeous I've been
really feeling like the gold highlights
lately but still love this I loved how
the formula of this is so finely milled
though just like sinks into the skin
instead of looking really powdery on top
of the skin let's just go dramatic on
the lips as well why not so I'm going to
take the Urban Decay 24-hour glide on
lip pencil in a shade of black Mouse's
AF beautiful deep purple color and I
think it'll be perfect for the lid like
looks maximal lips L and then to fill
that in I'm going in with the Milani
amore matte lip cream in the shade 18
this one's so pretty
and obviously affordable as well I don't
think I used to do oh it smells amazing
okay so we're having a little bit of
troubles with that Milani product it's
really patchy and it's just crumbling on
my teeth so definitely definitely not
using that oh my god my lips are so
staying right now
is literally like my natural lip collet
because other same okay so instead I'm
going to go in would be a morphia liquid
lipstick in the shade this is a very
similar color let's see how this formula
is on this one
oh here's like a little brown in purple
and then over the top I'm taking the Mac
huggable glass in the shade mega hug
this is going to make it a little tiny
bit lighter and a super glossy so it's
cruisers oh it's really make it that
closer you what lastly I'm going to go
in and set my face with the Romola
insta-fix and go setting spray let's do
this so here we have the finished makeup
look I'm a MC skat and lip gloss pretty
on my teeth already yes oh it was so
much fun doing something really dramatic
and find it so I hope you guys have an
amazing day and I'll see you in my next
video good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
