and welcome back to my channel so in
today's video I'm doing a get ready with
me for a date night so I have a few
ideas in mind but other than that I
don't know what we're doing so let's
jump straight into the video I did my
brows off camera because I feel like
that's kind of boring to watch but let
me know in the comments below if you do
want to see me do my brows so boring so
now let's move on to the eyes so I'm
starting with the mac prolongwear
concealer i have the shade NC 20 so i'm
just going to go ahead and conceal my
lid i really like this for an iPad now
because it is so thick so it's really
going to cover all of these veins on the
eyelid and of course setting that
concealer in place with a powder you
guys know the drill I've literally done
this a thousand times now going in with
the Smashbox photo Matt eyes palette it
looks like this the colors are so
buttery when I swatch them so I'm really
sad to see how they go the first color
that I'm going to take is this cool tone
Brown right here and this is just going
to go in the crease I haven't done a
cool shadow look in the longest time so
let's see how this looks so just popping
this in my crease as a transition I'm
just going to blow it up a little bit
this brush is honestly incredible for
blending products in the crease it is
the 2 to 8 luxe crease by Zoe you guys
need to get it and also this top is
amazing I need to show you guys right
now it is a top from end code I'm going
to be showing you guys some more outfits
at the end with more anchor clothes but
I just had to quickly show you guys the
top because I have never been so
obsessed with the top in my life I love
this little like droopy bit right here
well or dressy I'm actually really
impressed with these eyeshadows they're
blending just as well as my favorites
which is the makeup geek eyeshadows so
that's always a good start now going in
with this nice chocolate brown here this
is going directly in the crease and also
on the outer corner so I'm just going to
take this
a smaller blending brush oh my god these
shutters are freakin amazing
I'm just going to put this on the outer
corner
let's nice and pigmented and then blend
that upwards and into my crease going
back in with my blending brush as you
can see right here there's a bit of a
sharp line so I'm just going to lightly
take my brush around the edges and buff
it out now I'm going to take the a
violet Voss glitter glue and I'm
actually in a line eyeshadow over the
top of this but I really want the eye
show to be like really pigmented so I'm
just going to go ahead and paint this on
the inner half of my eyelid probably
should go with the brush but I can't
involve and then taking this and
moondust palette from Urban Decay I'm
going to take this shade right here and
put that all over the lid oh my god I
just made it so pigmented I'm done now
going in with the black from this same
Smashbox palette I'm just going to Pat
this on the outer corner but very very
lightly I just want a tiny bit more
darkness there I'm just going to fade it
over the glitter and again just giving
this a quick blend around the edges now
I'm going in with this nude by Nature
airbrush mineral primer I'm just going
to put a few squirts on my face and then
blend it in with this synthetic brush
what's it smell like oh not a fan of
nude by Nature smell I really need to
like remove this camera angle up because
it looks like I have nori hair now going
in with the dual air flash foundation I
haven't used this in so long I'm just
going to spray it directly on my brush
because it gets a bit messy
 no that was so cold oh my god
this foundation has a really nice like
natural but full coverage finish that's
how you describe it it's not like cakey
at all it just it's so nice on the skin
now I'm taking the instant age rewind i
maybelline and I'm just going to use
this to conceal into my eyes this is
nearly empty what I think it is empty
this is so sad yeah I'm just going to
blend this in with a Beauty Blender I've
got a brand new one which I'm so happy
about now going in with the makeup
studio translucent powder in extra fine
I'm going to use this to bake or got
annoying everywhere using that same
Beauty Blender I'm just going to pack
this under my eyes you know what it
smells exactly like baby powder and I'm
inhaling in it's not fun now taking my
hello flawless powder by benefit in the
shade honey I use the same powers all
the time so if you guys know of any good
ones please let me know in the comments
but I like this one cause it adds a bit
of extra coverage now going in with that
same dark crease color this is going on
the lower lash line so I'm taking this
from oh my god I need to wash this bag
of like what I mean someone just turned
their base on and I can hear it like
it's in my lounge room about to go bang
on the walls literally now going in with
that same lid color I'm going to put
this on my lower lash line focusing it
in the middle now this will be the test
if it's actually as pigmented as that
like without the glitter eye without the
glitter glue but I doubt it
it's actually really nice though because
I don't want to your opaque just like a
nice dusty litter look now I'm just
gonna take some glitter glue again this
stuff comes in handy all the time I'm
just gonna pop this on my inner corner
because I want a really intense inner
corner highlight since this is very dark
I just have testing did you hear that
it's a little double here and then I'm
gonna take my artist Couture highlight
in the shade of Coco bling I'm just
going to use whatever's in the lid oh my
god it's going everywhere stop it we're
gods
stunning to finish off the eyes I'm
going to go in with this matte white
shade and this is going to be my
highlight shade so just putting this
hmmm moving this under my eyebrow
probably need a smaller brush let's be
real we already have a nice highlight
going on under the eyebrow anyway from
the concealer so it's not that crucial
to do this step I feel and then for
mascara I'm taking the driver need to
say it I use this in like every video so
Urban Decay oh my god did I just say
that the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and
of course not forgetting at my lower
lashes I just put on some of these
lashes I think the brand is called
bespoke but this is what they look like
for bronzer today I'm going in with the
hoola benefit this is my all-time
favorite I'm just going to take that in
a little angled brush and put this under
my cheekbones
then with whatever is left on the brush
I'm just going to take this down my nose
now to bronze up my skin I'm taking the
Mac give me Sun I haven't used this one
in so long it's probably been two videos
I don't know but I love this stuff so
much just for an icicle lo here I'm just
putting this under my cheekbones and
also around my forehead as well now for
my blush I'm taking the urban decay
afterglow blush in the shade video I've
had this for so long but I don't think
I've actually ever used it it's just one
of those shades that matches any makeup
look I'm just going to put this on the
apples of my cheeks and then blend it
back next step is highlighter I'm taking
this Laura Mercier highlighter in the
shade indiscretion I haven't used this
in so long and look how pretty it is so
I just sprayed my brush with mac fix+
now I'm just gonna put this on my cheeks
now for the lips I'm taking the chichi
lip liner in the shade centerfolds oh my
god I feel like I have this and I just
bought it the other day damn it
and to finish off the lips I'm going in
with this gloss from Kylie cosmetics
this is in the shade it's so cute it's
my favorite products from her line it's
like a really nice light nude it's on
it's so I pack so you honestly like
don't need anything under it which is
amazing
