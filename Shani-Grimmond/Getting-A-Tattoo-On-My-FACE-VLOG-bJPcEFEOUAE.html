eyebrow eyebrows tattooed on again I
thought I'm done like I think a year ago
with something and a lot of the ink has
fallen out so I'm just getting a bit of
a refill I'm so excited because the
shape of my brows have completely just
like falling off the face of this earth
like that completely uneven again and
I'm over it
I don't hate filling my brows and I
honestly hate it sir this is like a good
thing to me I just get the head read on
and then you don't really have to fill
them in like the only time I filled them
in was to make them a little bit too off
and they looked amazing last time so I'm
very excited I'm going back to the same
place because I trust her I don't want
to with anyone new I'll let you
guys know how we got this is the before
barring an average Jerry for house you
know I like my little chicken so I just
got my eyeball I just my eyebrows
tattooed on
they're looking very nice I'm very happy
with them it took like I think like an
hour and it had a lot more this time
than last time just because when you go
over again it's like you're going over
those skin that's already been ripped
open so it hurts even more but yeah it
wasn't too bad so yeah I'm really happy
with them constant looking at them but I
need to stop looking there visionary man
 running someone's off right now
I'm just going so bitsy canary Mary Mary
I'm just gonna get my nails done because
one fell off and you know if that's what
problems what can you get a mani-pedi
and I need to get a clothesline
today it's all about like adult jokes
isn't it you need a clothesline because
I've got a breach because I was hanging
my clothes out on the table outside like
what do you mean
you said what adults do oh sure you guys
what my rounds with black dog when I get
hurt that's closed up
studying orange light oh you look so
happy
Wow okay sir I'm finally back home man

outside this day has been interesting
everyone on the road today was driving
like a literal idiots like I couldn't
deal with it I had so much anxiety when
I was driving today
what soft spot this is what my nails
look like I got like a one shade lighter
but I feel so much better than I'd done
and let's have a little closer like my
brows we got a nice high arch it touches
my freckle so I'm gonna get a refill in
about two six weeks
sorry yeah they're gonna fade it a
little bit thirst then I'm gonna read
this stuff so much more shape to them
you all have that one good brow this one
looks so much better so basically what
she did was like oh I think this is what
she does I think she just like it's a
blade and slices and puts like color in
there I mean I'm sure it's small a bit
more technical than that but that's what
it feels like when she slices the skin
and you can hear it written I'm like oh
