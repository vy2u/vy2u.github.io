like literally a cowgirl outfit it's the
only splendid thing that I really have I
just went shopping and go to the up
today so I was gonna wear like a maxi
dress but I feel like it's too dressy
the slender so I just chucked it on all
my god my brows out that whole time so
sorry yeah
now I mean Jonathan are starting to
drink so come drink with us good
that Street is it's literally like like
two o'clock with something and we
haven't even left yet but I just want to
make sure that I'm really drunk before I
go I don't want to go so but that's just
boring you guys have never really seen
me like drinking of work this is going
to be interesting let's do it we are
will link to the bus now to get I look
like I'm not feeling really nice see

coracle great you only just fat don't
say that
good morning guys so it is day two of
slender and today is going to be so much
better than yesterday so basically what
happened is something really bad made me
feel like shit so I ended up going home
really early um so someone that I was
really really really close friends with
put up snapchats of her friend mocking
me so like hey guys welcome back to my
channel like I'm YouTube famous here's
my coupon code for the past because I'm
getting a bus to slender and just being
the biggest asshole and this person that
I was really close friends with was like
laughing at her and everything I'm like
condoning her like putting it on her own
snapchat it made me so angry because I
don't think you should be friends with
people that make you feel like shit
about yourself or about what you do I
was just like so shocked and like I know
I just couldn't get my mood back up
again but that's done I don't have time
for that in my life anymore yeah this is
my outfit today it is just like a really
long maxi dress I had to put little
Hollywood take here so my nipples are a
pop out but yeah putting a bail gone in
a bag and boots and stuff to like kinda
dress it down anywho we are off to get
our breakfast now

hungry I feel sick because in that
hungry I do
