hope you've been liking how much I've
been uploading lately I feel like I've
been on a roll with videos so in today's
video I'm doing a first impression on
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation so basically what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to apply it tell you
what I think of it from my first
impression and then I'm going to leave
it on all day and give you guys a review
on how it's holding up on my skin it is
96 dollars or something or 92 dollars in
Australia so it's really expensive and
then it's like 66 dollars in America so
I thought it'd be kind of a good thing
to do our first impression on this or
like a review just because it is so
expensive and I want to make sure that
people are getting what they paid for so
I have heard a lot of really good things
about this the packaging is really nice
I love just sleep packaging and I am in
the shade at 6.5 so hopefully this
matches because I did buy it on line so
I'm just going to have a look on the
website and see what this foundation is
all about it says silky lightweight
fluid foundation for seamless
application capture the glow of a
perfect looking skin with luminous look
foundation and oil-free hydrating fluid
with exclusive micro filter key so it
does sound like something I would like
because I do like that luminous glow to
the skin because I do have kind of dry
skin so yeah what I'm going to do is
spray half my face with a primer to see
if the primer helps with my longevity so
I'm going to cover like half my face and
spray it on I feel like this is also
going to test the primer that I'm using
as well to see if that actually works
it is the Smashbox photo finish primer
water I have you so much of this and I
just love the way that it feels in my
face when I spray it but I don't know if
it actually works
like my foundation and usually stays on
all the time pretty well so we'll see ok
so just going to shape the bottle a
little bit and then I'm going to put a
few pumps on the back of my hand I do
love that it has a pump as well so the
consistency is quite runny and the color
looks like it's going to match me so I'm
going to apply it with a damp Beauty
Blender I always make sure that I run it
then tickle in my throat I always make
sure I run it under cold water before I
use it just cause it gets nice and fat
and it doesn't
as much foundation so this is the
biggest man I've got favorite eyeshadow
palette by the way and I'm just going to
start working this into my skin the
color seems to be matching pretty well
so that's this side done I am going to
have to use a few more pumps on the
other side because two pumps didn't
really go a very long way so as you can
see right here it does a pretty good job
at coloring but I wouldn't say that it's
a full coverage I definitely think you
could build it up to a full coverage
though so I do think the color is
probably one or two shades too dark for
my skin so what I'm going to do is blend
a bit of bronzer down my neck just so it
matches I'm just going to go ahead and
finish the rest of my makeup and then
tell you what I think of it and if it
blends in with my powder and concealer
and all of that so I'll be back in a
second okay so I just finished my makeup
and it did build up to a really full
coverage with all of my concealer and
pattern all about over the top so I
would say right now that is a full
coverage and it has covered all of my
blemishes and all of my redness and
everything like that it's just done a
really good job actually um it didn't
have like a luminous finish though I did
find that it had quite a matte finish so
I put a cream blush on and a bit of
highlighter to make it look like a lip
to make it look a bit more healthy
because it was a really really matte and
it looked a bit flat um but I do like
having cream products in my face anyway
so that doesn't really bother me just
add a bit more like healthy glow to the
skin so yeah so far so good
I'm going to come back in a few hours
and tell you guys what I think hopefully
it lasts throughout the day hopefully it
doesn't crease around my laugh lines it
hasn't yet so I'm very impressed
I'll see you guys soon okay so it's been
about three hours now this is usually
when my foundation starts to kind of
look a bit different on my face like
with other foundations that I use
sometimes it starts to get oily or my
creases right here start to get pretty
bad so if I haven't looked at my
foundation yet the let's have a look-see
Oh everything is actually pretty much in
place how it was before so nothing's
changed which is really really good
there is a tiny bit of creasing right
here but all I'd have to do is get a
brush and wiggle
away let's do that there we go so it's
good as new it literally looks the exact
same as to how I put it on at the
Saturday so so far I'm actually quite
impressed and I'm not feeling too bad
about spending sixty six dollars us for
a foundation okay so as you can see
right now I'm in my pajamas and I'm
ready to take my makeup off I don't
really like having my makeup on for too
long just because the eyelashes irritate
me and the band is just like itchy on my
eyeballs I don't know why but yeah I'm
ready to wash my makeup off so this
foundation is be on for about five to
six hours and let's have a look at how
it looks oh my god girl it literally
looks the exact same as how I put on I
cannot see one thing that is wrong with
it it is still as mad as it was before
so really confused so because it's
supposed to be luminous but it's
actually quite matte on my skin you
can't see a lot of highlighter going on
that's just because there's no Sun
outside and these lights right here are
picking up more of the highlight than it
was before so yeah we have a little bit
of laughs lines as I said before and
nothing you really do about that except
get a brush and wheel it around and it's
literally as good as new so I know this
foundation to makeup junkies I would
definitely say that this foundation is
amazing and go get it is definitely
worth it but the people that I kind of
like want to just spend like $30.00
Foundation and just want you know a good
foundation every day I wouldn't
recommend this because of how expensive
it is unless you want to spend the extra
- I don't know I do think it is worth
its price but for someone that uses a
lot of foundation and use it every day I
just think this would run out quickly
because I do use like four pumps on my
skin I don't know I'm kind of like
contradicting myself it's just the price
it's really expensive but it definitely
does live up to its price standards or
oh no it's up to you guys it just
depends on how much you want to spend I
definitely think it is worth it
definitely for someone that you know
likes to the try out different
foundations this would have to be one of
the best foundations that I've used I'm
very impressed with it
sorry I hope this video helped you guys
out a bit I just want to do it because
of the price and you don't go by
that you don't really know if it's good
or not but it definitely is like a 9 out
of 10 it's a really good foundation yeah
that's pretty much all I have to say so
if you guys want to see more videos give
this one a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel and I'll see you my next video
bye that's not ice cream mmm
kind of tastes like ice cream mmm pretty
good all right wait that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
