with the eyes I'm taking the NYX HD
concealer I love this concealer so much
and of course it is very affordable so
that makes it ten times better it's
super thick and it has a very very high
coverage so of course now I'm just going
to go ahead and set that concealer with
my Rimmel stay matte powder this is a
Holy Grail powder of mine it comes in
handy all the time now going in with my
BH Cosmetics genic so eyes shadow
palette and I'm picking up this yellow
shade right here and this is going to be
the transition shade so on a really big
fluffy brush I'm just going to take this
from inner corner to outer corner the
formula of these eyeshadows are
incredible definitely are comparable to
makeup geek they just blend up so so
smoothly then I'm going to take up
waitwhat I'm going to pick up this a
ready brown color and this is going
directly in the crease so we're going to
darken it up a little bit just taking
this again from inner corner to outer
corner but focusing it more in the
crease and not blowing it up as far now
of course it's time to blend so I'm
taking a clean blending brush and just
blending out any harsh lines from that
darker color you don't want to overdo it
because you still want a gradient from
darkest to lightest so for the lid color
I'm taking a warm matte Brown and just
popping this all over the lid I was
going to keep the eyes matte but I felt
like it just look really plain so I'm
picking up this shade from the Shen XO
palette it is very very pigmented and
I'm just going to put this directly over
the top and then of course blend out any
harsh lines again I swear to God I added
out so much of me blending it takes so
long but it's so worth it now for the
face I'm taking my NYX angel veil primer
and I'm going to go ahead and blend this
in with a brush this feels super nice I
love this product
now it's time for foundation I'm taking
the arrival on a new complexion
foundation this was the first time using
it and I really liked it I think the
color match was really nice too my fake
ten as well so I'm just going to go
ahead and blend this in with a brush
match my neck to my face it has a really
nice coverage nice finish and yeah I was
just really impressed with it and I got
it for like ten dollars as well which is
bargain now this is how you blend
foundation down your neck without that
double chin so for concealer I'm taking
that same NYX HD concealer I really like
the shade of this one as well because it
really highlights under my eyes and at
the same time it cancels out any
discoloration so now going ahead and
blending that out with a damp Beauty
Blender the beauty blenders have changed
coves now this is like a dark pink and
love the hot pink bring back the hot
pink I'm also going to use that
concealer to clean up my eye shadow that
has gone out a little bit too far it
just creates like a nice winged out I
show look without being too harsh so now
I'm going to highlight down the center
of my face and I also put a lot of my
nerves as well because foundation never
sticks to my nose and concealer just
like adds a bit more coverage to it
now it's time to go ahead and cream
contour so I'm taking this la girl Pro
conceal concealer and I'm just going to
put this under my cheekbones and also
around my forehead and my jawline so
just bronze up the skin a bit and add
some definition now it's time to bake
I'm taking this s fun loose face powder
I'm just going to pack this under my
eyes to make sure we don't have any
creasing of that concealer I think the
price of this product is really good but
I just noticed my foundation lifting a
little bit under my eyes I have used it
twice and it did happen twice so don't
know I'll keep using it and let you guys
know what I think but so far like I
really do like it I'm also going to set
the rest of my face as well just to make
sure all the products are you put over
the top blend out super seamlessly now
taking this cream white shade from that
gen Xer palette I'm going to use this to
highlight under my eyebrow so I'm just
going to pack this on and then of course
I like to go ahead and blend it out just
to make sure there's no harsh line
between my transition and the
highlighting shade then taking that
crease color once again I'm using this
to line my lower lash line so just on a
pencil brush I'm taking this from inner
corner to outer corner and this will
really tie the eyeshadow look together
and make it look more proportioned and
then two black buff that out a tiny bit
I'm just going to pick up this yellow
shade and run this onto that red color
just to diffuse it a little bit so it's
not as harsh I feel like that's the word
of the day there's no harsh line so it's
not harsh
okay showed me okay now going in with my
favorite mascara ever this is the
l'oreal extra black a telescopic mascara
i just picked up a new one I swear to
god I've gone through like 100 of these
Holy Grail
so just coating my top and bottom lashes
now going in with my Lily lashes in the
style Sydney so this is the only product
in the video that isn't affordable I
just couldn't help myself look how
pretty they I had to use them they're
really long and fluffy I just think they
really complement the eyes super well so
just popping these down and then
pinching my real lashes and then the
false lash band together so there's no
gap in between because I'm a super
dramatic person and I love super
dramatic lashes I'm just going to cut
some of that telescopic mascara over the
ends of my false lashes to make them
even longer and more dramatic for
bronzer I'm taking this Milani baked
bronzer and just going ahead and
bronzing up the face around the forehead
under the cheekbones on the jawbone this
is quite a shimmery product and it also
is very pigmented so be careful when
you're playing this make sure you use a
light hand
then going in with the NYC smooth skin
bronzing face powder I'm just going to
use this to contour a little bit I just
wanted a little bit more definition so
just putting this directly under my
cheekbones and one laughs where snatched
I'm also going to be contouring my nose
a tiny bit
I am so lazy with this I just use the
same brush C and again I'm just going to
take that airspun loose setting powder
directly under my bronzer just to make
it super harsh so I get for blush I'm
taking this Milani blush this is more of
a brown tone one I didn't want anything
too pink just want to try something
different and it wasn't overly exciting
I mean I know I feel like you can't
really tell it's on but it's too is kind
of cute especially for the price like it
does a pretty good job then taking my
Australis AC onto a palette and picking
up the yellow shade and the paler shade
and I'm just going to put this under my
eyes because I feel like I needed a
little bit more of a highlighted effect
under there
now it's time for highlight so I'm
taking this city color highlight trio
and I'm taking the pinky shade I'm just
going to put this directly on top of my
cheekbones really pack it on because I
love an intense highlight and wow look
at that glow this palette is honestly so
gorgeous I'm also going to put this
above my eyebrows down my nose and also
on my Cupid's bow as well because my
face was pretty matte so I just wanted
to add a little bit of a glow now it's
time for the lips I'm going to take a
pinky nude lip liner this one's from the
balm and I'm just going to go ahead and
draw my lips a little bit use my lip
filler has completely deflated so my
lips are hugged back to normal so I just
like to make them look a little bit more
plump then going in with this colour-pop
ultra matte lip and I'm just going to
coach my whole lips with this I think it
is such a beautiful brownie purple color
so stunning then to finish off the lips
I'm going to take a light pink shade and
I'm just going to put this directly in
the middle of my lips to create kind of
an ombre effect this will also give an
appearance of a bigger lip as well so
just blowing that out with my finger so
it all blends together nicely then to
finish off the makeup look I'm taking
this L'Oreal infallible makeup setting
spray I really really like this product
and so yeah that we have the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did please give it a
big thumbs up I love you guys so much
and I will see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
