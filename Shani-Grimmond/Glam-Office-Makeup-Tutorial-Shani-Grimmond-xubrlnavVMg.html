it's been a week since I've uploaded and
it killed me
I have no internet for like another two
weeks but I'm gonna work around that
they have a new puppy baby and you guys
would have seen her in my last video but
you go play down there so yeah I've been
very busy moving into a new house and
setting everything up I still don't have
everything organized but I'm working on
it my filming room is finally done I'm
still gonna be tweaking a few things in
my background I also have it on the
background that I'm going to be filming
with so it's not just going to be this
one but I'm actually quite happy with it
it looks very different to my last one
and just different to other youtubers I
didn't want to do just the desk behind
me because literally everyone does that
and I'm sick of it but yeah in today's
video I'm doing a very glam office look
so I didn't want to do the basic
electricity the cream and mascara and
all that which is probably something I
would lean towards if I were working in
office so I will leave that link down
below if you're interested in more of a
natural look but I just want to try
something a bit more glam and something
that will kind of make you feel a bit
more confident and sassy I sort of came
up with just a very soft I show look and
a really soft lip as well so I hope you
guys like it and let's go ahead and get
started first thing I'm doing is
applying some moisturizer this is the
Estee Lauder hydration is this for dry
skin because lately my skin has been
feeling so tight and dry and I just hate
it but even if you do have oily skin I
would recommend going in with and
moisturizer than is food for your skin
type I just feel like an apply the
foundation a lot better it goes on a lot
smoother and I just like the feeling of
like nice silky skin so just putting
about this much on my skin I use quite a
lot because my skin is just like
sandpaper at the moment yeah for you
guys that don't know I have a little
puppy now and she's sleeping on the
floor this is the first time that I've
filmed with many puppies so she's
actually being a very good girl right
now and sleeping thank God and then
going in with some eye cream and using
the arjan's zing-zing eye cream and I'm
just pumping a tiny bit under my eyes I
do this step every morning and night I
just feel like a normal voice trouser
doesn't really moisturize under the eyes
enough so always go over this
so before we get into the eyes I just
want to state the obvious my neck and my
body is extremely dark compared to my
face because all the ten come off my
face just letting you know so you're not
like what is wrong with her freaking
face anyways moving on to the eyes I'm
taking my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I
freaking cannot do my makeup without
this stuff if I'm doing any type of eye
shadow this always goes on there's one
us make sure the eyeshadow stays in
place and also if you don't even have a
shadow one you know make sure the
mascara doesn't transfer onto your
eyelid or it will make sure that your
eye would start it really it just does
like so many different things oh my god
I can't leave without it and then going
ahead and setting that prime out with a
little bit of powder it doesn't matter
what powder it is as long as you do set
it otherwise you that I shall they won't
really blend properly for the eyeshadow
I'm taking the Coastal Scents revealed 2
palette this has amazing colors in it
I'll just give you a quick Dee's just so
pretty
ok what color am I using today I'm going
to take this Bobbi kind of color right
here and this is going to be the
transition shader so popping up my
blending brush in there and then putting
that right in my crease I'm in the
process of growing my eyebrows out if
you're wondering why they look so crazy
at the moment the hardest part about
growing your eyebrows out is not
plucking them and having them look like
this and then taking this shade right
here it's just a really nice light
shimmery shade I'm just putting this all
over my lid just for a nice wash of
color and then picking up this showdown
here I'm putting this right in my crease
so kind of making a little cut crease
nothing too harsh and then taking this
shape right here I'm putting that right
in the center of my eyelid to kind of
make it pop a bit more and appear a
little bit bigger I always feel like
apply with my finger it applies the most
product so even though I've got all
these brushes Here I am and of course
going in with my Garnier micellar
cleansing water to clean up the edges of
that
and never miss his step because it just
changes the whole look of the ocean girl
okay so finally for foundation I'm
taking my ex1 invisi wear liquid
foundation this is in f 300 so I'm just
gonna put about three pumps on the back
of my hand and then start buffing it in
my face with the zoeva of 1:03 brush so
I'm just starting from the center of my
face and just buffing this in this does
have a really really nice color range
because it's mainly for people that
whole like yellowy olive undertones so
that's perfect for me I wouldn't say
that this foundation has a full coverage
I'd say that it goes up to about a
medium I wish this color within the SA
were double wear because that's like my
favorite foundation ever and now I'm
going in with my covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous concealer this is in the shade
medium I've actually never used this one
so I'm except to see how it goes
if you guys want a really good concealer
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer if
incredible oh well this isn't opening Oh
got it so I always like to highlight
under my eyes as you can see it is super
super light so just putting it under
there to also cancel out the
discoloration then going back in with my
foundation brush and just patting it in
nice and gently that's actually not a
bad consider at all not as good as my
Urban Decay one that's still pretty good
and then setting everything with my
Rimmel match perfection silky loose face
powder so firstly I'll just use what I
was in a lid to set under my eyes and
then I'll use the 101 zoeva brush to put
this on the rest of my eyes I love as
always a brushes so much if I could get
any brand it would be this so just very
quickly I'm going to finish off the eyes
so I'm gonna take this color right here
that we put in the crease and just pop
this on my lower
sign and this will just kind of tie the
look together and I'm putting this from
the outer corner to the middle of my eye
and then the cull that we put in the lid
from the inner corner to the middle and
for mascara I'm taking my benefit roller
lash um this isn't like the best mascara
I've tried but it does the trick so I'm
just gonna put this on my top and bottom
lashes and then highlighting my brow
burn with this light pink color right
here just under my eyebrow okay so just
quickly I'm going to fill in my eyebrows
with the anastasia soft brown eye brow
duo so I'm just gonna do this as I
usually do and then I'll be right back
because seriously this takes up so much
time and it's not really necessary okay
so now time to put some color into the
face finally I'm taking the makeup
forever Pro sculpting duo I think this
is in shade too so what I'm doing is
taking the bronzing shade back down
there and then putting this under my
cheekbones I'm really sorry about the
lighting it's sort dodgy right now I'm
gonna have to figure out how to deal
with that hmm now taking the rose petal
look cream blush by NYX I'm just popping
this on the apples of my cheeks because
the foundation is so mad I am using a
cream so it looks a bit more healthy I
didn't like this is not coming off hmmm
I don't really like matte foundations
because it just doesn't look really
healthy at all so this always
and then lastly taking my Bobbi Brown
bronze shimmer brick
I've only use this one so I'm quite
excited I'm using the top shades up here
to highlight my cheekbone mmm no no
pigmented as I thought it would be
I don't really see it it still is really
really pretty I just like to pack it up
because I like this strong contour I
meant highlight I'm also putting this on
my Cupid's bow and on my nose oh my god
the Sun is killing me time for lips I'm
taking my Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude
lip pencil oh my god I'm so excited to
use this you have no idea yeah and then
taking the NYX butter lipstick in this
shade no cap okay so I've chucked in a
blazer and my earrings and I feel like
I'm ready to go work in an office so if
I was to be working in an office I
probably would lean towards something
like this some days I'll probably be a
bit more lazy and go for something more
like my everyday makeup looks that I
will leave down below so just BB cream
no eyeshadow or lipstick just like lip
gloss and stuff I'd probably do that
more often but I just want to play
around different makeup today and see
what I could come up with and I
definitely still think this is work
appropriate so I'm super excited to do
more videos this week because it's been
so long since I've been uploading
frequently so yeah I'll see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
