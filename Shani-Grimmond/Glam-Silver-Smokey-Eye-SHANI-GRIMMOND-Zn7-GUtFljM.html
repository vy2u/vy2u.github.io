my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a makeup tutorial I haven't done like a
chitchat kind of one in a while so I
just thought I'd sit down and chat with
you guys I never do cool tones on my
eyes so I want to use these colors right
here and try something glittery ingrains
smokey so I'm excited to do that and I'm
really sorry in advance if you can hear
my sickness in my throat like the
quirkiness sounds like there's a toad in
there when I go anyway it's just ignore
that because I want to film anyway I got
bronchitis
anyways let's do this I'm gonna start
with my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as per
usual this stuff is amazing and look at
my veins on my eyes today are very red
so let's cover that up oh it's like a
dream and also don't mind my fingers
right here as you can see it's like
green that's from fake tanning um but I
feel so good having a fresh-baked turn
on right now yay and of course the next
step is to take some powder and set all
of that so all the colors blend out
nicely I feel like this is something I
say in every single video so let's just
skip past this bit firstly I'm going to
take this makeup geek eyeshadow in the
shade
and this is going to be it's going to be
my transition shade I'm scared I'm
really scared this is going to really
bad but let's do it anyway the brush
that I'm using is the zoeva to g7 which
is perfect for the crease to really blow
it out blow it out so just looking down
and taken in windshield wiper motions to
create a soft little transition Creasy
color you know so I have a new
microphone if you guys can notice the
sound a little bit different hopefully
it's better though I'm going to make
sure to drag it out all the way out here
so I can really elongate the shape of my
eye because I do have quite small eyes
and I will take a cotton tip later and
clean up that line there as well if
you're wondering why it looks so bizarre
right now now I'm going to take a 2 to 8
luxe crease brush by zoeva it's just a
little bit of a bigger version and it's
really easy to blend out stuff with this
so I'm just going to blend out above
where we just put that color
to make sure it's nice and soft and then
we are ready for the next step next I'm
taking the shade time travel by makeup
geek as well and I'm going to switch
back to that smaller brush to apply that
I'm just going to focus this one more in
the crease a bit more so to really
define that area
I'm not going to blend it up to like
high otherwise I'm going to look like a
bean crunch in the eyeball I'm also
going to pack that on the outer third I
would say of my eye so that bits smirky
and then I'm going to take a wet wipe
and just clean up all of that eye shadow
coming out the sides now I'm taking the
shade high-wire by makeup geek it's a
very sparkly silver I'm gonna put this I
think on the inner corner of my eye I'm
just gonna see what happens I guess wow
this is so pigmented so just putting
this on the inner corner and blending it
all the way through to the middle of my
eyelid just like this and before like
right now I never knew what colors
you're supposed to use in the crease
when it comes to like a gray smokey eye
so I've got some inspiration off lustre
lux's video and I use the same shades
like first two shades that she used in a
crease and so far so good so inspired by
luster luxe love their videos the next
shade I'm taking is galaxy by my Copic
as well surprise surprise
this okay why do I keep dropping
everything this is going to go kind of
like on the outer part of my eye oh wow
that's like the same color as the outer
crease color except it has sparkles in
it so now I'm going to blend these two
shades together by taking the first
shade right here the light silver I'm
just going to kind of blend over that
line
moving onto the face I'm taking the
simple kind of skin hydrating light
moisturizer I use this all the blow time
so just taking like a pea sized and
running in my face is really dry because
I've been traveling a lot on planes love
it next I'm taking the Nivea men
sensitive / shave balm I use this as a
primer and I below a love it last time I
did my makeup I forgot to use it and I
felt like whacking my whole makeup off
and doing it again obviously that's just
stupid so the smell when you first put
it on is pretty strong and manly but
once you put your foundation everything
on top you can't smell anymore I just
got back from Sydney yesterday I just
got my porcelain veneers done like my
top row I will make a whole video about
that if any of you guys are wondering I
didn't just get it for the way they
looked I got it for health reasons as
well but I'll get into that in another
video but yes so every time I'm in
Sydney I go to Sephora because there's
no Sephora here and I finally picked up
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundations I got the shade one two
three and y85
I couldn't choose between the two like
when I was watching them on my hand they
looked so incredibly different
like I would needed the in-between
shades so I just got both which was
annoying cuz they're expensive I think
I'm just going to put a pump of each but
more of one two three all right let's do
this I'm just applying it with a kabuki
brush well it's actually called a buffer
brush by zoeva oh let's see what this is
like hmm I don't know how or what I
think of this foundation yet so far I
think so good the color seems to lucky I
got two colors because it seems to be
matching my fake tan nicely um maybe I
should swap over to a Beauty Blender
because it's kind of very liquidy so
it's being streaky on me so got this on
standby all the time I wouldn't say that
it's like super full coverage I would
say it's kind of medium coverage I can
still see some acne scarring on my
cheeks and a little bit of redness
popping through up here but that's okay
because we'll put some concealer on I'm
going to take my little baby this is my
Urban Decay Naked skin in the shade at
lighten neutral so as you can see my
face is looking a bit dark and orange so
this is going to really wake me up a
little
they're just blending that in with my
Beauty Blender holy crap under my eyes
is sorry purple
thank God for concealer that's all I can
say so now that that's evened out of the
color of my face a bit more I'm taking
the Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder and I'm just going to bake under
my eyes before all that concealer
greases well I thought that was someone
running over a dog but that was tires
screeching good so just packing that
under there this stuff is so good like
what the hell
and I'm also going to put that in my
laugh lines because I might get really
bad okay so while that's baking under my
eyes I'm gonna do some cream contouring
with the Australis AC on to our
contouring and highlighting kit um I
think this call I don't I need or this
one I don't know let's see I don't know
how I feel about this I feel like it
looks muddy I'm just going to use what I
was left in a lid to set the rest Oh God
it's a lot
actually that cream contour isn't too
bad I think I just need to do some
practicing with the shades and stuff I'm
going to grab the two fur shades that we
put in the crease and I'm going to put
that on my lower lash line from in a
corner to add a corner I'm just going to
mix them together on a pencil brush and
do some damage it's really weird for me
to see colors like this on my eye like
cool tones I do prefer warm tones but it
looks looks kind of cool look like a
rock star
Oh looks like a bum buckle now I'm going
to highlight under my eyebrow so I'm
going to use this shade or right here
from the Too Faced natural matte palette
I'm just going to put this directly
under the brow and the eye shadow is
done for mascara I'm using the benefit
of roller lash and I'm just going to
coat my top and bottom lashes um my
foundation looks really overly matte I'm
pretty sure I just put too much powder
on but usually when I put that Laura
Mercier translucent powder over like my
other foundations it doesn't look this
matte that's totally fine though because
I've got to spray that I can put on my
face to make it look a bit more dewy
okay so now I'm gonna pop some lashes on
I'm just going to use these really
natural wispy looking lashes because I
just try to like a bigger pair and it
covers the whole eyeshadow look since
I've got a hooded eye so I'm going to
put this like smaller pair on so you can
still see the silver poking through I
feel like when you put lashes on your
whole look just looks ten times better
oh no frogs okay so lashes are on we're
all good to go let's do the eyebrows now
so I'm going to take my Anastasio dip
brow pomade in a medium brown and I'm
just going to fill in my brows usually I
use a powder because I find it much
easier but I kind of want to just try
something a little bit different today
oh my gosh my lashes are nearly touching
my brows this is gold right now
so basically what I'm doing is creating
an arch a bit more of a higher arch and
just extending my brow a bit longer okay
so next I'm going to take the Bahama
Mama Bruns up by the balm and I'm going
to take this on a rounded blush brush by
makeup here this one is a good one for
contouring so right under that cheekbone
club that add a little all of the
foundation on my nose I just like blow
off because I blew my nose and then I
tried to put more on top and now it's
separating hmmm the joys have been sick
how disgusting is it when you've got
like foundation crusting up on your lips
ah next I'm taking the hourglass a mood
exposure ambient lighting a blush and
I'm just going to put a little bit on
the apples of my cheeks
we just want like a little flush of pink
there that's kind of a lot of flush of
pink and then I'm going to take that
matte gold deposit and I'm just gonna
put a light wash of this on my cheeks
just for a nice bronzy glow because that
pink is really overpowering holy shit I
do not remember putting that much blush
on great that just ruined my whole
makeup next I'm taking the Becca
highlighter in a shade champagne pop I
haven't used this in so long so let's
see how beautiful it is oh gee Wizzle I
think I just like to go overboard with
like everything I think what I'm going
to do is line my lips with the NYX
retractable lip liner in nude and then
just put a gloss over the top let's just
see how that goes
the gloss that I'm going to put on is
you read my lips that lip gloss from the
bum in the shade snap it's kind of like
a deep nude Brown oh it smells so good
so there we have the finished look I
hope you guys liked it it's definitely
not something that I would always lean
towards because cool tones I just don't
think suit me very well um but I mean
it's okay it's fun to try out new colors
and new techniques and stuff so but yeah
I hope you guys liked this video if you
did please give it a big thumbs up and I
will see you very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
