hey guys my name is shawni and welcome
to my channel so in today's video I'm
doing a makeup look on this look right
here which I am very happy with I like
how it turned out very girly and
feminine looking so I've teamed up with
Sephora Comden ru to bring you this
video I've used all of their products of
their website they have some of the best
brands on their website I'm obsessed
with it I always shop a Sephora sorry
what they are doing the Black Friday
sale today so as you're watching this
video right now on the 25th they have a

shiny 20% off it only lasts for 24 hours
so you've got to get in quick I know
I'll be shopping on there but yes I hope
you guys enjoyed this a makeup look
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
for more videos I love you and let's
jump into it starting with the brows I'm
going in with the anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow pomade and this was the
first time i used it in a really really
long time and i was thinking oh my
goodness this is the best pomade I've
ever used I forgot how good it was it's
not true dry and it's not true wet so
it's really easy to work with it oh I
love it so much so now for concealer I'm
going in with the locket tattoo
concealer from a Kat Von D just to carve
out my brows to make them look super
defined and nice and neat my brows are
something else let me tell you so I like
to cover all of that baby hair
underneath it and make them look nice
okay now I'm just going to conceal my
eyelids to get rid of any veins so we
are ready for a shadow and then of
course setting that base down with a
powder so it's not sticky and then I'm
taking the Tarte pretty paint box
collectors a makeup case this is insane
so I'm going to start with the shade
hearts and crafts and this one's going
to be the transition shade just so all
of the other colors blend out really
easily so just taking it on a really big
fluffy brush then I'm taking a warm
matte Brown and this is going in the
crease to define it even more add some
warmth add some color I always go in and
blend my eye shadow up to every step
just so it's nice and seamless so the
next shade I'm taking is a charcoal
sketch and this one is going directly in
the crease with a small pencil brush I'm
really going to define that crease and
you don't have to be true neat because I
I'm going to clean it up with a bit of
concealer and then I'm just taking a
small angled liner brush to carve out my
crease so I like to bring it a little
bit higher than my natural crease just
because I have tiny little beady eyes
but just carving that out and then I
like to fill it in with just a normal
concealer brush now for the lid color
I'm taking the shade it gets surreal
it's a really pretty rosy pinky purple
shade so I'm just packing this all over
the lid with a small synthetic brush
making it really opaque and then I'm
just taking a glitter liner and lining
where the cut crease and the transition
shade it meets just add a bit of glitter
a bit of girliness and this is really
easy so it's like a win-win search I
love it I feel like it made the whole
look now I'm going in with primer this
is the makeup forever radiance primer
I'm not sure why it's orange I've never
used it before but I have had it for the
longest time so I thought let's give it
a try when I put the foundation over the
top it did cover all of the orange nurse
which is like all I care about and as
long as I know my makeup is going to
stay on all day I'm happy now going in
with the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation this is a very very full
coverage foundation and you only need a
really small amount but knowing me I put
like the whole bottle on my face I do
this every time but if you guys need a
very full coverage foundation I would
definitely recommend this one
it doesn't feel overly heavy but it
definitely covers everything now going
back in with my Kat Von D lock at
concealer I really really like this one
it's really full coverage but it also
blends out really easily so I'm just
putting this under my eyes and blending
it out with a Beauty Blender my favorite
way to blend concealer and then also
down the center of my face as well to
really highlight it since that
foundation was very full coverage it
just took out all of the color of my
face so we want to add some dimension
back into it now it's time to set that
concealer down in place I'm taking the
Kat Von D translucent powder this was my
first time at using this one as well so
just under my eyes to make sure that
concealer does not crease now I'm going
in with the hello flawless powder by
benefit in the shade honey just to set
the rest of my face this is a very full
coverage powder I probably didn't need
to
this as well as the mic Jacob is one but
I love this powder and I can never go
without it now for under the lash line
I'm just taking that same crease color
just to really balance out the eyes so
I'm just taking that on a fluffy pencil
brush and then it's time for mascara I'm
taking the benefit roller lash this
stuff is incredible I've been using it
for so long now and I think it's a
really good mascara for just volumizing
and prepping them for those falsies and
taking the huda beauty lashes in the
shade I meant in the style of Russia
Russia and I'm just popping these ones
down these ones are very dramatic and
they have a very thick band so keep that
one in mind and then for a nice pop of
color on the waterline I'm just taking
this gold I learn it from zoeva and then
for contouring i'm taking the Kat Von D
shade and light palette to really carve
out my cheekbones so I'm just mixing two
colors to get the perfect shade now
going in with the Marc Jacobs bronzer
this one is incredible it is completely
matte so it's very different for me but
it has a beautiful undertone like it's a
little bit orange so it's a perfect
sunkissed glow kind of look it's really
easy to blend out it literally feels
like butter so just putting this under
my cheekbones and also around my
forehead because Hans
I've got to match that face to my fake
tan Nick now it's time for blush I'm
taking this one from zoeva and just
using the same brush to apply it so it
all kind of blends into one and then of
a highlighter I'm taking this one from
Becca it is called opal this one is a
literally blinding are you kidding me
I'm just using my Anastasia highlighter
brush to apply it and it literally just
looks insane like I love it so much
I've been waiting for this moment for so
long now finally the huda beauty liquid
lipstick I will leave all the shades and
everything of everything that I'm using
down below if you guys are interested
but the formula of this liquid lipstick
is on another level so just popping that
all over and then I went in with the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in the shade and milkshake to really
lighten it up a little bit because it
wasn't really matching the eye color
because it was like warm lips cool eyes
so I tried to like make it work a bit
more and
love how it turned out so I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
head over to Sephora if you're
interested in a little shopping free
with discount I love you guys so much
