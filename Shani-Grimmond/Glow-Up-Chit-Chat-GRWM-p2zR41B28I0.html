oh my gosh I haven't actually filmed a
makeup tutorial in the longest time I'm
really excited so in today's video I
just want to kind of play around with a
few new products that I have and just do
a really nice glow up makeup look
because I haven't done Oh clam in a hot
minute so let's go ahead and jump into
the video mmm my gosh it is so freaking
hot in Brisbane like my aircon is not
working I'm pretty sure because everyone
else in this apartment is trying to get
that air gonna work oh no luck for us oh
my gosh I haven't used this product in
so long it is the long way brow gel in
the shade taupe by Bobbi Brown this one
is super easy to use the last time I
used it
let's see how this goes so what's been
going on with me and I just got back
from Sydney and Melbourne I went to
Sydney for the Bondi sands launch party
for their new Sun care range and then I
was like oh hey while I'm in Sydney I
may as well pop over to Melbourne and
party a little bit so I went in partied
after Derby Day and that was heaps of
fun I hadn't been out in so long because
I'll stop offering from my boob job so I
just wanted to like go out and socialise
and stuff because I kind of have been
trapped in my room for the past like two
weeks because I wasn't allowed to drink
ooh like really do anything so I let my
beads brooke hovel so I just felt like I
knew that time to get out and like hang
out with people and now I feel so much
better I'm just gonna go in with a
little flat shader brush and cough out
my eyebrows even though already looking
super clean that's a new one oh my go
that's my chocolate bar I had yesterday
uh yeah even though my brows looking
nice and sculpted I just want to make
them extra sculpted with this concealer
I literally have the worst posture
especially with like big boobs now it's
like weighing me down I have to make
sure to sit up that's this drink oh my
gosh my baby's looking so good as well
oh so happy with them next step is to
prime my eyelids to get rid of these
veins oh my gosh that taut concealer
that I always use oxidizes so
I never really thought it was that bad
but like a good difference still of it
for the I shudder today I'm gonna go in
with this a Morphy dare to create a
shadow palette this one is seriously so
big
it is the collaboration with James
Charles so I'm gonna go in with this
transition color and then I think I'm
going to work with these greens they
look so beautiful but yeah that's just
tank a little bit that on a blending
brush I got all my brushes clean so I'm
really happy about that I'm not gonna
lie I seriously feel disgusting with
these pimples on my face I'm so over it
ever since I went off the pill my skin
has returned back to how it used to be
not as bad I'd say because before I went
on the pill I literally had acne but I'm
just gonna deal with it like whatever I
need to start eating better and just
look off to myself but I booked in to
see a doctor about my hormones and all
of that so hopefully I'll have an answer
about these guys really soon the next
color I'm gonna take is this one right
here this one is super green I think
this is gonna look amazing and I also
have some colored eye contacts that I
want to put in at the end so it's really
cool to see my crease Oh looks like
moths that's stunning feeling a little
bit sick today I don't know why we think
something's always freakin wrong with me
all right sir I just went in with that
color now I'm gonna go in with this dark
ah emerald and I'm just gonna use that
to deepen up the crease a little bit no
but I'm so annoying okay so I'm just
going to put it right on the outer half
just with any blending brush
they kind of look a little bit patchy on
my eyes I don't know why my skin is
really dry at the moment so that could
be a reason but they are pretty
pigmented very happy about that and then
with that a lot of green I'm just gonna
take that above the tops to blend out
the edges the next shade I am going to
take oh this one's pretty I like that
one a lot is this like turkey brownie
color I'm just gonna pack that all over
my lid I have never used a color like
that on my lip before sorry let's change
it up a little bit all right I'm just
gonna spray my brush with a bit of fix+
because I want to be kind of like a
foiled I shudder because I'm an intense
bitch like can you do
oh that's sorry pretty i have silver
reflux in it it's called honestly works
beautifully with green because it has
like the tiniest tiniest touch of green
in it it's kind of easier to apply with
your fingers though okay so next step is
to clean up any fallout we have so I'm
just gonna take a makeup wipe and I'm
gonna do a little bit of a cleanup here
since the colors are a bit dark okay
time for the foundation sir
well primer I'm gonna go in with the
Fenty Beauty primer I've heard really
good things about this one so I'm just
gonna take three pumps and work this all
of my face well it feels really nice
I've used it a few times and I really
liked it okay this foundation is
seriously amazing it's from g'way it is
called the essential high coverage cream
foundation and I have this shade a latte
I'm not sure if this is my right color I
literally have every single color but
this is the one that I have out so I'm
gonna make it work um yeah let's have a
chat what's been going on in my life
that I haven't told you guys you know on
other than the fact that this foundation
is so full coverage actually blows my
mind like it's crazy huh goodbye
whatever I guess I've just been in a
little bit of a rut because I haven't
like I don't really know what likes high
videos I want to film in my channel cuz
I want to do I wanna do like more
personal videos over makeup tutorials if
you only mean
like a love of logging that's so much
fun but I kind of needed to like we'll
wait to my boobs and had healed a little
bit so I could kind of like do more
things I'm so laughs intense for this
beauty blender it looks a bit yellow now
but or when I put runs are and stuff
when it looks amazing time for concealer
I'm gonna go in with this one from Becca
aqua luminous perfection concealer in
the shade fair I love this one
I'm just gonna use this to brighten up
under my eyes a little bit so we can
have a bit of dimension on my face there
we go that's what I'm talking it out and
I do need something kind of hydrating
onto my eyes just because my whole face
is so dry at the moment like I'm ready
for it I think it's cuz I mean like on
and off planes and and then just set my
concealer down I'm going in with the
s-bahn powder I'm just going to bake a
little bit underneath my eyes my Beauty
Blender just when I get any creasing oh
I'm also gonna break here cuz I get
really bad laugh lines because a problem
and then for powder I'm gonna go in with
the same side of it I always use the
hello flawless eye benefit in the shade
champagne I'm just going to dab that all
over my face so my foundation is
completely set it's gonna be super that
alright let's do this so our lower lash
line I'm gonna go in with this green
color and I'll just take that from out
of chlorine hakuna I'm gonna have to
find a little brush because this doesn't
have a mirror on it where you got a
million mirrors anyway so whatever I'm
just gonna take that own a blending
brush i'm just taking any highlighter
that i have this one is becca in the
shade re pool and i'm gonna highlight my
inner corners i feel like we need a bit
of a pop in there just a little bit and
i just paid my brush with big plus of
course that's better
okay sorry quickly I'm just gonna set my
eyebrows because I want them to like
kind of go up would say they look more
full so I'm gonna take this Maybelline
brow drama sculpting brow mascara in the
shade medium brown it was like a little
ball on the end of it I'm just gonna use
that to brush my hair upwards use this
in ages and then I'm gonna go in with
this black eyeliner from zoeva in the
shade black to earth and I'm just gonna
line my waterline I haven't done this in
so long
Wow and then I'm gonna go in with this
essence mascara this one is called the
full C's lashes mascara and I'm gonna
hurt my top and bottom lashes so then we
can add some falsies some big massive
falsies oh oh alright now that my face
is yellow and my neck is a literally
different color at the time to go and
bronzer I'm gonna go in with this
Physicians Formula bronzer in the shade
Argan where I'm literally gonna put so
much on I'm like what do you actually
mean this brush is a Inglot on my Lord
Jesus Christ that has long name three
six bjf brush that was really long I'm
like well why does that have to be a
thing could it be called like the to
look brush or something something keep
I'm also gonna go in with a touch of the
Mac of gold deposit for a little bit of
shimmer just over the top of that okay
legit I feel like I'm going to vomit
like I don't know what's wrong with me
I'm just gonna pull through this because
I actually really like this I should I
look I can hang out sorry I'm just gonna
bake a little bit with my S bun paddle
just because they always go a little bit
overboard with my bronzer what's new
okay so now for the blush I'm gonna take
this one from our gloss this one's in
the shade mood exposure I hardly ever
use this want to end I think I paid
quite a bit of money for at low I'm just
gonna use it it is really pretty you
