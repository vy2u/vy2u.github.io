and by the way the issues that we're
coming sekito so we just said it's my
restaurant at the moment we have some
spring rolls are they good
relax and then I also got something else
to eat as well start hungry is my life
today
every unbuttons of my pants
I regret I can't breathe rumbling these
so we have like an alice said so we go
to the consultation
anyways it was like a bunch of like I
would say like grade three like that
nine years old
you needed stuff so I was like I was
talking about something taking my love I
like speed a little bit that he swears
like it's mostly done so I guess I like
young people watch my the area so let's
write it down like seeing it in real
life I think little kids in real life we
have made it let's see
yeah oh my god yeah I'm so excited oh my
god okay so I have my little breasts in
and I'm loving the size of these ones
this is 250 this is that right yeah Oh
with a 350 that I tried on before I
think it's feel really good and so
natural you can space it if you want we
squeeze it it feels so little unnatural
I love it okay sorry we just got out of
the consultation well there for that
like 25 minutes and turns out that I'm
gonna get like around a 350 CC to 350 90
because I have a very wide chest and
like it needs to be filled because it's
just completely flat like down here is
just completely fat what a little look
completely flat sorry like I need a
decent sized implant for everything to
be in proportion like with my bomb and
like all of that so I'm just gonna like
leave it up to the surgeon to decide
like what size is gonna like to suit my
body the best cuz he obviously knows
what he's doing and I've seen all of his
work on social media and like I know
that he is like incredible at what he
does so
I will let you guys know who I'm going
to see in the vlog where I actually get
it done if you guys are interested in
that but I'm so excited and I booked a
date for the 18th of October so
literally it's in like a month
I'm so excited and Michael's so excited
look after me by the way I asked them if
I can leave for him a day early so you
can go to so hard what do you do I was
like they're like can you come can you
stay until Monday like the week after so
we will get there on Tuesday July no I
literally was like they're like okay so
you'll get here on Tuesday have a
surgery on Wednesday and then you can
leave on Monday and I was like oh can I
leave on Sunday because my friend
actually has to be somewhere and they're
like oh yeah okay I'm like you obviously
go out every Sunday and I didn't want
you to like miss out because I mean if
I'm like dying obviously I'll just
change the fly and you can go home or
like you can stay all that and leave you
in Sydney after getting intense time
well I will just see I'll just say how
about I won't book the flight time until
after the surgery to see how I feel you
know yeah but Michael was filling my
boobs the whole time you loved it
don't say that I really think I'm gonna
close it straight because sorry many
people have this conspiracy theory that
I'm actually straight on or anywhere
make up and do that because so I can
like hang out with girls and stuff
that's a conspiracy theory apparently
that's so true like apparently how
Chloe's me I don't who's Chloe
and him look-alike apparently cuz they
burn some big nerdy so I come over
ah what something he's birthday Oh
well sorry we're going to get out flat
at 7:30 so we're just on that way then
now and I'm just trying to think if
there's any other things that I want to
like tell me guys
apparently it's like a true week
recovery like it's very fast can't sleep
on my belly for a while which I'm really
upset about because I only sleep on my
stomach it's weird
I do have to change there to feel that
I'm because I'm gonna go back on the
pill right oh I do you have to change
the pill that I'm gonna go on because
otherwise my dreams will grow again cuz
absolutely it was really big
and then obviously when I went off that
they decided and that's why this is like
this whole situation is going why are
you laughing
nothing I'm just thinking you funny
that I could say okay what are you like
making fun of nice thank you baby
I wouldn't dance ah oh my god we have to
tell them what's coming this week we
should yeah something very special and
over my favorite they just like
everyone's probably gonna be expecting
back couple condoms everyone's like oh
no all the collaborators on condoms but
yeah we collaborated with glass I know
it's Eric and it's so much more exciting
minute
yeah it is pretty cool actually anyway
coming I was saying really really cool
on every day it's true days everyone's
been asking for it oh yeah a lot of
people like it's an amazing day we
decided that we should finally do it and
get our together and yeah
three days it's launching sir I was
ready to press return so make sure you
check it out my Instagram is obviously
these to me followers Michael where's
with Mac that's so embarrassing you're
even news man huh you know what I
actually created that snapchat name when
I was younger I didn't even own a
 Mac products iron - one of them
was it from eBay was fake and I woke up
the next morning I had a swollen eye
looked at me it was like yeah it was the
Mac Wonderwoman collection eyeliner was
three dollars eighty going under the
muscle
another thing is I'm getting a teardrop
shaped implant so it's gonna look so
natural so the whole point of this is
just to like proportion out my boobs
because honestly like sorry flat and F
or March search is gonna lift them up
with the implant so it's gonna be tiny
and I'm gonna be so excited
I'm sorry man he made one that was
really good yeah
well I obviously don't want to people
yet like me saying I want you to get a
good job I think you'll be good enough I
think it's just a personal decision that
I'm making because I feel like it's
going to make me happier and I don't
want it to like alter how anyone else
feels about their and variables like you
should be happy with your boobs like I'm
happy with my boobs but I just I wanted
just to make a little improvement for
myself and not for anyone else so don't
feel like your boobs aren't perfect you
don't need a boob job what what like
today I met like heaps of us and they're
like oh I'm so jealous you getting jobs
I'm like I don't want people to be
jealous and I'm being a dream job I want
people to be like happy with their own
boobs but if you're not happy with your
hands we've said she was Asian if you
want to do something about it like
probably my boyfriend did Mississippi
