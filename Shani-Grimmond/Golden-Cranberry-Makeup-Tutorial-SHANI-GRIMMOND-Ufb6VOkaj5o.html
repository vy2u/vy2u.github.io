gonna start out with my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot just behind my eyes I honestly
just can't find a better eye primer
sorry there's no point on chopping it up
when this is the best so then once I've
done that I'm gonna set it with it's um
like a loose powder just to make sure
that the eye shutters over the top blend
out nice and seamlessly so for the
eyeshadow today I'm using the nude
spectrum palette by zoeva and I'm gonna
take a cool turn of medium brown and
this is gonna be the transition shade so
just running this back and forward in my
crease this is a beautiful palette the
eyeshadows are so easy to blend so
pigmented and just absolutely beautiful
now taking this a warm term brown shade
this is gonna go a little bit more
directly in the crease so we have to
warm things up a little bit I cannot
stay away from warm eyeshadow shades so
just blending this out with a blending
brush making it nice and seamless I will
leave everything that I'm using in this
video in the description box below if
you guys are interested of the names and
the brush styles and stuff like that
using that same palette I'm going to
take this beautiful gold shade and I'm
going to spray my brush with some fix+
so it really does stick to the eyelid
and to make it even more pigmented and
I'm just going to pack this all over my
lid no lids not just one two
I always like to go in between my eye
shadow steps with blending out the eye
shadow to make sure it stays nice and
seamless so next I'm going to take a
black eye shadow by makeup geek this is
the blackest black eye shadow you will
ever meet in your life
so I'm just gonna put this on the outer
lid and also blend it kind of halfway in
my crease
Oh would you look at that I'm blending
my eyeshadow once again so next step is
to clean up those lines it's my favorite
part honestly because it just like makes
it look so much cleaner so much more
crisp so I'm just using a makeup wipe
for that it's super easy and it honestly
makes such a difference so put the face
I'm gonna use my vitamin enriched base
base by Bobbi Brown I'm just gonna rub
this in I felt like my skin was really
dry so I wanted something super rich and
this was a perfect full foundation I'm
taking the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation and mixing it with the
Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow to have a
really nice luminous finish how amazing
is that color match for my neck so I'm
using a makeup geek foundation brush and
this just makes the foundation go on so
smoothly I'm obsessed
and then for concealer I'm taking out my
trusty Naz a radiant conflate what is it
even called I haven't used in that long
when I forget my radiant creamy
concealer and this is in the shade it
custard is the perfect shade for
highlighting so we're just blending it
out with my Beauty Blender to get a
really nice soft airbrushed fish and now
taking the Anastasi of banana shade from
the contour palette I'm just gonna set
under my eyes to keep it really nice and
hydrated oh my god I meant highlight and
I'm also going to go down and center my
face to keep that bright as well so for
the rest I'm gonna take the Rimmel stay
matte powder to make sure that
everything that goes on top blends out
really nicely I tend to see if I don't
set my face with powder the bronzer and
stuff get a little bit choppy and it's
kind of hard to blend out then taking
that same warm brown shade I'm just
gonna put that on my lower lash line so
from inner corner to outer corner on a
little pencil brush
next I'm taking my BADgal liner it is a
waterproof black eyeliner from benefit
it is so pigmented and it really does
last a long time so I'm just lining my
waterline with that to make it super
intense next I'm gonna take my Kat Von D
liquid liner this is an amazing eye
liner I'm just gonna line at my lashline
to make sure you don't see any false
eyelash band when I put those ones on
now taking my covergirl mascara this is
definitely one of my favorites it works
so well I love the shape of the one it's
kind of like a butterfly shape so just
putting this on my top and bottom lashes
prepping them for those falsies to make
the eye shadow really pop I'm gonna put
this over the top it's a liquid liner
from NYX and I have to layer it up a few
times to make it really intense so if
you guys know of any glitter liquid
liners that are really good and very
lack opaque please let me know in the
comments below because I love putting
glitter on my lids and of course for my
brows I'm taking the essence eyebrow
stylist set I have probably used this in
like my last 20 makeup tutorials but I
can't help it it's such low quality and
it's so incredibly cheap so I'm just
using the darker shade to fill up my eye
brows in
it is time to apply my false lashes I
love the way that false lashes look like
a concur with that unlike a dramatic
look because it just hides the look
together but be honest it's a pain in my
ass to apply them so now I'm just gonna
highlight under my brow bone this kind
of just pulls a look together just to
make sure there's no bare skin left on
the eyes now taking this shimmery shade
from the same palette I'm just gonna pop
this right on my inner corners to
brighten up the eyes a little bit for
contouring today I'm gonna take the
Bahama Mama bronze out by the balm this
stuff is the best contour shade ever so
I'm just gonna put this in my cheekbones
with my eater' brush by nose I've been
using this brush for like two days and I
can already say it's like the best
contour brush I've ever used it just
makes it so easy because it just gets
right in those cheekbones and it's
pretty much impossible to make a mistake
with this brush so it also is really
good to contour my nose so that's what
I'm doing now I love doing this step now
we're gonna go hard with some bronzer so
I'm taking my Mac gold deposit and I'm
just gonna burn my whole entire face
basically this is my favorite brush to
use for bronzer it is a Real Techniques
either a powder or blush brush it just
works so well so under my cheekbones and
also around the perimeter of my face to
look really JLo like really we're on
the--
now taking my cindy lou manizer blush by
the Barneses
a beautiful rosy alumina shade so I'm
just gonna put this on the apples of my
cheek and blend it back I wanted to use
kind of like a shimmery blush just to
keep the sites looking really beautiful
glowy sir speaking of glowy I'm gonna
take the Naz albatross highlighter and
just highlight the heck out of my face
last but not least I'm taking this true
face melted lipstick it is a beautiful
purple plum you shade I want to try
something a little bit different cuz I'm
always sticking around my nudes and the
red and this oh I'm just so obsessed
with this shade and the formula is
beautiful and it's so easy to apply so
since I did a purple if I wanted the
eyes to kind of tie in with it so I took
my makeup geek Coco bear eyeshadow it
just made the whole look come together
and made the look kind of family instead
of not related you know what I mean
anyways I'm gonna blend that in my
crease and then blend it out with a
clean brush to make it nice and seamless
once again and yeah that we have the
finished makeup look I hope you guys
loved it if you did please give it a
thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe
