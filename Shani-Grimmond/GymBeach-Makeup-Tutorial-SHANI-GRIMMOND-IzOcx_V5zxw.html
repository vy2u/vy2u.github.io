channel sorry I feel like I said on the
exact same turn every single intro like
I'm doing channel okay welcome to my
channel so in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a makeup look that is suitable for
the gym or the beach or the pool or
anything like that
I personally don't wear makeup to any of
those occasions I mean the beach
sometimes I'm taking photos let's be
real but what I'm going to Jim I never
wear makeup but this is for people that
don't feel comfortable going without
makeup or they just want to put makeup
on to feel better whatever the reason is
it doesn't matter you can do whatever
you want so let's go ahead and jump
right into the video I'm gonna go down
to the pool and gym after and do a
little workout and swim so I'll take you
guys with me and we'll see how it all
lasts on my skin so the first thing that
I'm doing is taking this at Dermalogica
oil-free matte SPF this one has an SPF
of 30 so obviously if you're going on
the Sun you always want to apply
sunscreen and I really like this one
because this doesn't disturb the makeup
in any way and it also keeps the face
nice and matte that's amazing
considering I'm going to be sweating and
all of that so I don't want to be I mean
obviously I'm still gonna sweat but like
it's still gonna make the face not as
shiny as it would be I'm just gonna give
this one a good shake and put it on the
back of my hand then I'm just gonna
paint this all over my face with a
paddle brush it actually smells like
fruit like it's very citrusy refreshing
you obviously want to make sure you are
applying sunscreen everyday if you are
going out in the Sun I personally don't
go out in the Sun a whole lot but when I
do I do like to apply this and it's
super light on the skin as well it says
on the back of the sunscreen helps
prevent breakout burn skin which is
amazing because as you can see I've been
breaking out quite a bit and I don't
need anything and making my pimples or
breakouts or anything any worse and a
lot of those really thick oily
sunscreens can do this so I would
definitely recommend this one and I do
have a discount code that goes to the
end of December if you guys interested
in saving 20% so you can use the curry
dat shiny 28 check out I'll leave that
link down below if you guys are
interested but let's go ahead and move
on to the base so I mean I definitely
was gonna skip concealer I meant
foundation
I think I might see but still because
like I personally would never wear like
a foundation to the gym if you do that's
really fine I was gonna use a tinted
moisturizer but I think I could just
like work with concealer sorry I'm gonna
take this one by Maybelline this is the
fit me concealer in the shade light
sorry this one isn't actually true light
so very so I'm gonna highlight it's just
gonna conceal them so if you do have
active pimples make sure you put it on
with a brush and don't just like pop it
on the pimples because that could spread
the pimples and yes I'm doing exactly
what I should be doing but like then I'm
just gonna take a little petal brush and
I'm just gonna lightly dab or eval
all those pimples I don't want to make
it around too much just because it will
disturb that can sail on I really need
it to cover all these bad boys Clary
Fray
I'm really just started right by the way
this brush is the Real Techniques
essential foundation brush I also chose
this concealer as well because it's
super lightweight so it doesn't feel
like you have anything on your face at
all and of course I'm just gonna take
that concealer and put a little bit
under my eyes as well to get any taller
to get rid of those purple turns under
that this is gonna really make me look
more awake and I'm just gonna put a bit
more on that people they're just like
really big okay so it is go away lightly
dabbing or EVO on my eyes I'm just gonna
take whatever's left over my eyelid as
well just to hide some of those veins
beautiful I'm gonna go ahead and set
that down with my Rimmel stay matte
powder I'm just going to Pat underneath
my eyes very gently facade it is so that
doesn't crease under that and then also
on my eyelid I'm also just gonna set
wherever is shining on my face even
though we're gonna saw wet our hearts
out very soon it's really fine alright
there's literally nothing on my forehead
see how are you alright next I'm going
to take a lip
this is the water lips lip balm I like
to put on the border of my lips as well
so it creates the illusion of bigger lip
it's like a kind of put lip balm outside
of my lips okay so time for the eyebrows
it really depends what you want to do
with your brows you can of course go in
with an hour and I wrap product that is
like kind of waterproof me personally I
don't really need to fill my browsing
because they're super bold as they are
sore I'm just gonna go ahead and put the
benefit gimme brow eyebrow gel in the
shade 3 this is gonna color them make
them a bit darker and also make them a
bit more full because it's a little
fibers in it so I'm just gonna push them
up very much I've been using it my whole
life now I've been using like pretty
much since it come out there next up I'm
gonna curl my eyelashes to make them
look a little bit longer cause my lashes
just so short so I'm like over it just
makes them look a tiny bit longer for a
little bit obviously when you're on the
pool the whole this is just gonna go out
the door that's alright
then if the mascara I'm gonna take the
true face better than sex a waterproof
mascara obviously you want to use a
waterproof mascara because it's gonna
transfer all over your lids if you're
going to the gym and obviously if you're
swimming I mean even if you know
swimming you're just gonna swear it's
just gonna get a little smudgy and black
so next I'm just gonna take a tiny bit
of blush this one is the top blush in
the shade exposed I feel like I just
need a little bit of color on my cheeks
cuz it's looking a little bit dull I
mean this is like essentially what I pop
it on my face ride the pink on my cheeks
not like I'm putting it back on whatever
it makes everything look super natural
anyway okay sir next I'm gonna go in
with this and a star's yacht liquid glow
in the shade at pull-offs or I'm just
gonna put this on the back of my hand
just a really small amount and then I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender
take the bum of that and just bounce
that on my cheekbones as you can see
it's a really nice glow to
face you don't need to do this if you
feel like being extra is but that's just
me love a bit of a glory
even when I'm gonna be sweating my whole
off this is not recommended to curl your
lashes off you put mascara on but once
again any bedroom what alright lastly
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face just
a glam glow once it smells really good
so I just use all the time oh my gosh
tastes pretty good too oh here we have
the finish to makeup look I think it
looks super cute super healthy and glowy
and natural which is amazing so I hope
you guys enjoyed the makeup portion now
I'm gonna go jump in the pool and see
how it looks oh my face so I'm going to
the hairdresser's a few hours and I went
to cry with the chorus Florina sorry I
need you to
Oh what is that something that yeah what
a proof what do you mean what a perv I
just did one dunk
I'm over it yeah okay so my makeup is on
still I'm really impressed with how it's
busted

because like obviously that's when
everything's gonna be like bye sorry I
