my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a house tour so I'm taking a run to my
whole house and showing you around so
I'm really going to be in this house for
like another like three months or
something and then I'm moving again
I just love moving so this isn't like my
finished color result like what I want I
do want to make it more fancy but I'm
just going to wait till I move into my
next house because the next house is
moving to hopefully I'm standing out for
a really long time so yeah I hope you
guys like this video and let's go ahead
and get started let's start with my land
room so my front door is right here and
this is the first thing that you see
when you walk into my house it's all
black and playing I need to add some
color and stuff so that's pretty much
all for my land room and then over here
I have my little egg chair I had like a
lot of space over here so I had to add
something and I just have to bring this
in from outside right next to the lounge
room we have a staircase that goes all
the way up through my three rooms and my
bathrooms and stuff but I'll show you
that later to the left over here we have
a laundry a toilet and my hallway into
the kitchen the right next to the toilet
that no one ever uses we have my
cardboard and then doing a 180 we have
my kitchen so as you can see I have the
stainless steel bar going this kitchen
is extremely narrow so it's really hard
to feel actually people in there at once
which is you're annoying and there's
only one pathway so that's why that's so
much clutter oh my god let's take a
minute to appreciate my cupboard there
is so much food and please tell me why
does the power point in there I have no
idea and can you guys tell that I love
me some more shop look a batch and of
course here is my dining table I got
this
sale at fantastic furniture I am in love
with it and directly behind the chain we
have the app doors and then of course
the first ring that we see here it's my
sterling room there are a few things in
here that I might leak to make it look
nicer so we have my really big window
here for natural lighting like my film
in the daytime and then we have my
studio lights my background I do want to
change out all the continuously change
it just so it doesn't get boring England
we have my makeup holder or makeup
drawer right here I do want to another
one because there isn't really enough
room for my makeup and of course if you
guys want to see a makeup collection
video I would be more than happy to do
that I have so much stuff to share with
you guys and then over here we have a
bathroom for this obviously is like an
ensuite room but the other bathroom is
like a really sleazy shake and I just
don't like it so use this one instead I
love the bathrooms in this house they're
so nice under the sink I have all of my
extensions so it just seems that I use
all the time like my dry shampoo your
moisturizer effect hen and all that good
stuff in the first drawer I have even
more essentials so like my makeup rig
what's my moisturizers and all that and
then in the second drawer I've got all
my hair stuff so my straightener my
brushes my hair ties you know how it is
and then walking out of my be room we
have another bathroom that I never use
so let's just keep moving this is what
my room looks like I love how simple it
is but I do you want to change other
things it is a little bit boring so if
you guys have any ideas of like themes
and stuff let me know in the comments
first thing we have right here is my
desk so we have my iMac which I never
use because it's really slow so I will
just use my macbook pro we
plant the kind of accent color in this
room which is like the only human
actually adds color and then we have my
bed over here this one is a queen but I
really want to get a king because my
boyfriend sleeps with me and I like to
start fish it doesn't leave me enough
room and then walking into my wardrobe
we have a bunch of clothes hanging up I
can hardly fit anything else in there
now there we have all of my shoes on the
ground I just got these new runners do
you guys like them I am obsessed with
them they are so comfortable and they
look really nice as well and then on the
top shelf
I've got like all my bags and belts and
everything nothing too interesting and
then in this IKEA drawer I just have
like my undies my bras some pants and
gym wear and all of that so there we
have my room nothing too interesting so
let's move on to Jonathan's room so this
is where he stores all these clothes and
then we have a spare bed for when my
brother's to come over or if you have
any guests this one is like the ugliest
room here so let's just evacuate so
there we have my house tour
as I said it's nothing too fancy but my
next one will be fancy so stay tuned for
that if you like this video please give
it a big thumbs up because it obviously
helps me out a lot and subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
