sorrow in today's video I'm going to do
a really dramatic look I've got a really
dramatic look in such a long time I'm
just so excited to cake in my face with
some massive lashes on a bold lip I
cannot wait so we're going to do like an
Instagram catfish and makeup look today
I really hope you guys liked this video
and let's go ahead and jump right in I
feel like I look really bold but trust
me I've got a bun back here so let's go
ahead and start with the eyebrows so I'm
taking the benefit kaboom this is the
cream brow gel and I have a shade 3 I've
noticed one so I'm very excited the
color does look really nice a bit more
warm tone than what I actually am but
hopefully we can make it work 30 hate
when you have like a random stray hair
just poking out
oh so it's long so let's and go to town
so if you guys have a nurse already I
got a new background set up I'm still
fiddling around with it so no cuter my
first impression of this product is I
actually love it I love how it's not too
wet the product isn't like too messy so
it's really easy to use and like it's
harder to stuff up because when it's
really wet and just like slippin and
slidin everywhere and I mean my browser
on that they're looking at super dark as
a mermaid but I really need to add some
shape underneath them so I'm going to go
in with concealer and I'm taking the
Smashbox - your skin 24 album proof
concealer in a shade a light neutral I
love this stuff so much I'm just going
to start by putting this on the back of
my hand and to carve out my brows I'm
using the gen Xer Beauty I definer brush
this one is amazing because the brush a
little ellipse the bristles are super
short so it's easy to just like have a
lot of control over the product ok this
concealer isn't the best for carving out
the browser just to realize because it's
so runny and I just need my browser
super soon accidentally so it's just
like oh and of course I'm just going to
prime my eyelids if you're wondering why
I have bruising on my lips that's
because it a little bit of filler in
there are two days ago so sore a bit
fresh there it's swollen as well so
there won't be this big but a little bit
of Rosenberg
and of course setting that down with my
Rimmel stay matte powder I'm just going
to pass this all over my lid so all the
other colors blend on top really nicely
I thought I'm sorry happy so we can
right now so I have two events to go to
this weekend I'm going to a fashion show
type of thing and then I'm going out on
Sunday night we'll probably set it on
out as well um what I haven't really
been out with my friends like a while
I can't wait oh my gosh I'm so excited
for this next product is the Jaclyn hill
palette in collaboration aware that
morphe you guys are going to die when
you see all the colors inside of here oh
it is so beautiful okay so what I really
want to do is put this all over my lid
because I saw one of my favorite gal
pals in YouTube do that the other day
I'm pretty sure I don't know if all
things that color but it looks like it's
color her name's Holly Boone and I'm
like oh I love that I need to do it so I
guess we're gonna start with a
transition shade hmm I'm going to start
with this color right here there's just
so many different shades in here I'm
like what do I do let's go into town so
I'm really excited to see if the formula
is different to other morphe shadows oh
my god oh but it's so pigmented oh I
feel like this is going to be like my
new favorite palette I'm just starting
by taking this in a little circular
motions and buffing it up to my eyebrow
it's really softly though okay so next
I'm going to take this warm doughnut
wave wait a second the next color I'm
taking is this chocolate brown color
right here this is more of a cool tone
but that blue is a cool turn that I want
to put on my lid anyway so I'm just
going to take a little blender brush and
I'm just going to pop this right in my
crease to deepen it up a tiny bit
wholewheat I'm not going in with a cool
turn I'm in a warm Tournament crease so
like me is it now just taking that
original color I'm going to blend on
right over the top just so it's Knossos
smoothly blended you know oh my god now
it's times that amazing blue color I've
honestly never seen anything like this
in
own high life at the mat turquoise green
allelic I'm obsessed that point all over
with let's see if we need some mac fix+
on that I'm set start with a flat shader
brush and just pack it on so pigmented
I'm obsessed would expect nothing less
from Jaclyn hill I'm not going to lie
now I'm just going to blend that goth
ground again into my crease so we can
diffuse that sharp edge right there
let's move on to the rest of the face
over for the primer today I'm taking the
pixie flawless that Beauty primaries
ones are really pretty and iridescent it
makes the skin look so glowy so I'm
taking two bumps and putting that on the
back of it wait what I'm gonna put this
in my face duh what else excuse Shani
my skin is very dull at the moment I
haven't even moisturized that's not
likely I received for micro radiance and
to life back into my skin I've been
helping Michael move houses I've just
been running amuck the past like three
days I'm just so happy to be like
sitting down and talking to you guys
again now it's time for the foundation
so the one I'm taking today is the true
face of Born This Way I love this one so
much I've been using it ever since
it comes out so this has like a really
nice medium to full coverage so it's
perfect for this makeup look because I
want to be a full glam so the shade that
I have today is a warm nude so I
definitely need a lot of show to what I
usually have my 10 is like completely
faded so I'm just going to shake it up
and put a few pumps on the back of my
hair so we can go in and beat this space
so the brush I'm using is the zoeva
wonderful butter brush through this
foundation is available at Mecca if you
guys are from Australia or Too Faced
dot-com oh my god you guys going to be
so happy with this color match aren't
you so they always go really dark so I
can like make my face look more bronzy
so if you guys want to pick up the new
shade you can get them from Too Faced
calm on June the 15th that's when they
come out and you can also get them in
stores and online at Mecca August the
29th I love this foundation because it
is oil free and also has coconut water
in it so it can like help replenish your
skin it has
only other good ingredients which is
really nice to know and then so
concealer I'm taking that same Smashbox
concealer underneath my eyes oh my god I
have the worst dark circles at the
moment why does this keep happening my
god oh my god that's so dark usually
that's like my highlight shade I have to
go with a lighter one that's cook I'm
going to take the shade light neutral
and light medium it feels so weird not
being can like what's happening what is
happening to me because it's winter
honey bothered and then to bake under my
eyes I'm taking me Kat Von D a locket
translucent powder I haven't eaten in a
while I can't remember if I want it but
let's go in with the Beauty Blender and
then to set that down I'm going in with
the Maybelline fit me a matte in polis I
really liked his powder actually it's
not too heavy on the skin oh my god I'm
so happy right now because you can
really see that glow through the powder
still so I'm gonna zoom you guys in so
we can do a lower lash line I'll just
take that blue from outer corner inner
corner I think obviously really feel in
this call what can I say
and of course I'm going to go in with
this really pretty shimmery shade I'm
just going to pop this on my inner
corners
everything else is matte oh my god that
looks exactly like Mac's nylon I love it
even more pigmented to be honest I'm
just going to line my waterline with
this white eyeliner from Stila it's in
the shade alpine and make the appearance
of bigger eyes because I'm a catfish
okay hi and then for mascara I'm taking
the a Revlon dramatic a definition
mascara I'm just going to coat my top
and bottom lashes I'm ready for some
massive massive lashes right now oh my
god that mascara smudge to all live in
my lid so I would not recommend that I
was a disaster but now for lashes I'm
taking these ones from Lily lashes they
are stunning so I'll be right back
lashes are wrong I'm really going to
like pop up in the corner so just glue
all the glories all the best
I used the House of lashes glue but I
really like the look jewelry better I
just don't know how many left and these
lashes are really stiff I start to bend
them but anyways listen watch the
eyebrow
so I totally want to set them down I'm
taking the garbha when Kelly morale gel
I love this stuff if one is just clear
I'm just going to push my brows upwards
to make them look super full just fluffy
that's better I honestly can't do my
makeup without setting my brows anymore
it looks so good I'm going to use a few
new things that I haven't used before so
this one is the it cosmetics contour
palette and I'm picking up this contour
shade and I'm going to go into town
chisel these cheeks out a bit purpose
the shade is great yep super nice and
then for the bronzer I'm going to take
the a Marc Jacobs tantric bronze I
haven't used this one in a really long
time so I'm going to take this Real
Techniques I think it's a blush brush I
think somebody just for my prawns are a
little bit here to warm my face up a bit
I feel like we can't really do too much
with blush because like of the blue on
the lid so I might bring them some runs
up a little bit higher on my cheeks here
and of course around my forehead I'm
just taking that Kat Von D powder and
I'm just going to bake a little bit on
my sideburns burning out going to clean
it up and I'll just brush it straight
off because I don't want to stark white
line but I still want to be nice and
neat I actually love watching people do
this and just look so good oh my gosh
it's time for the highlight going in
with Mac's fix plus of course I'll just
turn my brush across the room actually
tell me Bubba getting on can use a
different one the highlighter that I'm
wearing today is the Too Faced a love
light ray of light highlighter this is
the rose gold color I think I've used
this before I honestly can't even
remember oh my lord
oh my god you sir the flash back in the
room are you kidding and you just imply
from last week
I feel like highlighter just makes
everything come together you feel in a
plan for the liquid lipstick I'm taking
the shade Gemini and mannequin from
which every star and the
going to mix the two shades together I
don't want the lips to be true colorful
but I don't want them to just be less
new because if you like that's boring
the eye look is really fun so let's make
the list fun but not too fun you know of
course I'm going to set my face so I'm
going to take the cat onesie and look at
and makeup setting mist
mmm that smells amazing
actually that's also cucumber what
anyways I really hope you like the
makeup I love how it looks is so glam
and crazy yet so wearable in my eyes um
if I could change anything I probably
just felt like a new lip line but I
always do new lip so I had to change it
up so I love you guys so much it's don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already and I'll see you in my
next video
hmmm what kind of smell was that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
