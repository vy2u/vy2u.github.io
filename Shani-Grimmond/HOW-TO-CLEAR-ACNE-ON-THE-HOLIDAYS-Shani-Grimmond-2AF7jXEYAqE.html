channel sorry in today's video I'm gonna
be running through how I keep my face
relatively clear there's so many things
that I want to talk about so I'm super
excited to share everything with you as
you can see my background is different I
actually cleaned my room yesterday and I
organized everything I got rid of the
makeup that I haven't used in like two
years
and gave it a look I just got rid of
things that I never used so I'm feeling
very stress free right now very relaxed
and I'm happy okay so let's go ahead and
jump into the video there's obviously a
million different reasons why we all get
pimples or acne and it's different for
everyone but I kind of want to cover as
much as I know so for me personally my
biggest thing is hormonal pimples and I
know a lot of you guys experienced that
as well and it's so frustrating because
there's not actually too much you can do
to fix it but there's definitely ways
you can help it there's ways you can
cover it and all of that so yeah these
pimples right here on my chin area all
hormonal pimples and I hate them so much
they just came back after I went off the
pill I went on the pill about three
years ago to stop my pimples and now
that I'm off it that obviously back so
that was just a quick fix it didn't fix
anything for the long run so now I'm
left with this all over again so I used
to have acne when I was in high school
really bad I had all over my cheeks it
just it was horrible I hated it so much
I I'm the type of person that never
really wears makeup unless I'm like
filming a video or if I'm going out to
an event sorry for me to feel like I
need to put makeup on to feel
comfortable it's like very scary to me
because I've always just been like so
carefree so it kind of sucks that this
is happening so I thought it'd be the
best time to fill you guys in on what I
do so before we get into all the talking
I want to demonstrate my skincare
routine because that is very important
to keeping your skin nice and glowy and
healthy even if you guys have oily skin
I would still recommend doing a skincare
routine I know so many of my friends
don't do anything to their face because
they have oily skin and they feel like
it's already moisturized but trust me
you will thank me when you're older if
you start with skincare routine
right now I need to look twice a day so
in the morning and at nighttime and be
super strict with it because your skin
is with you for the rest of your life
and this is all you have first I like to
start with a taking my makeup off if I
have any on for the day so I like to use
my pre Clinton by Dermalogica so I just
put this on the back of my hand and rub
it in all over my face and then rinse it
off but I don't have any makeup on right
now that's just amazing
and then I go in with cleanser and to be
honest I change at my skin care routine
quite a bit just because I have so many
different products and I like to play
around with but I've been using
Dermalogica for a few months now so this
one is the essential cleansing solution
so what I like to do is take like one
pump on the back of my vanity planet
ultimate skin spot if you guys have
watched me for a while you'll know that
I've been using this for quite a while
now and it's the new one I got a pink
one so this one comes with three
different heads so it really depends on
what kind of what she wants so this one
is the daily exfoliant and then we have
the more deep exfoliant and then the one
that I use the most is this one here
which is a silicone one I just like
something really gentle for my face
because I do have quite sensitive skin
and this one just feels the best on my
skin it was like it's like circulating
all the blood around which is like the
best feeling in the world so what I like
to do is I'm gonna take this and put
this one on I like to go in with one
pump of my cleanser and then I just turn
it on and rub it in all over my face I
just wet the brush by the way I have a
ball and water in front of me why don't
you do it in my makeup room because I
always do my skincare routines in the
bathroom I'm like oh right you know I
mean so this one really helps unclog all
of your pores get all that to Brianna
there anything you don't want it's gonna
take out so all of that likes sweat and
makeup and dirt it's really gonna get
nice and deep into the pores and
obviously if you want to get even deeper
if you feel like your skin is really de
going with the exfoliating one that one
works really well oh my god this
honestly feels so good so this prevents
breakouts blackheads all of that nasty
stuff because obviously like really
getting into all of your pores and
cleaning it out so it is cruelty produce
I which is amazing so it comes in this
okay so right here so it's perfect for
traveling I just took it to Sri Lanka
with me and yeah so he's a perfect
condition because in this little
hardshell box this increases blood
circulation on your face so it's gonna
encourage new cells to form on your face
it's gonna be nice and glowy and that is
exactly what I want I love glowing skin
when you have like no makeup on it just
looks very beautiful but if you guys
want to save some money I have a
discount card for seven percent off
which is amazing it's actually super
super affordable so if you guys just
type in SHINee G skin at checkout you
say heaps of money okay so next I like
to go in with my daily at microphone yen
this is from Dermalogica as well this is
a little bit more of like a deep of
cleanser but it's still good for
everyday use so I only do this I would
say everyday I'll say like every second
day or when my skin is feeling like
super dirty because I don't like to go
in with I try not to go overboard with
older products I like to keep it nice
and simple so it's something that's
actually really easy to fuller and it
really easy to stick to but I will show
you guys how I use this one so this
one's a powder form so I like to put a
little bit in my fingers and then all
you have to do is mix a little bit of
water you see it so finely milled so it
should look something like this and then
I just massage this my skin and actually
feels really hydrating as well it turns
into like a really really smooth paste
my skin already feels so good
I think air is literally a life changer
amazing now that I look like a little
bit of an egghead I'm gonna show you
what I do next so at night time I like
to go in with a really thick oil because
my skin is quite dry and I really want
to nourish it hydrate it make sure it is
ready for the next day so I don't do
this in the morning so I always give a
step but this one is the tarte maracuja
oil next step is to go in with my
moisturizer so i waist-train just went
up and i just finish using my
Gemological one so now I'm on to the
touch sha a water cream actually no I've
been using this one on and off for a
quite a bit now I got this one I was in
America so this one is super light and
it smells amazing I've nearly finished
it
hang on so I just like to take a little
bit on my hand and just rub this into my
skin I literally feel like a new person
right now with all this moisture it's
the best feeling okay so obviously it's
really important to moisturize around
your eyes so I take a different one this
one's from Dermalogica as well it is the
stress positive I lift so this one has
like a little I don't know if it's I
think it's magnesium I went through my
facial and she was trying to tell me
what the point of this like silver thing
is I'm pretty sure it's like magnesium
and it cools down under your eyes so it
kind of like deep puffs under there
sorry I just put a little bit of this
under here this is like too meaty just
as important as the moisturizing my
whole face because it's gonna prevent
wrinkles it's gonna happen to the best
of us anyway when I have active
breakouts I like to go in with this
clear start breakout clearing emergency
it's spot fix so this really dries out
the pimples so it's just gonna make sure
it kind of goes down within a day or two
so I just like to dab it on wherever I
have like goose pimples and try and use
different fingers as well as you don't
transfer any of the germs and then I
have a few here that have yucky stuff in
it I know this is so excessive but the
last step that I do is take my Mario
Badescu facial spray with aloe herbs and
rosewater this stuff is so good for
sensitive skin it doesn't ever irritate
my eyes and I go crazy with this stuff
so I do like to do masks as well so I
like to use these ones from glam glow we
have the hydrating treatment and also
the clearing treatment so this is really
good for getting rid of like bacterial
pimples and all of that so these two are
amazing it's also a good idea to see a
professional every now and then as well
because obviously they're going to be
best with telling you what's best for
your skin and what you need for your
skin you could get like peels you could
get needling that's what I'm gonna start
doing hurtfully that's going to make a
difference with all of my acne scarring
and I'm gonna see what they say about my
active pimples as well sir yeah it is
important to see professionals sometimes
just to get some advice because
obviously just using skin care isn't
going to fix your pimples especially if
they're former
if they're bacterial pimples all whack
stress and obviously there's a lot of
ways you can reduce them or get rid of
them so so obviously the most important
thing to keep in your face nice and
clear is what you put inside of your
body so you want to try your best to eat
as well as you can and obviously it's
different for everyone like your skin
reacts differently to different fruit
and all of that when it comes to
breakouts but for me I do get a little
break paths from Dairy so like milk
sometimes chocolate I mean I don't need
that much chocolate so it's not really a
problem but like a lot of milk and all
of that obviously you want to cut down
the sugar you don't want to very crazy
like I do I love my sugar I personally
would very crazy if I cut all of that
out completely so I'm definitely not
willing to do that for my skin but
obviously it is good to limit yourself
and just know when to stop you don't I
mean obviously you guys known to eat a
lot of fruit and veg to make sure it's
nice and fresh I mean I can't talk I
hardly do that but I need to get onto
that ASAP I'm trying to start to eat
healthy but obviously around try and eat
as healthy as you can and obviously
drinking as much water as you can is
very important that's the biggest thing
with my skin I noticed the biggest
difference and I drink a lot of water my
skin is like really glowy and radiant
and healthy looking so definitely drink
or water you can do it and you'll know
if you're not drinking enough water you
know what I mean next step is to
obviously exercise you don't have to do
it every single day I just started at
the gym I'm really penalized so actually
I don't notice when I go into the sauna
on my skin it looks really glowy and
healthy so I'm trying to do that a lot
more and obviously just doing whatever
exercises you feel works for you and I'm
excited to like join the gym and show
you guys what I get up to honestly when
I am stressed my skin goes crazy so if
you are feeling super stress that could
be affecting your skin quite a bit so
make sure you have some time for
yourself to just relax have a nice bath
but if both come in there we'll add a
candle listen to music whatever you need
to do to relax yourself that's what I
love to do anyways guys oh and last type
of colas is to go in with some lip balm
you know lips to look and juicy long
video really nice skin so anyways I
really hurt you guys enjoyed this video
and hopefully you
something new obviously it's different
for everyone when it comes to pimples
there's so many different things that it
could be caused by and there's
definitely lot of things you can do to
help prevent it and all of that
so I really hope you guys have an
amazing day and I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
