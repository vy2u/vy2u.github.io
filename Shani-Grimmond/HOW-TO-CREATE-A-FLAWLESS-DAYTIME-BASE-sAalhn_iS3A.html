channel so in today's video I'm going to
be showing you how to create a perfect
flawless pace for the daytime from about
hours off my nose hello the first step
to making your skin look super flawless
and also feeling really soft is primer
so I'm going to take the clean slate
timeless smoothing primer by its heart
it just comes with a little pot right
here at honestly makes my face feel like
a baby's bum so I'm just going to work
this into my skin and I usually focus it
on the middle part of my face
also make sure you moisturize your face
before you apply any makeup consider as
it makes the foundation everything like
going so much easier and it hydrates the
skin I'm just going to put a little bit
of the Smashbox photo finish primer
water over the top you obviously don't
need to go in with two primers but it's
just make my face feel so hydrated so
I'm just going to do a few scores mmm oh
now let's move on to the foundation so
if you guys have been watching me for a
really long time and you probably know
that doesn't mean that one of my
favorite foundations are so incredibly
long it is the Too Faced Born This Way
it is oil free and it has so many good
ingredients and that a really replenish
your skin and just make it look amazing
so I'm in a shade warm beige I'm just
going to this is actually a new one I'm
just going to put a few pumps on the
back of my hand so we can work it into
the skin and I find it best to apply
more liquidy foundations with a Beauty
Blender and then sticker foundations
with a like stippling brush something
more like this one right here but
because this one's run a liquidy side
I'm going to play it with the Beauty
Blender and this one is a new one we're
going to it's so clean not long I'm just
going to put three pumps on the back of
my hand this foundation has amazing
coverage you can make it lighter if you
want but I like more of a full coverage
anyway so that's what I build it up to
be it is also oil free and it has Alpine
roses it to help like brighten the skin
and make it look more radiant I'm
honestly obsessed with this foundation
so they actually came out with a six new
shed which is so incredible but this
shade I'm wearing right now is the one
that I've been using ever since it came
out because it is the perfect shade for
me when I have a fake tan on but I will
be using
the other shades when I have a dark
speck town so excited it makes me so
happy when brands come out with more
shades so then obviously the Kincaid up
for every single skin tone that's how it
should be there the new six shades will
be launching on to Facebook come on June
the 15th and in stores and online at
Mecca on August 29 who else is excited
now it's time for the concealer so I'm
taking the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer
in the shade warm ivory sir I'm taking
one that has like more of a peachy
undertone in there so I can really
cancel out all those like perfectly blue
turns under there because it is the
other color on the color wheel so again
I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender
and it dipped the tip of this in and
just like put it all well I just like
jabbed in this so I'm just going to put
this really close up to the inner
corners because I will use a different
concealer later to brighten under here
as well so now that I have the corrector
under my eyes on this side you can see
how bad deciders oh my gosh this is
weird so I got more of the two-faced
concealers as well I'm just trying to
figure out what qualities I think I'm
going to use a shade light/medium it's
not true bright but it's still like
really good for daytime so it's like
time to be like working a 2001 next
favorite brands and then Kyle odd so I'm
just going to put a little bit of this
right under here so it can make this
color blend in to one and also done my
nose as well so just so lending the skin
with my Beauty Blender again oh yeah
harness knit now my base is completely
flawless so now we need to go in and set
everything down to make sure it's not
going to budge throughout the day or
like crease under the eyes or anything
like that so what I always do and it's
completely up to you if you want to do
this is fake underneath my eyes some
people don't like to bake because it
mixed under the eye so you're really
stiff and the wrinkles do show off a
little bit more but I feel like it's so
worth it because the concealer like
won't move at all the translucent powder
that I'm using today is the makeup cedar
translucent powder in extra fine and one
so before you bank your to make sure
there's literally no creases under the
so just quickly blended out one last
time before you apply it otherwise if
you set it with a crease down the crease
it's going to be there all day so just
putting about this much on my the yoda
blender and I'm just going to top this
into the skin this one pretty much just
like melts into the skin like I feel
like I don't really need to wipe it off
the ladder and then just at the rest of
my face I'm taking the benefit of a
little little benefit hello flawless in
the shade at champagne this is on my
Holy Grail powder as well adds a little
tiny bit of extra coverage and it sets
everything down at the same time so I'm
just going to press this into the skin I
don't like to flash it around otherwise
the foundation is going to move so just
be very gentle not only putting a little
bit on as well because obviously we do
have enough coverage going on and don't
forget to blend the foundation and
powder down your neck as well so it is
like all one color may I rather so I'm
even all the time why does this happen
to me
nothing mm-hmm now it is time for the
contouring so in the daytime I like to
keep my contouring to a minimum which
I'm sure you think sounds really good
because if this in my last few videos my
contouring has been like so creepy like
it needs to calm down a bit so I'm going
to take the balm Bahama Mama or runs out
or contour or whatever you want to call
it this one is very cool turn so I'm
going to keep it a very very light
handed I'm going to tap the back of my
brush off I meant my brush one more and
then I'm just going to put this right
underneath my cheekbones make it a
little more defined for bronzer you can
obviously use whatever you want but I
just got a new one and I really really
like this one from the brand girl on who
go on my bag and it's in the shade
terracotta 0-3 natural brunette so this
is what it looks like right here this is
more unlike the orange side that's just
what I like so I'm just going to take an
angled brush and put that where I put
the contour shade but just bring it up a
little bit higher I also like to take
this up along my hairline as well but as
you can see it just adds a really nice
flushes color to the face just makes it
look so much more healthy so I'm putting
this around my jawline as well wait
I am going later on my runs off my bad
okay so now let's move on to cleaning up
the bronze I'm making a little sharper
if you have mucked up and gone through
fine this is the perfect step so what
I'm going to do is take my Rimmel stay
matte powder and I'm going to use this
to bake so if you're on a budget this is
perfect otherwise you can just bake with
a normal translucent powder which is
super easy as well so just taking my
blender I'm just going to Pat that on my
powder and then derive this underneath
my contour you can use your normal
powder that you use to put the rest of
your face if you want but this is just a
little bit lighter so it adds even more
definition it's what I love and then
with my powder brush I'm just going to
run this in little circles to brush off
any excess powder the next step is blush
and this is going to add a really nice
flush of color to the face that makes
the face look so much more healthy and
radiant
so the blush that I'm taking today is
from Jordana and this one's in a shade
32 a rose silk these women are just a
bit of a bindi like beautiful cabinet so
this one is like super silky and really
great quality and it is drugstore which
is amazing I'm just trying to find a
brush to use but I washed all my brushes
last night so that all wet except like
ten of them working with what I've got
I think I might just use the brush of
they use to apply bronzer I'm just going
to place this on the apples of my cheeks
and then blend it backwards
we have carbonated the fly in here ack
ack ack ack ack alright I think the
blush just took over the bronzer look
stunning
now for the highlighter one of my
favorite part so this one is from Becca
and it's in the shade press the creep up
Michael was taking the pr70 for saying
this wrong I don't even care okay but I
really like these Becca highlight
because they're really finely milled so
they look so nice on the skin that it
looked chalky at all but at the same
time they're still very very intense so
I'm going to start by taking my mac fix+
it just makes it so much more intense
and just like silky on the skin like
less powder because it is like water I'm
just going to spray this on my a 23
brush by Anastasio this is seriously the
best highlighting brush in the world
like I don't know what she's ready
pull out up like white you win see what
I mean it's like so intense but it's
just so like silky soft looking on the
skin I'm also putting a bit on my nose
as well make it look a little smaller in
patina and lastly a little bit on my
forehead to add a bit more of a glow so
because this is for a daytime look even
though if it wasn't that time we could
probably just add like a bit more
bronzer a bit more concealer um I'm not
going to do false lashes I'm just going
to curl them to make them a little extra
longer girl obviously this has nothing
to do with a face but I love this
mascara so much as you see at Bobby
Brown smoky eye mascara helping a lot of
this in my lashes and then we're doing a
lips and then I'm done lastly I'm going
to do my lips I'm using this new XO at
beauty lipstick this is like one of the
lightest shades in there the color looks
amazing it might be a little true light
for me just because I do have a bit of a
10 on now but this one is a cream
formula I really want to see how it goes
oh my god that's so pigmented
okay this is definitely going to be true
like for me sir I'm going to use this as
like an ombre and I'm going to get the
other shade that I want to use my
computer eat it oh my god it was right
in front of me I've honestly like never
felt a formula like this one it's very
matte like it's not sticky but it feels
so smooth it just feels like so
moisturizing but it's really mad at the
same time I don't know how that works
but let's go in with the LAT paint in
the middle level umbrella you guys move
it yay good job shadow these are really
pretty and they feel so comfortable on
the lips so now let's go in and set the
face I'm going to take the Urban Decay
Edgehill makeup setting spray this one
is in cooling and hydrating but if you
do have like oily skin there's like oil
control ones and stuff so I guess it
really just depends on your skin type
give it a good shake and I'm just gonna
spritz like for praising my face so that
people it's not a fat one I might just
for a little bit of a gloss on my lips
but I'm feeling like today we officially
have a finished to makeup look so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
