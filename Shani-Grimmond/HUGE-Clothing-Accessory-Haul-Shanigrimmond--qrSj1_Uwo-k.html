and welcome to my room this is the first
video where I've showed my whole room in
the background so I hope you guys like
it and so yeah this video is going to be
a haul so I'll be showing you some
clothes that I've picked up from so many
different companies and also some
accessories like bags and wallets and
Sony's and everything I'm so excited to
be doing this video because I haven't
done like a chatty video in quite some
time because I've been focusing on
makeup tutorials and hair tutorials and
I've been doing voiceovers so here I am
talking to the camera so let's get
started okay so the first shot that I
want to talk about is dress linked calm
and they have so many so many cheap
clothes such poor quality I am obsessed
with just like calm 10 out of 10 so the
first thing that I got from there is
this jumper right here and this was $38
and I got this for winter here in
Australia it's getting really cold so it
has this fur inside and it keeps you so
warm and it's just this like khaki green
kind of color and that's so in in this
winter here in Australia because so many
people have been wearing it sounds like
what the perfect time to pick up this
jump off the next thing that I got from
dresslink comm is this plays are right
here this was only 16 dollars and I
think it's so cute and the main reasons
why I bought this is because it has a
little shoulder pads and it makes your
shoulders look so cute and I just love
jean pants so much and also I got it
because I'm doing a work makeup tutorial
and like outfit and hair and everything
so that's why I was inspired to get this
and it has two little fake pockets here
and you can clip it up at this part
right here next thing I have to show you
guys is this maxi dress right here it is
stunning it is really long it goes to my
ankles which is good because most
dresses don't go to my ankles because I
have really long legs so I love this it
comes in black and it comes in red and I
Tracy at the red because I think it's
gorgeous and I love red dresses sorry
this is the back of the dress right here
it is kind of backless it has two straps
that go like that and then it zips up
right down here so it's pretty low which
is my favorite part about it because I
love backless dresses next thing I got
and these Sunday's right here and these
were only four dollars I think that is
so cheap probably the cheapest sunnies
that I've got that are actually nice I
literally love these and I also want the
black pair but my sister took them so I
can't really show
and then the next thing that I've got
are these nipple silicone pads and they
look like this and all you do when
you're wearing backless clothing as I
said I love backless clothing all you
have to do is stick these on your nips
and you're right to go so the last thing
that I got from dresslink comm is this
little cosmetics bag right here and you
can put your makeup in it you can put
anything you want in it but I'm actually
going to use this for my pencil case at
school because my pencil case that I
have now is so dodgy so all you do you
open it and it has like a little animal
print inside and this was only three
dollars and it's such cool cloudy so
hello the next door is princess Polycom
i won and how to look at their online
store and they have phenomenal clothing
it's so this is what I picked up and
this was $70 it is so pretty it's just a
really nice blue jumpsuit and it is also
backless the material is super thin so
it is perfect for summer if you guys are
in the u.s. you you're in someone now I
think this would honestly be perfect and
I just love it and if you guys saw the
Instagram that I posted the Instagram at
posts that I posted then you would see
how pretty this is on with a 10 it's
just on point the next thing is also
from princess Polly and it is this dress
right here it's just a black maxi but
the best thing about it is that the ends
of the board the bottom of the dress is
like really sheer and it has this
gorgeous pattern on it I don't think you
can see it right now but you'll be able
to see it when it's on oh look at that
and yeah it's backless as well so it
goes all the way down to the back of
your undies like you are gonna see on
dudes but it goes all the way down there
so this is literally probably the
prettiest dress that I have ever got in
my life it is stunning
the next thing that I picked up is from
Jada blue calm and they have amazing
clothes in there it's just like all
these popular trending clothes that are
sold for really cheap and this is the
dress right here this spread is white
closet so white closet is sold at so
many different places but this is the
cheapest website that I found that sold
my closet so I love this it's just a
strappy drew our short dress is pretty
sure which is what I like in my dresses
and it has like a leather sleeves which
are just beautiful and yeah I just love
this dress it's so easy just Chuck this
on and it's so versatile you could wear
it out on a night out I think if you put
like a chunky gold chain and some
heels or you can work for some booze I
also got this top right here from jana
blue as well it is so pretty and it is
so so comfortable and it's like really
fluffy so keep me nice and warm this is
great for winter because it comes up
quite high on the neck and you could
also wear this for summer because it is
a crop top it is quite short but in the
winter time I'm going to be pairing it
with summer high-waisted jeans the next
thing I have wanted for the longest time
it's from choice calm I think that's how
you pronounce I'm not quite sure so this
is what it looks like here it's just a
coat and it is so pretty I love the
color it's just like a simple beige
color you can wear it with anything
that's why I picked out this color and
it has all these gold buttons down here
and then you just tie up this around the
stomach I also got this head piece from
choice calm and it was $12 which is
really cheap everything that I've got in
this haul is quite cheap to be honest so
excuse that so yeah I just think it's
gorgeous it has this bit that goes down
in the middle of your hair so you're
just PI it down the middle and it sits
on the part of your hair and then it has
blue little rhinestones all around it
and it has the gold chains and I think
it's amazing okay so the next shop is
might of China calm it is so so cheap
once again this is what it looks like he
writes just a cardigan a bit of a greeny
brown color and yeah I just love it I
think it's so pretty and simple the next
thing that I got from Mart of China is
this sweater right here it is so pretty
and it's kind of unique because it
doesn't have the holes here it has the
arm holes right there
so put your little hands out there I
think it's just so cute and then it has
a little flappy thing that connects over
the neck right here and then it has the
hole at the back so if you don't want
the flappy thing all you have to do is
take it off and you've got yourself a
brand new sweater so if you guys watch
my other videos and you probably know
that I have a weird obsession with
earrings like dangly earrings so I also
got these cute little ones here these
were $7 they have like the white little
tassels at the bottom and it's all gold
and it has a little diamond T little
things right there I'm not trying to
snap for this as fast as I can because I
feel like this video is going to be gone
forever
so the next three things that I've got
are the same but different color and I
got them from the factory Kong for $15
each so they look like this they have
like a little pillow pattern I don't
know
look at it it reminds me of like a
pillow because it looks really
comfortable and I just love it so it's
like a crop top oversized crop top and I
just love it so I got gray I got the
white one which was stunning and also I
had to get a black one they only had
three colors and I picked up all of them
because I love oversized crop top so
that is all for the clothes now let's
move onto the accessories and the first
thing that I got is from Colette of
course I love call it her stunning
jewelry and bags ever sorry this is what
the necklace looks like right here it's
just a gold choker chain I actually
didn't think it was a choker because it
sits like right up here but I thought it
was gonna be sitting like down there
which is fun and I'm still gonna wear it
it's so pretty and it was like
half-price so why not if you guys have
watched my other video you would have
seen this a hundred times and in my
Instagram photos but this is the
necklace that I also picked up from
Colette I love wearing this with black
because it just adds a gorgeous pop of
color and the next thing are these
earrings from Colette as well they are
just big gold hoops with little gold
diamond tears on them I just think
they're so cute and they're kind of
heavy so make sure you get used to them
before you wear them out and the last
set of earrings are these ones right
here from Colette as well I just think
they gorgeous they have like a little
clover lookin leaf up there and they
have like a little droplet speaking of a
pop of color added to an outfit this
would be perfect for that it is just a
gold clutch from color as well notice a
gold clutch I'm in red clutch with a
gold piece of metal down there for some
extra spiciness I also got this little
head jewel from Zara clip hair
extensions calm it is so pretty
so it's just a little head piece that
you put right there and you clip in the
bobby pins up here and just sits in so
securely securely it's not a word I'm
not quite sure anyways I think it's the
cutest thing ever and I just wanted to
tell you guys where I got it from
because a lot of people were asking me
where I got it from my last video so the
last shot that I had to talk about is
called me two bags comm and basically
what that is is a online store that
sells replicas of Louie Vuitton Michael
Kors all of these really huge brands for
like really cheap prices so they're fake
products basically so the first thing
that I got are these high heels and
these were $49 and these are the
knockoffs of the real versions of the
your fees and not that law I have no
idea how to pronounce that but I'll have
it listed down below so Italy so they
look like this and they have their green
platform the yellow toe it beige up here
and the orange here you guys can see it
but I just thought I'd tell you anyway I
also got this wallet from at me two bags
calm it is stunning it is a knockoff of
the Michael Kors wallet and it's the one
that zips around like this so it's super
easy and I've got all my cosmetic cuz
I've been using this at the moment
because I love it it is quite full which
is handy the next thing that I got are
these sunglasses right here they just
look like a classic pair of the black
sunglasses and I love the shape they're
really unique
they look like this I just think they
are so so pretty but not with the
headpiece because they kind of clash
yeah but yeah I just love these
sunglasses I'll be wearing them a lot
and if the packaging was amazing they
came in this box right here that says
Tom Ford and then you open it and it
came in this little sunglass holder that
says Tom Ford there as well and you open
it up and they're nice and secure when
you are traveling so me two bags calm is
phenomenal I love their customer service
and shipping and lovable everything like
that was definitely a 10 out of 10
I thought to come up inside body guys up
close and personal so I really hope you
