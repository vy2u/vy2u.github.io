being so perfect hey guys it's Shawnee
and welcome to my channel so in today's
video I'm doing a Clube haul wow that
did work my chair doesn't spin properly
sorry I'm also gonna be sharing with you
some makeup that I've picked up some
bags some shoes accessories everything I
have everything today so this is going
to be a collective haul some things that
I've picked up over the last month or so
so let's just go ahead and get started I
think this video is gonna be long so
let's start with the first shop and that
is Shane sicom I've got a little bit
carried away on there the first thing
that I picked up these Sunny's I've been
seeing these everywhere and I thought
that was about time that I picked them
up I don't know how flattering thing
looks on me I always get studies that
look like make me look like a bug I
don't know why I think this so cute
though I also picked up some white linen
pants and they look like this that's
super comfortable and really good
quality and I love how they have little
rips down the side to add some more snug
little into them I don't have any white
ones so I thought it was about time that
I added some into my collection and I'm
going to be wearing these probably like
every second day I'm kind of just
sucking when it comes to knitted
sweaters so I picked up one it's like a
beige color and it's really thin so
hopefully I can get away with rowing it
and spring maybe on like a cold night or
something I don't know I couldn't pass
this up even not starting to get really
hot I think this would be great for all
of you in the US and UK it is lovely and
it goes past your vajayjay and your buns
so you can wear them with tights without
having like a camel toe TMI yeah I
finally picked up a really long cardigan
it goes past my knees and up to my elbow
so it's like the perfect cardigan the
jump suits that I'm about to show you
are so beautiful you're probably gonna
pass out and fall off your chair or off
your bed right now I'm curious oh that
didn't even work because it fell for
Kurt hang-up tada I think they are
seriously so gorgeous especially the top
part of them I think the life is just so
flattering and really thick materials so
honey yes please and they're only twenty
dollars the last thing that I got from
shades side is this top that I'm wearing
right now it is a crop top and it has
lace material all over it it is so
gorgeous and comfortable and it's
perfect for spring because it
nothing short can I get a seriously
though it is gorgeous so I went to the
meat pimp sale while I was in Sydney and
the first thing that I picked up from
better is this high-waisted pant this
brand is hot no more I believe these
were like originally 80 or 90 dollars
and I went down to 30 and I'm like give
it to me burger I also picked up this
yellow leather high-waisted skirt I
wanted something to add it to my closet
that was really bright and vibrant for
the springtime so I thought this would
be perfect this is the brand painted red
and it was only five dollars and I'm
like yes please because panet red is
usually a very expensive brand
underneath it into brands I don't even
know why I said that I also picked up
this black knit and crop and this is the
brand's staple I just realized that like
my whole closet is basically filled with
staple so I'm pretty sure that's my fav
brand it is just like a very basic sheer
knitted sweater it's a sweater knitted
sweater yeah I also did a little bit of
shopping on toluca boutique and this is
the first little thing that I got here
it's a very sheer kind of mesh material
and I'm digging it I'm really digging
like this year fabrics this month I also
got this great sweater I valannus 100
times already I work with my hosted
pants and it's just so comfortable like
can we get real and he added like a
little neck place with it and it dresses
it up so yeah and now time for the
things that I got from princess Polly I
did a lot of online shopping and also in
the store
viciously one of my favorite boutiques
of life so the first thing that I got is
this mid crop right here
I love the straps on it it's really thin
and this is like perfect for spring and
summer just wear this with high waisted
pants even with those white ones that I
showed you before well I also got this
top right here and this is the brand of
Finders Keepers it has a really low cut
on the side so it kind of reminds me of
like a muscle tee it is so comfortable
the material is really thin but it's so
soft
I feel literally wear this to bed but
it's too cute for that next thing is
this jumpsuit this is probably my
favorite thing that I have in my closet
at the moment it is the most flattering
jumpsuit I've ever seen the print on it
is gorgeous the materia
is so thick and it's actually really
secure around the boob area which is
hard to find when you have like a really
low v-neck so obsessed I can't wait to
wear this I already wanted a photo
advise it wear it out
so doesn't count the last clothing item
that I picked up from princess Polly are
these high-waisted jeans right here they
are really dark wash of blue they're the
brand nobody and they fit absolutely
perfectly they're just like so snug
around my butt and actually making a mat
look pretty nice as well so thank you
there were $200 and I was like who pays
$200 for high-waisted jeans I do because
they have lost me Fred bought that such
cool quality oh wait I lied there is
more things from princess Polly I also
picked up at this bag I've been using it
ever since I actually got it because
it's like the most basic bag and it goes
with everything and it's just so you
like classy it might be of like a
business bag and it's the one that hangs
over your shoulder so it goes down to
your bum and you don't have to worry
about putting it right here that really
grinds like it is because you have to
hold your arm like this the whole day
but one of these you can just put it
over your shoulder and stroll along
Sonny's time I have a really bad
addiction with Sonny's well I wouldn't
call it an addiction but like an
obsession is that bad so the first pair
from City Beach and they're kind of like
Leopard and I just think ring light I
just think that's so classy and I was
like come to me come to mama I also got
these ones that needs the brand new meet
pink
hello ha with session with bunnies I
know the next pair are these and basic
black ones I think these kind of Sunny's
can go with every single outfit what and
I also got these ones are right here and
these are kind of like a pinky
translucent color and I don't have
anything like this most of my studies
are black so I thought it was about time
that these came into my collection so a
few days ago I went to Colette and it
was so hard not to spend like $3,000 I'm
not even kidding you they have so many
nice bags and wallets and jewelry so I
just held myself back and got true
things so the first thing well it's just
like a pack of three so that counts is
one thing right so this is the first set
of earrings that these ones and then
diamonds and pearls which I'm obsessed
with they're like the basic earrings you
can wear all the time and I also got
this necklace right here this is
gorgeous it has it lots of different
like beading going on it's very unique I
mean I don't have anything like this it
dresses up every single top or dress up
every single outfit because it has so
much going on so I thought it'd be
perfect for me because since I have
summery basic clothes this will give me
some justice
moving on to some perfumes I picked up
the Nicole Richie one and at least half
of it already this is the most beautiful
perfume I have ever bought in my life it
was like $90 but I went down just 60 and
I think six dollars is still pricier for
a little perfume but it smells like
absolute heaven oh my god speaking of
perfumes I got this little perfume
container it is called at the traveler
I'm sure you guys have heard of it but
it's basically like a little perfume
container kind of thing so basically you
pump it in and then you can take it
while you're traveling so I take this to
school when I go out anywhere and I was
like mmm it comes in handy look and I
also got this Victoria's Secret coconut
passion vanilla and coconut fragrant
mist that's a very long name this smells
like summer in a bottle it has a very
strong coconut smell it reminds me a lot
of people on ice and tanning foam and
also oh what's a cool just like the
tanning oil that you put all of you it
smells literally like summer in a bottle
so I was like what better way to like
enjoy summoners smell like summer
speaking of tans I stocked up on my
Bondi sands hermit rhymes so I got these
self-tanning a spray mist this is what I
used to turn my face I don't like using
the foam put my face because then it
kind of transfers when you use the mitt
blah blah my life I've read talked about
like 100 times before and I also got the
self-tanning lotion in dark and also the
everyday gradual tanning milk I haven't
tried these out but I'll let you know
what I think of them soon so now time
for some makeup I picked up some lime
crime lipsticks I am freaking it love
every single lone crime lipstick and
they have out there definitely one of my
favorite brands sorry the first one is
in the shade Jared I have no idea but
it's kind of like a coral a pink shade I
don't really have too many Pink's in my
collection so I thought I should start
stocking up since it is coming up to
spring and
summer because pics are like the perfect
shade for that season I also got CRO
Tesla fluorescent I know that somehow
saying I'm just trying and then this is
like a Barbie pink shade oh my god this
is my favorite one ever this is
literally my holy grail lipstick it is
any shade
can you guess pause this video and go
write down what you think this is this
isn't a shade Coquette it is my new holy
grail lipstick it is a such a beautiful
formula it is so pigmented and creamy
and literally go by that if you love
nudes well the next one is this shade a
great pink planet this is probably my
favorite pink that I have I don't really
wear pink too much but this is so
flattering and I think only using that a
lot this month well this spring time for
some all of Lancome products I got full
Belva teens these are one of my favorite
formulas when it comes to lip products
the first color is in the shade wicked
it is a very nice with very maroon color
I had this in my last tutorial it is
it's such a stunning product oh my lord
the next one is in the shade at pink
velvet it is just a classic pink color
this is very similar to one of the
lipsticks I just showed you or well the
next one is me shade it sued berry oh I
don't know if I'd say pronounce it but
this is a Carlene red color I was
writing this when I was showing off my
new teeth so there's your answer to
everyone that was asking the last one is
they said utopia it's just a really nice
pinky purple shade this is actually what
I'm wearing on my lips today it is
beautiful and I needed it in my life so
I did I got it and I also got some lime
crime eye line is I'm actually wearing
the tough one on my lids
today it is sorry creamy pigmented can
we be real for a second it is so milky
the consistency is like 10 out of 10 I
also bought two big sticks from Mac and
the first one is in the shade and
laurainge it looks like that it is a
really nice curly red color I have one
of this for quite a while now it sounds
like stuff this I'm just gonna go get it
and the next color even the shade Q is
then this is so similar to the LAN crime
in the shade croquette like literally it
was that same well exact but really
really close
you know Michael fair as well next is
this Mac lip pencil in the shade spice
this is very
similar to the Mac lip pencil in the
shade it's stripped-down I just wanted
this to make my lips appear a lot bigger
because it's a very neutral color like
very so much my lips just a few shades
darker and I also got this nice lip
gloss in the shade at Turkish delight
I've heard 1000 people talk about this
I'm just like whatever I'm just gonna
get it if they really know that fairy
floss like baby kind of pink and it's
gorgeous next thing I got is this
telescopic L'Oreal extra black mascara
