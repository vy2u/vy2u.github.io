today I have a humongous haul I have a
lot of haircare products a few makeup
items I have bikinis and Sony's and
clothes and all of that good stuff so I
really hope you guys enjoy this video
and let's jump into it just quickly I
want to say that everything that I'm
mentioning in this video I will have
listed down below and I will try my best
to find the links to everything that I
have so the first thing is from V Queen
and there's this black and white blazer
and I was going to be doing a work make
up an outfit video that's why I got this
one it is just a cotton blazer and it
has little colors right here in a super
comfy and light so I just thought this
would be perfect for winter I also
picked up a monochrome cardigan it looks
like this it is very thin so it is
extremely comfortable I was going to
include this into the work video as well
because it is very work appropriate and
what I love about it is that it ties up
around the waist so it is very
flattering on a lot of body types and
when I wore it last week to the shops a
few people are saying to me that it
looks like the David Jones logo I wasn't
aware that this is the David Jones logo
but I actually did get that from quite a
few people so that's quite interesting
and the last thing that I got from wear
queen is this black blazer and I love
how it has the collar down the side here
just adds a bit more pizazz 'el and it
also has the rose gold buttons on the
sleeve which is really nice so again I
was going to be adding this in the work
video so it is extremely a work
appropriate as I've said twice now so
yeah I've been really liking that the
next few things are from Shayne sicom
I'm not very sure if that's how you
pronounce it correct meet your favorite
wrong but the first thing that I got is
this black maxi dress right here this is
extremely long and heavy which is always
good and this is backless as well and I
love backless dresses and the other
thing that I love about it is that it
has like really thin spaghetti straps I
don't have anything that has thin straps
I just think thin straps are extremely
flattering and I also picked up that
same dress in a different color I got
this peachy kind of a salmon color I
wasn't quite sure what when I would like
better and there were only like $20 or
something so I thought why not get them
both and the next thing that I picked up
is is this a black jacket I really like
this because it has a lot of different
materials on it so it has leather on the
sleeves and then it has like this cotton
II kind of feel on the front of it and I
have
just gone super and a few God buttons on
it and the reason why I got this is
because it is it for raising in
Australia and I don't really have too
many um what am I saying right now oh
yeah I don't have too many jumpers that
are really dressy that I can actually
wear out so I thought this would be
perfect because this is very dressy and
I can actually wear this outside of my
house
I also picked up this creamy white
colored wallet and it says cram smart
with a gold little crown on it I really
lack simple while it's just because they
like match every outfit so when you open
it up there's like a little card
compartment and also a low compartment
for coins which is all I need in a
wallet I also picked up another wallet
wallet No so I had clutched a small
clutching bag kind of thing I don't know
but I got this to put my tampons and
pads in because I like to put them in a
little compacted bag so they're not
floating around in my schoolbag so this
does have like a snakeskin feel to the
top and at the back and it also has like
a beige little bottom with little
tassels on the Zippy thing so I really
like this I think it is so adorable I
also picked up a few little head pieces
or head jewels I'm not quite sure what
they're called
the first one that looks like this it
has little leaves hanging from an N Gold
dime aunty's with a gold chain I think
it's just completely adorable and the
next one is just gold leaves it's
tangled it looks like this whoa okay
then that's really not working out for
me but I think this is really pretty
especially when you have your hair down
low you can just get your hair out of
your face and it just look nice and
savvy so that is super cute now time for
the bikinis and it's sunny so these are
all from a lovely wholesale and this is
what the first bikini set looks like I
really like this because it's
fluorescent and I don't really have too
many colors in my bikini collection so I
thought this would be nice to pick up
and this is what the bottoms look like
voila the right way yeah and it has
little cutouts on this side as well so I
think that's quite unique I also picked
up about three pairs of black bikinis so
the first set looks like this it has the
little cutouts on the side
could you imagine the turn that you
would actually get with these that would
be crazy
and then the bottoms have these straps
on these side as well like the little
cutouts again gorgeous turn so this is
what the next set looks like it is just
a standard black bikini I really like
the
it's just simple and what you could wear
all the time without being kind of too
obvious of you wearing the same bikini I
like how it has it three straps at the
top and then the bottoms have at three
straps as well I don't even know why I
got bikinis when it is winter oh well
anyways moving on the last pair that I
got is this black simple pair once again
and it has the little straps at the
bottom which is nice because it adds
something a little different and then
the bottoms are just plain back bottoms
so these are the studies that I got from
lovely wholesale I really like these I
kind of feel like I look like Jenna of
Pretty Little Liars from the side
because they're so darkly tinted I
actually really like these though so the
next pair looks like this it has kind of
like the blue metallic lens in there I
think this is really like retro and
unique looking I got these so I could
actually put them on my head because I
think it looks really cute I probably
wouldn't wear them like this because I
was like a bug what do you guys think
and I also picked up two more pairs of
sunglasses so this is what the next pan
looks like I like these ones because it
has the little gold jangling bits and I
have crooked ears so it's very hard to
get away with wearing Sony's but I still
keep buying them for some reason so
let's see what this look like well girl
I think that cute and then the last pair
look a little bit funny on me I actually
don't think they suit me but I really
like the look of them when they're not
actually on so I'll probably just wear
them off on my head I just don't I don't
know do you guys like them I don't know
how I feel so the next three things are
from choice comm I have no idea how to
pronounce anything I suck at
pronunciation so I got another pair of
sunglasses again weird obsession they
look like this on they have a goal a
little bit in the middle and then gold
detailing on the side which is really
cute I love gold it looks funny because
of the ring light so I kind of have a
weird obsession with head pieces at the
moment so I got two more this is what
the first one looks like I think it is
so nice this bit goes in the middle it's
so hard to try it on right now because
it's just not working but I think it is
stunning it is super unique to all the
other ones that I have so I really like
this one this is what the last headpiece
looks like I think this is it's so
stunning
I really like headpieces for some reason
I just think they're so cute I just
added like a bit more jazz to the hair
just doesn't look so plain because I do
have a really plain a hair color it's
just very boring so this is just a gold
chain and it has a little hand symbol on
there I guess I don't know is that a
hand it has like it has five fingers but
it kind of looks like demented and then
it has a little blue stone in the middle
so I think this is just adorable and
they also picked up another pair of
sunnies these are like the other ones
that I showed you guys before but it has
like an a yellowy orange lens in it I
was wearing this in my Instagram photos
and a lot of people asking where they're
from so I will have the link down below
and this is what the in boots look like
that I picked up they have a pointed
little toe and then they have a heel I
don't have any pointed toe shoes so I
thought I'd just step outside of my
comfort zone Jesus and try something new
I think these are really feminine and
girly looking with a little bit of
grungy edge if you know what I mean I
just like them a lot I think they're
cute and now moving on to makeup I
picked up a few lipsticks and lipglosses
from rapture boutique which is one of my
favorite clothing boutiques as well so
the first lipstick I got isn't a shade
at glamour I don't even know how to
describe this is kind of like a dark
berry shade but if it is it okay really
it is extremely unique I don't have any
shade like this so I think that is
really nice to have in my collection and
the next one isn't a shade at retro
futurist a really unique red shade as
well I don't have a red like this it is
extremely different to the others so I
think Lancome does have extremely unique
shades and I also got two Lancome lip
glosses as well the first one is in the
shade cherry on top which is just like a
light red where's little glitters in it
and the other one is in the shade at
candy apple which is a dark red with a
lot of glitter on it which is very
different I don't have any lip glosses
that have glitter in it so I'm actually
excited to try these out I also got a
few fake eyelashes these are from
Benefit I've actually never tried any of
the benefit eyelashes before except for
like ten minutes ago I tried to put
these on but for some reason the band is
extremely extremely thick so it was
really hard to stick down to my lash
for some reason I don't know why if any
of you guys have that problem please let
me know in the comments below and the
next brand that I got is from red cherry
I got like 10 pairs for $20 off eBay
these are my favorite lashes of all time
I think eBay is like the cheapest place
you can get them if you guys can find
them anywhere Qi bar is like 250 each
then please let me know as well I just
love to buy lashes and my cherry lashes
are just to die for
I'm actually so excited about these
lashes I got the Ascari lashes and this
one is in amp it up this is just like an
extremely feathery long looking lash I
really like the packaging as well I
think it is stunning and I also got
unforgettable and voila lash I also got
a few things from a benefit cosmetics
the first thing is this is potent eye
cream I was actually really hesitant
about buying this because it is such a
small tub for $42 here in Australia and
this is my first item this is the first
eye cream that I have tried and I'm
actually extremely impressed it's
definitely worth the money in my opinion
it just makes my under eyes feel
extremely hydrated and it gets rid of
the fine lines well it doesn't get rid
of them but it just kind of makes them
appear less vibrant I guess I'm not
quite sure how to describe that and I
also got the total moisture facial cream
this one is extremely bigger than the
eye cream so I'm very impressed with
that and this is just like my favorite
favorite moisturizer of all time at the
moment this has just been like my Savior
because my skin has been so dry like
it's ridiculous I totally forgot to put
this in the makeup part of the video but
this is the Coastal Scents palette that
you can kind of like rearrange all the
colors because it is magnet at the back
so you can just have all your eye shows
in there and then just pop them in
wherever you want I do want to put some
and Mac eyeshadows in here as well
because I think that would just be
perfect for like all of your eyeshadows
if you don't want to have them in the
hot thing sorry my hair has been
extremely dry because it is winter here
in Australia so I had to get some hair
treatment products so I picked up the
Moroccan oil restorative hair masque and
the Moroccan oil treatment and these
have been working wonders on my hair
I've absolutely been obsessed with these
I picked up a few things from it John
Frieda and the first one is the shampoo
conditioner this is the luxurious volume
I have
extremely flat hair so I thought I would
try these out and see if it actually
makes my hair fuller so we'll see how
these go I also got the full repair
hydrate and rescue deep conditioner
again my hair has been so dry so I just
want to keep trying different practice
see what actually works okay so let's
take a moment to appreciate this product
this is the John Frieda touch-up
flyweight tamer so it's basically like a
little mascara one and you run it
through your hair to make it really
slick and this is honestly so good can
we just take a moment of silence this is
amazing I can't deal so because I do
have extremely flat hair I got the root
booster blurred right lotion and the
blowout spray I just want to get my hair
to be volume eyes is that too much to
ask for so hopefully these do their job
so the last haircare product that I got
is the frizz is intensive Alaska Moskva
I have no idea how to pronounce that
once again so I have used it quite a bit
of this because I couldn't wait to
include it in my haul obviously I have
no patience when it comes to beauty well
haircare I don't know my hair's dry so I
had to use it and I did notice a
difference with this it did make my hair
feel a lot more moisturized and less dry
so this has been extremely helpful I
also picked up a little black clutch
this is from Colette and I did get this
to take to parties because all I like to
take is my wallet and no all I'd like to
take is my phone in like $5 or $10 or my
key card or whatever so this just fits
that ear nice and snug because it's not
too big and I also got the new me time 3
curling on set this comes with three
different size barrels and then the head
and it can actually change the
temperature which is pretty cool I was
thinking of doing a hair dryer using
this if you guys are interested just
leave a comment below I was thinking of
doing like an area under Grande inspired
hair tutorial you know how she has the
big curls and then sub hair up some hair
down I thought that would be snazzy
I wanted a hair dryer for the longest
time now because I have to share one
with my mum so I finally got my hands on
my own one this is the new me signature
tourmaline hair dryer hair blow up
whatever you call it and I just love the
color but it is a gorgeous metallic
shade and it comes with three nozzles
I'm actually so excited to use this it's
crazy sorry if the camera change angles
a little bit my camera died and I just
they're looking at a charge for about 10
minutes anyways I have one more thing to
show you guys and it is the Winston
Smith Malibu bone heels and these are
honestly the best high heels I have ever
got in my entire life
like just take a look at them they are
the perfect height they're not too short
they're not too high and they have the
ankle strap and the color is just to die
for
I got things from rapture boutique and
honestly

life so that we have it I have finally
finished the hall thank you so much if
