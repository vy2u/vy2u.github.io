channel so it's been four days since I
posted which is like not okay I've been
into Nev the last two days or something
and I was doing something very special
that I'll be able to share with you guys
very soon and yeah I've just been a
little bit busy so that's why I haven't
been able to post a video yesterday or
the day before but today I'm here with a
very nice long haul so my manager mi got
me a bunch of makeup from Sephora when
she went to LA so I sent her a big list
and she sent me booth and I was just
like yes I've been so excited because
all these products are so hard to get in
Australia so I'm really glad that she
could get them for me
I love you Emma oh my god and there's
also a few other things in here from
like morphe and other hairdressers that
I wanna share with you because the very
second okay let's get into it
okely-dokely let's start with some
foundation so the first one is the
giorgio armani luminous silk foundation
the packaging starters is stunning it's
like a acrylic glass kind of bottle and
I just think it's so sleek I'm hoping
the foundation is good because I've
heard a lot of people talk about this
and the color seems to be pretty spot-on
I would say it is a few shades darker
I'm at Fisher's layer than when I've got
my face right now which will be good
because this one's really really dark
this is in the shade at 6.5 and if you
guys want me to do a first impressions
then let me know because I've been more
than happy to do that the next one is
the Kat Von D locket tattoo foundation
this is a 24 hour we're not going to lie
I wouldn't wear a 24 hours but this is
actually what I have in my face today
you'll see that in my next first
impressions video what I think of it
okay let me just say it is extremely
extremely full coverage so if you have
like a problem skin it would probably be
perfect for you because it is like
literally look it just will cover oh my
god is my microphone on good boy it's on
so yeah as I was saying this is just
going to cover literally everything I
would not recommend this for clear skin
this is for people with skin problems
like me this is what I'm the most
excited to talk about and that is the
toilet eyes shadow palette
first of all the packaging is gorgeous
and second of all look at all of those
colors every single color in here I'm
going to use you know really an
eyeshadow palette and you're like I'm
going to get that eye shadow palette
because of those like four colors and
I'm just not going to use the rest this
one I literally can use every single
color because every single color is
gorgeous okay I'm just going to stop
talking about this now because I have a
feeling you're going to hear me talk
about it Oh next we have these a Weaver
cocoa blend eyeshadow palette the colors
in here are stunning my few favorite are
these two right here because they're
extremely warm they are very very
pigmented as you can see I'm really
excited to use these in a makeup
tutorial actually because this isn't
pretty sure as a wave it doesn't really
have too much makeup on their website
well so it doesn't really create too
much makeup so it's exciting for them to
come out with makeup cause I'm like
obsessed with their brushes so very
proud of the leave out freaking loves
the Weaver the next is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills artist palette it is
gorgeous packaging so I got this because
I always do neutral Ashley looks and I
thought if I get it I shouldn't hello
that has color in it then maybe I will
add color in my met help so if you guys
want to see any kind of eye shields with
this let me know the colors are very
intense they're not over-the-top pigment
pigmented but they do a pretty good job
I'm so guilty right now I'm talking
about makeup geek again but quickly I
just want to talk about these down the
side here so these are all foiled
eyeshadows they came out with new colors
I'm obsessed with them so we've got like
a nice like a mermaid purple and then we
have like a fairy pink right here this
color I feel like I'll use all the time
come on it's in a focus hello
alert oh there we go so all of these are
new and I've got a few more in my
cupboard as well that I'm going to be
using so next thing I have is the morphe
brush Wagner ooh it says normal Russians
but it's not a brush but this is a blush
kit so all the colors in here are
stunning except this one I couldn't
imagine myself wearing that but I'm
going to try it out it looks a bit
overwhelming but I do have a few
when you know you put hiccups when you
put a little bit on I'm sure it will
look fun but the ones that I'm obsessed
with is these two right here because
they're just nice and dusty and like a
dark rosy color which is like my
favorite but I just sorted be good to
have like lots in one palette so when I
travel and stuff I can take it with me
super small and I think it's gonna come
in handy so oh and by the way so
pigmented I have them I actually will
color I have my cheek today I have it
this one okay no I have this one right
here on my cheeks today and obsessed but
like seriously I was a little like a
clown when I first put them on because I
didn't really have pigmented than me the
next little on tap palette I have right
here is a runs out or contour palette
something in my eyeball
um I don't have any contour pellets
that's why I picked it up but every time
I try one out it never works me I don't
know why maybe I tried the wrong color
when I was contouring my face I'm pretty
sure I use this one or this one I'm not
too sure but whatever color I use any of
the first time the other day it looked
like mud on my face and I was in a rush
and I had to actually like washing a
whole makeup off because it just looked
really muddy
maybe I just have to keep trying around
different colors in here I'm not sure if
any are going to work with my skin tone
but yeah I don't know all Khaleed ugly
time for some bronzes the first one here
I have is the Bobbi Brown medium to
running powder
um I haven't used this so I don't even
know what to say about it what it looks
like this and it's not overly pigmented
but that's kind of what I like in
bronzes because I don't want them to be
like boom I want them to be able to
build up to the intensity that I want so
I guess you'll see this in a new video
because I have not used it you guys
probably know what this is because I'm
smelling it it is the true face dark
chocolate Soleil do ten and matte
bronzer so this is a shade darker than
all of the stuff that they have now so
they finally came out with it um first
of all it smells like literal chocolate
which is like telling me already I have
this on my cheekbones today and it's
really pigmented like really really
really pigmented so I went a bit
overboard and when you do that and it's
a bit dirty and muddy but I do like
really strong contour and for it to go
money kind of sucks but I guess I'll
keep working with it and see how it goes
maybe you can't apply this much maybe
it's meant for like subtle I don't know
I'm gonna keep using it see how it goes
next we have the makeup forever
Pruitt's sculpting duo oh my god that
was my stomach grumbling hey oh my god I
always do that my videos it sounds like
Peter Griffin Hey
Wow hippo Sean you're gonna have no
friends so this is what it looks like
right here it has like a bronzer or a
contour I'm not even sure what it is
because I don't really know anything
about this brand and then we have the
highlighter right here which is a
gorgeous like golden eye color I don't
really have any like that so I'm excited
to use it actually I have a somewhat
cheap brand today it wasn't like overly
pigmented when I put it on that's what
because I'm used to like they're
mary-lou manizer and yes I lick my
finger so I can wipe it on my clothes
down there um but it still does look
really pretty as you can see next we
have the Bobbi Brown shimmer brick in
the shade bronze it looks like this
everyone and the dogs have this I was
like why Mazal jump on the bandwagon if
I'm going to get things like $10 shoe
plus so I got it the thing that I like
about this is that it has obviously lots
of different shades so you can really
choose what kind of highlight you want
so you can have a really really bright
lecture and painting highlight you could
have a golden highlight or a dark like
bronzy kind of highlight so I think
that's really cool but can we step back
for just one moment because I do have a
lot to say about this one it is the
Becca highlight in your shade opal I use
it yesterday and I fell in love at first
sight it is a gorgeous like champagne
highlighter and it literally is so
pigmented and buttery and creamy when
you put on your face it's just like silk
it's like I just I cannot wait to use
this like every day of my life because I
feel like that's what's gonna happen oh
my god I forgot to talk about this
foundation at the start where I was
talking about the others but this is the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation in
ashamed cashew this is a perfect shade
for me when I have a really really dark
tan I would say it's like a little
little too orange but it works really
well when I like blend it together put
some bronzer on and it just
oh this stuff is amazing for clubbing I
would recommend this for the daytime
just because it is super super thick and
not really daytime appropriate um I do
wear it in a day time if I'm going to a
photo shoot or someone here I hate when
that happens I think someone's here but
they're not um yep one recommender for
the day time when I'm going to photo
shoots and stuff that's when I wear it
just because I hold on to my frickin
face so well and it's really good with
photos it doesn't have flash back so
this is my second model I also have
former scars right here the first two I
already own but I would I bought backup
because everyone should have their cops
of these they're amazing
this one is the benefit they're real
mascara this stuff makes my lashes look
great it really really separates them it
doesn't add too much volume but I always
put this mascara over the top to do that
so these two together work so well um to
benefit they're real and then I also
have the Urban Decay perversion
they got black are bad in the sky this
stuff is what makes your eyelashes
volume Ines like woah super super thick
and black and just this oh my god I
can't even you guys are probably seen
users before the wand is soon fat and
I'm just just really in love with this
mascara okay okay bye the next one I
have is the Tarte lights camera lashes
out
goodbye mascara this mascara are using
my first impressions and my next video
and bless my soul when I try it on I was
like oh my god I can't
and you weren't your oh that's a good or
bad thing until you watch this feel so
this one is the benefit roller lash to
be honest I bought this because I
thought that it had a little roller
thing on there that like rolled what do
you might like this and I thought would
just like roll around so yes I'm gonna
get that that's so cool but it doesn't
but I'm still actually really happy with
it I use it today and it did a really
good job I'm not sure if I like the
benefit one the better they're real one
but oh I'm getting a bit sick I'll also
have the Anastasia brow jeera powder in
the shade soft brown can I just talk
about the packaging like that little
logo that rose gold rose gold rose gold
logo is so stunning I just think the
packaging is so sleek so these are the
colors right here we have a light brown
and a dark brown I use the dark one for
my eyebrows that's what I have on today
it's just start start easy to apply my
eyebrows with if I want a really grown
look and that's just what I grape
immerse the time the next one is the
brow Wiz in a shade soft brown I'm so
excited that I have this in my hands
right now because I wanted Anastasio
products like my whole life
I freaking black see every single you
should be that I watch use this and I'm
just like I need it everyone raised
about it um guys I don't really know how
to say this but it didn't work for me so
I like freakin love this stuff because I
can really make my eyebrows thick and
draw like under my actual eyebrow like
on the skin but with this you obviously
can't do that because it's a pencil and
it's like a waxy formula if you want
like an everyday brow like you just
simply want to go over your brows make
them darker and fill in any sparse areas
or even like yeah that's pretty much it
if you want that then this would be
perfect I don't think I've showed you
guys these but I got sent them ages ago
and can I just tell you I'm obsessed
with color pot products I love their
lippie stix and pencils and their
eyeshadows these are what the eyeshadows
look like right here these are so
pigmented and the packaging is gorgeous
so let me just swatch this one this
one's in the shade la la is a really
nice like Goldy coppery kind of color
and literally I've never felt nationally
that feels like if I've never in my life
felt such silk in my life like I'm not
even kidding
look how pigmented that is like do I
even need to say anything now and the
other one they sent me is 280 I'm not
quite sure how that supposed to be
pronounced but this is a curl that I'm
obsessed with because it's like a warm
orange color and like that's what I live
for pretty much so it would be a perfect
transition shade and like these two
together were like best friends next
thing that I have here is the Make Up
For Ever step one and mattifying primer
unfortunately I have dry skin so I won't
be able to use this I'm pretty sure they
just chuck this in as like a free sample
something because I have so much I
originally wanted this smoothie or the
hydro anyone for my skin because I think
that would come in handy for me I'll
probably just go get it
Australia because they do have it here
I'm pretty sure and if not that's up
walls yeah if you guys want to
mattifying primer having used it you can
comment down below I have an oily face
or on and I'll send it to one you guys
that'll sit random I also have the duo
adhesive glue ugly unfazed I've used
these for years now and I just sort of
get some more because I cannot live
without my new old adhesive I have been
using the cheap stuff for a while just
because I've been out and to be honest
like it
why does my camera always cut out
everything to be honest these yeah the
cheap ass crew isn't that bad because
like it stays on because I put kind of a
lot of glue on and then when I want to
take them off it comes off really easy
but when I want to take my eyelashes off
with this it's like no no no your
eyelashes on going anyway and it kind of
hurts take them off but as long as you
like to it the right way like with
makeup remover and stuff it's fine and
they which it was stay on all night and
I also have another eyelash glue this is
the velour lash I wanted this because
you apply it with this little tip right
here oh my god I keep stirring and I'm
just really really sorry about that I'm
sorry I just thought the applicator was
really easy to use and I just sort of
get it I used it yesterday it wasn't
that good but maybe I used the wrong
lashes with it or something I don't
really know I also have two I creams the
first one is first day beauty it is the
I do D triple remedy so this one has
like a little silver thing on it right
here and it's really cold
and you just put it under your eyes and
the cream comes out up here it's kind of
like a peachy kind of color so it
cancels out the discoloration a little
bit and it still is like freezing on
your under eye area and it feels like
really really good when you put it on so
I really like that I also have the
origins zing zing refreshing eye cream
I'm not sure how to pronounce that one
but how does that surprise you because I
watch everything this light comes with a
lot of product in here a little goes a
really really really really long way I
like the formula of it so far it's doing
well as I said I'll keep you updated
because you can't tell overnight with
this stuff I'm not sure if I've talked
about these in a video before I'm pretty
sure I haven't because I didn't get in
that long ago but these are the Mac lip
pencils I love Mac lip pencils they're
so easy to overdraw your lips with
they're just really creamy and the
quality is just just all there
so the first one is rooby-roo which is
just like a bright red I'm sure you guys
have heard of the lipstick rooby-roo so
I just actually didn't have a red one so
I thought I'd get one the next one is um
edge to edge which is just a dark pink
color I didn't have a pink either so
that's just something that will go with
nearly every pink lipstick that I own
and then I have boldly bear which is a
neutral kind of branding nude color
these lines are perfect to over dry lips
really really big without them looking
true fake actually the cons you look
fake but whatever I just like these a
lot
I also got some new brushes by morphe I
got two more of the blending brushes
these are the M b23 this is just perfect
to put in my crease and blend out my
transition shades
oh my god so I got more and I also have
these two right here this is the m-40
three this is really really good for
contouring for blush you can use this
even as powder and I also have this one
oh this is named in morphe this is
furless I don't know I found this in my
room I don't know where it came from but
this is amazing for contouring like okay
this video is taking it forever the next
thing I have is the Beauty Blender I've
been using this for so many years but I
thought about to have a got a new one
because of my other ones really dirty
and afters really happy with my life I
could cry oh I love speed Linda's so
much now time for some false lashes I
freaking love false lashes I have true
from actually I have mold intruder on my
cupboard I just want to show you these
ones these are from chantix sorry she
has the most amazing freaking eyelashes
myrrh season come out okay that was
really weird my voice just went again
marsupial lashes come out as like a cat
eye shape and that's what I live for I
freaking love cat eye shaped eyelashes
the band is super thin I need a practice
speaking the fantasy within it's not
super easy to apply them I bought them
yesterday and I'm just completely
obsessed with then I also have more
eyelashes here these ones are the Cara
ones and these ones are the red cherry
lashes red cherry ones have been what
I've been living for the last like three
years
I get these off eBay actually got like
20 pounds $400 which is more than what I
usually pay which kind of sucks as they
up there press but the 48 or 45 lashes
are my dead set favorite that's what I
have on today really pretty I'm pretty
sure that the Carol lashes are actually
the exact same as the red cherry ones
are just a different label and I both
like two dollars so whatever Tampa
summit hair products and then we are
done so so I have the system
professional color side conditioner and
shampoo I actually got this from a
someone because I went to get my hair
done
at horse horse meat disco I'm so asked
about that because that is the strangest
I'm over the hood it's a salon in
Brisbane and they are incredible I just
got some blonde down here and a little
bit you guys would have really heard of
that on my snapchat or Instagram I'm
sure but they did an amazing amazing job
and I use this last night and my hair
has never been so soft in my life this
is for continuously protecting hair
color I really didn't want my hair to
die because of all the bleach and stuff
in my pan and I was getting really
scared
so this to the rescue I also have the
Moroccan oil treatment I've been using
this for so many years all I do is put a
few pumps on my fingertips and rub it in
from my ears down and it keeps my hand
let's dive and last but not least stuff
is amazing it is the Moroccan oil
restorative yes hair mask it is just
like this really thick consistency kind
of like okay you can't see it I'm gonna
stop being lazy no I'm not gonna stop
being lazy because that's wet Oh bless
my life I don't realize had good that
smells so it's just like this really
thick and meaty stuff they put through
your hair leave it in for like half an
hour or so and then you wash it out and
your hair will literally feel so
incredibly soft and healthy and rich and
just so much life in your hair follicles
so there we have my whole video I hope
