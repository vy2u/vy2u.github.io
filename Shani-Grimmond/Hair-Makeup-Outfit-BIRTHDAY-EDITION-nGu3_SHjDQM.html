gross
hey guys I hope you're doing well so
let's go ahead and jump straight into
the birthday makeup so the first thing
that I did was took my soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac just to prime my eyes and to
make sure my eyeshadow stays on longer
and to get rid of those veins on my
eyelids so gross and then I'm going to
set that with my Rimmel stay matte
powder just to make sure that my
eyeshadows blend out really nicely on
top now with my Too Faced natural matte
palette I'm picking up the shade honey
butter this is just going to be my
transition shade so with a really big
fluffy brush I'm just going to blend
this from inner corner to outer corner
these colors are beautiful and so easy
to blend so now taking the shade
chocolate cookie I'm going to add this
in the crease just to add some more
definition so just on a smaller brush so
it doesn't get blown out too much
otherwise it's going to look like I have
been punched in the eyeball now with the
makeup geek many MUA palette I'm going
to take the shader Aphrodite and add
this in the crease once again so pretty
much the same concept as the last shade
I'm just really building up the shades
to make it darker and to make the
transition soft and seamless or again
just blending it out as you do my
favorite part is cleaning out those
edges so here we go and then taking the
shade insomnia by that same palette this
is stunning it is so incredibly
pigmented I always put a bit of fix+ on
when I'm doing my lid shade just to make
it even more intense so this is a
beautiful green with nice reflexive
purple so definitely a really really
easy way to wear color
now with the Inglot pigment in the shade
85 I'm just going to put this in the
middle of my lid it's it's literally
like exact same color it's just a little
bit more sparkly so just add some more
dimension pop on that on with a little
pencil brush and now with my simple kind
of skin moisturizer I'm just going to
put this all over my face I have the dry
skin at the moment I think it's because
I've been traveling a lot and when
you're in
means it literally just dries out so
back then I'm going to take my Nivea man
aftershave balm this is the best primer
I've ever used so I'm just going to put
this all over my face and rub it in
until it gets super tacky so the
foundation can stick to it like glue and
then I'm going to take my Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I have the
shade six and it matches so well to my
really dark fake tans and I love the
finish of this foundation it's super
full coverage but it still is a little
bit luminous so it doesn't look too
cakey but if you apply as much as me
then yeah you're probably gonna look at
me okay but that's just how I like it if
you guys are looking for a cheaper
alternative but for a foundation that
has a really similar coverage and finish
and stuff the Too Faced Born This Way in
the shade warm beige is pretty much
identical to this except the Giorgio
Armani one is like $95 so I just use
this because I want to change it up a
bit and they're both just as beautiful
as each other now taking my bare skin
bare minerals concealer in the shade
light is a super bright bright shade to
highlight my face which I love so much
so I'm just going to put this under my
eyes and also down the center of my face
to add a bit more dimension because I
feel when you add like foundation it
kind of washes that all the color in
your face and it's kind of flatter this
really does add some dimension beautiful
beautiful concealer now taking my little
baby my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm going to apply this
with a wedge you can get like a pack of
wedges for one
say six dollars for like 20 it is so
incredibly cheap and it's easier than
using a Beauty Blender I think because
then you don't have to wash it in
between uses I mean you should but I
don't do it too often go to Steinem and
then of course taking my essence
eyebrows stylist said I always come back
to this even though it's like the
cheapest thing literally I own makeup
wise it works pretty much the best so
I'm just making my arch a little bit
higher and extending my brows making
them a bit darker but because I got them
tatted on it takes me like two seconds I
love it and then taking my benefit gimme
brow to set my little brow hairs down in
place and to add a little bit of texture
to them as well
now with the shade Optimus I'm going to
highlight my brow bone so just putting
it directly under my eyebrow you know
how it is next step is to brush away all
of that package and then I'm going to go
ahead and crewing contour a bit so this
is the LA girl Pro conceal in the shade
borne so I'm just doing my forehead and
a little bit on my cheekbones I don't
know why do this before I finish my eyes
I went in the weirdest order but anyway
it's just for a little bit of a bronzy
glow blending that out with my Beauty
Blender this seriously comes in handy
all the bloody time
to make that even more intense
I'm taking my boy Brown at bronzing
powder in the shade - this is amazing
it's very similar to the hoola by
benefit so I'm just going to put that in
the same places and also I'm going to
contour my nose a little bit I don't
really know how to do it I just round up
and down the sides so I guess we're back
onto the eyes so I'm taking a honey
butter from outer corner to inner corner
just to add a nice wash of color and
then on top of that I'm going to take
chocolate cookie to deepen it up even
more and lastly I'm going to take a like
really thin definer brush and I'm just
going to run aphrodite
right along that lower lash line to add
a bit more depth and deepness and
darkness you know you know since it was
my birthday I wanted to go all out so
I'm taking some black eyeliner from
zoeva I'm pretty sure these are new and
it was the first time using this for me
and holy crap this is the most pigmented
black eyeliner I've ever used and it
didn't come off even in the bloody
shower winning and now taking my
covergirl mascara cold I will finish
what you started this is actually a
really really good mascara it separates
your lashes so much so it's really good
to put on before your fill see so just
hurting my top and bottom lashes and
again taking that white shimmery shade
called Artemis from the makeup geek
palette I'm gonna highlight my inner
corners just to add more drama
I mean liability not and then for lashes
I'm taking the hooter beauty so mix
there are 12 lashes girl these are
amazing these a leg double layered so
they're just super dramatic and wispy
and incredible color now taking my ephra
bronzer in the shade a bronzing gold I'm
just gonna put this all over my
cheekbones just to add a nice wash of
color and also around my forehead as
well so after I've done that I went in
with the Mac gold deposit because I
wanted more of like a glittery bronzy
look and this really is so pigmented and
so beautiful definitely a Holy Grail of
mine so just going over the top and both
of these together look
no cred you know what I love when my
contour line is super clean and harsh so
obviously I'm gonna go in and clean it
up with a wedge and my look my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder and
while that's baking I'm going in with my
cindy lou manizer blush this is stunning
it's from the balm
it's a really nice light wash of
shimmery pink now with my anastasi our
peach nectar highlighter I mean I'm
gonna put a lot of this on my face so
just on top of my cheekbones and pretty
much all over my face I put fix+
on my brush to make it even more intense
because I love to shine bright like a
diamond do you know what I mean for lips
today I'm starting off with the essence
lip liner in the shade 11 in the nude to
be honest this isn't really the best lip
liner it is extremely certainly but also
definitely worth the price it's probably
like three dollars or something but I
definitely do prefer like my NYX lip
planners and stuff like that so after
that I'm gonna go ahead and add my
Charlotte Tilbury Penelope pink lipstick
and again I would prefer to use a
different lipstick but I always use my
MAC lipsticks I always use the same
bloody stuff so I thought I'd change it
up and then going in with a lighter nude
this one is from BH Cosmetics I just
wanted to kind of add more dimension to
my lips and create an ombre lip so
that's what I'm doing here and of course
to make my lips nice and glossy and
juicy looking I'm taking my YSL lip
gloss in 0-2 just popping this all over
my lips it is a beautiful gloss and
lastly I'm setting my face with my Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
this kind of soaks up the powder well I
feel like it does anyway so let's move
on to the hair most of the time when I
go clubbing I just like to straight my
hair and have it down because I feel
like if I have it any other way it's
just gonna look like a big ball of fluff
by the end of the night especially if
I'm gonna have a big one so first things
first just brushing all of those knots
out and then I'm going to add some dry
shampoo to add some texture and also to
soak up all of that oil I don't know why
but I literally have the
I really have all the oiliest cap
brushing that all through and then
parting my hair and straightening it I'm
sure you guys know how to straighten
your hair but I use the GHG I think it's
like a pearl straightener I love this so
much I mean love a lot of people ask how
I keep my hair so healthy and so long
and I mean for the length there's
nothing really magical that you can do
to make your hair grow really long it
just all comes down to the time I've
been growing my hair out for so many
years now and keeping it healthy I would
just recommend not putting too much heat
on it if I am gonna put heat on it it's
only once a week max and I feel like
this honestly doesn't make such
different cuz you don't want to kill
your little baby hairs well they're not
baby if it is long oh good so the way I
like to style it usually is put it on
the side tuck one side behind my ear by
the end of the night it's probably all
back my favorite perfume at the moment
is the flower bomb perfume it smells so
beautiful and so fresh so for the nails
I'm taking my hoodie Beauty nails and oh
my god this is so embarrassing
my nails are literally yellow because I
left nail polish on them for so long
that's why I put fake nails on top so I
didn't have to paint them again and
another embarrassing thing that I did
was I frickin put them on the wrong way
around so once I'd like one hand was all
upside down and then the other hand as
you can see right here is the right way
so I just ripped them off the next day
it says and lastly for my outfit I
decided to wear this true piece from a
lady Luck's Boutique it is so
comfortable I had to wear like a black
crop underneath the crop just because if
I didn't you could see my nipples and
you know what that happening to do
otherwise you miss well like a black
strapless bra but I didn't have one at
the time the clutch that I'm wearing is
a Louis Vuitton it just comes with my
bag and it just goes with every outfit
so that's what I've been using lately
and yeah that's pretty much all I hope
you guys love this outfit and love the
makeup and hair I think it's so cute and
so classy I had a really good birthday
and I really want to say thank you so
much to everyone that said happy
birthday and for all the wishes I love
you guys so so much and I will see you
in my next video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
