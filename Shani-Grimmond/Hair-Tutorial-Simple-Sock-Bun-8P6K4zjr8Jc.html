sock bun so it only takes a few minutes
so just keep on watching if you want to
know how I'm see on the side so you can
like basically see everything I'm doing
a bit easier for you see so yeah this is
what it looks like okay so basically
just the first step is to put your hair
in a ponytail you can have it wherever
you want it can be down here it can be
until the head if you want it like mine
buy something and then grab the little
spongy donut looking thing and you can
get it from like so many places like
worse drugstore chemists warehouses
wherever you really go they'll be one of
these they're like really cheap so
basically put your fingers through the
middle and then return it to hair time
just like wrap it around your hair tie
and then pull it through and then just
going to like puff it up so there's like
no spaces and then grab the first bit of
hair and kind of just wind it around
just keep pulling your hair round the
donut until it looks kind of you know
um you've got long hair it's really
going to be like huge okay so once you
spun your hair all the way around the
donut you're just going to have to get
some good with bobby pins usually a lot
because black tends to get a bit messy
sometimes and you're just going to pin
all the bits that haven't necessarily
gone into the bun with the rest of the
hair
it stays put you can just sleep around
you get it equipment and if it's true hi
can pull out some hair salt falls down
or if it's true low you can pull out the
bits at the top and all tighten a bit
yeah but that's basically all you do and
just you can hairspray your hair if you
like if you wear it all day if you want
to stay up all day
yeah it only takes a few minutes and I I
read a lot actually like to work into
school out even yeah thanks for watching
guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
