Hey
Oh
hey guys it's shiny and welcome back to
my channel so before I even get into
this video I really want you guys to
pause it right now and comment down
below which side you think is high-end
is this side high-end or is this side
high-end and then you can unpause the
video and come back so in today's video
I'm doing half my face with high-end
half my face with drugstore and I'm
super excited because I think it turned
out really well I think both sides look
very very similar and I have some
amazing amazing drugstore products to
share with you a lot of jupe Sandpoint
this is going to be amazing
so let's go ahead and jump straight into
the video on my high-end side I'm going
to take my Mac fluidline brow gel cream
in the shade at true brunette I
absolutely love this product so much
this is my favorite brow product and
then on the drugstore side I'm going to
take the chi chi chi chi Chi Chi really
the g-tube brow pomade in the shade and
medium brown I haven't used this one yet
but the color looks pretty good it's a
little bit dark but let's work with it
shall we
so starting with the Mac product I'm
just going to fill my brows in as I
normally do oh my god I literally am
obsessed with this product it just
glides on so nicely it's really creamy
so I just want the brush-off so there's
no additional product and I'm going to
dip this in to see what formula oh my
god that is very meaty oh my god is a
sorry pigmented alright so I'm actually
really really impressed with this chichi
product like I have nothing bad to say
at all it's so easy to apply so creamy
and I'm just like obsessed with it and
then to conceal my brows on the high end
side I'm taking the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in the shade NC 20 so I'm just
going to put really small amount there
and just carve the match on the other
side I'm going to take the next HD
concealer this one is a really thick
moosie consistency so I do much prefer
the Mac concealer but let's move on I'm
going to go in and prime my eyelids with
that same Mac concealer on this side
they're still such a good job at
covering veins and discoloration and all
that and then using a different brush
I'm just going to prime the other side
so the next concealer definitely does
dry out a look we call you have to work
really fast with it um but it still does
cover really really well now it's time
for the eye shadow I'm taking the it
cosmetics and naturally pretty palette
and I'm going to pick up the shade
sunset right here and this is going to
go directly in the crease so I want to
do kind of like a warm autumn fall kind
of look today oh my god that is so
pigmented I haven't used this palette in
the longest time I literally just picked
up this smallest amount my god it's
beautiful
so wiping off this brush then I'm going
to take the chichi spices palette which
I only picked up the other day and I'm
so excited about it because when i
swatched it the colors were just like
incredible let me swatch a few so you
can see what I mean like this is a
drugstore palette and look how penguin
said that is now taking the shade in the
crease just like this side so this one
is the high-end product this one is a
chichi so as you can see they're both
just as pigmented
each other there is just a slight color
change I would say this one's just a bit
more warm and a bit darker all right
let's do this I would say it's taking a
few minutes more just to blend out the
edges and the other one now going in
with the violet Voss Holy Grail eyes
shadow palette I'm going to take the
shade brownie points right here and this
one is going to go directly in the
crease to warm it up a little bit so I'm
just taking a smaller blending brush and
popping it right in here and then on the
other side I'm going to take this shade
right here but it's blending just as
well as the violet voice one now going
in with a shade cranberry splash from
the violet Voss palette I'm going to put
this on the inner corner and the outer
corner I'm gonna do a bit of a halo eye
today even though it's like a comparison
video I still want the makeup looked
pretty I'm just going to Pat this down
so it's as pigmented as it can be and of
course wiping that brush off then I'm
going in with this color right here
which isn't as like foiled but it still
is a very shimmery shade and then I'm
going to take the shade at toffee which
is a beautiful bright shimmery gold I'm
just going to put this directly in the
middle so I'm just going to fade the two
colors over the top of each other and
then on the other side I'm going to take
this color right here
now moving on to the face on the
high-end side I'm taking the makeup
forever hydrating primer I honestly
haven't uses before and if I have I
can't remember if it was good or not so
let's put it to the test today oh my god
it's so moisturizing so anyways let's
move on to the other side this is the
NYX angel veil primer I use this all the
time it is a really thick like
consistency as you can see right there
it's not as easy to blend in because it
is kind of like it's kind of dry when
you rub it in um but it makes my face
feels so smooth then for foundation I'm
going to take the Marc jects remarkable
foundation I have this shade 54 I'm just
going to dot this on my face I'm going
to match it to my fake tan neck I'm just
going to buff this into my skin my god
it's like covers absolutely everything
I'm also going to blend it down my neck
as well because my tan has faded a tiny
bit I feel like you do have to work
really fast with this foundation because
it is kind of like dry I bet you've
never seen anything like this before
look at the difference so I'm going to
take a different brush for the other
side and I'm taking the Maybelline fit
me matte and poreless foundation I
absolutely love this foundation I'm in
the shade 310 Sun beige this one feels
quite moisturizing when you put it on
the face because it's more like a wet
consistency um but it isn't as full
coverage as the Marc Jacobs one but it
still has a really really nice like
medium coverage I'd probably prefer this
coverage over this one because I feel
like this one's just like a mask but it
definitely is good for like special
occasions and stuff now it's time for
concealer to lighten up my complexion a
bit so I'm taking the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer in the shade at like
neutral this is my Holy Grail concealer
it is absolutely amazing so I'm just
going to paint this on my face why not
and then just dab this in I'm also going
to clean up
this eyeshadow line as well I'm also
just highlighting my chin and up here a
bit just for a bit more dimension on the
other side I'm taking the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade at 15 I
absolutely love this concealer on my
what I think this is a light shade this
concealer is probably my favorite
drugstore concealer I'm just taking a
bit of Mac prep and prime on the other
side because I didn't realize how bright
that Maybelline concealer was so just
blending this in with the other side of
the beauty blender now let's set that
concealer down in place so I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder on this side just
blending out any creases before I do
that and start baking
only they can all ever do and on the
other side I'm taking the Rimmel match
perfection at silky loose face powder
I've never actually uses to bake so this
is going to be very interesting just
flipping the Beauty Blender around again
now to set my face I'm taking the Mac
select share press powder in the shade
NC 40 I'm just going to Pat this right
on I actually don't have a drugstore
powder
that's like that has any color to it but
I do know that the Australis fresh and
flawless powder is like amazing probably
even better than this then with a
different brush I'm going to take the
Rimmel stay matte transparent powder I
really hope this doesn't leave a white
cost on my face just going to dab this
in now for the lower lash line again I'm
going to take the shade sunset and put
this from inner corner to outer corner
and then taking this shade on the other
side oh my god my eyes going to leak
please stop please
and then taking those gold shades again
and I'm just going to put them right in
the middle of my lower lash line you can
definitely tell the violet ball shade
there's a lot more shimmery than this
gold now going in with the benefit a
roller lash on the left side I'm just
gonna Curt my top and bottom lashes and
then on the other side I'm sure you guys
knew this was coming I'm taking my
L'Oreal telescopic mascara this is my
all-time favorite I think it's better
than any high-end mascara I've ever used
please don't mind my fake ten fingers
it's like a well and truly time to scrub
but turn off I'm gonna do it all for
this video I just put some false lashes
on off-camera just because I don't have
any affordable lashes at the moment but
I will list a few different brands down
below that are really similar to this
style but affordable so now let's move
on to the face I'm going to take the
benefit hoola bronzer and I'm just going
to use this to contour under my
cheekbones so I'm just going to use an
angled brush and also my jaw bone as
well just go ahead dust off as much as I
can rub it on my tail and then I'm going
to take the sleek face contour kit in
light I'm going to so nervous I've never
used this before no ice oh that's pretty
good the shades actually really nice as
you can see this is more of like a red
tone than this one this is just really
neutral like Brown now for bronzer I'm
going to take the matte gold deposit and
the Milani baked bronzer in the shade
golden this one here is obviously a lot
more orange tone than this color but
let's see if we can make it work we're
just putting this basically on top of my
contour this is absolutely stunning I
love this I'm also just going to put
this around my forehead this has like a
lot of shimmers throughout it sorry it
just makes your skin look so luminous
just brushing off all of that product
and then going in with the Milani one I
really like this for a cheap op Runza um
but this one again is like more ready
tone than the golden gold deposit I'm
just gonna bake with the Rimmel on this
side and Laura Mercier on this side
because well that was just like really
intense and it went everywhere now for
blush I'm taking the it nas in the
shader Moore and the essence blush in
the shade berry me up as you can see the
shades are very similar and this one is
just as buttery as Naz it is so
pigmented I love the essence blushes
just taking a very small amount of the
nos because these are so pigmented just
going to put this on the apples and then
blend it back let's do this let's brush
away this bake and see what we're left
with oh my god this one's so hard to
blend off why Napa highlight I'm going
in with the Becca highlight in the shade
opal and then the nude by Nature little
palette that I picked up so I'm going to
use the shade on the end right here so
much this one so let's go in I love
doing my highlighter so much I'm also
going to put this on the tip of my nose
I can't really do half of my nose so I'm
just gonna use this one now going in
with the one by nude by Nature I just
brushed off any excess product I'll
never use this I'm excited now for the
lips I'm taking the Kylie Jenner
cosmetics the lip line in the shade -
okay and then the NYX lip pencil in the
shade natural so just going in with
Kylie
I'm not sure if this is exactly like
high-end but let's just go with it now
going in with the next one I would just
say that the Kylie cosmetics one is a
bit more creamy and the next one is
probably a shade warmer I think I like
this color better now for the lipstick
I'm taking the Mac in the shade yes and
then the Clinique in the shade I listed
down below I absolutely love MAC
lipsticks and my favorite so because the
two shades are a bit different I'm going
to go in with a gloss on both sides so
on the high-end side I'm taking the dose
of colors in undressed and the color pop
in the shade fairy floss I absolutely
love the color pop glosses and then to
set all of this makeup down in place I'm
going in with the Urban Decay all
nighter in long-lasting and the
Maybelline where a boosting setting
spray I absolutely swear by the urban
decay setting spray is like whoa you
know just not like a fart gross so here
we have the finished makeup look this
just goes to prove that you don't
actually need a really expensive makeup
to have a nice makeup look sometimes
high-end products are just easier to
work with but in today's video I think
both of the products on each side worked
really really well I'm super impressed
with all the drugstore products I think
they look absolutely gorgeous um the
bronzer maybe is just a little bit too
intense but that's my fault so what can
you do if you liked this video please
give it a big thumbs up and if you want
me to do more as well let me know and
I'm gonna be more than happy to do that
and I love you guys so much and I will
see you in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
