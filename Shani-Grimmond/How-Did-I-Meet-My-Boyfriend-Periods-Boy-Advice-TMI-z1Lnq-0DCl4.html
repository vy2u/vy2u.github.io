my channel it's been a week since I
filmed a video and it's killing me I
missed it so much wait can we just like
excuse the fact that I have it mask on
because I just didn't wanna do my makeup
I ate MacOS for dinner last night and
when I do that I get really bad break
outs because makers is obviously not
very good for your skin so that's why
I'm wearing a mask today and in our
little friends here so let's just sit
down and have a look slimmer party as
some questions so I have been sick over
the last week I had tonsillitis it was
like every single time I swallowed it
was like razor blades going down my
throat it was so horrible I gave my
boyfriend my sickness he was sick as
well for the whole of last week and we
basically just looked after each other
and watched revenge and oh my god I've
nearly caught up to date with revenge if
you guys haven't like heard of it or
seen it it's a TV series about getting
revenge back on someone it is so good
and yeah I'm really depressed that the
season is nearly over or what am I going
to do with my life
I don't know I just don't know okay so
this question I get asked so much and I
was going to wait until like I do a
boyfriend I was something with my
boyfriend to answer this but seriously
coming for the waiting so how did my
boyfriend I meet well we started talking
on snapchat he added me somehow don't
know how we found out my snapchat now
basically we're talking on there and
then we started texting like every day
for freaking ages and then I also be
talking about it and then um we met up
on our birthdays which was completely
accidental I feel like so we have the
same birthdays I was coming out of my
taxi to go to a club and he was walking
to a club and I came out of my car out
of my taxi and he was literally right
there like he was just walking to the
club and I was getting out that I was
like whoa I did not expect to see you
here I was not expecting that at all and
then we just met up at a different club
later on and then we'll literally
together for the next four days straight
and then we had sleepovers for like two
months straight and then we started
dating well next question is how do you
deal with online hate I honestly most
days don't care at all it just goes in
one ear comes out the other because I've
had so much I'm just so used to it and
it was
affect me at all because these people
don't send me hey no you learn basically
nothing about me or they would see is
maybe a 10-second snippet of my snapchat
or like an eight-minute video on YouTube
or like a few messages like I don't
really know who I am so you know don't
take things personally if they don't
know you personally um I think that's
really kind of an important quote to
remember I love that quotes so good if
you get hate from people that you know
obviously that's going to hurt a bit
more because obviously they're doing
know you and stuff and that's when it
hurts the most but I would just say get
their negativity out of your life if
people aren't treating you how you
should be treated you don't need them
girlfriend you don't need them but when
it comes to hate on like Tumblr and
stuff which obviously is where I get the
most because I have anonymous and people
like to hide behind and I'm anonymous
button and just send random because
I have nothing better to do with their
lives and maybe you're feeling bad about
themselves trying to make themself a
better I'm not really sure I can't
understand why people send hate I don't
know what kind of pleasure they get out
of it I can honestly say from the bottom
of my heart I have never sent a hate
message and if I ever sent one I would
not be able to sleep at night I would
have to send them like hundreds of
apologies I would feel so horrible like
I honestly don't get how people can feel
okay after sending someone hate and
making someone feel bad like I don't get
it but when it comes to a tumblr hate
all I do is I just turn my anonymous off
if I'm ever feeling like it's getting to
me most the time it doesn't get to me
but there might be like maybe a day
before I get my period I get PMS I get
quite emotional that's when it gets to
me and I just flick it off until I feel
better but usually I don't give a what
what do you love most about your
boyfriend
well I remember and you guys would
remember when I used to make videos
about how I always used to get stuffed
around and stuff and I always was so
doubtful with boys and I just thought
that all boys were the same but there
are a lot of boys out there that
actually do treat girls with respect and
they do know how to treat girls I do
know how to make them feel special and
wanted and stuff like that so that would
have to be my favorite thing about
Jonathon he makes me just feel special
and really important I don't really know
how to
scriber I can't really wait won't talk
about it because I've never really
talked about him to you guys because
it's only you know we've really been
dating for like a month or something but
yeah I just really appreciate the
respect that it gives me do you have any
relationship advice I do have some
relationship advice my first one it
would have to be make sure the effort is
coming from both sides of the
relationship it has to be 50/50 for the
relationship to work and to be healthy I
feel another thing is don't be
controlling that is the worst I've seen
so many people be controlling no one can
tell you what to do except for your mum
and dad obviously um unless you're 18
then you can do it every freaking one
but being controlling obviously goes to
show you that you don't really have much
trust for your boyfriend/girlfriend and
that is the most important thing in a
relationship to have trust so make sure
you're communicating telling each other
what you do and don't lack but not
controlling like it's really not
necessary I just I I just can't stand
controlling people have some trust and
if you don't have trust then why
together okay I knew this question was
coming it is do like a Vegemite
chocolate I have never tried Vegemite
chocolate I never want to but I thought
to make this video a little bit
interesting I'm gonna try Vegemite
chocolate me haha I'm so scared I don't
even have any water in here oh my god oh
that's so disgusting guys I can't
as she was fasting yeah if anyone
actually lacks that what is wrong with
you huh tampons or pads okay well I like
tampons better just because it feels
like you literally don't have your
period obviously after the tampons up
sometimes it hurts so bad putting a
tampon in and I just can't do it so I
have to put a pad on the reason I like
pads it's because it's literally like a
bladder pool between your jaw and that's
disgusting
it feels disgusting you can fear when it
comes out and if you wear a tampon you
can't feel when it comes out but
sometimes you just go to our pad because
sometimes it just doesn't work
I don't hurt where do I see myself in 20
years well this is where I want to see
myself I want to have my own house I
want it to be beautiful I want to have
my own children I want to have a husband
that tricks me so so well um I want my
parents to still be around I'll be 60 so
they'll still be oh my god that's so
scary thinking that oh my god what is
your favorite age and what advice would
you give to that age I would have to say
my favorite age has been 18 just because
I have my own car I can drive myself
places I can do my everything go
anywhere that makes me happy do things
that make me happy on my own because I'm
independent and I'm an adult now but I'd
have to say when I was in primary school
in high school I wish I could give
myself this advice don't care what
people think of you don't try and fit in
with other people just because you feel
like that's the only way getting it
accepted because I know that I want to
be in the popular group at school when I
was in high school but honestly when you
leave high school it doesn't even matter
anymore
everyone goes their separate ways and
everyone focuses on themselves you can't
care what people think of you because
the only person they should be caring
about what thinks of you is yourself
okay so I'm pretty sure that is all that
I have to say for this video I really
need you guys to leave something in the
comments and I really really really want
to know what video that you guys want to
see next because I'm going to be doing a
week full of videos very soon 22 get a
list of videos I want to film them and
upload them seven days or five days
whatever you guys want anyways have an
amazing
right and I'll see you in my next video
and my face ma should probably came off
like off nagger love you bye yeah hi
