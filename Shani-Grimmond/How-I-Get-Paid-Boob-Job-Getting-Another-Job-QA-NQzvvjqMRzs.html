my channel so in today's video I am
doing a Q&amp;amp;A I haven't done one of these
in the longest time I am so excited so
let's go ahead and get started first I
just like to say I'm so sorry if I have
it lipstick on my teeth throughout this
video it's just something that occurs in
my everyday life all right full force on
the first question it is how do you make
money so I'm sure love you guys know a
picture everyone will notice that
youtubers make money
the first way you can do it and the
easiest way is just what ads in front
your videos so that's called monetizing
your videos and you get paid monthly for
that and then you can do sponsored
videos so you guys would know it for
youtubers doing a sponsored video
because it's probably obvious and B it
will say in the description box if a
video is sponsored so that's where most
of like social media what youtubers may
comes in sponsor videos and Adsense and
then obviously you can get paid to do
Instagram posts you can get paid to do
snapchat you can get paid you so many
things like advertising is such a
powerful it's just like whole of the
world are we adding your header
nothing's coming out next question is do
you think it's good living with your
boyfriend I love answering questions
like this because when I watch like
other youtubers videos and they're not
really personal I get really bored soon
anyways um I do like love living with my
boyfriend it's really different to like
living with a friend because living with
a friend you have to like constantly
clean up after self I felt like when I
was with my old friend I had to lacked
idea popped myself straight away before
they got home and you couldn't like
fully relax
and living with your family conker and a
kid and you've got like rules to follow
and stuff like that um but living with
my boyfriend it's like I can do whatever
I want and I don't have to clean up
after myself like straight away as I
would if I lived with myself
um because he doesn't care and you can
just chill out I clean up up to myself
like the next day by the way I'm not a
pink well what what are you scared of
cutting your hair because I am I am
actually so petrified of cutting my hair
I really want to get like a haircut like
this I think I look really good and I
look just more mature and I can style it
more and I can curl it but I'm so scared
to cut my hair because obviously fan
takes so long to grow back and I've
always had long hair growing up what do
you guys think do you think I should
come here to like here I feel like it's
good I don't know I don't know what do
you think and if you didn't know my hair
goes to my butt oh my god I can't
believe how many people asking if I
wasn't doing YouTube what would I be
doing I've actually like sat down for a
really long time and tried my hardest to
think of something that I really enjoy
as much as I enjoy doing this but
there's obviously nothing like could you
imagine like working in your house and
just having your own rules to your job
and being your own boss and I don't know
like just doing a job that you love like
I love talking to you guys I love doing
makeup and experimenting with new colors
and making your own hours for work you
can have holidays off when you bought
them off I don't know I just like
there's nothing I would rather do the
next question is who is your most
inspirational person in life um your how
like a lot of people have like famous
people or like well-known people as the
inspiration is mine
I was like really happy positive people
I think that's the best kind of people
to be around my old manager was just so
amazing she just had the best outlook on
life so positive and looked at the
bright side of everything and we're so
confident and just knew how to talk to
people that knew how to keep the
conversation flowing and like that's
just like exactly what I want to be so
yeah I guess it's just people in life
that you meet that you aspire to be like
I guess
bindis people keep asking how do i edit
my Instagram photos I don't want to give
my secrets away I'm kidding I'm just
going to show you because I've been
doing this for years and it's like all
I'll ever do so I use the app vsco cam
right here right there and then when I
open it up I use the filter f2 which is
this one down here and then I turn the
exposure down one and that's all I use
that feel for every single photo and no
this is not altered there will always
ask me that when I talk about something
I like the next question is you tend to
get a lot of hate how do you stay so
positive and move away from it oh my god
I honestly do I get so much hate on my
Instagram and YouTube videos and just
constantly like deleting them looking
people in comments um it's something
that I guess having a following you have
to get used to and you have to learn to
not take its heart and it's something
that I'm definitely just learnt to do
I'm sure every pretty much every
youtuber that has a following like a big
following and that does get hit a lot
we're all used to it I mean there's
nothing you can do about it so you're
just going to learn to not take it
personally people try and pick up every
little thing about someone's life to
bring them down and that's just life
people can be awful but I can honestly
say cross my heart
I haven't never ever sent a hate message
to anyone and if I did I honestly I
wouldn't be able to sleep at night out
feels so bad and we're going
I'm apologizing I don't artist it makes
me cringe thinking about like press
Enter
well not how the next question all my
boxes she is or what do you want to
accomplish this year by the way
Italy feeling - um I want to make my own
bikini line and eyelash line that's
pretty much all that sort of for right
now but there's obviously like heaps
more things that I want to do um but
here definitely eyelashes and bikinis I
love beginnings I have so many and I
just want to make my own line so I can
kind of like designer myself and you
know I just have a specific look in my
head that I'm gonna go for and say with
eyelashes I have so many eyelashes
actually learnt because I've used them
all I need to get them but um there's
just a specific type of eyelash that I
like and I want to make them for you
guys I've got my lashes but the next one
is not a question but it's demand it
says do an American accent hey guys so
I'm just gonna go to the beach now with
my dog and I'm gonna take her for a swim
because she really likes swimming um and
then I'm just going to blend my
eyeshadow out I actually really like the
way I did my makeup today I was like I
was like I know and the last question is
digital boobs get bigger from the pill
I've touched base on this before but so
many people constantly say honey you've
got a boob job
why don't you be honest and tell us
Yahoo I have never got a good job I
promise when I went on the pill I went
on it for my emotions because my
emotions were just like well you know
like before you have your period and you
get really sad I was just like that for
constant deflator and I was really sad
all the time so I went on a pill for my
hormones and my acne and it cleared up
my skin it made my emotions normal and
my boobs and I think they grew from the
pill I brushed my boobs grew a bit
before I want to appeal and then they
kept growing when I was on the pill
owner how I supposed to know if your
boobs grew from the pill or from natural
worth maybe I should just ask me babe
hey okay I should stop now
so now we have my QA I'm going to be
doing a lot more of these so the next QA
I'm going to answer questions from the
comments down below so leave as many
weird random invasive comments in the
comments below and I'll answer them for
my next video I hope you guys like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
I'll speak to you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
