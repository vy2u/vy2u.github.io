channel so I'm super excited to be back
assuming my normal videos now I know
I've been away for like a month or
something feelings love so I've been
uploading like just as much but it feels
so good to be like in my room filming
these normal kinds of videos so if you
want to rewind my hands up to the tail
contact my makeup because when I went
out on the weekend I actually changed
like my whole body except my arms
because I was like panning according to
my dress I mean I don't have time to
turn my whole body July so in today's
video I'm going to be showing you guys
how I keep my teeth wide at home so will
disclaimer before we get into the video
I do have veneers on my top teeth so
when I'm saying how I keep my little
Ella oh my god I forget how to film so
what I mean by how I keep my teeth
whiter and I mean my bottom row because
I really need to match up my bottom rail
piece to my chopper otherwise we're
gonna have why you know my feelings like
not not happening at me so I know you
guys would have heard like a million
different people talking about thousands
of different teeth whitening companies
because I know there's so many out there
and there's so many to choose from and
stuff so for me it took me a while to
like figure out who was like loyal like
what company was the best and obviously
what products worked the best so today
I'm working with high smile and they
have a million different like teeth
whitening things that you can use but
but it a figure I'm going to mainly
focus on their new launch which is the
day toothpaste and also the natural
paste which helps whiten your teeth
which a me is incredible because I don't
really like going out of my way and
using my trays and stuff I mean I
definitely will do that if I need to my
teeth are getting super yellow but for
me this is just super easy because it's
already in my like daily routine so why
not just do something that's going to
make my teeth whiter well I'm at it so
we have a few different benefits in both
of them so let's start with a daytime
one this one has a micro backs in the
toothpaste to protect your teeth from
stays and also aloe vera to prevent any
cavities
look how many smells so about heavy
smiles before when someone's talking to
you can smell show up in your grill and
of course it has something in here to
keep the breath nice and fresh it has a
natural peppermint oil so you guys know
how to brush your teeth if you use it
like any normal
truth paste I honestly - my toothbrush
and toothpaste is something I've done
since I was a fetus I mean
hell but I just web putting heaps on and
obviously Russia cheese for like let's
let's Google how long you need a brush
your teeth or exactly because my little
sister brushes her teeth for like 20
seconds and I can get back in there do
it for at least a minute I think it's
two minutes let's see how how long I use
the first brush people three minutes
there you go okay so now moving on to
the night time toothpaste this one is a
little bit on the black side because it
has a natural charcoal in there which is
what makes your teeths go away if you
guys haven't been living under a rock
then you'd know that charcoal is
literally in everything that's good for
you like skincare and all that it just
has so many different benefits in there
so naturally of course opinion it also
detoxifies and mineralized as your teeth
because it has been its height oh my god
I hope I'm saying that right but in
tight clay in it and also it has the
natural what peppermint oil as well okay
so let's get a little bit TMI the other
night Jonathan was like asking for a
kiss and I'm like fine your breath
smells literally like spit like bean eat
food in your mouth in your hair
sometimes like you don't eat or lack
drink anything so your essence like
actual poop it's just so disgusting when
I'm just like I'm just trying to put the
image in your head and his breath like
wasn't the freshest so he had to go by
she's taken this is the first time that
he was using this like night time one
he's like only know why it's my life
breath fresher than normal yes thanks
yeah you can use it every night so I
don't have to think that animal so I
guess the best thing about this product
is that it is cruelty free and vegan
which warms our heart because they're
animals were hurt in the process of
making this a bindi so Mickey cookie oh
and peanut to split it with eat those
salt sesame they literally followed you
everywhere so yeah this is like the
natural alternative it doesn't have like
any harmful chemicals in there so you
know it's not going to be bad for your
teeth which is really nice because
obviously when you do get your teeth
ones there can be quite like harsh mutti
so this is a great alternative I think
so we have a little package right here
so I just want to read a few more
benefit of the bat because there is so
many and that's cereal my mind is not
going to like soak that'll win at once
so it doesn't have any fluoride SLS or
PE gee I have never heard of those in my
life
and it also has five key minerals
included to maintain teeth health which
is incredible wet chemically so my head
until like the day I - one of the
reasons why I got porcelain veneers I'm
sure you guys know stuff like talked
about a few times on my channel that's
because my people wearing down to
nothing so I just didn't take care of
them so now I take this a bottom for her
so seriously like I need them to stay
there click please
so these toothpastes are available on
subscription obviously you need a new
one every month anyway so it just makes
sense so they are doing the first month
for you guys to like try it out it's not
going to cost you anything and you can
cancel the subscription at any time if
you're not loving it but you probably
will soon and if they deliver it
straight to your door which is so
convenient for me because I'm sorry
buddy Alex say horn is modular down so
just quickly I want to touch base on
this teeth whitening kit if you guys
want something a little bit extra so
this is the packaging it's really sleek
and easy I love it and this is what you
use so you have a little syringe with a
gel which is what makes your teeth white
and then this is the tray that has the
LED light right here that's going to
whiten your teeth so basically you just
apply it on the top and bottom row and
then pop it in your mouth for 10 minutes
and you're good to go and you can just
use it like whatever you want every
second day is recommended but um I just
put on the bottom row right here
obviously I don't want to like damage my
veneers or anything so what Amer and I'm
good to go like con thank you so now we
have the video that is how I keep my
teeth white at home as I said before I'm
going to look at it right now
the main problem that I have is like the
yellowness right at the bottom of my
trees like the top of my tea to find
what the stains like start from the
bottom and I honestly hate it so much um
this one truth here if you like looking
at it and thinking what is wrong with it
this one is actually dead so I have to
go into the dentist and get that in
ternary wyden so I'm sure you guys have
like a dead tooth like I do so thank you
matter but if you wanted my I feel like
that because it is dead typically
emotionally dead bye see ya have a
funeral so I really hope you guys found
this video interesting or helpful in any
way shape or form I love you guys so
much I will leave all of the links down
below to all the products that I was
talking about again I would never
promote something that I don't generally
use and love so I hope you guys have an
amazing day and I'll see you in my next
video bye oh my god my hands asleep
