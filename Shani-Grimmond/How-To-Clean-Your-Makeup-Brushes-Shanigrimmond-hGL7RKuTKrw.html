today's video is extremely important it
is about how to clean your makeup
brushes now the main reason as to why
I'm making this video is because the
other day my friend asked me if I could
buy her some more makeup brushes because
um they're apparently falling apart and
looking really tacky and they just don't
work anymore and I was thinking to
myself she only had them for six months
why would they be falling apart and then
it clicked I was like how do you clean
your makeup brushes and she's like no
and I'm like okay so you've had your
brushes for six months and you haven't
cleaned them oh so that is why I'm
making this video I didn't realize how
many people didn't clean their makeup
brushes and for those who don't clean
them it is extremely important it is
like all this bacteria in your brushes
and you going to be transferring onto
your face you want to make sure you
clean it it is honestly so easy you can
do with your eyes closed and the things
that are going to be cleaning my brushes
with today are so inexpensive you could
like find them around your house if not
everything I'm using you'll find around
your house so all you need to clean your
makeup brushes is some baby wipes any
baby wipes will do some Johnson's baby
shampoo you can also use the shampoo and
conditioner which is in the orange the
orange liquid if you're I mean and you
can also use some conditioner and your
conditioner work once again ill that's
what all of me or the water and the last
two things are some olive oil and also
just a paper towel to dry them and just
a towel in general so that is everything
that you need
so obviously you don't have to go ahead
and buy everything that I just showed
you well you've probably got it laying
around your half but if you don't want
to go ahead and buy the Johnson's baby
shampoo you can just use any ordinary
shampoo and conditioner that is in your
shower right now it'll work just as good
but the reason why I am using this is
because it isn't harsh on your makeup
brushes and it's not going to look like
make your skin break out if there's a
little bit of excess conditioner
left all of the brushes so yeah that's
everything that I have to say and if you
don't clean your brushes after this
video watch out you better alright let's
jump into it the first thing that I'm
doing is running some lukewarm water
into a glass and I wouldn't recommend
using hot water as that will damage the
bristles and now I'm just going to be
dunking all of the brushes into the
water sometimes I do get a little bit
lazy and dunk them in all at once but
don't worry it still does the job just
keep in mind when you're cleaning your
make up brushes you don't want to get
this part right here wet as it will
disturb the glue and your brush will
shed and obviously it won't last as long
after I've wet my fingers I'll just go
ahead and put a dollop of the shampoo on
my fingertips and all I do to clean my
brushes is just swirl it in little
circular motions I don't like to put too
much pressure on it because I don't want
to ruin the shape of the brush and yeah
I just keep swelling it and swelling it
until the foam is nice and fluffy and
then if the brush isn't clean I just go
ahead and repeat this process after I
have it rinsed all the product out of
the brush I then go ahead and pinch it
to get all the water out and then I
follow up with just rubbing the brush on
a paper towel to get the rest of the
water off and again I just repeat this
process with all my brushes and it is
extremely time consuming but it's so
worth it if you have a makeup brush that
is extremely stubborn and the makeup
isn't coming off you can go ahead and
take some olive oil because this does
break down all of the makeup and really
does deep condition your brushes you can
just go ahead and do the same process as
you would with the shampoo so I put the
olive oil on your hand rub it in and
then rinse it out and then go ahead with
the shampoo and you know what I mean
girlfriend moving on to my foundation
brush now these are the kinds of brushes
that you want to wash the most often any
brush that you use liquid formulas with
such as foundation or concealers or
anything like that I would recommend
washing them like once a week or once
every two weeks because it does collect
the most bacteria compared to like
powder brushes and stuff like that and
if you don't wash it very often it could
cause breakouts so the same thing
applies I just go ahead and put a dollop
of shampoo in my fingertips swirl it
around and massage the product into my
fingers and all of that good stuff and
then I just go ahead and like do it over
and over and over again until it's super
clean and until the water is snazzy and
clear
if you feel as though your brushes are a
little bit dry you can just go ahead and
add some condition onto your fingertips
just as you would with the shampoo
massage it in rinse it out and your
brushes will be at 10 times softer the
way that you let your brushes dry is
actually really important as I said
before you don't want the water seeping
up to where the glue is otherwise your
brush will shed that is why I folded the
towel up like this you'll see in a
second how I'd do it so all I'm doing is
taking the baby wipes and cleaning all
of the handles to get all the bacteria
off just swirling the brush into shape
and then placing it upside down just so
the water runs onto the towel rather
than up into the glue so there we have
it that is how you clean your makeup
brushes as I said it is so so simple and
inexpensive so if you guys don't go
ahead and wash your makeup brushes in
the next week then I will be at your
doorstep and I'll clean them for you so
