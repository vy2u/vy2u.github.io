channel so in today's video I'm doing a
fully dedicated video to contouring and
highlighting I am so excited because
contouring and highlighting is
everything to me so we're going to start
from the base then we're going to do
cream contouring and highlighting and
also powder contouring and highlighting
so hello me so look at that
starting with the base I'm taking the
simple kind of skin replenishing a rich
moisturizing lotion I would recommend
applying moisturizer before any makeup
application I just think it makes the
products apply a lot smoother on the
face this one is super affordable as
well I really like it now it's time for
the base so I'm taking the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation this is
one of my Holy Grail foundations it's
absolutely incredible this is in the
shade six the perfect shade so I'm just
going to put two pumps on the back of my
hand then I'm going in with a V blender
and I'm just going to blend this evenly
all over my face not obviously you're
not going to blend it unevenly so that's
honestly something wrong with this
beauty blender I'm going to go in with a
flat top brush I don't know what it is
but it's making my foundation patchy my
people never did that usually I love my
blenders now going in with concealer I'm
taking the Born This Way concealer in
the shade light so I always like to go
on with a super light concealer to
really highlight under my eyes and also
to cancel out the discoloration so I'm
just going to a little bit under there
and of course I'm just going to blend
this out with a Beauty Blender as you
can see right here on this side the
concealer has really added a lot of
dimension to my face when it was just
the foundation it's really flat so I
really like to go in with a few shades
lighter and this bonus way concealer is
mint as frogs
now it's time for the super fun part the
cream contour room so I'm taking the
iconic London multi-use contouring set
so this one has a bunch of different
shades that will work with a lot of
different skin tones where's my V
blender so what I'm going to do is I'm
taking this shade right here and I'm
going to contour with this one so I'm
just going to take my Beauty Blender
wipe off that concealer and then I'm
just going to dab it in here and then
we're going to start with a little bit
and we're going to put it directly under
the cheekbone so I don't like to take
the contour anywhere past here otherwise
I feel like if you drag it down too far
it makes you kind of look like a
skeleton and it doesn't look as natural
line up are you playing around with my
tripod hey let's start dabbing with this
product you can really make it super
natural or you can make it intense cream
products are so incredibly easy to work
with I really love this palette so when
you blend this product out you want to
make sure you blend it up if anything
you don't want to blend it under your
cheekbone because that's just going to
defeat the purpose of contouring and
it's going to make it look a little bit
messy as well it is slightly patting her
in as you can see already I have a lot
of color back into my face I love a nice
bronzy look so now we're going to go
around the forehead to warm it up if you
do have a small forehead and you don't
want to look any smaller I would
recommend staying away from putting any
bronzer shades around the forehead if
you want to maybe just like a tiny bit
because it will make it look even
smaller my foreheads pretty large and in
charge so I'm going in with this every
time I do cream contouring I always like
to make sure my hair is like pulled back
really tight because I'd like to blend
it in with my hairline just to make it
look as natural as we possibly can now
going on the jawline to define that just
gonna really put my chin out so it
sticks out for us let's just put a
little contour under the chin so your
double chin wouldn't want to move your
hand mate now going in with the
different side of the beauty blender I'm
picking up this middle shade right here
and I'm just going to put this on top of
my cheekbones just
highlight her I can never have too much
highlight to be honest so I'm not going
to bring this directly under my eyes
because I don't want my concealer to
crease but right under that oh it's so
creamy I just want to eat it is that
weird
I'm also going to put this between my
eyebrows and bring it up here a little
bit add even more dimension and also on
the chin now it's time to set all of
this goodness so I'm taking the makeup
studio translucent powder in one this
stuff is super super fine so it doesn't
cling to the wrinkles under your eyes
which I love so I'm going in with a
sponge and I'm just going to tilt my
head down look up and just pop that
directly under my eyes and we're just
going to do a little bit of baking I
just breathe it in my nostril now that
this product has been sitting under my
eyes for about two minutes I'm just
going to go in with whatever is left on
the lid and just dust this all over my
face I feel like if I don't apply a
powder after my cream contour and go
straight in with like a bronzer or
something it gets super patchy so I love
to do it this show it just makes my face
feel so soft as well
I've probably inhaled like a whole bag
of powder in my life like translucent
powder that's not bad now it's time to
intensify everything even more of course
you can just go in with the cream
contouring but for the sake of this
video I thought I may as well show you
both in the 1 so I'm going in with the
Kat Von D shade and light palette I'm
going to start with contouring so I
haven't used this palette too much with
the contouring shades as you can see how
these are on quite a lot so if you guys
have a similar skin tone to me and you
have this palette please let me know in
the comments below what shade you think
would suit us best so I'm going to go in
with the NARS
either brush and I'm gonna pick up these
two shades here just a little bit at a
time because I know this is pigmented
I'm just going to put this the same
place as we put the cream contour
take the side-to-side and then blend up
and then I'm just going to blend that
out a little bit because pre pigmented
she really pigmented this brush is so
easy to apply contour with I'm also
going to take those two shades down the
side of my nose this honestly takes
three seconds it's it's amazing now it's
time for bronzer and taking the macro
mineralized skinfinish in the shade give
me Sun this is what it looks like it's
super warm it is a little bit orange but
I love the way it makes my skin look so
the brush and I'm applying this with is
the morphe m40 - it is incredible so I'm
just going to take a little bit tap it
off and start from my ear and then work
my way down was because you want most of
the pigments to be up here I love how
this brush is just so fluffy so it
doesn't apply too much at once and I'm
also going to take this around my
hairline as well so it's the most
beautiful beautiful glow going back in
with the Kat Von D shade and light
palette I'm picking up this middle
banana shade and I'm just going to place
this right under my eye just to brighten
it up even more and also in between and
above my brows and then down the center
of my nose and then just going in with
my powder brush and just blending
everything out a little bit now it's
time to clean up that contour line which
is layer 1 my favorite part I'm just
going to dab this in with the tip of the
brush and just drag this right under my
cheekbones to make it nice and harsh you
can also do baking with this it pretty
much works the exact same
so as you can see we have a lot of
dimension and laughs back into my face a
lot of different colors and I freaking
love it obviously you don't have to go
this intense but this is just how I like
to do it so I'm gonna go ahead and
finish my makeup and I'll be right back
okay so I've just finished my makeup I'm
going to finish off this video with some
highlight on my face so the highlighter
type that is shimmery on your cheeks on
my favorite type so I'm going in with
the Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter
in the shade peach nectar I haven't used
this in so long so I'm just going to go
in with this little duo fiber brush and
I'm just gonna pack this right above my
cheekbones just for a nice glow I felt
like it was kind of necessary to put me
applying highlighter in this video if
not the different kind of highlighter to
highlight and contouring but it's still
highlight come on finishing off with the
Urban Decay cooling and hydrating and
makeup setting spray I feel like if your
face is looking a little bit powdery
this just absorbs any excess powder and
it gives a really nice glow to the face
so there we have the video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it I love contouring
and highlighting it's so incredibly much
if you guys want any other dedicated
videos for dedicated sections that
