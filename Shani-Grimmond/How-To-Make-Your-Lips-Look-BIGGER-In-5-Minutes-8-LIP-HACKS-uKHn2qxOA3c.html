channel so in today's video I'm showing
you how to make your lips look bigger in
less than five minutes so this video is
just for a bit of fun your natural lips
are perfect just the way they are
whether they're big or small I just
sought a one at experiment for those who
would find this for your helpful okay
let's go ahead and jump straight into it
the first thing that you can do is go
ahead and take a lip plumping a lip
gloss this one is from a two-faced it is
a very extreme so I'm just putting this
all over my lips including the lip
border and I'm really going in with this
product I'm putting a lot on it has a
really nice glossy finish so you could
just wear this on its own if you want it
to but I'm gonna go even further let me
tell you this like really hurts like for
the first few minutes it's painful but
it's definitely bearable I'm just a bit
of a wimp but anyways leave that on for
five minutes and then the next trick is
putting cinnamon all over my lips so I'm
just laying down some lip gloss and then
packing the cinnamon on top you are
supposed to use ground cinnamon not
cinnamon sugar so make sure you do that
because the sugar doesn't really work
but what the ground cinnamon is supposed
to do is irritate your lips mildly not
too much and it's also going to make
them a bit red as well so I just took a
cloth and rub my lips to exfoliate the
dead skin off at the same time as making
them nice and puffy if you had ground
cinnamon hon okay remember that this one
tastes really good as well okay so now
I'm taking a plastic shot glass make
sure you don't use glass because this
can shut up and really hurt your face so
I'm just very lightly sucking in air
suctioning my lips and making them a bit
more plump this definitely does work
please be careful with this step it can
really bruised your lips and really
stuff them up so just do it very lightly
like I did if you are going to even try
this now I'm just taking a face powder
and brushing this all over my lips I
just find it easier to apply the
lipstick and stuff when I have a very
blank canvas now going in with the Kylie
cosmetics lip liner in the shade at
Dolce K so I'm just using a dark nude
kind of shade I really like her lip
liners just because they're super
buttery so it makes it easy to overdraw
at the lips so what I'm doing is
starting with my top lip and just lining
the border of my lip and I slowly like
to build it up and higher and higher
until it is a tiny bit outside my
natural lip line but not too much
obviously you don't want it to look
natural and then with my bottom lip I
just like to stretch it out so we can
really see what's happening under there
so I'm just going to draw that a little
bit underneath so we can create a bit of
a shadow and when I'm over drawing my
lips I like to focus the over drawing
mainly on the center not on the outer
portion of the lips because that's when
it does start to look a bit fake with
that say matte lip pencil I'm going to
color in the corners of my mouth and
this is going to create the illusion of
the corners at being further away and
then the middle with the latter shades
being closer so it's going to make them
look bigger so what I'm doing now is
just taking a dark nude going over the
top just so it like really stays on for
ages and then I'm going to take my
medium nude and my light nude so with my
medium nude I'm just going to focus this
on majority of the lips but the corners
of course going to stay super dark and
then taking the really light nude so I'm
just going to pop this right in the
center of my lips I will leave all of
the lipsticks that I am using in this
video down below if you guys are
interested because these are some of my
favorite ever so then I'm just going
back in with that lip liner and just
making sure the outline of my lips are
still super dark so we can keep that
definition all right hands let's take
this to the next level so I'm just gonna
take a matte bronzer on a fluffy
eyeshadow blending brush and I'm just
putting this in the fold of my lips so
we can create the illusion of the bottom
lip folding downwards how good is that I
love this one okay so now for the
highlighter trick I'm just going to put
this right on my Cupid's bow with the
over lining job that I did I personally
can't do the highlighting trick but if
you do have like a different lip shape
that will work it does make them look
bigger but just not for me
okay so now we're going to move on to
the lip gloss this is a lip gloss by Mac
it is honestly so shiny it is the
shiniest lip gloss I have ever used in
my life it lasts really long as well so
this is going to give the effect of
really juicy massive lips like this is
the star of the show right here but yeah
there we have the finished lip look I
really hope you guys like it as I said
at the start of the video small lips big
lips whatever you have you are beautiful
you don't need to change anything this
video was very light-hearted just a bit
of fun and for you guys that want to
know how to get bigger lips for the day
here you go I hope it helped you out I
