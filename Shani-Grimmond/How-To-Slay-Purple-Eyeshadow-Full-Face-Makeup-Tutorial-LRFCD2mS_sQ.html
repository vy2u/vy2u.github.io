in today's video I thought how to play
around with a little bit of color
because I always do neutral actually
looks so let's go ahead and jump into it
I'm starting this look off by priming my
eyes with the Maybelline fit me
concealer I love this because it cancels
out all of the veins and also is a great
base for the eyeshadow to sit on top of
so after I've blended that out I'm going
to go ahead and set it with any sort of
translucent powder just to make sure all
the powders that go on over the top just
blend out really seamlessly now of
course it's time to do the eye brows so
I'm taking the Mac fluidline in a shade
at true brunette and I'm just going to
create a little bit of an arch because I
naturally have really straight brows so
I like to kind of make a new shape so
just going ahead and doing my thang Oh
straight eyebrows will be the death of
me after that I'm going to go ahead and
conceal my brows so just take a bit of
concealer that is a few shades lighter
than my skin and drag that under my
eyebrow and also on top my brow just to
make them appear a bit more sharp then
of course I'm going to go ahead and set
my brows with a bit of eyebrow gel just
to make sure they don't go flying around
throughout the day you're not a mean
girl now taking my morphe 35 at P
palette I'm just picking up a medium
brown shade and this is going to be my
transition so just taking this from
inner corner to outer corner this will
just allow all of the other Purple's to
blend up into this one so it's going to
be like a nice gradient otherwise it's
going to be a proper mess
the next shade I'm taking is a light
multi purple so I'm putting this on a
smaller blending brush and just focusing
more in the crease again it's just going
to allow the other colors to blend up
easier because purple is kind of a
really harsh color to work with so I'm
just starting light and then getting
more intense so now taking this really
intense purple shade again on an even
smaller blending brush and just working
this from inner corner to outer corner I
honestly just sat there for so long just
to make sure I didn't put too much on at
a time so small amount by small amount
and then slowly work your way up and
just diffuse it so it gets later and
later don't forget to blend away any
edges so there's no harsh lines now for
the lid color and picking up this
beautiful beautiful shimmery purple this
is going on the inner corner and the
outer corner of the lid and we're going
to leave the middle spare for a really
nice pop of light purple these colors
were super easy to work with I just made
sure that my brush was wet with fixed
plus before I went in so they were even
more pigmented so now I'm taking the
star of the show look how pretty this
light purple is I'm just packing this
directly on the middle of my lid to
create a halo eye and of course
finishing off with a bit of a blend now
it's time for the base so I'm taking the
pixie flawless PD primer this one is
really pretty because it's iridescent
and adds a really nice glow to the face
so just melting this into my face with
my fingers then moving on to foundation
I'm taking this Milani foundation and
look out dark it was is definitely like
two shades too dark for me but I just
worked with it I put a lot of light
concealer on to lighten it up so don't
worry later on it's going to look okay
but this was my first time using it and
I was so impressed with the consistency
and just the coverage and the finish it
was a really really good foundation and
I can't wait to keep using it I might
just have to invest in a lot of shade
anyways it moving on to concealer I'm
taking the Maybelline fit me concealer
once again I'm literally obsessed with
this stuff it just like evens out under
the eyes it highlights it just does
everything I want it's not cakey it's
just so beautiful
so this is the part where I like my
whole face with concealer I feel like it
worked really well it just took a lot of
blending with my good old Beauty Blender
now I'm taking my NYX HD finishing
powder and let me tell you I had really
bad flashback with this when I had a
flash on when I was taking selfies so I
would definitely not recommend this
stuff which is really unfortunate but
anyways moving on to the lower lash line
I'm taking that same purple crease color
just putting this from inner corner to
outer corner on my lower lash line
really some welcome nut at then I'm
going in with that mob and just blending
out under the purple so it kind of
diffuses it a tiny bit and then lastly
I'm taking that purple again the
server's show and putting that in the
middle of my lower lash line and boom we
add anthe a shadow moving on to mascara
I'm taking the covergirl the super sizer
I love this one and yeah I'm just gonna
coat my lashes you know the drill girl
oh my god guys you're gonna die this
stuff is so pigmented it's a liner from
colour-pop it was just so opaque and it
lasted such a long time I am very very
impressed with this so now I'm just
going to coat my lower lashes I love to
put heaps and heaps um scar on my top
and my bottom but especially on my
bottom because I always gone with
falsies these ones are from Lily lashes
I'm just gonna pop these bad boys down
and I didn't realize the inner corner
was flicking up until the end of the
video so I do fix it at the end if you
are noticing right now and it's killing
me - killing me - moving on to a bit of
contouring i'm taking this contour
powder by Bobbi Brown I love this stuff
so much I've used it a lot and I haven't
even hit pan yet which I'm very very
happy about because slowly Brad can be
really expensive okay so I'm using the e
to brush by NAS and this just applies
contour so prominent I love it I'm also
going to go in and fix my nose up a
little bit just kidding when I was
actually really small I don't know why I
bought that but it's fun so now to
bronze up the face I'm taking this Mac
bronzing powder just putting this around
my forehead under my cheekbones and my
jaw bone just
a bit of a sunkissed glow to the face
now it's time for blush I'm taking this
blush from NAS in the shade a luster
this is one of my Holy Grail blushes
it's so stunning and so shimmery it just
adds a nice pop of peach to your cheeks
so just putting this on the apples of my
cheeks and then blending it back sorry
for highlighter I'm taking this one it
from colour-pop it is really pretty but
you do need something wet on your brush
virtue apply really intensely like I
like it intensely probably not a word
I'm so sorry my vocabulary is shocking
anyways I'm just gonna spray that fix+
on there and then really work it all
over my face and woah it looks so good
so I'm putting this on top of my
cheekbones on top of my brow Dinos oh I
keep it so you another drill for the
lips today I'm taking this color pop
ultra matte lip in the shade Chee it is
so stunning I love it so much I recently
just got a bunch of stuff from
colour-pop and everything is like up my
alley so just applying this all over my
lips I'm trying my best to overdraw them
as much as I can because I love that big
juicy lip so for the middle of my lips
I'm taking this Anastasio Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick in the shade
just to make that other liquid lipstick
a little bit lighter just so it can
match the purple eyeshadow a litte more
because we can't have the lips looking
too dramatic because eyes aren't crazy
so I'm just going to finish off by
spring my face with the slay or day
setting spray and it burnt my eyeballs
so buy a girl so I'm just putting some
eye contacts in and we are done I hope
you guys enjoyed this makeup look I
really like how it turned out especially
for something kind of different I love
this purple eye shadow palette it was
just incredible to work with it so yeah
if you guys like this video please give
it a big thumbs up I love you so much
and I will see you soon and I'm gonna
start posing now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
