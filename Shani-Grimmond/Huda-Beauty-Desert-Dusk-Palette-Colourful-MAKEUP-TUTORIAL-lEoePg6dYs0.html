channel so in today's video I'm doing a
makeup tutorial on it this look right
here I had it so much fun filming it
because I played around some new
products and new colors and all of that
good stuff so don't forget to subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video okay so let's go ahead and start
with cleansing the face and prepping it
for the makeup because you obviously
want your base to look flawless so I'm
starting out with the Dermalogica pre
cleanse a balm this one is brand new and
it is so good I'm sure a lot of you guys
know that you're supposed to cleanse
your face twice a day but a lot of
people don't realize that a single
cleanse isn't gonna get all the makeup
and oils and like long-lasting makeup
and stuff off your face so it is very
important to double cleanse so this one
is really going to break down everything
and get all of the gross stuff out of
your skin that you do not want there and
it also has like a beautiful luxurious
barmy texture so when you rub it into
the skin it feels so good it also has a
very gentle formula but it does the
cleanser skin nice and deeply but it's
not like too harsh for the skin but yes
I like to use this in the morning - just
like prep my skin for makeup to get all
the oils off and then at night time I
like to use it as an makeup remover
because it literally breaks down all
that makeup so quickly so now I don't
need to use makeup wipes because my skin
gets all dry from that the next step of
course is just to rinse my face and go
in with my favorite cleanser this one is
also from Dermalogica so I'm just gonna
really massage this into my skin for
about a minute rinse it off and then we
are ready for the makeup so today I'm
using the mellow cosmetics brow pomade
this one is really good for making those
browser super defined so I like to make
my arch nice and high and really just
fake a brow shape because I mean my brow
shape is pretty cooked at the moment
because all my eyebrows hair has
completely fallen off the face of the
earth amazing the next step is to go in
and carve out my brows so this really
helps the shape of my brows to make them
look nice and defined and actually have
a little bit more shape you know so the
concealer I'm taking is from nas but I
will leave all of the names of the
products down below if you guys are
interested in any of that so of course
I'm just gonna pry my eyelids to make
sure there's no veins visible and to
make sure all the eyeshadow is just
looking bangin on top you guys know the
drill I always go in with my Rimmel
stain
powder to set that concealer to make
sure it's not wet or tacky oh my gosh
okay now we can go in with a hooded
Beauty palette so this one is the desert
dust palette oh wow I really wanted to
use some more like dramatic colors today
so I'm gonna start with a cool brown and
this one's going directly in my crease
just so we can like start the colors
like I'm not gonna start dramatic I'm
gonna start soft and then build my way
up so just taking this from outer corner
to inner corner on a big old fluffy
blending brush so the next color I'm
taking is this beautiful rich purple and
I'm gonna focus this on the outer half
of my crease so I'll start by blending
that just in my crease and then I'll
start blending it down onto my lid as
well and then fluffing out the edges of
course so it is nice and blended now
taking this beautiful orange shade I'm
gonna pop this on my inner corner of my
crease all the way to the middle of my
crease so I want to show you this for
something a little bit different I
haven't done this before and I thought
it would look really cool because I'm
playing with colors and all of that so
once that's blended in there softly I'm
gonna take that nice concealer again and
carve out a little cut crease so I'm
just doing a half cut crease today and
I'm using a little tiny concealer brush
so we can get that as neat as possible
oh my god this color is honestly it's so
beautiful so I'm gonna pop this all over
where I put that concealer and it's just
gonna make that color pop even more
having that base down you know what I
mean so it's really opaque and that's
exactly what I want so I'm gonna blend
that into the purple and make sure it
kind of like blends into one color but
oh my god I'm dying this is amazing now
it's time to prime the face so we can
have perfectly smooth flawless skin so
I'm taking these still a primer and I'm
just gonna brush this all over my face
usually I use my fingers so like the
warmth of my fingers can really make it
and melt into the skin but like I always
have I shudder or something weird on my
fingers so I always have to use a brush
but let's move on to the foundation I'm
taking the designer brands luminous
hydrating foundation today was actually
the first time that I use it and I
really liked how it looked on my skin
especially because of the shade this is
like a beautiful golden goddess vibe
that I'm getting from this shade so my
10 had faded a little bit so I did have
to bring it down my neck but it made my
skin feel so hydrated and
really nice medium to full coverage but
I will keep you guys updated on what I
think of it in the future because
obviously I'll keep using it but first
impression I was very impressed so let's
move on to the concealer I'm taking that
same at nasse concealer and just packing
this under my eyes giving myself a
little bit of a highlight you know how
it's girl and taking that on my Beauty
Blender as per usual and then I'm going
in with my Kat Von D lock-it setting
powder and I'm just gonna use this to
bake underneath my eyes so we have zero
creasing because that would be bad I
always crease under my eyes unless I
bake so I have to do that every time and
of course I'm gonna set the rest of my
face to make sure it isn't oily looking
I do like having a hydrated looking face
but like in photos it just looks oily so
I'm just like whatever I'm gonna make my
face matte and that's gonna do for the
lower lash line I'm taking this
beautiful a burgundy shade I wanted to
add a little bit more color and this was
so beautiful the formula of these eye
shadows are good it just blends out like
butter makes me so happy next step is to
go in with some colorful eyeliner so
this one is from colour-pop and I'm just
gonna put this in my waterline just for
a little bit more of a pop of color you
know how does girl now taking my Tod
lights camera lashes mascara I'm gonna
Curt my top and bottom lashes so we can
get ready for some falsies so I'm just
gonna take my favorite lashes which
actually lost the book so don't even
know where they're from but I really
like how the sweep of fluffy so take
your favorite dramatic lashes pop them
on and then we can go in and set the
brows so this brow gel is from Miller
cosmetics I'm just gonna push my brows
upwards so they look nice and full and
Harry he loved that vibe you know
next step is to Brunn's the face so I'm
taking this bronzer buy it go line this
is like a beautiful Orange II sunkissed
lookin bronzer as you guys know I love
that kind of look on the cheek so I'm
gonna take a stippling brush and just
brush this under my cheekbones to give a
really glowy look to the face sorry I'm
also gonna take that around my hairline
to proportion out all of those shades we
want the face to be nice and bronzy all
year round thinking going in with this
blush from covergirl this one is it's so
pretty because it has like little
shimmers in it so it really makes the
cheeks glow and I just wanted to add a
bit of pink to make you know everything
kind of come together so
sley for the cheeks I'm taking this
highlighter from Dersim colors which is
the desi X Katy collection oh my god
this is so amazing it literally looks
wet when you put it on the skin like it
is so beautiful and this color is
perfect for my skin tone let me just say
that I also use one of their lipsticks
from the collection as well and let me
just say the formula is so amazing and
creamy but the color didn't really suit
my skin tone so I had to go in with a
lip gloss over the top to kind of add
more of a pinky tinge to it so this
one's from essence it is so good and so
affordable so there we have the finished
a makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it I love you so much and I'll
see you in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
