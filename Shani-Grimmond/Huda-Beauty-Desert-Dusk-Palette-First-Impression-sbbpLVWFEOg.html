channel so in today's video I'm doing a
first impression and review on the huda
beauty desert dusk
palettes for this one just launched and
I'm super excited to see how this goes
because her first palette is like hands
down my favorite palette in the entire
world all the eyeshadows are so creamy
pigmented and just like the formula is
out of this world so I'm hoping that
this one is just as good if not better
so the color selection in here is a very
beautiful it's definitely a lot
different to the first palette there's
still a lot of warm colors in here
there's a few cool tones and I'm really
diggin it like it's very very different
and there's so many different looks that
you could create with all of the colors
in here it's very diverse so I've heard
a few mixed reviews on this palette so
I'm super excited to see what I think of
it so let's go ahead and jump right in
I'm just gonna prime my eyes and I'll be
back so I guess the first call that I'm
going to take is this one right here and
I'm just gonna pop this in my crease I
heard they're a bit powdery so hmmm not
true oh yeah it is pretty powdery all
right let's do this I don't think this
one be like dark enough for my crease
but I'll be nice to kind of like start
everything off just for a very light
transition okay so that one's definitely
not dark enough so I'm gonna take the
shade to eat in right here this one's a
beautiful curly peach shade actually
love the color of that and this one's
gonna go right in my crease oh that's so
amazing
woah this is literally blending out just
like but all it's a very light shade so
it's perfect for the transition I
honestly missed using the hoodie Beauty
eyeshadows I kind of stopped using them
for a bit cuz like I've used the shades
and a million times from the other
palette but it's nice to have a new
palette I'm gonna be basic AF and use
all the warm tones in here because I
want to make a really beautiful look so
the next car I'm taking is and buy this
one right here it's like a ready earthy
tone and this one is going in my crease
to darken it a little bit sir I will do
another look with this palette of course
if you guys want to see that with like
all the other shades in here
mmm it's pigmented well so I'm just
gonna take this up around my crease and
going back in with that peachy color I'm
just gonna use that to blend out the
edges just so what blends into kind of
like one color up here next up I'm going
to be taking the darkest color in the
palette this one right down here this is
a beautiful chocolatey brown color so
I'm gonna pack this on the outer third
of my eye and on there um add a crease
area
well that's very dark I don't like that
we do have a little bit of fallout
happening so it is a bit powdery quite
powdery I always do my eyes first anyway
so if there ever is any fallout I'm like
totally fine with that okay so for the
lid color I'm gonna be taking a blood
marine this one right here this one
looks like a foiled shutter so that
means I'm gonna use my finger oh that is
very pigmented so I'm just going to Pat
this on my okay I think I can use a
brush for that because it's not giving
me those like wet eye shadow vibe so I
think this is gonna be fine with a brush
oh my god that's amazing when it's
actually on the eyelid I feel like it's
not like very shimmery at all mmm
I'm gonna get some fixed place and see
if it works a bit better with that
and what I literally just made that
foiled by putting fixed clasp on that so
much better okay so I would definitely
not use that I showed it without
anything underneath her like with the
fixed plus or like a glitter glue or
something unless you want like a really
subtle sheen on the lid cuz that's all
you're gonna get okay so everything is
on except for the lashes so let's go
ahead and finish the lower lash line so
if I was to be doing like any ordinary
look where I want to look my best then I
would definitely go with like this these
two on the lower lash line so that's
what I'm gonna do today so I'm gonna
start with the shader amber and just
gonna fall off this under here okay and
I'm just taking that on a regular sized
a blending brush because I want it to
kind of come down so it's nice and smoky
and then on the outer corner I'll take
the darkest Brown and just blend it out
yeah oh my god do you know how exciting
it is funny and you palette that's like
amazing like okay so lastly for the
eyeshadow I'm gonna go in with this
sparkly light gold color right here I'm
just gonna pop this on the inner corners
just for a bit of a glow in there and I
think dramatic I just want to be very
soft
that's pretty it has like chunky bits of
glitter no I really like that very
unique that's like a very very soft
sorry if you want something very
dramatic select a lid I'd probably stay
clear for that one but for a little bit
of a glow on the inner corners that's
beautiful I'll just go ahead oh my god I
just had a big tickle on my heard I hate
when that happens so I'm gonna go and do
my lashes and I'll be right back with
you guys here we have the finished a
makeup look I really hope you guys like
how it turned out I'm actually obsessed
with how it looks like this would have
to be one of my favorite looks I've ever
done the shutters blended out so
beautifully I feel like I just blend it
out for me a few of the colors were a
bit powdery but if you do your eyeshadow
first and you're obviously not going to
have any problems with that because you
can just brush it away they're so
pigmented buttery just like the first
pilot and I'm there
very impressed with all the colors in
here because because you imagine how
many different looks you could use with
this palette like it's so versatile and
make sure you guys let me know down
below in the comments or what look you
want me to do next we have like purples
we have I mean like we have everything
so bottom line is that this would have
to be a very high up there in my
favorite pellets the first huda beauty
pellet was my favorite this is probably
my second favorite palette in the whole
world
not gonna lie so obviously I need to
give the other colours a chance like I'm
getting rid of head of myself right now
but if you guys liked this video please
give it a big thumbs up because it helps
me out so so much and don't forget
