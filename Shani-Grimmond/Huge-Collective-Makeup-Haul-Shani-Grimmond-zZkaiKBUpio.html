channel so in today's video I'm doing a
makeup haul I freaking love makeup hauls
because new makeup and just talking
about new makeup that's my life
so let's excuse the fact that my hands
are like ten shades actual light art
than my face we're just gonna have to
get through that together let's get
started oh my god I'm so weird okay so I
want to start with things that I got
from makeup geek because I'm the most
excited about that I've used makeup geek
eyeshadows in a few of my tutorials now
but I want to share in this whole so I
could kind of talk more about it so
makeup day actually reached out to me
and asked if I wanted some of this stuff
and I was like yes
are you kidding because I've heard so
many people talk about makeup geek
products so I've got my hands on them
and I'm so excited to share them with
you because these are the best products
I've used in my whole entire life who I
would buy every single thing here with
Mary money without the flop and doubt so
let's do this the first thing I have
here is the Z palette so your back is
the appellate separately I'm pretty sure
it was around 20 dollars or something
and then you get the eyeshadows they're
actually magnetic and you just like pop
them in like that so yeah I have a bunch
of eyeshadows here these are the nurse
pigmented creamy eyeshadows I've ever
ever laid my eyes on I'm pretty sure
they're around $10 so they're so
affordable
everyone compares them to the Mac
eyeshadows I have only like two micro
shutters but from the ashes I have in
there from Mac these all over the
Mac products seriously these eyeshadows
are so so much better
I am never impressed so the first two
rows are just the normal eye shadows and
these two as well and then all of these
ones are the foiled eyeshadows so all of
them extremely pigmented especially the
foil - especially the foil - shudders
when you swatch them once that is what
you get it is ridiculous I remember I
switched them on my tweet out and I was
like dude look at this okay okay just
look at this for a second this is the
black right I'm gonna put my finger in
ones I'm gonna just shut up about these
now I also picked up summer makeup geek
blushes I have these ones in the pan as
well
I'm gonna add those into my seed pellets
so I'll list the colors down below but
that all really really nice vidi vidi
unique kind of colors I don't have any
like these so I thought a lot of others
to my collection the next thing that I
have here is the steel art wants to
correct skin tone correcting and
brightening serum so it has pink purple
and green to counteract the kind of red
in your face so I thought I would pick
this up and see if it would be any good
and so far I'm liking it I mean I could
never really tell if a primer works or
not so I guess I should try like one
side my face with primer and one side
with that so then I can actually until I
think that's what I'm gonna do next
thing we have here is the hourglass veil
mineralized I'm sorry that's not what
it's called the hourglass veil mineral
primer okay so this little boy right
here I was like $60 for the Beast I was
like mmm girl I don't know if I should
pay that much for this little tiny
primer what I did because so many people
talked about it and I'm such a follower
when it comes to makeup I just buy
whatever what everyone else is buying
what everyone else says it's good
because obviously it's good so yes when
I put this on my face it looks like my
face is glowing it is so confusing I
don't really know if you're gonna
understand what I'm saying we also have
the Mac pigment in the shade Rose is a
beautiful pink pigment that has like
gold reflexes I think I don't really
know when the light kind of changes it
does change car a little bit the thing
that I don't like about the Mac pigments
is that you get so much product I wish
it was just like literally one third so
you get like that much because I'm not
going to use this whole thing in my
whole entire life not even if I did
every person's makeup on this planet I'd
probably still have half a ten left
right here we have these stealer
eyeliners I got the black one and then a
gold one what are these even called
they're called smudge stick waterproof
eyeliners this one is in the shade
gilded
that's a weird name and this one is in
the shade stingray huh that's pretty
cool so they're both so so pigmented and
they do last a pretty long time I've
only used the black one but I can still
say that this gold one is absolutely
gorgeous oh my god so pigmented
this is like a really nice metallic gold
so I'm impressed with that one and the
black one is just like a standard black
eyeliner I need to get a new one because
the one that I have now is like falling
apart shreds so yeah I got those didn't
I yep we also have it these steel are um
magnificent oh my god did I just say
that I did not magnificent a metal eyes
in the shade kitten this is a very
metallic gold champagne color and I have
tried this once it was searched I can't
speak right now it was really really
chunky when I tried to apply it on the
eyes so I do need to practice a bit more
before I do a tutorial because I'm just
like all over the place with it but it
is really pretty and sparkly and
glittery and yeah I thought about this
to my collection because I don't have
anything sparkly and it also comes with
like this formula that you mix with it
I also have two mascaras from eiko I
bought one of them and the other one was
sent to me so I bought the fat brush
mascara being bold and to be honest I
really really do not like this it
doesn't add volume to my lashes this is
just a mascara that I would recommend
for like a school like you don't need a
fancy new sky just like a little bit to
make them look a bit black and a tiny
tone bit longer so the brush is really
fat and just I don't know it just
doesn't work for my eyelashes I guess if
you have a really thick eyelashes this
would work but I've got like thin short
eyelashes honey and that's just not
gonna work the next one is the I do
mascara lengthen and strengthen by Ike
rate this is one of the best mascara
I've ever used so I'm really happy that
they actually sent me this one because
otherwise they would have just been like
standoffish with Aiko but yeah I'm
really really impressed with this one
the wonder is very different to a normal
one they'll turn weird but um the
formula is quite wet so they're the kind
of formulas I like to make my eyelash is
kind of a little bit clumpy because I do
have short lashes and I do like them to
be very very long and this is a Mersenne
we also have the hoola bronzer by
benefit I already have one of these this
is a backup one that they sent
and I was like oh my god yes because I
was gonna have to buy a new one anyway
because it is one of my favorite contour
shades it has just always scratched it
there's a chunk out in there okay
that's something like a Peter Griffin
love that love was so ugly I'm sorry
guys but yeah it's just the perfect
shade it doesn't look ashy or dirty or
money on my face it just makes my cheeks
really defined and sharp and boom my
camera is going flat what a surprise we
also have this Sigma eyeshadow in a
shaded topaz I never tried to Sigma I
obviously have silly I've got the warm
palette and I love that so this is a
really nice warm color it is matte it
has I feel like it has a few Sherman's
throughout it but when you swatch it you
can't see the shimmers I'm quite
confused but I'm yeah I always love
Sigma eyeshadows so thank you seeing
them they also have the eye shadow in
the shade Shep's oh my god guys look at
that that is the craziest oh my god
that's pigmented the craziest burr
artists eye shadow I've ever seen in my
life we also have oh my gosh my stomach
just crumbled so loud
Courtney and I have like no food in the
cupboard because we've been lazy and
haven't gone shopping moving on I've got
the cheeky powder blush and this is in
the shade
cheeky my dad this is a blush that
reminds me a lot of Melba by Mac I think
a lot of blush is runny of that just
because it's super Universal it can
match like any skin tone it's just like
a nice warm pink color a rosy pink and I
think there's kind of blushes the ones
that you need at least one of this is
what I have on today I can't really see
it because I didn't put too much on I've
got the whole contour going on today
yeah I do love adding blush to the face
just to add some warmth and some
rosiness and I just think it's really
pretty and extremely pigmented
and it blends nicely the next thing we
have is a gel eyeliner and this is any
shade liver mmm literally twisted stand
at eyes so I've never used a sigma gel
eyeliner this is a nice brown color
quite excited to use that actually I
suck so bad at eyeliner by usage Elle
eyeliner for the
10 a birthday actually worked out so
well so that's awesome that I've got
that I've never said the word awesome oh
I have but not for a few years and now I
feel like we're going back to 2010 um we
also have the sick I need to stop saying
um are you guys thing you know wait with
that because I'm getting so annoyed also
we have the vivid olaplex a lipgloss by
stigmata say a very nice coral a pink
color I think this is perfect you add on
top of lipsticks you give a nice glossy
finish to the look mm-hmm also is
extremely pigmented so you could
definitely definitely just use it on its
own for like kind of an everyday lip
gloss I think that's quite pretty
wait is it smell come on girlfriend give
me some nice scented a semester
oh that smells like amazing that
actually smell my camera does diamond I
was telling you how nice this smelled
rude it smells really good guys whoa
okay so the next thing I have here I'm
actually so excited to share with you
guys because I love it so Eva and some
of your brushes of my favorite brushes
ever so these are the roll these are the
rose gold eye shadow brushes we have a
bunch of our shadow brushes here and
these are literally the only ones that
I've been using it basically has every
single eye shadow brush that you need in
your whole entire life we've got some
eyeliner ones we've got um blending
brushes flat shader brush is crease
brushes angled brushes we've got it all
honey it's all sort of for you so if I
could recommend any brush set to you it
would be this one I love you okay Robin
Hill and I'm a little bag that it comes
with is very nice I feel like it's gonna
be a really nice pencil case to school
if you guys are still in school if you
like I bet I've got my zoeva brush set
here Jake's sisters pencils next thing I
have is the nude
don't hate when your lip like has skin
peeling off it I don't know if that's
gross to say but it happens meal time
the bomb dude going to you palette so
all these colors are extremely gorgeous
my favorite one is flirty and feisty I
think they're stunning
um fit and sir come on they're all
really nice colors all very wearable and
just neutrals and I love me some neutral
colors these artist pigment tender or as
buttery as I say about areas in my show
then I was pimenton as the makeup geek
eyeshadows I feel like my standards are
extremely high right now because ever
since I touched them I was like not
using any other eyeshadows girl but yeah
these are really pretty colors and I
think I'm gonna get a lot of use out of
this maybe not just some lip products I
have the bomb read my lip lip glosses I
have two and the first one isn't a shade
well which is a extremely extremely
pigmented red color so I feel like this
would be really nice if you had a red
lipstick on and you just like pop this
over the top and you just have like an
amazing red gloss I mean come on
that is so pigmented and it smells Oh
pick up it smells absolutely it smells
absolutely to die for like seriously
that is so pigmented
what more can you ask for and you just
stop saying that word for my quarters my
finger no the next one is in the shade
at pop which is a really nice coral
color I think this is something that
would be nice like everyday wear just to
add some color to your lips so this
again on our website this is pigmented
it's kind of a bit more fierce oh yeah
it's definitely appropriate for everyday
wear the next thing we have is by nude
by Nature okay I have a story about this
but first let me show you the lipstick
this is a lipstick in the shade chic and
I would say this is like a pinky more
the kind of nude color this is
definitely like an everyday lipstick
that I can see myself wearing it smells
like an absolute butthole but that's
just what you have to deal with these
days with lipsticks because they all
smell pretty bad okay so I would say
like three years ago when I was like 12
no I was like 14 years old um you're in
that advertisement said on TV and like
it was like a nude bang H advertisement
TV and it said just call this number and
you get all this makeup for free and
then you like will come pick it up once
you're finished it all so here I was
hello I would like the Spree makeup and
then three weeks later I called
like hey can you come pick up the makeup
now I've like finished trying it out and
you know you don't have to pay they
didn't ask their phone so I got a
message in the mailbox saying honey
Grumman has to pay $400 and if you're at
Kate is $400 in the next two weeks then
you have to go to court
so I was like I'm really sorry mom but
actually I had no idea I'm really sorry
so yeah I've never really had the best
relationship with a nerd okay so we also
have nothing from Sigma not my bad
this is the polished in agreement right
now so this is just a eyeliner it's just
like a nudie Matt you can't even see it
because it's that nude it's just like a
skin color basically and I love these
type of eye lines to put on the
waterline to make your eyes here you go
your girls love that oh my gosh in
the swear jar
I also have some eyeliners by the balm
these are called mr. right now we have a
flesh train one which other said just
before I freaking love those ones to
make your eyes appear bigger these are
very pigmented and they stay on for so
long so long i swatch it on my hands and
then I wash them and I'm like dude it's
not coming off my hands it was on for
like another day and I was like come on
also have a brown color a golden bronze
and a blac wait is that black yeah
that's black I will list the colors down
below I can't be bothered reading them
out right now um okay this is I picked
up the Real Techniques sponge right
because everyone uses it right mm-hmm
sorry I put it under the water it got a
little bit fed up try to apply a makeup
and my makeup just look really patchy
and it just didn't work for me this did
not work for me on anything sorry about
it oh my god do you guys ever watch
