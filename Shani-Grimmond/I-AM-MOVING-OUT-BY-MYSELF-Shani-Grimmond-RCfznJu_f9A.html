and one brown hmm bollocks better blue
or melee black hey guys welcome back to
my channel so this is the last video
that I'm filming in this room it's kind
of sad but I'm so excited to move and
have new filming space and it's bigger
space and so today I'm doing a
question/answer video to kind of kick
off this room to say our farewells and
leave on a good question answer's no I
love filming these videos so I just
asked you guys on Instagram to ask me
questions so let's have a look at what
you're asking the first question is is
there any competition between young
Chloe definitely definitely no
competition away the complete opposite
we like help each other out we promote
each other we support each other yeah I
would definitely say like zero
competition and I'm sure she would say
the exact same thing I know that she
would say the exact same thing actually
when I was in high school um there was a
few friends that I was really
competitive with and I hated it like I
hate being competitive but it kind of
pushes me to do better but I would
definitely say with like the friends I
have now I'm not competitive with and
I'm glad because I don't really like
being competitive with friends anyway
okay so the question that is asked like
so much on tumblr is how come I'm moving
out of my house and to be honest there's
kind of like two reasons the first one
is the most important and the main
reason I'm moving and that's just
because I want a bigger space like this
house is literally so freakin small like
I feel like I'm in a shoebox I don't
know like when my dad first moved in
here he's like this house is so small
and I'm like no it's not too bad but now
I'm like literally I feel suffocated in
here because it is literally like this
big and I can hardly fit in my house
so yeah I'm getting a house that has
like three bedrooms I have like my own
filming room I have my own bedroom was
like a walk-in wardrobe then I'll have a
spare room and like it's just gonna be
so much bigger and I do live on my own
just because I'm a kind of person that
loves being on my own like I am always
on my own it's kind of weird but that's
just who I am so because I love being on
my own so much I feel like it'd be so
much better if Cortney and I went our
separate ways like just how it used to
be like we used to be so inseparable and
hang out like every single weekend and
go
do things together but now that we live
together I feel like we don't like we
don't do that anymore so if we live in
our own houses it's just going to go
back to how it used to be which is how I
want it to be I just feel like living
with friends is like put such a strain
on a relationship I know some people it
might work but it's just like I do not
want to live with any of my friends ever
again just because I want my friend time
when I want it to be and my learned time
when I want to be so yeah I just think I
don't really know if this is coming out
the wrong way but I really really want
things to go back to normal with Cortney
and I and I really want a bigger space
so yeah hope you guys can understand
that by freaking love Courtney and
nothing's changing I still love her
next question is have you ever stolen
anything this is so embarrassing but I'm
100% honest always and I'm gonna be
honest with this question when I was in
grade I think it was five I was really
really young I stole a $3 headband from
Sur pray I don't know what came over me
I don't know why I didn't just pay for a
three dollar headband I feel like I was
just in the wrong friend group and my
friends were stealing so I stole a
headband which was so stupid and I did
get caught and I'm bad perhaps to pray
for life but I still go in there because
I was like literally from the genes
occur but I would never ever do that
again
it was just the most cheapest thing ever
and if you can't afford something then
don't get it the next question is what
do you do with yourself during the day I
always wonder this that's actually good
question I get asked all the time so I
usually film every day or every second
days so I really just work around that
so I wake up around 8:30 9:00 and then I
go straight to the post office get my
mail because I work with a lot of
companies and they send me lots of stuff
then I come home and make breakfast and
then you know brush my teeth wash my
face moisturize this is like my morning
routine in a speaking form and then I
film edit upload I clean a lot of the
time I swear to god half my life is just
based around cleaning because when I'm
filming it just takes so much like I
just take everything out of its place
because I need it and I never put it
back in till like I cleaned so I clean a
lot and then
with the rest of the time I see you like
my friends or my family or anything I
don't really like sitting around like if
I am sitting around and watching TV
series I usually do that at nighttime so
yeah the next one is do you the next one
is that do you see you and Joe know
being together for a long time or is it
too early to tell um I have never been
the person to be like I'm going to be
with this person forever um but I'm also
not the person that's gonna be like oh I
don't think we're gonna be together for
long like I'm just taking one step at a
time one day at a time I don't know
what's going to happen um but all I wish
for is for myself to just be happy and
you know to be happy with who I'm with
and at the moment I'm so happy with with
Jonathan and our relationships so you
never know what's going to happen the
next one is would you ever write a book
or create your own makeup line I would
100% do that that would be amazing I
don't really know what I would write a
book about I would definitely have to do
some brainstorming for that
um but for a makeup line I would love to
come out with some brushes or some
eyelashes or like under anything really
like would you guys be interested in
that because that's something I would
definitely be interested in like
creating I also really want to come pull
I also want to collaborate we like color
pop and make Marion shades and stuff and
there's just like a few other lines that
I would just love to like collaborate
with and make my own shade out of their
range or my own product I don't know
that would be amazing though what TV
series would you recommend for teens oh
my god I have the best list right now
100% you guys have to watch orphan black
I got to the last season right now like
of last few episodes it's so freaking
good
orphan black is amazing go watch it I
watch on Netflix poured the next one is
revenge I just finished watching the
like four seasons or something of
revenge dead set like oh that show is so
good sorry about that my camera just
died I swear it spends more time being
dead than actually working
but yeah revenge is basically about this
girl that one's revenge revenge back on
something that the family that she's
getting revenge back on did you heard
dad oh it's literally so interesting and
just like things happen in every episode
like you know when you watch like
creative lads humming and everything's
just so drag
and you have to wait so long to figure
things out by in revenge and orphan
black things happen all the time so it
never gets boring but I do like pretty
little eyes as well that's a good show
the next one is if you could kill
someone without anyone noticing would
you I would never kill someone like I
don't even have one little piece of
hatred in my bones for one person ever I
don't think I've ever hated anyone like
no one's ever really done anything to me
that's made me so angry that I like hate
them like they that would I feel like is
really really strong um even what's from
revenge like when someone gets killed in
every episode I would never be like all
that looks fun like what the hell man
what is your nickname for johner guys I
actually do not have a nickname for him
and I cannot think of anything his full
name is Jonathan people call him genre
or John or Johnny I don't want to call
him any of those names because they're
all like friend names like what can I
call him Jay hey Jay
no that's what a friend named as well if
you guys have any ideas let me know in
the comments because I hate saying hey
Jonathan it's like I miss coach or
something we're just seeing you and
Joyner have done I feel like all my
question answers like people asked about
him a hundred times but um weirdest
things we've done we do a lot of weird
things I mean like I pee in front of
MVPs in front of me that's not really
weird though that's normal oh oh my god
guys I do my first fight in front of
Jonathan the other day like if you know
me you know that I fought a lot I don't
know why it's just my body Chloe this is
just as bad I'm just saying that because
so you don't think I'm gross you think
we're both gross so yeah I did my first
fart and he didn't even do anything he
was just like huh and now just fight all
the time I'm just like Yolo so that's
just my interesting story for you for
the day are you gonna get a dog and what
are you gonna call it yes I'm getting a
dog I'm gonna get a dog probably like
tomorrow something I am so excited oh my
god I cannot wait so I will post on
snapchat and I want you guys to help me
with names because I have no idea what
I'm gonna call my dog I don't even know
what does I'm getting it but I'm
thinking of being like a Maltese or a
poodle or something like that like
something just really small because my
house only
except for dogs which is fun because
that's what I wanted anyway a little
story for you all the other day I went
into a pet store and I took a photo and
I just like said that these dogs are
cute and that I wanted one and I was
getting so much hate on tablet saying
that I excuse me saying that I support
pet cruelty um no I do not do not
support pet cruelty a lot of people were
telling me that you know they're raised
on pet farms and stuff and when I went
in there I felt so bad because though in
those little freakin cages and they
can't run and they cause anything I
honestly felt horrible and I just wanted
to buy one so it could get out of that
cage but I guess some people see that as
animal cruelty so I don't know I'm gonna
go look at the pound and see if I can
adopt a little puppy um and just you
know have a look around before I go back
to a pet store because I feel really bad
but I really want to get out of that
cage uh uh I don't know it's confusing
okay and the last question is when does
the music video come out that I was in
if you guys don't know I went to Sydney
a few weeks ago to be a part of the
music video from the band little C and I
was the main lady in the music video and
I was so scared and my anxiety was like
up here and I didn't speak because I was
that nervous but always there was act
well kind of actor stand there I guess
but yeah that music video is out I will
link it down below if you guys want to
check it out this song is so good as
well I literally catch myself see it all
the time so I yeah was so scared to do
that but I pulled through and I just did
it because I feel like all the
opportunities that I get I turned down
because I'm too scared but you just
can't really grow when you stay in your
confort zone so I did it I'm very proud
of myself so I will link it down below
for you guys yeah that is everything for
this question answer your I hope you
guys liked it every video from now on is
going to be at my new house so get very
excited because I'm excited and I hope
