how non-existent they are what can you
do yeah we're about to go have some
lunch and then go to the appointment
okay so I mean Michael are on our way to
the appointment now really no that's
like it's not I get really nervous the
surgery
do you like but to sleep Michael
Warfield adding it
he's Natalie before it just leap it's
just scary being that in there alone
knowing that they're gonna cut my boots
am I going machen giving birth like how
fucking scared you'd be because it's
actually painful
where are we that's go ahead and you
just will not stop laughing it
everything you know I'm getting it
do you want to have a glass of lazy bait
on it no you're not smarter you sure you
can
it's really really put a little home
toys in when I did that it's like a
piece of paper three sides a piece of
paper okay sorry
I'm trying on the sizes right now this
one's a 395 that is way too big hey like
literally fucking massive yeah and this
one's a three I like well that's that
375 375 that's quite big as well but
actually like that a lot
wait you could do the 375 that'd be sick
I just remember how the mini lose 10%
yeah you lose 10% of the actual one
story pal right now I just got one
myself I really like this one but I
don't wanna go to get into 350 everyone
said the dark creepy girl you said 300
before we go he was like we gotta say
300 okay that's like I don't want him up
that high did you guys
you get into small then it's like you're
gonna be able to see the implant cuz
it's not gonna feel like your natural
breast pump yeah exactly so I can't go
300 because they weren't til it out
because around a group I with them sorry
this is how you choose your breast size
you just actually feels really I know
that's so good aren't they 375 400 and
then he's gonna bring along at 320 and
350 because I said I wanted under 350
but it all depends on how well my boob
black if my boob fills up with the size
set that's in sorry he's gonna take four
different sizes and see what kind of
like feels it the best but I'm not going
back very far like this is like hybrid
Polynesia yeah that is because it sticks
out to refine it seeks out this way and
what did you say that the other one yeah
yeah this one sticks out too much and
this one's more like width and just like
something like that yeah cleavage yeah

he kind of loving him lately posture
hi so sorry we left the hospital like
pretty light like six really yeah oh and
now it's four in the morning as soon as
I got home I had to go to sleep cuz I
felt really sick and I was started tired
I could holiday my eyes are good and I
just weren't caught feeling really sick
and my pillows little sleep back so I
had to stand out for the toilet and
Michael fix my pillows his dad just
leave him a sixty degree angle and
honestly I when I jump off the balcony
because it's fucking hats are bad every
time I breathe it feels like I'm getting
stabbed in the huh I guess all my dreams
I had it's literally my not like I don't
know what's going on
it's probably just totnes for my boobs
stretching my skin but I had to take
tiny breasts to not be in a lot of pain
so I'm just seeing some strawberries and
some snakes because I can eat my
it's called Guzman's Mexican because I
had a bot and I was like a little gonna
vomit so now I'm just like chilling here
like stiff bitch and
kill him
my thoughts will turn after me just got
all my tablets out I've had my second
lot of painkillers and I had extra
strong painkillers this time I was gonna
fucking it off out the whole thing yeah
I do this thing all right well I guess
I'm just gonna sit here for like an hour
until I can get back to sleep
who is body slammed the ground oh my god
okay sorry what's the time 8:20 it's
8:20 in the morning this is my babies
um I'm trying to like energy but I
really con at this point um well the
anesthetic that I had liked to put me to
sleep has made me feel really sick so
I'm trying to drink as much water as I
can but so basically what happened was I
got a 375 I think I told you guys that
because the 350 would didn't fill out my
group probably and it looked like fake
you can see the implant um so what
happened was we went to the hospital we
saw a few doctors to confirm all of my
details I got changed then I went into
this room pre-op room laid in bed with
Michael well Michael is next to me and
then they took me to another room after
to draw out all the lines like on my
boobs to see like I don't even know why
but you know mock my body and then I sat
there for like like an hour
I think waiting for my Pangolin he came
to life by the time my surgeon come in
to get me I was literally like sleeping
on my peeler in that room I was already
so tired and so I walk into the room to
have the surgery and I remember is like
the screen had a massive photo of my
tits on it and I just was like well this
is fucking awkward my seats are on the
screen and I was like it's like five
stars in there but yes I thought I took
off my dressing-gown and I had it on the
wrong way so I just switched it around
but then I was like well I don't care if
anyone sees my boobs anyway because
you're about to up write on them for
like two hours or whatever
but yeah I laid down and then literally
I just remember feeling like so relaxed
because that was like really chilled
music and then the doctor that was like
what the nsa's yeah in my Tom he do just
put like alcohol on my arm to get rid of
any gems and then he goes okay you're
gonna feel really tied in a second and
then needle goes in and I'm like oh I've
had so many of those needles before so
I'm used to it but yeah he did that and
I literally just remember just being
like like three seconds off tape with an
eagle and I passed the fuck out so ha
like wow and then I remember just like
waking up and being like wow that was so
easy and I just looked down and I had
three it was no like wow where did they
come from
wow I'm still added on I slightly
so then we came home I felt sorry
fucking sick like walking down to that
rubra I was dreading it because I feel
sorry sick every time I breathe like my
heart would hurt like my chest but it's
like a little stretchy and stuff but we
giggled it and it's so normal to have
chest pains like when my hot it around
my hot area and also I went under the
muscles or my scars like right onto my
boob jun-hyung and I don't her I think
that's what my bras sitting right now so
it kind of like is a little bit painful
but I think the worst thing is that I
just feel sick from the getting would
just sleep but overall it was a pretty
good experience everyone was so nice at
the hospital it's just right now I'm
just like
Oh anything else I need to tell them oh
yeah we forgot to get painkillers
geez I woke up at 8 o'clock after like
coming back from surgery and I was like
hey Mike home to thinking about any
painkillers and he's like oh my fucking
god
he literally sprinted to the chemist and
got all my painkillers and then I I
don't know but I have like eight tablets
every like fucking few hours it's hectic
but yeah that's pretty much all I woke
up at 4:00 a.m. as you saw and was
eating strawberries and snakes cuz I
didn't eat mine non-choice
our grace is here so I'm gonna get that
right now okay we ordered on my side
brothers or I'm really excited because I
feel like something nice and cold Oscar
2 1 1 1
yeah that's pretty much old for this
world I guess um every time I like cuz I
have to sleep on a 60 degree angle so
I'm pretty much sleeping sitting out
every time I lay back and like relax I
don't feel any pain I feel really good I
just have to take a breath because it
hurts when I breathe because the Browns
like sorry tight but I'm just so happy
we have ivory look I saw them yesterday
from like a damn woods angle and they
looked really good like that was Mary
Saget Elise I don't know
