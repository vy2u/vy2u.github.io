my channel so in today's video I'm
finally talking about my porcelain
veneers my new smile I'm so excited so I
really hope you guys find this video
interesting or helpful in any way shape
or form because I know it is such a big
step to get porcelain veneers because at
the end of the day it is a permanent
change so I'm going to talk you through
my experience and how everything went
with me let's do it so if you guys that
don't know what porcelain veneers are
pretty much custom made shells to fit
your teeth and they're pretty much stuck
on top and your real teeth are grinded
back so this is a permanent like
solution so I think the main message in
this video is when you are getting your
teeth done or if you are considering it
it is really important to make sure
you're going to someone that knows what
they're doing has a lot of experience
and can do them to make them look as
natural as possible because they
definitely can look super natural I
think my teeth look real they just look
perfect and I never thought I would say
that so I went to a dentist named dr.
Lazarus he is honestly amazing he's
based in Sydney and there are people
that have flown from all over the world
to see dr. Lazarus that's how you know a
dentist is good my experience with him
was absolutely amazing and I couldn't
recommend him enough to you guys I would
only recommend the best of the best and
he is the best so let's rewind back to
about three years ago when I was 16 when
I went in for the consultation for my
teeth so I thought that my teeth were
completely healthy I've been to dentist
locally obviously my whole life and
everyone said my teeth were fine they
were healthy so when I walked in there I
was just like I just want to get my gas
fixed I just want to straight a smile
and that's all I thought of it and my
dentist was so shocked at how bad I was
grinding my teeth they were starting to
become really paper-thin and the enamel
was like pretty much gone on my teeth
and they were just extremely unhealthy
and I feel like if I hadn't gone through
this whole process of getting cool
souvenirs I wouldn't have teeth in my
head by the tiles like thirty because
that's how unhealthy they were so I was
really shocked to hear that because
obviously I was just going in there to
get like a pretty a smile but really
there was so much more to that it was so
so damaged and I'm like sixteen and
they're really that bad so
huh I was really scary a few of you guys
might know I did get composite veneers
about two years ago before I got my
porcelain veneers there was a few really
important reasons why we had to change
it so the first one being the composite
veneers are a lot weaker than porcelain
because I grind my teeth so bad they
just weren't suitable for my teeth but
the reason we did the composite veneers
straight away was because I was 16 at
the time and your teeth and your draw
everything in here is still moving
around until about like eighteen or
twenty-one so we did need to just wait
and we're kind of just having like a
test run to see what they would look
like and how they would feel my mouth
and yeah it was just too early for such
a big change in my life so this is where
the fun stuff started it was time to get
my porcelain veneers so I went in got my
converse veneers taken off and I got
some temporaries put on so what the
temporaries are it's what you have on
your teeth for about two weeks before
you get your poor something is because
your porcelain veneers have to be sent
overseas or sent wherever they have to
be to be made so that took two weeks and
then I went in to get them done and the
temporary teeth that were put on we're a
pain in my butt and they're a pain
everyone start because the material is
super soft because obviously they're
only temporary and you want them to be
easy to take off that's why the material
is super weak so I couldn't eat any hard
food or anything for two weeks which was
really hard really hard but it was all
worth it so we went to wait for my full
service so I went in and I guess took oh
did it take about four or three hours
and Jonathan was there the whole time
with me
I got needles to numb my whole mouth so
I didn't feel anything at all the
process was just really smooth I was
just laying there watching TV the whole
time I had happy gas it was just a
really fun time so yeah four hours I
passed and it was time to look at my
teeth and I honestly couldn't feel
anything in this area so when it was
like time for the big reveal
I I was trying to smile it was quite
hard but honestly I was so incredibly
shocked I was so happy I don't know I
had no words because I never thought
that my teeth will look this good I
never thought I'd be this confident with
my teeth and to be honest having a smile
that you're confident about makes such a
huge difference in your confidence I am
so much more confident with my smile I'm
always smiling
think smiling is so important because
smiling is beautiful and it's contagious
and it's a sign of happiness and I just
think everyone should be confident with
their smile with my converse of veneers
I had my front 6 done and then when we
were moving on to my porcelain we
started to do my front 10 because I do
have a really wide smile so it does
depend on your smile and your mouth
shape and your jaw shape and everything
when it comes to like how many teeth
you're getting done or whatever that is
I don't really know that whole process
but with my teeth it was 10 because my
smiles for big I didn't get my bottom
teeth done because they're pretty
straight and you can't really see them
when I smile I guess until I get old
with my whole basket Paulsen veneers
usually lasts about seven to twenty
years according to Google but I'm gonna
ask dr. Lazarus about that one I know
they do last a very long time there I'm
just going to keep going for check-ups
every now and then so I wear my mouth
guard to bed to protect them it's like a
really thin comfortable mouth guard at
popping in wake up
take it out teeth look perfect still so
yeah I hope you guys like this video and
hopefully you found it helpful and make
sure you do take your research really
seriously with who you are going to
because it is a permanent change
you can't go back once you get porcelain
veneers because your teeth get grown up
down so I hope this video helped you out
I can put my notes away now I will see
you in my next video bye
Aven bound and thinking bow
