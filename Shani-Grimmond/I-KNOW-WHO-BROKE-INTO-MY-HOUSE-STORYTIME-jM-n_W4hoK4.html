my channel so in today's video I'm gonna
go into detail about the break-in that
happened about five months ago for you
guys that don't know I made a video five
months ago saying my house got broken
into and stuff but I didn't go into any
detail because it was still kind of
under investigation and I wasn't quite
sure if I wanted to tell you guys
details and stuff but now I am more than
ready I'm completely over everything
that happened and I'm just ready to
share everything that happened behind
the scenes with you guys there is so
much juicy gossip that you guys are
going to want to hear so pretty much how
it happened and what I said in my last
video is they broke through the back
window they just smashed it open climbed
in and then they pretty much took
everything so they left furniture and
some of my clothes but they took all
Jonathan's all my makeup all my camera
equipment and pretty much just let us
live dust furniture so that's that
that's what I said but now it's time for
the interesting stuff so about three
days after the break-in happened I was
like I cannot stay here anymore I want
to move to mom so I mean Jonathan packed
up all of our stuff we move everything
to mum's house so the three days I was
sleeping there I was so scared when I'd
go for a shower and I'd like wash my
hair to close I close my eyes I would
just be like like making sure no one's
there I was so terrified because well
they could come back and my dad my mom
my like boyfriend they're like I'm not
going to come back while they come back
when they've already taken everything
that they wanted and I was like I don't
know they probably could come back and
they know we live they've got our keys
they could come back so that's why I was
so scared so we go out of there three
days later and I pretty much took
everything except like a TV cabinet and
a computer chair so I left out there so
at this point in time I was still a
little bit shaken up about the whole
thing I still felt very violated and
very scared and I was very like aware
all the time and I was just doing some
grocery shopping and when I came out I
sat in the car I was just checking my
Instagram and I come across this message
from this random girl and she said I
have something to tell you and I think
you deserve to know but I really don't
want the people that broke into your
house to find out that I told you and I
was like frantically replying like oh my
god please tell me like I need to know I
don't know anything like I don't know
who did it I have no idea all I know is
that my stuffs gone
so I was just sitting in the car park
for about 20 minutes waiting for her to
reply and she finally did and I called
mom straightaway and I was like mom this
is we broke into our house like I know
who did it this is crazy and I called
dad and the moms like okay let's go to
the police station and then dad was more
like how do you know it was them and I
was like someone messaged me and he's
like but how do you know like it's true
so we eventually went to the police
station and we told them when we showed
them the message and they're pretty much
just like oh okay
and they didn't really do anything at
all they gave us another police
officer's number to call and tell them
because they were like handling the case
and she was on holiday so she couldn't
help us out at all so pretty much they
didn't really give a so after that
I was like okay yeah I understand this
message isn't enough to prove that these
are the people that broke into the house
so I kind of let it go a little bit and
then a few days later I literally
started getting message up the message
of a list of the same people's name in
my inbox saying this is the person that
broke into your house have been going
around to like underage house parties
being like I still just shutting Kevin's
makeup I break into our house like fully
bragging about it going to work and
bragging about it so you've got they've
got my jewelry and all of that stuff so
I was like okay this is definitely a
hundred cent these are the people that
did it I guess the question that
everyone has been asking is who are they
who work into your house well I'm
obviously not going to give them any
more attention than what they've already
got because the amount of times they've
gone out of their way to brag about it
they've got enough attention so a bit
about them they're about 16 to 17
year-olds there was about eight of them
half of them are guys half of my girls I
know every single one of their names I
know exactly who did it so I feel like
this will describe what type of girls
and guys they were so for the girls I
had a lot of nice clothes little classy
clothes a lot of heels and then on the
other side I had all of my workout
clothes my night shoes they only took my
workout clothes and then for Jonathan he
had all of his Polar's his Ralph Lorenz
he's Tommy Hilfiger's all of his
designer clothes they took all of them
and his Nike shoes but left all of his
like dress shoes and all of his like
suits and stuff you get those people and
those ones so this was the time where I
was ready to start stalking the
saluté out of these people and get
evidence of them actually wearing my
clothes wearing Jonathan's clothes and
we go straight into their profiles and
what do you see she's at least half my
size and she's wrong a size 10 shoe I
was like that is definitely my shoe
because it looks like a clown foot on
her and then the guy that the main guy
that kind of broke in um he was running
Johnson's clothes I would say at least
four things he was wearing okay this is
kind of like the biggest giveaway but on
one of his social medias he wrote I
robbed you is he trying to like rub it
in or something so like okay cool we
have evidence of them wearing our stuff
we went to the police we gave him names
and everything and they already had one
of the guys names so they obviously had
some sort of idea of what happened but
they're pretty much just like we can't
do anything unless they pretty much
confess and I mean even if they did get
caught what are they going to do pay us
two dollars a week of what they earn
there at work they go to school they're
like 16 so I just pretty much gave up on
trying to get them caught they'd already
done everything provided us with enough
evidence to prove that they're guilty
but the police didn't do anything and I
was just like whatever I don't want any
of my stuff back anyway they've
obviously used my makeup or they've
obviously sold pretty much everything
else so a week goes by I am kind of
dropping things I'm getting used to the
fact that the house being broken into
cool I got to buy more stuff I've got to
just replace everything like that's fine
it's just the fact that I had to get
over the violation feeling and that's
kind of what I was overcoming at that
time so I'm going to the old house to
pick up the computer chair that I left
there and a few other things and what do
I see there's a letter from the police
on my door saying your door was left
wide open this street had been broken
into on the 21st excuse me I was by
myself and you're telling me they broke
into my house again the only person that
could have broke into the house again
was them because they had stolen all of
my keys they'd stolen the front door key
my car key the back door key and the
front door was open
I mean after getting broken broken into
obviously I'd be extremely careful with
locking the doors so
obviously I didn't leave it open they've
tried to break into my house again they
didn't want my chair they didn't want my
TV cabinet thanks so much guys
appreciate it I'm just really glad I got
out of there three days after it
happened I mean if I could go back I'd
be gone that night so if you think
that's bad something else happens and it
just keeps getting dragged out and it's
so annoying at this point
because I'm ready for it to just be put
in the past I'm ready for it to be done
I'm starting to buy my new MAC lipsticks
that they stole I'm dying to buy my
cameras and lenses and everything like
I'm getting over it like whatever just
 off
so we upload the video of me explaining
about the break-in because everyone was
like you're the last you cheater you
haven't uploaded in two months so I
thought I would upload a video and
explain what had happened so people
would understand because obviously if I
just left people hanging it just
wouldn't I don't know I just love
sharing things with you guys and I love
being open and honest obviously like I
am right now so I upload this video and
then ding I get a message on my facebook
and it's the bitch that was involved
with the whole breaking in with my house
she decides to message me and she says
love your new video without emoji hope
you look after your makeup a bit better
next time splint your face emoji if you
want to drag me into it beep the person
that the main person that did it is
going to be more than happy to continue
the drama
excuse me is she literally threatening
me that she's going to like break into
my house again she literally just dogged
that person in and said that he's the
one that did it
and I've got it in writing and then she
says I wasn't involved I didn't even
know what happened until I saw that
video uploaded I sure you have the right
person I didn't get her involved in the
video I didn't name any names so she's
basically bringing herself into the
situation and dubbing herself in and the
girl that was messaging me this stuff
was the girl that had about 90% of my
makeup and you guys know how much makeup
I have like I am obsessed with makeup
and I mean it makes sense that she had
90% of it because she studies makeup she
would probably love it just as much as I
would and I hope she enjoys all about
secondhand stuff
so months and months go by I start
buying all the stuff that I have back I
pretty much have everything back I've
got a new place that is so secure and I
feel so safe and I'm saying to get happy
again I'm starting to forget about
everything that had happened and I don't
feel affected at all and I'm just like
happy happier than I've ever been and
then she messages me again and I haven't
replied to our last three messages what
makes her think I'm in her planner this
one not sure but I have it right here
she says why don't you get a real job
and stop bumming at home and making
YouTube videos like it's an actual job
and then she says why don't you go and
actually do a makeup course and that I'm
not smart enough and that it's really
really hard and it's harder than it
looks
I mean what what why the does she
keep messaging me obviously she's
watching my YouTube videos I mean not to
toot my own horn thing but I am
happy I'm pretty successful for a 19
year old I'm happy with what I do I
graduated school unlike her I mean I'm
doing well
so I blocked her because I'm sick of
getting these petty little messages that
I don't care about I don't care about
her I don't care about what she does I
mean you have a nice day with your
makeup course I'm not interested in
doing other people's makeup so I'm not
going to do that I'm happy doing what
I'm doing I have a passion for what I'm
doing and at the end of the day it's
what I want to do so I blocked her of
Facebook and Instagram and I noticed
that she was following me on Instagram
because one of her following side went
down so thanks for the follow but bye
see ya and then I had two other
encounters with two guys that were
involved and so I pull over to the side
of the road and I see someone just
walking and I just happened to look over
there and it's the guy that did it it's
like the main guy that broke into the
house the guy that has my keys that has
pretty much everything that I own um
although it's probably sold by now and
he just looks me in the eye like this
like he's not sorry he doesn't
care about what is what he's done and I
was like
hmmm interesting I was just really like
shocked I was like where is like his
humanity I don't understand people like
that so obviously I didn't say anything
because I'm not really interested in
getting beaten up or something like that
and then the second time I had an
encounter with one of the guy that broke
into my house
his older brother so I went up to him at
a music festival and I was like your
brother broke into my house both really
really drunk by the way and then he's
like no I didn't it was this person this
person and he basically named everyone
else that was involved and I was like no
your brother did it and then my friends
like can you at least get a
camera back and he's like yeah yeah I
can get a camera back in a TV and I'm
thinking okay you just basically dug
your own brother in and everyone else
that did it like confirming it once
again reliving the moment once again
these people just like everywhere I went
so I kept like thinking about it was
really annoying but um we we just walked
off and whatever never spoke of that
again
I still see Matt like sometimes and I'm
just like hello nice to see you it's
such a small world
I think the funniest thing was like the
people that broke into our house their
friends like they're really good friends
were messaging us telling us that they
had this planned all along and just
telling us all their plans and stuff and
what they did that they drove our car
with like all the stuff to another house
and dumped it there and just kept doing
like loads in the car and I did notice
that because my car seat was moved back
and I was assuming that was the guy that
was driving my car because the girls
wouldn't have had their license honor
the guy wouldn't have either my god
lucky then he crashed my car yeah I
noticed the seat was pulled back so
obviously someone that was driving had
long legs you know what I am so glad
that they broke into my house because if
they didn't I would still be living in
that same place I would still be living
in that suburb I would still be I mean I
wasn't unhappy but I wasn't as happy as
I am here like this place is amazing I
love Bristol smokes pot I love fritzman
so much the people that I've met here
are amazing I've made the most amazing
bunch of friends I mean I'm happy that
they did that
I mean I've learnt a lot and I've grown
up a lot from that and it made me mature
a lot and I don't know I never thought
I'd be like glad of like happy that
would have happened
I mean I would never wish something bad
upon anyone and I hope they all can
become better people and look at
themselves and realize well I up
so many times and I mean they're not the
best people but I think that they can
turn their life around as well and
hopefully if they watch this they
realize like what are you doing with
your life
I mean don't know it sometimes it's just
you've got to look at yourself and
realize it's time to grow up and I mean
I stalk their pages sometimes sometimes
I want to see like what they're doing if
they if they're becoming better people
or if they're still doing what they're
doing and I still see those depressing
statuses I still see them being quite
unhappy and I don't know I just hope
that they change also I want to thank
you guys for like sticking around for
that whole journey you guys honestly
helped me out so much I was feeling so
violated and so scared and now I'm
happier than ever and you guys have
honestly helped me with that so much and
I love you guys so I don't know I just
feel like the more that I upload the
more support I get and I've been
uploading quite a lot lately so I've
been getting a lot of support and it's
just so amazing I've got my period I'm
really emotional do you love that but
like oh I'm really happy guys I kinda
started happy and yeah I'm gonna go now
