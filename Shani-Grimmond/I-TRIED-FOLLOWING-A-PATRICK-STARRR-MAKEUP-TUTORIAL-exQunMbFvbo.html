channel so in today's video I'm gonna be
following at Patrick stars that makeup
tutorial I'm super excited to do this
video because everyone obviously does
that makeup so differently and I just
want to give it a go and see how he does
whose makeup I have watched a few of his
makeup tutorials before sir he's amazing
at makeup let's see if we can recreate
it as good as him so I have a video up
right here called America's Next Top
Model makeup tutorial and I'm just gonna
put everything on the screen so you can
see it I'm gonna sit right here so you
guys can watch the video here so let's
go ahead and start I'm excited let's do
this this is my bad side yeah wanna be
on top or are you so now that my skin is
fresh I'm going to prime the skin I
tried this new spray here this is my h2o
Beauty the Oasis quench the day
hydration this is what I don't have that
but instead I'm just gonna use like what
I do have sir I want to take the Urban
Decay vitamin in future a vitamin in the
future my god I cannot speak today
vitamin infused complexion prep priming
spray so I'm just gonna spritz this all
over my face wait I'm gonna see if
that's we goes I'm obsessed with oh wow
spray in the face you or do you see this
you can see the mist up to this camera
okay HD come on 2018 can we get a
slow-mo Oh
oh my god love it I'm also gonna put
some mac fix+ on my face as well
wow I'm it's so wet now okay wow that
came out so wrong
Brow's we want full we want 90s we want
supermodel brows I'm gonna go ahead and
sorry he's using the benefits brow
pencil I think that one before I moved
on I want to show you guys a trick
because I got my brows done and I kind
of want to make them more straight
because this one is a little bit too
arched for me it's all just but I have
the complete opposite problem my
eyebrows are too straight if you guys
want to get a more full brow it doesn't
have to be just the top or make the art
because otherwise if you pull the arch
too much on the top it'll just look like
that whereas we can dictate the shape
and make it lower and more fierce for
that edgy you know fierce brow this kind
of gives you that like a supermodel
frown you know oh my gosh I never use
eyebrow pencils this is really weird for
me so I'm just gonna try my best to draw
underneath the eyebrow to make it a
little bit more straight like he said oh
my gosh this is we I'm literally praying
that he cleans up under the brows
otherwise I'm screwed
doesn't the brows I'm a little scary but
we're gonna blend a little bit okay Wow
he'd definitely fill in the top of his
brows as well the next step is to go in
with the concealer I'm just gonna do
exactly what he did at Whitney's brows
just like called the absolute laughs out
of the top and the bottom of my mouth
this pot is gonna be my absolute Savior
with this shape of them
by the way I'm not entirely sure who
made up this challenge but I will leave
that link down below for the face I'm
gonna take a little bit of benefit
professional and a benefit professional
yes I have this one right here I don't
think I've used this cheap actually I
think it's a new one
cuz I don't really have big pores so I
don't usually use it but we have copying
everything and yes I'm missing it now I
always miss you now this morning and I
just got it fixed I'm just gonna rub
this all over girl Wow my brows is just
like chillin let's see what's next I'm
gonna take a brand new foundation this
one is called the NARS a natural radiant
long where I have that one Shin I heard
lots of good things the first time
trying it this yes let's get it I
literally have all of the shades yeah so
I'm just gonna go ahead and pick out my
color
oh god okay so let's see how we blend it
out the HU aah oh and Joaquin me next
for the under eyes oh my that was quick
all right let's let's do this my
favorite part about watching makeup
tutorials is watching people blend in
that foundation it's so crazy to see the
power of editing like because I know how
long it actually takes to your makeup
and to edit all of this stuff and then
just to see it whipped up in a video
it's just so cool lets blend this in
this foundation is sorry beautiful boy I
like this color as well you know I just
realized oh my goodness I'm gonna have
to do my eyes off to my foundation I've
literally never done that in my life I
always do my eyes first because they
always get full out Oh foundation is
blending of concealers for the face
first I have been loving the YSL Touche
claw I don't have that concealed out so
I'm gonna go meet the color pop an airy
feel to concealer and I'm just gonna do
what
and it's so easy in its a pet you see
the secret to Apache stock pages that
we're gonna draw a lot of like towards
the middle so under the eyes on the nose
and contour all around so if you guys
want attention to your face just do that
with all the could feel okay I'm just
gonna go with a lot of shade then if
that's the case all right now I'm going
to take my Beauty Blender and blend all
this concealer and bounce to buddha
panda all over my face blend it out
what's sorry we're not having my
eyeshadow done all right guys I'm gonna
immediately set with my wedding only
Patrick's powder from Mac cosmetics
we're launching internationally this
month I got this hat off I have never
baked as much as he does so this is
gonna be interesting
so next just gonna take a bunch of
powder and just beat your face like you
in the 90s thank you a 90 supermodel
okay cuz everything back then was Matt I
love top
I don't have a toughie thing I don't
know what that is I don't have it so I'm
just gonna go with my brush slap this on
my face oh my god I feel like I'm not
adding enough oh my god it's going
everywhere
no it's gonna be so dry after this oh my
god that makes my face look so soft I'm
gonna start off and take a little bit of
caramel okay I'm gonna go find a palette
that's similar to that one sir I'm gonna
take the baked Browns pellet buy a dose
of colors this one is very pigmented I'm
gonna take the shade deserted it's this
one right here I feel like that's very
similar to the one that he's using I'm
in and apply this all over the crease
I'm so starved next I'm gonna take a
little girl oh my god he must have
primed his eyes sneaky devil missed that
one actually I'm gonna go with this
color right here instead I feel like
that one's a lot more similar to the one
Patrick's using it's a bit more of like
a pinky train this one's called
outdoorsy these shutters are so
incredibly pigmented so I'm just gonna
try and keep a light hand with this okay
so he blends it in all the way to the
inner corner so I'm
make sure to do that next I'm gonna take
a little bit of hazelnut and mix it with
mocha wait what was my counter by the
search I opened with mocha okay so I'm
gonna mix these two colors together holy
crap this is working sorry well with
this palette and apply this on the inner
and outer crease so I'm gonna leave the
middle of my eye free which is gonna be
really difficult because I basically
have no I shape
I met inner space because my eyes are a
little
Orpheum 4-3-3 this is a must-have brush
you guys wanna come I go that's amazing
is the lit a dictate plus silver I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply this to
the center oh my god that is incredible
so what I'm gonna do is go in with the
in glutes pure pigment eyeshadow in the
shade or one two four this is incredible
and then underneath that I'm gonna take
a glitter glue this one's from violet
Voss so I'm just gonna pop this in the
center of my lid you did bring it up
really high as well I have hooded eyes
this is gonna look so different on me
this is the pot I'm nervous about when
it comes to full-out do that oh wait he
still owes Bank under his eyes sure he
does so for this look I have been loving
this Stila stay all day waterproof
liquid eyeliner in dark brown I just
love a good we did that one cuz it was
bleeding on me sorry I'm gonna go in
with my Miller cosmetics liquid liner
now for the bottom of the waterline I'm
gonna go ahead and take this beautiful
Mac pencil it's such a pretty color oh I
have this one that might work this one's
from Urban Decay looks like that it's
very a little bit true Orange
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
black or the top so it kind of makes the
same shade as his and I'm gonna take the
newest bad gal bang mascara but yes I
have that one that's so funny cuz um he
still has his bike on so I'm just gonna
leave mine on can I just say I feel so
much better double stacking my lashes
because something was awesome
well as soon as I smoked it out
something was off so I took just some
random pure lash line as well and double
stack whose lashes so where do that so
I'm gonna dust off of the fallout ah
swing so fast okay
dusting off the fallout please come off
my skin bit of a white past but that's
alright
I make up forevers Pro finish powder its
foundation powder where that my more of
the e51 brush love this brush go ahead
and add some color back into my face
much product on my face right now I feel
weird putting more on
oh now for the under I'm gonna take to
make up for ever pro finish again in a
lighter color and the ones when he ain't
brush I'm just gonna go in with the Kat
Von D shade + light contouring palette
and I'm gonna pick up this one may be a
mixture between these two here I'm just
gonna pack this a bunch of my eyes like
he is this is scary I need to go in with
my astrologer sham fullest because like
all the concealers coming off I feel
like all this baking is like lifting all
of my concealer I don't know how he does
it it looks incredible
alright I'm gonna take this color deep
dark it's a mineralized skinfinish I
love this powder let's go I didn't
Barone's the face I'm just gonna put
heaps of this on cuz my face is like way
too yellow right now
the Bruns that I'm gonna take is from
Galan it's in the shade Terra Cotta this
is like the most similar shade that I
have to what he was using but we do have
completely different skin turns anyway
sir for me what he's using take my
favorite blush ever this is called
peaches by Mac oh I think I have that
one as well okay I love a blush blush
seems to be over everyone away their
last but not least we are to lips this
is the combo that I was inspired by at
least what about hiwatt oh he doesn't
put highlight on I'm gonna cry we are to
lips this is the combo that I was
inspired by make up an Ariel and Shay
Mitchell on her channel I'm gonna go in
with a mellow lip pencil in the shade ha
ha and I'm gonna draw my lips a lot oh
my god out in your house is gonna hook
on me I'm kind of scared for this pot
holy crap this is actually impossible to
find a color like that not to do I'm
just gonna put some gloves on over the
top okay so here we have the finished
look the only thing that I'm thinking is
my lips look ridiculous
it looks like I've got at least 20 mils
in that like they need to know I don't
like the gloss on there I really like
how the makeup turned out I love the
hailer eye I kind of want to do this for
my 21st it's coming up really soon it's
like in three weeks of thumbing yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this type

little bit different and Patrick Starr
