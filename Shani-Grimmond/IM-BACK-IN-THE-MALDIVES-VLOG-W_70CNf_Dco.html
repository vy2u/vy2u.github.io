guys enjoyed today's vlog I had the best
day I noticed when I was editing like
the start was like a little bit all over
the place because I put in like me
coming here and everything but I just I
don't really like vlogging but I'm
actually like on the plane and
everything because like I mean it's
boring so I didn't want to show you guys
that but yeah it definitely is a hike
and a half to get here it is so worth it
as I said before thank you so much for
supporting me and letting me be able to
do these kind of trips because they're
honestly like the highlight of my last I
think a lot of traveling so much and
meeting new people new influences like
everyone like it's incredible and I feel
like you guys looking at my lips are you
looking at me like this because like
the ground that's paying that's
definitely a problem oh and by the way I
got a haircut before I came here it is
what sure and I also got like bangs in
the front but my bangs are just like a
little little bit of Fringe yeah I
really miss uploading like my makeup
videos as well because I've been like
traveling a lot so I haven't been able
to upload like my normal videos so let
me know what videos you guys want to see
in the comments below so when I do get
home I can just absolutely smash it out
but I am gonna vlog tomorrow as well so
that'll be incredible the whole point of
me actually coming on this trip is
because benefit is launching a new
makeup product no one knows what it is
yet so I'm super excited it's just one
way for a brand to get like a product
super hyped up and like bring heaps of
influences to like post about and stuff
so I was lucky enough to be one of the
influences on this trip which is so cool
like I'm so honored anyways I love you
guys so much and I'll see you in my next
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
