me on my trip to Tasmania so I thought
it'd be fun to just do a bit of a vlog
with a voiceover just something
different so waking up extremely early
which is literally the last thing that I
ever want to do because I'm not a
morning person driving straight to
Brisbane Airport thanks bag and then
going straight to Tasmania I've actually
never been to Tasmania before it was
really beautiful and the whole morning
just consisted of travel travel travel
travel and then it was time to go over
to Bruny Island which is a little island
off Tasmania so it's like 30 minutes on
a ferry and I guess I should tell you
why I'm in Tasmania I am in little seas
new music video that is coming out very
soon and I'm so incredibly excited I
seriously can't wait to see it and I
can't wait for you guys to see it so
then we basically just waited for
everyone to arrive and we just started
shooting straight away so obviously I've
never had any kind of experience with
acting or doing anything remotely close
to this so it was really amazing to have
Matt there to kind of just like make me
feel comfortable and guide me through
everything that I had to do so that was
incredible and as you can see the place
that we were shooting at was so so
beautiful it's kind of like a bohemian
vibe and I just felt really relaxed and
just really calm so yeah I was wearing
this tiny little jumpsuit and it was
freezing I believe it was like seven
degrees and I was outside a lot of the
time so there is a little bit of a
important message that I want to share
with you guys in this video so basically
I was super close to the cloning the
offer of being in this music video
because I was so nervous and I do get
really bad anxiety when I'm put in kind
of like uncomfortable or unfamiliar
situations just because I'm quite shy
and
I know that's just how I am and
obviously I wanted to do it so so much
but I was that nervous that I was like I
can't do it I'm just gonna like break
down and so what I did was I quit my dad
and he was just like I really think you
should do it just overcome your fear
just dive in headfirst and that's
exactly what I did I'm so proud of
myself because as you can see there's
like people standing around and kind of
like watching you obviously filming you
and stuff so it is a little bit
intimidating but lucky for me I had the
most amazing people surrounding so it
was just incredible and I'm so proud of
myself and I want to push you guys to do
do things like that as well things you
feel uncomfortable with just just do it
girlfriend you can do it in the most
incredible part of everything when you
finish something that you were really
scared to do is just the feeling of
relief once you've done and feeling so
so proud of yourself like it can't get
better than that so after I was all done
shooting I would say about three hours
or so we were just watching the blade
shoot and it was so incredible to watch
because they're just they just throw
talented I can't even believe it they're
so nice and so humble and as you can see
before we were doing their makeup soda
to concealer under the eyes so you know
when I told you that it was freezing in
Tasmania I was being furious I went
ahead and put my pajamas on in the
middle of the blue shooting because I
was freezing and then after everything
was done we headed to a little tavern
near where we're staying and it was so
delicious
I have Scotch Phillips steak fries and
salad and everyone else was enjoying
their meals as well and then after we
had finished we realized that we've lost
the keys to the van so we were stuck
there for company off we and then sadly
it was time to go home
but I did miss the hot weather in
Brisbane so I made friends with a guy on
the plane and had a great chat and yeah
that's pretty much all I have to say I
hope you guys have an amazing day and
I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
