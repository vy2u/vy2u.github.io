hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so today's video is really exciting
because I have one to do this for the
longest time now it's a makeup tutorial
inspired by Iggy Azalea and if you guys
want to see the photo before you start
watching this video then I'll have a
link down below
it is stunning it she is gorgeous so I'm
really excited and let's get started so
I already primed my face with the
benefit Porefessional just to make sure
my foundation that lasts all day and
then I'll be going in with the L'Oreal
true match foundation on a Beauty
Blender and if he does have quite fair
skin but I'm not going to be choosing a
lighter foundation for my face only
because my face will be really light and
my neck will be ten so I'm just gonna be
choosing a foundation that matches my
skin so I'm just going to start blending
this in all over my face and as I said
in like all of my videos I love using
these Beauty blenders I just honestly
though the best things to apply
foundation with oh my god this
foundation actually is for few shades
lighter than my skin but that's alright
that's okay I just put some sticky tape
from the outer portion of my eye all the
way out to the edge of my eyebrow just
serving line is nice and harsh when I
drew my eyeliner and my eyeshadow and
stuff so for the eyeshadow base I'm
going to be using this color tattoo by
Maybelline in the shade bold gold and
it's just going to be a base to make
sure that the pigment is more vibrant so
I'm just going to warm this up with my
finger because it is kind of dry now
because I haven't used in so long
now I'll be taking this matte pigment in
the shade 10 and I was going to be
putting this all over my lid it is the
most stunning color if you guys looking
for a new pigment from Mac that is the
best color in the range in my opinion so
I'm just going to be putting this all
over my lid oh my god look at the color
for just a tiny bit of depth to the eyes
and will be taking my whole benefit
bronzer on a little fluffy brush and
just lightly dusting this in my crease
and then I'll just be taking a little
bit of these same bronzer and then
putting it on my lower lash line just to
make them appear a little bit more full
because I have like no bottom lashes and
then I'll just be taking my Too Faced
natural eye palette and just this white
shade right there just to highlight my
brow bone and I think if you did have a
matte Brown highlight so that's just why
I'm using this color and I think it's
Gorge time for eyeliner I'm going to be
starting off with the Maybelline master
precise eyeliner and just lining my
upper lash line and then I'll be using a
different liner to create the width with
a weak to create the flick
I'm going anywhere disorder right now I
don't even know what's going on so I'm
gonna be using my mascara and this is
the benefit they're real mascara and
this is nearly out but it's one of my
favorite mascaras ever I'll have to eat
another one so I'm just going to be
coating my top and bottom lashes and
I'll be putting some falsies on soon as
well and also with the bottom lashes I'm
not going to put too much mascara on
because Iggy's were quite small so yeah
I always get so carried away when I'm
doing my mascara especially with the
Jordon our best lash extreme it is so
volumizing so yeah I did just say I'm
not putting too much mascara on my
bottom lashes but I got carried away
so Iggy's lashes were quite full so I'm
going in with these Revlon lashes and
these are called beyond natural and then
to make them even more full I'll be
going in with these red cherry lashes
and I'll just be cutting this in half
and putting it on the outer portion of
my eye these lashes are horrible to put
on I find them so hard I don't know why
the band is just really wonky and now
I'm just popping at the other lash on
the outer corner of my eye
and now moving on to eyebrows I'm just
going to be looking at this photo of her
and going for it because her eyebrows
are extremely different shapes of mine
so I'm just going to try and mimic this
as much as I can so I'm just going to be
using the chichi eyebrow pencil and this
is a few shades lighter than my eyebrows
because his eyebrows work quite light so
I'm just going to try and you know work
my way around this okay so to blend
these crazy brows out I'm just going to
be taking a spoolie and brushing through
them and this will just blend all the
wax together just so it's not as harsh
moving on to concealer finally I'm going
to be taking the Physicians Formula
concealer and there is like a yellow
side and then a pink side so I'm going
to be mixing them together just to get
the right color so obviously putting
this under my eyes just to cancel out
the discoloration because her under eyes
will like a perfect does nothing there
so just blending it out with a Beauty
Blender this is the best way to blend
concealer in my opinion I think this is
just like the best thing ever I just I
can't even stop talking about it
okay so to contour my nose I'm taking
the NARS Laguna on a little blending
brush by Coastal Scents and I'm just
going to be putting this down these
sides of my nose to make it appear a bit
slimmer because her nose in the photo
was really contoured so I'm just going
to be doing a light contour today so I'm
just going to be starting from up here
near my eyebrow and then just working my
way down to the tip of my nose in like
small little strokes
and then just down the center of my nose
I'll be taking beaver and all wake me up
concealer and just a tiny bit down there
and then I'll just be blending it in
with my finger so his face was really
matte so I'm just going to be taking
some powder and I'll just be putting
this all over my face
and I just be pressing this in just so I
don't disturb any of that foundation
just to add a little bit of color to the
face I'll be taking the L'Oreal glam
bronze on a powder brush and she didn't
have too much color on her face at all
so I'm just gonna be putting a little
tiny tiny bit under my cheekbones and
also I'll be contouring under my jaw
bone in just a second and to do that
obviously using the NARS Laguna bronzer
on a small contour brush by Sigma and
obviously we're running this under my
jawbone because hers was really really
intense and it just looks stunning in
the photo so that's just what I'm doing
to make it look more distinct so now I'm
just taking the benefit high beam
highlighter because she had a gorgeous
glow in the photo so I'll just be
rubbing this in with my finger and I
just dropped it all over my floor so I
have a lot to use
and then I'll just be taking a tiny bit
down the center of my nose as well so
now I'm going in with the mac mineralize
skinfinish in soft and gentle on my
fingers and I'll just be putting this
exactly where I put that other highlight
just for a more intense highlight so
finally on the last step I'm taking this
a red lipstick in the shade at the tail
and in the photo it look like it was a
bit of an orangey red so I'm just using
a little lip brush just to make sure the
line is nice and crisp to make a lips
more orange I'm going to be taking this
Tootie lipstick in the shade status
because as you can see it is a really
really orange so hopefully these two it
mix together nicely
and to make lips glossy I'll be taking
these two NYX butter glosses in this
shade cherry cheesecake and cherry pie
and obviously you don't have to use all
four of these products that I was using
in this video you can use any red
lipstick or orange lipstick that you
want but I'm just trying to get it as
close as I can as her lips were in the
photo with all the products that I have
so those all for this inspired makeup
look actually a really like how it
turned out I think it looks really nice
and elegant and just really pretty good
so I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you
