my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a first impression and review on the
Kylie Jenner liquid lipsticks I'm pretty
sure I have every single shade here so
I'm also going to be switching these few
and I haven't open these yet it's
honestly been so hard
so I'm bloody excited so let's get
started so my hairdresser told me when
these lip kits were going on sale it
said on her app I'm pretty sure so I
woke up at 6 o'clock like two weeks ago
on a Monday morning which was great it
was just so great waking up that early
and I managed to get all of them really
easily they sold out either wash my hair
everywhere they sold out in about half
an hour so I've got in and like the
first minute and I was like oh cool got
more talented I know so first of all
let's talk about the shipping it came in
about two weeks which i think is really
good considering how many she would have
to ship out well the company would have
to ship out um yeah I think that's
really quickest considering it's coming
all the way from America as well the
packaging is really nice it's just super
sleek and simple which is exactly what I
like and then it has a personal touch in
here it is a photocopied thank-you from
Kylie thing thanks so much for partisan
your Kylie lip kit etc and I love the
logo so cute so these liquid lipsticks
were $30 each which i think is really
good because it comes with a liquid
lipstick and a liner so it's basically
like 15 dollars for each one u.s. as
well so when I converted it to
Australian dollars all of these products
were about $400 I also got oh my god I
just did the Australian tries American
candy and is like the marshmallow stuff
on the lip kit but I did get double ups
of Dolce K and candy K so the dark nude
and the light nude shape so I will be
putting that in a giveaway when I hit
some hundred K I'm just going to collect
everything now so I had it all prepared
for you guys so yeah let's go through
the shades here I have Coco K which is a
lightest nude that I have at Kandy K
which I guess is the in-between nude
then we have a Dolce K which I think
will be my favorite one because I love
true like deep dark kind of nudes and
then we have a Purdy K which is a nice
purpley shade
we have port K which is a dark purple a
very very bold I'm hoping this isn't
patchy because I know that dark shades
can be quite patchy the next one is Mary
Jo K which is a very vibrant red it
almost a tiny bit pink doesn't look very
bad let's compare it so here it is
comparing to my other Reds right here I
definitely can see a tinge of pink and
last but not least we have at 22 which
is kind of like a Reddy orange shade I
think this will be my least favorite
just because it wouldn't really I don't
know it just doesn't look amazing I have
heard really good things about these
products so I'm really excited to try
them out honestly I love them like two
days ago they've been sitting in my room
I'm like come on I need to film it so
I'm finally filming and I'm just so
excited to see what the formula and
stuff is like so the packaging of the
actual liquid lipstick and lip liner is
amazing I mean that is so cute this one
is coke okay I think the packaging is so
sleek and just such good quality so I'm
very happy about that
apparently you can sharpen these lip
liners I don't see what they smell like
oh my god
it smells really strong of vanilla and
I'm like a vanilla cupcake
well that's strong and also the
applicator is quite small so I think
that'll be great full application
alrighty I'm gonna wipe my MAC lipstick
off now this is the shade yeah SHhhh and
then I'm going to starts watching for
you guys I'm so excited first of all I
just want to say sorry about how cracked
my lips are they look disgusting but
these are so buttery and creamy oh my
god it's like I bit with my finger these
are really buttery and they're so easy
to apply I would have to say that these
are a lot easier than the MAC lipstick
are the Mac lip liners if you guys have
tried those oh my god it honestly feels
like a lip balm it is that smoothing on
a lip
the smell is incredibly strong putting
it on my lips I can just that's all I
can smell cupcakes
no I'm just going to let it dry so first
impression of coke okay and the lipliner
it honestly feels so beautiful on my
lips it doesn't feel a drying at all
which is one of my biggest pet peeves
with likkle lipsticks because they just
get really crusty on my dry lips so
usually my lips on is dry but even with
really dry lips it doesn't like
accentuate the crustiness of them the
color is really nice I would have to say
it's like a true pink I don't think I
would ever wear anything this pink but
it is really ask you guys do you like
pink pink lipsticks and stuff I do just
prefer like reds and nudes and stuff
like that but so far I am so incredibly
impressed it just feels like he doesn't
even feel like I have anything on my
lips let's see how they feel to get off
the lips oh god they're not going
anywhere I feel like these are
definitely sound for a really long time
I can still taste a mint in taste I can
still smell the cupcakes I'm just gonna
pop some foundation over my lips that's
what I do usually the next shade that we
have here is it candy k I'm pretty sure
this is like the middle nude color so
let's pull her out and see what it looks
like okay so it's about one notes
probably about two shades darker than
the one I just tried on then I would say
if you are going to get these I would
only get one of these because they're
very similar
okay well it's going on a lot darker
than the one I just put on my god this
would have to be one of the best lip
liners I've ever used like the formula
of it is it's just incredible and I've
only is like it for like one second and
I'm already saying that like that means
it's good so let's try the candy Kay
liquid lipstick I actually really do
like this shade it's more of like a mole
be darker pink than the one I just tried
on when I first looked at the two I was
like these look really similar but when
they're on they actually do look very
different as you can see I would say
they dry in about 40 seconds so that's
really quickly I'm just going to keep
you guys zoomed in so the next one we
have is doll shake a
which i think is going to be my favorite
one I'm really really excited to what
this one looks like on my lips so this
is what it looks like in the tube a very
gorgeous brownie nude color Wow hmm that
comes on my lips a lot darker I feel
that is really dark so pretty there oh
my god
I definitely don't earn a color like
this which is saying a lot because I
have a lot of nude colors hmm I don't
know I actually like it like it's nice
but it's not my favorite next color I'm
trying on is 22 so this one is the
orange II kind of shade right here so
let's have a little close up kind of
like an off orange color I'm really
excited to see how this looks on my lips
because I've never want anything like
this anything remotely close whoa it's
very very opaque kind of like a pumpkin
color please excuse my messy application
after applying like two different liquid
lipsticks I'm sana get lousy well these
are all so pigmented it's actually
insane if you like this smell might be
giving me a little bit of a headache is
that because I have my hair pulled back
it's like you're really strong okay so
first impression of this color it isn't
as bad as what I thought it'd look on my
skin tone it is cute but it's not
something that I'd ever probably pick up
to wear
God if you like rub you lips it
literally does not transfer at all this
is this would have to be 100% the best
for me lid liquid formulated liquid
lipstick I've ever use I'm so impressed
even his car looks not that great on me
the next shade that we have here is a
marriage--okay which is the red so let's
see if it has any pink in it when you
put it on your lips I love red shades
and it's sad and excited okay it's
definitely showing up really like
blood-red oh wow it is really red what
the hell on the packaging at
pink yes that makes me happy
holy crap is it so easy to over drop and
it's like so butter which is like cool
oh my god I honestly can't get over how
strong that smell is this one is drying
really quick I literally just went like
10 centimeters over my lips and I'll
swing this on but the weird thing about
this was the lip liner wasn't as dark as
a liquid lipstick and I feel like it
might be a little bit patchy but the
color is really nice it's like a nice
deep dark red shade it's like a true red
it's still drying my lips are so stained
right now okay so the next one is Posie
K which looks like a purpley pink kind
of shade wow it looks a lot Pinker in
the tube then what does in the box when
she goes
mmm I don't really like the shade I
don't know I just feel like the other
pink shades look a little bit nicer this
one definitely is a bit more deep and
bit more purple than the others my lips
look freaking gorgeous the last one that
we have here is called K which is the
darkest purple yes I can't wait let's do
it oh my god this is a very very rich
purple so this is what court K looks
like it looks amazing I absolutely love
this color I'm just going to go over it
one more time because it does look a
tiny bit patchy around this area here so
if you like the more you go over at the
darker you'll get em what happened I was
like went like that and all the color
came off in the middle that's obviously
why she said I only put one layer on so
here I'm going with may 5th layer okay
I'm not going to blot I'm just going to
let my lips dry I would say this would
have to be the hardest one to apply
obviously the stock shade and it's so
easy to see like the imperfections
around the edges but this would have to
be one of my favorite shades it looks so
stunning with a winged liner vite lashes
so that we have my kylie jenner first
impressions on the liquid lipsticks I
honestly I love the formula of the
liquid lipsticks and the liners they're
amazing as I said before the best
formulated products I've ever used in my
life which is saying a lot because I
have so many liquid lipsticks and liners
a lot as far as the colors go I think
she did do a really good job with the
colors and choosing them if I was a pink
girl I did like pink lipstick then I
would definitely love all the Pink's in
here but I'm just not a huge fan of pink
I know she did come out with one cord
exposed oh that is a light nude that's
going to be out my alley that honestly
looks amazing because it's not that pink
um I would have to say I don't know what
wants my favorite probably the purple
that I have one now and the red with the
Pink's I don't really know I'm gonna
have to play around with them a bit more
anyways guy
I hope you have an amazing day and I'll
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
