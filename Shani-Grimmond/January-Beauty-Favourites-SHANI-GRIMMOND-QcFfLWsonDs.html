my channel so I haven't done one of
these like sit down to chat videos in a
really long time it's really good so in
today's video I'm doing my January
favorites I can't believe this month is
like really over already so weird I have
a lot of beauty products to share with
you guys today so let's go ahead and get
started the first product that I have a
literally been obsessed with is the two
phase of bonus way foundation I'm in the
shade warm beige everything about this
foundation is just perfect so packaging
is amazing the color match is spot-on to
my fake tan the coverage is super medium
to buildable so I like to have mine very
full coverage everything about it the
finish it's not too matte and it's not
through jewelry I just there's nothing
bad to say about this foundation I would
have to say this is one of my favorites
and it is just as good as my giorgio
armani
luminous look foundation except this one
is a bit more full coverage and that one
is nearly hundred dollars and this is a
lot cheaper so we'll definitely
recommend this if you are after a new
condition next thing is the Bobbi Brown
foundation stick I've never been a huge
fan of cream contouring until I bought
this this is in the shade 6.5 which is
perfect for me I know a lot of people
use a shade 6.5 so all I do is put it
under my cheekbone and add your thick
line and then I blend it out with my
Beauty Blender and it just looks so
bronzed
it's just the color that really makes
you look some kiss and ten it's just a
really easy way to contour you'd have a
breath I'm like every time I talk about
me I get so excited
yes I always you should think cream
contouring was kind of like a waste of
time so you can always just add a powder
bronzer to the face because it's so easy
to do that but I feel like this does
leave a little bit of a nicer finish
it's a bit more natural because it's not
like tout or anything so you have to get
this right now the next thing that we
have is a face wash this is the 5x
antibacterial wash a lot of people have
been asking what I've been using on my
face because my skin has cleared up so
incredibly much since probably about six
months ago if you guys watch my videos
I had pretty bad data turbo testy I had
pretty bad acne so I use this three
times a day in the morning and then
after I wash my makeup off in the
afternoon and then before I go to bed so
this gets rid of like oils and dirt and
stuff and it also helps prevent
breakouts and acne I love this stuff
Jonathan uses it on his body as well
when he gets little like red dots on his
back I never really cared too much about
my skincare routine until I went to get
my skin looked at professionally and
after that I've just been super picky
with my skincare so this is just fitting
it super well because you see it doesn't
mess up my pH levels which was one of
the things that was drying up my skin
before there was a few products I was
using that I would use to remove my
makeup and it would just completely dry
out my skin next up we have this Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder I'm
sure you guys have heard of this on the
youtube world when I first got it I
wasn't too fond of it I really didn't
like it at all but I've been using it so
much this month and I use it just set
out of my eyes with a Beauty Blender and
also right here so it has like a
chiseled contour effect so it like
cleans up that line and I love this
stuff so much
the longer you loo on it like the more
brightened it gets under your eyes and I
feel like it does cling to the little
lines under your eyes but it doesn't
look very powdery like an under eye
setting powder would so would Declan
recommend this stuff because it's kind
of like a multi-purpose product I use it
to set my arm what's called I primer and
then I use it to set my whole face and
then I use it for baking and all of my
core stuff oh my god can we please talk
about what is on my eyes right now I'm
so excited this is the Englert pure
pigment eyeshadow in the shade at 85
this is honestly so stunning it should
be unique as well it's not something
that you would probably have in your
makeup collection it's an iridescent
purpley green color so it changes color
in different lighting it's like a really
really fine glitter and what I use under
it to make it stick and to make it not
grow anywhere throughout the day
the true face glitter glue shadow
insurance this is one of the best
glitter glue I've ever tried it was
definitely recommend this if you don't
have one I'm definitely going to go back
and get some more pigments as well
iridescent ones I'm just living for them
two brushes that I could not live
without so this one is the Real
Techniques I think it's a powder brush
but I use it for a bronzer as you can
see it's an orange so just on my
cheekbones and around my face to warm up
I don't know what it is about this brush
but it just makes everyone's are going
so nice and seamless and blended and it
takes two seconds because it's like the
perfect size to do a little fat so I got
this for a price line and it was it was
60 skills on sale and I was really iffy
about buying it because that's a lot of
money for a makeup brush all of these
brushes right here were about twenty
dollars but if you don't have a good
bronzer brush right now I would
definitely recommend just getting this
just bite the bullet and get this
because honestly does such a good job at
bronzing up the face if you've already
got one I don't know $60 it's your
choice it's a lot of money but I guess
that is the only brush that I use to run
to my face now the next one is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter
brush this is the a 2 3 something about
the shape and the bristles on this brush
make my highlighter just slow pigmented
and so intense and it's just super easy
to select done
my dog has got to it and eaten it a
little bit so I had to give it a nice
deep clean this is hardly my favorite
favorite highlighter brush
speaking of anastasi I also bought all
their highlights but these are the true
that I've been obsessed with I have this
one right now it is called
a Riveria illuminator ok so this is what
it looks like right here this one isn't
as pigmented I feel as the soffel you
would one this is one that everyone has
been raving about so let's have a little
comparison right
so this one is so Hollywood and this one
is the one that I can't pronounce so
this one is definitely a lot more peachy
and this one's more on the golden side
so this one is kind of just like the
staple highlight that everyone loves so
if you're kind of choosing 22 I will
definitely recommend this one so
pigmented and when you put it on it's
like Oh calm down you guys probably knew
this was coming if you've been watching
my makeup tutorials for the last month
I've been pretty much only been using
this red right here it is the morphe
eyes shadow palette in three five zero
sorry this gets sawed out really quickly
I was lucky enough to get it in time
this is what it looks like right here
it's a lot of just warm colors I love
the oranges over here there's super
creamy and the quality of them are
amazing so if you are from Australia it
probably would add up to about $65 for
this um in American dollars it's like 25
bucks but $65 is what you'll pay if you
live in Australia next we have two
blushes these are from essence and
they'll probably three or five dollars
and they are better than half of my
other high-end blushes down there so I
had to give these bad boys shout out
this one is initiated at ten adorable
and this one is in autumn peach so this
one definitely is a lot lighter and I
feel like they both match every single
makeup look you can make them look
really subtle like a nice just a wash of
color on the face we can make them
really intense and just and you'll love
them last but not least we have a liquid
lipstick this is from the brand la
splash and it is in the shade innocent
vixen I've been wearing this every time
I go out clubbing just because it
matches every single makeup look it's
just like the perfect nude it's not too
pink it's not too pale it's not too Doug
everything about this is just incredible
except one thing it smells laughs so
then we have my January favorites I hope
you guys liked it I have so many makeup
products in my cupboard right now that
are new and I haven't used so I'm pretty
sure next month I'm going to have
a lot more things to talk about so yeah
I hope you guys like this video if you
did please please give it a big thumbs
up because it helped me out so
incredibly much and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
