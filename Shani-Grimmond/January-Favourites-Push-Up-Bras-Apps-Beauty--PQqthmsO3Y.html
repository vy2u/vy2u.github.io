today's video so I hope you're having a
better day than me I just got booked for
speeding I lost three points now I've
got one left so obviously that's a
lesson to learn in today's video I'm
doing my January favorites or what the
hell it is already February no words
this year is going so fast already I
can't even believe it so I haven't done
a favorites video since August and last
year so I thought it was about time that
I did one so I have a lot of like random
things to share with you I've got like
bras candles makeup items
apps and all of that so let's get
started right now oh one more thing take
a look at the difference I know it's
really bad it's disgusting I'm going to
scrub it off tonight the first thing
that I have to share with you is a
candle from glasshouse this is in the
scent vanilla caramel look at that it is
like black all over there because I go
to light it I'll go to like what kind of
the home so I go to light one week and
then I can't like the other one without
burning myself so I kind of go like that
and then a flame I don't really know
what I'm trying to say but this smells
absolutely amazing
my friend had it out of her house and I
walked in I'm like what is that smell it
smells phenomenal and then when she told
me I literally like went to go buy this
candle the same day I have had this
burning for hours like 12 hours and is
still like this much left one time
accidentally left it on for about six
hours while I went out which was a scary
scene coming back home to a candle that
was just like all like a liquid down
here I was like oh my gosh my house
could've burnt down
that's why I don't like candles that
much but it smells so good I don't know
if you guys are going to get weird out
to me talking about bras but I'm going
to anyway so I have quite small boobs
I'm like a b-cup and I want them to
bigger so I love to wear push-up bras
this is from bras and things it's
absolutely amazing
they don't really so many push-up bras
there so this would be easy to find if
you're interested in that it just has
like a little bow at the front with
black crosses in it oh my gosh this
makes my boobs look ten times bigger and
if you want your boobs look bigger
winner winner chicken dinner this is
amazing and I also have one other bra
right here this one is from cotton on
body this is a really real
nice one it has lace at the front of it
and it is super padded it has like tan
all in here because my tan melted off
onto my bra but yeah this makes her
boobs look really really good it
actually makes them look like a solid C
cup
so thanks thanks so much next thing I
have that's been amazing this month is
the Sony personal audio system I don't
know where this is from but I'm going to
try and find it for you guys and link it
in the description box but it is just so
little when I take it everywhere I go
it goes super loud and it's portable so
you charge it for about an hour and then
you can take it wherever you go and it's
just like connected with bluetooth so
you put your phone on it and you listen
to music so I love this oh my god this
went all under my frickin bum right now
it's so disgusting it's like a pool
anyways my next favorite over the month
of January my friend Chloe introduced me
to and I think it is the greatest
Gradius greatest creation on at this
planet seriously if the app called the
hunt and it's basically a fashion app
when you want to find something that
someone else is wearing you upload a
photo of it and then basically someone
finds a for you they send you a link or
they write a link on that post and then
you go ahead and buy it so I think that
is honestly this smiles thing in the
world why did I not have this app sooner
seriously so I posted a few things on
the hunt and they've all been found so
I'm going to do some online shopping
because because why not
everyone loves to a bit of online
shopping if you guys want to download
this app I'll have a link to it in the
description box it is amazing just trust
me you need to get it and I also have
one more app to share with you and this
is a photo editing app this is called
vsco cam it has the best filters in the
world honestly so all you do is you
upload a photo to the vsco cam and then
you choose a filter I'm going to show
you my favorite one because it is
phenomenal I use it for like nearly
every single Instagram photo that I
upload so let me show you right now it
is f/2 like it just makes the photo look
ten times better and I can't even deal
and you can also get the exposure up and
down in the contrast and everything so
it's like the only photo editor that I
use it is to die for and you need to
download it next thing I have here is
from Sigma this is the warm neutrals
palette I've been using this all month
oh god my characters car
as I'll saying it's perfect for daytime
and nighttime so we have a lot of pinks
and we have a lot of like warm brown
colors and purples and I think it's
beautiful every color in here is so so
unique they're very buttery and
pigmented and they last so long on my
eyes so I would have to say that this is
a beautiful palette and I think everyone
is is in their life next thing we have
here is my two favorite mascaras I've
been using these for quite a while now
it's the benefit they're real mascara I
use this one first to kind of separate
my lashes and make them super thick and
then to make them like extra extra thick
and really really long I go on with the
the balm or what's your type mascara oh
this is absolutely to die for
I'm not even kidding these two together
make like the most beautiful fat chunky
eyelashes and if you don't like clumpy
eyelashes you may not like this balm
mascara but I love that effect so when a
winner chicken dinner that's the second
time I've said that but when I say that
you know that I love it I'm actually
putting a towel down to sit on because
I'm sweating the dirt mop next we have
the Australis tint my brow Braton this
is in a shade black Brown I like to put
this through my brows because it adds
lots of texture to it and also makes
them a shade lighter as well I don't
know what it is about this but I can't
go a day without doing my eyebrows
without this stuff it just makes them
look the next thing that I have that I
have been using non-stop is the NARS
blush in your shade or more I'm so
scared to put my arm bleh look at my
hand I don't feel so insecure about it
not really anyways this is what it looks
like it's kind of like a dark like a
deep pink I'm so about describing
anything it's horrible but as you can
see it's just beautiful it goes really
really well with dark skin tones when I
have a really nice tan on this looks
absolutely amazing I don't really like
those hot pink kind of blushes so this
is like the next step for me and I think
it's beautiful and it's just so
pigmented I was just about to smell it I
don't know why let's talk about some lip
products so I have these colourpop lip
products right here that I really want
to show to you because they're so
affordable and I'm pretty sure they're
actually shipped to Australia now which
is amazing that probably would have been
out
face of my life for whatever this is the
colour-pop lippie stick I have this
shade button which is a really really
nice pink color this looks identical to
the Lancome lipstick in the shade at bay
bet identical I tell you this is so
incredibly incredibly pigmented it's
just a beautiful color and they also
have the lip pencils in the same shade
so this is in the shade button as well
so I go ahead and put this on and then
line my lips with the lip pencil and my
lips look gorge
I'm loving these products they're
honestly amazing and another shade that
I've been loving is in a shade bossy
it's a gorgeous red shade especially
this lip pencil though just I don't know
what it is they're just so creamy and
buttery and I'm obsessed with the lip
pencils even more than the lip stickey's
Libby stickies I also have been obsessed
with the Mac ramiro lipstick this is
like the most beautiful red color in
history of makeup I'm telling you it is
like the truest red I've ever met color
I'm shining as for you
you are so pigmented ha Lauri this just
lasts so long on my lips because it's so
matte it is super hard to apply because
it is so mad and just like chalk here
well I wouldn't say chalky but it's just
very dry but that's why I love it so
much because it lasts super super long
like god I talked so fast in my bad so
then we have my January favorites I hope
you guys liked this video and hopefully
it helped you guys out with some maybe
some new products they want to buy or
whatever you want or hopefully this
video was at least entertaining to watch
so yeah I hope you guys have a lovely
lovely lovely day and I'll see you very
soon bye so moving on to eyeliner I'm
just taking a black one and lining my
waterline and this never looks cute at
