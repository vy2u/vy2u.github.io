in today's video I'm doing a move bang
with all life
I'm so excited guys I'm really hungry
and I can't wait to just eat all this
Asian food so I have wait let me see
what I got cause I just ordered on uber
rates and I forgot so we have pad thai
Singapore Street noodles and vegetable
fried rice this is gonna be delicious
this is my new favorite place to get
food
oh my god it's cool he not straight
noodles I don't know if you guys have
heard of that that is what I'm talking
about oh yes honey berry sir um put some
lime in the top of that don't know why
that's the thing but it's a thing oh oh
so so you know when you're really really
hungry bought and you want like well I
don't know if it's the same with you
guys but I always want like burgers and
fries and stuff I switched over to
wanting this all the time it's literally
like my biggest weakness now does really
I mean I'm gonna eat all of my lipstick
off it's already coming off you know in
your lifetime you eat like one lipstick
I think I do you like ten okay so I have
a few things that I want to talk about
and the first one is my name Michael
sense of humor everyone's been talking
about it it's been all over the advice
pages horrible bullying website if you
guys don't know what that is so if you
guys want to mind of Michael's video
then little videos all the time you
wouldn't know a sense of humor is
literally just like banging each other
out like that's just what we do like
it's funny to us like we find a
hilarious
and I don't know maybe we've got like a
few new viewers or something and maybe
they're the ones that are offended I'm
not sure but if you've been watching us
for a while you would marry the a sense
of humor is just like very like brutal
like we rip each other's Souls into
shreds like we just think it's sorry
funny and like we obviously never go too
far like we don't actually hurt each
other's feelings and if we do we
obviously say something
should something else but on oh this is
kind of spicy it's good
we filmed three videos together one on
my China what Susan mukbang and then one
in his eternal which we kind of like
hashed out ow
argument like a year ago we just like
had this like weird little like argument
thing and we just spoke about on his
channel and we narrow it always gonna be
really close friends so I guess like
anything we say we know it's gonna be
resolved so we kind of just like hashed
it out and obviously because like you
guys are currently have a scene how it's
like laughing and joking around like a
feat like because you guys saw us for
like three minutes being serious and
talking about our actual like friendship
a lot of people were like oh my god like
you need to relax and I'm like oh yeah I
do need to relax I'm just a little bit
so I'm pretty sure you guys have just
had things really like brutally when
you're upset if someone hurts you like
that's just how it is like but me and
Michael have a friendship that can never
be ruined and I'm not gonna let anyone
try and talk about our friendship
because like well to be honest I don't
really care because we're not gonna
change for anyone so that's that you
know what I love Michael so much like
you have no idea I would do anything for
him just so that I would take a bow to
him so I don't think I mean to him don't
think he's mean to me our friendship is
just like a little bit unique you know
sorry I'm actually planning on going to
Europe in like three weeks or something
which I'm really excited about I don't
know what part of Europe and winnig are
true there's a few places in mind I'm
going with a few of my friends but um
we're thinking like one place is
Amsterdam or Spain or London I'm not
sure where we're gonna go yet but I kind
of have to choose what spot that I want
to go to so nobody's gonna let you guys
know when I'm going so then I can meet
some of you that are from there what
really so cool I really like this one as
much as the pad thai I also have Splenda
come out which is a music festival so
excited festivals that literally
everything to me like I love going cuz I
suppose and dancing and getting drunk
and like I mean you guys and hanging out
my friend
oh nothing better nothing better in the
world then dancing
I'm just getting rich I'm such like a
young soul I love partying way too much
may
said on Twitter how happy you - that you
moved out of your apartment
I love how they're like talking like
it's me and Michael filming a video
because we like always together
um but I'm just gonna speaking on behalf
of myself because he can say he can say
what he wants societies aren't Channel
um but I'm sorry happy that I moved out
of my los de pomme if you guys don't
know
I'm raped out of my last one because
there was so much construction I
couldn't I couldn't do anything it was
so annoying and like I just wanted to
move into like a house that was like big
and like I don't know something that I
just felt really comfortable and like I
hate living on top of people I hate when
people can literally just like see me
from the other buildings across the
street literally I couldn't even walk
out in my house naked because everyone
could see me that was like at least a
hundred and fifty people that could have
seen straight into my apartment like it
was serve at Sur I just want something
really private and really secure and
like safe and that's what I got I'm
really happy sort of thanks rusty and
thanks for caring if you guys know who
this is
router name in the comments because if
you know then your energy hey hey baby
okay on Twitter people keep asking about
Ariana Grande and Pete I do not keep up
with like celebrity news because I quite
frankly I don't really care like that
just his name is a success she's more
talented than me she is literally insane
I have no talent compared to her from
what I've seen she looks really happy
with this new guy and I'm so happy for
I'm happy for anyone that has found love
even if it's moving on quickly like
honestly that doesn't matter as long as
you're happy that is the main thing so
kudos to you Ariana girl power all the
way oh my god I'm sorry full already now
haven't even had much at all I think
it's the noodles that fill me out really
much really I should stop talking laughs
ow someone's head
leave you what's the greatest pot of
your life right now
hmm well
great question a lot has changed for me
over the past few months like I feel
like my whole life don't the testee I
feel like my whole life has changed and
it's crazy getting the greatest pot
right now is me and my family
ah so incredibly close me my mom me and
my dad I mean I would see my brother
Renee just cuz he moved to Melbourne
which was really sad but I'm gonna go
see him soon but I'm just so happy that
I'm really close to my family now I just
like relied on them a lot more after I
went through the breakup and it just
made me feel so much closer to them
knowing that would that for me and
supported me through everything and like
yeah me my dad so close like I literally
call him like every second not and just
like telling my life story and he's just
so supportive and I'm there I just I
have met a lot of many people as well
over the past few months and like like
just getting to know them is it's so
nice to like meet new people like I love
it so much and it's something that I
never really used to do so I'm really
happy that I'm putting myself out there
more your childhood growing up my
childhood was really really good
my parents broke up when I was in prep
for something and then again when I was
in high school and that's like really
like the early- thing that I can
remember my brother has told me that
like his childhood was like shocking and
like I mean like not because of my
parents but like he saw some shocking
things when he was younger that have
like scarred and fuller - I don't
remember because I was so young that is
first bye see you my brother my
brother's 20 oh I think we met very
close growing up but as soon as I left
high school I think like maybe when I
matured a little bit well we got really
close which I'm really happy about and
then when I was 10 that's when my little
brother and sister were born so I mean
my brother's sister like 10 and like 12
years apart
which is like such a massive age gap but
I just remember like when I was in high
school I was just
well primary school I was so obsessed
with looking after my little brother and
sister because there was like newborns
oh my god this is a really interesting
topic Abby said how to get past guilt
okay me personally if I ever did wrong
by someone
or I up in it anyway I get really
really bad guilt it's all I think about
until I tell the person and I apologize
and make it right it's just in my
personality like I have to make things
right otherwise I'll be living with that
guilt for the rest of my life and I know
a lot of people don't really care like
if they do something like oh just move
on like whatever I have to bring up with
whoever I've hurt and I have to
apologize a million times and I have to
get them to tell me how they feel about
how I made them feel you kind of I don't
know like lay it out on me please
so I guess my tips to you guys are just
confront the person you've hurt explain
your side of the story explain
everything you can as best as you can
really think it through before you say
it and then you've got to forgive
yourself because if you've apologized
you've tried to move on that is all you
can do it end of the day you tried to
make it better then that's also yeah you
got this I believe in you everyone makes
mistakes it's fine its life it happens
no one's perfect
don't don't stress about it too much the
last topic is breakups and learning how
to be happy on your own I'm just so full
actually um I feel like this is a
question I'm always gonna get now like
now that I've been through the breakup I
feel like everyone wants to know about
the break-up and bla bla but obviously
I'm not gonna get into personal details
because I just don't even think that's
necessary but I think the the best thing
to do with getting through a breakup is
accepting why you two broke up accepting
why you're better off without them the
most important thing to being able to
move on and be happy again in my opinion
is surround yourself with friends I've
been lucky enough to have the most
amazing amazing support around me and
like so quickly I've been able to just
like feel happy like so genuinely happy
and I would really give like most of
that credit to my friends for just being
there for me and my family and
everything and all the support that I
have so obviously at the end of the day
you are all you have to an extent I mean
like obviously your friends and family
gonna be there for you but you need to
be strong you need to put yourself first
oh my god the ovens on that's a slight
problem we could have blown up then yes
but just putting yourself first and just
being strong like you know that you can
do this you can know you can get through
the break-up you know that one day
you're gonna find someone that's gonna
make you so happy and someone that
you're meant to be with so I mean you're
gonna need to think about meeting
someone else but just knowing that
there's someone out there for you and
you're not gonna be alone forever no but
for now I guess it is good to just be on
your own and just like if you learned
for a bit and focus on yourself focus on
your work focus our new friends
happiness family all of that stuff you
guys know how it is like all right I
feel like when you go through breakups
you're eating or what advice to give
yourself but it's easier coming from
someone else because it's like someone
lets out of your mind telling you like
how to deal with things so if you are
through breakup that's a great way to
start you know I think watching someone
eat junk food is satisfying for me
anyway I was watched Trisha Paytas you
need mac him stuff like random off
Burger King love that I just get
satisfied watching someone else eat
Johnny because I'm like I don't have to
eat junk food no cuz I'm Sinkin someone
else you know I don't know let me know
what type of food you guys want me to
eat my next full bang and let me know if
you need black the ones sitting down or
if you like once in Macao hopefully
these flowers all that I got for my new
husband kidding so a company that I'm
working with love that oh I love you
guys so much give this video a thumbs up

channel if you haven't already thanks so
much for sticking to the end of this
video I love you I love you I love you
