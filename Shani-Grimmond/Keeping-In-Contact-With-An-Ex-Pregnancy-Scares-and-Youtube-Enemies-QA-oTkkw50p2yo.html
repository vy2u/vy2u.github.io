channel oh my god I'm sorry happy to be
doing a Q&amp;amp;A right now I haven't done one
in seriously the longest time so I asked
you guys to ask me on Twitter some
invasive questions and of course you
guys came through with some very
interesting questions so let's go ahead
and jump right into it please
I honestly hate watching q and A's that
are like boring as like what's your
favorite color rule like would you
rather have like a dick on your nose or
a dick on your mouth
it's just like no what do you know juicy
questions okay so the first one is
biggest or what the moment okay so
the weirdest thing happened the other
series so annoying okay so the other day
I got a DM right and I'm gonna read it
out to you and I was seriously like what
the is wrong with people it's it's
cooked and she said you said in your
boob job video that you were all about
being natural this is ironic because
there is nothing natural about you at
all in capital letters you get your
eyebrows tattooed lips filled you tan
your skin eyelashes extended and now
possibly boob implants what the and
I said hey you're so sweet illy because
I'm thinking shut the up let
everyone do what they want to do with
their own body if it makes them feel
better you guys know this talk if it
makes them feel better then how does it
affect you in any way shape or form by
the way I've never got my eyelashes
extended but thank you for adding that
to the list everything else I do yes I'm
a fake bitch I'm kidding so the what the
 moment in this she replies and says
oh I didn't think you would respond
oh my god that was actually so rude of
me what the I'm sorry you do you I
was just confused I guess I'm sorry ah
it's so easy to be made over the
internet because it doesn't feel like a
real person but when you responded I was
like what oh my god I suck so bad at
writing I was literally like why the
hell would I send that I'm sorry sorry
Oh what drugs are you on just because
I'm on the internet it doesn't make you
think I'm a real
and I a robot am i doing something
differently that you're doing am i
living my life any different way than
you know I've been getting online hate
for my whole YouTube career and to be
honest it doesn't faze me that's why I
just replied what's like he love you
because I'm like I don't care what you
think so it was just really funny to get
a reply like that because I've never got
anything like that and it just blew my
mind I was like really bitch
the next question is have you ever had
any pregnancy scares and yeah I have
actually I've had like three or
something it is honestly the scariest
thing in the world I'm sure few hasn't
gone through it as well when I'm just
being like late for my period or
something and you're like oh God a few
weeks after you a period isn't that
you've got to take pregnancy tests and
that's like the scariest thing when you
actually just have to like pee on the
stick and you're like waiting for the
line like just the one line to come up
so it says you're not pregnant and I'm
just like thank god I can't wait to have
a baby but like I'm honestly way too
young there's so many things I want to
do with my life before I do have a baby
so I lost my virginity two weeks before
I turned 16 so I was like really young
so when I was 16 I thought I was pricked
oh that's so bad yeah I thought I was
pregnant - my ex-boyfriend and his
sister banged me contraceptive pills and
you're the ones who take like every day
thirst pills like not the morning-after
pill like she gave she gave me those
pills and she said you've got to take
two now and then true tomorrow so I took
them and I was actually in vomiting my
gut stopped and at this point my mom
didn't know that I lost my virginity so
she was like why you vomiting like
what's her nose like I think I've got
the bug that was like the biggest lie I
ever told my mom I feel so bad I still
haven't taught it to this day but she
doesn't know I lost my virginity before
I told her because I went into the room
and I was like mom I have something to
like talk to you about I'm like I think
I'm ready to lose my virginity I already
had lost my virginity at this point but
I just wanted to break it to her and
then yeah sorry mom lied to you but can
you do let me the next question is do
you have any beef with any youtubers
no this is a biggest lie you've ever
heard no but seriously I did have beef
with a youtuber probably like six months
ago but then we spoke about everything
and we still did everything out it was
just like a misunderstanding you guys
probably know who it is I'm not going to
say who it is because I love this person
now so much so I don't know when things
happen on the Internet can just be sorry
misunderstood because talking online or
like versus talking in person is so
incredibly different because you can
take things out of context and stuff but
that's all sorted so I don't have any
beef with me what well I don't have any
beef with any other youtubers which is
great I love like supporting other
youtubers I I don't know why anyone
would have bass I guess people just do
it to get views okay
oh what's it called when people do diss
tracks Oh imagine would you feel weird
or rku is John getting into another
relationship I think let's be honest I
think every single person seeing their
ex get in a relationship is always going
to be weird it's not something you
really like what I see is about whatever
me and John are friends right now and
everyone was fully freaking out when I
uploaded a photo with bindi because we
went for a walk like we hang out all the
time and taste my manager as well so I
like this new beef at all we're really
close like I literally texted him in all
sac do you care people annoy that with
like friends and hanging out and
Stephanie's like nerve you always talk
about me there are no psyche I know I'm
sorry yeah but I love John I will always
love him how many how many times have
you wanted to slap Michael well I'm sure
you guys watch his videos and he's
 annoying so I want to slap him
every time I'm with him my friend oh my
god that reminds me
what's up wait noise so many weird
noises in this house I swear it's
freaking haunted but me and Michael have
much so if you guys want to buy anything
hit every 2sg the label comm we have
some amazing t-shirts and we're bringing
out some really cool pieces very very
soon
they're honestly incredible like a
comment to women all the time thoughts
on team
and honestly I think that they're very
motivated and I find that so inspiring
like that they're uploading every single
day but it might like earn mine an
opinion I'm just thinking how could you
literally dedicate your whole life to
YouTube black every single live living
breathing moment you like vlogging every
single day like I just don't get how
they don't get so relaxed to give
documenting everything obviously like
I've looks like ten minutes of your day
so it's not like the whole day but I
just feel like you've got to have like
time away from social media and like
just like be in the real world I don't
know hey that's just I just started how
they do it honestly like good one in
there what's the craziest thing I've
done while I've been drunk
I'm sure there's so many things that
I've done but like I probably can't
remember student to be honest but when I
was in Bali me and Chloe were dancing on
the tables which is something that I've
never done in my life I was very drunk
and it was amazing I was literally like
on tables dancing oh yeah and another
time this is the stupidest thing ever
but when I was like freshly eighteen I
remember I went out with Jonathan Chloe
and his best friend Sam and this was
like one of the first like a few times
I'd been out and I went out to a club
and I literally just like walked behind
the bar because I thought it was funny
to like pretend I was like pouring a
drink or something and I've literally
never been pushed sorry
 hard outside of that body he's
like what are you doing and I was like
oh my god I didn't think it looks like a
big deal to go behind the bar but that
shit's so illegal my dad which youtubers
would you smash let's stick to people
that I would date so it's like you know
more appropriate um I would totally die
can loli his black he literally has the
best personality well I mean you don't
know people because always he's dead but
yours but like from what I see he has
like a really good personality he's
really funny Cameron Dallas because he
is so attractive like are you actually
serious right now
Wow and he has a good personality as
well from what I can see him like very
outgoing and stuff that's what I love
I'm sure you guys probably agree with me
on there is true but I think that's the
only true
because I don't really watch too many
guys on YouTube and the last question is
how do you deal with not trusting boys
after they've stuffed you around so many
times so you feel like every boy is the
same that's a very good question
I've met so many guys that are like
complete assholes and whatever but I've
also met a lot of guys that are really
nice and I have a lot of respectful
girls I think you've just got to be
really careful like when you're talking
to someone not to like let your balls
down straight away be you know just be
cautious because you don't know people's
intentions and I guess it takes a while
to you know know what they want but I
think it all comes down to like being
careful and keeping your guard up just
for a little bit to kind of suss out
what they want and then you can kind of
tell from there I can't deal with it
yeah and then you can kind of tell from
the whether or not it's like worth
continuing on and obviously you're not
gonna continue on with anyone that's
gonna treat you like you know what
I mean
I know there's not really too many ways
you can stop it very like you can't help
your feelings if you like someone
they're an asshole and they stuff you
around like there's nothing you can do
about that you just you're just gonna
live in you've got a lying around
anyway so we have my Q&amp;amp;A I really hope
you guys enjoyed it it was very rated-r
I would say but like I'm not hiding
anything from you guys and I'm sure you
wouldn't hide anything from me if we had
this conversation full sitting down
having a chat so I love you guys so much
