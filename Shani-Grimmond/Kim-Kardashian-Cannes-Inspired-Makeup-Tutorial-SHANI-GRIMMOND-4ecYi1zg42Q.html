let's jump straight into this tutorial
I'm going to start by taking my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and I'm just going to
prime my eyes with this as per usual and
I just want to say sorry if my voice
sounds really quirky and annoying I'm
sick at the moment but I wanted to film
this video anyway so next step is to set
that pate pot with some powder just to
make sure all the eyeshadows on top
blend really seamlessly now taking this
really rich orange brown shade this is
going to be my transition so just taking
this in windshield wiper motions to add
a really nice wash of color in my crease
so all the products that I will be using
will be listed down below if you guys
are interested now taking my Too Faced
chocolate bon bons palette I'm picking
up a shimmery bronze and a medium brown
shade so I'm just going to pack this all
over my lid and to be honest I couldn't
see her live color at all in any photos
I was doing so much research so I just
thought I would kind of do it in between
so a little bit of shimmery and a little
bit of matte now with the most pigmented
black eyeshadow of my life this is the
makeup geek in the shade corrupt I'm
just gonna sketch out a wing oh my god I
am sorry bad at wind eyeliner eye shadow
anything so don't judge me I'm not the
best but I am slowly getting better so
I'm just gonna line my upper lash line
and just create a massive wing and then
kind of fluff it out a little bit
because Kim's was really smoky and
smudged out now with my vitamin-enriched
face space by Bobbi Brown I'm just gonna
pop this all over my face because my
skin was so incredibly dry this morning
and also Kim this face look really
healthy and glowy so this is the perfect
step
full foundation today I'm taking the
make up for ever ultra HD foundation and
the Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow and
that one is to add just a nice glowy do
to the skin and I'm just going to pack
this on with a Beauty Blender Kim's
complexion was absolutely flawless so
I'm just making a super higher coverage
so just quickly while I have like 20
seconds to chat I just want to say thank
you so so much for 700k guys it honestly
means the world to me I really wish I
could be on my a-game with filming but
this flu or cold or whatever sicknesses
is is taking over my life and it just so
annoying ah now it's time to conceal so
I'm taking the NYX HD concealer this is
actually an amazing concealer and it is
so incredibly cheap so just getting rid
of those dark purpley bags under my eyes
I don't understand where they came from
I was random and just going to blend it
out with my Beauty Blender this
obviously comes in handy so much ah I
need to buy like 20 of these we all know
Kim has that incredible highlight under
the eyes so I'm taking my Mac prep and
prime in the shade light Bruce just to
brighten up under my eyes the concealer
was more surgical tool out the
discoloration and this one is to
brighten
now it's time to bake under my eyes so
I'm taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm actually only out of
this stuff I need to get another one
ASAP it's literally the best stuff to
set under the eyes and all over the face
so I'm setting all over the face now if
I don't do this step it gets really hard
to blend out my bronzer and contour and
stuff so this is a must now going in
with that same black shade I'm going to
line my lower lash line from inner
corner to add a corner and when I'm in
the inner corner I'm going to bring it
down just a little bit so it accentuate
accentuate that tearduct area I've never
done a really black lower lashline so it
looked very dramatic on me and I'm not
used to it yet but just going in there
and blending it out so it's nice and
smoky now taking my benefit BADgal liner
this is a waterproof so it really does
stay in my waterline oh my god I can't
believe how intense this is so it's on
mascara I'm taking my Mac mascara I'm so
glad I picked it up it is honestly my
new Holy Grail is amazing at separating
and making them really wispy and long so
just prepping my top lashes for falsies
now taking a shimmery pearl shade I'm
putting this directly underneath my
eyebrow to highlight and then I'm gonna
move on to my lower lash line of mascara
and my voice is literally leaving the
building see ya for my favorite part of
any makeup look it is applying false
lashes I feel like this just makes the
whole look ten times better oh my god
that really hurt that really hurt now is
time to contour the face
Kim's contour wasn't overly dramatic but
we honor she has naturally defined
beautiful cheekbones so I'm just gonna
do kind of a light hand with this but I
kind of wanted to looks too dramatic you
know what I mean what was that anyways
moving on to bronzer I'm taking my NYC
smooth skin bronzer and putting this on
my cheekbones and also around my
forehead as well just to make sure it's
nice and warm and glowy
for blush today I'm taking my Mac in the
shade Melba this is a beautiful shade it
honestly matches every single makeup
look I don't know how but it's
incredible so Kim had a little pop of
color on your cheeks so I'm just putting
that on my cheeks and then blending it
back to my temples for highlighter today
I'm using the Ofra in the shade you do
you it is honestly amazing and I'm just
applying this with a fan brush for a
really light application but still
visible can't go without my highlighter
so here I am attempting to contour my
nose I've never really done it properly
before but I mean it really does make a
difference it actually looks like I've
got a nose job
Kim's nose is tiny and so pinched too I
just thought I would try it out anyways
moving on to the lips I'm just going to
take a nude lip liner this one is from
NYX it is incredible and it is super
cheap as well so just outlining them a
little bit to make them appear a tiny
bit bigger like Kim's moving on to
lipstick I'm taking the MAC lipstick in
the shade - I was tapping my lips like
this for a reason actually it was
because Kim's lipstick wasn't overly
dramatic so I thought I'd add a light
layer of it but it looked better with
like a full coverage lips it's what I
did last but not least I'm setting my
face with the M decay and makeup setting
spray cooling and hydrating I chose this
one over the long lasting because this
one has a bit of a glow to it I feel
like it just soaks up the extra powder
but yeah there we have the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did please give it a
big thumbs up because it helps me out so
so much I love you guys so much and I'll
see you in my next video PS I'm sorry
about my voice I'm about to go
punch myself in the head bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
