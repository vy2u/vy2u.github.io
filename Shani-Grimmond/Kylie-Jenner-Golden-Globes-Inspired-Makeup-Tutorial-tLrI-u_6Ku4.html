recreating Kylie Jenner's Golden Globes
makeups you look through stunning so
let's get started
the first thing I'm doing is taking the
Bobbi Brown vitamin-rich face base so
I'm just applying this with a Beauty
Blender this was my first time using it
so I'm not sure how I feel about it yet
but it did make my face feel super
hydrated okay so this is where things
get really annoying so when I went to
Mac I asked for the extended eye base
and Here I am using the skin refine Zone
treatment as an eye primer when actually
it's a face primer for oily skin
so at the time I thought it was the wrap
product they asked for but now I'm
looking at it it's definitely not so
here I am thinking it's a no primer and
now taking the morphe 35 K palette I'm
taking a medium warm brown shade and I'm
using this as a transition shade so
basically just making a shadow above my
crease just so everything else kind of
blends out seamlessly so I'm taking a
morphe blending brush to just buff that
in and now taking a cooler shade of
brown I'm going to put this directly in
the crease to add more definition and
Kylie really did wing her eye shadow out
so this is what I'm doing right now and
making it really dramatic it does look a
bit messy at the start but I will go in
soon with a q-tip and make it really
really sharp so I'm also bringing this
quite high up to the brow bone as well
and of course taking a really big fat
blending brush and blending out any line
so it looks super soft and then picking
up this shimmery brown shade right here
I'm just going to pop this directly on
my lid and make it super super intense
looking back at this footage I do think
I definitely should have went a little
bit cooler toned in the crease so keep
that in mind if you guys want to
recreate this I love doing this so I'm
just going to clean up those edges to
make it look super sharp and then I'm
taking the Nivea man post shave balm as
probably a lot of you guys know heaps
people have been talking about it on
YouTube and didn't realize how run it
was don't mind me went everywhere so
apparently this works as a primer and
makes your foundation stick so I just
thought I would try this out I will keep
you guys updated on what I think of it
so if your foundation I'm taking the Too
Faced Born This Way this is an amazing
shade it matches my fake tan so well I
absolutely love this foundation the
coverage is incredible and it's just
super moisturizing and I'm just applying
it with a damp Beauty Blender I love
watching this part
now taking my mac prolongwear concealer
I'm going to use this to cancel out the
discoloration under my eyes and also to
highlight so Kylie had a little bit of a
highlight under eyes it was nothing too
dramatic so once this is all blended out
it looks super natural but it's still
there so to set that and taking the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and I'm just going to use this with a
wedge and pack this under my eye this
works totally under my eye under my eyes
and this works so so well for the brows
I'm taking the essence stylist set and
I'm just going to be filling in my
eyebrows quite heavily so Kylie's were
super overdrawn and naturally arched so
I'm just going to try my best to kind of
mimic the shape of her brows we have
completely different eyebrow shapes so
it definitely doesn't look anything
alike but don't know what can you do
for the Bradburn today I'm taking makeup
geeks white lies so Kylie had a really
intense highlight going on it was
definitely Matt so this is the perfect
shade so I'm just popping this directly
under my eyebrow and kind of like really
building it up so it is really
noticeable
and then just wiping away all of that
excess powder under the eyes so for
contouring today I'm taking the Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in at 6.5 and
just blending this out with a Beauty
Blender on the side it honestly looks so
amazing and it's such an easy way to use
cream contouring this product or works
wonders so she didn't really have too
much of a contour going on on the
cheekbones but around the forehead that
definitely was a lot so I put quite a
bit there and just blending that out and
then taking that same crease color I'm
just going to use this on my lower lash
line so taking it from inner corner to
outer corner and really just blending it
until it looks really seamless and then
I'm taking the same color that we put on
the lid and I'm just putting this
basically over the top of that other
color I definitely saw a lot of like
shimmers under the lash line which looks
really pretty and super different so
Logan for this look and then taking an
eyeliner that is really similar to the
lid shade I'm just going to pop this in
my waterline and I'm using a wedge to
apply this sweater kind of like take and
you can see a little powder off under my
eyes
and then taking through makeup geek
eyeshadows I'm taking a matte white and
one that has a bit more shimmer I'm just
using this to highlight my inner corners
it definitely was a very subtle
highlight but it was still there
so for mascara I'm taking this covergirl
mascara and just hurting my lashes she
well I don't really know I didn't look
like she had falsies on it looks like
she just hasn't actually big lashes but
because my lashes are absolutely tiny I
thought I would put some like corner
lashes on so these are the Kerkar lashes
super easy to apply because they're half
love them now taking makeup geeks black
eyeshadow incorrupt I'm just using this
to line my upper lash line you can still
see the eyelash band which is like
really getting on my nerves so don't
mind that
and then taking essence blush in the
shade 80 autumn peach this is honestly
like the star of the show it makes
everything look so much better and
healthier and just a nice flush of color
on the cheeks so she did have a fair bit
of blush so just loading that on and
then taking over as highlighter in you
do you so I'm just really lightly
applying this usually I go crazy with my
highlighter but Kylie's was really
subtle so just popping that onto my
cheekbones and also on my Cupid's bow if
you want to have those big Kylie Jenner
lips and also just popping that above my
eyebrows and I apologize this ain't
popping and our people hate that word it
honestly took me so long to figure out
what lip color would match so I'm using
the earth fry liquid lipstick in the
shade below this is definitely one of
the best formulated liquid lipsticks on
the market it's so hydrating and creamy
and it lasts such a long time as well so
love this stuff so much and then to make
it a bit more nude I'm taking the myth
lipstick from Matt Doce Matt and Mac and
then I'm just going to pop a little bit
of a gloss over the top to make it a
tiny tiny bit shiny and there we have
the finished look guys I hope you liked
it if you did please give it a big
thumbs up because it helps me out so so
much I love you guys so much and I'll
see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
