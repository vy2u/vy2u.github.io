in today's video I'm going to do a
makeup tutorial using the collagen art
royal each palette I know I just did one
but I really really wanted to do like a
traditional I shall I look that she had
on the front of this packaging which was
like the blue in the lower lash line and
then of gold later I hope you guys like
this video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already I love
you guys and let's go ahead and jump
into the video by the way I'm not bold I
do have hair back her the first column
that I'm going to take is this one right
here the same as the last video that I
did if you do want to see like a full
review on the poet I'll leave a link
down below but this is what I use for
the transition shade at last time and
it's pretty much the only one you can
use to start off the crease color so
I'll just be doing it again I'm just
going to take it from outer corner to
inner corner it's a really light shade
so it's really easy to apply this will
whack it on next I'm going to be taking
this a medium brown shade right here and
then this one up here and I'm just going
to use a smaller blending brush to apply
this and keep this we're in a socket
here so we can add some definition so
just take it in a little tiny so can we
windshield wiper mushrooms you know how
it is then just going in with that one
turn in my crease the next day that I'm
going to take is this a bronze shade
down here and this one is going all over
the lid just with a flat shader brush oh
my god that is not pigmented at all I'll
try using a brush it isn't synthetic to
see if sort of close better and I think
Kylie's tried to make this eye shadow
like a glittery eyeshadow but it's
honestly just really dry and patchy and
it's not sticking out what heaps of fix+
on it's just taking put as well next I'm
just going to take a black eyeshadow
with a little eyeliner brush this one is
from makeup geek and it is called
corrupt so I'm just going to line my
upper lash line and smoke it out a
little bit that's what it looked like
Kylie had on in the photo
primitiveness but there's no black in
here or I must use a different one okay
so let's move on to the face so I'm
going to take the Rimmel stay matte
primer and I'm just going to put this in
my t-zone I want the middle of my face
to be nice and it's nice and matte and
then I'm going to add a like really
iridescent one on the other part of my
face
I hate if there's a glow around this
area right here because that's where the
sweat naturally comes out so let's keep
that away now to add a bit of a glow on
the outside of my face I'm going to take
the Mac strobe cream this one is a
sample it's like a peachy color so I'm
just going to put a little bit on my
cheek bone and I'll just lightly dab
this into my face so for the foundation
today I'm taking this a Neutrogena
Healthy Skin and a liquid makeup in the
shade 85 honey this one is very tan so I
guess we're just going to work with it
like we do in every other video when I
went to LA to get all lots of makeup
that's really liquidy oh my god I got
really dark shades because my tan was
really dark I had like 20 coats of fake
tan on sure I have to work with what
I've got I really want to see if this
one's good so I'm just going to blend
this in with a Beauty Blender whoa the
coverage is really nice
definitely very wet oh my god you can
still see the max strobe cream through
there that's what I'm talking about I
actually really like the color of this
foundation it's like a nice yellow a
neutral tone this foundation is making
my skin looks so healthy
and just like skin like it doesn't look
cakey at all for the concealer today I'm
taking the Smashbox Studios skin 24 hour
in the shade light/medium so I'm just
going to use this to can slap the
discoloration oh I think she's thrown
lower and then I'm also going to take D
a lighter shade and put this on top to
just a bit of a highlight so I'm just
going to blend this in with my Beauty
Blender
and of course I'm just going to bake
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I do this all the time to set my face
I'm going to take the makeup forever
jewelry matte foundation powder powder
foundation it feels dry so I feel like
it's going to set the foundation so I'm
just going to cut discs all over my face
it's bloody cool noise I try and change
up the products that I use and then this
happens now it's time for the lower lash
line so I'm going to take this a royal
balloon right here and just going to
learn that from a de cornet in a corner
hopefully this isn't overly powdery and
doesn't go everywhere I'm just going to
pack it down so it's really intense and
then with a different brush I'm just
going to go in with this color and put
it a little bit under the blue now just
going in with some mascara I'm going to
current my bottom lashes a lot just so
the blue doesn't look as like weird if
you know what I mean I'm going to go in
with some black eyeliner on my waterline
this one is the Stila smudge stick
waterproof eyeliner in the shade
stingray I absolutely hate applying
eyeliner and of course I'm just going to
go in with some false lashes or just
fluff in it you don't want that thank
you I can already tell that this is
going to make everything look so much
better now to add some color to my face
I'm taking this Rimmel London highlight
contour and blush a little palette right
here or girl and I'm just going to pick
up the middle shade very lightly and
carve out my cheekbones
a little bit goes a very long way with
this product so don't be too generous
next I'm going to take the Milani baked
bronzer I have the shade golden this one
is a little bit shimmery so it's going
to add a nice glow to the face so let's
start and letting this in what and of
course I'm just going to break a little
bit right underneath to my bronze up so
she's nice and sharp I'm going to take
the blush and highlight out of the same
palette so the blush I'm just going to
put it on the apples of my cheeks and
blend it back I don't want to add too
much so just because that blue on the
eye is like really dominating the makeup
look so I want the rest of the face to
be nice and neutral as per usual I'm
going to go in with the highlight oh yes
thank you
I love blending away this bag it's so
satisfying because it just looks so
clean for the lips today I'm taking the
Kylie lip liner in exposed I never use
her product so I thought if I'm doing me
I shall look I may as well just use all
the products so I'm just gonna go it is
worth look when it's broken
of course going in with the matching
liquid lipsticks so yeah
just with a little bit of the Kylie
gloss in the shade so cute I'm just
going to put this on the center of my
lips so they appear a little bit bigger
you know why and lastly I'm just going
to take the touch I'll luminous dewy
mist
I've used this like a million times but
I can never see a really big difference
so I'm just going to do this side and
see if you can tell okay so this is the
side that I sprayed the time that I
didn't oh yeah I guess it does that
igloo okay okay so here we have the
finished look I really hope you guys
liked it
overall I don't know I as I said in my
last video not a massive fan some colors
work really well some colors don't work
the best I can never put my trick is
like really tight because they have long
nails whoa so annoying anyways if you
did like this video please give it a big
thumbs up I know it is quite similar to
my last one with the peach transition
but honestly this doesn't offer too many
transition shades at all so I kind of
had to work with what I had I love you
guys so much don't forget to subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
