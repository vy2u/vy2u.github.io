channel so in today's video I'm doing a
full glam makeup tutorial using the
royal peach palette by Kylie cosmetics
I'm really excited to see how this goes
because I haven't even squashed it yet
so I'll be doing a short review in this
video as well to give you guys a little
idea of my opinion so yeah let's go
ahead and jump straight into the video
so I just primed my eyes off-camera I
don't know why I do that before viewing
the palette because now I'm looking
really weird but anyways let's review
the palette so first impression I think
the packaging is really nice it's nice
and heavy it feels expensive the other
Kylie pallets were I really light and
packaging did feel a little bit cheap
but I do think this one is a lot better
and of course this one comes with a
mirror so I'm sure everyone's going to
be happy about that my okay I was going
to say my first impression on the colors
but I got distracted by the smell so
I've been smelling this palette for like
a whole minute now trying to figure out
what that smells like it kind of smells
a little bit chemically I don't know if
it's the packaging or if it's the actual
eyeshadows but some eyeshadows like all
these on here don't smell but for some
reason these ones do smell like really
grown a lot of eyeshadows that I am
obsessed with do smell quite weird or
smell like kids makeup but they work so
well so I don't think that's really
anything to be worried about people just
like to find things to really bash
Kylie's brands so they make a big deal
out of something that's not really a big
deal so my first impression on the
colors were it looks a little bit messy
just because of this blue that's in the
middle and I would like if there was a
darker shade so it can darken up the
look but I guess the whole purpose of
this is to be like the Royal Peach
palette so the Royals coming in with
this beautiful blue and this nice rich
gold and then all of the peachy colors
in here as well so let's go ahead and
swatch them and see how they go I'm
really intrigued to see how this blue
goes so that's the first color oh my god
or that feels so buttery I was not
expecting that okay
let's go in and swatch this coppery
shade on the bottom all that feels a
little bit chalky I think because
there's like lenders sticker glitters in
this one like it's not so much a shimmer
it's more like a chunkier glitter it
does feel a little bit Scratchy
I'm going to swatch the screen one so
that feels a lot smoother a lot more
like buttery so it definitely looks like
less glittery it just looks like a nice
sheen so I just went ahead and swatch
them all on my arm as you can see right
here and it's really confusing because
some of the colors in here are really
pigmented the ones that I think really
stand out I like this really shimmery
and copper shade this blue is really
nice this matte Brown down here but this
one here like the peachy pink color is
kind of patchy and powdery and a little
bit dry so I do think the formulas in
this palette are a little bit
inconsistent but that's what's going to
happen if you have like matte shimmers
and really chunky glittery eyeshadows so
overall I am pretty impressed with the
quality of the formula in here and I
guess we're just gonna have to see how
they go on the eye the brush that comes
with the palette actually looks like
just a typical a blending brush it looks
really good so the first change that I'm
going to take is this one right here
which reminds me a lot of the makeup
geek Peach Smoothie so I'm just going to
start by putting this into my crease as
the transition shade and first
impression they are going on beautifully
it's always very hard to tell if an eye
shadow palette is good just from
watching them on your arm it's always
better to go in on your eye and see how
to go there but so far all the matte
shades and the Kylie Jenner palettes
have been really good to consistent so
the black eye shadow brush right here is
what I usually use to blend out my eye
shadow I would say that the Kylie
cosmetic one is really long like all the
hair is really long on there so it is a
little bit harder to blend out the edges
I would definitely prefer this one and
one scenario she probably doesn't use
brushes herself the next shade I'm going
to take is this warm Brown right here
I'm just going to go in with the colors
that I would typically use if I was just
like playing around with a pellet I love
my warm
so this one's just going to crease as
well they're not going to bring it up as
high with this little shader brush from
that same at Kylie brush kit I'm just
going to pack this brown shadow on the
outer corner of my eye so this brush is
really really good at packing color on
now taking some mac prolongwear
concealer on a little angular brush I'm
just going to create a little cut crease
from the inner corner to halfway to my
eyelid because I love to on cut crease
then of course just painting my inner
corner with a bit of concealer okay so
the next shade i'm going in with is this
one right here I thought it would tie in
perfectly with the pinch thing that we
have going on and I'm also going to put
this blue on my lower lash line I'm
pretty sure just so it's like the
classic Kylie Jenner royal peach pearls
look okay so let's go ahead and pack
this on the lid I know I do this all the
time but I feel like it needs a little
bit of a pop of glitter because it is
quite matte so I'm going to go in with
this Urban Decay glitter liner in a
shave Midnight Cowboy and I'm just going
to line where I created that cut crease
I'm just going to take it into about
halfway I feel like this palette is
really missing a dark shade to darken up
any eye look this is the darkest color
in the palette so I'm gonna have to take
a different shade this is from makeup
dig I'm just going to pack a little bit
of this darker Brown on the outer edge
right here because I really tried to
pack up that other colors and make it
really dark but it wasn't dark enough
don't forget to blend the two shades
together I'm just slightly going over
the transition so it's nice and smooth
okay finally let's move on to the skin
so I'm going to start with the benefit
the Porefessional primer I just have a
little baby one right here so this one
is just going in a cheek area right here
to fill in any pores and also in my last
line because I always get foundations
seeping in their next product I'm taking
is the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base I do have really dry skin so I love
thing that's going to really add
moisture to my skin this is nice and
rich so it feels incredible full
foundation today I'm taking video air
flash and I have to shoot 300 so I'm
just going to go in and apply it with a
hmm
just a little synthetic brush make sure
you shake it up and oh just a little bit
messy but it is a really nice formula so
you half my face at a time this has
really nice and medium to full coverage
oh I would say that it is a little bit
too light for me at the moment I think a
little bit of 10 on my net but we can
just use it a bronzer to warm eat all
that circle matches oh it's so cold when
I go in the face it feels amazing now
for concealer I'm going in with the LA
girl Pro conceal I have the shade at
porcelain which is going to be really
light I'm not going to take that shade
instead I'm going to take the bare
minerals concealer in the shade light
this one isn't as pale and we're just
going to cancel out any discoloration
under the eyes oh this is school lives
on how you're doing going on and of
course I'm go into town and blend that
up I'm just using a Beauty Blender and
damn it on everyone last me for how fast
I do this now said I can do it down I'm
taking my a spun powder and I'm just
going to bake underneath my eyes so just
putting away any creases and going
straight in I have a musician so long
there's like hardly any left a good grab
some sight better it's tell it in
Australia I don't know where to get it
from to add a bit of color back into my
face I'm going to take the benefit hello
flawless in it B shade honey and I'm
just going to pack this all over with a
really dense kabuki brush and as you can
see here it's a little bit darker than
my face so it's just going to add a hint
of color and coverage now it's time for
the lower lash line so I'm going to
start by taking this shade down here and
I'm going to run it from outer corner
all the way to inner corner this color
is literally everything now for mascara
I'm going to take the bomb
what's your type of scar I absolutely
love this stuff now I'm just going to
take this a white eyeliner from it's
still art and I'm just going to line my
waterline so my eyes are nice and bright
and big and open now it's time for
lashes to make the eyes pop so I'm
taking these ones from Lily lashes in
the style goddess and they're absolutely
stunning okay so I'm just going to get a
little mirror a look down and place it
as close as I can to my lash line moving
on to contouring the face I'm going to
take the hoola bronzer by benefit I
haven't used this in so long so I'm just
going to take a little bit or an angled
brush tap it off and just put it right
under my cheekbones and then to warm up
the face I'm going to take this Rimmel
Sun shimmer three-in-one bronzer in gold
princess and I'm going to pick up these
two shades right here and use it as a
rubber so I'm just taking it on a really
big fluffy brush so we're going to work
the same gun I'm also going to take this
along my hairline as well to sort all
kind of comes together wow we are
definitely bronzed now okay so to clean
up this run guy I'm going to go in with
the Rimmel stay matte powder in a shade
transparent if you guys watch my videos
you would know that I'm obsessed with
this stuff so I'm just going to take a
little bit on my brush and run it under
my contour so we can clean it up a
little bit I always bring my bronzer and
everything down a little too fast this
is just like an easy way to really clean
it up in literally two seconds I
literally haven't used this product in
so long so for blush today I'm going to
go in with the bum
cindy lou manizer blush it is very
shimmery pretty much like the pink
highlight so I'm just going to put this
on the apples of my cheeks I love it
Robert now it's time for highlight so Oh
hilarious close I always start by
spraying my brush with some mac fix+ to
make the highlight or
really intense and then I'm going to go
in with be at NARS albatross highlighter
it is very light and it's definitely
going to show up so let's do this
the brush that I'm using is an NSF dia
23 it is the best highlighter brush ever
current ten stitches and what you're
going to put this on put it my nose
keep it oh my god that just went all in
my eyeball or oh my god you know what I
just realized I was supposed to do the
blue on the lower lash line that
probably won't even much so would it do
you I mean what is even going to match
that blue maybe like the gold shade so
that's all last but not least I'm going
to go in with the jeffree star velour
liquid lipstick in a shader leo I feel
like this is going to match perfectly to
this eye so let me zoom you in hon I'm
just going to start by applying it
straight from the tube and then I'll go
in with a brush to the second
and then just on top of that I'm going
to take the Anastasio Beverly Hills a
liquid lipstick in the shade a milkshake
I do this all the time
I just slap on my lips you know I'm just
going to put this in the middle and
blend it out and then lastly to finish
off the lips I'm going in with the to
taste sweet peach peach fuzz lip gloss
and then use either for oh that smells
amazing I'm just going to put a light
coat over the top so you can still see
what's happening underneath
lastly I'm just going to go in with
these skins and areas and makeup
finishing spray all over my face so here
we have the finished makeup look as I
said in my last video where I was
reviewing Kylie's pallets
there's something in her eye shadows
that make my eyes sort irritated I have
a message hunk of either that's
completely gone now just because it's
leaking so bad it feels really itchy and
but overall I would have to say that I
personally wouldn't buy this palette if
I wasn't reviewing it that's pretty much
the only reason I bought it just because
I feel like there's a few things missing
with this palette I feel like it needs a
darker shade so you can really make a
smoky look because this is honestly like
the darkest shade in here notice the
thing that's really good enough but I
don't know there is some cool looks you
do I feel like if you put this one in
the crease this one on the lid it would
look amazing this color here is quite
chalky soon wear this one up here but
understand with every pillow there's
always some good things about it some
bad things about it I don't know yeah
just not my cup of tea but if you guys
like these colors I think it would be a
great palette for you so yeah I really
wish I did more of like a new lip more
than like a purple because I feel like
it would go I don't would be eyes but
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and found it helpful
