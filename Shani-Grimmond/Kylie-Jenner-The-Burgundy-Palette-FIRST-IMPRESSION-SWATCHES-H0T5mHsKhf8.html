welcome to my channel so in today's
video I'm gonna be doing a first
impressions on the kylie kyoto pressed
powder eyeshadow palette this is the
rose gold no it's not it's the burgundy
palette I didn't get the bronze palette
just because I'm not really into like
cool toned eyeshadows so this one by the
looks of the photos looked absolutely
stunning so first things first I think
the packaging is beautiful it's so Kylie
so sleek I know that the new eyeshadow
palettes that she's coming out with next
does have a mirror in it and I know a
lot of people are happy about that so
this is what the palette looks like I
think it looks stunning oh I am really
excited to swatch all of these colors so
let's have a little close-up of all of
them we have gold Burgundy's oranges and
warm Browns that is literally everything
I want in life this is stunning this
palette we're just looking at it I can
definitely use every single color except
this one looks very basic all I just
watched it for the first sorry I'm
getting too excited in this palette we
have 6 matte shades and then we have 3
shimmery shades and by just looking at
them I have a feeling they're not going
to be over overly like glittery I think
they're just going to be like a nice
shimmer on the lid I do like really
intense glittery eyeshadows but I guess
that's just not what this palette offers
right let's have a little swatch I'm
just going to swirl my finger in there
okay so the mats are very very pigmented
when they swatch on the finger now let's
try the shimmery shades oh they are
really pretty as well okay let's swatch
some other shades I'm going to do the
pink and the bronze up the top that
color payoff is really really nice okay
so so far so good
I like the mattes the shimmers are nice
they're not too over-the-top so now I'm
going to come in close and personal and
show you the swatches on my arm so you
can see what they look like swatched
this is going to be messy
so here we have all of the swatches
there were definitely a few that really
stood out to me overall though I am very
very impressed with how they swatch
they're very pigmented and buttery they
were a tiny bit powdery a little bit of
like powder went into the air and I did
have to swatch it twice for them to
really stick on my skin but I am really
really impressed so the true that stand
out to me so much is this one right in
the middle it's just so pigmented look
at this color when it's washed on I was
like oh my god and then this gold right
here so you know how before I said that
I had a feeling that shimmery shades
wouldn't be over overly glittery this
one definitely is this one's more of
like a chunky glitter compared to the
rest the rest you can't really see the
shimmer too much now that I have my
first impression on the shadows I'm
going to go ahead and do a little eye
shadow look and see how they blend on
the eyes but I have a feeling they'll be
really really good just quickly I'm
going to prime my eyes because they
always use primer when I do my eye
shadows anyway so it wouldn't make sense
not to I'm just using my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and then I'll just
set it down in place with a powder the
first shade that I'm using is penny and
this one is going directly in my crease
as the transition shade so this would
have to be one of my favorite shades in
the palettes like a really nice orange
oh my god this is stunning the color is
transferring really nicely onto my
eyelid and it's just like gliding on
like butter
yay didn't expect anything less though
so I have a little bit of product on my
brush just watch how easily this glides
on Wow
now I'm taking the shade at Beech on a
really big fluffy blending brush and I'm
just going to use this to blend that
orangie shade with my skin tone I guess
just so it doesn't have like a harsh
line this is like a sandy Brown so it's
really going to blend into my skin tone
oh wow
well is easy and of course I'm gonna
pick up the shade burgundy because it is
a star of the show let's be real this
looks very pink on the brush okay so
this is going directly in the crease
let's see oh well here minted now I'm
taking the shade a brick on an even
smaller little blending brush and this
is going to go on the outer half of the
eye really darkening off of it now I'm
taking the shade of LA and that is going
in this little gap right here I'm going
to start by not using any fix+ just to
see how it goes on its own usually I'd
use fix+ but let's just see well I
literally I don't even have anything bad
to say about this eyeshadow palette like
I thought there'd be something that I
wouldn't like because I'm so picky but
maybe not I am going to spray my brush
anyway just because I want to be like a
foiled eyeshadow it should look
something like this when you do have the
fix+ on then I'm just going to pack it
down oh yeah so it's chunky we have a
tiny bit of fallout just because I am
packing so much on so with this gold I'm
just going to bring it a little bit over
that last shade that we put on the outer
half just so that is it just so the two
colors are blend in to one another okay
so I'm going to go ahead and finish the
rest of my makeup and I'll be right back
so here we have the finished makeup look
I really hope you guys enjoyed it for
some reason my eye is leaking on the
outer corner it's some kind of
ingredient in whatever makeup product
I'm using I'm really hoping it's not
this palette that is irritating my eye
if you guys know of any ideas of what it
could be please let me know in the
comments below because I'm sure it
happens to tell me you guys as well but
as far as the palette goes I'm extremely
impressed with it if you don't have any
colors like this I would definitely
definitely recommend it even though I
have all of these shades I was like I
have to try the Kylie palette and it
definitely definitely didn't disappoint
me so yeah
that is all I have to say I will have
this whole makeup tutorial on my
Instagram at SHINee crewman if you guys
want to follow me on there and check it
out

if you haven't already I love you and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
