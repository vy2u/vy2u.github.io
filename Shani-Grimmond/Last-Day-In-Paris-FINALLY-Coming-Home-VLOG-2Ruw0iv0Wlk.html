feeling is so incredibly sick but that
is not stopping me from exploring today
or vlogging Oh
low-key dying so today I have a few
things planned so I'm not going to tell
you guys it's going to have to wait and
see what I'm doing because I always
change my mind last minute anyway so I'm
just going to do my makeup to try and
find a cute outfit I really don't have
much cause that I haven't already bought
except to stuff I bought yesterday and
yesterday's world but uh I don't really
have like a matching penis to work I
just want like random bits and pieces
and then dry cleaner I meant he doesn't
have an iron per please we're drying
that piece of work since we are on our
way to find my CV work the wiggler
yes probably going somewhere like we
went last night stuff around the corner
near a capella but this is what I'm
wearing today in orange crop drones with
just Holly these pests from question

from but loving it I'm afraid they
waited my whole life it is
we have a big bag of goodies in there

cheese
I think so we're cool so we are going
over the cottage from Pawtucket
tofu my pan yeah twelve years let's PBS
oh yes many of my oh wow I'm going to
talk English like a million yeah okay we
made it holy but a problem because how
pretty all the trees are and learn
nothing
yeah
the next step is to guard Chanel so it's
going to jump on the two of us so we go
to yesterday because I really don't how
to get they'll wait until attacks
gravity guard and we don't have internet
sorry that's a joy to ride oh my god I
just bought this new bag so it's the

to do to get on that one alright guys so
I'm finally home ninja understood thirty
hours of traveling which was amazing I'm
really happy home filthy I'm really
happy it's a shower I've shaved my pits
the dogs happy well Ben's really sleepy
right now oh but it feels so good to be
home I have a lot to do I need to get my
nails done because I took two of them
off when I was bored on a plane I need
to get P vaccinated it's just so much oh
good to see I don't know what else about
to go shopping see I just used the
channel racer and oh my god it worked so
well that's a second time I've used it
now so I didn't really do my legs
properly because I couldn't be bothered
cause I just want to get in the shower
and just like get
but I did my arms and it just cut off
instantly so I'm really happy with that
I will do a full video on a very
stirring that I'm actually just like
Robert my buddy left it for a few
minutes and then got in and just like
lightly scrubs came right off and I was
like war he thought it was good didn't
he yeah actually it was like oh my go if
that's really coming up like this didn't
come for a cuddle oh yeah they missed
you the jokes are happening they got
home no you're being so clingy Ben
Calicut Britney's why solar energy so
yes that's what I've loved the rest of
today we're going to make settle in home
with me
have you made multiple terms I thought
maybe it good time just don't or Michael
at the house so clean and really happy
with that here was one that was that I'm
looking after the talks well was gone
of course of a Gucci bag here you like
to budget bonus stuff everyday B's
 life I have it so much I'm
packing to do but I'm so angry
this bag which is a really good brand it
was $400 it popped the zip up popped
where can I please have a refund Lucas
wants to life okay so right now I'm
going to get some late breakfast super
hungry and green is so excited who's
ready to go
jump in Barbies we're going for a rat
thank you
ocean even tell my cousin Jimmy way all
right I get it
we just slept for like 30 hours
well I did and then motivate and Bulbul
I have to hold key because he has to
have your second vaccination
okay I have tooken up shake I said to
myself I'm gonna eat healthy when I get
home but you're not expressed you know I
ate so bad
what are you doing and then I got my
favorite breakfast smash of our in photo
and poached eggs and Luckett alright so
it's time to unpack my suitcase and my
theory is that someone's broken into it
and stole my Gucci bags I just bought I
reckon true because it was locked I just
unlocked it then and also knowing how to
do to drive in it no but what Eric and
may just saw the suitcase in the lack or
no suitcase I'm going to steal stuff
also we know but it's because it was
locked they think there's valuables in
it no yes well I would have popped when
it's a $400 okay we also have locking I
would like off giving nothing there
because I don't see one of those typical
 boring people that will lock
less importantly will yeah whatever I
just like I'm a little bit skeptical and
I'm really concerned say what's not in
there
leave my Gucci bags in here oh my god
it's gone another problem the only thing
that's valuable in that bag anyway creep
in
you look really yellow yeah I think
everything's in here to be honest source
exact same the next step is to go
through what I've worn and what I
haven't throw the dirty stuff in the
bathtub because that's our washing pile
this needs to be put away can't wait to
do that tomorrow
look what Michael did to me I just look
into my makeup room for the first time
and Michael has cleaned this out of
it so we thanks my darling
I also have a package from Too Faced
that I want to open let's see oh my
 god this is so nice of Too Faced
thank you so much I have all of these
ones already I think there's another one
Olivia so I guess I'll just um add this
to my giveaway pile and then we have
another package

go back okay alright so let's do a
little haul of what I've got I just um

clothes so that's gonna take some time
to sort out the back on hangers but more
sort of a burn honestly you're
not going to sleep right now you're
buying me Z's because you're sorry
materialistic and then here I am about
to show almost okay so the first thing
that I have that materialistic is a very
scarf
everyone's materialistic people buy
night clothes instead of target because
they're materialistic there's just
different extents anyways this is like
nice and soft Europe II sleep on that
and then I got this top from Nike it's
literally just like a basic tee yeah
then I got this out of us jump ah this
