so in today's video I really feel like
just playing with makeup having a little
experiment so I really want to play
around with these Natasha Turner Anna
pilots because they look so beautiful so
let's go ahead and jump into them by the
way I do have blue eye contacts in if
you're wondering why I look a little bit
different
well a lot different because this
changes like everything let's go ahead
and start with the eye brows so I'm
taking this eyebrow powder by Mello
cosmetics in the shade maca and I'm
gonna pick up the darkest shade because
my brows are super dark right now
because I do have them tattooed on so
what I like to do is start at the arch
and really define this area up here
that's where I get all of my shape in my
brows at the top because at the bottom
they're quite straight let's do a line
underneath make it nice and neat and
then I like to extend my tail a tiny bit
oh my god these eye contacts are like
making my vision blurry what's going on
so if you guys didn't know I have much
so if you guys want to check it out me
Michael did a collaboration and we have
it so many clothes well it's all tops
and t-shirts and all that so I'll leave
the link down below if you guys want to
check it out but they're really cool I
give you guys a little look over here
but I am so excited to drop the next
launch you guys are gonna love them okay
sir I just went ahead and primed my eyes
and I'm having a look at this palette
and I really really want to use this
Butler with this color in the crease or
in the true palette says marry like
transition shade really except this one
so I want something a little bit lighter
so we can ease into that one so what I'm
gonna do is go in with my makeup geek
eyeshadow palette this also has an ax
star zero as well so I'm just gonna pick
up this shade right here
I haven't dipped into this palette for a
while this is burnt orange by Anastacio
I'm gonna take that on my m51 8 brush by
morphe and we're just gonna take the oh
my god nor there was something wet on
that brush and it just went crazy on my
eyelids okay a new brush hopefully that
blends out cuz that's a problem
these eye contacts are actually getting
really comfortable now like I can't even
feel them if from the brand Desio
okay now it's time for the fun part
let's go in up with this color right
here that's in the shade terracotta on
our burnt terracotta and I'm just gonna
keep this really close to my crease oh
yes that is sorry pigmented oh it's
going on like butter then I'll go back
in with that first transition shade and
blend around the edges okay so next I'm
gonna go ahead and carve out my whole
crease I haven't done a cut crease in so
long I always do just like half cut
creases and I'm over it so I'm gonna go
in with my touch check tape concealer as
per usual and this one's in the shade
light sensor I just put a little bit of
that on the back of my hand and then I'm
gonna go in with this little tiny shader
brush this has glitter in it
no and I'm just gonna cut it this is the
part that takes me the longest next step
I'm gonna go in with this blue color I'm
so excited for this so I'm gonna go in
with a flat shader brush and I'm just
gonna pack on oh oh my god that is so
amazing Wow
we have to blow on it now I'm gonna go
in with a black eyeliner and I'm just
gonna line up my lash line so when I put
my lashes on top you can't see what's
going on I've got my little mirror I'm
just doing this now so I don't figure it
out later because I know I'll forget it
and then for mascara I'm going in with
this Smashbox hyper lash mascara I'm
just going to coat my top lashes I'm
just gonna make them nice and black so
when I put the falsies on you can't see
the difference between the real and fake
and then to prime my face I'm taking
these still out or one step' prime this
one says it prep smooths and nourishes
the skin so that's amazing because my
skin is so dry at the moment I'm just
gonna take a one pump and work this end
of my skin
oh I just put a hydrating mask on my
face and it feels so good oh my gosh I
haven't used this one in so long this is
the RCM a color process foundation I
have the shade too so I'm just gonna see
if this matches my neck because I just
put some fresh baked Han on oh it's a
bit lighter
I mean I always go too dark so maybe I
should just like her to light because
like I think they never get the right
shade this fake ten is definitely not a
foundation color but I think that looks
pretty good I am it so excited to cover
these bad boys like are you kidding me
ready Oh
see ya this has a really nice coverage
every time I'm watching makeup tutorials
I feel like the most satisfying part to
watch is the foundation go on I don't
know if that's the same as you guys but
like when I'm watching a video and
someone skips over their foundation I'm
like this the whole time for the
concealer I'm going to take the Bobbi
Brown instant full cover concealer in
the shade sand this one is so good it's
super thick so you've really got to
scoop it out of here oh there we go
and then just set that down I'm going in
with my hace ma the original Nora color
powder sore I'm just gonna put a bit in
the back of the lid let's get so messy I
don't have a marriage to look up to yeah
next up I'm gonna go in with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte powder this one's
in the shade at 500 this should darken
up my foundation a tiny bit oh oh wow
do you like to go back now oh my god now
it's gonna be blotchy it's taking off my
foundation oh my god this is legit
that is a slime not even kidding this is
like around my whole makeup this is
sorry bad all my foundation has come off
right underneath where I set my face
with the RCM a I'm never using that
again anyways let's just deal with what
we have right now sir
the next color I'm taking is the crease
color and I'm gonna take this on my
lower lash line from a tikona all the
way to inner corner if you have blue
eyes to really make the blue stand out
before we move on to your finishing your
lashes I'm just gonna pick up this color
right here and use that to highlight my
inner corners this one has like chunky
glitter in it so I think this will be
perfect
pigment too these are usually I always
have to wet my brushes with fix+ a nap
today Junior don't know what that was
sorry okay I'm gonna go ahead and put
some falsies on and I'll be right back
no it's time to darken up my face
because it's super pale right now a
little bit yellow what can you do okay
so I'm gonna go in with the Mac Studio
care blend pressed powder in the shade
at dark and this one is just gonna match
up my face neck so I'm just gonna put
this what's nice this one's um Matt I
think it's just like a powder but in a
dog shade to be honest I don't think
it's even a bronzer and then over to
help I'm taking the betty lou manizer by
the balm this one's more of a shimmery
bronze up oh god she's stuck looks like
that
Oh something sounds loose in there I'm
just gonna put this over the top for a
little bit of a glow I'm gonna go in
with the matching blush by the bar this
one is the cindy lou manizer obviously I
want a really glowy face today so I'm
just gonna put this on the apples of my
cheeks and blend back because there is
so much shimmer on the cheeks you
obviously can just get out on a
highlighter but Lee
yeah sorry on subcostal minutes well
highlighter as well oh my gosh I haven't
used this in so long this is the Ofra
ugu highlighter this was my favorite
highlighters
so long so let's see how it is I forget
I mean I remember that it's amazing as
you can see and the brush I'm using is
from Sigma this one is the f-35 my gosh
I haven't used to signal brushes and
ages they still thing do they still have
a website girl to tie the eyes and the
lips in I'm gonna go in with this a more
feed liquid lipstick in this shade
lovely this is like an orange II I mean
like I don't even know what call you'd
call this bonus I'll just put it on the
lips I might hurt my lips with a little
bit of foundation it's just cuz I super
pink
I'm scared this is gonna look horrible
oh wow that smells exactly like the
Kylie cosmetics funds
okay maybe it's hot chef nude in the
middle just a little bit looking like
really crazy right now so I'm just gonna
take beauty beauty in the shade
girlfriend I love this and I'm just
gonna tap it on with my finger last step
is to go in with some settings right so
this one is the glam glow gallery set
off let's do this okay
so here we have the finished makeup look
I love how it looks I just like I'm so
distracted by how dark my hair is
usually my hair is super blond like this
but all of my roots have grown out
somewhat oh go on
I love the blue eyeshadow that's amazing
and I love how the orange blended in the
crease as well loving the blue color I
think this is really cool something a
little bit different and yeah I'm really
impressed with how everything went even
though we had a little midlife crisis
with the powder but I managed to fix it
up with the benefit hello flawless
powder I just put this all over my face
and it kind of just evened everything
out so I'm really happy about that so
