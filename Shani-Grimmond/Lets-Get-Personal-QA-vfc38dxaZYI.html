in today's video I'm just going to be
doing a little catch-up and a Q&amp;amp;A as
well because I haven't done one of these
kind of like to sit down be yours in a
really long time so let's do this hum
let's do this chicken how many people
were too impressed with me calling you
chicken so I guess we're just going to
stick to guys hello guys hello my love's
I like that one anyways so the first
thing I want to say is thank you so much
for 1 million subscribers hi ah what the
 that is a lot of people and I just
it just blows my mind to think that many
people have recognized me and wanted to
come back and keep seeing me so thank
you so much really means the world to me
I don't know what are we doing without
this passion hobby job like it is the
best thing that's ever happened to me so
I did have a 1 million party my family
and friends surprised me and I had no
idea it was so much fun I know it's a
bit delayed this thank you but I have
been doing like makeup tutorials and
stuff and I was waiting to just do like
a sit-down kind of video until I could
thank you guys but I don't even know
what to say like you guys are the reason
that I'm here today and the reason that
I'm so incredibly happy with my life and
I just can't thank you enough to thank
you thank you thank you I love you guys
so much and my family and friends for
supporting me throughout this whole
journey of YouTube I was just sitting
here thinking before like when I first
started youtube I was like literally
still in school and I didn't even know
like what could come out of it I didn't
think that this would ever happen in my
life I just did it because I love doing
makeup and I was like hey maybe I can
teach a few people even though I was
shocking when I first started doing
YouTube sucked so bad looking back at my
old makeup tutorials I'm like what are
you doing shiny and you know what we all
did this together as a team as a family
and yeah I love you and other thing that
I want to talk to you guys about is
something that happened to me while I
was clubbing the other day so I went to
this event on a Sunday right and this
happens to me all the time and I just
want to share with you guys because I'm
sure it happens too as well and it
pissed me off so bad and that is when
guys walk past you they slap your bum or
for exam
when I was taking a snapshot video it's
just like yeah like singing like drug
Johnny singing to my son chat having the
best time of my life and then all of a
sudden this guy randomly just comes up
to me and kisses me on the cheek and I'm
like what makes you think that a girl
that you don't even know wants you to
touch them please tell me the amount of
times where I've walked past a guy and
I've just slapped me on the ass I've
turned around to see who it wasn't I
can't see them because they've ran away
because they know it's wrong Bulow's my
mind and then the amount of times where
I turn around and the guys just like
kind of looking at me I'm like yeah can
you not just one of those things
that I wanted to get off my chest and
hopefully if you're a guy watching this
video and you do that hopefully you
start because it is so disrespectful and
it makes me feel sick and I will vomit
on you I have you know a clocked a few
guys in the leg with my heels when
they've done that because I honestly
makes me so furious that I can't help
but like this and that's what to get
honey the first question is how do you
feel about influence who's content
completely revolves around sponsorships
like understandably this is a career and
money has to be made but do you feel
like it creates a lack of trust between
the influencer and the viewer well I
guess it really depends on who you're
talking about
because for me I think never promote
something that I don't genuinely use and
a lot of people can get caught up in
like oh my god they're going to give me
$10,000 giving me $20,000 I'm just going
to responsible because that's a lot of
money and I want to buy this car I want
to buy this house I want to buy this bag
so they just go ahead and do it because
they feel like they can get to their
goal quicker and they forget sometimes
about what's most important and that's
obviously the trust between the
influence that ends viewer and that's
something that I would never jeopardize
because it's so obvious if someone's
like promoting some stupid that you
know they don't actually use because you
know that person you know are YouTube
that you're watching and their interests
because you've been probably watching
them for a while
I personally watch YouTube so incredibly
much and if I see a sponsorship that
seems I'm genuine or just seems like
they wouldn't even use it I just click
over video because I just don't want to
listen to you not I mean and
I'm sure you guys don't want to either
that's why I and just like if I want to
do a sponsorship I use the products I
love the product and I think it's good
idea to share
or the world oh my god I honestly get
this question all the time and that is
what happened to Luna I have told you
guys a few times on snapchat and stuff
but for you guys that don't know me
night is my dog that I got probably like
six months ago or something and when I
got hurt the person that I was buying
her off said oh whatever toy and she's
going to be so small because I was like
I live in an apartment it isn't the
biggest apartment ever and I don't want
a dog to be suffering because I don't
have backyard okay like I can take from
forg but I don't have a backyard so you
know where this leads to
five months later Luna is humongous
she's getting really irritated being in
this small little apartment and I'm like
 what am I supposed to do Luna and I
had the strongest connection over I'm so
obsessed with her like I get so upset if
I don't see her for at least a week and
I definitely do see her once a week now
but I'm we were just like inseparable so
I was like what am I gonna do I was
crying I'm like mom can you please look
after her until I move out and get a
backyard
and she's like okay whatever at the time
mom didn't have a very like strong
connection with Luna but she just took
her under her wing and now mom and Luna
are literally like this mama Luna are
now closer than me and Luna
actually I don't know that's debatable
but they love each other so much mom has
a backyard Luna runs around every single
day she loved her life she can honestly
tell how happy she is I did say to mom
but I won't learn about clique as soon
as I moved but I don't know if I can do
that to Mum or Luna I don't want to like
like move her around and stuff so I
guess we'll see what happens when I do
move and if I do get like a big enough
back yard for her has been dealing a
lovely cello
it just was like this size and I just
was thinking of Lena's happiness like
what's more important if I'm happy with
Luna because I'm so obsessed with it or
a fluid is happy with her life and I can
still see him once a week this one pinky
the next question is tell us about your
siblings and family i don't feel like i
talked about my siblings much on youtube
i like to keep that private just because
they're like my world and I don't want
them to ever get involved in like this
whole social anything because I feel
like there should be like a line of like
privacy and like YouTube in social media
and putting yourself out there and stuff
but a little background I have three
brothers one sister my brother is 9 my
sister is 10 me I don't even know
that's not right one brothers 23 one
brothers a and one sisters 10 so growing
up I wouldn't say that my older brother
and I would like the closest where you
started getting close when I like just
came out of high school and I thought
just like maturing a little bit and like
oh my god it feels like my brother
actually likes me this is the best thing
ever because like he would always speak
I mean school like any normal brother
would I mean I'm not saying that he was
a believe that we just didn't get along
very well we did sometimes I could play
with toys and when a little but
like when we got older I into my teenage
years we just wanted the best of friends
but now a super close and we talk about
everything and you always come to you
for advice yeah and then when it comes
to my little brother and sister I see
them once a week I love him so much I
mean my sister specially are like
literally so quiet we I like the same
people I swear like she's so stubborn
like me she's just shy like me I love
her I'm trying to bring her out of our
shell though because she's like really
shy like on another level when I was
growing up I was really shy as well and
I was saying that I only just started
coming out of that bubble when I left
high school I was really scary when it
comes to my mom and dad we are all so
close they had me when Noah 20 so
they're really young parents and I just
tell them everything I love them so much
I see them all the time if I go two
weeks without seeing them I feel for and
say they'd never seen me like talk about
how much I love them so this would be so
awkward if they saw this video because I
decide like showing my emotions I don't
like telling people I love them I know
it's so bad but I'm just like the least
most affectionate person you've ever
ever ever ever ever met with her and
actually broke up when I was like four
five or something and adds up
Pistor bed because I obviously wasn't a
happy with anything I wasn't happy with
my parents breaking up so then they got
back together and I was completely filed
like an annual child and then they
actually got a divorce well I've
actually not eligible but they broke up
when I was in grade 11 for goodness
still separated but they're still really
close friends and when I was in grade 11
and when they broke up I was like oh my
god this is the worst thing that's ever
happened to me I can't believe it
because at the time I didn't realize
that your parents separating would
actually in the long run make them
happier because if that's what they both
want they're going to be happier which
is going to make you happier
what you should be focusing on you
shouldn't be like why don't you stay
together because of me
that's not how it works you're gonna
make sure your parents happy as well the
next question is kind of a hard one to
and so it is how have you dealt with
your social anxiety being an online
speaker well I know I feel like my
social anxiety has kind of like became
worse ever since I've done social media
other than at the same time there are
some aspects where it has definitely
gotten better sorry for example my
social anxiety goes something like this
so it was my friend's birthday like two
days ago we're pretty close we only just
started hanging out like six months ago
so we're not like besties but we are
pretty close and she was having like 10
of her friends come to this dinner as
well and I'm like oh my god I concur I
don't know any of the other people I
feel like I'm going to be left out like
I just get really socially anxious when
I'm with a big group of people that I
don't know so I didn't go because I'm
like I'm going to be so anxious
this whole time because I don't know
anyone even all right if I did go I know
that all her friends would be so nice I
know I get along with them and I know
that I would make conversation with them
like it's so weird because sometimes I'm
like that and then sometimes I'm a
complete extrovert yeah that's the way
and I'm like loud and annoying and funny
and whatever but then sometimes I'm just
like I don't know it's really weird and
then another time I went to a meet-up
which is my surfing outlet of the head
and that was at the Gold Coast rat and I
didn't really know what to expect
because I've never had a meet-up before
and then I get there and there's like
two hundred and fifty girls and a few
guys waiting for me and I was like oh
okay sorry it was like the best thing
that's ever happened to me because I'm
like all these people want to meet
me and then on the other hand I'm like
oh this is so scary like I don't really
anyone down like I'm doing this bummer
so ah
so I did get really anxious there and a
lot of people like shiny like you look
so nervous what's wrong and I'm like oh
this is just obviously scary
because there's so many people sitting
around me to meet me and I just don't
know what to do like oh don't get me
wrong I love meeting you guys want to
play the best feeling ever like when I
left oh so happy I'm like so glad I did
that it was such a fun experience I like
just to see so many people I was just
like speaking of meeting you guys I just
want to say I met this girl the other
day at
movies right and lining up to go get our
popcorn and food and I was weird like
four of my friends and she was like four
of her friends as well and while lining
out right she was at the front of line
Alf at the back of the line and the line
kind of like wrapped around so she saw
me like right next to her like at the
back the line
okay can we get a friend I was like you
know cool it's like what maybe you're
going to stay and she's like split and I
was going to go soon that's so cool and
she's I can get photo I was like yeah
sure and then I got afraid with her and
then I was like okay bye because people
in the line were like me the hairy yeah
because she was holding up the whole
line to get a photo with me and I was
like oh my god this is so uncomfortable
that everyone's waiting for me because
I'm getting a photo like I feel so bad
so anyway I said bye to her and I went
do my own thing and she was like next up
in mine anyway she posts on an advice
page and she's like I met sharing today
I feel like she didn't want anything to
do with me I feel like she just wasn't
interested in our conversation and I was
like I are you serious and then like she
attached a photo of me underneath of us
smile and getting a photo looking all
happy I'm like how was I not nice to you
I tried to make conversation with you I
asked what we're seeing I got a photo
with you I was literally so nice to her
like I do understand like I don't
understand I don't know people just like
to start drama I guess what can you do
those are funny to see all these videos
about people like a meeting rude
youtubers like I have met a lot of
review tubers but like I've also met a
lot of rude people in my life and that's
the same thing and they're going to make
a video about meeting rude people oh
yeah disco at the cafe she obviously was
having a bad day so she shows me a bit
to me like everyone has bad days
come on I don't know I just feel like
it's unfair because you choose are the
exact same as everyone else
they all have bad days we all have bad
days you have bad days the next question
is actually an interesting one would you
ever become gay if I ever has a desire
of being with a woman then of course but
right now I definitely feel 100%
straight and I don't think I'll ever be
bi or gay I am not attracted to that
anyway some there's almost thing that I
want to run over because I know you guys
care so much about my life I'm kidding
this is so not interesting but I went to
the doctor's the other day and I
actually have to take a deficiency
tablets now every night the next
next month or something like that which
is so annoying but now I understand I
get why I was so lazy for the past six
months because I had nerve energy also
why do I just feel like a all the
time
so now that I'm trying to take these
iron deficiency tablets I'm trying to
feel a lot better I have more energy and
I started up the gym I'm so proud of
myself but yeah I've been going to the
gym every day whatever a weekday so
yesterday because I was literally so
dead from the day before
but if Jim is something that you guys
have sort of back to wean then I'll
definitely recommend it it's so much fun
just I'm giving you that extra okay I'm
giving me that extra push because after
you go to the gym or workout at home
whatever you feel so much better and
happier and more motivated about
everything so trust me on that if you've
been thinking about trying to exercise
go to it honey you got this
start right now so it's on five minutes
throw in an hour there's something two
days it's at right now so anyways I love
you go so much and I will see you in my
next video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and get to see your thumbs up
and I'll talk to you guys soon na
