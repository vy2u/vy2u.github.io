my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a Q&amp;amp;A all about my lip injections I've
got them done a few weeks ago so I
thought it was about time so sit down
and just add some questions so let's go
ahead and get started just quickly I
want to show you guys what my lips
actually look like because they're kind
of far away from each other so this is a
little close-up yay I never thought that
I would be sitting here talking about my
lips and lip injections because I want
to never thought I would end up getting
them because I was so scared
I'm so horrified of needles but I can
happily say that it was completely worth
it and I actually love my lips now which
is something I never thought I would say
either the first question is did you do
it to fit into the Kylie Jenner trend
and I actually think that's a really
good question because I feel like ever
since Kylie but her lips done a lot of
other people have done it as well but I
would never change the look of my face
or body or anything just to fit into a
trend I don't necessarily follow trends
I just do what makes me happy I know
that so cliche to say but basically one
side of my lip was really big and the
other side was really thin so I just
wanted to even it out give them a
natural plump and make them look
naturally juicy and that's exactly what
I got okay so let's just state the
obvious with a question that everyone is
asking and that is did it hurt in your
lip injections mmm-hmm okay well my
story is kind of different to everyone
else's um I looked up a lot of people's
q and A's and like little Jackson
stories and stuff on YouTube just so I
knew if it hurt or not because I really
am a wimp and I just can't stand needles
I can't stand pain so looking them up
for ages for months and months and
everyone was saying oh doesn't really
hurt like on a scale one to ten it's
like a - hmm different story for me he
sells going in like yes this isn't going
to hurt first of all I got the dental
block so that is four needles in the gum
so two at the top into down the bottom
and everyone said that it didn't hurt
getting mental blocks but god bless they
hurt more than the other twenty needles
around my lips so basically I got the
mean and the first needle I was like oh
my god oh my god I'm gonna fight I'm
gonna fight oh I feel sick how is being
a big drama queen because I just felt
horrible I think it was because I was
really nervous though so well the lady
did is she just like pulled me back on
the chair and I just was like leaning
basically like this and after like ten
or seven minutes I was better and I had
some bullies and stuff to bring my sugar
levels up and then I sat back up got in
for the second one and I was it oh god I
feel sick again
went back down literally happened every
single time for that dental luck it was
horrible but before you guys get scared
or anything it only lasts for like 20
seconds I'm not condoning lip injections
or anything but if you guys are thinking
of getting them it doesn't last that
long so it's fine when the numbing fluid
really kicked in I was like okay I'm
ready
and when I was trying to look I was like
you really can't move you miss at all
and then she started putting the needles
in for the actual lip injection and it's
basically just like sugar going into
your lip it's nothing crazy and there's
probably about a 30 or 20 more needles
into my lip and by the end of it I was
just like hmm like I literally couldn't
feel a thing but at the start you can
really feel the pricks going into your
lips it felt like kind of little ant
bites it wasn't as bad as a dental block
do like the final result or do you want
to get them bigger I am obsessed with
the final result right now I got one
meal in my lips and the lady that was
doing them said what's natural and two
meals is like a noticeably lip injection
job so I'm really happy with the amount
that I got and how she did it
I will leave had a health tumbler and
where I got the dumb stuff just in case
you guys are interested but she just did
an amazing job and made him look so
natural so no I don't want them bigger
um when I first got them done they spike
was so swollen and also oh my god my
lips and I couldn't leave the house like
three days because that's how long the
swollen mist kind of lasts for my
English is just great should I but it
has been as I said about two weeks and
they're finally feeling normal they feel
super soft like normal lips somehow nice
and the questions does it feel different
to kiss and it doesn't they just feel
squishy and normal and natural roughly
how much did it cost to get your lip
injections so the place that I went had
like a deal so I think it was like $400
for the lip injections but most places
are quite similar they do vary up to
like a thousand dollars to get lips on
it can cost a lot of money depending on
where you go um yeah it lasts about six
months and you're going to go for your
top up I think in some people it can
last longer or a little bit less so I
guess we'll have to see how long my last
fall but I definitely will be going back
and I definitely am dreading the day
that I have to get more deals my
face oh the next question is what did
Jonathan think of your lips when you
first got them done so I remember I was
talking to him about it I was like like
a sketch media whether it's done like
are you gonna like them and he was like
all that I really not to expect and he
didn't really have too much of an
opinion because he was kind of just like
busy and you didn't really know what was
gonna what they were going to look like
and I got home and I was like hey and
this is one oh really swollen and he's
like holy I was like don't worry
though go down a few days but now I
think actually I'm really asked him but
I'm pretty sure he likes it now because
you can't even really tell that much of
a difference I just look more plump so
you better bloody laughing the next
question I kind of have touched base on
but I do wanna bring it up again just
because I do find it really important it
is how did you pick your doctor and sort
out which ones you trusted and which
ones you didn't so what I did is I went
on Instagram and just saw like before
and afters of this place just because I
wanted to see what the final result look
like on other people so I decided to go
to the Australian Skin Clinic in Indra
Pilli and the specific lady in there um
so called specializes in like natural
looking lips so as I said before I'll
leave her name down below but I do think
it's very important to do the research
because you don't want to look looking
wonky because they do last about six
months so for example the place where
Kirk when his lips done before where he
gets them done now I was really
confusing they made his top lip bigger
than his bottom lip which kind of makes
it all look unproportioned and unnatural
and he hated it so yeah it just gotta be
really careful we go the next question
is are they what you expected them to be
like I honestly didn't think they would
look this good um the lady made my
Cupid's bow a little bit bigger so I
find that applying lipstick my lips look
a bit nicer with that beautiful Cooper's
boy but yeah I just didn't think they
look this natural I thought they'd look
a tiny bit fake but no but I would say
that they did exceed my expectations of
what they were going to look like I'm so
happy
I should really shut up about how much I
loved and now people gonna be like
hereís so obsessed with them well yeah
is it strange to drink or eat or is
there no difference the only thing that
was weird was like putting my lips on a
cup and bring luck oh my gosh oh so much
bigger and then I'd kind of like dribble
down the side of my face it was just
like getting used to the size difference
at the start that was a little bit
difficult and I'm also finding it this
is really weird but I'm also finding a
little bit harder to speak because now
this they are a lot bigger and I don't
know I always find myself like for
example over the past like a few days I
have noticed myself really stuffing up
my words because my lips get stuck
together so I'm somewhat used to them
yet but I'll get there what made you
want lip injections I would just say the
main reason is I'd always find myself
overdrawn my lips so incredibly much and
you can see the big over jaw line and it
just didn't look natural at all so I was
like hey why not just pop a little bit
of sugar your lips to make them bigger
there was no one specifically that mean
you want to get my lips standard but I
would say that they encouraged me to get
them done like I was watching Amanda in
seg and her lips just look super natural
I did want them down before I watched
all these peoples videos but they kind
of work made me feel like it's not going
to hurt too much so just just do it if
that's what you want just do it the next
question is how long have you wanted to
get them done um probably about like
four or so months but the month before I
got them done I was thinking about them
every single day and I was like do I
really need this I really want this is
going to make me happy if it's what I
want and I literally will just obsess
over the thought and I was like you know
what after that month of thinking about
it so much I was like I'm just going to
go get it
someone said they are ugly xoxo
if you guys didn't see my lips before
you would not be able to notice the
difference they're not noticeably big
and swollen looking but obviously
everyone has their own opinion on lip
injections because you are at the end of
the day changing what your natural face
and features look like how did your
friends and family react when you told
them you wanted it lip injections
everyone was pretty fine about it my dad
wasn't too fond of me getting my lips
done but now that he's seen him he
doesn't really mind too much he can
nurse
different obviously he's been raising me
for what 18 years and he can really pick
up on the size difference my mum has had
her lips done before and she wants me to
buy her thumb for Christmas and Mama's
gonna buy some lips no I said I'd book
her in for her Christmas friends who I
was so she was very supportive of that
um yeah everyone was fine I didn't
really care because not their lips it's
mine could you ever have yourself with
your natural lips again when I look back
at old photos I really just don't like
what my lips look like before now that I
have a bigger more plump natural looking
lips I just I just couldn't see myself
going back to that and I just don't want
to the last question is a going to get
anything else done I know a lot of
people say once you get your lips done
for the first time you're going to be
addicted you get everything else done
but I'm happy with just my lips I like
everything else on my face and I'm not
going to get anything else done first
there you go rude enough to freak out
because I know everyone's aunty
change your face and she's breathing
holy crap look how wet my hands are only
turned up here some works but anyways
there we have my lip injections qat I
hope you guys found this video helpful
or at least interesting as I said I'm
not condoning lip injections if you do
want to get down there go for it it's
amazing just make sure you find the
right doctor so yeah I hope you guys
liked this video and I'll see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
