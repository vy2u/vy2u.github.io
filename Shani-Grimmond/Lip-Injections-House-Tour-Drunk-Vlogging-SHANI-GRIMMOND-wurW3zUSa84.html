be doing a vlog I just have a few things
to do and I thought it would be fun if
you could come along with me so I'm
thinking about going to the Gold Coast
today and I also have a lot of cleaning
and boring stuff to do so just a basic
day in my life and yes I got my lips
done
they are extremely extremely swollen at
the moment so they're not going to be
this big in a few days don't worry
people like freaking out my goal would
you do your lips don't worry this one
will go down I would never make my lips
look fake except right now there's
nothing I can do about it um so yeah I'm
going to make some brekkie because well
I'm hungry so I've decided to have some
weet-bix for breakfast and some green
juice oh my god actually poured so much
sugar into my weet-bix and it tastes
sort of gross which is weird because I
love sugar
so I got this candle the other day it
smells amazing it's the glasshouse
and it is triple Center double whipped
and what is it vanilla and caramel it
smells so good and I'm just watching
aiming the seder there's the first
impression and yeah that's my morning
so when I went to get my lips down the
other day I also got my skin looked at
because it's really dry and I have left
acne scarring and stuff so I now have a
new skincare routine so I will do that
later like a video on it if it all goes
to plan so yeah I use the brand skin
stitute so I went to laser clinics
Australia at in Tripoli or move on so
amazing so this is the products that
they use I have so many things and then
I have stuff in here as well that I'm
using but yeah I thought I would let you
guys know I'm also about to apply some
ten I have heats up here to choose from
I'm going to apply my favorite tanner
and I wanna do a video on that so you
guys will see you what I'm going to use
okay so this is the before of my tan and
this is after so the car looks a little
bit weird now because I'm in weird
lighting but I have to clean my makeup
room this is going to take a while oh my
god I finally finished cleaning I've
been doing it for hours so all morning
it is now about one o'clock
um so I'm just going to show you my
pretty place so I've got the same
furniture as last time have some plants
and I finally put my rug down I have to
get rid of all of that needs to go and I
love the kitchen it's so pretty yeah
Christmas spirit and then my room needs
a lot of work I need my bed so I put on
and need some stuff on the bedside
tables blah blah um yeah my closet is
literally so jam-packed full and my
shoes don't have enough space so they're
piled on top of each other I've got to
buy a chair for my little study Nokia
and some nice little things to put
around there and my kitchens nice and
clean oh my god I just cool is a kitchen
that's cute my bathroom and then
in here
oh my God look at the after you can
actually see the floor this is in thing
we can cute bitty looks so while my food
is cooking I'm just going to do some
online shopping because it is Black
Friday and there's like massive sales on
at the moment so I'm going to shop on
some American websites using this like
shipping service it's called comm
gateway Black Friday sale oh my god I
love sales so yesterday I went shopping
on Sephora Australia and there was like
a 20% discount today so like I missed
that which sucks let's do hate when that
happens
okay anyway so yeah I'm using con
gateway it's just like a shipping
service you can get like American things
shipped through this address that they
provide you and then they ship it to you
and you just pay like the shipping fee
so that's what I'm going to do because I
feel like saving some money and I also
feel like getting more makeup I think
I'm going to get some referral liquid
lipsticks um because they're having a
50% off sale and I really like them when
I had them last time so yeah I'm going
to do that but yeah I will leave the con
gateway link in the description below
because it's honestly the best shipping
service that I've used I do like a
massive haul using that service awhile
ago and I was very happy with it so I'm
gonna do it again and now I'm gonna have
some food ok so I finally finished
packing this bag is literally about to
pop but just quickly I want to show you
my new shoes these are from I think it
was a general pants or universal way
that the mixed up but it's super cute
and they just let go with everything
oh you bet my nails Oh God oh my god I
look so dark right now but I'm just at
Jonathan's work because I have to pick
up the house keys to my old house
because it got broken into again so I
have to see if
um they've done any damage so annoying
but that happened like a few days ago so
I'm going to go check and then go hang
out with mommy my tan is looking so good

Coast right now and all of a sudden
