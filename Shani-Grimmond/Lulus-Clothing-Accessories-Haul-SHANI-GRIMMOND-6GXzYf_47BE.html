my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a clothing haul I also have a few other
bits and bobs like bags and shoes and
stuff like that I'm super excited
because this is a collaboration with at
Lulu's calm they have some amazing
products and I can't wait to share them
with you so I'll leave everything that
I'm going to share with you guys in this
video in the description below if you
are interested in any of it so let's go
ahead and jump straight into this bindi
is sitting on my pile of clothes out of
the whole floor she's got a sin on my
clothes the first thing that I have is a
bodysuit I have a really weird obsession
with body suits I love them so much that
is so comfortable and you can just check
on a pair of high-waisted jeans or
anything like that it looks amazing so I
decided to pick up like the sandy pinky
Moby color just because I have so many
white and black clothes and I just need
to step out of my comfort zone even if
it's a little bit I wore this yesterday
and it was super comfortable so it has
the buttons up the back and then the
little Clips down the bottom so I
usually find it really hard to find body
suits that actually fit me because I
have a super long torso so I always tend
to get a massive wedgie but this one is
amazing and absolute that it I feel like
I want to wear that too much the next
thing that we have here is a pair of
bikini so again I wanted to try
something that was a little bit of a
different color I absolutely love this
style this it has criss cross at the
back and then you can readjust the
little triangles right here if you want
more boobie or you want to put your baby
away so I'm a size 10 or medium in
bikinis I don't know why everything else
is small but these are medium so this is
what the bottoms looks like these ones
have little cutouts on the side and they
are really cheeky as well I am so
excited to wear these ones even though
it is the first day of winter here in
Australia I had together- a to the next
thing that I have is this little black
basic dress so this one goes to my knees
I don't like wearing anything that is
above my knees I feel like I've already
done that like when I was 12 13 I like
to have my butt cheeks out you know
there's like high-waisted shorts and
they're like completely out but yeah I
like to keep all of that tucked away but
it's still showing a bit of back skin as
well so I think it looks really nice it
has a lots of Chris courses and I just
love
dresses I finally picked up a skirt that
I can wear in the daytime so this one is
a white pencil denim skirt I also want
to get the blue one it really bad I
think that would look amazing I think
this one especially will look really
good with a nude crop so I have lots of
skirt but only clubbing skirt so I've
never worn a skirt in a day time that's
why it took me so long to pick up
something like this but I tried it on
and I absolutely loved it you know how I
said I'm obsessed with body suits well I
had to pick up a few in the same style
but different colors because I wear them
that much so this is what the next one
looks like it has longer sleeves which I
really love because I have really broad
shoulders thanks to my mom so anything
that goes that past the shoulder kind of
just like tucks it in a little bit it
has a little choker well I would call it
a joke about a little piece of fabric
that goes around the neck to keep it
nice and classy and of course I have to
get the exact same one in the gray shade
there's just so many different ways you
can dress up body suits let's start with
the white skirt that I just showed you
you can do what how I said jeans
everything is just high-waisted in my
mind I love it oh yes stepping out of my
comfort zone a little bit so I got this
denim top it is a long sleeve top but
the reason I got this is to tie it
around my waist so I can kind of be a
bit like Pier me a little bit country
but still looking really sleek I don't
think I would wear it as like a normal
table I definitely just wanted to as an
accessory around my waist so I'm so
excited to dress this up I don't really
know how what I'm going to wear it with
but I'm gonna make it work and you're
probably gonna see it my Instagram the
last piece of a clothing that I have
here is a white basic crop
I love sperry straps so much they're
super elastic here and stretchy and then
we have a little flap at the back so it
is kind of backless but you can
definitely get away with wearing a bra
still so about a week ago I was supposed
to go to a festival but turns out I was
six so I couldn't even wear my new arm
jewelry it has little leaves hanging off
and I just think it's so for her it's a
beautiful bronze shade and you can
stretch it to your arm size so I'm gonna
wear it when I go to a festival up here
although I don't know when the next
festivals going to be because I couldn't
get my tickets to slend up cuz you
imagine we had a festival just like
shimmy shimmy shimmy shimmy shimmy
I also picked up another statement piece
for a festival that I didn't get take it
- but I still am definitely going to
make this work so when you have like
high-waisted jeans or skirts or anything
like that you can just put this around
your waist can't wait to try this out so
cute I have to pick up another body
chain this is what it looks like here I
actually forget how you're supposed to
wear this but when I start on the side I
was like oh my god that is so cute I'm
pretty sure you wrap it around your
belly so I think it'll be perfect for
like when you're taking photos and
bikini is just to add a little bit more
pizzazz 'el and this definitely is more
of my style than the other ones because
I'd like they're more festively that's
definitely why I got them and this one
is more for like everyday the next thing
that I picked up is this bag so I'm
going to be using this as a clutch for
clubbing I think it is so nice I love
the Rolly up thing because then it's
like less likely for you to you know get
really drunk and lose your stuff you can
wear this as a bag because it has a
strap around here as well but I just
love basic black neutral white nude
anything this is gorgeous
I also picked up another clutch this is
what it looks like here so it is white
with gold studs all over it it
definitely has a lot going on the reason
I got this is because when I wear basics
or something like maybe a white basic
dress when I go clubbing I thought this
would be perfect to really dress it up
so again you can use this as a bag with
these clips here you have a zipper and
plenty room to put lots of stuff in okay
so these are essentials in my opinion if
you guys don't have these you absolutely
need to get them so the first one we
have here our nipple covers they look
like this and all you do is you stick
them over your nipples when you're
wearing a backless dress or if you just
are one wear a bra and you cannot see
your nipples and you can reuse them if
you stick the plastic on the back as
well so keep those safe don't get too
drunk because then you won't remember to
take them off and you're probably go to
bed with them on like have done quite a
lot of times I also got another style of
nipple covers and I'm pretty sure these
ones are more focused on not being able
to see your harder nipples so you
basically just pop these little flowers
or the circle material over your nip
next we have a to make up products so
the first one is the well I mean it's
not really make up product but it's what
you clean your Beautyblender with this
is honestly the easiest way to clean
your Beautyblender it has just like a
little piece of soap in there and you
just rub it around and squeeze your
Beauty Blender and all the foundation
comes out straight away
I've used up a whole one of these before
and I absolutely love it
it is the easiest way to get stains out
of Butte Linda now I have a clean pink
Beauty Blender I thought I had to buy
more but I'm like no it's better to save
money and get this instead so the next
thing that I have is the NYX angel veal
skin perfecting primer I've just heard
so many people talk about this and for
me in Australia it is kind of hard for
me to get a hold of NYX products so I
thought well as on the site I may as
well get this since I've heard so many
amazing things of that last but not
least I picked up a pair of it classic
black pumps I love these so much because
the length of them is perfect for
clubbing I don't want anything higher
than this otherwise I've got a longer
way to fall down and I don't feel like
doing that I love little strappy things
that go around the ankle as well because
it adds a little bit of something to the
shoe but it isn't over the top and
wrapping all the way around the leg so
I'm pretty sure this is the suede
material and I how it's like a little
bit fluffy just super comfortable and I
cannot wait to rock these so there we
have my Lulu's haul I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video I definitely am
gonna have a lot more hauls coming up
because I mean I'm just being honest up
in frenzy and I can't stop myself so I
saw I may still share it with you guys
