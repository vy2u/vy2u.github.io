freakin love getting surprise packages
um so you know how I said I was going
out to dinner with Chloe
it was more like lunch it was like 2
o'clock so don't mind me um yeah so I'm
just going to go home and I want to give
you guys a massive update on like my
formal and like me moving out and all
that because I have so much to tell you
um and yeah so I'll see you when I get
home okay so let's start with my formal
you guys that's follow me on Instagram
stuff you would have seen all the photos
from formal I had so much fun it was an
amazing time like hanging out with all
my school friends and stuff it was it
was just really really fun um and I did
take Sean my ex boyfriend for those who
don't know to my fall and we were dating
for two years and we broke up like a
month before formal and I still wanted
him to come because like I didn't want
to take someone that didn't really mean
anything to me like I think that's a bit
silly because you know I look back at
these photos like when you're older and
I want to look back and be happy with
who I went with and stuff I don't know
it's hard to explain but I'm I am glad
that I told him it was a little bit
awkward just because like we really did
just break up um but we're still friends
it's just really kind of weird so now I
want to talk about my tumblr so
a lot of people have been messaging me
lately and I like I always always always
I'm so open when I'm answering my
questions like people ask about sex boys
friends family problems school and I
literally answer everything I'm the most
honest person you'll probably ever know
and I've done that for years like I've
always been the most open person and I
think a lot of people are getting a
little bit weird weirded out about it
like I'm some followers aren't very open
obviously and they're like SHINee way to
open like why you telling us your whole
life story and I'm like well people are
asking and I want to be honest and like
help you guys out if you need advice
with my like things that have happened
to me I don't know if I'm making sense
right now but I've always been so open
and I don't want to change out just
because people are kind of know just
because I'm kind of getting more well
known kind of thing I don't know how to
put it but that's yeah I just wanted to
address that because yes I do put my
whole life out there but that's just me
um sorry if you don't like you know all
of them kind of questions and do not go
on to my tumblr because I literally
answer like the most craziest questions
you guys probably gone there now and
just do like girl that's really personal
yes and another thing that I want to
talk about is okay so like last week I
was having a really bad day of my friend
and I were fighting we had a little bit
of an argument and I got home and I was
just like so like I just didn't feel
well at all like I was just having
really crappy day and I got home and I
just had uploaded a video that day and
I've got like five messages in one go on
a video and it said Shaunie I was having
the worst day today and then I come home
to this video and honestly made me so
much more happier you make me you make
me more confident you make me laugh
avoir you guys have no no idea how much
that means to me like oh my god
just like all the support you guys give
me you guys have no idea how much it
means to me like with the breakup that I
went through a month ago was Shaun like
you guys were the ones that got me
through it I went on tumblr I was like
crying my eyeballs out and I want to
tumble and I was telling you guys how I
was feeling I was feeling horrible
really sad and you guys were there for
me the whole entire time so the least I
can do is be there for you sorry if you
want to send me messages or anything ask
me on tumblr Instagram or anything
because I'm always gonna be here for you
guys I love you so so so much you have
no idea oh I'm getting emotional so yeah
the next thing that I want to talk about
is for you guys that don't know I'm
going to be a full-time youtuber in
literally like a month so I'm going to
be uploading a lot so I was just
wondering if you guys want to uploading
schedule like if you want me to upload
on certain days certain times or
anything like that I personally don't
really want to do a schedule because I
don't want to feel like I have to upload
videos because I do get paid to make
youtube videos but I don't make them
because I get paid I make them because I
love interacting with you guys I love
helping you guys and just I don't know I
just love love love making YouTube
videos so if I was to make a schedule I
feel like I kind of have to make it on
this day at this time and I feel like
maybe I wouldn't be as happy in that
video or in in the videos that I have to
make you know what I mean like it's so
hard to explain but I don't want to do a
schedule but if you guys want me to then
I'll definitely consider it and see what
I can do I'm just so excited to be like
a full-time youtuber it sounds so silly
like hey shiny what's your job um oh
yeah I'm a full-time youtuber
it honestly does sound so silly but if
something that I love doing and there's
this quote that I still actually have a
damn tumblr and it says um hey wait I'm
gonna have to look for it it says okay I
found it it's on my tumblr it says
Mondays are fine you hate your job and
that is like the best thing I've ever
read like my mondays are going to be
great because I love what I do it sounds
so silly but honestly having a job that
I love like what more could you ask for
in life honestly it's just amazing
another thing that I want to tell you
guys is that I changed my tumblr your
URL it's usually vans - and - spray tans
which was literally what I made four
years ago and I thing
it's just about time that I kind of grew
up a little bit from that stage so I
changed it to shiny grim and um so if
you guys want to follow me on tumblr
just head over to shiny grim and humble
dog home so promotion right there and
there's one more thing that I want to
tell you guys and that is that I'm that
is that I'm a little I'm moving houses
tomorrow I'm moving in with my mom and
my brother sister which is who I live
with now originally I was going to move
out with my brother or even by myself
because I was having some like problems
with my mom like sometimes we just clash
a little bit um but I do rely still want
to live with my mom and brother sisters
so yes um moving tomorrow and I get the
main bedroom because I'm filming like I
want to be feeling every single day so
much so that I can have the main bedroom
I just have to pay extra board which is
totally totally fine um I think that is
actually all that I have to say I'm
sorry this like and it was so long like
this whole vlog was basically just me
talking I really wanted to just make
this video to give you guys an update so
what did i do today I went I went and
got some lunch well late lunch / dinner
I don't even know um and I took you guys
to the post office what a fun day all
you guys should definitely know in the
comments what your favorite restaurant
is because I'm loving trying out
restaurants lately like the one we tried
today was so good and it wasn't like
unhealthy sometimes I get kind of guilty
when I eat unhealthy food like when I go
to mecca's and I have have some Macker
aye
I feel like absolute turd like after I
eat it so it was good that I didn't feel
like that today it's such a relieving
feeling because I do eat pretty bad but
that was delicious so yeah I think that
is all that I have to tell you guys um
thank you so much for watching this
video and I love you guys so much and
I'll see you very soon
but then again what was I going to put
my eyeshadows in anyway I also got all
these eyeshadows from morphe the one
