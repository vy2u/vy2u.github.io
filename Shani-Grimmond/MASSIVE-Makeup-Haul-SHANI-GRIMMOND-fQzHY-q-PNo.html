my channel so today I am doing a makeup
haul my seats really squeaking as a lot
of you guys would know I got broken into
and all my makeup was taken so I did buy
everything that I already earned again
that I love so I'm not going to share
that with you that's so boring I'm just
going to share all the new stuff that I
have got since then so I'm actually so
excited because a lot of these things
are new holy grails of mine and I
haven't done a haul in the longest time
the next hole that I'm going to do
hopefully be like a clothing haul
because the weather has changed a lot
since last time abilities so let's start
with the lipsticks behind me because
lipsticks are my favorite thing ever so
this my friend this Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick collection it's what I call
absolutely living to the fullest these
are the most beautiful lipsticks ever I
love them so much so the first one is in
the shade very victoria and it's just
like a really nice Bharani nude color
these are honestly so incredibly
pigmented and also really moisturizing
as well this one would be one of my
favorites
out of all of these that I have right
here actually I don't know I love the
balm I'm sorry I can't decide I feel
like a lot of you will know what this
shade is right here this is in the shade
at Glastonbury it's a really nice deep
dark purple it is absolutely gorgeous
perfect for fall or autumn as we call it
here in Australia but this is the one
that zoella talks about all the time
next we have the shade it's sexy sienna
yeah what so it looks like this right
here it's a really nice peachy pink very
very wearable then we have a shade
Penelope pink this one is stunning I
don't really see too much thinking it
this one's definitely more of a nude
color as you can see right here it
reminds me a lot of the Mac in the shade
honey love cross myth
I think it's met a really light nude
color living that for this lipstick this
is in the shade
carpet red it's a really nice deep
purple wait so I just say purple I meant
deep red actually when you swatch it
it's not as deep as it looks in the
bullet so this is what it looks like in
the bullet and that's it
swatched it's actually a lot lighter
than I thought but I still think it's
gorgeous I'm a sucker when it comes to
red lips I love red lips because it
makes your teeth look white and your
lips look really juicy the next color is
in the shade bitch perfect it is a
beautiful and nerdy pink color it's
honestly one of the most easy to pull
off lipsticks so if you are interested
in getting some sharp look some
Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks this would
definitely be the one that I would lean
towards first especially if you don't
like really bold kind of colors this one
is very similar to this new right here
but it is a bit more pink okay so the
last one is in the shade of Birkin Brown
and this is a very unique color I don't
know how to describe it I haven't even
washed it yet so let's just see what
this looks like so this is the color
right here definitely unique I don't
even know how to describe that color
it's like a chestnut brown there we go I
tried I am very excited about these ones
right here this is the true face melted
liquefied long wearing lipsticks so I
have heaps of shades right here we have
like a really dark pink and the rest are
like nudie pinks and we have the purple
right here which is gorgeous so I have
had one of these before in the full-size
and to be honest I didn't really use it
I don't know why I just would always
lean towards like my Mac or my liquid
lipsticks or something but I definitely
am going to give these a try since we
have more of a color variety so I'm
going to swatch this and see what it
looks like oh my god that is next-level
that is incredible I love that they send
the little baby sizes the one that I
used to have was like a full size and it
was absolutely huge and to be honest I'm
never going to finish one of these
especially a big one because I have so
many different lipsticks I'm going to
keep trying out so I think it's amazing
that they have the smaller sizes I'm
pretty sure this comes in the Holiday
Collection for like Christmas
something so I definitely would
recommend these they also send me I can
appellate so I showed you in a second
that's why they also sent me some more
lipsticks these ones are actually so
freakin pretty so we have a pink right
here let's have a little swatch of this
one this is actually the most creamy
consistency this ones are a lot more
sheer than the other liquid lipsticks
that I just showed you but I actually
love the blood that I love them so this
one is in the shade nude beach and this
would have to be my favorite out of the
three so this is a darker version and
the one that I just shared through right
here and dude last one I may be honest I
don't like it it is a go consistence and
stuff but it's like a shimmery shade and
it has like little sparkles in it you
can see right here focus on my and yeah
I just know being a fan of like shimmery
lipstick I'm not gonna lie I have so
many more lipstick to share with you but
I'm just going to take a break from them
for a second talk about something else
so this is the NARS blush in the shade
luster this would have to be one of my
favorite blushes I have it on today is a
gorgeous peachy shade it's not true pink
which I like because a lot of but a lot
of blushes are pink that was a bit hard
to see so this has a lot of God reflexes
in it sorry it acts as a beautiful
highlight at the same time as making
your cheeks look nice and youthful so
definitely one of my favorite blushes
the next thing that I have here is the
Girl Meets pearl this is a liquid pearl
base so I don't know if this is supposed
to be a highlight or girl under your
foundation if it is a highlighter I'm
not going to use it for that because
it's not intense enough for me I love
really dramatic highlighters but I might
actually use it right let's have a look
at it first if you like pump if you like
twist the lid stuff comes out the top so
when you swatch it on your hand it's not
really that dramatic so I'm thinking you
do put it under foundation and that's
what I'm going to do do myself a nice
glow it is like a peachy golden color so
I think it will look beautiful under
foundation next i have the charlotte
tilbury iminium miracle i want so on one
side you have a eye cream so i think
it's a great idea to have it between one
because you can quickly put your eye
cream down and then you go in with the
color corrector it says it is a eye
brightener but it's really dark maybe I
just got the wrong shade I think this is
in a shade for I think I need one this
would probably be dark enough to contour
my face I might actually buy that in the
correct shade because everything that
I've tried from shell Tilbury is really
good and I think it's worth giving it a
try so the next thing that I have here
are summer color pop eyeliners if you
didn't know any color pop came out with
pencil liners and also gel liners and I
am obsessed they sent me the whole
collection and literally I was like
hyperventilating on the floor I would so
excited that they sent these to me so
thank you so much color pop they have a
lot of shades from Purple's Pink's
yellows greens goals white black they
literally have every color in the book
of colors so they are extremely
pigmented let me just watch this blue
one right here just so you can see what
I'm talking about like are you kidding
me right now
I would say this one would have to be my
favorite this is in the shade dirty talk
it's literally just like a pure gold you
can see that right here it's honestly
setting I like to put these in my
waterline to add like a pop of color or
a pop of gold or whatever so yeah I
think that a really good quality so I'm
just going to share with you the gel
liners as well so again they have like
all the colors that the pencils have
literally every color you can think of
this one is so pretty it's like a really
nice purple so I'm just going to rub my
finger in there and show you the color
payoff how lurid that is stunning could
you imagine like a really nice bright
purple went a lanai if only I can do
winged eyeliner I suck I practiced so
much because getting all these amazing
Oh amazing products I was like yes I'm
going to learn how to do Johanna I'm
gonna have
amazing wing by the end of the day I
suck at wing liner and it honestly never
think I'm going to be able to do it oh
this one's pretty this one is like a
coppery peach color it's in the shade
get paid oh yeah girl I was wondering
what smelt like a big and you just
took a dump on her permit lucky it was
on her tenant that's a sure hey you did
a poopy on your mallet I am so proud of
you say hello to my subscribers see how
y'all or she's honestly so beautiful
like I feel like I have this really
weird strong connection with her like
how obsessed with her does everyone else
have that problem like I would call it a
problem with their dog their princess
all she's like can't see because all
these lights next we have some makeup
geek blushes I did have some of these
before they got stolen by makeup people
it's kind enough to send me literally
like their whole collection and if you
guys don't know me then you wouldn't
know that I'm the biggest makeup geek
aholic I love makeup geek
products so when I got this package I
was like lord help me so I'll just share
with you the new ones that I have so
this one is in the shade spellbound it's
a beautiful black pink color the next
one is in the shade honeymoon this one
is even lighter than that one
as you can see right here and this one
money money whoo okay honey Marion has a
lot of like shimmers throughout it like
silver reflex so I think that'd be
really pretty and highlighting then we
literally have a purple blush hello
this isn't a shade it's secret admirer I
am so in order to try this
I've never earned a purple blush in my
life I've never tried one and don't
bless I can't wait okay I have that one
and I have that one but this one this is
in the shade romance it's a gorgeous
peachy gold blush hey this looks a lot
like the nerves
oh my god twins the next thing that I
have is the Charlotte Tilbury wonder
glow so you can use this with your
foundation on top of foundation as a
highlight or instead of foundation so I
have this on today i commonly tell too
much of a difference but i'm going to
keep using it over the first time I've
used it I know that Charlotte Tilbury
would never let me down I have so much
faith in you Charlie
but yeah I should stop being weird now
very excited to keep using this and see
how awkward it is time to talk about
some liquid lipstick stickers my
favorite thing my favorite makeup shut
up my favorite makeup product isn't
lipsticks right now so these are the
shades that I have been sure I hold
these up here
these are shades that I've been looking
for for the longest time on Anastasia on
this side that side haven't found them
they're sold out because everyone wants
a piece of this so this is the brand de
la splash and to be honest I've never
heard one person in my whole entire life
talk about these and when I saw the
color range of like done I'm going to
buy them right now
so we have this shade cryptic right here
and then og ghoulish and then ghoulish
so these are all very very similar
shades or just like a concreting like
purple kind of lip color honestly to die
for I also have some more shades right
here yes of course I bought 100 I'm
ready
dark cranberry colors living for them so
this is in the shade Raven a beautiful
dark burgundy color then we have hip
hypnotize which is a orangie red color
love this and then all of these are
pretty similar to the others so I
could've not to say that it oh my god
there we have the shade Rose golden
right here also if you're into those
pinky colors and then more of a nude
this is in a shade charmed I think this
is a lip gloss actually honoring wait I
need to quickly swatch one just so you
can see how incredible they are okay
ready ready Freddy Howard and they dry
out to a matte formula
honestly oh my god when I first watched
these they didn't come off for two days
and I look like the biggest barrel feels
walking around with all the
swatches on my arm I get in one of the
shops and fill my bag it that pay on
your arm and I was like no it's actually
lipsticks they have a come off they're
just really good time to talk palettes I
have so many palettes so first thing I
have is the BH cosmetic ultimate braaap
health so it comes with all of these
different shades we have some wax
formulas as well down the bottom so you
have three different I have the hiccups
three different waxes and I thought this
would be a good idea because I'm always
like drawing my eyebrows to be like
black right now they're talking true by
because I didn't go too heavy today so I
thought if I gave myself the option to
use a ladder color maybe I wouldn't have
caterpillars on my face so maybe that
will shut everyone up if I use that
palette okay so next thing I have is the
olive oil I thought it wasn't recording
the manizer sisters by the balm so this
comes with three shades three shades
that everyone should have
mary lou manizer i'm sure everyone in
that cats and dogs have heard about this
one of the best highlighters of all time
so pigmented so intense living for this
highlighter then we have it since mm-hmm
yep drop in my palettes then we have
that cindy lou manizer which is well i
use for a blush it's just so pretty and
luminizing then we have betty loumanizer
so that's like a bronzing shade just
adds like a goddess look to the face
what use them all at once would only go
with one shimmery thing at a time
including highlighter but if you did all
this at once you may look like a disco
ball but that may be a book you want
which is probably what I'm gonna do next
I have the on top the taupe palette from
zoeva I love the way the eyeshadows
especially their brushes like their
brushes are next level I'm not kidding
you sorry my fingers caught this is a
cruel turned eyeshadow palette we have
four match shades and the rest are
shimmery they're very pigmented and
buttery and Isador so next we have the
BH Cosmetics nude rose palette this will
have to be my favorite palette from BH
Cosmetics I can't believe how pigmented
these are I thought because they're
cheaters they'll be just like powdering
it wouldn't last in the eye
they lost their batteries they're
pigmented so the color range in this
palette is on point sources like the
rosy gold colors so now for some true
face of eyeshadows these are the pellets
from the Holiday Collection this one on
top in particular I have to go get it
right now it's honestly incredible so
pigmented like just like the makeup geek
eyeshadows which is saying something so
this is what it looks like right here
this one at the top is literally
iridescent it's like a pink with gold
reflexes but like next level I'm not
sure that this one I don't know if this
is a bronzer it looks like a bronzer
because it's really big yeah all the
other colors are sorry gorgeous I feel
like this is a palette they could
actually use every single shade out of
it you know when you get a palette and
you like oh there's true those two curls
are pretty well another use the rest for
this one it's like a different story the
next one the black with the pink ribbon
looks like this this is more of like a
funky purpley kind of palette they're
all pretty much cool tones then lastly
the blue palette is a warm Torrence
palette so you have like all the
transition shades and everything
basically for a smoky eye and then you
have a nice pink blush to finish it off
it's time it's that time to talk about
the new makeup geek eyeshadows so if you
guys have been watching me for a while
you would know that I have this palette
with all black the original like older
eyeshadows for a makeup geek that are
like completely still 100% my favorite
buy shows of all time but I picked up
some new colors right here so we have
like a lot of dusty rosy pinky kind of
colors which I think so beautiful these
are also pigmented obviously the same as
the same formula as the other ones I'm
pretty soft and then we have the
colorful eyeshadow palette so I'm
literally loving these three orange
ashes at the top because I love doing
like warm smoky eyes or my shoulder
looks in general and if you pop this in
the crease it makes it look even more
warm
and they just look so beautiful so we
have lots of blues and purples this one
in particular is honestly
stunning we have a bright bright white
is that even a thing and then we have
some yellow shades down here so all
these colors are insane oh my god
there's one more eye shadow I have to
share with you I'm just kidding I found
a whole new palette that I was going to
talk about today I got it and I nearly
forgot about it
Wow so this is another theme palette
from makeup geek with their eye shadow
isn't it I'm pretty sure this eyeshadow
palette in particular is like exclusive
to makeup geek so the first two rows
except for these two eyeshadows are
iridescent so they change color in
different lighting this one in
particular is like my life it's like a
peachy golden color in the shade matte
eye and then down here we have more of
the foiled eyeshadows so this one is in
the shade flame through a lot and it's
like a copper a really really rich warm
copper color and I think everyone needs
any or less okay seriously one last I
shadow I have to share with you from
makeup geek this is my original palette
by the way but I chopped this new one in
here sorry this isn't a shade Neptune
ah you're kidding me this is so
pigmented oh I have to go tutorial with
this I seriously do like now you don't
really got me when I realized that the
people that broke into my house took 15
of my MAC lipstick though my favorite
lipstick so I had to rebuy rebuy
repurchase them all and I got two more
as well so the first one is in the shade
story I literally could not live without
a backless medal I couldn't live without
a MAC lipsticks they're just really
really good quality they last ages that
creamy they're buttery there everything
that you want in a lipstick so this is a
really unique round color looks kind of
scary doesn't it this is what it looks
like right here and then we have a shade
taupe which is this one this one is more
of like a warm color so cool turn warm
tone I have never worn a cool toy
lipstick in my life so yeah thanks for
making a change in this world and being
different and lastly what am I going to
share with you more lipsticks sorry I
have to be
cosmetics lipsticks I have every single
shade right here and then we have a few
more up here which are stuck in my
lipstick holder I'll take care of that
later so this one would have to be one
of my favorites it's just a really nice
and red color this is in the shade slam
again when I got it I was like oh
they're really cheap like really really
cheap so I was like maybe there won't be
as good as some of my other lipsticks
but trust me they are just as good so
let's do a little swatch now we're
talking honey there are a lot of shades
in the collection that are just so
stunning and just colors that everyone
loves and then we have the shades that
normally people would wear and they're
just very unique and different so these
are some of those shades there's also
like greens and oranges and all these
crazy different colors so I think that's
really cool that they have like
different kind of colors or overall well
done well for can dump eh these are
insane so we are going to head off now
we are going to go for a walk what's
excited Google walkies anyways I hope
you guys like this video if you did
please give it a big a big thumbs up
because it honestly helps me out so so
much and yeah I'll see you in my next
year
I just spat on the screen sorry about
that doll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
