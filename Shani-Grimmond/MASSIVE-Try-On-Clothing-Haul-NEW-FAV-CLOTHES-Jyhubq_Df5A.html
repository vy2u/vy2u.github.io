channel so in today's video I'm doing a
massive massive clothing haul I'm so
excited I have literally a million
different brands miss video and I've
been collecting this stuff for like two
months now and so excited to share them
with you because they are amazing
amazing it's fun so we have brands from
princess Polly to kukai to butter
literally everywhere so let's go ahead
and start with the stuff from princess
Polly because that's the stuff that I
got this morning and I'm super excited
about them I'm like oh my gosh but the
stuff let's go right now because the
clothes are amazing and you guys know
that I always have it it's kind of crew
with princess Polly so if you guys want
20% off feel free to use occurred love
Shani
and what's that let's start with the top
that I'm wearing right now actually I'm
about talking fast cuz I'm feeling so
good hit when the ear hangs out this is
what it looks like I love that it has
like a lot of boobie going on because
like that's just my thing but when you
wear tops that have like a lot of
cleavage in whatever usually you have to
either tape up the boob or the roof fall
out and with this one everything is
literally all tucked in it's really
secure you can make it through the part
if you want with this little ribbon
right here or you can make it looser if
you want but I just love how it like
fits perfectly and it will fit perfectly
to every single body shape and boob size
because it's adjustable for you guys
that don't know I'm actually going to
bar late today so a lot of these things
that I got from princess Polly are
literally things that I'm like I needed
to Bali I needed for Bali like or like
really summery clothes really
comfortable and all that so this one I
thought is perfect it's really
lightweight and the color is literally
everything I love this green color at
the moment I'm obsessed with it you guys
have no idea how excited I am for this
next piece I've been seeing this sled
around
Instagram and basically the whole
interweb for like two months now and I
finally got my hands on it it's just
beautiful Rohit so it's made out of
little like silver metal leaves I just
think it is so gorgeous honestly I don't
even know where I'm going to wear this
but I do know that I'm going to take
some amazing photos in it are you
kidding me like this is taking fashion
to the next level and I'm I'm ready this
is something that I have to wear to a
festival I do
have on coming up very soon which is
like perfect timing and it does cover
everything really well I'm just tell
we're like little nipple covers just in
case but Elise goes flying up in the
wind or something the next thing that we
have is one of my favorite colors to
wear when it comes to clothes and that
is this beautiful deep and muted color I
really like deep mousse just because it
really complements my 10 and when I wear
a lighter news it makes me look washed
out and I like to blend into my clothes
but I really love this color this one is
just a cropped sweater it is super
comfortable everywhere all day and I'm
obsessed so that I've really taken the
time off because I take my tags off
every single piece of clothing piece of
piece of clothing that I own because for
some reason tags each my back so bad
like everyone else is fine with tags but
I'm like thanks and I pretty much have
holes in nearly every single thing that
I own but not this one this is the brand
white closet I love that brand so much
but I really like the texture that I has
on it as well it's not just like a plain
nude it has like all these little quilts
in it bindi is sitting on all of my
clothes on the ground and every time I
go and pull one out she literally like
wakes up and looks at me in anger and
back to sleep so this is going to
wasting you up a lot because I have
literally like 20 pieces next thing that
I have is this orange crop so this is
the same top that I'm wearing right now
but in orange if you guys saw my last
video I lost clothing haul has know that
I have a really weird obsession with
orange at the moment I just think it
looks so good everyone's intern it's
just so vibrant and like happy the
fluttering so I feel like this one I'm
going to definitely dress up with a
white high waisted shorts I have these
really nice ones from chic and then I'm
going to wear as gold diamond choker
fake diamond choker
the next thing we have is kind of in the
same color range but it is more of a
bronzey color so like wow look at this I
feel like it's so luxurious looking at
so like classy so I'm going to wear this
wear that a massive belt because it has
this elastic band around the waist and I
feel like it's just going to dress it up
so much you obviously could wear it
casually if you wanted to but I'm
definitely in a wear this out clubbing a
couple if I could go clubbing this
weekend I usually go clubbing every
single weekend whole this isn't saying
but the reason why I feel like this is
Serge refuse because the material it's
like really nice shiny silky looking
material every time I say shiny tell
such funny shiny shiny shiny shiny I
have been loving at basic teeth lately
what I like to do is just tie up around
like the belly button area and wear
high-waisted shorts or skirt or whatever
I just love stripes as well as straps in
or something because they're everywhere
this material is so soft and you guys
know I'm all about that comfort lab so
I'm going to be living in this I love
this one so much like it's a joke
actually drew I literally haven't even
taken the tags off everything work I've
had this stuff for two hours so excited
I am okay the next one we have is this
crop I love the color this is kind of
like a ready orange color and my
favorite thing about this is a spaghetti
strap I've always loved CEO distress I
don't know why it's like a weird a
fetish that I have with clothes if one
is a really soft and stretchy material
so I'm going to wear celac
or denim with this top oh my god okay so
the next thing that we have from
princess Polly I really need to
interrupt this like clothing section for
a second and talk about the Geoffrey
style highlight they are the only people
in Australia so as I'm aware that stock
jeffree star so this is the new Geoffrey
start many nua are high light so you
can't I really want oh my god pull it
off it puts it okay I feel like my
highlight is not as intense I'd like it
right now so let's see what it looks
like actually my highlight really was
very intense isn't it oh that is like on
another level that's so pretty if you
guys like really intense highlighters
I'm sure you either loved it
if you don't like intense highlighters
literally stay away but also I just want
to quickly talk about these because it's
so cool I feel like you guys are gonna
think I'm a weirdo for these but um I
wanted these for like really cool like
photos you know II mean I kind of look
at this hexagons
1 2 3 4 5 6 had six corners
every time I'm shopping online I always
think about the sodas that I'm going to
get is that sad poor nerve voids done
that I can't help it like I basically
live on social media I laughed a bit
called photos so I could last you get
cool props this is the pose I'm going to
do is that really cringe
anyways let's go back onto the clothes
so the next thing we have here is a
black wait what is this is the dress or
a jumpsuit
only it's definitely a dress this is
just something but you can just check on
and it's going to look super cute I
think I'm gonna rock an all-black look
with this outfit so black boots black
bag black sonnies all give it to me next
we have a jumpsuit to add to my
collection I already have like a million
but this one is by far the most unique
one okay so when you look at this don't
get scared cause it's very different but
just think of barley okay so you think
it's a beach think of like really slowly
outfit and think of color so this one is
a very floral it has a v-neck and again
it cinches around the waist like the
only every jumpsuit does because you
don't want to look the box I mean if you
do that's cool because like I'm pretty
much a box every day in my life because
I like to wear my pajamas all day every
day oh I just realize it has these two
little straps that you can tie up around
the neck at the bar oh oh I'm pretty
sure that's why I got it because I saw
that I looked so unique I've never seen
a jumpsuit with that before okay we're
still tall and princess collies see what
I mean I got so much from there this one
is I think one of my favorites yes my
favorite so this one is a at the lack of
jumpsuit and it has so many cool cutouts
on it it is so different to anything
that I have it's kind of like similar to
the top of the ring right now I guess
that trends kind of coming at the moment
how everything ties up around the boob
area it has little ruffles at the bottom
which i think is so cute and also around
at the boob area so if you guys are
donor I'm actually a size 8 in
everything if you guys need a hand with
like sizes or anything I'm how tall am I
180 or maybe like 176 30 minutes I don't
know about all these jumpsuits get me
really nicely you guys need to seriously
buckle up because I didn't have a
princess fully filled bags and I look
around their whole website and whole let
me tell you this bag is stunning so this
is what it looks like this is what I'm a
top bigger it's like milk coming out so
I'm going to take this traveling um it's
going to fit literally everything in it
I needed something really big so I can
fit my laptop in it I do have a Leviton
which is pretty much the exact same
sizes but the straps on it are really
thin and it cuts my circulation on my
shoulder so I'm glad these ones are
and because I'm going to Bali I don't
want to take a little bag because like
I'm so like faced with everything in
Bali so I feel like it's just gold sake
if I take my Louie so we've got this one
as a substitute if you guys follow me on
Instagram I'm sure you would see me wear
this it's so soft and cuddly I just
wanna cuddle myself but I'm wearing it
certainly so this is just like a black
fluffy cropped jumper it is so
comfortable but like really really hot I
was in Melbourne and it's for raising in
Melbourne and I was actually sweating
and I'm like this is a joke it is
starting to get colder in Brisbane so I
may be out of web it's a lot more but so
now it's kind of like hanging in my
cupboard chillin I just pulled this
stuff from my closet because emotions
playing the wounded million times this
one is from Oh glutton so this one is a
long dress what do you kind of thing so
I got to the shade are we are we
actually going there Shani you know I
got this size extra large so I could
wear as like a really long dress jumper
like really casual and chill so it has a
hoodie on the back and it's kind of like
this really nice nudey creamy beige
color and really glad this hasn't shrunk
in the washing machine so I can actually
still wear it as a dress because you
know when you put something the water
Schmidt that's ruined let me put
something in with the wrong color feels
the next thing that we have is from
adidas I'm just giving a cool adverse
some when people call it a data size I
want to chop my fingers off so this one
is like a beige and black two-piece well
you had to buy the severally I was like
two more to go with but they look so
nice together
and it's just something that I'm going
to wear like everywhere to the movies to
the shops clubbing because I want to
next we have a few things from at
fashion Nova so we have it true assets
right here oh the shirt fell off what do
you mean yeah true steps right here so
first one is like a blush pink color and
we have a gray color I'm sure you guys
have seen Kylie Jenner promote because
she premiered it and it was scandal
because she had a camel toe up me though
you know how many times I've edited my
camel toe out and photos ooh kidding why
is she getting in for that these
outfits honestly it's so comfortable but
they look really good at the same time
like I love anything high-waisted and
these come up past my belly button so
like I'm already sold there it's
the home obsessed this next piece is so
makes me emotional cause I love it that
much but I bought there for an event and
I run them all at once and it wasn't
cheap so I really will wear it again but
I don't know where it's so dressy but
this is from chic I absolutely adore
chic quality of their stuff is
incredible I love the suede material on
this and the color like that the lush
tone is so gorgeous this is a cape and
then it comes with well it doesn't come
with because of separate but we have the
high-waisted shorts as well and it has a
little belt buckle this is just
something that is so classy and to me so
flattering to the eye life the next
thing that I have is from a cook eye and
a little cool guy this is just a basic
white um it looks like an oversized
shirt but it is so gorgeous with a black
belt it looked really ugly on the stand
honestly but I had a trial Sonja would
have potential and it is so gorgeous I
love the really long sleeves the
material is very heavy so if you get
very hot when I was throwing it but like
it's great quality next we have a new
pair of shoes these ones are from Nike I
know a lot of people call them Nike but
no they're called not I'm probably wrong
but I love this color so much like that
oatmeal yd cream color I do have a
feeling these are going to sell out very
very quickly so I'm glad I got in when I
did I'm pretty sure these only released
like a week area like battery yeah
something like that engineered for
all-day everyday comfort oh I can't
Rodney's was known to of gold woman
answers I want 150 which is like all
shoes are expensive EJ the last thing
that we have is like Gucci bag I got
this like a month ago and I honestly
want it I'd have to say every single day
of my life where I've left this half
it's just like a perfect everyday bag
that fits everything in it I did have a
Prada before this but it was too big for
like everyday and I do like how it has a
long strap and it's not sitting
underneath my armpit anyways guys I
really hope you enjoyed it today's video
