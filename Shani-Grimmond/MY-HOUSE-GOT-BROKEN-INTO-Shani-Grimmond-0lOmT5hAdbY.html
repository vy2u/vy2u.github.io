harder than I thought um so I'm filming
the video Oh
my explanation of why I've been away as
you can see like I'm not in the same
house as I was I actually root asses so
my house was broken into one month ago
so I was in New Zealand with my
boyfriend on a holiday I honestly never
ever ever would have thought something
like this would have happened
um so basically I was at the New Zealand
airport coming home waiting for my
flight like waiting to board and
everything and my mum text me and she's
like something you know I have some
really bad news to tell you and I was
like oh my god like honestly I was
freaking out because she had bindi and
she was looking after bindi and um I
thought something had happened to her
like I thought she literally had died
and I was freaking out was like what
happened tell me quick knowing about it
I was like starting to like
hyperventilate and then she's like your
house was broken into and I was like
like well I hadn't no words I did not
know what to say I remember asking mum
how much did they take and she said
everything and at this point I didn't
really know like how it happened I
didn't know anything about it all I knew
is that they took absolutely everything
I had like no idea who it could have
been because no one not many people at
all knew where I lived I never told
anyone where I lived so I eventually got
home and I got home at nighttime I was
so like the whole drive home the whole
flight in I just couldn't stop thinking
I'm like what could they have taken like
what do I own and then I just thought
maybe mum was like over exaggerating
like maybe they only took a few things
so we eventually got home I walked
inside mum had cleaned up all over the
fingerprint marks that good place had
left because she didn't be coming home
to like a trash place so she like
vacuumed all the glass up off the floor
she picked up all the clothes I had
Kroon everywhere like some of the
clothes that they left behind they even
took a four dollar can of alcohol from
the cupboard the thing that really upset
me was knowing that someone had gone
through my stuff and invaded my privacy
I honestly felt so disgusted and so
scared to be in that house to even stand
in there with my whole family I was just
like get me out of here I don't want to
be here they took my car keys um they
took my house keys I was just like well
they could be coming back for my car
they could be coming back into the house
like I just didn't know what their
intentions were like honestly I don't
care that they took my makeup I don't
care that they took my camera like
whatever but I just felt so invaded and
so so unsafe before any of this happened
I was the most trusting person ever I
trusted anyone and everyone because I've
never really been hurt that bad so I
never felt the need not to trust people
and then after the break-in I hope I now
have trust issues I can't trust anyone
I honestly questioned the littlest
things like if someone wants to be my
friend I'm like do they really want to
be my friend or are they using me like
for followers or something like I
honestly just I can't trust anyone and I
have trust issues now which really sucks
because from going going from someone
that was so trusting to like not at all
it's like it sucks something that really
really frustrates me makes me so angry
is not that they have managed Anton's
stuff and they're treating it like it's
theirs like they have worked for it
Jonathan I worked so freaking hard to
get everything that we ever owned up to
18 and Jonathan 23 like they basically
took all that hard work away from us so
just knowing that they have it and they
didn't work for it they stole it is
honestly the most frustrating thing ever
so it got to the point where I was like
get me the out of this house
because I hate it so much and I don't
want to be here and every time I walked
in my front door I would be like
imagining people going through my stuff
and people being there I didn't know of
so I was just like get me out of here I
can't do any more I packed up the stuff
that I had left shoved it in bags
probably broke a few things on the way
because I was just like packing that
quickly put in my car and went to mom's
house and I stayed at mom's house for a
month that way that way that's why I
wasn't filming she had no backgrounds at
all I was pretty much not emotionally
stable to make videos I didn't have my
camera I didn't have makeup I had
nothing to make videos with so there was
no possible way that I could have made
videos unless I went and bought camera
straight away but in my mind I was
thinking maybe maybe the police will
catch them and I'll get my stuff back
that's why I was holding off for a bit
and either way I wouldn't have been able
to make videos because I was just like
mmm I wasn't crying very much like I
wasn't crying very much at all I was
just like really like disgusted in
people and I just didn't want to talk to
anyone except my family because I knew
that I could trust them something really
good did come out of it I grew so much
closer to my family because I was
staying there for so long and I am now
living in this most beautiful place ever
and it literally is non-breakable no one
can get in here it's like a
prison so I feel really safe and I feel
like I can leave my stuff in my room
without someone coming in to steal it so
since I had my keys I did not leave one
thing in my car because they literally
could have just got in driven off and
that stall and everything I'm sorry I
keep swearing I'm just like really like
I did a tit ah but yeah so the bottom
line of this whole entire video is
you've got to get contents insurance you
have to cover everything that you earned
in case something bad happened the case
of fire in case someone breaks into your
house I mean it happens it really does
so if anything has recently happened in
your life that's bad or made you sad
just know that things will get better it
just does take time it would say that's
just the main thing it just takes time
and
you can be sad you can cry like it's
totally fine to not be okay but after
you let all those emotions out it's time
to just get up and move on and put the
past in the past and don't look back and
just focus on bigger and better things
which is what I'm doing now I can just
say I'm so happy with where I'm at now I
haven't been sad about the whole
break-in for a while um but talking
about it to you guys has made me a
little bit emotional but anyway I'm
sorry this video is so long I just want
to explain absolutely everything um
thank you guys for watching and thank
you for sticking around while I've been
away
I really really love you guys so so much
and I don't want anyone to feel sorry
for me or give me sympathy I really
don't want that I'm totally fine I just
wanted you guys to know and for you guys
to get insurance that feels good to get
it off my chest
I'll see you in my next video I'm going
to be constantly uploading now and I'm
so excited okay I love you guys so much
and I'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
