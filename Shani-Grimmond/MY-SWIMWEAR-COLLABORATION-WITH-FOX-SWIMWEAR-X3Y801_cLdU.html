my channel so in today's video I have a
really exciting one for you I'm so
excited
so I have teamed up with a white box
boutique which is also Fox swimwear they
have their own swimwear line and we have
collaborated to bring to you eight
pieces of swimwear so we have six
bikinis and two one pieces and I am
obsessed with bikinis right I have so
many in my cupboard and I can sit here
and honestly tell you that these are the
nicest one pieces and bikinis I have
ever seen I'm not even kidding we're
going to be talking about the whole
process the prices the prints why name
them certain things let's go ahead and
get into the juicy stuff so that I can
show you them on amazing okay so let's
go back to about two months ago when
Jonathan and I went into the white box
boutique office to have a meeting I had
never been to a meeting before keep that
in mind I was really freaking nervous so
I pretty much just sat there for about
four or five hours just throwing around
different ideas what would work and what
wouldn't what would suit a lot of
people's body types not just wine we
wanted this to like work for everyone so
once we had all the sketches drawn it
was time to go over to a big table and
just lay out all the pieces of paper and
match all the tops to the bottoms and
see what would work and was like
realistic and what people would wear on
like it everyday kind of basis one
that's the women girl then it was time
for the hardest part which was to choose
all of the colors so I just have like a
massive book of different fabrics and
colors we just had to cut off a little
bit and put it on the sketches to see
like if it would match that style and my
god there was so many colors in that
book I was like what do I do what color
is going to work this for everyone so I
thought I'm just go with like a few
bright colors a few like neutral colors
a nice mob because I'm obsessed with
more oh my god , to shoot them on so
once all the colors and everything were
done and they were sorted it was time to
send them off to get all the serval so
mean white folks kind of went back and
forth a few times trying them on and
seeing if they fit properly and
everything would changed a few things to
make sure they fit really perfectly and
that they're really comfortable and then
we have the finished products so guys
I'm going to show you what they look
like on and we're gonna start with the
one-pieces
okay so the first one piece looks a
little something like this this one is
called Hampton and it is $70 okay so I
want
this one to look really classy and I
think that's exactly how it came out
one thing that I'm completely obsessed
with about this is that I feel like you
can wear this as a bodysuit as well as a
swimsuit so it's kind of like a
two-in-one so this one has seen so it's
really going to hold your boobs and
you're not going to have any tip slips
or anything like that
it is really high up around the bum so
it is kind of cheeky but because it does
have seams again it's not going to give
you a wedgie yeah I really like how it
comes up really high past like the hip
so it's kind of like a little 90s
inspired this one is very bright white
so it's going to make your turn
look extravagant it does go quite low
down the boobs so if you don't mind a
little boobie this will look incredible
on you I'm a size medium in all the one
pieces and then in the Trib uses like
the bikinis I'm a size small just
because I do have a long torso and if I
have a small in the one pieces I get a
wedgie so that's that now let's move on
to the Tiffany blue colored bikini I
haven't seen any bikinis like this
before with this color so I thought
let's do it so here is what it looks
like really nice bright blue as you can
see and again this one comes up really
high past the hips I do think this will
also work if you wanted to wear this as
a bodysuit as well so again two in one
what can I say you're welcome now let's
move on to the bikinis and with the
bikinis they do come separately so you
do have to buy both of them if you want
to set you're not I mean so this top
right here for example is $50 and then
the bottoms are 35 so this one is in a
style oasis and as you can see this one
is just a really nice pipe inner fabric
it does just go straight across the
boobs and then at the back it has a
little something different it just has
four little plots that hold up at the
back and it does have it burning in the
side as well so it does stay up really
nicely around your buddies and then this
is what the bottoms look like right here
so these ones do have plots on the side
as well to kind of tie in with the tops
so most of the bottoms if not all of the
bottoms are quite cheeky on the bum area
what I like to do with these is pull
them up past my hips so they can kind of
come up words but if you want you can
just wear them straight on the hips as
well I think these ones are really good
for turning because you've got like just
a straight across on the boobs you don't
have any straps going up here but you
are going to get nice layers in your
back so because I was so obsessed with
its name
Skinner I had to do it in a different
bikini so this is another one that I
think is when I favorites like it has to
be because it's so different I have
hardly seen this around at all and it's
just so flattering on the boobs because
that pulls them together so this one is
called Luna I had to name this one after
my little baby girl because is where my
favorites emilina is my favorite person
ever person yeah there's also something
really special about this bikini top and
that is you can wear it in two different
ways so as you can see right here you
can just wear it across this way which
has the strap coming straight across or
you can just wear it like this with two
straps coming up around the side of your
neck and then we have the bottoms or
girl that look like this so these ones
are very cheeky just like all of the
others and it does have just like a thin
strap on the side so they're just like a
very classic pair of bottoms so because
that was one of my favorite styles of
the bikinis I had to get it in another
color so this one is a nice like pinky a
purpley multicolor I'm obsessed with
Marv at the moment mob is so in and the
material is really nice and silky it's
so comfortable so as I said before these
bikinis like really pull your boobs in
and then again at the bottoms are the
same ones as just before I'm definitely
keeping this color like pop and forever
like these colors and never going out of
fashion to me if everything so unique
these next bikinis are literally
breathtaking so hold on tight these ones
are called charmer you're kidding me
look at the color so this is like a burn
you know I just like talking makeup off
it sounds like a burn orange like bronzy
kind of color it is so different so
unique and I wanted something that was
kind of like a bra that's really going
to hold your boobs up in place so it
does have the padding on the inside that
you can remove out and it does have this
little sticky part here that really
sticks to your skin so everything is
really in place and you're not going
anywhere
trust me this also comes with straps
otherwise you can wear it strapless
another thing that I love about it the
bottoms oh my god these are crazy nice
so these ones do go are past the hips as
I was saying before you can pull the
other ones that past hips as well but
you can pick and choose but this one it
only does go up past there so this one
has a little line at the front a little
line at the back so they're not just all
plain they have a little something added
them and of course I had to add some
staples to the collection something that
was just like easy to chuck on your at
the door ready to go go to the beach
comfortable to wear good to turn in had
to get them off shade again because I
couldn't get enough of there so this is
just a basic triangle set it has a
really thin straps for the back and it
doesn't have a clasp or anything like
that so it's super comfortable and then
the bottoms are also really cheeky as
well and of course I had to call these
ones bendy because Billy is my pride and
joy and these ones are one of my
favorites even though I've said that
about every single one I'm sorry sorry
there's one more pair and then lastly we
have the same style a bindi but in the
shade at noon I had to make at least one
pair nude because half my closet is nude
the bottoms do you have this hem going
down the bottom that kind of like pulls
it all together it looks so good on why
