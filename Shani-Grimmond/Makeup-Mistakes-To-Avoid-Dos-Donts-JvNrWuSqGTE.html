channel so in today's video I'm doing
makeup mistakes to avoid and I guess
makeup do's and don'ts but what I mean
don'ts I don't actually mean that
obviously you can do whatever you want
when it comes to makeup because it's
your face and at the end of the day it
washes straight off so it's honestly not
a big deal but this is just kind of tips
and tricks that I thought I would share
with you guys to help you out a bit so
obviously this is the do side and this
is the don't obviously it is very
overdramatic I've never actually seen
someone with this on their face but it's
kind of just I'm kind of just going over
the top to prove a point so I really
hope you guys enjoy this video I don't
want it personally because I've done a
lot of these things in my life so yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video please
give it a big thumbs up and let's jump
straight into it alright guys so the
first thing that I'd recommend doing
when you're applying your makeup is put
a nice face down so I'm applying two
different moisturizers I go in with that
moisturizer just because I do have dry
skin but if you have oily skin I would
still a hundred percent recommend just
finding a moisturizer that suits your
skin type and putting that on before
your foundation because honestly it
makes that foundation blend out so much
easier and it doesn't cling to any dry
patches it just looks flawless so on the
don't side I didn't apply any
moisturizer and didn't blend as easily
that's all I can say when it comes to
primer you want to make sure that you
set it with a powder if you don't all
the eyeshadows will go patchy on your
eyelid and stick to certain areas and it
honestly is incredibly hard to blend out
the next tip that I have is try to avoid
putting any shimmery shades in the
crease especially if you have hooded
eyes like me because it really will
accentuate the sagginess of the skin the
next tip that I have is try to start
from lighter at the top and go to darker
at the bottom so if you want to do like
a smokey eye you can start from like a
nice light brown work your way up to a
darker Brown and then eventually you can
go to a black so that's what I'm doing
on the do side I'm starting with a nice
soft brown and just getting darker and
darker as we go and this will just
create more of a softer gradient
now it's time for foundation so this is
something a lot of people like to
comment on in the comments of my videos
so on the don't side I'm going to take a
foundation that matches the skin color
on my face and I'm just going to buff
this into my skin so as you can see the
color on my neck is completely different
because I fake tan and whether or not
the ten is real or you've used like a
foam or something like that a lot of the
times the ten does fade on your face so
you want to make sure that you match it
to your neck and then it's going to look
like our head and our shoulders are
actually attached okay so you want to
make sure when you're blending your
foundation in you don't want to actually
put it where you put your concealer
under the eyes just because it will make
the concealer that you put on over the
top really cakey so you just want to
leave that bit spare for the concealer
to let that do the work so I'm just
taking a concealer that is two shades
lighter than my skin tone and a Beauty
Blender is absolutely perfect to blend
out concealer
to set that concealer you want to make
sure you set that concealer because if
you don't it's going to crease really
bad just like this and it's not pretty
it won't last as long either
this one is crucial so when you apply
any sort of face product over your
foundation you want to make sure that
you set your foundation so example it
runs up blush highlighter contour all of
that you want to make sure the powders
down first and then you can go in with
the bronzer and stuff so right here I
just went straight in with the bronzer I
didn't set my face and the foundation
just really grabbed that runs that made
it super patchy you also want to apply
bronzer in moderation so just really
lightly and then build your way up
because obviously there's no going back
and also try not to go under the
cheekbone you want to bring it above to
add a nice like natural glow and that's
where the Sun would naturally hit not
under because that will just make it
look super muddy and dirty time for
contour so you want to make sure that
you start a very very light handed
because contour I can look muddy in
literally 1.2 seconds you want to also
make sure you don't bring it too far
towards your mouth otherwise it will
make you kind of look like a skeleton
and you also want to blend upwards
instead of downwards as you can see
right here it still is really defined it
looks really clean and crisp and if you
don't go past that finger it will look a
lot more natural as well when it comes
to baking there's honestly so many
different techniques that you can use
that look amazing
for me I like to take a nice yellow
shade and just dust that under my
contour to make it super sharp and clean
you want to kind of stay away from stuck
white shades because it can look super
fake and too sharp for the lower
lashline I like to keep it not dragged
down too much like it is right now
because it makes the eyes look very
raccoon like and also a lot smaller so I
think this way just makes an appeal but
also still evened out with the eyeshadow
on the top lid so for highlighter I like
to take a cream shade and put this under
my eyebrow really softly and then I go
in with the fat blending brush after to
blend it out so there's no harsh lines
at all and then on the don't side I just
went in with a stark white and I just
put shitloads of that on there and I
didn't blend it out and it just looks
super choppy and harsh
it's mascara time so I always find it
really really hard to apply mascara with
a big fat one like this I find that it
just gets all over my eyelid all under
my under eyes and it's super hard to get
off and it's annoying so if you use a
small one like this it's really easy to
just cut all of your lashes without it
being overly messy what I think looks
amazing is when you grab a pair of
lashes that still have a bit of space in
between them especially if you have
hooded eyes like me they can still be
super long and all of that super
dramatic you guys know I love my
dramatic lashes the other ones on the
don't side are just massive they go up
to my eyebrows they're super thick you
can't see any eyeshadow at all so it's
all about just finding the right pair
for your eyes and I also pinched my real
lash and the false lash together to make
sure there's no gap there at all a
really common mistake that a lot of
people make is smiling when you put your
blush on if you smile really hard in
reality when you stop smiling your whole
cheeks are going to droop down and it's
just going to make your face look droopy
so what you can do is just take small by
small amount and just put it on the
apples of your cheeks and blend it back
to make it look super natural and it's
just for a really nice flush of color
let's be real when it comes to people
applying too much highlighter most of
the time it's usually me so as you can
see right here it just really
accentuates those pores on my face when
usually you can't even see them and just
brings out a lot of texture in the skin
that you don't really want to be seen so
as you can see on this side it's just a
nice glow I mean it's not natural but it
just looks a lot better and it's not as
pori
this part was so much fun and not going
to lie so what I did was I took a really
dark shade I over drew my brows to the
point where they looked unnatural and at
the front of my brow I did like a little
box so what I'd like to do on the do
side is start from the tail of my brow
where I have the most product and when
there's not as much product on the brush
I like to go into the front my brows so
it's kind of like a nice gradient effect
obviously you can over draw your brows
as much as you want that's totally fine
but I just did it like overboard
for the lipstick I went in with a really
pale nude so it's all about finding
lipsticks that suit your skin tone so
obviously if you want a really pale nude
on the lips you could still go in with
this color on the do side but all you
have to do is kind of use it in
moderation so I first applied a lip
liner so it's nice and crisp and then I
went in with a darker nude that fits my
skin tone and then I just Pat that first
nude on the center of my lips to create
kind of an ombre lip and it just looks a
lot better setting spray is last but not
least so I'm just going to spray my good
side of my face and this will just soak
up any excess powder and it will make my
makeup stay on longer so there we have
my makeup do's and don'ts I hope you
guys learned something new in this video
or at least found it entertaining

see if we can get this video to 20,000
