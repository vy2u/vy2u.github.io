channel so in today's video I'm going to
be creating as this makeup look with
$2,000 worth of makeup I know that it's
so much money you definitely don't need
that much freaking money to be good at
makeup don't worry about that this is
just a little experiment you can
definitely create something like this
with drugstore makeup but I just thought
this will be a fun video if you guys to
watch so you have to get scribe to my
channel if you haven't already and let's
try and get this video to 20,000 lights
they'll be amazing ok let's go ahead and
jump right into it let's start with a
skincare so I always prep my skin before
I apply foundation
it makes my foundation go on so smooth
and it just looks really healthy and
radiant and also I do have dry skin so
make sure like the foundation doesn't
stick to any dry patches but if you're
Emily strays I would definitely
recommend doing that before you put your
foundation on so the one that I'm using
today is the emetic 8 vitamin C day
cream at this one is 130 dollars it's
very pricey but I've been using it for
about a month now and I'm obsessed with
it I'd never heard of the brand before
they sent it to me so I'm very happy
because it works wonders for my skin it
makes it so glowy so I'm just going to
take this much and rub it all over my
face so I like to do my eyeshadow before
I do my foundations so this is going to
allow all of the moisturizer to sink in
to the face before we get to soundy oh
it's shortened every word sorry I always
take my voice trouser in my hair so I
have like slick side versus absolute
honey
there's a hack for you guys it works
wonders I literally do it every day and
I'd like to go in with an eye cream as
well this one's only $20 I just thought
I would share it with you because it is
so good this one is an eye roll on so
you don't have to use your fingers which
is like the reason why I love it so much
so I just put my eyebrows on now I'm
going to go ahead and prime my eyelids I
love using the heart-shaped 8 to prime
my lids because it's really speak and it
literally covers everything so I'm just
going to go ahead and pack this on my
veins on my eyelids are literally so bad
so I need something really speak
just like that and I'm just going to set
that concealer down with my Rimmel stay
matte powder this stuff is literally as
cheap as dirt
but I'm obsessed a bit amazed every time
I do my eyeshadow now it's time for the
eyeshadow so I'm going to take this
Natasha to learn a star palette this one
is two hundred and twenty one dollars
Natasha dinner no pellets are really
really expensive but they are amazing
quality so this is what the colors look
like if you ever need to clean your
brushes last-minute I love to use this
one by morphe it is just the normal like
brush cleaner and it dries pretty much
instantly yeah
the first shade that I'm going to take
is this one right here and I'm just
going to put this in the crease and I'm
just using my Mac 2 to 4 brush and we're
just going to work this from adequate in
a corner and I'm going to blow this
we're not really high as we consider
blending so beautifully if I ever come
out with eyeshadows they have to be as
good as dashes now that I'm looking at
the palette I think I'm going to use a
different one just because like what can
you do like I've already done a burgundy
look I read on gold like thank you so
instead I'm just going to use this
eyeshadow palette right here this one is
the masquerade by julius place this is
what the colours look like they're
absolutely amazing I just bought this
last week so I really just want to play
with it so the next show that I'm going
to take is this one right here and I'm
going to use this to take another piece
this is actually the first time using
them on my eyes so let's see how they go
oh my god first impressions I literally
like incredible they're blending up so
easily I'm going to take that original
crease color and just blend out the
edges it's nice and smooth the next
shade I'm going to take is that this one
right here oh my god I literally am so
obsessed with these eyeshadows the
formula is so good so I'm just going to
focus this one on the outer half please
some more draw off just in there I'm
going to take this really pretty purple
and I'm going to do a halo eye so that
shades in a go on the outer half and in
a half and then I'm going to take a
different color on it your middle oh my
god earth
mr. goods so I'm just packing this on
with a short shader brush oh that's so
piggy pigmented and then I'm just going
to take a really small amount in my
crease just so it all kind of comes
together nicely and then I'm going to
take the shade and pack this right in
the middle so I just took my mac's fix+
on my little brush and pack it on
I love burgundy purple eyeshadow looks I
think that's very pretty this is nice so
I'm just going to kind of blend it into
the other color so there's a nice little
transition going now it's time for the
primer and this was so expensive this is
especially primer I'm going to try and
say any of these fancy names because I'm
a dumbass bitch when it comes to
pronouncing things so this one was 220 I
actually got all of these expensive
products just for this video so
hopefully guys appreciate that I'm just
going to give it a good shake and put it
on the back of my hand oh it's like a
gel consistency smells like tea tree oil
so I'm just going to start working this
into my skin I feel so refreshing on my
skin mmm all that's really bad but this
is all about stunning after like five
seconds or so it gets kind of tacky
which is the thing so the foundation can
really stick to it this primary doesn't
feel on the pores or anything I'm pretty
sure it just makes the skin hydrated and
it's going to make the makeup stay on
longer okay for foundation I'm going to
use the la Prairie skin caviar
foundation if you guys haven't seen my
last video um was it my last year it was
the one before that I did a first
impression on this foundation I really
want to try it out again and just like
see how it looks on my skin for the
second time just to get a feel of lack
if I actually really love it so this one
was two hundred and seventy-five dollars
and so I'm just going to start painting
this on my face I'm just going to run
through this really quickly because I
did a whole but you want to don't want
to bleed eyes it is a really good match
to my it can push it away surplus
so my boyfriend Jonathan is taking me
away this weekend and I literally have
no idea where I'm going to London in my
hair
he's taking me away for our birthday so
I'm really excited and I have no idea
honestly was guessing all these places
in exact Nick knew but only for the
weekend so it can't be true far you're
all my friends know but they're not
telling me by the way when I mean all my
friends I would surely have like four
friends so now I'm going to take the
bask in complete coverage serum
concealer so this one's like a really
hydrating concealer so if you do have
dry under eyes then this one is great I
have the shade light and I'm just going
to cover my ugly bags what was I really
high you know what did you just blending
this out with Matt over to blend and
then to make underneath my eyes I'm
taking the Allah prairie god bless that
name in a shade translucent this is a
loose powder but some yeah most
expensive powder I have $130 American
teen this is seriously my favorite
powder brush of all times at the moment
it is the Real Techniques buffing brush
it's really dense so it really just
packs my powder on and I love that sorry
for the powder I'm going to take this
Bare Minerals bear pro foundation powder
and shade it toffee
I haven't uses before so hopefully
actually does set the face because it is
a foundation powder I did feel it before
and it's dry so oh my god nor foundation
powders boys go so blotchy I really just
want to like push my brows upward so I'm
gonna take the Garbo and Kelly eyebrow
gel yes yes and they forgot that one so
I haven't used it from before either but
this one's clear so pushing them up all
this works really well love it come on
my brows so good laughs shall we get
back to business and do onto the eyes so
I'm taking this absolute hunting talent
again and I'm just going to pick up the
fair shade that I used in my crease or
this one right here and I'm gonna blend
this from a Tagore's inner corner you
guys know the drill I was going through
my cupboard the other day and I realized
how many clothes that I buy
and I don't actually use and it made me
really frustrated so right now I'm
wearing a top that I bought so many
months ago I never wore it so you know
what I'm going to make the most out of
everything that I have probably going to
happen because I have that many clothes
but just wanted to share that with you
guys
I'm not going to buy any more clothes
unless I actually have somewhere to wear
it and of course the next shade I'm
going to take is that purple shade and
I'm just going to run this over the top
alrighty so for the inner corner I'm
going to take this beautiful shade right
here oh my god this is such a diverse
palette and are where I was going with
out but I really like it so I'm just
going to put this right here
alright yeah should pigmented so the
mascara I'm taking the a Mac extended
play gigablack lash I love this to
really separate my lashes it does an
amazing job so I'm just going to take
this in zigzag motion so it gets in
every single crevice fist before we get
any further I really need to set my face
properly because that other powder
didn't add all because it is a
foundation powder so I didn't really
expect it to but I'm just going to take
my benefit hello flawless in the shade
honey this is like my Holy Grail powder
and I'm just going to use this to set
around here because I don't mind the
rest of the face being gooey but this
area I feel like looks a bit like oily I
usually use this mascara on my lower
lashes only because holy it's so good
for lower lashes then for the waterline
I'm going to take this tied in a rim
alona this is my favorite one it's just
like it's intern color so it brightens
it up a little bit it's sort of
pigmented as well so I'm just going to
warm it up in the back of my hand
because I haven't used it in so long I
probably should have done it before
mascara like that now it's time to glue
on some lashes I'm taking these ones
from house of lashes and these are in
spellbound that's so pretty I'm just
really scared man's going to be like
really sick and how to apply it but I
like how they look they're really wispy
and deep keener on they're gone
okay so let's finish this space so I'm
going to take my Bobby Brown a bronzing
powder in the shade a medium - this one
it was $65 pretty pricey it is very red
and cool tone so I'm just going to take
a little bit on an angled brush and
lightly contour my face I've really been
enjoying warm tone contour shades at the
moment so hopefully this still looks
good it's not really my favorite anymore
but anyways let's move on to the bronzer
so I'm going to take this Marc Jacobs
Omega bronzer it is literally the size
of my head
so I'm just going to take that same
actually Nora I have a new favorite
brush for bronzer it's this one by
Inglot and it is the 3-6 bjf brush it is
for good so soft and fluffy so let's
just runs up the faces ones where of
like a warm turn so it's perfect for
what I want I'm going to go around my
hairline on my cheekbones absolutely
everywhere this bronzer is completely
matte which is definitely different to
me because I love a really glowy bronzer
but I love this ones are so much too
baked underneath my contour i'm going to
take my laura mercier translucent powder
this is my favorite for baking I haven't
found a better baking powder yet so I'm
just going to drag my Beauty Blender
under here just cleans it up I feel like
this is so satisfying to watch and I
like to dust that away pretty much
straight away just because it really
does stick to the skin and it's going to
particular soon because I have kind of a
wet face now for the blush I'm going to
take this one from the tush to dinner
now this is a doer so it comes with two
shades this one's definitely going to be
too light for me if anything I'd use
that for a highlight so I'm going to use
this shade right here which looks a lot
like orgasm by not like pink shimmery
Universal kind of shade so I'm just
going to put this on apples of my cheeks
and blend it back I feel like I can wear
a lot of blush with this look just
because the eyes are like kind of that
pinky purple color so kind of got a
theme going on well this is very
pigmented
I like this blush before we move any
further I'm going to take this bottle
and Kelly powder and cream contour kit
and I'm going to take this banana Sh
it's been on a shade here because I
really want to highlight under my eyes I
feel like there's not enough highlight
going on there you know I mean
on my chin down my nose in between the
brows now it's time for the highlight
ups are as per usual
maxixe class because I use it every
single Highland anyway and then I'm
going to take this beep hello
this beautiful highlight from Beal this
is in the shade very very one and let me
tell you this better be amazing because
it was really expensive so I'm really
just going to go on in there I mean at
the start I was a bit disappointed but
once I was building it up I love it
it's like a chin tiny highlight just
like any typical highlight really I feel
like this was made to be kind of like a
natural score to the face but because I
put so much on it's like hello how are
you
feel like that's one layer ok that's
actually amazing how much of my nose I'm
going to take this Geoffrey start at the
lower lips liquid lipstick in the shade
at Gemini I don't think I've use this on
my channel and I feel like it's going to
go really well with the eye look
oh I really don't like the smell of a
sir
and then over the top I'm going to take
this nose velvet lip glide in the shade
stripped you guys know I always do ombre
lips so I'm just going to put this in
the middle this is like a messy
consistency it's really nice and then
just over the top I'm taking this
Natasha Doonan our lip gloss in the
shade 18 flesh this is going to lighten
it up even more and add a nice Sheen to
it so the wonders all messed up if you
ask me
pinky oh and then lastly I'm going to
take this touch art luminous dewy mess
spray this is actually Mary empty I do
like this one a lot so I'm just going to
spray this on the sides of my face yes
I'm going to make sure to cover my eyes
has oil in it okay so here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it it was so much fun just
like playing around with all of my
luxurious makeup and just smashing it on
my face a little one so I love you guys
and I'll see you in my next video
