channel so in today's video I'm doing a
makeup tutorial using it $2,000 worth of
products so I just had a look in my
drawers my makeup drawers and I just
picked out everything that it's super
high-end luxurious expensive and we're
just going to play around with it today
so by all means you do not need to have
expensive makeup to create a nice makeup
look or to be good at makeup that is a
hundred cent not true that's not what
the point of this video is I just
thought it'd be fun to just like play
around and see what happens so I hope
you guys like this video I got this
video idea of totty by the way she did
this that's what it was an amazing idea
so credit to you honey we're let's go
ahead and jump into the video starting
with my eyebrows I'm going in with the
Mac fluidline brow gel cream in the
shade a true brunette so I'm just gonna
fill my eyebrows in I like to do my
brows first now just so I can carve them
out with concealer just get them out of
the way I'm just going to make them nice
and bold because I'm going for a bald
like full look today
the brows are done now it's time to go
in with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer I have the shade light neutral
this stuff is incredible so I'm just
going to go ahead and carve out the
bottom of my eyebrows pickups to make
them super sharp so I just take a really
small brush and then gently draw a line
under here and this is going to cover
any like baby hairs as well and then I'm
just going to take that same concealer
and use this to prime my eyes just to
get rid of those veins that we have on
there so start by just rubbing it in
with my finger and then I'm just going
to bounce my view blender over it
I can't wait till I can get my normal
Beauty Blender this is the pro and I
much prefer just the pink one before
that dries I'm just going to go ahead
and set that concealer with a powder
this is the Rimmel stay matte powder
this is so affordable but I had to use
it in this video it is amazing now it's
time the eyeshadow so I'm taking this a
violet Voss holy grail eyes shadow
palette it is absolutely stunning sorry
the first shade that I'm going to take
is this one right here called a
transition so this is just a medium
brown shade and we're going to work this
into the crease just start off the
eyeshadow look I'm just taking this from
side to side just for a light wash of
color here now going in with this color
right here I'm using this in my crease
again we're gonna add some pinky purple
in there this color is so intense so you
want to be really light handed with it
see look at that like whoa just taking
some more of that transition shade I'm
just going to blend out any edges just
with a clean blending brush now going in
with this color right here this one is
going a little bit lower than the pink
shade so I'm going to start working this
right in this socket right there
I'm just going to take a small blending
brush and start working there in
and then taking that same at crease
color I'm just going to pack this all
over my lid I'm like really pale right
now I just turn the exposure up so you
guys can really see what's happening
just going to pack this down with my
finger actually might use a brush this
brush is a zoeva two three four amazing
for packing on color moving on to the
face so I'm going to take this wire cell
face moisturizer this one is $198 I have
never owned a moisturizer this expensive
in my life I've been using it for about
two weeks just a little bit on two weeks
and I have been completely obsessed with
it the smell alone smells so luxurious
my skin is just so hydrated and just
feels absolutely beautiful but $200 oh
that's expensive now going in with the
jelly rose water balancing mist
I use this every morning and night I
love it so much it just makes my face
feel really refreshed and refined and
beautiful Oh amazing icon even and then
to prime the face I'm taking the Giorgio
Armani Armani primer so this one is like
over a hundred dollars it has to be real
good to be that expensive so I will keep
you guys updated on what I think of this
primer like at the end of the day in the
description box if you guys are
interested see how this works but smells
absolutely beautiful have like a nice
aurora's scent to it feel like my face
smells so good right now because like
all of these products I'm putting on
ahh-choo bar about 2 K kit now it's time
for the foundation so the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation is the most
expensive one I have 95 dollars oh this
is nearly empty which is really sad
about because I have to spend another 95
dollars
I love it so incredibly much I'm just
going to use a darker shade too much my
neck I would say this foundation is like
a medium to full coverage if you build
it up it has a really nice finish it's
like a nice glowy natural finish but
still covers everything you want to
cover
the color match is a little bit off to
my fake tan but when we finish the rest
of the makeup it all comes together
really nicely I just find it so
satisfying matching my face and my neck
because the color difference is like
real now going in with the makeup
forever full cover concealer this stuff
is so incredibly thick going to shake it
up because it's separate sometimes I'm
just going to do one eye at a time just
in case it dries up because I do have
purple eye shadow on I'm making sure to
go really full coverage under the eye
because I don't want it to look like I
have a black eye I'm just going to clean
up this line right here as well with my
concealer I don't want the line to be
too sharp I still want it to be nice and
clean it's funny because like all these
products like sitting in my drawer and I
never reach for them but they're
actually pretty damn good and then going
in with my Mac of prep and prime in the
shade of black goose this is just a
highlighting 10 so I'm just gonna put
this on the high points of my face to
make it look really highlighted because
I loved that intense life intense
highlighter tense contour you know and
again just using my Beauty Blender to
blend this all again my god it just adds
so much dimension to the face it's like
everything yeah now time to set that
concealer down in place so I'm taking
the Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder I've gone through two of these
and they are pretty expensive
um the airspun powder is like a
drugstore alternative it is really good
as well but I just prefer this one so
I'm just going to put a little bit in
the back of the lid and we're gonna bake
but if we before you do that you want to
make sure there's no creases under the
eyes otherwise the creases are going to
set and stay there after you bake and
going the baking I put so much of this
on to set the rest'll girl and I dropped
it to set the rest of the face I'm going
to take the knives translucent powder in
crystal it looks like this to be honest
I really don't like this product like if
you swatch it there's like nothing
just going to lightly Pat this on my
skin feel like I have to use a lot
otherwise it's literally just not going
to do anything at all I just want to
make sure my foundation isn't sticky
that's what we really need here now I'm
going to take the Natasha - no no Gullu
this is for all over the face and the
body so it just looks like a highlighter
but since it says for all over the face
I guess I'm just going to go in I just
want a nice glow in my forehead so I'm
just gonna dust that over I definitely
can see a nice like glow
it's adding a little bit of a white cast
I'm also just gonna add this my cheeks
right here wiggle that actually is
really pretty let's go ahead and finish
off the eye so I'm going to take that
same crease color that dark purple color
and I'm going to put this on my lower
lash line from the outer corner to the
middle oh boy so I'm going to make this
quite intense and I'm going to connect
the darker color with this purple up
here and then going back in with this
pinky a purple shade I'm gonna put this
directly under that purple just so to
blend it out a little bit I'm also just
gonna blend this area right here with a
blending brush because I want to sharp
line never done this before so I'm kind
of scared it's just going to go
everywhere look like a mess
I'm just taking a very light hand I
thought actually is pretty good now
taking this beautiful Natasha dinner
eyes shadow palette I'm going to pick up
this shade right here and this is going
to go from the inner corner to the
middle of the lower lash line for a pop
I love the full kind of color so that's
what I'm inspired by today so I'm just
going to take this little brush right
here and I'm just going to spray some
fix+ on this brush to make it very
intense this would definitely have to be
the most expensive eyeshadow I've ever
heard of but the quality of the shadows
are like on a nozzle level I
are just so pigmented creamy buttery oh
the colors are just so stunning and
unique I just don't have one bad thing
to say at all and then for the brow bone
I'm going to take this shimmery shade
right here I'm just going to lightly Pat
this directly under my brow since most
of the eye shadow is matte I just
thought I would put a touch of shimmer
up here for mascara I'm taking the a Mac
a false lash Maximizer so I'm pretty
sure this is kind of like a primer to
the lashes it makes them extra long when
you put mascara on top so it's just like
a white substance let's just go ahead
and coat lashes it definitely is making
them a lot thicker never used it before
this is interesting
I haven't used this mascara in so long
it is the Urban Decay perversion mascara
are you still love it so much so this
one has like a really fat wand it makes
her lashes like humongous so I'm just
going to go ahead and coat my lashes
with some surprise it's not like off you
know what it probably is off I'm pretty
sure you have to like replace mascara
every six months whoops I've had this
for a year now lining up my upper lash
line with the Kat Von D minor it's very
lively
now going in ways it lashes I'm going to
take these ones right here I want a
really long pair since we have a lot of
dark going on on the eyes by the way I
really love that Kat Von D liner the
felt on it is like really thin so it's
like so easy to apply we are finally
nearly finished the eye area so last but
not least I'm going to take the benefit
gimme brow to set my brows down in place
so I'm going to brush them the front
ones forward to make it look a bit more
full and the rest of them just straight
down now for contouring I'm going to
take the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit I hardly ever use it so I'm kind of
excited too so I'm just going to pick up
these shades right here I do remember
this palette being very pigmented so
making sure to tap that off that's right
under my cheekbone to define it
naturally have pretty hollow cheekbones
I'm not going in for more cuz I go
always go overboard so I'm just going to
blend upwards now for the bronzer I'm
taking the hourglass a radiant bronze
light bronzer on this little fluffy
brush I'm just gonna lightly start
bronzing up the face this stuff is again
so pigmented you go to your care for
this I don't reach for this one all the
time it is really pretty but I know I
feel like there's better ones out there
that aren't as expensive as this and of
course I'm going to bronze around my
hairline I love a bronzy look as you
guys probably know by now I never missed
this step and then for blush I'm going
in with the hourglass and mood exposure
lightening blush this one is really
pretty it has like a nice Sheen to the
cheeks as well so it acts as like a
little bit of a highlighter on my bottom
probably I break this but this is
intense
now time for highlighter I am excited
about this one so I'm just gonna take a
my and it stars via a 23 brush this is
the best highlighting brush in the
entire world and I'm just going to spray
some mac fix+ on the brush so the
highlighter we put on over top is like
really intense the highlighter that I'm
using is the Becca in the shade
moonstone
this is what it looks like absolutely
stunning I hardly ever use this so let's
put it to the test shall we oh yeah so
pretty I'm also going to put this on the
tip of my nose in my Cupid's bow now I'm
going in with the Urban Decay 24-hour
lipliner and the shade - oh I love these
lip liners they're so creamy and easy
use obsessed I have like every shade as
well yes
now I'm taking the Charlotte Hillary
lipstick in the shade and very I haven't
use a shade but it looks so pretty in
the bullet it's like a really deep dark
very Brown so let's go ahead and apply
this oh my god so buttery you definitely
have to put a lot of coats on for it to
be like really opaque I wouldn't say
that this is the nicest formula or
lipstick just because it is a tiny bit
patchy and you'd want any dark lipstick
to be like super opaque but I would
prefer like math or something like that
because those ones like extremely
pigmented but now I'm going in with the
mac lipglass to add a really nice shine
to the lips the self is so glossy oh and
lastly and going in with the urban decay
at chill and makeup setting spray in
cooling and hydrating I'm going to douse
my face in this hmm
it feels so nice I'm going to go in with
another color on my lips to show you
guys what it looks like because I think
this other color will look really pretty
let me show you so this one's from
Charlotte Tilbury as well and it is
called a very Victoria so I'm gonna put
this on and I'll be back to show you
what it looks like so here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did please give
it a big thumbs up and also let me know
down below what lip color you like that
I definitely like this one more I feel
like it's just a little more wearable
and it's not as grungy so yeah as I said
at the start of the video you don't have
to have expensive or luxurious makeup to
be good at makeup or to have pretty
makeup see it was just like a little
experiment I hope you guys have an
amazing day and I will see you in my
next video
