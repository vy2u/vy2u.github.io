channel so let's go ahead and jump
straight in I'm going to start with my
eyebrows as I always do so today I'm
using a brow pomade this one is from its
heart it works really well super
pigmented and easy to light on those
brows so I'm pretty much just making my
arch higher my brows a little bit longer
and just carving them out to make them
look super neat so right usually I use
an eyebrow powder but today I thought I
would change it up and I really like how
it turned out I had to pluck a few stray
hairs and girl this gets me every time
to carve out the brows I'm taking my top
shape tech concealer this one is so good
for this step just because it is it's so
high coverage so I'm just going to make
sure the brows are super neat and then
I'm going to use it to prime my eyelids
as well to get rid of any veins so when
you prime your eyelids and make sure you
always set the base down with a powder
just so it's not sticky when you put
eyeshadow on top so to do that I'm
taking my Rimmel stammer and I'm just
going to dust this all over my eyelids
now it's time for the eyeshadow so I'm
going in with this morphe palette this
one is the 35 our I just received this
one and I'm obsessed so I'm going to
take a medium brown shade and I'm just
popping this directly in my crease so we
can start the crease with a little bit
of warmth so I'm just taking that on my
Mac 2 to 4 brush and then I'm going to
take this beautiful rich chocolate brown
and I'm taking that on a sigma e25 a
blending brush and just working this
from outer corner to inner corner this
brush is so good to really define the
crease but also blend at the same time
so I'm going to go in with that lattice
shade and blend over the top to make
sure there is no harsh lines at all and
then it's time to make the cut crease so
going back in with that tarte concealer
i'm just going to cut the crease gel
this is the part that takes the longest
I would believe for at least for me so
I'm just taking a small kind of like
concealer brush and trying to make it as
neat as I possibly can then I forgot any
to add more affectionate brown on the
outer corner so we could have the other
colors kind of like blend into something
so is taking that same letting brush and
working it in their gel now it's time to
set that concealer to make sure it's not
too sticky just using my Rimmel stay
matte and then it's time for the glitter
this part is so exciting so this is a
really beautiful like aqua blue so I'm
just going to pop this on my inner
corner so it can kind of see from this
really beautiful blue to the next color
that we're going to use which is this
green color right here so this one is
going on the middle of the lid and I'm
going to try my best to keep this
underneath that line so the cut crease
is still very neat so just take your
time there's no rush now I'm going to go
back in with that Brown and kind of like
blend the glitter and the brown together
so there's a really nice gradient this
part was really hard because the glitter
is kind of wet I tried anyways that
let's move on to the glitter liner
I'm taking this one from Urban Decay and
I'm just going to line over that cut
crease so it is as neat as it can
possibly get now going in with this
Tarte
primer / highlighter I didn't realize
how lovely this is going to be on my
face but it was really pretty it was
just like really intense so let's go
ahead and move on to the foundation I'm
going to take the urban decay foundation
oh my god this one is so high coverage
it looked so cakey on me which we were
really disappointing I've run the users
a few times and I didn't hate it but I
think this is a time where I really
hated it like it just did not work on my
skin this was the only one that was kind
of light enough for me although it was
very yellow but my natural skin tones
are very yellow so it kind of worked out
so I went in with a few blenders to make
sure all of the streaks from the brush
will gone considering this foundation is
so thick anyways let's move on from that
so going back in with that tart
concealer I'm sure you guys are supposed
to give me using this products but
there's honestly nothing better than
this like I'm so sorry so I'm just going
to blend that out underneath my eyes to
get rid of any discoloration and i'm
using the morphe sponge that is perfect
for cleaning up the eyeshadow line as
you guys can see this is going to what i
love it we always need to set that
concealer so I'm taking the
makeup studio translucent powder and
just popping that underneath my eyes to
make sure there is zero kruseman binky
now I'm going in with the powder this
one is from bareMinerals
this was literally the lightest powder I
had and it was still too dark for me
like you're joking and right so I'm just
going to pop this all over my face holy

I need something pop shut up Charlie yes
let's go ahead and finish the eyeshadow
so I'm taking that chocolate brown color
once again and taking it from outer
corner all the way to final corner for
the mascara today I'm taking me to faced
at better than sex mascara this one is
very good at volumizing at the lashes at
this point I hated how my makeup looks
because I was so pale and I know it sure
I couldn't do it so I'm like I don't
even know if I'm gonna post there so I'm
just like stop it I'm going to keep
going and see what it looks like at the
end and I kind of like how it turned out
so now with bronzer I'm taking my and my
C bronzer this one is incredible even
when I do have tan skin it works so well
so I'm taking this under my cheekbones
and also around my forehead as well just
with a pretty light hand but I still
like to be bronzed even if I don't have
a fake tan on okay so now it's time for
the blush I'm taking this new one from
Mac this one's in the shade blush baby
it is so pretty I just got the other day
so I had to try it out and I really like
the color so next I'm going in with
highlighted this one's from a color pop
in the shade stole the show it is so
pretty I think it's the first time I've
used it actually and I was very
impressed it's kind of like a natural
glow to the face because it doesn't look
powdery it kind of looks like a cream
and it literally feels like a cream but
it works like a powder it's stunning now
I'm going to take an old favorite on my
lips this one's the spice lip liner by
Mac it is so creamy and easy to use I
think I've literally use half of it
which is a record for me because I never
actually finished makeup because they
have so much so just outlining my lips
and then going in with the urban decay
lipstick in the shade up tight
usually this is a light nude on me when
I have a tan on and I put this on of
like holy crap this is so dark so I went
in over the top with my dose of colors
lip gloss to really lighten it and it
looks so much better and besides I love
having glossy lips anyway because it
just for
so much more attention to it I get a lot
back so largely I'm just going to pop on
some lashes because no look is complete
point out both lashes these ones are
really small just because I wanted all
of that glitter to kind of show through
I don't want to like take the spotlight
away thinkI anyway here we have the
finished makeup look I really hope you
enjoyed it if you do that please give it
a big thumbs up I love you guys so much
if you're wondering why I sound like a
man that's because it is 10 o'clock at
night okay I think I'm due to go to bed
oh I love you guys so much
NL see you in the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
