I'm doing a QA I haven't done one of
these videos in the longest time q and
A's are my favorite videos to watch
because I feel I can get to know someone
on more of a personal level so I just
had a massive V and I have so much
energy right now I feel like I can just
go on the dance floor like break it down
for like 3 hours straight but before I
do that let's do this Q hey I asked you
guys to ask me questions on Instagram we
have so many here so let's go ahead with
the first one and that is have you ever
made out with a girl no I have never
like hooked up with a girl I've kissed
like my friends you know when you're
drunk just having good time you're like
wow that's all I've done with like
probably like six seven girls I call
Mike really close friends I don't think
of it as a big deal at all um it's just
something normal to me oh my god I have
a question here that says have you ever
farted in an aisle and then walked away
because it smells so bad
people ask the best questions honestly I
feel like people look at girls and just
think very far they don't poop we do
honey well least a high do and I'm not
ashamed to admit that I drew fluff quite
a bit so yeah of course I've done that
we've all done that come on just quickly
I want to say thank you so much to best
fiends for sponsoring this video
I'm sure you guys have heard about this
app on the online world everyone and
their mums are playing it I swear but
you guys know I would never promote
anything that I don't genuinely love or
play so it is a free app I'll leave the
link down below if you guys are
interested in downloading it so
basically what best things is is a
puzzle adventure game where you collect
an upgrade characters by matching
colored objects to defeat the slugs I've
been playing it for about six months now
and I'm on level 80 I have so proud of
myself so best things is doing a
treasure hunt where 15 items will be
hidden in the game and if you find all
the items you'll unlock a new character
or gold and diamonds if you already have
all the characters so to find all of the
clues your treasure hunt make sure to go
over to Best Fiend Facebook page and
before you get started you can get a
bonus clue by watching this new best
fiends video I'll leave it in the
description
below it features Kate Walsh the hint is
look for her slippers in the video and
try and find them in the game so let's
go ahead and continue with the questions
the next question is what kind of drunk
are you so I know there's a lot of
different categories that you can be
like my mum no offense but she gets like
kind of emotional sometimes not all the
time too sometimes there's like
talkative drunk says drunk sat on that
talkative that are kind of quiet but
there's been one time where I've been
really emotional really upset and that's
when I had Jim Beam like bourbon and I
was like crying in my room while it was
my mom's 40th birthday it was honestly
horrific my mom was like come out now
the speeches are on like you've got to
do your speech those like it was
honestly so bad so I'm staying away from
Jim Beam it's disgusting anyway but
other than that I'm just I don't know
really talkative like loud probably
annoying just usual like what is the
most uncomfortable situation you have
been in I would say the most
uncomfortable feeling that I get is when
I'm in a group setting if I'm with like
a bunch of people that I don't really
know when I have to like publicly
publicly speak oh I get so awkward I
literally turn into another person it's
like sometimes I get really bad social
anxiety sometimes I'm completely fine to
be around people and be loud and happy
and chirpy and stuff it's just sometimes
when I feel like a little bit off oh I
get so awkward and uncomfortable and
it's happened a lot of times like when I
was with my boyfriend's family will
literally just sitting on the table
playing a board game it was my turn and
I was like what a girl I literally just
walked out of the room I was so
uncomfortable like I was getting
uncomfortable the could weirdest times
ever
speaking of uncomfortable situations
last week something happened that really
really bothered me and I feel like it's
interesting to share with you guys
because it's so laughable okay so
basically what happened my friend sent
me a screenshot of a bunch of girls
packing about me I can't even say that
word I'm completely fine with girls not
liking me because you don't have to like
every single person that's just life
that's just how it works I'm fine with
that within this one girl commented on
this photo and say
one time I went up to shiny into a club
and she said to me I've got people to
see and places to go and then went up in
their face like that is literally the
biggest lie I've ever heard and I was
just so shocked that some people
actually go to the extent of making
things up to make me look bad
I scroll down she has another comment
and I'm like really it says that one
time I was in a shopping center I put my
sunnies on so no one would come up to me
I was rude to anyone that was trying to
help me and I was like Chloe like go get
my okay for my stuff I'm not paying for
it so anyways I message this girl and I
was like why are you making up life
without me like people do this all the
time I'm so sick of it it's embarrassing
like just stop doing this and the
message above was her like hey babe just
wondering if I can bias and like jeffree
star products off you like being all
nice to me but then she goes publicly
and just writes all this about me I
don't know I found that really
entertaining so I really wanted to share
that with you guys but correct me up I
just so you guys know I would never
treat any of you like that
every time I see you guys we start we
take photos we chat sometimes it's
quicker than normal sometimes we stay
there for a while and talk it just
depends on how I don't know how we're
clicking how the atmosphere is going but
I will always be nice to you guys so
please if you ever see anything like
that just don't even look twice at it
the next question is what is one
annoying thing your boyfriend does that
you don't like enough so sorry Jonathan
if you're watching like seriously every
time I say it to him he gets so mad but
you know when that you're talking to
someone you can really hear when they
like like you can just hear their mouths
like kind of dry
oh no but every time he does that and
every time notice I'm like what do you
want like do you want a drink of water
cuz it's really irritating and I'm I do
it all the time as well like literally
everyone does it but it's just something
for some reason I pick up all the time
when he talks all the time love you John
the next question is do you find being a
youtuber has made you gain confidence in
yourself 100% if you guys knew me in
high school it's literally like a
completely different person I was just
such a quiet child ever since I came out
of the I was
hey these are your sugar rules you can't
say stuff like that
ever since I came out of between your
legs I was very shy withdrawn I excluded
myself from a lot of conversations and I
always found it really hard to make
friends but ever since I started YouTube
I definitely have gained a lot of
confidence I guess it just took me a
while to realize that we're all on the
same page we're all only human no one is
above anyone else not even Beyonce is
above anyone else we're literally all
Beyonce is okay so once I realized that
I just became more confident in talking
to other people and just happier and
that is where confidence comes from I
think so yeah I've never been more
confident and I hope you guys feel the
same as well you guys are beautiful and
amazing one thing that I want you guys
to take seriously is to always stay true
to yourself and what you believe in and
always be yourself no matter who you are
around I have a group of friends that
are like I don't know how you post
photos like without makeup and videos
and snapchat being all weird and
whatever and I'm like because that's
just who I am that's my personality I'm
a very weird person I feel like everyone
is weird deep down and you don't have to
change for anyone the last question that
we have here is have you ever had trust
issues in a relationship before so I
personally haven't and I feel like that
would suck really bad to have trust
issues because Trust is like the most
important thing in a relationship so
everyone that I've dated I've dated to
people like seriously and both of them
have never done anything for me to think
that they're up to anything they've
never like cheated on anyone else I've
never like spoken to girls when we've
been dating so I don't have a reason to
have trust issues I feel like if your
boyfriend has cheated on you before or
you've called them talking to girls
that's when it's gonna be really really
hard so it's like so bad but I'm just
glad that it hasn't happened to me I
hope never does and I hope you guys
haven't had to experience trust issues
in a relationship because it just kills
me thinking about it I feel like people
make out that relationships I just saw
it complicated and high but if two
people love each other and they trust
each other there's like no problem
really
there's like little arguments but that's
normal yeah I mean but anyways guys
there we have my Q&amp;amp;A I feel like you
guys now know a lot of personal things
about my life and I hope you enjoyed it
the
I'm a very open person like usually I'm
a really open person but for the past
like year or something I've really liked
taking a step back because obviously my
audience has like grown a lot and I'm
really like self-conscious of like what
could hurt people with what I say or
like my opinions hurt people so I try
and keep really quiet a lot of the time
I'll always be myself but I feel like I
kind of have to filter myself and keep
it like PG on my channel um just to be
safe but I feel like this video was
personal so I hope you guys liked it
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
