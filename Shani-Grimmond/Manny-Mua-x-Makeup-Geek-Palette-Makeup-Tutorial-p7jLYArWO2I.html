black smokey eye today so the first
thing I'm doing is taking my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot as per usual
I'm just priming my lids to cover any of
my veins because they have that so many
and then of course I'm just going to set
that with a little bit of translucent
powder so the other shadow is blend
really nicely on top now taking my
makeup geek many MUA palette and picking
up the shade at beaches and cream which
is kind of like a light skin tone shade
I'm just going to put this in my crease
to kind of make it seem a little bit
bigger because my crease is tiny so just
taking that on a really fat blending
brush and just taking in windshield
wiper motions now with the shade Sora it
is a few shades darker I'm just going to
add this in my crease once again and
it's just going to add even more
definition so what I like to do is start
with lighter colors and make my way to
the darker shades just so it blends like
really seamlessly and so it doesn't look
too harsh now taking the shade Aphrodite
and Mars I'm going to mix these two
shades together on a smaller blending
brush and I'm just going to put this
from outer corner to inner corner so
really making it dark and intense but
make sure you don't take too much on the
brush at a time otherwise it can get
really really hard to blend out and of
course for my favorite part is cleaning
up that eye shadow to make it look super
crisp so for the black eye shadow I'm
using makeup geek corrupt it is the most
pigmented black eye shadow I've ever use
so just laying this all over my lid and
I would recommend doing your eyes before
your foundation if you are using any
sort of glitter or really dark
eyeshadows just because it is easy to
like clean up that line and it is easy
to pick up the full outfit goes under
the eyes which is so annoying
so again just blending it out blender
blend now with my Too Faced glitter glue
I'm just going to pack this all over my
lid with a little brush and then I'm
going to go ahead and put some black
glitter all over my lid so to see ek
glitter it's like pure black it's
beautiful but I did experience a lot a
lot of fallout so if you guys know of
any
a good glittery brands a please let me
know and then taking my little baby this
is my Nivea man that sensitive per se
bum I'm using this as a pram I just put
it all over my face and honestly this
makes my makeup stick like glue so thank
you nikkietutorials for introducing this
to the YouTube world I love it
and now for my ride-or-die foundation
this is my Too Faced Born This Way I use
the shade warm beige and it matches
absolutely perfectly to my fake tan so
as you can see right now my fake tan is
looking a little bit green because I put
so much on and it's still developing so
don't mind that but this is the closest
match to my fake tan and the coverage is
amazing it feels so light on the skin
and it just has the most beautiful
finish the brush that I'm using with it
is the zoeva 1:04 buffer and these two
work together like you would not believe
I love this combination I feel like I'm
using all my favorite products this is
another one this is the Urban Decay
Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
I'm going to shade light neutral just
putting this in the usual areas to
highlight and you can't slap the
discoloration and I feel like a Beauty
Blender is the easiest way to blend out
concealer because it makes it look so
seamless and it picks up any excess
product that might be left behind and
then whipping out my hardest contour
palette I'm taking the yellow banana
shade and just setting under my eyes
with this to be honest after I've used
my Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder I can't really go back to banana
shades because it just doesn't work the
same I feel like it doesn't set the
concealer as well so yeah I went and set
the rest of my face with the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder and I
think I'm going to use this under my
eyes like everyday for now on just
because it works so well now taking
Soraa on my lower lash line from inner
corner to outer corner just to really
smoke it out because the top lid is so
dramatic I want to make the bottom just
as dramatic so it kind of balance it out
then taking Aphrodite and Mars and
running that directly on top
then with my tart in the rim liner I'm
just going to line my waterline because
I do have a small eyes I like to keep
the waterline nice and bright to keep
them awake for mascara I'm going to take
the benefit a roller lash and just coat
my top and bottom lashes to prep them
for falsies for the lashes today and
using the hooter beauty links collection
in a style Brigitte these are honestly
my favorite lashes ever I have never
loved a lash so much in my life oh yeah
I need to get more so for the brows I'm
taking my inner stars you're like brow
whiz or something it's one of the new
ones and I did not like it at all so I
had to go in with my normal essence
powder just to make it more sharp
because I just didn't feel like it was
working for me it was too hard and it
wasn't making my brows look sharp for
the highlight I'm taking the makeup geek
eyeshadows in white light and vanilla
bean I'm just putting this directly
under my eyebrow and why do I use makeup
Eagle time because I love it I'm sorry
now with my Australian my brow brafton
I'm just going to run this through my
brows to add some texture and also to
lighten a little bit because I do go
over the top a lot of times I used to
use this stuff religiously but then I
got my brows tattooed on and I just
rediscovered it again and I'm like why
they ever stop using you now it's time
to contour with that same palette the
TARDIS palette so I started off with the
lighter shade and honestly worked so
incredibly well and I was like oh maybe
I should make it more intense so I took
the darker shade and it made it a little
bit muddy so definitely would stick to
the latter shade if you have my skin
tone for bronzer today I'm taking my
hourglass a radiant bronze light bronzer
and I'm just going to pop this around
the whole perimeter of my face and also
on my cheekbones to look super bronzy
and Sunkiss like I've been out in the
Sun a week but really a haven't seen
eternal week
now to add a nice flush of pink to my
cheeks I'm taking the Milani baked blush
in the shade 0-2 so just putting this on
the apples and blending it all the way
back for my highlighter I wanted to try
something a little bit different so I
took my sparkling dust by Inglot in the
shade 0-2 when I first put it on it was
a little bit chunky but then I decided
that I needed like a more of a fluffier
not as dense brush and it worked so so
much better it was super pretty and
intense so just putting this on my
cheekbones and down the center of my
face for that glow also to make my face
look a little less powdery I took my
Urban Decay long lasting setting spray
and just smash my face with that full
lips today I'm taking the two-faced lip
liner in the shade perfect nude so I'm
just lining my lips and oh my gosh I've
been using the stuff so incredibly much
because it matches so many pinky shades
and so many nudie shades and the formula
is just beautiful as well so for the
lipstick I'm going to go ahead and take
the buxom lipstick in the shade so this
is just going to go all over my lips and
then I will take a lighter nude shade in
the shade buff and pop that right in the
middle to make my lips appear a bit
bigger and just have more dimension and
last but not least I'm taking my buxom
full-on lip cream in the shade White
Russian and just popping this right on
top and I didn't have it in the frame
which was so annoying
look at that lash but yes there we have
the finished makeup look I hope you guys
loved it I think it's so incredibly
pretty if you did like it please give it
a big thumbs up because it helps me out
so much and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and I'll see you very soon
