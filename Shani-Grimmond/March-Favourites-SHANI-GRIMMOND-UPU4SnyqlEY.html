my channel so today I'm doing my March
favourites March was an amazing month
for me it was my birthday at turn 19 I'm
a big girl now yeah it was overall a
really good month even though I've been
sick half of it with bronchitis and a
chest infection but other than that it's
been really good I have a lot of new
favorites to share with you a lot of new
discoveries so let's go ahead and get
started first of all this song I've been
completely obsessed with ever since I
first heard it I was just like this is
the best song I've ever heard so let's
just put it on so you guys know what I'm
talking about so that's all that's
called I hate you I love you and
honestly I've never been that obsessed
with a song in my life so just thought
I'd share it with you guys in case it's
kind of like a downer but I just have
voice everything everything well my next
favorite of the month is this new watch
from the brand Christian hole it is so
stunning and sleek so this one has a
marbled face to it and I chose like the
light pink band that comes with it my
favorite part about this watch is you
can buy separate bands for them to
change up the color that it basically
looks like you've got 500 different
watches in one because I have quite a
few bands down here this one would have
to be my favorite color and then I also
have a black one which obviously it's
going to go with everything and then we
have a dark brown shade as well so I'll
just show you how you can change it
because honestly takes few seconds so
there's just like a little silver clip
right here and you pull it to the side
and it comes right up and then to put it
on you pretty much do the exact same
thing so you line up the rod and you
pull that little silver thing to the
side I don't have nails and you just
clip it right in like that I have a
watch that I want to give away to you
guys if anyone is interested I have at
this one right here it has the checkered
face on it
with the dark ten and sorry if you guys
are interested in this leave the word
chickens leave the word chickens down
below in the comments and I will choose
someone to send this off to and I'll
message you when I choose a winner time
up for some makeup favorites this one
would have to be the best one of the
month this is the makeup geek
many anyway palette this is so stunning
I've been using this so much the past
month and you guys would have knows that
because it's been in like every single
makeup tutorial so I think the shades
are amazing there are so many different
looks that you can create with it I
think a lot of people a lot of people
have been using at this bottom row when
they've been making like doing tutorials
and stuff on YouTube and they're just so
different and so unique and I just I
love them so much especially this one
right here it's like a green but when
you change lights it goes to like a
purpley shade it's just an makeup geek
eyeshadows are my favorite brand as well
because they just blend out so
seamlessly so I mean appellate couldn't
get any more perfect I mean come on
next we have two perfumes I like to keep
my perfume collection really small I
don't know why I just have like a really
key key it has to smell like really
really really good and I find that
really hard to come across but these two
are amazing the first one is called
product candy I got the rollerball so I
can take it in my bag and I thought it
would be good but traveling and stuff so
let's see what this one smells like cuz
I forget oh my god it smells so good
it's kind of like a really amateur ah
sexy smell I don't really know how to
describe it you guys should go sniff it
yourselves because the next one is in
the shade the next one is cold it's her
car clip this one is like a really
feminine girly like floral scent oh it
smells honestly so incredible you guys
have to go check these ones out
let me just show you what they look like
in case you did not see a close-up it
actually comes with quite a lot of
product as well this is the one that I
didn't know how to pronounce it's very
difficult next we have a true brushes
and I've been using these every single
time I do my eyeshadow I could not do my
eyeshadow without them so the first one
is z2 g7 zoeva luxe soft assignor this
is perfect to add color into the crease
and to blend it out and make it look
seamless and the next one that I used to
blend it out even more so these two work
like the perfect blending team is called
the 2 to 8 luxe crease crease brush by
Zoe as well these two are just insanely
and they never showed on my eyes they're
nice and soft and they just work wonders
for me next we have the Anastasio dip
brow pomade I have the shade medium
brown I'm sure you guys have heard of
this one before but I used it today for
the first time in a while and it made my
brows like really easy to create a
defined like crisp line so I always like
to bring my eye about really far down
here and it's really hard to do it with
like shutters and stuff because it isn't
very harsh and sharp here and I mean so
this stuff is super easy it's like a gel
pomade consistency consistency and I
just love it I love it I love it
next we have the matte gold deposits so
I use this when I really want to bronze
up my face and add lots of shimmer to it
there is like a lot of shimmer in it
it's not really finely milled it's kind
of like bigger chunks of glitter but it
is so stunning the color is just like a
perfect bronze and I've been using this
pretty much every time I do my makeup
the next thing that is incredible and
pretty much a life changer is the zoeva
graphic eyes black to earth eyeliner
this is a waterproof eyeliner if you put
it in your waterline it will not budge
at all I'm not even kidding you I went
for a shower and I came out and it was
still on and I was like what what did i
do differently today but then I
remembered it was this beautiful
eyeliner next up we have the Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray cooling and
hydrating I may have mentioned this in
my last month's favorite I'm not too
sure but this is obviously a Savior I
use this every time I do my makeup
because I put a little powder in my face
like my Laura Mercier translucent
powders just set everything down and
then it looks really powdery so I like
to go in with this over the top to kind
of absorb all the powder and make my
face look a bit more Joey and natural
natural
I honestly this stuff is the best
definitely an essential in my makeup
collection love it the next thing that I
have is also an essential I love it so
much it is the morphe brushes brush
cleaner and disinfectant spray so when I
have an eyeshadow brush that I want to
use write that in there I don't have
time to do a deep clean I just put some
of this on a cotton pad
spray like two sprays two pumps on there
and swirl it in my cotton pad and my
brush was honestly clean straight away
so good and it dries super quickly as
well
I think it's got alcohol in it I don't
know oh my god I forgot that I have
another cent that I need to share with
you guys this stuff is incredible it is
the Victoria Secret fragrance mist this
is in passion strucked let's see what it
smells like I have the worst memory I
like forget but I knew it had to be my
favorites okay so this one's kind of
like a really light floral eagerly smell
I'm pretty sure that's how I described
the other ones I'm social can't despite
its really nice and fresh and it makes
you smell super clean and just on top of
the world I took this with me to Sydney
and I just sprayed it on me instead of
taking a perfume just because it's
easier to travel with because it's
plastic and the misting part the missing
thing on it is really good because it
comes out like everywhere love it next
thing that I have here is the Sephora
instant now polish remover so what you
do is you just literally stick your
finger in that little hole right there
you put it in a few times and your whole
nail is alike completely clean and now
polish is gone it is the easiest thing
ever and when you pull it out your hands
are dry as well so you don't have that
like oily residue left on your nails
it's honestly just the best nail polish
remover I've used and every time I go to
Sydney I pick up like 10 of these
because I don't think you can get em
online
I don't know last but not least we have
the Johnson's a face care daily
essentials and moisturize cleansing
wipes while the names have to be so long
it looks like this I find it kind of
hard to get really good makeup wipes
because some of them are too dry and
they like pull on your face some of them
are too oily and you're left with a big
grease ball on your face but this one is
like the perfect in-between fine I'm not
gonna lie they were very expensive it
was three for $15 I think makeup wipes
are like way over price but these are
good so whatever so there we have my
March favorites I really hope you guys
liked this video if you did as angel
please give it a big thumbs up because
it helps me at so incredibly much and I
will see you in my next video
bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
