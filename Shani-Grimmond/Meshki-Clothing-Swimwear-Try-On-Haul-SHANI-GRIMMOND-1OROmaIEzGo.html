channel so in today's video we are doing
a clothing haul I'm so excited for this
one because I haven't done one in such a
long time and I literally used to do
them all the time so this is gonna be
amazing before we get into this video I
have to show you something that's
literally made my whole entire week are
you ready for this oh don't be
embarrassed hello my chickens a welcome
back this is actually probably like the
best thing I've ever seen he's wearing a
chicken outfit you I just so cute he's
actually wearing it for two days
straight you know sit I feel like the
funniest thing about peanut is his head
looks like it's a cotton ball that's
exploded the perks of living alone you
feel like your dogs humans okay start in
today's video I'm doing a mesh keyhole
so I will leave everything that I'm
mentioning in this video down in the
description below and as per usual I do
have a discount grid for you guys if you
use the coupon code shiny you can get
15% off sorry as I said before I'll
leave you know are you paying on that
Wow you would never know with these dogs
okay sorry if you guys have been
following me on Instagram for like the
past six months or so you would know
that I'm literally obsessed with red
I've been wearing it so incredibly much
so of course naturally I have to get
some red Mars so the first thing that we
have here are these are really nice
high-waisted fitted pants there's a kind
of like dress pants with a slit all the
way up to like the calf muscle so these
ones are really nice and fitted at the
top and then along the bottom they kind
of flare out a little bit so I think
these with this top right here and a
pair of heels is going to look so
incredible and I'm going out on Friday
so who knows
mine even wear this outfit so this is
the top right here it has a little gold
M right in the middle which i think is
so elegant it looks amazing this is on a
lot of that clothes now and I just I
love it because it's not it's not like
you're how little brands have like the
actual brand printed out on their
clothes it's like well I'm not gonna
wear that because it just looks like I'm
wearing it spawns the top but I really
like this one because it doesn't look
like oh hey I'm wearing my feet hello
this is a free promotion you don't I
mean like it's actually really really
pretty sir yeah I love this one I have a
size small in the top and small in the
bottoms as well so just so you guys know
like what the sizing is kind of flat
this one is so cute and I'm glad that my
boobs fit in this one because there is a
little bit of room in there for the big
boobies thanks very much for you love
you and every time I pick up something
off the floor I'm pulling it out of
peanuts but beautiful okay sorry the
next thing that we have here is so
incredibly sexy and I feel like it's
giving me like Catwoman vibes or
something sorry it is a black jumpsuit
or we took a little place suit because
it has pants this is what it looks like
right here sir it's just what's at one
side yeah it's just one side that has a
cutout down here and it's like attached
by like a massive string and you can
obviously like keep it undone if you
want one leg to be kind of open and have
a bit of a flare or you can like you can
pretty much tied up wherever you want
you can go all the way down if you want
or I think on the website they've kind
of stopped it around like under the hip
bone a little bit the straps have these
little holes in it here so I feel like
it's really like grungy but sexy at the
same time which I love so it's one of
those outfits that is a really
comfortable buy really hot at the same
time which is totally up my alley
because I love anything comfortable even
when I was trying to look really hot on
my sorry I can't my that if it's not
comfortable I said in all my videos bye
it's just a truth I feel like that's the
same with like a lot of you guys beauty
is pain but um but if I'm uncomfortable
okay sir I was saving this piece to this
whole until I was gonna wear it this is
my favorite place in the whole whole so
this one is a denim blue dress I
absolutely loved the way that this one
sits on my body um it has like a little
belt in
if you want to add a belt to it as well
to kind of make it a little a little bit
more dressy or of course you can wear it
after like lunch and make it more casual
but I'm definitely in addresses one up
put some like nice hoops in as you guys
know that's all I do and then some nice
heels and like a designer back to like
pull it all together well that sounded
really bad
I do love my designer bags but they're
not everything okay and I love that this
goes all the way down to the knees
because personally I feel more
comfortable wearing it along with
dresses if it definitely is an exception
with shorter dresses but as long as the
butt cheeks aren't out I'm gonna be
happy but I just absolutely love the way
that this one says it so I'm it's nice
and tight but it's not to the point
where I'm like suffocating okay so now
we have an exception for a short dress
because it's not too short so this one
is sorry hot like sorry sexy so this one
is just literally a plain red short
dress but my favorite thing about it is
the straps like I've always had an
obsession like literally the biggest
obsession with spaghetti straps and
these ones ah but can you see them like
that's how small they are and I love it
so much it just sucks the body in really
really nicely and the material is so
comfortable I don't know what material
is actually maybe I should check I don't
think many people care about that but
like I do
nylon and spandex I don't know but this
is like one of my favorite materials to
it because it's just sort of comfortable
okay this next outfit is very very crazy
I feel like a lot of people gonna hate
this and a lot of people are gonna love
this you could just go - I just don't
feel like there's any in-between I did
have something similar to this a few
months ago and I wore it out and it
looked so cool and when you dance it
looks amazing it looks like your salsa
dancing or something look okay I should
I should really just stop but this is
what the top looks like here as you can
see this has a lot of tassels on it so
you could imagine when you're like
shaking like this it looks so cool this
one has a zipper out the back and again
it has a really thin straps at the top
here and it has the nude lining as well
and of course we have the matching
bottoms right here I was thinking it
would be really cool to wear that top
with like a denim skirt or something but
of course you can work with a mesh and
putting matching bottoms as well I was
just thinking of kind of like another
way that you could wear it and still
look incredible so this is what the
bottoms look like
right here these ones all high waisted
and have the nude lining on the inside
as well but I love anything highway said
literally anything oh my god I was
wondering what have the nude lining it's
because it's like this mesh material
it's kind of safer so you might see a
little bit of bomb which I'm like
totally down full I love that we're
gonna move on to some bikinis soon which
I'm really excited about but for now we
have another really dressy at play suit
so this one's a really bright white one
again with the M on the front here to
add a little bit more of like a little
bit more class I would say this would be
perfect with like just a lot of gold
jewelry I feel like a really big like
layered necklace would look incredible
with this sorry this one has the splits
kind of around just like the upper thigh
area and this one is strapless a zipper
at the back it is cinched in around the
waist which is always so important to me
so I'm really obsessed with this one
this one actually goes all the way to
the ground for me which is a big one as
well because I'm really tall and I need
it to go down to my ankles because I
don't have time full 3/4 jump see I mean
that's actually kind of cute but like if
it's meant to be you know what I mean I
have won this one because I could not
wait any longer I'm so obsessed of this
so this is a black Lexon II okay
I always say shiny and it sounds like
Shaunie was tripping me out
this is polyester I always think it's
like silk because it's that really
beautiful silky material it looks like
really classy sorry this one goes around
the arms here but it's not too
restrictive which is good because I hate
when you're like when you're at a club
like ranting like this because this is
where I'd wear this like if I'm going to
get drinks or something because it is so
classy but anybody like trying to ng
like can't even lift your arms and like
do the good old facepalm I'm totally
kidding that was like five years ago but
like maybe I see little bit I'm drinking
um and then yeah so it's pretty much
just like a band or the one that goes
across like this I've never been able to
say that word but then it has no
material at the front here that you can
tie like a little bar so that's really
cute and then also has these pants that
go with it and it's super high-waisted
as well so it does go about the
bellybutton which again obsessed with so
yeah this one is super cute I think
anything that has that like really
reflective shiny material shiny material
is always a winner for me okay so now we
can move on
to the mask you swim portion of this
video I've been wearing mostly swim ever
since they came out like it's pretty
much the only swimwear I've been wearing
lately I'm very very impressed with wow
I've got a stud off today that's amazing
I'm just really impressed the designs
I've never really seen anything like
this so this one is the banjo style at
the top and it kind of comes into a
little bit of a taper to this gold
symbol again absolutely love this one
it's super comfortable and now that I'm
thinking of it I feel like you could
totally wear it this way as well so
again this one's that really nice soft
material and if you guys are wondering
I'm a size of medium in these tops just
because my babies are a d-cup sir I did
go up a size for this and this one fits
perfectly so I love that one and then we
have the I've got no cabinet I'm
literally um refreshing a festival page
because I'm trying to get tickets to my
friend I just got them before and
there's all your resale at the moment so
I'm just like sitting home water
training can feel a while I'm doing this
the things that waiting for festivals in
my ranch okay sorry here we have the
bottoms right here these ones are a
thong sir if you guys don't like a lot
of three then these wouldn't be the
bottoms for you but they do have a lot
of bikinis on their website where you
could kind of mix and match because
there's a lot of red a lot of black and
a lot of white and I think there's a few
other colors like Tommy green and stuff
that's really nice but yeah this is
definitely one of my favorite set so
I've got all tangled up because I start
the tags on I don't know if there's
anything I love more in this world than
swimwear like I'm obsessed with it so
this is the next one right here this
isn't full coverage at all so keep okay
I'm literally about to throw these
earrings at the wall not happy Jen sir
as I was saying these ones aren't full
coverage at all so keep that in mind if
you don't like showing a lot of skin but
I'm obsessed with this design so much it
is a very very high waisted thong and
then it has these gold buckles on the
side with these gold like studded holes
in the back and oh my god this is
probably my favorite bikini I've ever
seen in my life and then we have the
oh my god I have this light the sort of
water make a nice eye let's put it right
here but oh my god
die that this said I mean it same as
it's been and white but like I feel it
so good with the tan and here we have
the top right here so again we have the
true buckles at the top and then all of
the gold studs at the back this is just
so cool it's so hot but so edgy at the
same time like the other black jumpsuit
I feel like the same vibe it's kind of
this or this one's like a triangle fit
sir he makes it look really good nah I
you've never been really good all
the time because like likey they're not
real
oh let me just say coming out of that
surgery room was so funny I was so high
from the drugs that they gave me like I
don't even remember it I just remember
watching a video and I was like this
costed okay so next we have a one-piece
which I absolutely love because
obviously one pieces are so comfortable
you can do backflips you can do dads you
can do bombed rides you can I'm taking
my earrings out that's what the universe
time I ever lacks all night that whole
sock off that I was just going on about
but yeah obviously you can like go to
the beach and like do not have anything
come home place so you can adjust the
front rack here you can make it a little
bit tighter a little bit looser
depending on your boob size which i
think is really good and I just feel
like this is a really cute piece it has
like the hole in the middle so you still
have like a bit of skin showing it's not
like you know I'm just like a normal one
pace so I think that's really cool the
next thing that we have right here I
also have in black as well but I'm gonna
show you guys are the maroon okay well
okay so you guys know this not addresses
that came out and like everyone was
using that like app where kurata
something I've never downloaded it but
like when you'd wear something that has
diamond cheese on it you would like put
the effect on and everything would just
like Shema this is something that
reminds me of like something inspired by
that sir it has these studs on this side
that right here I could just imagine
that at make you look even cooler it's
already so shiny especially when you're
in the Sun this is like all this pedasi
which is going insane so I personally
like to wear this one up high like this
up like high around the waist or of
course you just wear it normally if you
would like so this one isn't like it's
not a thong but it is like a little bit
cheeky the normal triangle top it of
course has that little something extra
with all the dye Monty's
down
the front and back of it right here so
this one doesn't have a tie out this one
has like the clasp at the back and then
lastly I actually haven't even tried
this one on yet I'm so excited to this
is like one of the newest ones so this
one to me looks a little more full
coverage than the rest which is
obviously cool to have a little bit of
variety in all of the styles I love how
all those styles are so different I just
want to have a little bit of a gold
detail about like some gold buttons here
and it ties up at the front yeah these
ones oh my god
oh these ones are high-waisted as well
and these are thong I have a feeling
when I have to stop going to the gym
when I don't work out on my but it gets
so let's swap II it's really kind of
keep that you know winter coat okay so
there we have the finished video I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I
absolutely love doing holes so much to
make sure you let me know down in the
comments below what other brands you
want me to do holes of again everything

great hang everything up right now

entire week and everything's just gonna
