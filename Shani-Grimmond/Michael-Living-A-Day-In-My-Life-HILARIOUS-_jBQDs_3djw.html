what happened is Michael is living the
day of Shani so I pretty much set up a
few things for him to do and I feel like
he's actually going to like kick me in
the face by the end of the day because
I'm gonna do things purposely that
really annoy him that I do and he's
gonna have to eat the food that I do
he's gonna have to use the makeup that I
do and there's a few other things so
just so hilarious or I've packed my bag
and I'm gonna go get a coffee now and
take it to him but he's not gonna like
it because I get an iced caramel latte
on skin he gets a iced
karemera an iced latte with honey and
soy milk so yeah he's heard about drink
it but like that's what he's getting so
it's gonna have to deal with it so I
