in today's video I'm doing my everyday
makeup look something that is it super
easy like no makeup makeup kind of thing
and it takes about five minutes so I
have a bunch of my makeup right here
with everything in here that I need so
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing I do before I apply any
makeup is gone with some cleanser so I
use the akil's
deep cleaning cleansing a firming face
wash I've been using this for ages now
and I'm completely in love with it and
then I always gone with a little bit of
moisturizer so I've been using these
simple kind of skin hydrating all at
moisturizing cream for about two years
now so I'm just going to pop some all
over my face about this much right here
and this just allows my like foundation
or BB cream to go on a lot smoother and
I've got really dry skin as well so got
to keep that face hydrated and then
going in with some eye cream so the
concealer under my eyes does not cling
to any dry patches also to keep away
them wrinkles so I'm just taking my
Bobbi Brown eye cream this stuff has
lasted me so long so just gently patting
that under my eyes okay so now moving on
to the base I actually haven't found the
perfect base yet I like to use BB creams
on a daily basis because I don't want to
put foundation on my face every day just
because my face will break out so I have
been using the Garnier BB pure active
and the room will be the cream put
together I have not found one that
matches my neck because I fake tan I
need something with a really yellow
undertone and I also want something that
has a decent coverage so I guess these
will just do for now I mean if you guys
know many good ones please help me out
so just putting a little bit of each one
on the back of my hand and then I'm
going in with a sigma flat top kabuki
f80 brush i use a ton of different
brushes when i do my base it doesn't
really matter so i'm just going to start
blending this into my face and to be
honest this is the only mirror that i
have so let's see how this guy
it's quite small you're just going to
dab this on my face so just starting on
the most problem areas which is around
much hip area
so as you can see the color isn't a
perfect match to my neck so I just make
sure to really blend it down but I do
like how this does leave like a really
natural dewy finish to the face because
I do have dry skin and I want that go
lowered you and if you guys follow me on
any of my social media then you would
know that I picked up a new camera and
I'm feeling with it now it's a 70 D
Canon and it's amazing it just has
autofocus which is what I wanted too so
if you can hear any like rattling noises
that's just my lens focusing but I'm
just playing around with different
settings and stuff to see what works
best oh goodness gracious love my
pimples are covered actually do you like
the products I've been using but I just
want something that matches my neck a
little better but overall it does a
really good job
time to concealer I'm taking my Urban
Decay weightless complete coverage
concealer this is a holy grail of mine
it covers absolutely everything and does
a really good job at color correcting
under the eyes this is initiate medium a
light neutral so I'm just
a little bit under my eyes
so now just going ahead and blending
this out I just like to do a little
patting motion so I don't disturb the BB
cream and also running this over my eyes
so I just had to close my blinds for the
sort of Sun in the background so moving
on to setting the concealer I'm taking
my Australis AC on to our contouring and
highlighting kit I have to do this step
just because my concealer does crease
under my eyes quite a bit so I just take
a little bit of this yellow shade and
gently dab this under my eyes and I do
take a lot of shade just so it stays
nice and bright it just makes me look a
bit more awake and I'm also just setting
this down the middle of my nose as well
to keep that nice and highlighted and
all March in and I don't set the rest of
my face with powder just because I do
like that Julie finish and it seems to
last all day without powder as well and
now moving on to eyebrows I'm taking my
whitening lightning brow bar to go this
is the darkest one I change up the brows
stuff that I use all the time sometimes
I use the essence brow kit I do want to
get the Anastasi on pencil because I
feel like that will be 10 times weaker
on like an everyday basis but I'm just
going to lightly fill my brows so
firstly I just brush through them and
then I take the middle shade right here
and just start from the tail of my brow
and just extend them a little bit and
make them a tiny bit thicker so because
my hair is quite dark I just like to
make them a little bit darker as well
and this is like the perfect color for
my eyebrows but I am doing my hair
tomorrow I'm so excited I'm just getting
a little bit of Blanc put in there
because my hairs being this color for so
long and I feel like it's just starting
to get really boring so just going to
add some color which means my eyebrows
are gonna have to be lighter
oh so as you can see when I fill in my
eyebrow really frames the face I feel
like eyebrows complete a makeup look I
I'm obsessed with eyebrows right now
okay so now for mascara I'm taking my
L'Oreal telescopic extra buck extra
black mascara this isn't a scar that
I've been loving for so many years now
now just repurchased it black v time and
I've just fallen in love with it again
so just popping that on my top and
bottom lashes depending on how much time
I have when I'm getting ready I'll
either put just a tiny bit on or a lot
on to make my eyes look really big so it
for the sake this makeup tutorial I'm
going to whack a lot on so what I do is
I start from the root of my eyelashes
and really wiggle my way up to get into
each and every lash and never forget
those bottom lashes I feel like doing
the bottom lashes really open up the
eyes I have like tiny eyes so this
really helps okay so now to add some
color to the face I either take a cream
blush and a really nice color to my
cheeks or I take a bronze up so the
bronzer that I usually use is the Mac in
the shade give me son this is a holy
grail of mine I'm sure you guys know
this before so if I do want a bit of a
tan look I'll just pop it right onto my
cheeks there and around my face and this
looks absolutely amazing but I do kind
of want a juley finish today and some
rosy cheeks so I'm taking my NYX blush
in the shade boho chic on an expert face
brush this leaves a beautiful glow if
you guys have oily skin I would
definitely stay away from a cream blush
maybe just a powder blush or even some
bronzer or something but for me I'm just
going to be dabbing it right in there
and then putting it on the apples of my
cheeks
especially this light right here you're
going to see a lot of reflection coming
off so it does look a little bit wet and
that's it a look that I love so just
dabbing this you
of course I don't want to be blending
like that because it will disturb the BB
cream I feel like this just leaves like
the healthiest glow to your skin
holy
come say hey I'm really done oh come on
it you look really good man I'm drunk
come in no seriously the Lighting's nice
hey guys
not in my in your in your definitely in
my yep that's Chloe by the way everyone
do you like my makeup it's just an
everyday yeah until ago thank you well
so much thankful I can actually hear my
camera focusing when I'm just like
sitting in silence and I'm really sorry
for in ways you guys I'll fix it I
actually got so scared when she just
came in so the last thing I'm doing is
popping a little bit of lip balm on my
lips this is the her or vanilla bean it
smells absolutely amazing I heard this
heard really good things off chanak so
so I just went ahead and got it it's
from like a natural vegan store or
something I'm not sure where what it's
called but just like a natural healthy
store that sells like supplements and
stuff so poppin that on okay so there we
have my everyday like no makeup makeup
look you definitely tell that I have
makeup on by I think it's just something
that makes you look a bit more put
together a bit more presentable I
personally don't we make up every
I actually probably wear no makeup more
than I wear makeup but this is something
that I've been obsessed with lately it's
super natural and radiant and it makes
you look super glowy so I hope you guys

last is the key compartment right here I
have things that I kind of want to hide
because I just don't want them floating
around in my bag because they look ugly
or I just probably wrote using all the
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
