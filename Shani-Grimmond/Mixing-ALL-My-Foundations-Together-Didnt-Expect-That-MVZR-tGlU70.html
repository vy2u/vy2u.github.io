in today's video I'm doing a really
weird challenge type of video so I'll be
mixing all of my foundations together to
see how it looks when I apply it so I've
seen a lot of people do this on YouTube
and I thought it'd be a really cool idea
I haven't watched one yet because I knew
I wanted to do it so I have accumulated
all of my foundation into a bunch and
now we're gonna go ahead oh my god
its construction outside of my house it
sounds like a crane just fell over but
let's go ahead and mix all of my
foundations together I honestly have so
many since this is gonna take so long
alright guys so here we have all of my
foundations I do have double ups of
shade so I just put all the shades that
I think I'll be if I did have double ups
and I do have a few stick foundations
that I'm not going to include just
because I feel like it's gonna be so
hard to mix and stuff so here we have
all of my liquid foundations so we have
so many different brands we have giorgio
armani elf natasha - no not at Regina
fnt - face oh my gosh we have so many so
let's go ahead and get mixing girl I'm
gonna make sure to mix everything really
well so we have my little mixing pot
right here god damn I'm so professional
and I'm just gonna start putting a
little tiny bit in at a time oh god
that's so watery
and of course we have the finishing
touch hello okay so I have my little
concoction right here of all of my
foundations I'm just gonna go ahead and
mix it up to be honest with you the
color actually looks pretty good
oh god it's dripping everywhere all
right so I'm just gonna start doting
this onto my face oh girl I'm just gonna
start loading this onto my face could
you imagine if this was my perfect shade
I would be sorry happy then I'll start
mixing my foundations together every
time well go that would be so dramatic
I'm just gonna go ahead and blend it in
with my Beauty Blender oh my gosh well
let's just say that coverage is as high
as it can get it's literally covering
everything and the color is so good oh
my god I'm honestly so impressed right
now well I do have a fake tan on my neck
as well so I feel like when I don't have
fake tan that's wet on my neck I feel
like this would match even better oh my
goodness I can see a few of my pimples
showing through so I'm just gonna put
another layer on in my problem two areas
now I'm gonna go ahead and carve around
my eyebrows this is the bit that I hate
the Mars cuz you have to be sorry
careful you could ruin all of your hard
work I just like took a big chunk off my
arch not happy alright let's go ahead
and do my forehead
okay so this is what the foundation
looks like it does look a little bit
cakey I think I put way too much
foundation on but I wanted a really full
coverage so that's what we have achieved
today so I'm gonna go ahead and finish
the rest my makeup to see how it all
applies over this random concoction I'm
already getting really bad laugh lines
here so I'm gonna have to bake the
absolute out of that my makeup is
done so let's have a look at the
finished result like to be honest with
you this is probably like the best my
foundation has ever looked it did dry
pretty quickly so it was a little bit
hard to blend out the concealer but
honestly everything else is just like
perfect I feel like I should do this all
the time so I'm gonna go ahead and
continue my day normally and then I'll
check back in with you guys very soon so
we can see how all this random
foundation holds up okay so it's been a
few hours now I'm gonna have a look at
my foundation to see how it looks I
don't wanna leave my makeup one for any
longer because one of my lashes is
jabbing into my eye it's so annoying
and he's gonna mix like all their
foundations together anyway it's just
for a bit of fun oh my god
what the hell this is honestly so
amazing I feel like I should mix my
foundations more often maybe not all of
them but like two of them you know what
I mean I don't have any laugh lines
which is really weird I don't know what
foundations I'm making that happen
I literally don't have anything bad to
say about it at all other than the fact
that it looked really off-color at the
start but I feel like no it's looking
pretty good anyways I really hope you
