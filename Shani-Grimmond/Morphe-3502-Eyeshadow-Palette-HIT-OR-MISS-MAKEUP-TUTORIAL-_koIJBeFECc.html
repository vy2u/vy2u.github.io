since I'm sat down and filmed a video
I'm so excited right now
so in today's video I'm gonna be
reviewing and trying out the morph e350
to pellet I am so excited about this
because the first pallet the first
morphe 35o palette was amazing I used it
literally for like two months straight
so this is what the palette looks like
it has so many beautiful warm tones in
here let me compare the first palette
for you guys okay so the top one is a
three fiber and the bottom one is three
5:02 so now that I'm looking at them
together I actually think this one has
so many nicer colors in here like holy
crap this one has so many beautiful lack
orangey cranberry rich chocolatey shades
and I'm obsessed this has to be like one
of the best pilots I've ever seen in
terms of like shades like this is the
kind of shades that I'd use on more of
like a weekly basis because I mean I
only get my makeup on the weekends so I
actually film with this palette
yesterday and it just turned into
honestly it looked so bad because the
colors that I use together like didn't
work like for example this is the color
that I used in my crease and it just
showed up so red and it looked like I
was doing like a Halloween makeup look
it was not cute at all but yeah I don't
think I'd use like the ready turns in
this palette again just because it
doesn't really suit my my whole lonk I'm
not too sure about all of these like
cranberry shades down here looks so
amazing and we have some shimmery shades
in here as well which look really nice
we could do like bronzy look so it's a
lot of different things you could do
with this let's go ahead and jump into
the review the first color that I'm
going to take is this one at right here
I feel like this is literally the
perfect transition shade so I'm just
gonna take my Mac to g4 brush and blend
it in my crease just gonna load that up
on my brush and take that in a
windshield wiper motions so first
impressions it's blending on beautifully
I love that color sorry for you guys
that dirt no I've actually been away
well I've been bad
written for the past week because I got
my full wisdom teeth taken out and I
didn't realize how painful the process
would be like to recover but it's been
six days now and I'm feeling so much
better it still hurts to smile but at
least I'm filming because I honestly
missed it so much just like sitting down
chill with you guys okay so that blended
so beautifully the next color I'm taking
is this rich cranberry chocolate color
this looks so amazing I want to do like
a really nice cranberry eye today I
haven't done that in so long and I feel
like that's like one of the most
flattering colors to put on the eye and
I'm gonna take that on an hour 39 by
morphe in the crease I'm just not gonna
take it as high as that last shade very
nice it's super pigmented oh my god I
actually love this color so much
oh my go guys this is sorry so a
few weeks ago I had a few people over
and we went out clubbing and one of my
friends literally drank like a whole
bottle of Smirnoff and he started
vomiting like in the alleyway as soon as
he got out of there about to go out to
the club and I was like babysitting him
making sure is okay because I was scared
he was gonna like vomit on his no choke
on his own vomit and literally died so
took him home in the uber he vomited in
my evo melee on my lap like literally
right next to my legs and then I brought
him home put him in the shower he
vomited in my shower oh and the point of
this story is that when I was bringing
him upstairs he literally vomited at the
front of like my apartment and the next
day the owner of left the apartment
calls me up he was like can you come
down to my room so I went down to like
the meeting room and he's like also oh
my god I know what this is about like
yesterday everyone was so loud and bla
bla and he's like
we had to clean up his vomit that was
like out on the front porch and I was
like oh my god would I literally forgot
about that like I forgot to clean up the
vomit and I got a freaking breach I'm so
angry I think I've only got like one
more warning left until I actually get
kicked out you know just a little fun
update for you guys paint responsibly
okay so I'm gonna take that original
transition shade and I'm gonna buff out
the edges so it's nice and seamless just
using a very light hand mixed up I'm
gonna take this shade right here this
one's more of like a wine turn and I
want it to be like well cranberry you
know what I mean so I'm gonna take that
same brush with that color and oh I
just picked out the run shade girl and
I'm just gonna put that in the same
place with the last one I'm gonna really
deepen it up oh yes
again taking that transition shade and
blending out those edges it is pretty
easy to blend out which is good now what
I'm gonna do is going with my top shape
tape concealer this one's in the shade
elapsed and and I'm gonna create a half
cut crease I want to do like a matte
white on the lid and then blend it out
into a black I haven't done that for sir
totally grind on do you know so there's
no white in this palette which kind of
sucks cuz that would have came in handy
a lot sorry I'm just gonna have to get
one out of a different palette I'm just
gonna take it this white out of the
original three favorite palette and pack
this wipe you can seal up I'm trying to
make this as clean as possible so I'm
just taking my time I'm actually scared
now but let's go in with the black and
I'm gonna blend this on the outer half
and blend it over the top of the white
so it has a nice little transition when
we go out I just tap that in there very
lightly it's so pigmented well we'll see
wow that is super black it kinda looks
like a skunk because it's like wider
than black hmm why don't you do
something about that I'm feeling like we
need a little bit of something on the
lid where that white is because I think
the transition between the true is like
too harsh so I'm gonna go in with this a
beautiful champagne e gold shimmery
color and lily and I'm gonna put that
over the white so hopefully it kind of
like looks a bit more transitional you
know and that'll be good to see how the
shimmery colors go so firstly I'm gonna
use it without any fixed glass or
anything just to see how pigmented it is
oh my god
it's literally not sticking at all
because I put so much um I put too much
powder and underneath okay so I'm gonna
have to get some glitter glue for this
I'm gonna take the violet a bus at
glitter glue and I'm gonna put this
straight on my ah this has a little wand
on it
alright let's try this again
that's better
really go to pack it on Wow it's showing
up very gold I thought it would be more
like Pearlie that looks amazing with
glitter glue oh my god I'm so excited
now I'm just gonna line my upper lash
line with this Rimmel eyeliner this is
the scandalised precision micro eyeliner
this one's super thin so it's really
easy to get really close to the lashes
and then for the mascara I'm going in
with the Tarte lights camera lashes
mascara this one have a really pretty
packaging I'm gonna take this in a
zigzag motion so it gets into every
single lash let's move on to the face so
I'm gonna take the bright on brights
mecca Mac's illuminating primer so this
is the first time I've used this one I'm
excited to see how these products go
we're just gonna put a bit on the back
of my hand and blend it all over a
little pea-sized wow that looks very
very like illuminating maybe I'll just
put it up here wow this reminds me a lot
of the Mac what's it called oh wait oh
my god sorry cream yes frickin hell I'm
also gonna go in with the urban decay of
vitamin infused 2 complexion to prep
priming spray this stuff feels so
refreshing on the face I have a wet pack
10 on I'm really hoping I can match this
can I ever match my foundation to my
neck anyway I'm gonna go in with the wet
and wild photo focused foundation this
one's in the shade a golden beige I feel
like this one more much very nicely so
I'm gonna give it a good shake because I
haven't used it in so long
and I'm just gonna put oh wait this
one's a spatula doesn't it yes okay I'm
just gonna pop this all over my face why
is it always flies in here every time I
film it's so annoying
alright let's
listen that's some had about what I've
been up to so last weekend I went to a
festival and I don't know if you guys
know but I'm literally obsessed with
going to festivals I love partying I
love I just love like being with my
friends and having a good time and that
was the first time but I've been to a
festival where it's fallen raining who's
 I had a poncho on I look like a
walking condom here's some photos yeah
most I'm pretty sure I was like
one of like ten people wearing a plunger
the whole entire time I didn't want to
mess my hair up but then I realized and
probably rather have messy hair Zula
time I'm gonna take the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade ten haven't
used this one ages as well sir I'm gonna
shake it up and go on in my under eye so
sorry people right now please tell me as
per usual I'm blending this out with a
Beauty Blender nothing else had ever
blend out concealer with it should be
honest wow I really miss using this
concealer looks amazing just set that
concealer down I'm gonna go in with the
Born This Way setting powder sore I just
put a little bit in the back of the lid
and I really let's make sure there's no
creases there before you see on but I
used to once and I think I liked it I
just need to make sure that it doesn't
pick up and you can see a lot when you
dust it off it feels nice and light
under the eyes which is good
the early powder that I used to set my
face is the benefit hello flawless
powder in the shade champagne if you
guys know of any powders that you love
let me know in the comments below
because I've literally been using this
one for so long now I don't like you
guys are getting bored I mean using it
but it's so good because it sets a face
perfectly I make up literally says an
all day when I use it and adds that tiny
bit of extra coverage as well which is
perfect for me because nothing ever
sticks to my nose so I can just like
pack this on right here and it looks so
good
but um it's covering like all of that
shimmer eNOS from the primer so there
was no point easing that at all
it's
for the lower lashlines sort of lint see
what color I should go in with I think
I'm gonna take this one the one that we
put in the crease owner this one right
here and then I'll go in with black
close to the lash line I'm just taking a
little pencil brush and right now with a
really smoke now with a really small
brush I'm just gonna pop this literally
on my lash line on the outer corner just
to make it a little dark I'm gonna take
this Stila smudge stick waterproof
eyeliner in the shade Alpine and I'm
going to line my waterline because I
want my eyes to look a bit bigger look a
bit baby at the moment if you ask me oh
no just turn red cuz the burgundy
eyeshadow went in there oh my god that
reminds me my merch mine and Michaels
merch is available for pre-order right
now at STL label comm sorry if you guys
don't know anything about it I'll link
the link down below if you guys want to
go look at them we have a bunch of like
short sleeve long-sleeve we have a few
crops that have like all of our Logan
Logan slogan slogans on them they're
really cool you should check them out
I'm gonna go in with the mascara again
and crap my bottom lashes and then I'll
put some falsies on and I'll be back
these ones by the brand lash warriors
these are far mink lashes they're
literally the best lashes in the world
I'm obsessed with them I destroyed the
style but they literally only touch my
eyebrows which is amazing so next we're
gonna warm up the face I really need to
get some bronze enos up in here so I'm
gonna take the Emeka max satin honor Sun
lit skin bronzer in the shade of medium
so I'm going to take a little angled
brush and this looks very cool turn so
I'm gonna be super light handed with
this really I'm just gonna put this
right here

oh my god I'm gonna bring it up nice and
high so my whole face is bronze II bet
it has like little tiny shimmers in
there so it has a nice color to it which
is amazing
they run Zeus Wow you kind of like
contours at the same time I'm also gonna
take this around my hairline as well I
want a little bit more of a warm tone
over the top but that worked really
nicely like I'm impressed
Oh bit of fake tan going on there so I'm
gonna go in with the Mac dark golden
mineralized skinfinish this one is nice
and orange just how I like it
and I'm gonna put that a little bit
higher than the last color so arrange it
off okay I'm just gonna take Mac give me
Sun this one it never lets me down love
it oh my god it's getting sorry flat oh
this is so long now it's time for the
blast shoulders what was that ooh
someone's excited I'm gonna go in with
this chichi the immaculate ombre ombre
blush collection has a color this is
what it looks like right here there's a
lot of different shades in here I'm
going to take this Coralie peachy color
right here I'm not gonna put too much on
my cheeks because there's already so
much going on in the eyes but I just
want a little bit of a pop of peach
we're just using the same angled brush
they use my bronzer
okay so I'm really excited right now
because I'm gonna use this liquid
highlighter from anastacio it's a liquid
glue and it's in the shade of Pola even
though I've set my face with powder I've
heard that it doesn't like separate the
powder and everything sorry I'm just
gonna put a little bit on the back of my
hand and kind of just like bounce this
RV my cheekbones with my Beauty Blender

makeup done by makeup my jaw and this is
what she used so I'm just gonna trust
her
all right for the best okay it did grab
on a tiny bit to the powder but good to
set that down I'm going in with the
Kevyn Aucoin de niro highlighter in
Sahara how amazing does this look oh
this is brand new so this is like an
ombre it starts later inbreds a bit
darker so I think I'm gonna use just
like the middle shade wow oh my god I
feel like I'm gonna start using this
sorry much Alex with the lighter side
I'm just gonna put this on my nerves I
would say this is kind of more like it
just a glow then like shimmer you don't
I mean it's nice something different
moving on to the lips I'm gonna take
this a radical XXL lip liner in the
shade nude I feel like a nude is gonna
look really good with this look cuz
there's so many different colors on the
eyes I feel like nothing else is really
gonna work oh this is a bit dried out oh
I love that shades so much they look
really nice all over the lips except
it's very dry so I don't know if I would
make my lips look crusty but anyways
let's move on to the lipstick we have
these hourglass a little tiny bit
lipsticks right here and we have the
shade I've never and I wish so I'm gonna
go in with I've never first and pop this
all over this is a beautiful warm Turner
it looks I'm excited to see what the
formulas like oh yeah oh that's slightly
creamy just sorry small it's like
perfect for clubbing it has a tiny bit
of a sheen in it which is nice
and then going in with the lattice shade
in the middle oh my god I love how this
makes my lips look makes it look sorry
GZ oh my god I love this color it just
makes the lips look at that tiny bit
bigger and then to set my face I'm going
in with the true face prime set refresh
three-in-one replenishing and setting
spray the name is Zoe I've never used
this I just want to make sure the
squirts is all right Wow oh sorry bean I
kicked her in the head like an like an
aerosol like it's fully like okay okay
oh holy I'm just gonna use this as
a primer from now on because it comes
out in massive chunks I'm so angry so I
just took my hair out so I can look a
little more presentable but let's do a
final review on the palette sorry
overall I think the shades and here are
so beautiful this is probably a palette
that I'd use more than any others that I
have because of the shades I just wish
there was more of like a cranberry shade
because I feel like this one turned out
so much more orange when I put it on my
eye so sad but other than that the
colors are amazing I would have to say
with these shimmery shades you
definitely have to use a glitter glue
underneath for them to be very very
opaque you definitely can use them on
their own just not over other eyeshadows
because when I put it over that white
eye shadow and the concealer and stuff
it did not stick at all and also it with
a dark shape I definitely say you have
two more so Pat it then blend it because
when you blend it the colors kind of
fade into nothing so that's the only
true major downfalls but most pilots do
that anyway so yeah I definitely don't
think I'll be going near these Reds but
everything else in here I would
definitely with and as far as
everything else on my face I'm a very
impressed I'm so excited about that
Anastacio Hilah and I look so cool
I do wish I use this as a primer and son
of a finishing spray but we learn from
our mistakes don't we so I really hope
you guys enjoyed today's video it was so
nice catching up with you all and I
missed you love you and I'll see you in
my next video bye
maybe I need to go get my nails done if
you're wondering what's going on sorry
I'm going now to get them fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
