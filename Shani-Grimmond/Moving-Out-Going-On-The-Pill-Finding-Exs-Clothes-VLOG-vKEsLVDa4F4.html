today I think I'm gonna vlog like the
next few days because I have some really
exciting news so my friend Courtney and
I were a little bit my friend Corning I
applied to move into this house and we
just got to prove like I literally just
got the phone call one minute ago saying
you've got approved and I was like oh my
god
oh my god breathe breathe actual sure
ACMA sure so yes I'm very excited so
right now I'm going to be calling
Courtney and I'm gonna tell her the big
news because I found out before she did
so let's call her taking forever my
excitement is never gonna wear off oh my
god okay
sorry hello and guess what what we got
accepted yeah he called me
oh my god how do you feel we are
literally going to start packing right
now I'm so excited yeah so the main
reason as to why I need to get rid of
these seriously
the main reason as to why I'm moving out
is because I want to move into like more
of a modern house my mom doesn't really
like modern houses because she likes to
have land for her horses so that's a B I
want to have my own filming room because
this is literally my filming space it's
so messy I'm sorry you had to see that
with them but yeah I Ramon filming room
so I have like heaps more motivation and
stuff like that and I just want to look
a lot more professional I don't know I
just I'm not happy with like what's
going on at the moment especially with
my channel like I'm not really happy
with my content at the moment so I feel
like if I marry if I have a filming room
I'm going to be so much more motivated
and things will be back on track honey
and so another thing I want to chat
about is your how my last year I'm like
you I haven't been uploading much
because things have been going on blah
blah um and you just stop saying blah
blah blah it's probably still annoying
for you guys um but yeah I having so
emotional for the last like a month and
a bit like a few things have happened
I'm like in my personal life and stuff
but like my emotions should not be this
slack off whack like they are actually
insane like I'll just start crying all
of a sudden and I just wonder I was so
emotional and I had methey so I went to
the doctor's because I was like this
isn't normal like I can't be upset this
upset over something so little you know
I mean okay so he recommended me to go
on the pill which is what I'm on right
now so basically I don't know how do I
describe this
so my doctor recommended me to get a
blood test and like a pelvis ultrasound
or something so I went to do that to see
if anything was wrong in my stomach or
whatever flop they wanted to find
nothing was wrong so he put me on the
pill and it's been me like three to six
months until my period cycle goes back
to normal because I hadn't got my period
for four months because my body shut off
my period because I've been so stressed
so that's that um someone messaged me on
the tumblr
yesterday it was like a learning a pill
just so you can have unprotected sex a
when you go on the pill that doesn't
mean you can have unprotected sex and B
no that's not why I'm going on it that's
what I got really angry with that was
with that question actually because um I
found it quite rude like people jumping
to conclusions just because someone's on
the pill that doesn't mean it is for sex
okay um so mainly yeah the mayor is
nowhere on it is because of my emotions
like they're being crazy and this one is
actually it says Estelle but that's not
the one I was supposed to get I don't I
don't really know but this one also
helps your hormonal pimples these are
all hormonal so hopefully my pimples
evacuate the premises because that
really bad moment also due to stress so
yes that is what I oh one moment saying
I haven't vlogged in ages I feel like
this is gonna be a bit rusty I really
want to get like a whole new broom set
up and everything so get new bedside
tables a new bed new quilt cover what is
my hair doing my hair was so naughty
today like I was brushing it for like
three hours yeah I'm so excited to
Wapping me that like my room is so
disgusting like how boring is that it's
so big though my room is large and in
charge in the new room that I'm moving
into is very small but I've got two of
them so it's fine you know what I mean
