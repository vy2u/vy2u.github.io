really fun festival look so I'm starting
off with a bit of concealer all over my
eyelid just to make sure no veins are
visible and also so the eyeshadows
really stand out
next I'm going to fill in my brows with
the fluidline brow cream from Mac I
absolutely love this stuff so I'm just
going to create a bit of an arch and
just fill in any sparse areas and make
them look even more like caterpillars
then I'm going to go in with some
concealer and clean it up so we have a
really sharp line the next step is to go
in with some powder to set the eyelids
to make sure the base isn't sticky then
for eyeshadow I'm going in with my
favorite eyeshadow palette ever it is
the morphe 3 5 0 palette I'm just going
to pick up an orange shade and this is
going to be the transition so I'm just
taking this from inner corner to outer
corner then we're going to take a really
vibrant orange on a smaller blending
brush and this one's going to be more
focused in the crease so a lot of
blending is involved in this look I just
feel like orange is like a really fun
like crazy color but I still feel like
it's wearable I love orange eyeshadow so
now going in with this deeper burgundy
shade this is going to be put right in
the crease of the eye to add some
definition just on a smaller pencil
fluffy brush it is the perfect shade to
go with orange and then I'm going to go
in with some at glitter glue and put
this down as a base for the glitter to
stick on so just all over my lid then
i'm taking this crazy neon orange and
popping it down so pretty
moving onto the face I'm taking the
Bobbi Brown vitamin-enriched face face
and please excuse that big red thing on
my face I scratch my face with a towel
and it just looks like a mess but
anyways this is going to ensure that my
face is really moisturized next step is
the Nivea man aftershave balm this makes
your makeup stay on all day long so this
is a must for a festival now full
foundation we have to match the neck and
the face together so I'm using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
it is the previous color match to my
dark fake tan it has the most beautiful
finish and full coverage I love it so
much so I'm just going to blend this in
with my Beauty Blender that my dog ate
right after I film this video not happy
Jan time for concealer I'm taking the
Too Faced Born This Way I love this
concealer so much so I'm putting this
under my eyes too can't slap those
purple tones and also to give a bit of a
highlight
since it's a festival and you know your
makeup can be as dramatic as you want at
a festival I went in with a highlighting
pin to highlight even more this is the
L'Oreal Lumi magique first time using it
and I really really like it so so far so
good
to set all of that hard work down in
place I'm taking the s-bahn powder I
really want you guys to let me know what
you think of this powder because some
reason it just doesn't sit well on my
foundation I kind of like it but then it
just like kinda doesn't sit right so I
have mixed emotions about it anyways
moving on to set the rest of my face I'm
taking this Mac select shared powder and
just pressing that into my skin for a
bit of a highlight under the eyes I'm
taking the Mac emphasized because I
really wanted that to be like bapin pat
pat pat pat
now for the really fun part so I'm
taking this astralis cream eyeshadow and
I was attempting to do dots that product
didn't work so I went in with the Too
Faced white eyeliner and this worked
perfectly so just drawing two dots right
underneath my eyebrow on each side and I
love the way this turned out so now it's
time to finish off the lower lash line
I'm going in with that really intense
orange shade hoping that from inner
corner to outer corner then going in
with the burgundy shade and just putting
that really close to the lash line to
really define those lashes let's make
these lashes are really long and spider
it just how I like it so I'm taking my
favorite mascara by L'Oreal it is the
L'Oreal telescopic extra black mascara
coating my top and bottom lashes so we
can get ready for some bold seas so
these are the lashes that I'm wearing
today they're really cute and fluffy
they're really easy to apply as well
because they have a really flexible band
so now for contouring I'm taking this a
bobbi brown contouring powder I love
this so much I've used it a lot and for
some reason I still haven't hit pan like
hallelujah so just putting this under my
cheekbones and then I'm going to contour
my nose a little bit which y'all really
tell the difference because I didn't
really do it too much at all
now time to bronze up the face I'm
taking this Too Faced baked bronzer it
is so stunning because it has like
little shimmers throughout it so it
gives like a really nice luminous glow
to the face as well as making it look
like you've been outside some baking all
day so just putting this under my
cheekbones and also around the perimeter
of my face as well so because I wanted
like a really orangey bronzy look I also
went in with the MAC gold deposit and
just put this right on top and then for
blush I'm taking the balm Cindy
Luminizer this one is sort of stunning
because it's nice and glowy and it just
adds a hint of pink to the cheeks for
the highlighter oh my god I'm taking the
moonchild glow kit and I'm picking up
the pink highlighter and I'm honestly
just putting this all over my cheekbones
also up my temple just making this
extremely dramatic
it's a festival and you can do that I'm
also putting this on my nerves as well
to highlight there and then for the lips
I'm taking the Jeffrey style liquid
lipstick this is absolutely amazing the
color the formula I'm obsessed with his
liquid lipsticks oh my god the perfect
nude now going in with a lighter shade
I'm just going to put there Spratt in
the middle of my lips to create a bit of
an ombre effect and then we are done so
I really hope you guys enjoyed this look
if you did please give it a big thumbs
up and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel I love how this makeup look
turned out it's still a bit different
but it's still definitely wearable I do
want to do like a really crazy glittery
intense first of a look so keep an eye
out for that I love you guys so much
and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
