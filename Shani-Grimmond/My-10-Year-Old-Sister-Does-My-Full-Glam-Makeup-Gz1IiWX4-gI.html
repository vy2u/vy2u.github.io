like always outside and like playing
with toys and stuff do you still go
outside and ride scooters and bikes cuz

agree that left me and ye when I was
like young girl and obviously you were
younger to do you think that we weren't
as close yeah why do you think we
started getting close yeah I know I
think um like it's really important to
obviously stay really close with your
family and like when I was like in high
school in primary school I wasn't as
close with my little brother and she's
dying like my older brother and then
like obviously like when I left high
school that's when I realized how
important it is to have a like a really
close relationship with him so keep that
in mind guys
I was always focusing on like my friends
and like school and stuff but really
what's most important is your family Wow
cool we've always liked being close but
not not like this close
I feel like we're besties am I still
your best friend yeah you sure yeah are

bought you a toothbrush
sorry little update sorry do I have to
like not talk okay a little update in my
last video I told you guys I was going
to look at new houses because I'm moving
out because the construction so bad and
I found two other houses but I'm still
hoping that the one that I applied for
the other day I hope I get it cuz has a
pool and everything it's so amazing but
these other two houses don't have a pool
you like them didn't you yeah they would
build nice this house is going
everywhere oh yeah that's why I always
do my eyeshadow first um I'm gonna use
the eyeliner okay you're doing the whole
wax showing the product I love that

that's so fun I've done this I've
literally like I can't even do a winged
liner sorry thing you can do when I'd
actually be concerned I don't know you

these videos wouldn't like the ink gets
into the eye so I'm not going to do that
