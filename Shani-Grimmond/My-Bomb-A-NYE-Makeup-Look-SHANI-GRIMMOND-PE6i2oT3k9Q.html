music before I film to get in the mood
as I said in yesterday's video but hello
guys welcome to my channel so in today's
video we are doing it day three of a
week with SHINee today I really want to
do just a really amazing incredible New
Year's Eve makeup look so New Year's Eve
is literally in what two days so well
pretty much tomorrow when I upload this
video I'm gonna show you guys what I'm
gonna be doing for New Year's I just
want to do a really nice makeup look
using all of my favourite products just
products that I know that I'm gonna look
amazing and they're gonna last all night
on my face so my favorite look is a warm
turn on the eyes really bronzy on the
cheeks really highlighted and then an
amazing nude glossy lip sorry that's
what's gonna happen today I hope you
guys are enjoying a wig with SHINee
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
so you don't miss any more videos and
let's go ahead and get right into it oh
my god it is so hot in this room the
first thing that I'm doing is starting
with the eyes so that means we're going
to shape the face by doing the eyebrows
or I'm taking my favorite eyebrow
product at the moment this is the
benefit of browsing pellet in the shade
number three so we have a wax side and
then a powder side so first I'm going to
take the waxy side and just shape the
brow so make the arch nice and high
I guess everyone has different eyebrow
shapes there so it's hard to tell you
guys what to do but just take your
favorite eyebrow product and fill your
brows in how you like I obviously want
mine to be very dramatic for New Year's
I just find the waxy formula very easy
true reshape the eyebrows and then I
like to go in with the powder off dog
because I feel like it kind of sets that
down in place I noticed a lot of people
have been commenting on my videos saying
they don't like when I do my brows be
collect this but like I don't care three
get Fox that I should are just literally
fell out and went all over me it was
that and it wasn't silver so I don't
like this carpet is fully cocked like
there's so many stains of makeup on it
like I have to replace it someone
so the first the first color I'm gonna
take is this medium brown shade right
here and that's gonna be a transition
color so I'm just gonna load it up on my
brush and we're gonna pop this in my
crease oh my god I love the Marc Jacobs
eyeshadow so much just look really well
they blend in nicely they don't fade
away into nothing beautiful and I'm just
taking that on a morphe and five one
eight brush I'm going to blend it up
nice and high I'm actually so excited
for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day
it's gonna be so much fun it's gonna be
partying and I haven't done that in so
long I mean it's been like two weeks
let's be real like usually I'd go out
every weekend the next color I'm taking
is this a beautiful burgundy color right
here and I'm gonna blend that into my
crease with a bdellium tools 776 brush
this brush feels like the heads about to
fall off not too sure what's going on
there but let's start by taking this and
a little windshield wiper motions oh my
god this is gonna match my skirts so
well it's gonna be amazing I'm just
trying to figure out if I should work i
contacts i mean i probably weren't
because they're like kind of
uncomfortable what it'll look so cool if
I have like all wise love just changing
up my look you know I'm gonna try my
best to keep this as circular as I can
around my crease just because I want to
create the illusion of like a bigger
eyelid instead of winging it out but I
mean like let's be real I'm probably
gonna wing it out soon anyway I was
really happy as well this morning I work
hop and I'm like oh my god ill festival
nerd dead skin you know I wake up and
I'm like oh my god my pimples are kind
of like going down perfect timing and
then I look in the mirror there's a new
one that popped up or even a night
that's had an ass I just I can't do it
anymore
next up I'm going in oh my god I'm like
actually drop my finger off I'm gonna go
in with this dark brown right here and
I'm just gonna pop that on the outer
half of my eye to really deepen that
area up but I want most of it to be that
cranberry shade anyway so just a touch
next thing I'm doing is taking my mac
fix+ I'm just gonna spray my brush so it
is nice and wet and then I'm gonna take
this beautiful color right here and I'm
gonna pack that on the in a half of my
eyelid this is gonna be stunning I could
just feel it you know Oh see beautiful
oh oh so I've kind of just bilenda these
two colors together by just like padding
over really lightly when there's not
much product left on the brush and then
I'm going in with a makeup white i'm
gonna clean up any fallout a little bit
and then i take my finger and kind of
just run along that line where I clean
up the eyeshadow so it kind of like
fades it out a little bit now it's time
to the mascara this one is the a Bobbie
Brown smoky eye mascara I love this one
so much I'm just gonna cart my top
lashes so we can prep them for falsies I
guess it doesn't really matter what
mascara you use it's as long as you make
them nice and where I stopped my Y oh my
god
I literally just what sucks my umbrella
light my shirt all right so we're gonna
do a little bit of winged liner okay so
I'm gonna take the Kat Von D tattoo
liner this one's at my fave I had a long
I can't leave it's not empty
now time for the lashes so I'm gonna
take these ones by lash warrior these
ones are literally humongous like this
is what you call New Year's Eve lashes
they're so big I'm just gonna go ahead
and trim them because they are really
long and hopefully they're not too home
oh no such thing these lashes I'm gonna
be massive I'm so excited so I'm just
gonna stick these as close as I can to
the lash line oh then I'm gonna pinch
them down see as you can see already it
just makes it look so much more dramatic
big old lashes always fix everything
I literally just spent like 20 minutes
blending out my eye shadow because I
really wanted to be perfect because in
yesterday's video it was really patchy
and some of the dark shades would fade
on the outer corner and then it would go
darker it was just it was not cute at
all so I've made sure that it is just
how I want it so now I can move on to
the face so I'm gonna take the huda
beauty complexion perfection pre makeup
base I've actually never used it before
I've had it for a while and I'm super
excited to see how it goes because I
adore who you hide or who your beauty's
makeup products very much like
everything we're just gonna blend this
in all over my face oh my god it's very
thick and it's smells totally good
actually it's really sticky so I feel
like it's really gonna make the
foundation stick like glue now we can
move on to the foundation so I'm gonna
take my G way high coverage cream find
it wow that is sorry yellow like what's
the actual dogs coming on I'm taking
this off I'm just gonna prime again and
then I'm going to use a foundation that
I know is gonna be like the perfect
shade I did not expect it to be that
yellow it is the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I just picked up a new
one of this and this one's in the shade
at 6.5 I haven't used it since so long
but this has always been you know or one
of my all-time favorite foundations it
just feels super light on the skin it
has great coverage it's very watery sir
I'm just gonna use the other side of the
Beauty Blender
bounces all over oh my god it's
definitely on it's high coverage is the
other one huh good couple all of that
redness goodbye I'm not gonna lie I
totally bought this foundation for my
friend for his Christmas present and
Here I am using it so sorry Joe but no
Christmas present for you let's go in
with my favorite concealer of all times
you guys know what it is I'm sure every
single person you watch on YouTube uses
this as their concealer it is the Tarte
shaped tape in the shade light/medium I
mean for New Year's we have no time to
experiment so this is the best concealer
I have it's the best concealer in the
world let's be real so I'm just gonna
put this under my eyes to get rid of any
darkness and to highlight at the same
time so I'm just gonna look up and blend
it out with my Beauty Blender and the
great thing about using a Beauty Blender
is it picks up any excess concealer as
well it doesn't look cakey it just picks
up anything extra that you don't need
you blend it up seamlessly I'm also
gonna conceal over my tear duct here as
well because I'm gonna put a nice
shimmery shade there obviously it's New
Year's Eve we need a little bit of
sparkle next thing I'm taking is my
favorite translucent powder at the
moment it is the look Prarie cellular
treatment a loose powder now the reason
why I love this is because it literally
melts into the skin you can put it on
and you don't really have to like blend
it away because it's just like it just
like Mel C and it's beautiful so I'm
just gonna put a really small amount
under there and let my skin eat it up
I'm also gonna bake my laugh lines as
well the great thing about this product
is that it doesn't like make the face
stiff at all it just sets it and then it
just like leaves the building it's great
I hope you miners as well I never
thought like a $200 pad it would be
worth it but I actually think it is okay
so let's move on to the powder I'm gonna
set my whole face with the Mac Studio
Fix powder in the shade NC 42 I usually
use my benefit hello flawless powder all
the time but like I ran out I've used
two in my life and I've ran out and I'm
really sad so I'm just going to use this
I mean it's not bad it's definitely
making my face a little bit more Orange
oh wait that would mean something in my
brush this one's actually a foundation
powder I'm pretty sure I don't know so
it's gonna add a little bit of extra
coverage why not don't forget to do the
is good then I'm going back in with this
Marc Jacobs pellet right here I love it
so much I'm gonna take that Burgundy
I mean nariño bag and it's like a
purpley Brown and I'm gonna put that on
my lower lash line but I'm gonna keep it
really close to the actual lash line I'm
actually so obsessed with this makeup
look it's not like the typical bag and
do you look because it has like purple
transit area like this branding purple
shade then I'm gonna take the burgundy
shade and blend just underneath that so
we have a nice gradient under the eyes I
mean these colors work really well
together then I'm going in with a white
eyeliner to really open up my eyes this
one is mr. right by Ilana oh God
from the bombed they're just like hurt
my makeup look I've had enough okay I'm
just gonna look how warm it up on the
back of my hand and go into town and
then of course going in with the Bobby
Brown mascara again I'm just gonna cart
my bottom eyelashes so they're nice and
long I feel like this miss cars mm-hmm
that was close
then to set the eyebrows down I'm taking
the benefit 3d brow turns in the shade -
well is that a shade wouldn't say sir
but this is a light brown I'm just gonna
push my brows upwards give him a little
bit of texture coming out my or Benny
has sticky tape on her foot
I thought she was into something come
here bin what is this bin alright let's
move on to the bronzer I'm taking the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer I'm
gonna use this as a contouring shade so
I'm just gonna put this in the hollows
of my cheek bone oh my god I'm Sun to
get that foundation line I think and I'm
also gonna take this a
my forehead as well just to deepen it up
a tiny bit of course my jewel line it
actually tastes like chocolate because
like I mean hailing all the little
particles and now we can go in with the
really bronzy shade so this is from
Ifrah it is a blush / bronzer apparently
this one's in the shade bronze in gold I
love this so so much I'm just gonna take
an angular brush this one's from Mac and
I'm gonna get rid of the excess and just
go into town I feel like these angled
brushes are a lot better to use and like
a big fluffy brush because when I use a
big fluffy brush it comes down too far
like under here like someone's having a
party outside like why does that keep
happening like go back to work okay
holidays are great like where all the
shimmer is it makes it look a little bit
dirty because it's a gold flecks I don't
know I'm just gonna go with a little bit
of the terra cotta bronzer by girl on
looks like this a little bit more orange
hmm yeah I don't think I'm gonna use
that one too much I'm just gonna bake
with my lip rarey powder to clean up
that line then I'm just gonna blend it
all away and we should have a cleaner
line nothing too dramatic though now we
can move on to the blush sorry this is
one of my favorites it is the nos blush
in the shade at lustre it's like a
Coralie pinky shade and it is very
shimmery so it looks beautiful in the
cheeks I'm just gonna blend this in with
that same bronzer brush that I use
because they want to cheeks to be super
grungy but just with a pop of pink now
for the moment that everyone's been
waiting for
highlight well at least I've been
waiting for this moment it is the era
highlight in the shade Rodeo Drive so
I'm just going to absolutely douse this
all over my cheekbones like obviously
for New Year's I want to be glowing like
crazy this is the Anastacio a 23 brush
it's the best highlighting brush I've
said that a million times
oh my god yeah that's true laughing
that keeps applying it I was first to
use the one in the shade blissful this
one's more of like a peachy shade suits
my skin turned it off could you imagine
if I just left it like that I strikes is
here Wow send help then for the lips
like going in with my favorite a lip
liner at the moment it is from a g-way
it is the long wear creme lip liner and
it's in the shade I feel like I should
always look at the shade first it's in
the shade Sienna this is a really nice
nude color and then for the lip color
I'm gonna take these lipsticks by buxom
we have true shades here the first one
is nude and the second one is buff so
I'm gonna put the buff shade in the
middle to make more like an ombre but
the reason why I don't want to do like a
liquid lipstick is because it makes that
a really gross line like right there
sorry
I don't want that to happen I want to
kind of fade a little bit better so
that's why I'm using this one oh my god
it's so light I didn't realize they say
this all the time I'm gonna go back in
with that lip liner and outline my lips
once again just so we have a little bit
more definition on the lips because it
is so light
the last thing I'm doing is taking the
Urban Decay all nighter making makeup
setting spray this one's in long lasting
this is gonna be perfect for New Year's
Eve makeup a sound all night oh oh my
god guys I was sorry close to forgetting
an inner corner highlight so I'm gonna
go in with this Tarte chrome paint
shadow put in a shade at papillote so
it's a really nice champagne e
sparkly shades I'm just gonna take a
pencil brush and pack it on my inner
corner I actually want to spray it with
fixed glass as well I feel like this is
what's gonna add a lot of like drama a
lot of New Year's Eve vibes to it
I swear to god I just fed Michael yella
oil on hell I just put in my
little hoops so now I'm gonna go in with
that highlighter that I used before and
I'm just gonna highlight my collarbones
gonna make you never say that probably
this is gonna make everything look even
better a bit of sparkle up here don't
forget to do the actual shoulder you can
just do that if you really want this is
what the final result looks like I'm so
happy with how it looks I love the lip
color I know a lot of people might think
it's a little bit too light but I don't
really wear a lot lip that often sorry I
know I feel like it's a little bit
different and I just love the way it
looks and I love cranberry on the eyes
I'm so happy with how they look
especially with this look cute little
