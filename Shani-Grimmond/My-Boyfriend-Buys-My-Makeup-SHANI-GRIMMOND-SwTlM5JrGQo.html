making come what's ready remain thought
when I'm getting ready for clubbing
saying hey I when she gets a new stuff
she gives new home lucky she had MLM ran
100 guys around the edges of this gig
looks good for song
well I'm going to my makeup now let's go
ahead and jump right in
the first thing I'm doing is my eyebrows
and this literally took like two hours
to find an eyebrow product I'm not even
kidding was so hard because well I don't
know why you just couldn't find so this
one is the Bobbi Brown long-wear brow
gel and I have the shade taupe he thinks
it's going to be too late for me but it
was promotional closest to my eyebrow
shade well in his opinions I've never
ever heard anyone talk about this I'm so
excited
whoa the consistency is not true runny
so that's a good thing
let's go ahead and fill them in wow it's
big I like it
did I like the consistency that means
it's not going to be easy to make a
mistake and the colors really nice as
well thanks John my darlin the formula
of this product is a really waxy and
it's making my brows look
really natural like it definitely look
like I've sealed them in looks like
they're naturally a perfect
I mean I rather never precise we've
drinking next up is concealer to cover
all these veins and to carve out my
eyebrows or this one is the double we're
stay in place flawless wear concealer by
Estee Lauder and he chose the shade
light/medium warm which I would have
gone for a lighter shade but it does
look like it's going to match like
pretty well just no highlight going on
on my face so I've know how this product
I mean I know if they're double wear
foundation but I didn't know it was
concealer so this is exciting I woke up
with this weird like under my arms sugar
views let's go ahead and paint this one
more eyelid oh girl or the SA Lauder
Double Wear products Bank it's going to
blend this out oh the colors actually
amazing I love it it's nice and warm
turn thank God I didn't get like a pink
one okay so now for the eyeshadow this
is the Stila I should have tell it in a
matte end metal so if Jonathan can pick
up that I like the warm tones and Rose
tones I'm pretty sure anyone can so this
color selection is so beautiful I've
never used steel eyeshadows before this
is going to be so fun
okay so I'm going to start by taking at
this light pink color right here and
this is going directly in the crease
with my Mac two to four brush so let's
see how they work
this is a really light shade so I want
this to like peek through right
underneath my eyebrow then I'm taking at
this darker rosy pink color right here
and this is going oh she knows this is
going directly under that light pink
color like in my crease I'm taking a
smaller blending brush for this step so
I'm just messing putting this in my
crease from outer corner all the way to
inner corner and then we'll take that
original blending brush with the light
pink and use that shade to blend out the
edges up here so it's nice and seamless
you guys know the drill
next I'm taking this really pretty pinky
champagne color right here I was going
to pass this all over my lid a relief
to pigment finish shimmery pull up now
it's time for the fun part foundation so
this one is the Laura Mercier snot cream
moisturizing a photo edition foundation
and he chose a shade at bamboo ish
I honestly forget what this color looks
like I'm a little bit nervous people is
going to match my foundation better than
I can
wow that is a really nice palette really
warm / neutral it's not too yellow I'm
just going to apply this with my Beauty
Blender it is very thick has amazing
coverage holy crap and is why my lip
balm off I always like to go over my
lips for some reason probably better up
applying this foundation with a kabuki
brush because it is so sick it is a
little bit light but you know what I
always get connection there too dark for
me so this is kind of relieving oh it's
covering literally everything oh my god
you can tell how full coverage a
foundation is when you go over the lips
now it's time for the concealer so going
in with the team at double wear
concealer oh that's what this is going
to be like darker than my foundation but
not bad
now simple ended out with my Beauty
Blender again I actually love the Buddha
bandha
when I go to Magic Johnson tries out all
my brushes hmm like that it's covering
everything onto my eyes so that's a good
thing
oh my god I just realized he didn't buy
translucent powder so we have to work
with what we have okay so this is the
mask Jacob's Mirage filter 40 this has a
highlighting powder and a contour in it
so that is not very nice to me I don't
like setting under my eyes with yellow
and that is way too cool turns my liking
but let's just find a brush and work
with it just get my brush in here I'm
going to cut it down under here I mean
not bad under my eyes it's definitely
set
boom and mustard skin evidence 180
kidding me and pretty sure that was like
a hundred dollars okay so Jonathan
actually bought two powders we have the
benefit hello flawless which I actually
already have when you go to a different
shade you got champagne this is what the
color looks like looks pretty good
actually and then the other one that you
got is the Stila illuminating powder
foundation it's a fucking refill oh
sorry this is what we're working with
I think I'm gonna use the hello flawless
actually no I use all the time don't I
okay I'll use this kill 100 so this is a
powder foundation so it's got coverage
right um shit just going to have to make
sure I evenly blend this around my face
so it's not patchy never really liked
powder foundations because like how do
you get them perfectly even on top of
foundation and like I don't want to wear
them on their own because my face is dry
let's move on to underneath the eyes I'm
going to go in with that Jack pinky
purple color here on my lower lash line
chromatic line in a corner I'm just
going to use a little pencil brush this
is a zoeva luxe pencil in 2:30 I'm just
going to drag that under here to
proportionality eyeshadow and then for
the mascara this one is a Smashbox hyper
lash mascara never used one from
Smashbox so this is going begin the one
actually looks really nice so we're
looking at a different one and the one
was really fat using unity and I sent
Lancer good job hmm not bad it's really
separating every single lash just good
making it look like I actually have lots
I wouldn't say it's adding a lot of
volumes or we actually forgot to get
false lashes so I'm definitely not
fusing that's it I'm just going to take
these ones from the lash warriors and
these ones are in the style
sa-18 key okay my lashes are on and I
feel so much better
both lashes so let's go back in with the
Marc Jacobs palette I'm going to pick up
the brown shade yeah this is so cool
torn I'm so nervous
we're going to lightly put that in my
jaw
no cheekbone I always get those two
fucking move stop I'm staying
just taking a very light hand I like
that color just looks like a natural
shadow okay so now let's move on to the
bronzer I have this one from Smashbox in
the shade warm matte soda plunge more of
a warm toned it's still very matte so
let's see how this goes not freshly you
might just use like a tapered bronzer
brush or very powdery which means gonna
be pigmented so shake it off oh I'm not
I like when they're not overly pigmented
or otherwise um because I'm like way too
heavy oh I really like the color of this
line it's nice and orange I actually
mean that I love orange bronzer I'm also
going to take this around my hairline to
my face a little bit I really like how
that looks
love the color the formula everything
I'm so impressed with this but I do want
more of like a glowy cheek so I'm going
to go away with this Smashbox fusion
soft light base star burr dressin
thought this is a blush so yeah I'm
gonna use a bronzer because there's only
two little pink triangles in there so I
think it'll work better as a bronzer I'm
just going to lightly dab into the
bronzer shade and brush this over I'm
just going to put this on the apples of
my cheeks as well while I'm here
that's really nice it's definitely not
dramatic is nothing natural but I worked
nicely um he got another blush because
it came with a highlight and he couldn't
find a highlight on its own so this is
the Smashbox LA light blush and
highlight palette is what it looks like
there was another one that was really
nice but he wanted this one so cool
firstly I'm going to go in with this
color right here and this is going to go
right on the apples of my cheeks oh god
that's so pigmented all God in like this
color and also dress for my eye look
right now it's actor black pink
it's time to highlight and spring my
brush with at six months because I want
my highlight to be so intense so I'm
going to go in with a taste growth going
on with this color right here which is a
pinky highlight our house is vinegar I
really notice
well what's like so pink is good I taste
is so red I don't like that with this I
look like it's really pretty but like if
I had pink on the eyes you know okay so
to make that mole of like a gold
highlight I'm going to take this I show
from the scaler palette and hopefully
it's light enough for my skin tone to
highlight with looks good so you don't
always need actual highlight to
highlight your face you can just use
eyeshadow whoa that's intense
I love it I'm going to go ahead and put
that same a gold color on my inner
corner for a little bit of light in
there
oh my god is gold closed so intense but
I'm talking about
and then lastly he got a Stila stay all
day liquid lipstick in the shade
dominatrix no dude I have caramel err so
it took like tiny little specks of
sparkle in there and I hate when liquid
lipsticks have sparkle in it totally you
can't see on the lips it does look like
a really nice fruity brown color berry
so good job John a lot of so sparkly
some pretty pigmented what the hell the
shade caramel oh that I have is a lot
more pigmented but it sounds like a tiny
bit more sheer but it feels really nice
on the lips so you can definitely see a
few little shimmers in the lip but I
think the color is actually really nice
it's something that I would never
usually lean towards it's definitely
unique but I don't think it goes really
well with my eyeshadow look hmm but
that's okay that's not my fault that's
Jonathan's hope so I really hope you
