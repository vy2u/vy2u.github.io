my channel so today I'm talking about my
eyebrow tattooing treatment I'm so tired
to talk about it because I am I'm just
so obsessed with how they look now and
before I got my eyebrows tattooed on I
was so incredibly unhappy with my
eyebrows I hated feeling my eyebrows in
I have the shape of them they were
fluffy and bushy and completely uneven
so that's the reason why I did get my
rest headed on and also because I
thought it would save a little time when
I'm doing my makeup because they're
already kind of left the whole shape is
there for me and all I have to do is
kind of go over it quickly so right now
I have makeup over the top of them but I
will insert clips of me with that makeup
to kind of show that you that it does
still look natural and real when you
don't have makeup on at all so it
doesn't look like you actually have your
eyebrows hand on it just looks like
you've got perfect brows so I got my
eyebrows done in Brisbane at a place
called I boutique they do a few other
things like eyelash extensions and
tinting and all that stuff but Chloe
recommended me to get my eyebrows
tattooed there because that's where she
but first done and I'm so glad that she
got those done before so then I could
kind of see in real life that they were
gonna look really good and still natural
I did a lot of research on their page I
love stalking and I loved every single
look that they did sells like okay this
is the one I booked in and I went and
got it done so now I'm going to talk
about the whole process so basically
what happened was I went for my consult
and the lady that did my brows can agree
by the way she outlined my brows with
like her I don't know what it was like a
measuring thing for eyebrows and she
made them really play symmetrical and
just made them look really good and did
the outline of the brows to make sure I
was going to be happy with the actual
aftermath of it so before you do get
your brows on you actually see what they
don't like anywhere and you can tweak
things that you don't like I can change
things and all of that and then a few
days later I went in for my actual
appointment I was so excited because my
brows on my head click some serious kind
of slugs or something I've always been
quite happy with my brows the first
thing that happened was I got numbing
cream put all over my eyebrows so I
couldn't feel anything so that was left
on for about 20 minutes so she's reading
my magazine
you waiting for that to kick in and then
I went on in and the treatment usually
lasts around two so I was including the
numbing treatment time and I just laid
on the bed got the brows like all mapped
up again was okay with it so we started
the treatment I was honestly expecting
it to hurt so much more than what it did
I'm a scale one to ten I'd probably say
it was a band 0.5 I just I didn't heard
it all like it was just you could feel
it but you couldn't feel pain if you
know what I mean like it feels someone
touching your brows but it didn't hurt
and that so reads me because at the end
of the day are your eyebrows are getting
cut up an inch getting put in it must
have been good numbing cream bindi you
need to calm down job trying to film a
video and so then I looked in the mirror
and I was like holy they look so
different I was trying to get used to
the whole like different shape of my
brows because I feel like they will lift
it up a little bit higher because all of
the fluff underneath had to get getting
gone because I was horrible and then we
also made an arch as well because my
eyebrows are super straight with what I
don't you still obviously be straight
because that's just a shape around I
don't think you can really change that
so yeah we've got a little bit of an
arch and just so they weren't completely
slugs it honestly saves me so much time
when I'm doing a makeup
I literally just quickly run over them
if I have a dramatic makeup look on if I
I'm just having like a foundation
mascara bronzer kind of day I didn't
even fill in my brows because they're
already tinted and stuff oh this is just
I just wish that I did this earlier so
when I left I noticed my brows were a
little bit sensitive like lifting them
up like this it kind of hurt a bit so I
just tried to keep my brows down
important so I tried not to make too
many facial expressions and if you guys
watch my videos you would know that
would be a hard task and it's always
like oh the rules are we do get your
brows tattooed on you cannot wet them
for five days after which I found kind
of hard but obviously worth it so when I
wash my face if you only wash the bottom
part and then I using makeup wet up here
and then when I was in the showers just
like my border you don't wet my face so
I had a cream to put over my brows every
day for a week to make sure they didn't
dry up to keep them nice and moist and
so
it doesn't scare anything I actually
I've had a lot of people getting scabby
eyebrows after they got an eyebrow how
do it but I didn't get that thank God
so about two weeks later I went for my
touch-up and I think everyone has to get
a touch time it just depends whether or
not you have any ink fall out so I feel
like the top of my arch was where most
of the fallout was our wives a little
bit of skin just didn't want the ink
inside of it but yeah I went went back
and probably only took about 45 minutes
this time because obviously we weren't
doing the whole thing over again so
numbing cream went on fix up the arches
and all that good stuff and my brows
look good as new so this is actually
crazy the second day after I left the
house after getting my brows had read on
I went shopping there's like three three
tools three people complimented my
eyebrows I've never ever got compliments
about my eye rather than mine Tyler and
I was like yes do it
thank you always Oh excited I think I've
covered everything have I bhindi she's
been sitting on my lap this whole time I
just love it I bought makeup with liquid
makeup off key so the main thing that I
want to stress is you got to make sure
you're going to a good artist because
you don't want black slugs drawn on your
face just like a sharpie I have seen
some horrible treatments in the past of
randoms on Google I don't know who they
went to well they've obviously pays
someone that didn't know what they were
doing and you wanna make sure that
you're going to a good place so I would
definitely recommend a boutique I had no
drama them at all I love the shake and
if you go on the Instagram can see all
the eyebrows of the transform and I'm in
trance formed crazy baby's gotta jump
off by Big D dude help me go so I think
that's pretty much all I have to say for
this video um I don't want you guys
thinking lip injections tattooed
eyebrows usually say I got my eyebrows
tattooed on because they were completely
uneven they were just they had no shape
to them they look like two different
eyebrows like obviously they look like
they weren't related is what I'm trying
to say you know how that supposed to be
like on a dress with like sisters will
they look like not even friends like
enemies thanks so much for watching guys
I will see you in my next video hi I'm
by the way this is what they will play
when I draw over them to make them more
dramatic when I have a super dramatic
makeup look still the same shape but
just a bit darker a bit longer at the
tail yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
