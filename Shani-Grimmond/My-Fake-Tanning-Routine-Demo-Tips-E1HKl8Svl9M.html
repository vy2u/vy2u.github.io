my channel so in today's video I am
doing my fake tanning routine I'm so
excited right now I am addicted to fake
tan you guys have no idea and I've been
training for about four years now like
every single week I will not miss a week
I hate being pale I just think I look
better with a bit of a Broadus to the
skin I hate tanning in the Sun I get
moles freckles I'm so afraid of skin
cancer it's obviously just a lot safer
to fake tan and that's just what I like
to do so okay I'm sorry
when I even think about peghead I just
get so happy it literally makes my life
so the tan that I use is the Bondi
stands self-tanning foam in the shade
ultra dark they finally came out with
the ultra dark shade and let me just
tell you I am completely obsessed with
it I've never been so obsessed with a
tan in my life unfortunately this little
baby is only available in Australia at
the moment but it will be available in
the US and UK early next year which
isn't too low at all so keep your eyes
peeled if you are from there if you are
from there and you can't get this I will
still have a lot of tips and tricks for
fake tan in this video so make sure you
keep watching before I give you guys a
step-by-step guide of how I apply my tan
I just want to let you know that I do
have a 20% off discount code for Blondo
sand and that is just shiny sha and I if
you wanna save some dosh there you go
okay so let's get into the step-by-step
guide the first thing that I do is I go
in with an exfoliating admit this step
is so incredibly important if you don't
exfoliate the dead skin off your body
you're going to have a really patchy tan
it's just going to stick to any dry dead
skin and it's just going to be like dark
light dark light and trust me I had to
learn the hard way with that one so what
I do is have a really hot shower as hot
as I can take I let the water fall into
my body and I just soak there for like
two minutes so all of my pores open
starts to get really steamy so that way
it's easier to take old turn off or even
easier to just select get rid of dead
skin cells so I usually scrub the dead
skin off for about five minutes to make
sure I don't miss any spots at all and
then of course it is your time to go
ahead and
I like to shave my legs my pits and then
I refreshes a dolphin I feel like a
dolphin I can do anything I personally
like to exfoliate the day before I fake
tan because if you have a hot shower and
then you fake tan straight away all of
your pores are going to be open so the
10 is actually going to go inside of
your pores and leave black holes so if
you do have time to do it the day before
that is perfect if you don't have time
to exfoliate the day before you need to
do it all in one day and get it done
that's completely fine as well
but you just want to make sure you
finish off your hot shower after you've
exfoliated and shaved make sure you turn
the hot off and turn the freezing-cold
on so all of your pores can close and
then you want to make sure you wait at
least an hour before you do fake tan as
I said otherwise the 10 is just not
going to stick as well because your skin
is still a little bit wet in the pores
and the pores will still be open a bit
so just give it one hour before you fake
tan and you'll be sweet now it's time
for the fun part applying the tan before
you do any application of any tan you
want to make sure you go in with a
really light not a greasy moisturizer
you don't want any oil in the
moisturizer and just take a tiny bit
just put it on your wrist put it on your
feet any dry areas that you may have so
your knees you don't want to apply it
all over your body otherwise the tans
not going to be as intense so basically
where you put the moisturizer is where
the 10 is going to be less intense and
less less patchy so always want to do
your whole hand otherwise it's really
going to stick in these wrinkles right
here you don't want that do you then
I'll take my tanning foam on my tanning
mitt bondo stands just recently came out
with a new mitt and let me tell you it
is the best meat I've ever used because
it's really fluffy so it doesn't leave
any streaks at all so what I do is I put
it on and I do put a glove on under the
mitt because you don't want any tan
going on your hands that you don't want
because this tent is so dark and is
going to stain your hands if it does get
on there so I'd recommend just buying
some plastic gloves to wear under your
mitt and you are super safe so what I do
is I take about three pumps for each
section of my body I really I I go crazy
with my tan I literally sometimes with
ten pumps on one part of my body and I'm
just like yes give it to me so then you
want to rub it in circular motions until
there's no streaks there's obviously no
particular way to do it you just want
make sure that you do have an even
application you want to make sure you
leave your elbows your knees your hands
and your feet to last because you want
the smallest amount of product left on
your mitt and then you can just quickly
go over those areas after you've applied
as many coats as you want I personally
do well it's not even countable because
I applied that many layers of fake ten
but just until you have the color that
you want then it is time to wait so I
personally like to let my tan dry for at
least five to ten minutes before I put
any clothing on and then when you do put
clothing on you want to make sure it's
loose-fitting I'm going to make sure
it's black because it could transfer
onto the like white clothes or gray
clothes and you're going to be able to
notice it it will come out in the wash
but it is just safer to wear black
clothes so then you can't see it at all
it does have a really strong like
coconut scent I personally like it and
the ultra dive ten you have to leave on
for at least six hours for the color to
fully develop so I personally like to
10:00 in the morning around like 10
o'clock and then I leave it on until I'm
ready to go to bed I personally can't
leave any ten on when I'm sleeping even
if it is pretty dry it's still going to
be a little bit tacky obviously you've
got all this product on your skin I
can't sleep if my skin is not completely
dry and clean and I've just got another
shower so I know most people can sleep
in a ten if you can amazing that is like
so lucky for you because I always have
it on during the daytime and I'm like
walking around I bump into walls is like
a big pink mark on the woman like sorry
but I mean the whole process of waiting
at six hours is completely completely
worth it the tan lasts around five to
seven days so I mean what six hours in
one day really something that is a
really really useful tip is baby powder
you can just take some of this Johnson's
baby powder put it on your body or it's
open and then rub it in with like a
really fluffy makeup brush it's going to
take away any stickiness at all I've
only done this once so I don't know if
it does take away any colour at all but
when I did do it my tan was still as
dark as normal and that was the first
time I've ever slept in my tan it pretty
much just absorbs any excess 10 as far
as I'm concerned it doesn't affect the
10 and you
a shape or form but I will keep you guys
updated on like snapchat if you want to
follow me on there then it's Charlie
agreement and I'm just going to keep
testing out that theory because honestly
when you put it on just rub it in your
skin is completely soft it feels
completely dry and it's like you don't
even have a tan on and then you wake up
the next day and you are so bronzed once
you've left your tan on for at least six
hours then you want to go ahead and jump
in the shower now this is where a lot of
people go wrong you want to make sure
you have a cold shower if you can or a
warm to cold shower if you can't do
really freezing cold showers because if
you have a hot shower your pores are
going to open the tan not all but
obviously some of the ten is going to
come out of your pores and you're not
going to be as dark um so yeah cold
shower and you want to make sure you're
in there for only like 15 seconds
honestly when I get in the shower I just
rinse it off until the water is clear
and then I jump straight out just so
none of that color fades at all because
that's still the time where the tan is
just still developing and getting as
strong as it should be so when it comes
to drying yourself you want to make sure
you're really gentle with it with the
towel you want to make sure that you're
putting really gently you don't want to
rub it because you don't want to disturb
any of that color and of course it is
important to use a black towel you use a
white towel your mum and dad will know
about it let me tell you when it comes
to maintaining the tan you want to make
sure that you are moisturizing your skin
every single day otherwise your skin
could get pretty dry because obviously
putting any type of chemicals on your
body is going to dry your skin out so
you just want to go in there with a
really thick nice body butter just
lather it all over your body I
personally as I said before can't do
greasy feelings at all so I have to do
like a really thin moisturizer and the
tan doesn't last as long as it would if
I was using a thick moisturizer so if
you can handle that greasy feel I really
think body butter may be from like the
body shop I know they're super thick
that would be incredible but I just use
the Vaseline and it still does a very
good job when it comes around to about
five to seven days of your ten being on
and it starts to fade and if you want to
boost our you're welcome
this is the one excess wash off instant
tan in dark so this is going to give
your skin
an instant tan literally in five seconds
so what I do is I moisturize my whole
body before I put this on just because
the formula of this 10 is super super
dry and that is because it is an instant
tan and when you spray it on it's dry
straight away so that's why you have to
moisturize otherwise it's going to be
kind of patchy so just spray this on
directly and then rub it in and
literally it is the most beautiful
natural tan looking color it is very
very very very dark which is why I love
it so much if you don't like a really
really dark tan I'd definitely go for
the light but I honestly lack I cannot
tell you how much I love this product
and the ultra dark like I am so happy
that I'm working with Bondi sands
because I've never loved a brand so much
in my life the product themselves and
also the people working behind it I've
gone for many lunches and like launch
parties with them and the people working
behind one of those hands are honestly
so kind-hearted so amazing and just
genuine real people and I love him for
emerged and they've just made the most
amazing tanning products I've ever used
honestly I've used every ten you can
think of and I put it like one product
here one product here another product
here some of my legs and I always always
always go back to Bondi sands like every
time and then of course when it is time
to scrub your tan off you will notice
the tan fading and like this area here
actually I think that's just me because
I get really oily in this area but for
me it's here on the armpits um around my
feet start to get a bit patchy that's
when you repeat this whole process again
scrubbing your tan off isn't that hard
if you leave it around seven days um and
you have like a really hot shower and
just scrub scrub scrub so that we have
my tanning routine I really hope you
guys learned some tips and tricks along
the way I've been doing this for at
least four years now and I feel like
it's just something that is a routine in
my life I do it every Thursday night
Friday night ready for the weekend and
tanning just makes me so much more
confident I just feel I just feel so
happy when I bronze I know that could
sound so silly but that's just how it
makes me feel if you don't like tanning
that it's completely fine I have nothing
against pale skin at all like
is beautiful but I just prefer to have a
bit of a bronze
bit of a dark bronze really if you
enjoyed this video please give it a big
thumbs up because it helps me out so
much I love you and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
