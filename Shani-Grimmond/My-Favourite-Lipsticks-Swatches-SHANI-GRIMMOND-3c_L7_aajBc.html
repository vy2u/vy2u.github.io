hi guys it's shiny and welcome back to
my channel so in today's video I'm doing
my Holy Grail lip products
I'm so excited in this video because I
love lipstick and liquid lipsticks and
lip glosses and everything like that so
I can finally share my favorites with
you so I have colors from nude to pink
to orange to red to purple all of the
colors that I've been obsessed with for
quite a while now so a lot of them are
from a map and cheechee so we have some
drugstore and some high-end so I'm going
to start with the lightest colors and
met em and work my way to the darkest
and I also have swatched all the colors
on my lip so you can see them on my lips
in real life so let's go ahead and get
started
the first combo that I have is Charlotte
Tilbury I only got this like a week ago
and hands-down would have to be one of
my favorite nude combos ever so this is
the lip cheat in the shade iconic nude
this is just a really nice neutral nude
color umm I don't even know how to
describe this it's so easy to apply your
lips it's just creamy and buttery and
it's so easy to overdraw them I love
that you can actually sharpen this
because I do have a lot of lip pencils
that you can't sharpen so you literally
get like that little stub of product and
that's all so I've been obsessed with
this and also the lipstick over the top
this is in the shade new de Kate again
just like a really nice neutral nude
color most the new colors that I have a
more on the pinky side and they bit more
warm but this is gorgeous I think it's
just different to my other new do they
have so I've been really really enjoying
this the next nude combo we have is
something you guys probably want to see
me use a hundred times ready because
I've been using this for like 3 months
now and I'm still obsessed with it so
this is the Immaculate pencil in the
shade spice Mac has it the best lip
formulas lip lipstick and lip pencil
formulas I ever used in my entire life
these would have to be the easiest ones
to use because they're so buttery and
they're just glide over your lips so
easily unlike some others that kind of
like pull when your lips and drag in
there don't look as like smooth so
obsessed with this this is a really like
warm brown color so
the perfect shade to overdraw for that
kylie jenner lip and then the lipstick
from mac in the shade velvet teddy this
is pretty much the exact same to the
spice lip pencil except a bit more on
the neutral size so I love this but it
is a little bit too like old ladyish so
I love going in with the Lancome
lipstick in the shade babbit which is
just a pink it has like all of the
velvet tell you at the bottom and I just
simply put this in the middle of my lips
to create kind of an ombre look so to
make the middle of the lips look really
big and then go back to that neutral
brown color so I've merely finished all
of this lipstick
I love Lancome lipsticks I know there
was a bit of controversy going on
between them and how they're taking
people's money I don't really know
what's going on but all I know is not to
buy Lime Crime from the store directly
maybe going to princess pullian buy it
or something but yeah this color is
amazing I don't really like white on its
own because too pink for my skin tone
but right in the middle of that lipstick
it works so well oh and this is vegan as
well so that's pretty cool oh my god and
the packaging oh so now moving on to
more of the pink tone so I've never
really been a fan of lack really intense
bright Pink's I like more of the subtle
pink so this works perfectly for me this
is the Mac lip pencil in the shade
boldly bare so this is kind of in
between the nudie Brown and the Pink's
of the right and middle right my comfort
zone and then we have the NYX butter
lipstick in the shade no cap so this is
kind of more of a sheer lipstick
compared to the others that I'm sharing
with you but you can definitely build it
up to be you know intensity that you
want intensity is that a word I really
think it is but standing on it's just a
really nice paying it's subtle and it's
kind of in-between and nude and the
paint's all still in your face like this
next pink combo I would have to say is
like the brightest pink that I would go
for I'm not really a fan of really
bright Barbie Pink's just because I feel
like that matches more like lack
features so people that have blonde hair
and blue eyes or green eyes
I feel like merely black everything on
my face so I feel like just more of like
newly muted kind of colors suit me
better so yeah this is as crazy as I'll
go this is the Mac lip pencil in the
shade edge-to-edge it is just a kind of
muted at pink it's nothing too crazy or
obnoxious and then to go with that I use
the tutu lipstick in a shade
game on as you can see it's nothing too
crazy but it is in the pink family so
I'm quite happy with this the two two
lipsticks are very very good quality I
literally have like 20 so nearly the
whole range why am I out of breath right
now I'm just talking so much let's talk
about orange lipstick I love orange
lipstick because it's not like the basic
red it's something a little bit
different and not many people wear it
but I think everyone needs to get this
this is the chichi in the shade status
it is incredible it's so different and
unique and just one swipe it looks like
this and I also have the MAC lipstick in
the shade my range which is very very
similar the formulas on both of them are
very very good but as tempting towards
the chichi one for some reason and then
to outline my lips I just use the Ruby
woo in acting bang Ruby woo by Mac this
is actually a bright red but I find that
it kind of works for the status like I
just outlined my lips with this what
this says on top and then blend it
together and you can't even see this I
always like going in with a lip pencil
just because it creates a really nice
and really nice shaping lips it's really
neat so I don't think having a lip
pencil that is exact color is really
necessary but yeah this is all I've got
so I make it work okay so now time for
the staple red I always use my Mac in a
shade rooby-roo but I left that at my
friend's house because I work clubbing
last weekend you guys need to check out
the macro blue if you haven't already
about something that's very similar to
it is the choo-choo in the shade contest
it's a really nice deep red I just think
it's the red that everyone loves it's
just very staple and you can't go wrong
with that and then the lip liner they
use is the Ruby woo so this one is the
red that matches basically every red
that I have in there I always just blend
it in with a lipstick and it always
works well so I think this is a good lip
liner to have in your collection
if you guys are game enough to wear a
really dark lip I have some amazing
products I love dark lips because it
makes the teeth look really white and
this looks really different like
seriously how many people do you see
walking the street with a dark lip I
just think it looks incredible so the
lip liner that I always use when I have
a dark lip is the Mac in a shade night
north it's just a deep dark purple and
it goes with every dark lipstick or lip
gloss or anything that I have so this is
always handy to have in your collection
if you like dark lips so the first one
that I have is the chichi Anna shade at
let me tempt you so this is a gorgeous
really dark purple like berry shade in
the bullet it looks nearly black but
once you put it on it looks in same so
this stuff is great and the next product
that I have is Chi Chi as well and we
show you to turn me on this is kind of
more of a wearable color so if you're a
bit intimidated by the other one that I
just showed you this one is amazing as
well so I'll just say it's a few shades
lighter and a bit more on like the pinky
kind of side it's not as deep and purple
as the other one this one is also
amazing I keep saying like amazing great
people get annoyed at that now time for
my favourite of all which is the lone
chroma Velva teens I have two shades
right here that I wear all the time I
would have to say this is suitable for
special occasions like clubbing or even
if you want to kiss someone because it's
non-transferable it will not come off
all night it won't transfer into
something you won't transfer onto your
clothes it just has the best staying
power the best colour payoff so I have a
shade sue berry that's how you pronounce
it this is a gorgeous Coralie red color
I wear this like every time I want to a
red lipstick when I go out to a special
occasion because when I wear other red
lipsticks it gets on my teeth or it
fades when I eat it comes off and it's
really annoying so I always late for
this one even though I have like 100
other red lipsticks this stuff is just
what I lean for all the time and then
the shade of wicked which is a gorgeous
purpley maroon color which is what I
have on my lips right now I wear this
all the time I don't even know what else
to say about this but this is incredible
so there we have my favorite lipsticks
of all time hopefully you guys found
this helpful I'm obsessed with lipsticks
I literally have it so many in my
collection but they would have to be the
ones that just stand out to me the ones
are the best for their buck I would
definitely recommend literally every
single product that I shared with you
today all as Magpies going past my room
all just really great quality so I hope
you guys have an amazing day and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
