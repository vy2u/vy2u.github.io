using
hello my chickens and welcome to my
channel sorry in today's video I really
wanted to play around with some colored
makeup like colored eyeshadow I want to
highlight and all that because I just
got a package that has all these pretty
shades in it here I'm so excited because
in today's video I'll be collaborating
with Rimmel London as part of their new
trend drop series so their trend this
month is like lots of pastel I'm gonna
do like a really nice colorful as I said
just like crazy look you guys are gonna
be a little shook with what I'm doing
first but I really need my eyebrows to
be light up because I want to put on a
wig at the end I look oh my god I look
so silly when I do this but it just has
to happen because I've had my brows
tattered on so they're really really
really dark be able to wear a wig I need
to do oh my god I don't know why i did
this.first now you guys are gonna be so
distracted okay so let's move on to the
eyeshadow so I'm gonna go in with the
Rimmel London magnifies color Edition
eyeshadow palette right here and my eye
is just stuck on this blue color right
here that is incredible I'm just gonna
start by putting this in my crease so
you don't need to be neat with this step
I'm just basically pulling this in my
crease no.1 this to be the main focus by
the way this palette right here is in
the shade color edition zero is very
full I'm going in with this palette here
which is the same one as before but a
different color range this one is in the
shade zero zero two blush edition so I'm
just gonna pick up this Brown Turner
right here and I'm gonna use that to
blend out that blue just a smidge I'm
just keeping a very light hand with this
cuz I don't want to bring the blue up
any higher that blend it out really
really nicely so now it's time for the
cut crease I'm gonna go in with some
concealer and
I'm gonna cut the whole thing Ashley
okay so now that I've done that I'm
gonna go in with the Rimmel London
madness eyes this is a holographic a
shutter and face highlighter so this
one's in the shade 0 to 2 and minted me
to your medial the color looks
absolutely amazing it's like a really
nice and mint green like pearly shade so
I'm gonna pop this all over my lid just
feel like this would be a nice color to
see underneath that blue I'm also gonna
bring it out here because I will clean
up that eye shadow and it's gonna look
like a wing it'll be good
okay sorry it is time to go ahead and
clean up this line I'm gonna make a nice
winged liner
Oh oh my god I was wondering why my eyes
stinging and this is literally a dead
I'll wat now it is time for the eyebrows
finally so I'm just gonna go in and
shape my brows how they are naturally
but with a lot of shade that I usually
use this is so weird because I could
only see my natural hairs not where my
brows have been like tattooed on okay
it's definitely not the best brows I've
ever done just because there's so much
consider in there and I feel like I
can't clean up underneath the brow
moving on to the foundation I'm going in
with the Bourjois healthy mix of fonder
tint
anti fatigue foundation this one is in
the shade why they always hidden
although we go
56 gosh I'm just gonna give it a good
shake and then the color is amazing I
could really tell when it was in the
back of my hand feel like for you guys
are gonna be happy with this color match
cuz I'm wanting something wrong this
feels so nice and just like thin on my
face I've no
a foundation with its consistency wow it
smells good too I was so excited to
finish off the eyes I'm loving how
they're looking so I'm gonna go in with
the Rimmel London magnifies luna lilac
zero trees this one's like a really
pretty
violet II lilac shade so that one's
going on my lower lash line from outer
corners in a corner I'm actually shook
that this works as an eyeshadow and a
highlighter I'm gonna try one of these
shades for my highlight so you can see
what that looks like but it's so big
minted okay so next I'm gonna go in with
this palette again and I'm just gonna
take this first color here just to
highlight my inner corners a little bit
the next thing that I'm gonna do is go
in with this a Wonder ombre holographic
effect eyeliner from Rimmel so there's a
few different shades that you can get
but I'm gonna choose the one that has
like the iridescent like perfectly white
on one side and the other side it's like
a darker purple so you can do this for
like a winged liner obviously like on
your upper lid but I want to do it on my
waterline just because we obviously have
a lot going on right here so I'm just
gonna start with the lighter shade and
I'm gonna put that from a half way to my
inner corner and then I'm gonna go with
a purple side just on the outer corner
I'm gonna blend it in to that latter
shade so we can make a nice ombre no it
is time for the mascara so I'm taking
the covergirl Turtle tazed mascara and
I'm just gonna Curt my top and bottom
lashes but I'm gonna put some falsies on
anyways after I just want to make my
lashes really black I really like this
one as well because it has like this
butterfly little head and well once you
close out a butterfly and probably not
but this is like a little a little bit
on the end that is really easy to get
into all the lashes
I feel like lashes just make everything
look so much better I'm actually really
enjoying how it's looking so far so
let's go ahead and move on to the
bronzer I'm just gonna stop warming my
whole face up
I want quite a bit of color on my cheeks
and like around my face just because
like this is so light the shadow on my
eyes it's like that pastel color and I'm
just gonna bring this around my forehead
I'm sorry happy that I don't have to do
my hair I can literally just chuck it in
a wig cap and call it a day I'm excited
to show you guys this week as well
because you missed it oh my Coachella
vlog if you haven't seen that you should
go check it out I'll leave the link down
below of course I'm just gonna add a
touch of blush to the apples of my
cheeks and they don't blend it back a
little bit I'm so excited to go with a
highlight oh my god so for the highlight
I'm gonna use that I shutter and
highlighting powder that I was using
before but this one's a different shades
in this shade of blush orbit 0:23 so I'm
just gonna go in with this product
it's stunning
so iridescent I love it this is like
perfect for a festival like if only I
put this much effort in when I actually
went to a festival I feel like I always
just like leave so light
I just love sleeping in so my way she
was like extra sleep over like nice
makeup that's so pretty
oh my god I'm also gonna go in with the
yellow one as well this one's in the
shade gilded marina I feel like this is
kind of like a Goldy champagne e shade
at the same time as being yellow so I
feel like it'll add just a little bit
more of Lac curly look to it I feel like
I should do a colored lip just because
like it would be cool to go all out but
I feel like a new look so much better
off I just stopped doing dirt let's do
this
for the lipstick I'm gonna go in with
the bourgeois rusev
Rouge velvet the lipstick in the shade
three well you didn't see that one
coming huh oh oh my god this actually
feels like a lip balm it's sorry soft
I'm gonna make a bit of an ombre lip
lighten it up a bit lighter shade all
right guys it is time it support my week
on I'm so excited oh my god all right so
it's gonna put my wig cap on first which
I don't know if is awake a bit like here
looks like a sock but what about that's
what the lady gave me when I bought it
it's definitely a sock isn't it who's
ready oh okay maybe maybe I'm not ready
cuz it's just not going on oh there we
go
Michael asked if you can use my wigs and
a mic on it's just not gonna fit in your
head like if this is tight on me it's
just not gonna work for you well it's
like a Barbie oh ok guys so here we have
the finished makeup look in here I'm
actually so obsessed with how it turned
out I definitely want to wear this to
the next festival that I go to because
when I went to Coachella I would like I
put it on my Kiner I'm gonna wear it I
even did my brows like really lot but I
just never ended up wearing because I
felt like it looked kind of fake like I
ran this sorry but as long as I push
this down I feel like it looks really
good and for you guys wondering um I got
it in America I don't even know what the
Shelf is there but it was just like on
the strip of the Hollywood Walk of Fame
apparently there's like a million around
there's only like 150 bucks or I'm happy
it's super long true anyways I love you
