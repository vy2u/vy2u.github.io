channel in today's video I'm doing my
fitness routine I'm so excited because
this has been a one of the most
requested videos ever and just a quick
little disclaimer I'm not a professional
this is just the return return the
return oh my god I can't even say that
this is just the routine that works for
me so first things first I want to talk
about how I keep motivated because I
find that keeping motivated is one of
the hardest things when it comes to
exercising so let's go so a few months
ago I asked you guys on Instagram to
give me a few motivational tips because
I was really struggling and
overwhelmingly a lot of people
recommended an app called pump up the
pump up app is a free app that is like
Instagram for fitness so you post all of
your fitness photos and you can even log
in with the activities that you do so it
has all of the workouts ready for you
from infants to beginner and what you do
is you go ahead and choose how long you
want to work out for so whether it would
be a short workout for 20 minutes or a
really long workout for 90 minutes and
also lets you choose your training goals
whether you want to get healthy and lose
weight get toned and all that good stuff
so I really like how you can modify it
and suit it to your needs
I've just been it really obsessed with
that app lately so what I've done is
I've gone ahead and picked out my
favorite exercises from the app and kind
of made it into my own routine so I
would definitely recommend checking that
out it has just been a so motivational
and let's get into the video okay so the
first thing that I like to do is go
ahead and just do some basic stretching
I find that stretching is extremely
important as it helps reduce the muscle
soreness aching muscles is never fun so
I don't ever miss a step I'm extremely
unflexible at the moment so at this
point in time I was like dying inside
and why not have a little dance before
you exercise now I'm pulling out a towel
war bottle and my phone to have next to
me while I do some core work so this is
the part where I'm try and develop some
nice-looking ABS but I don't know if
that'll ever happen so time for music as
soon as those headphones into my ears I
know it's time to get going
music is literally my Savior when it
comes to working out I'm starting off
with it 20 sit-ups I would definitely
say that sit-ups is my favorite core
workout and seriously every time I do
them I end up at the bottom of the yoga
mat every single time now time for some
planks I find this one quite dreadful if
you ask me but I find it really
effective I'm just holding this one for
90 seconds and then I'm moving on to the
dead fish well I doubt that's what it's
actually called but I mean it looks like
a dead fish I'm just doing a 20 on each
side and I find this one really great
for the ABS and back and the last thing
that I like to do for my core workout is
just 20 lady push-ups I try to do the
proper push-ups but my arms are just so
weak and then of course I go ahead and
have a break because you have to stay
hydrated and I always check my phone
which is kind of a bad habit
moving on I'm just having a quick little
stretch before I go for my run and I
mainly stretch my legs to make sure they
don't hurt too much the next day time
for some cardio so I usually start by
walking slowly and make my way into a
quick jog or even a run and I usually do
this for about 20 minutes
I find that going for walks and runs
outdoors is extremely refreshing it's
like the perfect time to clear your mind
and they also feel as though running is
like the biggest escape from reality
it's just such a good feeling not having
to worry or think about anything and not
to mention running releases endorphins
to make you feel relieved and happier
anyways now time for a lower body
workout I'm starting off with 30 squats
to keep my built a in shape so I'm
making sure to keep my back nice and
straight and girl I was feeling the burn
time to whip out that yoga mat again I'm
now doing 20 burpees and this one is a
big pain in the ass because you're
basically laying down and getting back
up over and over again but I really like
it and now doing some high knees I do
this one for one minute and then I
follow up with some butt flicks for
another minute and the last thing that I
like to do is have a little warm down
don't forget to stretch after workout as
well as beforehand it is just as
important so there we have it that is
all for my workout routine I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video after I film
this I went home and had a nap because I
was so buggered I'm gonna try my best to
stick to this routine as long as I can
because I just love the feeling after
working out and that is also I have to
say so I'll speak to you very soon bye
guys I'm using these simple kind of skin
um moisturizing cream girl get it
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
