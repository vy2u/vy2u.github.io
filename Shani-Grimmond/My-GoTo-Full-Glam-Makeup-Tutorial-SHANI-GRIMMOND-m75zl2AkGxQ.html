is taking my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
this stuff is incredible it cancels out
the discoloration on the eyelids and
also makes the eyeshadow stay on a lot
longer
this one is drying up because I've had
it for like a year now so I will have to
rebuy another one so now taking these
Smashbox a little contour palette I'm
taking the light shade and just setting
my eye base with that so it's not tacky
anymore now taking my makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade up cake this is a
beautiful pinky brown color it is
honestly so stunning so this is going to
be the transition shade I'm just
blending this in windshield wiper
motions on my favorite blending brush
from morphe I will leave the name of it
down below because it has a hundred
numbers and letters on it and trust me
to not remember it because I have a
memory like a fish
oh yes and as per usual I'm cleaning up
that eyeshadow with a little bit of
micellar cleansing water and a q-tip and
then to deepen up that crease I'm taking
a shade country girl from makeup pick
this is a few shades darker than the one
that we use as a transition so I'm
really focusing this on my crease to add
some more depth so again just taking us
in windshield wiper motion and can I
just say something that is completely
irrelevant to this whole makeup tutorial
but my little sister has a guinea pig
and as I'm done with voiceover it's like
scratching around in its little cage and
it's so annoying making a lot of noise
just to be a guinea pig like come on
time for the lid shade so I'm taking an
iridescent eyeshadow from makeup geek
this is honestly so beautiful definitely
one of my favorite iridescent shades so
in some lighting it's like
pinkey peachy color and then in other
ladies you can see a lot of gold reflux
in it oh my god honestly it is through
freaking gorgeous anyway I should start
now so now I'm taking cherry cola this
is a dark burgundy purpley color so this
is going in the crease once again just
deepening that up just to add some more
craziness to the look because I love a
dramatic look and I think this is
perfect for the full time but I mean is
spring here in Australia and this is
what I'm rocking so hello so giving that
eyeshadow one last blend I do edit out a
lot of me blending so do keep that in
mind when you're doing your eyeshadow it
does take a lot of blending so taking my
mac fix+
I'm just spraying that on a pencil brush
and putting that lid color all over once
again just because the color payoff
wasn't as nice as I'd like it but as
soon as you spray this stuff on your
brush it looks incredible so I would
recommend getting big mac fix+ it makes
all eyes shadows look 100 times better
time for foundation I'm taking my
Charlotte Tilbury this is the light
Wonder this one does have a pretty light
coverage but you can build it up if you
do like a full coverage like me so I'm
applying this with a Beauty Blender it
is a beautiful show that it matches my
fake tans perfectly it does have a
really really pretty like luminous
healthy finish so I really do love this
foundation and yeah very impressed
just like my second time using it I
think
you
and now taking my NYX HD concealer I'm
using this to get rid of those ugly
purple things under my eyes what even is
that
so just highlighting my face with this
as well since it is a really nice light
shade so blending out with a Beauty
Blender if you guys do not have a Beauty
Blender I would suggest getting one
they're very good and then setting that
all down with a light banana color if I
don't do this my concealer creases no
matter what concealer I'm using so this
is a must for me don't add too much
though because then it will accentuate
your wrinkles so just patting this on
lightly and then setting the rest of my
face with some powder holy heavens it is
finally time to fix up these brows so
I'm taking my Anastasia brow duo this is
in the shade dark brown so just really
over during my eyebrows today I hadn't
done my makeup bold and crazy for a
really long time so yeah I just drew
them on pretty chunky monkey I always
set my brows with some eyebrow gel I
don't know why I just cannot do my
eyebrows without it and just letting you
know the eyebrows don't look that crazy
at the end when I have big black lashes
on the stuff just let me know if you're
freaking out so now taking the shade
cupcake again and just running this on
my lower lash line all the way over the
whole entire thing
once again taking the shade cherry cola
so this is just going to deepen up that
eyeshadow even more I did feel like this
was necessary just because the top is
pretty dark and I just wanted to even
out the bottom lashline so just taking
this to the middle of my eye I don't
want to bring it all the way across
because I don't feel like looking like a
raccoon today maybe another day now
taking the shade Rapunzel by makeup geek
I'm soso and ease and we'll makeup you
because I love too much so this is a
really nice yellowy champagne highlight
I did not realize how people until it
was so yes I do have a little time
highlight so using this to highlight my
brow bone and also my inner corners oh
my god orgasm this is the most beautiful
eyeliner look how gold that is this is
from colour-pop I'm pretty sure they
just released them they sent me all of
them and only fell off my seat when I
got them so pigmented they last for a
really long time on the waterline so
just apply that and then I'm taking
summit mascara surges popping this on my
lashes I like my lashes through the
thick and super chunky and then of
course I'm going to take some falsies
after and just pop them on and I'll be
ready to go nearly so I took some black
eyeliner and line my lash band just so
it wasn't visible and it turned it's a
really nice dark purple color because
the eye shadow on the lid is iridescent
so I may change color which I thought
was really cool and now taking some
mascara on my bottom lashes this is the
better than sex truth base mascara now
time to contour I'm taking my NYC smooth
skin
bronzer and just putting this in the
hollows of my cheeks on a little tiny
stippling brush
time to add some bronzer so I'm taking
the betty lou manizer by the balm I'm
just using this on my cheeks to make it
super glowy this is pretty shimmery but
it's not over-the-top it's just a really
nice like subtle Sheen to the face love
it now I have a cream blush in the shade
orgasm from NARS I've got this as like a
little sample when I went to Mecca when
I bought like a hundred things the other
day and I freaking love it it is so
pretty it adds so much like youth to
your face and it just looks really
healthy and glowy so definitely would
recommend this is a really pretty color
as well I'm in now but roll boopie oh my
god that reminds me of school these days
who's going to school ease let me know
in the comments
anyway spectral tutorial I'm taking me
nods highlighted in the shade albatross
putting this on the high points of my
face because damn I love a little
highlights for the lips it is time to
purge all these bad boys so this is a
Mac lip pencil in the shade boldly fair
it's a nice neutral pink a medium pink
color it is stunning so just really
making my lips look fake I'm kidding
making them look plump that's the wetter
more people
and now taking a nude lipstick from the
bomb how pretty is that so this is
awesome because it makes your lips feel
really tingly and how they can mint
smell to it so no more bad breath if you
have minty lips so that is all for this
tutorial I hope you guys loved it and
I'll see you in my next video and please
give it a thumbs up bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
