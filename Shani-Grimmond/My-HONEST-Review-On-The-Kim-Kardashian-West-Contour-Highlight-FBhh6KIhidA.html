channel so I'm really happy to be back
right now sitting down playing around
with some makeup so today I'm the I'm
going to reviewing the Kim
kardashian-west beauty powder contour
and highlight kit this one is in the
shade medium and then we also have the
cream highlight and contour sticks right
yes or Michael actually bought these and
I stole them from his house because I
don't really want to buy this stuff
because I've already got a really good
highlighting tool palettes and I'm just
not giving into the raves anymore about
like celebrities makeup products I just
want to buy stuff that's actually really
good
but this could be really good and I'm
really excited to see how it goes so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
reviewing well I guess the first step is
to do my makeup and leave the contouring
his face is free so I'll be right back
okay so my base is done nice and
flawless oh my god why does that happen
do you guys ever notice this in my
videos they're just like oh okay see you
later okay so this one is the light
contour stick so on this side we have
more of a like cool tone and this side
we have a warm turn ish so what I'm
going to do is start with more of the
elect contrary shade so I don't really
want to draw it straight on my face
because I feel like that's just gonna
take my foundation straight off so I'm
gonna go in with a brush that it comes
with and just kind of like bounce it on
my face oh my god it just sorry Michael
it literally just like detached itself
wow my god if you I'm just gonna draw it
straight on because what is happening
why does this keep happening okay
know the guy okay so what I'm going to
do now is just like tap this on my face
okay no no this is sorry difficult okay
I'm gonna blend it in with a little
brush on the other side I do like that
color a lot it's not to money at all
don't forget it was because it's super
cool toned okay
I'm just gonna use the other side
because I really don't know what to
think about that right now because I can
hardly see it
now let's go in with the overrun Zia
color putting a lot on because it just
blends away into nothing I'm just gonna
Pat it so we don't meet with my makeup
around I would have to say it would
honestly be so much easier if I just
used a Beauty Blender you know like a
massive fan of the brush but it's not
horrible I think it's definitely doing
its job okay so we also have the
highlights side there's like a Yeller
and more of like a white shade right
here oh my goal that's actually
highlight like it has shimmer in it okay
so this side is kind of like a shimmery
highlight and this side is what you use
like I guess like under your eyes and
like down you nose wherever you want to
highlight so I'm just gonna put this
where I want the brightest spots to be
usually I just use can steal up this
step I'm just gonna use my Beauty
Blender for this step because it's
obviously already dirty
blending oh my god
I'm so dry okay it's kind of like hard
to find out you can still see like the
little marks as soon as I like blender
for it see that's why I like to use
concealer because concealers like sorry
so creamy so that was the lightest shade
and I do have like olive skin and that
didn't really do too much to my face but
whatever now I'm going to use the
shimmery side of the highlight stick and
I'm just gonna put it on the back of my
Beauty Blender it's kind of just like
crumbling off there okay I'm just gonna
Pat this on cuz I don't want it to like
take my foundation off like the other
one did on my nerves
oh wow that's kind of pretty I like that
I can I do think liquid illuminators are
a little bit easier to blend but this
still does look really pretty now what
I'm gonna do is set underneath my eyes
and my face so we can move on to the
contouring paradigm so
okay so my face is set now we can go in
with this palette can I just say that
this packaging is honestly amazing if I
was ever gonna come out with something
this is like the vibes that I would want
it's just so slick and so hot so this
one isn't a shade medium and this is or
what it looks like so we have more of a
contour shade a bronzy shade a pink
highlight and more of like a yellow turn
to highlight the highlights do look very
beautiful I just want to give them a
swatch oh my god
Wow they feel very buttery so the first
color I'm gonna take is this contrary
shade right here I just want to say that
this is looking very muddy and I'm
really not impressed with that at all I
would not purchase this myself and I'm
glad that I didn't but let's just see
how this contour palette go so I'm going
to tap off any excess because I don't
want it to be true muddy I'm gonna have
to keep this nice and light I'm just
gonna put a little bit of this right
where I put that cream contour okay
that's very pigmented very pigmented
holy okay the brightness is like way to
like that's better that's more like real
life color okay this is what it's
looking like so now I'm gonna go in with
this color right here which is a very
strange looking bronzer color but it
could look nice in the skin so I'm
taking a stippling brush and going into
town oh my god I actually love it like
first impression it's orange and I love
orange cheeks oh you're definitely gonna
have to bake underneath this contour
because it's just going everywhere my
bad
maybe bit careless aren't we I'm gonna
put this around my hairline as well so
it can really bronze up the whole face
but this color I'm actually like so
impressed with this is something that I
would use on a regular basis the formula
of this is really good as well like it's
super creamy it's blending out really
nicely and I'm gonna put someone to heal
I personally don't really even like
contouring my face anymore just because
it like always looks muddy I always like
to use a warm tone to contour my skin
and that's just how it is now so if you
do like cool tones maybe this would work
for you or the cool tone shades in here
but because it is so muddy I'm just
gonna take my try
Lucent pada and bike under Jia so we can
really clean it up and have better
representation of what it looks like I
like to brush it off pretty quickly
because I don't want it to be too strong
I'm just taking my powder brush so that
looks good I really like that orange
bronze oh okay now let's take the pink
highlight shade at type of excess and go
into town oh my god oh my god this is
amazing that's so intense like why
didn't like him give Kylie some tips
with her highlights because how are you
have way too much on I never thought
that would happen oh my god well yeah if
I put less on it would look less ashy my
dad oh oh that one's very much better
see how this color is like Molech Goldy
yellow I feel like that's a lot better
for my skin tone than this because this
one's kind of like I feel like would be
better for paler skin tones cuz on me it
kind of looks a she and gray like it
definitely is a champagne highlight but
I can just see like a bit of concrete
shade in there you know what I mean but
that's that's pretty cool this color is
amazing I also really like that these
highlights are very very finely milled
so they don't look anything like the
jeffree star highlights or like you know
the really chunky thick textured
highlights which can be really cool
sometimes but these ones are very very
fine so I think really good especially
if you have like textured skin eyes like
these would work really well for me
there's no blending out of it cuz like
what do you mean
Shawny okay so let's just give an
overall review of all of these products
so in my opinion I personally would stay
a very far away from these sticks right
here I just don't think they worked as
well as like other brands that I've
tried before the contouring shades were
a little bit muddy in my opinion they
look good now because I did go over with
the warm shade it kind of just like
completely got rid of any like a she
tone so I just don't even think that's
worth it but it does blend out really
nicely that is a plus and then with the
highlighting stick the highlighting
shades were a little bit more dry than
the contouring shades so they were hard
to blend out
the highlight like the sparkly highlight
did look like pretty nice in the skin
not gonna lie but I just prefer like
really intense looking highlight so that
didn't really work for me but it would
be nice for a little bit of a glory if
you do like that so I guess you can
really like to decide depending on what
you want okay so with the brushes that
it came with I wouldn't use like the
Beauty Blender sponge kind of side this
one was all right I mean it was whatever
but I personally would rather use my own
brushes because my own brushes work a
lot better than that anyway but
considering that this is something that
I guess comes with the product it's not
as bad as like other brushes that come
with like the makeup products you know
so I didn't use this brush for the
bronzing and highlighting and all that
because like it's just not the right
size and shape for me you know like it's
just not nowhere
so with this palette right here this was
something that I was actually very very
impressed with I love this shades so
much the highlight colors are really
nice I personally don't think I would I
mean it's really pretty but I think next
time I use this color I'm gonna have to
mix it with this color because it is a
little bit ashy this color is really
nice and a lot more natural but they're
still very pigmented and in-your-face
but yeah I do think this one is a good
palette so I really hope this video
helped you guys in whether or not you
want to buy this stuff one autofit just
like was entertaining it's funny how
like all these celebrities are coming
out with their products and like I don't
know they have the power to make such
amazing products just like this like
very impressed with that but like and I
mean I mean like get some tips off I'll
be brown or something come on so if you
like this video please give it a big
thumbs up I love you guys so much and
I'll see you in my next video love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
