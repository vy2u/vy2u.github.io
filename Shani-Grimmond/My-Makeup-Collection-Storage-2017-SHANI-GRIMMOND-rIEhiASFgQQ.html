is my favorite room in the house because
I get to experiment and play with makeup
so this desk right here is where I sit
to film all of my videos so the chair is
literally just from my dining room table
setup and then we have a fluffy thing
over the top to make sure my whole like
backdrop and everything is nice and wide
that's from Ikea and then everything
pretty much on my desk is just like
brushes and my mirror so I can see
what's happening most of my brushes are
from multi makeup geek we have a few
from zoeva Real Techniques and also a
few from Mac as well there is a very
large collection but I have given away
all the brushes I don't actually use so
these ones I do use on a regular basis
and you would pass out if you knew how
long it took to clean all of these this
is pretty much the background for my
video I wanted it to look really chilled
and simple so the desk is from ikea art
well there's actually two and then on
top of it we have a lamp which is so
pretty and then we have a few plants
because I wanted to keep it like nice
and green so it looks really fresh and
alive and of course I have a candle as
well because they can't go a day without
lighting candles
this one's from glass house and it
smells absolutely beautiful my favorite
one is in the flavor caramel but I
wanted to get a white one so it looks
better and then we have my jewelry box
this is half of what I have the rest is
in my room but this is just pretty much
of stuff I wear most of the time and
then under the desk we have stuff that
pretty much just needs to be stored away
so this big box is stuff that sent to me
and I've got to try out and see how it
goes
keep you guys updated and then any other
one we have like fan mail and oh my god
are you kidding this was sent to me it's
horrible I've had it for like a year I'm
just like I'm literally keeping it
forever this person is so talented I
love you guys so much we also have a
like photos of my friends and my family
and stuff in that little box so over
here we have a mirror I've had this one
for like five years I'm literally going
to buy a new one tomorrow so I'll show
you my new one or so turret
this is where I keep all of my makeup I
have a two drawers from Ikea I just
stacked on top of each other I feel like
everyone has these same drawers because
they just carry everything so well on
top of that we have a true lipstick
containers and I'm really pretty buzzed
with some flowers in it this first one
is from lip stack it just holds so many
lipsticks and because I have a million
it's absolutely perfect we have some
Urban Decay lipsticks they literally
sent me their whole range I'm so lucky
then we have some Charlotte Tilbury
versus colors mellow and a bunch of
other brands and then on top of that we
have all of my lip balms I have a little
collection up here because my lips are
dry all the time so the next lip
container that we have is from Lady Moss
and this contains all of my liquid
lipsticks all of the top ones here are
from Jeffrey star I have pretty much all
of his wearable colors because the
formula is that good we have some food a
beauty we have banned minerals and
Nastasia NARS Milani hunt we have it all
so the next one we have all of my red
lipsticks and looking at this I'm just
like I need to wear red lips more often
because how beautiful are these colors
the next drawer is all of my nudes oh my
god Shannon so wrong but we have a lot
of different brands in here the next
drawer is all my purples and deep berry
tones I never usually touch this drawer
because it's not like overly wearable
but look how pretty it looks
the next drawer is all of my pinks again
I don't really wear Pink's on my lips
but I do have a lot of like Revlon and
true face and a few drugstore ones as
well
my whole collection is a massive variety
of high-end and drugstore so this is my
lip glosses oh my god I have this one
from Mac but I have to wrap up because
it leaks let's go ahead and dive into

literally a million in here like I need
to continuously go through it to make
sure they haven't dried out or like
haven't gone off or anything this one
from the balm is like absolutely
stunning I love it so much but here's
the problem why do I have so much makeup
right and then over here we have my eye
contacts I have so many but I literally
just realized the reason why I have a
 sty right now is because of these
contacts right here because I've had
them for over a year and I just for them
my bad anyways let's move to the next
draw this first compartment is my eye
primers and my glitter glue so we have

have two compartments of that because
I'm secure diner this is all my tart
shaped tapes I have a million different
shades we have Smashbox Napoleon I never
use a Napoleon but I'm like I have to
get some different brands so people
don't get bored of me using the same

don't even know why like why did I buy
this shade right here like I'm never
