in today's video I'm sharing with you my
everyday nighttime skincare routine I
take this very seriously and I think
everyone should because we all have to
take care of our skin so first thing
obviously I'm going to clip up my hair
so we can take this face off let's do
this I would have to say one of the most
satisfying feelings ever is pulling my
lashes off at the end of the day it just
feels so good so make sure you put them
in a safe place because I know how easy
it is to lose those little Fluffy's to
remove my makeup I use the general logic
art pre cleanse and this is basically
like an oil that breaks down over the
makeup on your face I really like to
stay clear from any makeup remover wipes
or anything like that just because it
does suck out all the natural oils in
your face and this is just like the
safest way to remove makeup obviously in
the occasion I do use makeup removing
wipes because it is a lot easier and
quicker and it's not as messy but at the
end of the day I do want to use what is
best for my skin and this definitely is
a lot better than wipes
now it's time to wash away all of that
makeup and move on to the most important
part which of course is cleansing you
want to make sure you go to bed with
absolutely nothing on your face no
bacteria no makeup so the cleanser that
I like to use is the Hoover bead facial
cleanser this stuff is amazing
especially for my skin because I do have
quite dry skin and it's nice and gentle
but it still cleanses it really well the
system that I like to use to cleanse my
face is the ultimate skin sparked by a
vanity plant I use this every single
night it is in my religion it's amazing
so it has three different heads that you
can choose to kind of suit your skin so
that's one for everyday use there's an
exfoliating brush for like a deep
cleanse which is probably best to do
maybe once a week and then there's a
silicon brush which is best for dry and
sensitive skin which is what I have
that's why I use this one every day
super gentle so what I do is I just rub
it in for about a minute to make sure
there's no like bacteria or dirt or
makeup left in there you guys know I
would never promote anything that I
don't generally love so I decided to get
you guys a discount code it for 70% off
which means that this system will come
down to $38 which was so cheap the code
that you can use is shiny spin I will
leave all of that information down below
if you guys are interested in buying it
but that is so cheap I have used one
what was it like the Clarisonic before
and I was like $300 oh my god that's
expensive so I'm really glad I managed
to get a discount card for you guys
because these things can be super super
expensive then with the leftover
cleanser I just like to run over my eyes
with my finger to get rid of any mascara
or eyeliner or anything like that
I just like to be super gentle here
because obviously that skin is very
delicate so just washing away all of the
makeup off my skin spa and putting it
back in its little travel case to make
sure inner bacteria goes near it
the next product that I absolutely adore
is the origins never a dull moment face
polisher this stuff is so incredibly
thick and just makes your face feel so
nourished and healthy and glowing after
so I rub this in for about 20 seconds
just massage it really gently and when
you wash it off your face will feel like
a baby's bottom you guys need to try
this if you have normal to dry skin it
is next level good now it is time for a
face mask so this one is so runny that
it's so typical of me to do something
like that this one is called epoch I
think that's how you pronounce it I'm
not even too sure we can purchase it
from because I got it sent to me
randomly in my period box but I'm gonna
do some research and try and put the
link down below because it actually is
really really good I really like it
because the consistency is super runny
so it's just so easy to blend it it's
quick and it dries in about 10 minutes
it leaves my face feeling super soft and
just it pulls out all the impurities and
blackheads and stuff so it's great it's
not that often that I come across a face
mask that I love this much so really
quickly I want to talk about how much
water I drink I drink at least five or
six of these bottles a day that is the
key to making your face
super clear and glowy so ghazal that
bottle down honey
take it seriously once your face starts
to feel super tight and you can't even
smile that's when you know it's time to
wash it off watching this back it's like
oh my god I can't wait to do my next
mask it's just the most refreshing
feeling so my face feels super dry after
any time I wash it or anything so I've
got to add that moisture back into it so
this is the Elizabeth Arden capsules
it's kind of like a beauty oil so it
really just puts so much moisture into
your skin so this is the first step I
just rub this all in my god this product
is expensive but it is really good it
makes my face just feel incredibly soft
and moisturized and it dries to a matte
finish as well so it's not oily next
step is moisturizer I'm taking my simple
kind of skin rich moisturizing lotion so
this is as thick as I can go when it
comes to a moisturizer because I cannot
stand like sleeping on my pillow and
then I lift my head up and I'm stuck to
it because my moisturizer is that thick
so this one does absorb really nicely
into the skin
and a bit and it's super cheap as well
so to moisturize under my eyes I use any
eye cream really the one that I'm using
now is the benefit it's potent you want
to make sure you're using something nice
and thick to really hydrate under there
because that skin is so incredibly
delicate so do not skip this step to
moisturize my lips I'm using my
chapstick night repair I use this every
single night and I wake up in the
morning and my lips feel incredible it
just lasts all night even if you're a
mouth-breather you'll wake up with wet
lips still is amazing so now I'm going
to take my hydrating a rosewater mist
and I'm just going to spritz my face
because I'm so excessive and I just love
lots of hydrating products on my skin I
love this step this is what my skin
looks like when I'm finished with it it
honestly takes less than five minutes
and it is the most important five
minutes of my day so make sure you step
up your game if you don't have a
skincare routine but make sure you at
least cleanse and moisturize so I hope
this video helped you out a lot I will
leave all the information about what
pilum on and start because that
definitely has a massive part in my
skincare routine my doctor prescribed me
with this one in particular to clear up
my acne from my hormones so yeah I'll
leave all that information down below I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will see you very soon bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
