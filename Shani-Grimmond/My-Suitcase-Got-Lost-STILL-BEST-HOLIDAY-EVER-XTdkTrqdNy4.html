right now it is literally the most
amazing place I have ever been in my
life so we have a little bit of a
dilemma my suitcase and Michael's
suitcase got lost on the way so we
literally don't have any of our stuff
all I have is the stuff that I hadn't
liked my little carry-on bag so I'm
using other people's clothes and makeup
and stuff which is it's sort of
hard but I'm just trying to work with
what I've got at the moment and it's
kind of like you can't be sad when
you've got a view like this this is
where I want to live like wow sir I just
got ready to do a little oh wow we do a
little shoot upstairs doing like the
group photo now sorry it's gonna be
gorge the fan is here we're about to go
in with the wood I keep Michael look um
how do you feel about the suitcases hon
not happy no I actually think this is
like so cute that we went shopping on
the first day and like it's working love
it okay so we got all about photo
I'm gonna now we're at lunch beautiful
door chicken pasta but this is what it
looks like yeah everyone's just ordering
there's like that looks like my
after a butter chicken help I want
everything I said sorry 10 is gonna live

Michael literally put a pillow in
between us he doesn't want me to touch
him like these serious I just said I'm
coming I'm sorry okay that's sweet
potatoes gonna say that's definitely a /
up lamb sorry Wow sir I'm just looking
at older quarters that we were taking
before oh my god
surprise but my euro I mean I think
that's it you're also not entirely sure
but it looks so yummy
I got my free blast I'm so sad we just
checked into the new hotel and this is
like I know I keep saying this but like
the most amazing place like look at this
look at the view like are you kidding me
am I dreaming I feel like I am look what
Michael just brought to my door wait you
have to see my reaction hello hello
hello sorry
yesterday I literally forgot to take my
vlogging camera into Michael's room but
I went into Michael's room and we
ordered room service and we will
actually got like seven or eight plates
of food because we were so hungry so he
ordered it at like 10 and then it wasn't
there at 12 so he called me like look
we've been waiting two hours like what's
going on this is insane like wilshire
hungry by this time and then she's like
ah we never put an order through so we
had to like reorder I'm cuz we're so
hungry we order like a lot more so it
was just like no it was just not a good
time like I was so full I just need to
like take a step back and relax but so
this is the first day where I actually
have like all of my clothes all of my
makeup so I feel so much better now that
I have my stuff because using everyone
else's stuff was like so hot I hate
being annoying and like going in and
using people's stuff like it's just not
it just don't mean we're supposed to be
meeting up at 12 o'clock but everyone's
like all the time and I don't want to
wait well 10 it's late all the time I
don't want that blank so I'm just gonna
wait until everyone else gets there but
everyone has been so nice like I'm
literally obsessed with everyone here
it's such a nice little group
the only thing about Mykonos is way
literally here at the wrong time we're
supposed to be here in like two months
by like everyone else comes and it's
like potties and stuff because like you
guys know like I love to potty
but it's like nerve potting at the
moment like this is literally like
hardly anyone here but maybe it's a good
thing that we're coming now and it's
kind of like quiet because it's sorry
like there's like no one here so you can
like see everyone you can get photos
with are in the background like you can
just see everything without it
like a massive crowd but it would be
cool to come back when it's like party
vibes and there's like just like heaps
of people like that's just like my type
of place

don't know what does like as soon as my
suitcase got here just like blew up and

I'm centering my music I'm sweating like
tell you guys what happened today sir
today was honestly incredible it was so
nice to hang out with everyone and just
like relax and actually have like really
genuine conversations with everyone and
like not just be like Instagram photos
and stuff because like obviously that's
like the whole point of these trips is
to like sorry I just like right up the
stairs I'm like sorry puffed the whole
point of like this trip is to like for
everyone to like kind of grow like help
each other and stuff but to be honest
like I don't really care about like
bolas and like I don't really care about
numbers and all of that like I care
about genuine conversations and people
with people and genuine friendships and
stuff like obviously this is like my job
and I would love to grow even more but
like what's more important to me is like
having real friendships sir it was so
nice to talk to like Gabby she's like
honestly the sweetest girl in the world
like I am obsessed with her she is just
so genuine and so is everyone else but
like we really had a great chat like
she's seriously um but yeah I'm so
exhausted
oh okay so while I was in the shower I
was kind of thinking about what I was
saying before and I just wanted like
speaking about a bit more sir um what I
meant by like I don't care about photos
I can feel kind of bad cuz like it
doesn't mean like I don't care about you
guys I mean I don't care like utter
ain't how do I say this like I don't
care if someone has 500 subscribers five
subscribers or five million subscribers
you want I mean like I'm gonna treat
everyone the exact same and like I
care if you have X amount of photos like
it doesn't mean anything to me like
obviously like you guys mean so much to
me and like all your support means so
much to me but like at the end of the
day like the amount of like people
following someone like doesn't make me
treat someone differently just someone
that doesn't you know what I mean like
that's what I mean like I don't care
about like I don't care about that stuff
like I care about you guys but I don't
care about a number or like someone
being better than someone because of the
amount of followers that they have you
don't I mean like that's that's what I
was trying to say good morning everyone
so we are having breakfast by the pool
today me and Michael and I just got my
break easy I'm so excited so hungry I
got pretty the view is good morning
everyone
breakfast was sorry yummy I'm just about
to do my makeup cuz we're gonna go into

career I don't like she's a bitch I feel
very obnoxious because I'm wearing a top
