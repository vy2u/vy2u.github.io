Sarai and then volley right now and I
thought what a perfect time to tell you
guys about how I keep my 10 really doc
while I'm over here or in general for
that matter because I literally ten
every single week and I need to share
with you what I do because it's
life-changing honestly I've been tanning
since I was in high school it's been a
long time I just turned 21 yesterday
it's crazy
sir I would like to do a toast to this
product because it will change your life
when in Bali please excuse the lighting
right now we're working with natural
lighting and that's always hard but the
product that I'm going to be talking
about today is from a Bondi stands it is
called the one hour Express self-tanning
foam this stuff has literally changed my
life and I want to tell you why and that
is because it dries so incredibly
quickly
it is Superdog
let's just ignore that and you can wash
it off after one hour so what I like to
do is obviously the first thing you need
to start with is scrubbing your tan off
your old tan or if you don't have any
all turn on make sure you scrub any dead
skin off so what I like to do is go in
with the self-tanning eraser and this
stuff as well has changed my life like I
don't know how I ever got my tan off
before this stuff came about so I
basically just like pump this all over
my body I leave it on for five minutes
and then I just like go in and scrub
where is it I found it so it's this
little exfoliator right here so I just
scrub all over my body while I'm in the
shower but I'll stand away from the
water so I don't wash any of this
product off and then I'll just go in
scrub my body for like one minute and it
literally comes off straight away it is
literally magic like oh and then really
importantly you want to make sure that
you let all of your pores close so I
give my skin like one hour after I get
out of the shower for my pores to close
so when I put the tan on over the top of
like wet skin like I feel like that's
when all the tango since your little
pores and you get like a little black
dots all over your body so I give it at
least an hour and then I like to go in
with some moisturizer and I moisturize
my hands my elbows my knees my feet
because there's like the dry areas that
10 really likes to cling to and it looks
super patchy so I always always do that
and then it's time to go in with this
bad boy I do have a discount card if you
guys want to save 20% off so that is
just shiny I will leave all that
information down in the description
below and then I take a decent sized
dollop on my applicator and I just go in
I don't really have a certain routine of
like what buddy Potter put it on first I
just like loaded up and I just rub it in
all over my skin and I leave my arms
elbows and hands and feet till last and
I just kind of like robbery's areas with
whatever is remaining on applicator so I
just like to take this in a little
circular motions it's like a really nice
Muricy consistency so it doesn't leave
any streaks or anything like that and
it's like a really nice brownie olive
color and I'm so obsessed and I can't
believe they came out in the product
that dries even quick all these on
dryers in like five minutes for me I
come just stand there naked like this
and I'm just like waiting for it to be
completely dry I've put on my Jackie
long pants
long top and I kind of just chill out
for a few hours so you can wear it for
one hour for like a medium to dark tan
but if you want to make it even darker
you can leave them on for like three
hours and that's what I do
sometimes I even sleep in it just
because why not I applied at nighttime
anyway another thing that I love about
this product is that it fades really
nicely on my skin so you know when you
have like a really dark tan on it starts
to crack and you can really see like oh
my god I need to take yourself right now
this one actually fades really nicely
and naturally so once I know like it's
time to fade I'm looking a bit more pale
I just go in and take this good stuff
and scrub my tan off and literally do
the whole thing all over again like you
have no idea how dedicated I am to this
tanning life it's actually kind of a
joke when I went to the reveal party for
this product I've genuinely had no idea
what the product was gonna be and I was
like how are they going to top their
last products like I have no idea but
then when I realized it was this I'm
like oh my god that's actually the most
brilliant idea ever I would have taken
them so long to create something that
drives so quickly but honestly this
stuff is incredible you guys need to try
it out and also this stuff does have
that same coconuts and that the other
products do have but another tip that I
have is make sure you moisturize
regularly when you do have your tan on
otherwise it's going to get a little bit
dry I personally have super dry skin so
my skin does get pretty dry when I do
use like any fake tan at all so I'm
always moisturizing every single day
when I do forget it does tend to like
dry up a little bit more so obviously
you want to stay nice and moist so it
lasts longer that is a really massive
tear like do not forget to do that
anyways that is my secret to how I say
it's super dark even when I'm swimming
all the time because it does last a
pretty long time when I'm sweating all
the time when going to the gym when I'm
laying in bed all the time laughs and we
evolved you're kidding me but yes I
really couldn't you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a thumbs
up I love you guys so much and I'll see
you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
