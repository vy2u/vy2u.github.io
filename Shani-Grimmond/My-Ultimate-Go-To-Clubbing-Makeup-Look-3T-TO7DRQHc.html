in today's video we are doing my go-to
clubbing a makeup club so let's go ahead
and jump right in so I always do my
brows it's super dramatic when I'm going
clubbing just because you know it's dark
no one can tell how much makeup you have
on you can really well I mean they can
but like you can get away with wearing
extra makeup so what I like to do is
extend my brow a pretty much draw a
straight line underneath it so it's
super like harsh and really neat and
then I make an arch as well because you
know the slugs need a little bit of an
arch then to conceal my brows I like to
take my top shape tape this one is my
go-to for this step it's just sort of
easy to clean up the rosen and also to
cover any veins because it is very very
high coverage so once i've done that i
like to go in with my Rimmel stay matte
powder to make sure all the eyeshadows
blend over the top of that concealer
nicely so we're going to make sure we
set that down zelf yeah yeah it is time
for the eyeshadow I'm taking the kylie
jenner burgundy palette I've only used
this a few times and I do really like it
I just never lean for it so I'm like yes
let's do this something different I mean
same colors but everyone loves warm
shades let's be real I'm starting with
this orange shade in my crease and
really blowing it up up to my eyebrow
this color is so pretty and the formula
is incredible then we're going to go in
with this maroon shade and this one is
going directly in the crease I'm going
to blow it up a little bit but not as
much as that last shade so I'll just
take a smaller blending brush so we can
focus it right in that socket girl and
the next color I'm taking is this
beautiful chocolate brown color so I'm
going to take an even smaller blending
brush and just placing that in my crease
once again but really deepening up that
crease to make it super luscious and
it's a mochi and that of course I go
back in with my big blending brush
because you always should blend up every
snap key now I'm going in with the heart
shaped head concealer once again so I
can never stay away from it I'm just
going to take a small flat shader brush
and carve out a cut crease so it'd be
very patient you'll get there eventually
I mean I still suck at it but like
whatever okay so going in with my Rimmel
stay matte powder I'll just set that
down so the other colors on top is kind
of like an even color and not like
patchy or anything so I'll go in with
that orange shade
and just pass that all over the lid
where we have that blank space still and
again I'm going back in with a chocolate
brown color and I'm using this to blend
the orange and the darker shade together
so we have a really nice gradient so
what I like to do is just take a fluffy
blending brush and kind of just like rub
over the two until it is nice and
seamless and then I'm taking my Urban
Decay act little liner
this stuff is seriously never getting it
old I love doing this so much it just
adds like a little pop of something to
the eyes without being like true
dramatic and nerd like that's dramatic
but like it's amazing like you learn
more parts so just drawing a line in my
cut crease where I left a little gap to
prime my face I'm taking this
wet-and-wild a face primer this one has
a really nice consistency it feels
really moisturizing just refreshing on
the skin
I actually really like this one oh my
god now it's time for the fun part I'm
going in with the iconic London
illuminator as you can see right here it
is so intense and creamy away what I've
been obsessed with it so what I'm going
to do is just pop this under my
foundation and also on top of my
foundation to get the best effect
because I want a really glowy skin today
and when you go clubbing you want that
light to shine it directly off your
cheekbones it is the best look gasps so
just going to blend that in with my
Beauty Blender and then I'm going in
with my clinic foundation this
foundation is so good it's actually a
joke like it really is that good
it is quite fixed so I would recommend
using a kabuki brush to blend it in but
of course I decided to do it the hard
way
it has amazing coverage and it has a
really good color range as well so I'm
quite happy with that I have a shade 8
and 11 depending on like if I want more
of a yellow tone I'll go over the 8 and
then 11 it's more of like a neutral turn
when I have a darker tan on and then for
my dark circles under my eyes I'm taking
this a Bobbi Brown corrector and I'm
just going to make sure no purple tones
are peeking through and because this
one's more of a peachy tone it just
cancels out any dark turns at all it is
really good and then over the top I'm
taking my Smashbox concealer to really
brighten everything up and make sure
Alex MatchGirl
oh my god no one does that anymore is
that so funny how like YouTube like
slang words just fall off
cos and like new ones come in like wait
what's a good one
that's like sorry lit by to set that
concealer I'm taking my Rimmel match
perfection powder and I'm just going to
pick underneath my eyes but we're not
calling anywhere near that highlighted
area with any powders so going back in
with a highlight I'm going to make it
even more intense you can definitely
build it up to like literally the most
blinding highlighter of your life so I'm
just using this one on its own and as
you can see oh my god it does so amazing
oh really consoles normal for like one
second it kills me so to set the rest of
my face I'm going in with the hello
flawless powder by benefit and just
tapping that everywhere except for my
phone I can never do my brows without
setting them I love to just push them up
so they look super full and dramatic and
fluffy just makes my whole entire life I
would definitely recommend trying this
guys it's a life changer thank you going
back in with that orange shade I'm using
this on my lower lash line so from outer
corner to inner corner to really
proportion out the eye shadow look and I
wanted to keep the lower lash line nice
and light so it doesn't look like it's
being punched in the face because my
eyes are so dark and anytime I put dark
eyeshadow on it just doesn't suit me so
on that note I'm going in with a white
eyeliner and my waterline to brighten
everything up next step is to coat my
lashes so we can prep them for the
falsies it doesn't really matter what
mascara you have on your top lashes as
long as they're super black so they
blend in with your falsies but this one
is great for the lower lashes to make
them super long under make so for the
falsies I'm taking these ones from Lily
lashes and these are in the style
goddess and hold it black oh my god
oh my god best lashes in the actual
world they're so fluffy and long I die
every time next step is to bronze up the
face so this one is a bronzer from girl
on I will leave all the shades in the
description box below this one is a
really pretty a warm turn I love warm
turns on the cheeks it just looks so
sunkissed and radiant so of course I'm
putting this under my cheekbones and
also around my forehead and then it's
time for the blush I'm taking this one
from makeup geek in the shade in
saturation this one is the perfect
neutral turn blush that will go with
literally any any makeup look now it's
time for the lips I'm taking this
Jordana lip pen
in the shade a honey dip this is one of
my favorite affordable lip pencils in
the world it's just so creamy and the
quality is amazing and it's like three
dollars or something crazy like that so
I'm going to take my Jo a lip gloss over
the top and oh my god this is like one
of my favorite lip glosses in the whole
world now I'm so happy I have found this
but what I go clubbing I always like to
do a nude lip just because you know I'm
drinking I'm dancing I don't want to
like reapply all the time so a nude is
just like the easiest thing to maintain
and like this color is like to die for I
yeah Shanno check on me right now so you
want to make sure you set your face if
you want your makeup to stay on all
night long I mean like I stay out all
night long so I definitely need some of
those up on my real girl so I hope you
enjoyed it today's video I love you guys
so so much and I'll see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
