in today's video I'm gonna be doing a
festival makeup look so Mecca has sent
me a big box of mystery makeup so I'm
just gonna be playing around with all of
these products I actually haven't used
many of them before so I'm just super
excited to see how they go this is gonna
be really fun I have so many products
here so let's go ahead and jump into the
video I just went ahead and primed my
eyelids we have so many limited edition
products to play with I'm so excited
sir I'm gonna start out with the Urban
Decay Christian lien eyeshadow palette
right here this just has a lot of
neutral tones that would be really easy
to work with so I'm gonna start with
this color right here and I'm gonna
blend this one into my crease there are
honestly so many festivals coming up I
cannot wait festivals like everything to
me I'm always so happy when I'm there
just like dancing oh my god that is very
pigmented so I'm making sure to blend
this up nice and high so we put all the
other colors on over the top we can
still see this one peeking through the
next palette that I'm gonna take is this
true face that laughs a festival peace
love and unicorns palette this is so
pretty the packaging so I haven't really
looked at this properly this is what all
the colors look like it's very colorful
the first color that I'm gonna take is
this matte pink right here I'm gonna put
this over the top of that like peachy
show that I just put down just in the
crease here oh my gosh
the next thing that I'm so excited about
is the Stila glittering glare a liquid
eyeshadow so they came out with a few
new shades and I have two right here we
have a one DeLoss this is like a goatee
peachy like iridescent I shut her and
then the other one is like this really
nice blurry so I'm just gonna swatch the
blue one first I do want to use this one
but I'm thinking if I do want to keep
with like the pinky tones they someone
to be nice cuz like a peachy pink in
there so let's see what this looks like
oh my gosh that is so pretty what the
hell Wow I don't know what one desert so
of course I'm just gonna make myself a
cut crease this is the easiest
applicator to apply it with so I'm just
gonna go in the next thing that I'm
gonna do is go in with this Too Faced
like glitter pop a peel off eyeliner
this one's in the shade of Faerie Queene
it's a really pretty purple this one's
also iridescent as lifelike everything's
gonna be iridescent in this video so I'm
just gonna line my cut crease right up
here to make it more defined and add
some more color into the whole look okay
so I just went ahead and did a wing and
lashes now I can move on to the face so
I'm gonna take the true face festival
refresh a mystical effect setting and
refreshing its ray so this one has like
a little iridescent I mean I wouldn't
call them like glitter I'd call it like
little shimmers in there I don't know
that's so cool hey let's do this I'm
gonna test the spritzer first oh my gosh
that smells incredible what the hell now
we can move on to the old girl no we can
move on to the foundation so this is the
mecca max laughs proof long-wave
foundation this one's in the shade 6-0
sand I mean I've got one shade so this
is gonna be interesting so I'm just
gonna stop blending this into my skin
I've no use its foundation before
actually now that I've blended it out I
would say that it's like more of a
medium coverage than a full coverage
because I can still see my breakouts
through here sorry about that the
coloring was so off but I just fixed my
cameras the actual shade that it is so
that is a lot better everyone says I
always look so cool in my videos but
lack something is wrong with my settings
like I am a little bit yellow but not as
yellow as I look in my video so I'm glad
but oh okay so the next thing that we
have right here is just going to shake
it up first is the Mecca maxima and
Mecca max lifeproof cream concealer in
the shade 2.5 no but I'm sorry scattered
I'm just gonna pop this underneath my
eyes to highlight and conceal let's go
ahead and blend that out well I like
that now time for the translucent powder
I'm taking the Too Faced Born This Way
setting powder and I'm just gonna bake
underneath my eyes so they can seal off
it does not budge goodbye like
everywhere because this concealer is
quite hydrating just make sure you set
it down straight away okay I'm kind of
scared with this next step I'm gonna go
in with this mecca Maxima lifeproof
super set invisible pressed powder
usually I usually I use like a
foundation powder to set my base but I'm
gonna use this one instead cuz it was in
the little mystery box I just hurt my
face isn't go wide oh yeah cool I seem
to say if that's not invisible then
we've definitely got a problem here oh
thank goodness that could've just ruined
my whole makeup it is time for the lower
lash line sir I'm gonna go in with this
Too Faced palette again and I'm gonna
take the shade a mystic rain this is
really pretty iridescent purpley silver
shade so I'm gonna take that all mine
lower lash line from a tikona all the
way to inner corner to match that purple
liner that I kind of stuffed up
that is so pretty oh my god I'm gonna go
in with the shade fantasy over the top
just on the outer corners just to deepen
it up a little bit the next thing that I
have here is the two-faced unicorn tears
highlighting sticks so I've really set
my face down so I don't know how this is
gonna go I should have done this before
but I'm just gonna put a little bit on
my finger it's just an iridescent like
purpley blue shade I'm just gonna Pat
this on my cheekbones up here I'm using
my finger just salt like melts into the
skin yeah if you are gonna use this make
sure you do it before you set your face
my name is Hank it is time for the
bronzer I'm taking the two-faced unicorn
tears iridescent mystical bronzer looks
like this so it has like a purple
unicorn in the middle Wow okay so let's
just pop this on the cheekbones I'm just
taking a small brush just not sure how
it goes to my skin and of course I'm
gonna put this under my jaw bone as well
the next thing that I'm taking is the
bare minerals Jen nude peachy keen blush
it looks like this it is very dramatic
on my gosh is the lash on there so I'm
gonna keep this very light handed
alright so I'm just gonna put this on
the apples and then blend it back you
know what I'm gonna do actually I'm
gonna go in with this little part here
from the bronzer and use that to
highlight that's a very similar shade to
that stick that we use before it's like
that purple or a decent shade I'm gonna
see what this NARS lip gloss looks like
on its own okay maybe that's a liquid
lipstick I'm not sure I'll leave
everything down below anyway but I'm
just gonna stop playing this I want to
do something subtle on the lips just
because um I want to put lots of glitter
in my face over the top of that I'm just
gonna take these Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick it's just like a lot of
pink I just want to make a bit of an
ombre now it's time for the really fun
pots are taking the in your dreams
glitter beauty balm the lip skin hair
and
oh wow okay so I'm gonna pop this on my
cheekbones so we can apply some glitter
over the top oh this is for a Jewett
glory mmm okay let's just try and Pat
this on then how about it it's really
pretty I'm gonna take the in your dream
sunkissed glow fine glitter mists and
I'm just gonna put this on the back of
my hand and then I'll put it on with my
finger oh my god that's very much I'm
just gonna use the in your dreams
cosmetic glitter this one's in the shade
pink flamingo this is like more chunky
glitter and of course I'm gonna go in it
with some on my inner corner so I'm
gonna take this different shade here
this one's purple unicorn and I'm just
gonna pack that right here oh wow that's
more blue than purple my bad
well I'm here I may as well add some
more glitter
I feel like I just like need a bit more

much glitter
