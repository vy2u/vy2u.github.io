okay so now the time is 10 o'clock and I
just finished setting up my background
and my lighting and everything like that
I'm so now I'm sitting at my makeup desk
and I'm going to do my makeup I haven't
been this excited to film a video in the
longest time like just a normal
chatty kind of here I'm going to be
tasting
American candy again because so many
people have been requesting it so I have
a bag full of stuff right there I'm
going to be sick after that's totally
fine I want to do my makeup now right I
finally finished my makeup I've
literally been doing it for like two
hours because it just was not working
for me
so I'm gonna go through my American
candy video perfect timing because I am
so hungry and then I'm going to eat
something else after it as well so I'll
be right back with your girlfriend
I just finished tasting all that
American candy for a video and really I
honestly do not feel very well at all my
lipsticks still on oh you this is such a
weird color isn't it's like a cement
color oh this is all I got in the
freezer
so I'm gonna have some pizza pockets
these little bad boys are so good so
unhealthy but so good and you know what
I would love to be one of those people
that doesn't find it very hard to eat
healthy that actually kind of enjoys a
taste of healthy food I find it so hard
to eat healthy and I'm not going to sit
here and relax I'm having this for lunch
when really I don't want it I want will
a deep Easter pocket and that's what I'm
going to eat have you guys seen that
girl on Instagram that everyone is
talking about the moment her name's a
Cena or Neil I think she deleted her
account now but she had like five
hundred thousand followers and she
basically was saying that social media
is fake because people like post photos
of things that they don't even use and
they spend so much time trying to get
the perfect photo and dirt kind of black
just enjoy the moment kind of thing and
so many other things that were totally
understandable and I can totally see
where she's coming from but I saw a post
that Kurt Coleman posted the other day
and I want to share it with you because
it honestly is the best thing I've ever
read
when it comes true that situation he was
saying that I know for a fact there is a
lot of thickness on social media
platforms but that's their choice to be
fake with their audience you don't have
to do paid promotions for products you
don't even use I promote products I
actually use and like I don't like to my
audience I wouldn't call my social media
fake because I'm always who I am and I
say to
myself I've embarrassed myself in front
of the whole entire world for being
myself bla bla and he was saying this
massive thing about you can choose to be
fake or not and I honestly just couldn't
agree more so I pretty much just want to
clear this up on my side so I personally
would never ever promote a product that
I wouldn't use and that I don't love I
would never be fake to you guys I am so
open with you guys I tell you everything
I treat you is like you're my best
friend and I would never pretend to be
someone that I'm not as all saying
before I'm not going to go if I can make
a salad because I want to look healthy
and look like I've got my life on track
but really I need a pizza pocket and I'm
happy with it it's not really a big deal
but I just wanted to put that out there
and I was really interesting that what
she was saying and everything you know
when you eat and you get that massive
line of lips is gone because you
basically ate it apparently in a woman's
life you eat estimate of one lipstick
I'm pretty sure I would have eaten at
least 10 lipsticks by now so I just got
changed because I feel like building
another video I guess this is what
happens when I haven't filmed in a while
I just want to film 100 in one day so on
a serious note every we will have been
commenting on my Instagram photos so for
everyone to see and saying I know where
you live I saw you drive into your new
place there it's honestly so
disrespectful and so frustrating how
would you like if I went around telling
people where you lived like this is
probably how I got broken into people
seeing me drive into my house and
telling their friends and then it gets
around to other people like it's so
annoying like you have to let someone
have their privacy once in a while just
because I have followers on Instagram or
YouTube it doesn't make me any different
to you guys I wouldn't go telling people
where you live
so I think I'm gonna film a hole it is
1:30 and I do have a lot of new makeup
to share with you oh yeah I just
finished filming the second video of the
day so it's time to turn all these
darling lights off this light makes my
hair look shiny I just took my makeup
off because I
I was running really intense makeup and
I wasn't wearing up for a walk
bhindi that was so very come on I have
been editing videos all afternoon and
now Jonathan is home help
time to make some jelly bean come here
come say goodnight so we are gonna go to
bed
have a little nap seize now for about 12
hours

disgusting anyways I hope you guys

thumbs up I think it helps me out a lot
