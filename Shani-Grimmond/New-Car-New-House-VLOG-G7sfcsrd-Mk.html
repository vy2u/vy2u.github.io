6 o'clock I've been in a habit of waking
up so early lately and it just feels so
good so I took bindi for a walk
no but I haven't London angels with the
iPad Mini for a walk and then it's a
cold to get some food for today because
I just haven't had food in my fridge for
so long and I'm like I need to get
something because I keep ordering
ubereats which is really bad because all
my money's like see ya see ya yeah but
um then I went to breakfast on myself on
the way home so they caught me brother
cooking all the food that I just bought
but today is an exciting day I'm picking
up my car so I thought I would vlog I

missed it and people always like do
small vlog so yes so what's happening
today

doing with your leg hon what do you put
it oh good uni tore through that you
love the new house don't you you'll
learn a new house I'll show you guys
around the new house today um I need to
clean it first as you can see in the
background a little bit messy so first
let's we might skincare because my face
is so dry right now wow this is my
bathroom
whoa I'm actually moves houses because I
want peace and quiet and at my old place
it was so loud all the time - big wave
delete getting built around me so I miss
here and it's louder has literally put
this every single day at the product and
you playing survivor II five minutes
while officially that's like or whatever
sorry my skincare I'm starting out with
the Bobbi Brown nourishing milk and then
I'm going to go end up with a little
bubbly Brown moisturizer they just sent
me so many of their crafts and I love
the skincare bought it like heaps in the
past third quite privileged to be on it
all the time sorta sick but I have
really dry skin so I have to moisturize
every day twice morning or night so
before I did this um I turned my face
with the Meyer desk
a Ladera try not to see it would collect
extras of my facial last night all the
sweat little bills I creamed of a
horrible body all that sooner and I'm
going to throw my face with some setting

today setting spray it is a facial
fright okay let's do this

because it's all mine
 I'm still going to use of this new
dishwasher cool the literal propeller
just fell off the visual shock see ya
don't repeat that oh now that is how you
like the wood candles all done my
favorite part about the kitchen is I
will plan it how cute so I'm going to
make myself a little bit of oxy shred
it's pretty much just like a protein and
a fat strip in one it makes me have so
much energy so I'm just going to have a
little bit of that you do have to work
out as well if you want to you to such a
fast trick oh it doesn't just like make
you lose weight by itself by itself it's
going to have like half a scoop so I'm
actually very low an eye on that so I
feel like sometimes I need a little bit
of a not natural energy booster so let's
do this okay pretty good I have the
flavor of passion fruit so hey Michael

like first digit my phone bill just
going to do a natural makeup look today
because I don't look cute when I'm
picking up my car
yeah so I'm starting out with a
foundation I'm refusing the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin holy Orange

fake tan on so I can be nice and tan for
the weekend so it's covered each bag but
with my shape tape I honestly whether my

little bit on my cheekbones I want a
really intense glow today like as the
usual at burial and I'm just going to
take the butt of my Beauty Blender and
just blend this up all over my cheeks
it literally adds the most beautiful
glow I've been all about those cream
highlights lightly or liquid highlights
oh my god that is actually amazing so
I'm going to leave all the products that
I'm using right now in the description
below but I'm just going to put even
more highlight over the top just because
I want to be even more pop and you don't
