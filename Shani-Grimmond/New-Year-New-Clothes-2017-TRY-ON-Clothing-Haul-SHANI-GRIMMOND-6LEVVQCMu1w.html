channel so in today's video I'm doing a
a massive clothing haul I honestly have
so many things on the ground right now
that I'm really excited to share with
you keeping your clothes on we have some
bags Sony's lipstick and all that good
stuff so let's go ahead and dive right
in that's the first bunch of clothes and
accessories are from princess Polly so
if you guys are interested in getting
any of these things I'm about to share
with you guys you can get 20% off using
the correct shiny
Polly you can save some money there are
so many things on my go let's do this
let's okay so the first thing that we
have from princess Polly is this choker
right here I am obsessed with it I love
chokers that just shine in the light
when like flash hits it I guess it's
kind of like a mesh choker and it has
like little tiny diamond teeth in each
hole and I just think it looks amazing I
have so many Turkish now and I love it
you guys need to brace yourself for this
next one how large this one has replaced
my little silver charger this is a
massive one and it just looks so good
especially in photos because when the
flash hits all of these crystals it is
just shining so right I think it just
makes any like outfit look so much more
classy and it sounds like really good
quality as well like it's nice and heavy
it doesn't feel cheap a lot of trackers
that I have bought in the past just
enough on me so I'm glad that this is
still in really good condition and I've
been wearing it a lot lately I also grab
these two pairs of Sunny's as well
because I'm obsessed with sunglasses so
these ones are just like the classic
brown and gold frames bunnies they look
like bug eyes exactly what I want and
then we have like a plain black pair of
like kind of herbicides circles honeys I
have crooked ears so I have to like
always bend my knees to suit me I also
managed to pick up these Jeffrey style
liquid lipsticks anytime I see these I
have to get them I adore the formula of
these so princess Polly is the only
store in Australia that does stock
Jeffrey star which is freakin amazing
otherwise you have to get it on his
website with international shipping so
the first color that we have is a Gemini
this is a pinky a warm nude color I
adore this color so much is going to go
with so many
keep it makeup looks and then we have a
Sagittarius which is a light purple it's
nothing over
top or anything it's definitely going to
be easy to wear but it's stealing it out
of the compass box and then last but not
least we have a Leo which is a wall nerd
as well I just do a tutorial using this
and it looked amazing it kind of smells
so like all the joys of style like
lipstick smell kind of odd but um it's
definitely worth it now let's move on to
the clothes so this is my favorite piece
that I got right here so this is a lace
bodysuit my favorite thing about this is
I have these little things that wrap any
what do you call this little fabric
slices that wrap around me arm so it
adds like a bit of a girly flowy look to
it and I just think this is so like
feminine and sexy and everything that
you need thank you and also has
adjustable straps as well which i think
is so handy because I like to bring it
down really fast we have it a cleavage
shown one thing about this so isn't is
see-through around the boob area so you
do have to get electric and fill it full
nipple covers or a black bra anything
like that I also picked up and this top
right here it's just white with black
stripes I wanted to get this to wear
with high-waisted boyfriend jeans I
thought that would look so cool it's
nice and casual and the thing that I
love about it is it's really comfortable
you don't have to wear a strapless bra
and just wear your normal grandma bra
and it still looks awesome the next
thing that I picked up is this long
sleeve top right here so it has a little
cutout at the front and it ties up all
the way so I'm going to have this like
off the shoulder it's going to look
really beachy and boho and I'm going to
have a nice tan with it and I just think
it's going to look so hot by the way I
have a size 8 in everything from
princess Polly and I will leave the
links to everything down below if you
guys are interested but this is going to
look amazing it's definitely different
to what I usually wear but I'm sick of
wearing the same clothes all the time I
always wear basic clothes I'm going to
change it up these jeans are everything
so this is what they look like they call
them mom jeans I'm pretty sure so
they're super high waisted and I'm going
to roll them up around the ankles so
they're kind of like 3/4 I love that
they come up past the belly button for
me because I have a really long torso so
for once
high-waisted jeans are actually high
waisted on me I finally found a really
nice pair of overalls so I've been
looking for like literally two months
because I really want to wear a pair of
overalls to a festival I just think it
looks
and it's so different so what I'm going
to do is wear like a really fancy bra
lit under it and I'm going to have only
one of these done up and then one leg
slopping earth pin and then I'm going to
roll the pants up because they are kind
of long as you can see right here and so
cool you guys just wait I also picked up
this t-shirt right here this brand I'm
pretty sure of like a skater brand so I
think it's going to go perfectly would
be a mom jeans down the other really
high-waisted ones it's just going to
look really chill and like scanner II
kind of way but anything would like this
really soft material is amazing because
I always lean towards the like really
comfy clothes over the really dressy
clothes that uncomfortable so these are
the things that I actually wear like an
everyday basis instead of like dresses
or you know skirt next we have these are
really cool shoes which some people
absolutely hate but I'm obsessed to them
and I finally got them so they have the
clear straps and the see-through heel
which how low that is awesome and then
it has the nude base so the brand is
windsor-smith I love that brand that
always like really good quality shoes
I'm hoping that something like
completely cut the circulation on my
feet from this plastic but other size 10
I cannot believe that I always try to
fit in a size 8 in like squeeze middle
toes net because like I don't want to be
a big foot for the rest of my life the
last thing that I have from princess
Polly are these and rose gold hoops I do
have a pair of really cheap hoops but
they were hurting my ear and getting
really rusty because they were really
cheap so I'm just going to swap them out
for these ones because this one's
obviously I'm going to rusty because
they're a little bit more expensive but
if you guys have been watching my last
few videos you would know that I've been
obsessed with tube slightly that is so
classy and I'm glad that they've came
back in session because I just jump on
that bandwagon like you wouldn't believe
and I'm not off it yet I'm sorry next up
we have this black dress is a long one
pass to knees and it grows off the
shoulder this one is from Koo Chi so if
you guys know of qu Chi you would know
that it's usually really overpriced when
it comes to the dresses I'm traditional
this one was like 130 but I went to a
discounter one Android's $30 first
roaster $30 that is amazing
so you know what's in all Khmer zhing
with it well I guess this pretty much
just looks amazing with everything but
I'm super excited word is because just
like that perfect like sexy black dress
little black dress you know means next
up we have this a really cute jumpsuit I
absolutely love the color of this I
definitely don't have anything like it
and I love that it has a little I don't
know what of a little sloppy pass on the
arm it just adds so much like going this
to the look and it kind of covers my
flabby arms because I haven't been to
gym in a while so I like the material on
it as well it's not like the Plain Jane
kind of thing that I usually go for so
I'm really happy with this pick so when
I was in LA not little girl I picked up
this corset looking thing that grows on
the outside of your clothes probably
thinking what the hell is that but I
can't find a dress to wear it with so I
think if you weigh like a flowy dress
and then you put this around your waist
it like tightens that area and it looks
so good so I'm still waiting for the day
that I can wear this but it is like a
sway like fluffy material with the gold
chain it's sort of classy
I have nothing away with it so I always
buy stuff and like no muses the next
thing that I have is this a black crop
right here this one is from a chic I
love chic because it's like really
mature but it's still really sexy it has
really good things for like special
occasions but I have been to find
another Spacek so this one goes across
the shoulders and it is pretty sure it's
all girls like just under the belly
button and I think it is absolutely
amazing I love this when I saw it I was
like I have to get it I tried it on like
four times and I'm like oh my god I
can't get it can someone help me and
they're like okay this is how you do
what you need to fold this down and then
step into it and I was like whoa I had
it on my back to front like while I was
in chic I happen to find something else
I'm always having goodies in there so
this one is like a bone orange crop it
goes around the neck like this which I
mean kind of out of fashion but look at
me I'm wearing it all the time I don't
even care so it has about the front as
well this looks amazing with the high
waisted pants from there just for my
last video you will assume or my last
fall you would have seen there is white
hoursa pants from chic amazing amazing
would you look at that another crop from
Koo Chi so I actually grabbed two of
these but I can't seem to find the other
one it also got like a boring color but
this is the pink one it's just like a
little crop that goes amazingly with a
pencil skirt just for clubbing it's
super comfortable and stretchy and
stretchy and it's just like a basic that
everyone should have I actually just
picked this up like two days ago I was
obsessed
that as soon as I saw it I just love
like the flower patent on their distinct
it's really gully and I love the mesh it
is sort of see-through so you do have to
wear our black browser that's I mean if
you want you can be nipples out if you
want sup your choice and another things
I love about it is the sleeve the next
shop that I stopped into was pop shop
this is just another basically attire
it's just a black one but it is a little
bit flowy around the rib area ourselves
okay this is a little bit of a different
shape to all the other black tops I have
I'm gonna grab this one in flow I really
like the material obviously well it's
super soft and you know as I took a
floor I live for comfy clothes let's
move on to the next jumpsuit that we
have right here I love this because it
is blush tone and it also is off the
shoulders against to the girly right up
my alley it is cinched around the waist
and it actually fits me because
sometimes what some doctors don't suit
me because I do have a long torso but
did fit perfectly
you know why probably because it has the
adjustable straps the last clothing
piece that we have right here is another
jumpsuit so I feel like some people
weren't like this because it kind of
looks like a tablecloth by kind of
really dig it again off the shoulders
obviously that's in is you know a lot of
material right here for listen to what
is that but this one is finished around
the waist as well I guess
this whole thing is in so it's pretty
much every shops I just get everything I
see think you think you'll have that
I'll have that this is really comfy as
well I think that's why I like them so
much I'm saving the best thing for last
this is a why I sell clutch as a gift
from it's just as the label for a
Christmas present and I was honestly so
shocked I can't believe I got this it's
so pretty I'd be wearing it so much it
has a gold chain with a little black
thing up here so it's like not calling a
shoulder you know they're thinking of
you they're always thinking of you but I
think this is like the perfect staple
black bag for any special occasion jokes
everywhere clubbing I've been wearing at
me chilly everywhere let's finish this
video with a bang the last thing that I
have cute this is a Louis Vuitton Clark
it is like that shiny black material
every time it's a shiny
it sounds like shiny it's really weird
and someone commented on my video when I
said something was shiny they're like
it's shiny know what I was the only one
that thought that but
the buckle comes down like this and it's
just so classy and luxurious I'm living
to this actually haven't won it yet
because I find that like the strap one's
easier because you don't actually have
to like hold it but Jonathan got me this
and I'm so grateful it's very pretty and
classy I love it all right my chicken
wings I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give it a big thumbs
up and subscribe to my channel if you

holes make sure to let me know I can do
