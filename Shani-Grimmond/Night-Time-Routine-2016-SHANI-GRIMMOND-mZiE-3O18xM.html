so I thought I would show you what I get
up to in the afternoon all the way
through to night time so first thing
that I like to do is light some candles
I am a sucker for candles they smell
amazing and having a dog doesn't leave
your house smelling that great so around
this time it's about 4 o'clock 4:30 and
I like to finish up my editing for the
day just so when Jonathan gets home I
don't have to do any work so it depends
if I have a video going up the next day
I'll be editing otherwise I'd be
watching YouTube videos getting inspired
or watching Netflix anything like that
the only time I ever get motivation is
just before someone comes over or if
Jonathan comes home so 10 minutes before
he's home I like to quickly get up do
some washing do dishes anything like
that but I mean this is only some days
not all the time but I don't know why I
just don't have motivation to clean if
I'm alone I mean why who's gonna see
them it's only me and it's my mess so
who cares now that the house is tidy
it's time to pull out something for
dinner usually I don't have too much in
my fridge at all because I like to go
shopping the day of just so the food is
nice and fresh so today we're having
chicken pasta and vegetables so Jonathan
literally gets home at the exact same
time every single day he walks out of
that worked or 5 o'clock and gets her
5/2 and any time anyone walks in the
door bindi goes absolutely crazy except
for my brother she doesn't really like
enjoy his company too much at all
now time to cook the dinner sometimes I
helped her ankle sometimes that hurt
today I did because the dish was super
easy so starting off by cutting some
Tomatoes and he's like you need to stop
you're gonna cut your fingers off he
always makes fun of me when I'm cooking
because I kind of suck really bad so we
swap jobs
usually by this time I'm super hangry I
don't know why but we always leave
cooking to the very last minute but now
dinner is ready it is time to dig in and
oh my gosh it was so delicious I don't
know why but bindi always does her
little well I'm guessing it's because
she wants some food but she doesn't
really like to eat her dog food so every
time we're eating her now for my
favorite part of the day it is time to
freshen up wash my hair Oh God my hair
is so long it just gets in the way of
everything
now of course it's time to get some
really comfortable pajamas I don't have
time to look cute for bed I always just
want to be comfy just wear an oversized
top and I'm good to go usually I wash my
face when I'm in the shower but
obviously I can't really show you that
so I thought I'd show you after my
shower so usually what I use is my
origins never a dull moment face
cleanser it is super thick and it has
like little exfoliating beads in it as
well so it's really nice it keeps my
face super hydrated I've been traveling
quite a bit so my face has been kind of
dry so that's why I thought I would use
this one I do have a few other cleansers
that I use for more of like a deep
cleanse and more of an exfoliant as well
and then it is time to brush all that
fur off my teeth so the toothbrush that
I'm using today is the advanced sonic
toothbrush this one is from a vanity
planet and I absolutely adore it
I've been using it for a few months now
and it just makes my teeth feel so
incredibly clean especially compared to
the handheld toothbrushes oh I love it
I actually talked from the financially
getting this toothbrush it's on its way
I would have to say my favorite thing
about this toothbrush is the fact that
it has a two minute timer so when I
brush my teeth like a handheld
toothbrush or something I feel like I
don't do it as long because obviously
I'm not time yet and I don't know how
long I was supposed to be doing it for
so that is super helpful and I think
another really good thing about it is
that it has a senate izing charging base
that removes 99% of germs and bacteria
which honey that is great because you're
putting it in your mouth and it also has
like a little tongue cleaner on the back
of it so make sure you scrub it avid
herb or all that bad breath off so if
you guys are interested in this
toothbrush I will leave a 75% discount
code in the description below along with
all the other information that you may
need I would say about once a week I
apply a face mask I have so many in my
cupboard that this was actually the
first time using this one here and so
far so good it's like a really runny
consistency it's really smooth to put on
the skin and it dries in literally five
minutes it made my skin feel super clean
and I just love the feeling of a fresh
face of a bed
last step is to moisturize my skin again
this one is a new one first time using
it I really really liked it it was
extremely hydrating so I get a few
things sent to me to my Piero bucks I
always just like to try out new things
so far so good
now it's time to lightly brush up my
hair when my hair is wet it snaps a
little bit easier so I'm making sure to
be really careful now I'm going in with
some treatment and just focusing this on
the ends of my hair just because I've
been dyeing it a little bit lately I
want to make sure to keep it nice and
hydrated because it is feeling a little
bit dry this is so random but I just
wanted to show you my little watch and
perfume collection I just think it looks
so cute
so now it's time to just relax and do
whatever we feel like doing tonight we
played Monopoly I love it so much
other times we watch Netflix or YouTube
videos or you know just hang out and do
our thing can I just say that I have the
best dog ever look how cute she is Sidhe
complain lap she's always just following
me around I love it so much
so my attention span is quite short
sometimes they don't really get through
a whole game hey bindi how you doing
now it's time to blow out my candles and
head to bed and wind down a little bit
it doesn't really look like I'm one down
I'm always on social media always
watching YouTube's right that's why I'm
doing it so much in this video because
literally that's what I do I was having
a hard time getting comfortable here as
you can see but recently I've just been
going to bed really late and I don't
know you can tell like how much energy I
have late at night I don't know what is
wrong with me I wasn't so used to it oh
my god but yeah there we have my
nighttime routine I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you want to see more
videos like this please give this one a
big thumbs up I love you guys so so much
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
