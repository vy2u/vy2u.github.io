my channel so let's go ahead and jump
straight into the makeup look I'm just
going to start with a medium brown shade
and this is going directly in my crease
just to add a bit more dimension and so
the other colors can blend up into this
one so I'm just taking a really round
fluffy brush and working it in now going
in with my huda beauty palette this is
amazing I'm just going to take a all of
the green kind of color and I'm just
using this to dig up the crease even
more add some dimension and get it
really dark and smoky so I'm just using
a smaller blending brush and just taking
it from side to side making sure there's
no harsh lines at all and to ensure that
I went back in with the medium brown
just to blend out any edges and then
picking up that black shade from the
huda beauty palette this is going
directly in my crease with an even
smaller blending brush so I'm just
taking that from outer corner and then
making it a little bit later on the
inner corner so this is just going to
really smoke it out once I have it place
all of that down I'm going to go back in
with that brown shade and blend out any
edges because we want it to be nervous
smokey now going in with this Oliver
green shadow I'm just going to apply
this all over my lid with my finger
these are applied best with the finger
so it's kind of hard if you do have
nails but I'm trying my best and then
with whatever like areas that I've left
I'm just going to take a small synthetic
brush and just pack that down as much as
I can this is such a pretty shade now
moving on to the base I'm taking this
primer from at Becca it is the back
light priming filter it is absolutely
stunning if you want a really nice glow
to the face then for foundation I'm
taking this one from Milani it was a few
shades too light but we're going to work
with it and put some bronzer on later so
I'm just going to start by painting this
all over my face with a paddle brush and
then I just went in with a Beauty
Blender to make sure there's no like
lines from the brush or anything and to
make sure it is super full coverage
now it's time to cancel out the
discoloration under my eyes so I'm
taking this one from NYX I only had a
tiny bit of this left so I was just
working with what I had but I do really
like this concealer especially for the
prize it just does a great job at
covering everything up so to set that
down I'm going in with the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder as soon as
I've done that concealer I'm just going
to pack it right on so we have no
creasing at all and then to set the rest
of the face and going in with this one
primer Australis it is a few shades
darker than my face so that's exactly
what I want because the foundation was a
little bit light so we're just going to
match it to the neck and now I'm super
matte which kind of takes away the
purpose of that primer but I love this
powder okay so let's now move on to the
lower lash line I'm just taking this a
violet boss glitter glue and just lining
that from outer corner to inner corner
so this Mac gold glue sticks and oh my
god this is a previous gold glitter I've
ever seen you guys need to get it I'm
just going to pack that a right over the
top and it looks so stunning now it's
time to pull the whole look together
with it so I'm at massive lashes so I'm
going to start by taking this essence
mascara and just coating my top and
bottom lashes to prep them for falsies
and then for the falsies I just
literally found the most dramatic ones
in my cupboard and just stuck them right
on and it just made everything look
stunning and then for the inner corner
I'm taking a violet Voss glitter blue
and just plopping that on and then
following up with the artist Couture
diamond glow powder in the shade at
gold-digger and just putting that
directly on top to add a bit of a glow
to the inner corners and then to contour
I'm taking the bomb at Bahama Mama
bronzer and just carving out my cheeks
that making them look super defined
now it's time to warm up the face a bit
so I'm taking this a macit mineralized
skinfinish in the share that give me Sun
I use this all the time I'm sure you
guys have seen me use it before but it's
like a really nice bronzy orangey color
and it just complements the face so well
and makes it look like you have a really
nice tan so I'm just putting this under
my cheekbones where I contoured and also
around the perimeter of my face to just
give everything life and then of course
I'm going in and baking underneath my
bronzer just because it did get a bit
messy under there so I'm just making
sure it is
super sharp looking this honestly makes
the whole look looks so much cleaner now
it's time for blush I'm taking this one
from Mac it's just like a blush it
honestly matches every single makeup
look it's in the shade Melba love it so
I'm just popping this on the apples of
my cheeks and blending it back just for
a little bit of color now it is time for
highlighter so I'm going back in with
that same inner corner highlight from
artists couture and I'm just springg my
brush with some mac fix+ and then I'm
just gonna pop it on my cheekbones to
add a bit of a glow and then we can move
on to the lips so I'm taking this liquid
lipstick by huda beauty I absolutely
adore the formula of these liquid
lipsticks it's just so easy to apply and
so comfortable to wear so this is going
all over the lips and then on the center
I'm taking this one from Jeffrey star as
per usual in the shade I'm nude I just
like to create a bit of an ombre lip
effect and also I like really nude lips
so this is perfect and of course we're
going to go ahead blend it out make it
look nice and smooth and blended with no
harsh lines then I'm just going to set
my face with this dried cosmetics
setting spray making sure my makeup
doesn't move throughout the whole entire
day and then I'm going to finish off
with even more highlighter because I
feel like it wasn't as intense as that
hope so I'm going in with this one from
Physicians Formula it is so stunning I'm
just going to pack this directly over
the top and it's going to be super
pigmented as well because I just put
that setting spray on so it's really
going to stick onto it so yeah I really
hope you guys like this look I'm
obsessed with how it turned out because
it's something like a little bit
different but it still is really easy to
wear so I hope you guys enjoyed it make
sure you give this video a big thumbs up
love you and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
