today's video is going to be a one brand
makeup tutorial on benefit benefit is
definitely one of my favorite brands
ever so I am so excited to be doing this
video today there will be like three or
four products that aren't benefit early
because they don't sell like fake
eyelashes will not that I know of
so yeah I'll just be tracking a few
other brands in here but hopefully you
guys don't mind and I'll also be talking
about the giveaway that I'm doing I'm at
the end of this video so if you want to
win this big bag of benefit goodies then
stay tuned to the end and I'll talk
about the rules and everything like that
so yeah let's jump into it okay so
before I apply my foundation I always
apply moisturizer just so the foundation
goes on nice and smooth and stuff so
today I'll be using the total moisture
facial cream let's see how this goes
it definitely feels quite thick and
moisturizing which is what I want in my
moisturizer because I do have quite dry
skin I like the feeling of this it's
really nourishing on my skin to prime my
skin I'll be taking the benefit
Porefessional this is my second two of
this stuff now I really like the feeling
of it like our favorite plan it's like
really soft and it kind of feels like
the baby's bottom I guess I don't know
I'm just going to start by working
within the center of my face and then
blending it outwards because that's
where most of my pores are essential now
it's time to match my face to my neck so
I'll be taking the hello flawless oxygen
Wow foundation in the shade toasted
beige and I'll be applying it with a
flat top kabuki brush by Sigma oh my god
this matches so well to my fake tan I
don't think it would match very well if
I didn't have a really dark fake tan on
though I would love if you guys would
let me know in the comments below what
your favorite fake tan is because I'm
like a fake tan junkie and I love trying
new ones out so don't be shy
girlfriend I also really like the finish
that it leaves like it's a little bit of
a joy finish but it's not overpowering
it just looks really healthy and radiant
which is definitely my favorite
financial foundations for concealer I'll
be taking my favorite one which is the
maybelline instant age rewind in the
shade light pale I don't have a benefit
one so this is just going to have to do
for now umm let's do this girlfriend I
like to use this to highlight under my
eyes as you can see it's like so so
white well not white but pale
I'm just going to blend this in with my
finger I usually use my Beauty Blender
but for some reason I just can't find it
anywhere I just I can't do I need it in
my life do you set everything in place
I'm taking the Porefessional Agent Zero
shine this is interesting
I've never tried this in my life so open
time to bronze up the skin of it I'm
taking the whole lot by benefit
obviously bronzer and I have hit pan
with this I've had it for so long I'm
just going to be taking this on a small
fo5 face Sigma just under my cheekbones
just to define that a little bit and
I'll just take it up onto my temples so
it's not laughs and just a line
it'll just blend together nicely and
also just down these sides my nose
slightly and under the lip to make it
look bigger alright first of all I'll be
applying the Sunbeam popping that on
this is just like more of a gold
highlighter which is nice because I do
not have one of these just going to be
blending that out with my highlighter
brush by Sigma oh that's pretty it's
very subtle look it's not over-the-top
it's just like a nice glow and now I'll
be taking the what's up popping that
right on the top this is more of a
champagne kind of highlighter and for
blush I'll be taking the rocket off
which smells really really good
umm and I'm taking that on a Coastal
Scents angular brush which is my
favorite for blush and now to define my
crease I'm taking the hoola bronzer
again and just popping that in my crease
and I'm also going to be taking this on
my lower lash line as well and I should
really be using a smaller brush but it's
like a meter away from me and I can't be
bothered okay so now I'm going to do my
eyebrows and then go back to my eyes so
I'm taking the brow Zing's little pallet
for eyebrows this is honestly it's so
amazing I'll use it like three times now
and I cannot get enough of it so the
first thing I'll be doing is taking the
wax and just
bring this in my eyebrows and I don't
know why I do the wax first this is just
what I like personally but I'm pretty
sure you put this on after I have no
idea so I'll just be using this little
brush that comes with it for some reason
I freaking love this brush which usually
I never like the brushes that come with
the product so I'm just going to start
from the tail of my brow and just extend
it a little bit and I'm just going to be
over drawing them a tiny bit I think I
have found a new Holy Grail eye brow
product yay and now to highlight under
the brow bone I'm taking the high brow
glow and I'm just going to be popping
this right underneath for my eyes I'm
taking V a big beautiful eyes and
contour kit I'll be taking this like a
light kind of pink shade it reminds me a
lot of a shade from the Naked 3 over
decay palette so I'm just going to be
packing this all over my lid
time for some eyeliner I'm taking the
they're real push-up liner I am a sore
about of applying eyeliner so let's see
how this goes
okay so if you suck at applying your
eyeliner like I do then you can just go
ahead and hide it with really big lashes
so I'll be taking the benefit they're
real mascara this stuff is amazing it's
my second tube now so I'm just going to
be putting this all over my lashes I'm
trying so hard not to make that ugly
mascara face like mmm and now I'm going
to be popping so I'm at four one five at
red cherry lashes on these are so pretty
especially when you have really big win
wind wind liner it looks super super
good the last thing we're doing is
moving on to lips and the early lip
product I have is this ultra plush hoola
like lip gloss and I feel like it's not
enough to make a look complete so I'll
also be going in with the Mac strip-down
lip liner and the YSL lipstick in this
shade survive Rouge pur Couture
so that we have it in the finished look
I really hope you guys liked it it was
really fun just like playing around with
different products I'm seeing how
everything went the one thing they don't
have to 100% recommend is the browsing
palette on my god that was so good I
just love the way my eyebrows turned out
today um and yeah before I talk about
the giveaway and all the rules and
everything I just want to say to anyone
