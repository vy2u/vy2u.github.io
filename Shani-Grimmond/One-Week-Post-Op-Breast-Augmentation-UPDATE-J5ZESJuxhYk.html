channel start in today's video I'm going
to be talking all about my boob job
one week post-op sir I have a lot of
things to talk about I actually got my
surgery done 12 days ago so I'm a little
bit late but um I'll get into why I
didn't film it exactly a week later very
soon so basically I stayed in Sydney for
five days after I got my surgery and
then I came on home so for those five
days I was literally bedridden I didn't
want to move at all I was supposed to
like do the exercises like lifting your
arms up and stuff and doing the little
twelve but I was in like so much pain it
wasn't like unbearable but like because
I was in pain I was like honestly I'm
not gonna put myself through more pain
and like do these fucking exercises that
I'm supposed to do which I should have
done but um when I did go to the physio
to get like the fluids massage because I
I was really swollen once she did that
it felt like a lot better each time so
yeah when I was in Sydney it was fine I
was just pretty much one painkillers for
five days straight sleeping a lot
watching a lot of Netflix I was probably
fine because I had Michael's helping
everything so literally the day after I
like a few days after getting the
surgery my painkillers weren't really
working because my body was so immune to
all of these painkillers I got my wisdom
teeth taken out week before so when I
was taking these painkillers for my
boobs
I still feel a lot of pain and a lot of
people had told me Oh like it's fine
when you come out because you can't feel
anything you're on so many painkillers
like blah blah and so I was like why am
I still in like quite a bit of pain like
this is really weird considering what
everyone said so I messaged my doctor
and I was like um link and why is this
hurting so much is it supposed to be
like this is normal like it's definitely
bearable but I'm just like everyone else
says it doesn't hurt like so like what's
going on and he said well because I was
on like painkillers a week before my
buddies probably like immune to it sir I
double my dose and then I was completely
out of it for the time I was in Sydney
and then when I got home on this Sunday
I stopped taking all the painkillers and
antibiotics by then because that's I
think that's when you're supposed to
stop and I kind of just like was dealing
with the pain because it was like it was
fine and then five days onwards for the
fifth sixth and seventh day without like
panel or anything I just felt like
puddle wasn't really gonna do anything
so I didn't even bother taking it so I
pretty much just like stayed in bed for
those three days it did not move at all
like literally I was just like this is
like really uncomfortable like it it
wasn't like to the point where I was
like I need help like this is fucked it
was like I'm just gonna stay as still as
I can so I can't feel any pain because
it was when I lifted my arms up like
this when I felt pain and like if I
would just sit still it was fun and it
was like it was like nothing ever had
happened sorry that's what I was doing
the occasional like shoulder blade
movements that you're supposed to do and
stuff sir
fast food on true now twelve days later
I'm feeling so much better than I was
three days ago
honestly three days ago I was in bed
couldn't do anything couldn't lift
anything couldn't even wet Marron ass to
be honest with you I couldn't even go
shopping because I couldn't pick up
black shopping bags and stuff so if you
are getting a boob job make sure you
have someone to look after you for at
least at least ten days I would say or
at least get someone to do your shopping
for you because I was getting new breats
every day because that was the only bag
that I could carry the three kilo bag
walking down my apartment block sir I
can't sleep on my stomach for one year
which is like the one thing that's
really killing me I have been sleeping
on my back like flat after seven days
because that's what I read that you can
do I also read that you're supposed to
sleep elevated for two weeks but then I
just decided to go with the fact that
one of the sheets that I got said I
could light and after awake I was like
well if one staying awake one saying two
weeks I'm fucking laying down that's for
sure
I needed a good night's sleep because I
was in bed like 24/7 anyway I'm just
gonna sit up the whole time less yeah
I've heard that some people recover
literally so quickly like I was getting
messages saying I was fine the next day
literally I felt like nothing had
happened
and then I've got told like a few weeks
later like I could hardly move my arms
I've heard three weeks later like I was
in so much pain still so I think for me
I'm pretty
lucky I definitely feel like like I feel
like my boob size is like perfect like
I'm sorry happy with the boob size but
like I definitely feel like the plastic
is not meant to be in there like when
I'm going over bumps and stuff in cars
I'm like oh my god I can feel the
silicon in my breasts and like it feels
like it's not supposed to be in there
like it's still obvious like it's only
been 12 days so like I'm not used to I'm
not used to the feeling or anything but
it just feels very foreign and I'm just
like yeah what's going on for you guys
that don't know I did get 375 s and I
originally wanted my boobs really small
but the whole reason why I got a boob
job is because when I went off the pill
my boobs shrunk so much and there was so
much skin that needs to be filled so I
needed an implant that was really gonna
fill out all of that skin so there was
no Sagat also to get no sag I had to go
with 375 and I'm so happy with the size
of them because I have really big
shoulders so it really proportions out
this area and stuff and I'm really happy
about that like my mom has a big
shoulders that's where I got it thanks
mom and she got like massive boobs black
she reckons that Doubledays in I'm like
huh it's not a TT that's like an actual
soccer ball on each breast so training
yeah
broad shoulders run the family that's
why I feel like these big old boobs look
small on me because of how broad this
area is to me I think my boobs are like
perfectly in proportion I'm so happy I'm
so now let's talk about the driving so I
was driving like 7 or 3 days after my
surgery and it was kind of really hot I
was like toning like this on my clothes
shit I shouldn't be driving but
yesterday today it's been fine so like
ten eleven days later I'm feeling a lot
better I feel like I can do more like
more things that I would do on a day to
day basis you're picking up something
too heavy you know they are not supposed
to because these muscles like to start
to ache like shit already look I'm
wearing a compression bra and I've gotta
weigh this one for three months as far
as I'm concerned I haven't gone for my
one week post-op yet I'm doing that in
three days so then I don't know like
more about like the aftercare of leg
this stuff but my scars underneath my
boobs are so small I still have the tape
over most scars right now I was supposed
to take them off today but I'm just
gonna leave it until I go see my surgeon
because a week after I got my like the
boob job my scars were kind of like
stinging and like one of them was like
really stinging and I looked at it and
there was like dry blood there and I'm
like I don't know if that's normal I
obviously it's not like it was just cut
open and stitched up but I'm a little
bit paranoid about that so I'm just
gonna let him take it off
because come back you know if I opened
it and then like my implant fell out
it's not gonna happen but like--imagine
let's have a look at my breasts tickles
even though they covered up so um
they're in the surgical bra right now so
they're all push back but they feel very
very hard like they're literally like
rocks this boob is so much more swollen
than this one right here like honestly
this one looks at least three sizes
bigger than this one like when I was
taking a photo of and today I'm like wow
I'm gonna have to cover one boob with
some hair because this one looks so much
bigger when I go to see my surgeon
obviously he's probably just gonna say
like it's normal like that's the whole
process of healing itself it's only been
12 days so I'm trying not to stress out
about that but this one kind of like the
breast starts here and then this one and
kind of starts here but this one is
dropping quicker and this boob
originally was bigger so yeah it's gonna
be fine so about a week later for me my
concerns I mean not concerns but where
my pain is coming from is this this base
that's Holt it but this nipple stings
really bad and it's really uncomfortable
and I try and like take the compression
bra off it to see if it goes away but
it's it's not that it's not that it's
not the pressure I don't know what it is
my nipple is just like stinging all the
time
another thing is my side like not even
my side boob here but like literally
like my ribcage back here I think it's
like full of fluid or something I don't
know it feels like it's bruised it's
really really sore like that's probably
the most saw part on me which is weird
cuz it's not even my boo but obviously
it's
can I could somehow so I took my nipple
covers off five days after and I was
like oh my gosh of my nipples I've
stretch I ain't gonna be happy I'm not
but they did stretch a tiny bit but now
they're like imperfect like proportion
with my breast size obviously because
that big I know that their nipples big
oh it's fun looks great honestly it
looks like I'm sorry I can't drink two
weeks after my surgery that's what I
read on the like off to cash sheet but I
also read online that you can drink
after you stop you antibiotics and I
stopped that like lost like a few days
ago so all my friends are going out I
literally went to the priest though
right sitting in my pajamas knows like
hey getting lit tonight and I'm sitting
in my bed I have fun guys know honestly
I don't even miss going out anymore I'm
just like whatever like have fun I do
that I used to do that every weekend
like I've ever read anyway sir that's
fine but yeah I just didn't want to go
out and drink anyway just because the
swelling is so bad just want to squeeze
them story hot mic on oh my god this
video is going to get demonetized
so I will update you guys on how
everything goes off to my one week
post-op appointments so I'll do like a
two week post-op or a month or whatever

has changed I'll update you guys sir I
