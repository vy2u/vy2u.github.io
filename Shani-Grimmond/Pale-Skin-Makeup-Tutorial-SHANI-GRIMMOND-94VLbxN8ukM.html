my channel so I'm doing a pale skin and
makeup tutorial today I hope you like it
and let's go ahead and jump straight
into it so as per usual I'm going to
start off with priming my eyes with my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot this is a
beautiful color match to my non fake ten
skin it covers up all the veins and
stuff and also makes the eyeshadow go on
a lot more pigmented so just setting
that with a powder and moving on
streaked with eyeshadow I'm using my
tartlet in bloom eyes shadow palette
today and just picking up this nice
pinky shade and I'm going to use this as
a transition shade so taking it in my
crease from inner to outer corner and
make it nice and blown out after I keep
packing it on I'll take a fluffy brush
and blend blend blend until it's nice
and seamless now taking a old warm brown
shade I'm going to put this in the
crease as well but I'm not going to take
it as high as I took the transition
shade so just to add some nice warmth
and depth to the look
and now I'm going to take this beautiful
champagne shimmery shade and I'm going
to spray some fix+
on my brush to make sure it's super wet
and pigmented and well was that
pigmented so just putting this all over
my lid and it just makes the eyes stand
out so incredibly much next thing I'm
doing is taking this nice deep dark
brown plummy kind of shade and I'm just
going to pack this on the outer third of
my eye just to make it more smoky and of
course cleaning up that eye shadow with
a q-tip when I have pale skin I always
like to make my foundation look super
Joey Jess way look healthy and glowy
because I feel like when I'm pale I look
a bit dead so this is a must for me this
is my Laura Mercier radiance primer and
I love it so much for foundation I'm
taking the Australis o glow and a little
bit of most Charlotte Tilbury foundation
I wanted a shade darker than my neck
just so I could bring it down a little
bit to add a tiny bit of color because
girl this is a really big difference to
when I have fake tan on just a quick
little disclaimer I personally use fake
tan because it makes me feel more
confident I fake tan once a week and
this is the palest I've been in quite
some time so I thought I may as well
film while I was pale but I have nothing
against pale skin I think it looks
beautiful I just personally feel more
confident with tan skin time for
concealer I'm taking my la girl pro
conceal in the shade at porcelain when
I'm really fair I do notice my circles
are a bit more noticeable because
there's no Tanner of the top of them or
anything like that so this is a
beautiful shade to keep them nice and
highlighted and just looking very fresh
so just blending that out with a Beauty
Butler Beauty Blender as per usual I
need to get more I have like I think
I've got one I just I just lose small
it's like they go rolling off my balcony
or something I have no idea
now taking my Australis banana powder
I'm using this to set all of my
concealer I'm only setting under my eyes
and down the center of my face just
because I want the rest of the skin to
be glory so I didn't set that at all but
this powder is really good especially to
keep things nice and highlighted again
taking my transition shade I'm going to
put this on my lower lash line from
inner corner to outer corner just make
it nice and blown out so we can
proportion the top lid to the lower lash
line and then taking the warm brown and
just focusing that on at the outer third
now highlighting my waterline with my
tied in a rim lineup somehow I managed
to poke my eyebrow I don't know how that
happened but this makes my eyes look a
little bit bigger and this is so
pigmented it's definitely the best cream
colored eyeliner I have ever used
now taking that shimmery shade once
again I'm just gonna highlight under my
eyebrow and a girl this was pigmented
again Wow oops so making sure to blend
out that highlighter so it blends in
with the eyeshadow and it's not too
harsh next thing I'm doing is taking the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade
Sahara this is even more intense than
the other one I just use so I wanted
something a bit more highlighting so
this is perfect next thing I'm doing is
taking my essence eyebrows styler set
and just filling in my brows as per
usual I like to make my art if it bigger
make my tail a bit longer and just to
find them a bit more
now it's time for mascara so this one is
the physicians for mark
Wow Physicians Formula Organic wear
mascara so just creating my top and
bottom lashes with this to prep them for
some falsies and then it's time to
contour I had to find the lightest
contouring it shade in my collection and
I finally found one and this was a great
match so this is the next contour
palette so we're just putting this under
my cheekbones and then I'm going in with
some bronzer so to see betty lou manizer
by the balm I'm just using a very very
light hand with this because it is
extremely pigmented and probably a
little bit too dark for my skin but I
mean I always want that JLo glow no
matter what skin color I have and then
take my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm just going to bake
under my contour to make sure the line
is super neat and should make it look
even more dramatic without adding any
more contour now it's time to add these
beautiful lashes these are the huge oh I
always stuffed up huda beauty lashes
that's such a tongue twister these ones
have a very thick band so they're not as
comfortable as like the thin wired bands
but they do look a hundred times better
because they're dramatic and these ones
I'm pretty sure like double layered so
they're just super incredible now taking
it some at Physicians Formula blush I
think adding blush kind of pulls the
whole look together just because my skin
is so fair it's just adding some color
and life back into my skin so this one
is shimmery I like to keep the whole
face shimmery because I want to look
glowy so just wiping that bitch off and
then it's time to add some highlighter
so this is the Laura Mercier highlighter
I'll leave the name of it down below I'm
not too sure what it's called I'm pretty
sure it's new though and oh I was really
happy about this highlighter it looks so
stunning
I also sprayed some mac fix+ my brush as
well to make it even more intense so
just putting it on my cheekbones and
also on my forehead down the center of
my nose
on my Cupid's bow I went a little
overboard and that's that's the spirit
now taking my NYX retractable lip liner
in the shade at Coco you know just doing
my thing outlining my lips
and then taking my aura long-lasting
like a lipstick in the shade on a Lulu
I'm just filling in my lips with this
stuff it is very quite dry compared to
the normal liquid lipsticks but it's
also really comfortable on the lips it
doesn't like grow crusty or anything so
I really like the formula of this stuff
and it also lasts a really long time
which is amazing so lastly I'm going to
put some lip gloss on it this is the
balm lip gloss
I just like having glossy lips for some
reason I'm just going through a phase I
think so there we have the finished
makeup look I hope you guys loved it and
I hope you learned a few things here and
there and I'll be doing a bronzy makeup
tutorial very soon as well so keep your
eye out
put that and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
