channel sorry
in today's video festival I have a
little party towel I still can't believe
I cut my hair off and that has resulted
to me getting a clip in extension party
towel so I'm really happy about that
actually I've had a little stir okay I'm
gonna try not to touch my hair because
that is so annoying when I watch people
and they're like no sorry in today's
video I'm teaming up with princess Polly
and MAC Cosmetics which I'm so excited
about because one I love clothes and too
I love makeup so that's like joined into
one video I mean like can't get any
better than that sir princess Polly and
MAC Cosmetics are doing a massive
massive competition for you guys they're
giving away the ultimate like a wardrobe
and makeup pack so it's worth two
thousand dollars and it's so easy to
enter I will leave the link right here
so basically it's a thousand dollars
worth of clothes from princess Polly and
$1,000 worth of mac makeup so Heller
that sounds like the ultimate price tag
to me sir I will leave all the
information down below for you guys to
enter and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and
start showing the makeup because I
haven't had bulk new Mac makeup in a
while so I'm like super excited about
this and also all the clothes and we
share with you are very appropriate for
winter which is what I needed because
every time I was going online shopping
it was all wasted like summer clothes
and it is literally for raising at the
moment it is so cold and I don't know
how to deal with it so the only way I'm
gonna do with it is getting new clothes
you kidding me well I'm pretty bloody
happy that princess Polly is now soaking
Mac so let's do this okay so the first
thing that we have here is the Mac
Studio Fix fluid foundation I have three
shades right here I
just had a heart attack these are glass
oh my god that reminds me when I was
like in grade six actually that's really
dramatic great single scenario I wasn't
even wearing makeup in grade six when I
was in high school I had like my first
bottle of Mac Studio Fix fluid and I
dropped it on the tiles and it's smashed
everywhere now I'm like scarred I'm just
gonna really careful with this but yeah
I have SC 30 SC 40 and NC 35 they all
look like really good shades I'm going
to try my methods to match that to my
skin I feel like and see 30 it looks the
best it's more like a neutral term but I
haven't used this foundation in the
longest time and a lot of freelancing
makeup artists always like stick to this
foundation so I'm super excited to give
it another go
see how it is always love trying a new
foundation sorry next of course we have
the MEK a little look the Mac prep and
prime at fix+
so I mean this has been everyone's
makeup kitty kitty this is a fresh ones
ready to get ready there we go it's the
perfect way to like refresh your face
but I particularly like to use this to
wet my eyeshadow brushes so my shirt
looks really foiled or I like to use
this to wet my highlighting brush so my
highlighter is a really dramatic it just
always comes in handy it's great so next
we have the Mac prep and prime the skin
base of eyes edge watching that wet I'm
pretty sure again this is something that
I use all the time when I was younger
but I finished it up and I never really
got around to getting it again so cut my
chooses in some videos coming up and of
course we have a staple
lipstick from Mac that I had to get it
is the MAC lipstick in the shade
dominatrix eyed now that I'm looking at
it I guess it's different on everyone's
lips because sometimes Michael wears
like a nude lip and it literally looks
pink and then I wear and it looks nude
in their new from I don't know it's just
it's weird it's just weird how it works
okay I have to share this with you guys
because this is something that I haven't
used before it is the bronzing powder in
the shade golden so I have this shade
refine golden and that has been my
favorite bronzer flex six months ever
since I bought it but this is a
different shade so I'm excited to see
how this one goes I just love like
orangey bronzes and this looks like it
has tiny little specks of like shimmer
in it which is amazing I don't like
really met bronzes if I do have a matte
bronze
usually go with a shimmery one anyway so
if it's kind of like two-in-one I'm down
for that completely and of course we
have a fresh one a fresh highlight of
the so yeah soft and gentle highlighter
this is also another staple that always
looks incredible on so many different
skin tones I'm gonna Simone Hall I
already have it sorry much I let her
right now about like I know you can
never have too much you know oh so
pretty
cuz you can bury like a really dramatic
with this or you can like keep it really
subtle if you like me then huh crazy
lastly I mean honestly I have so many
things here but I really want to get
into all the clothes we have like all
these eyeshadow palettes
we have a highlighting palette right
here which is so pretty this one is
called the hyper real glory yeah you
know Mac has a million different things
and they stocked so many different
products on the website now but lastly I
just want to show you the Mac lip
pencils because again these are one my
favorite brands of lip pencils we have
the shade well strip down and boldly
bare I have all three of these they're
literally like half the size because I'm
use them so much but these are like the
perfect nuni Brown pinky shades right
here my favorite Mac lip liner is in a
shade spice and if you don't have it you
need to get it I'm not even kidding you
I always have read and music breaks just
to like keep hot it's great I'm really
sorry if you can see my ponytail like my
actual real party tell in this video
it's just there this I'm gonna put it
back y'all oh my god I'm like so open
about how fake my hair is right now I
love it it's time for the clothing haul
okay so let's start with some denim
because as you guys know I'm really
obsessed with denim I mean you probably
didn't know that because I mean I don't
know why I expect you guys to know
everything about me I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna stop sorry the first thing
that we have here is a pair of
high-waisted jeans and I've been looking
for these for so long
sorry I have these in like a short
version but um I'm all about the long
pants recently one I don't have to like
tanners often anterior I don't have to
shave as often three it's absolutely
freezing so I just love how these are
super cinched around the waist and I
love how highways that they are I love
how they're nice and distressed they're
not too tight you can roll the bottoms
up if you want to like make it more
casual you can chuck some boots on it
like there's so many different ways that
you can dress high-waisted jeans next we
have at this the denim jumper right here
I feel like it's not too much to say
about this this one's just like a very
basic denim jumper but there's so many
different ways that you can wear these
kind of things and like dress them up
dress them down and I just feel like I
needed a new one in my collection
because the ones that I have right now
I've won a million times I absolutely
love denim and I love wearing denim on
denim so I just thought this would be
the perfect little guy to put in my
collection okay I have another pair of
denim jeans that I have to share with
you guys because I just love the cut of
these ones so again these ones are super
high-waisted these are like more of a
lot a lot of wash of denim I think this
is just like the classic mom looking
jeans I just loved them so much I'm not
true like tightly fitted that's what I'm
talking about see stop oh that was
really strong lien okay this is gonna be
me trying to be kind of classy and kind
of like elegant so this is what you have
right here this is a blazer it's like
very rare for me to wear black and white
but I know I just saw this I was like um
I need that in my life II need I feel
like this is giving me like corporate /
sexy vibes sir I think I'm gonna wear
like a lace bra little a sprawling under
it which everyone likes to talk about
because they don't like me wearing won't
dry out in public well I like wearing my
dress public and then wearing something
kind of like
the top I feel like it's like it's like
sexy but it's not Shani likes the denim
lightly obviously so the next thing that
we have is this set of overalls right
yeah I feel like this would be perfect
for a festival and I do have a few
festivals coming up I'm just worried
that it's gonna be freezing so I'm gonna
have to find like maybe like a fur coat
or something to wear with these fun this
would look really cool with a bralette
under it and then maybe like one of
these can be done on one can be let down
and then this can be unzipped I just
think this is like a it's like a really
unique piece I like it okay this one is
totally up my alley this one's like a
cotton dress that comes off the
shoulders and it ties up around the
waist which I love because I just hate
when you wear something and it takes all
the shape out of you so I always love
when there's like an option to like
cinch the waist in and kind of make like
an illusion you know so this material is
nice and thick so I feel like this is
perfect for the weather right now and
it's not too restricting around the arm
area which I love because you know
there's nothing worse than when you wear
something that goes across here you're
gonna can't lift your arms past here
that's like always the worst I have a
bunch of tops to share with you guys and
when I first saw this one I was like I
have to get it I just love the way they
styled it on the website so it's just
one of those tops that does up around
the front here and I'm gonna wear like a
nice Brella under it because the
material is kind of Shia I don't know
what it is but I have this really great
obsession with like poufy sleeves I just
think it's like it's unique it's like a
little bit different so yeah I think
this is too cute did you notice oh I
don't my makeup though the next thing
that we have is this emerald green
cropped sweater this one is a little bit
flared around the wrists and I like how
its kind of tight like underneath the
bruise because me personally I have like
bigger boobs because I got boobs off and
I just like how it kind of sucks in
underneath here otherwise I feel like it
makes me look a little bit big because
you know it's gonna be sitting out here
with me breasts and quickly I just want
to point out a few people were saying in
my last hole that I was complaining
about having big boobs and if I'm ever
saying like I like how it sucks in under
my boobs or like if I'm ever saying oh I
have big boobs it's not because I'm
complaining about it I'm I was willing
to pay for the boob job so I don't I
don't stand how people think I'm
complaining I just like to address how
some things fit on different route
shapes so that's the only reason I'm
saying stuff like that but don't worry
I'm not complaining about them I
absolutely love them and I think they a
very important with my shoulder
because my mom fortunately gave me large
rural trailers thanks mom love you
somehow anyways I need to relax anyways
the next thing that we have is this
black pot right here I just thought this
would be perfect to wear with those
jeans that I've showed you at the start
of this video and they're like a really
big fluffy coat or something so this one
has like the short little sleeves on it
and it has the buttons up front right
here and it's also like a room's
material as well so it's not true basic
its own got something some add to it the
next top that we have is sorry cute oh
my god
if you tell I like green lightly love
that this one is another crop right here
again that would be perfect with the
pair of jeans that I showed you at the
start or you can wear like a nice little
dressy skirt with this I think this
would be nice to like go out in but I
like how you can adjust this one
underneath the boobs you wouldn't like
make it really cinched this is like the
perfect summary table I'm kidding it's
criminal I actually do clean out some of
my closet like every black three months
because the amount of clothes that I
accumulate is kind of a joke but I kind
of love it
gonna like I love a simple dress that
you can completely dress it up with like
heaps of jewelry and like a nice bag so
I got this a red short dress right here
I really like how this is super
structured around the waist and then it
has like the bra kind of caught things
at the top I don't know I just like how
it's really basic but it's like really
chic at the same time and it reminds me
a lot of the dress that Selena Gomez
full to one of the red carpets ages ago
if I can find it here but she looked
absolutely stunning and I was like oh
speaking of red I got a another leotard
I have a bunch of these but I didn't
have a red one so I thought I'm just
gonna add this to the collection so I
love that this isn't say threw around
the cup area because it's nothing worse
and when you have like all these
leotards and you might nipple cover it
and then you get a flash spreader and
you can see like the outline you're like
is that a nipple or is that a nipple
couple and then we have another oh wait
this is my first win up absolutely I
already won this one this one's so
comfortable it is a really baggy sweater
and my favorite thing about this is that
I'm you can wear it like off the
shoulders and I love like putting like
lots of highlight on my chest and then
chucking one side off and then wearing
high-waisted jeans with it and then
tucking like the front of this it'll
look sorry good the material is like
nice and thick but it's not like too hot
because it's like kind of little holes
in there sorry I don't know I just feel
like this material is really nice it's
very like heavy I know it's like for you
guys wondering I go to say
small which is an 8 in everything if you
guys were like curious last but not
least I have this cropped jumper right
here I'm clearly loving everything
cropped recently ok
I am literally dying because on the
inside of this jumper is like this
really very wooly material and anything
comfortable I'm like totally down for
and this is like cute and comfy at the
same time so he'll re well this is me
last should be really struggling to get
this on online this is the most
comfortable jump ha I have literally
ever tried all my pocket wet is to bed
and be completely happy with my life
anyways guys there we have the finished
hole again if you want to win $2,000
worth of a princess Polly and Mak makeup
