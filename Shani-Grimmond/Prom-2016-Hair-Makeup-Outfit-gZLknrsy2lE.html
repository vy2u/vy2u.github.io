it's Shani and welcome to my channel so
let's jump straight into this I'm
starting out with my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm just using this to
prime my eyes so this does an amazing
job at just cancelling out all of that
discoloration and hiding the veins so
after that I'm going to go ahead and set
it just to make sure it's not tacky and
then when you put eyes shadows over the
top it just blends super seamlessly for
the eyeshadow today I'm taking my morphe
35n palette and I'm picking up a peachy
brown color and this is going to be my
transition shade so just putting that
from inner corner to outer corner to
make sure the darker colors that we put
on the lid it kind of just blend up into
this color really nicely with that same
eyeshadow palette I'm picking up a
really rich warm brown and I'm going to
create a halo eyeshadow look today so
I'm going to pack it on the outer corner
and also the inner corner and I'm just
going to leave the middle free for some
glitter because we have to have glitter
for formal or prom whatever you guys
call it where you live next step is to
go ahead and blend it so we have no
harsh lines so I'm just using a really
big fluffy brush for that and then I
like to go ahead and keep packing it on
and blending packing it on just so it
looks gold giuse and then it's time to
clean up those edges and make it look
super sharp and now it's time for the
fun part so I'm taking this glitter from
glitter injection so before you guys get
excited because look how amazing it is I
know it's incredibly pigmented
apparently these glitters mold after
four months so I wouldn't actually
recommend getting this product there are
a lot of other amazing glitters and
stuff you can use I will keep you guys
updated though but I'm just warning you
I'm pretty sure it does get moldy
the next step is to nourish the face so
I'm taking the vitamin enriched face
base by Bobbi Brown this is amazing
especially if you have really dry skin
it just really hydrates it and makes the
foundation going super smooth so I'm
just going to buff this all over my face
with this little stippling brush from
morphe I recently got a bunch of new
multi brushes and they are incredible
would definitely recommend them for
primer today I'm taking the Laura
Mercier foundation of primer this is in
radiant so it gives a super nice glow
but it's nothing dramatic because
obviously when you're getting what the
photos and stuff all day you don't want
to look overly shiny but this just gives
you a really natural glow to the face
it's gorgeous
full foundation I'm taking the ideal air
flash this is absolutely incredible the
only thing that I don't like about it is
it's super messy I even had to clean my
bloody lens this has a really really
nice full coverage when I went to formal
I definitely wanted a full coverage so
that's exactly what I wish I wore two
years ago my formal it is so stunning
the color match is spot on and it lasts
for ages so I'm just dipping this on
with a makeup geek brushes is amazing as
well I personally did my own makeup for
my formal and it was so scary and
stressful so just a warning you should
get a lot of practicing before your
actual formal day oh god I was freaking
out but it turned out really well you
guys can do it I believe in you girl now
it's time for concealer I'm taking my
Maybelline instant age rewind in the
shade at lack pale I haven't used this
for so long and I missed it so much I'm
just putting this under my eyes and down
the center of my face and it's nearly
empty so I have to go buy another one I
swear to god I've been through like
three of these it was just like the best
drugstore concealer ever I would
definitely definitely recommend it and
this color is perfect if you want like a
really highlighted effect under the eyes
Gorge now it's time for a little bit of
cream contouring or one of my favorite
steps so I'm taking this palette by
morphe and picking up the true darkest
shades on my Beauty Blender I think a
Beauty Blender is the easiest way to
work with cream contouring because it
doesn't like take off any foundation so
what I'm going to do is Pat this under
my cheekbones to really carve them out
and also around my forehead and on my
jawline to really
runs it up to make it look like we
actually went outside and got some
suntan hmm now I'm taking my loose
setting powder by Laura Mercier this is
in translucent so I'm just going to pack
this under my eyes with a Beauty Blender
and this just ensures that the concealer
doesn't move throughout the day and just
keeps it locked in place now taking my
Anastasio dip brow pomade I'm just going
to fill in my brows as I normally do I
use this product just because it is very
very long-lasting and it will not smudge
off at all on your big day and then to
set my brows I'm taking my Australis
brow tint and I don't really show me
filling my brows in that much just
because it's boring and everyone has a
different eyebrow shape but I do like
this step I would recommend getting this
product it's great and then I'm going to
go ahead and put some Laura Mercier
translucent powder all over my face to
set the rest of the foundation and I'm
also going to wipe away
MoBay kitc taking that same lid color
I'm going to put this on the lower lash
line and same concept with the lid I'm
going to put it on the outer half and
also the inner half and leave the middle
free for the glitter and with the
transition shade I'm going to take this
again the same concept as the lid and
just running it under the lower lash
line to really blow it out and make it
look some mochi
to add a nice pop to the inner corners
I'm taking this a makeup geek blush in
the shade shimmer shimmer and packing
this on with a pencil brush and then
taking my revlon mascara i'm gonna coat
my lashes make them super thick and prep
them for falsies i use two separate
mascara for my lower lashes to make sure
they're really long and spidery this is
a mock mascara so to highlight my brow
bone I'm taking the makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade light lives this
is a matte shade I don't want to add any
more shimmer since well look at the lid
honey
taking these beautiful lashes by Lily
lashes I'm just going to pop these on I
honestly feel like adding lashes to a
look just make it look ten times better
ten times more glam and just put
together next product is my NYC smooth
skin bronzing face powder so I'm just
going to put this under my cheekbones to
really bronze it up and also around my
forehead so pretty much the same places
as the cream contour except this is just
going to make it ten times more dramatic
just how I like it you guys obviously
don't have to be as dramatic as I am but
if I could go back to formal this is
exactly what I would do and then to
finish the bronzer off I'm just going to
add a little something else this is the
matte gold deposit it has a bit more
shimmer in it and it's a little bit more
orange so I just wanted to be that touch
more dramatic so just putting that in
the exact same spots as the last product
with my Rimmel stay matte powder I'm
just going to kind of bake it's much
easier than baking so I'm just going to
take a really small pointed brush and
brush this under my contour to clean up
any lines this powder is incredible so
if for blush I'm taking my NYX blush in
angel and I'm just going to put this on
the apples of my cheeks this color
matches any makeup look and I love the
formula of this product especially for
the price now it is time for my favorite
part highlighter this is the artist
Couture in the shade Illuminati if you
guys like intense highlighter this is
calling your name so this is in a powder
form I guess that's why it is so intense
so it is super easy to go over the top
but girl I love it so much
I love it to contour my nose I'm taking
that same bronzer the NYC bronzer so I'm
just taking this on each side of my nose
to make a look a bit more pitched you
know how it is girl and then with the
NYC contouring and highlighting palette
I'm picking up the yellow banana shade
and I'm just taking this down the bridge
of my nose to make it like highlighted
so it appears smaller and I'm also going
to take this under my eyes to highlight
even more because I love being dramatic
just quickly I forgot to highlight my
Cupid's bow and also the ball of my nose
so I had to do that now taking the or
what's your type mascara by the balm I'm
putting this on my lashes to make them
even longer because I feel like they
weren't long enough for me this mascara
is a really wet formula so it made them
super dramatic for the lips I'm taking
the balm lip liner this is incredible
and they go to the other day and so far
so good so I'm just going to line my
lips with this
and then for the lipstick I'm taking
this a MAC lipstick in the shade
stock and I'm just wing this all over my
lips and because this was a lot lighter
than the lip liner I had to go in and
blend the two and I really really liked
how they turned out and of course to
finish off the makeup I'm taking my
Urban Decay long lasting makeup setting
spray I swear by this guys this is a
Holy Grail in my makeup collection now
it's time for the hair I'm just going to
go ahead and rush it get out all the
knots and next step is to put some dry
shampoo in it this is the batiste dry
shampoo my favorite brand ever it is
super cheap I'm just going to put this
in the roots of my hair to make it look
super fresh then I'm going to part my
hair to the side you guys obviously can
choose whatever part you want middle
part looks nice too I just wanted to
kind of change it up a little bit so to
curl my hair today I'm taking this nume
curling wand and I'm going to take
little sections at a time and you guys
can tell I like never curl my hair
because look at this the first color I
try to do I stuff it up and yes I bit
myself like three times anyways I'm
going to curl this away from my face
because I like that effect the most I'm
going to hold it on for about 15 seconds
to make sure they're super tight since
my hair is so long it just drops all my
curls drop which is super annoying so
that's why I did hold it on for so long
and I was like please don't die please
don't fall out ah
have you guys seen that video where like
that girls like curling your hair and a
big chunk of her hair falls out oh my
god I bobby pinned my fringe up just to
make sure it was really tight so I left
it there until it dried and then it's
time to take it out rush it out make it
look super flowy and big and flirty then
I'm going to take some hairspray and
just spray that in scrunch my hair up to
make it as big as possible so that is
the hair and makeup done I'm going to
give you guys a quick close-up of the
makeup and show you the beautiful outfit
you guys are going to love it
