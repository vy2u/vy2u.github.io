my channel in today's video I'm finally
doing a question and answers I haven't
done one of these in such a long time
actually since I moved into this house
so I asked you guys to ask me questions
on Instagram at SHINee grim and I hom
read them yet so let's go ahead and get
started
holy God is 1,300 freaking questions
load load load load lore
first question is has anyone ever gone
beyond your personal line of respect
sexually so there was this one time at
schoolies where I was just walking on
along and I met so many of you was at
schoolies it was amazing and this one
girl I'm guessing was really drunk she
came up to me we got a selfie and stuff
and she grabbed my boobs and I had no
idea what to do she was form like
cupping my boobs and I was just like huh
no and I kinda just like walked off it
was so awkward and I don't want people
touching my boobs but yeah that's pretty
much like the only thing that's happened
I mean when I go like clubbing and stuff
and boys walk past and they like slap
girls bums that really get to my nerves
it happens all the time when I go
clubbing it's just so disrespectful and
I cannot stand it next question is or
what do you do to relax so recently I
found this TV series that I've been
literally obsessed with it's called
orange is the new black I'm sure you
guys have seen it and if you haven't you
have to see it it's taken over my life
oh my god I'm obsessed with it it's
about these girls that are in prison and
it just has like so many exciting things
that happens like you know how some TV
series like it really dragged out well
this one has like different things
happening like every episode and I'm
just obsessed with it next question is
have you ever got into a fistfight no I
have never got into a fistfight and I'm
never planning on it I hate fighting and
the lover not a fighter so pretty much I
got a message the other day I get this
all the time and someone's like I know
it's time that's gonna bash you because
apparently you did something to her and
then like they're runnin on us on tumblr
seriously get these messages all the
time it's so annoying and I'm just
thinking the back of my head maybe
someone actually is gonna bash me what
am I supposed to do while that's
happening do I run away do I hit them
back I hate fighting so much next
question is how many guys have you slept
with I have slept with what is your most
embarrassing moment in high school I had
a lot of embarrassing moments in high
school my whole life is pretty much an
embarrassing moment
I'm kidding but there was this one time
where I was in my early childhood class
so learning about babies and all of that
and I had my period at the time and I
didn't get my period really late so like
I didn't really know what the hell to do
when it comes to getting your period I
had like a liner on and it was really
heavy and my period over flew over flew
I don't know if that's what I'm going
for but like I was sitting in my seat I
was like oh my god
like it's probably all over the seat
right now and I told my friend I'm like
hey Lee what do I do
and she was like I think you just need
to like run outside so basically I was
like missed I really need to go to
toilet she's like yeah sure let me
sonido and I'm like no I can't stand up
so she said my diary and I literally
like a ran outside it would have been
the most obvious thing ever so I got to
the toilets and I had blood all over my
undies and all over my school pants but
lucky enough you couldn't see the blood
on my parents because they were mareun
thank God so believe it or not actually
had a pair of spare undies in my back
like in my period bag so I choked my
other ones that got changed and I was
good as new even though everyone would
Anu yells like how old were you when you
first got pubes I remember this story
it's clear as day because let's be real
how could you forget a story like this
so pretty much I was in grade five and I
remember looking and I was like holy
crap cause it'll like that long and I
won't like the thin one so we'll act the
gross like pube hairs and I was like mom
I think I bought like my first pube down
there it's like longer than normal and
little blah and she was like married or
you're really right five and I was like
well I'm like seriously I go my first
peoples black this is so Gerson sorry
and she's like well show me then and I'm
like no because like I've always been
really weird about showing my mom like
my private parts I still AM to this day
I know some people have really come to
with that and that's fine but I could
just never do that so she never believed
me but hey I got my first P when I was
like right fine
and I remembered that night as well I
when the shower and I shaved them off so
I only had pubes for one day do you ever
want to have kids yes oh my god every
time I see a baby I just get so cocky I
just want to like keep them forever I
just want to walk up to someone be like
hi can I please hold your baby but
obviously that's like not appropriate
but in the near future
I'm kidding in like in the next five
years or something I want to have a
little baby obsessed with them and I
feel like
I would just be the best mom ever if you
could change one thing about the past
what would it be and why
so I'm all about lack everything happens
for a reason like I wouldn't change
anything but there was just like one
little thing in my mind I'm just like
why did I do that I think I was like
eight months ago - a year ago I just
cared about boys so much like I would
always just get fluffed over or
something that boys and it always just
be so sad and depressed for like weeks
and weeks I'm just thinking now like I
wasted so much time being sad about
stupid boys when I could be having fun
and not even having to worry about boys
and getting hurt and being sad like it's
not important the right boy will come
along eventually it just happens
naturally and that girls feel like
getting hurt from girls like anyone that
you were seeing or whatever you can be
sad about it for a while but there's no
point dwelling because really not I
learnt the hard way and now I'm happier
than ever oh my god okay next question
is have you ever done cocaine I have
never done cocaine and I never plan on
doing it stuffing something up my
nostril is not something that I kind of
like think about doing it's just not
something that I feel like I would enjoy
so no I'm surprised with how much I get
this question are you rich trust me if I
was rich I would have a mansion I would
have a Ferrari I would have new makeup I
would have a walk-in closet I would have
it all do so this morning I woke up to
bindis butt in my face and she had
Dingle berries hanging from her bum
if you don't know what Dingle berries
are you need to google it it didn't
smell nice you'll barely do with it baby
that's my dog language but anyway that
is all this question and answers video I
hope you guys liked it bhindi certainly
loved it she sat on the ground for the
whole video and listen to all of it if
