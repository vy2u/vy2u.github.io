video is going to be a makeup tutorial
on this look right here this is the look
that I wore in my most recent haul and
so many people are requesting it so of
course I went ahead and did it and I'm
basing this look around one I shadow
palette and that is the Coastal Scents
revealed 2 palette there are so many
stunning colors in there so I basically
did a purple smokey eye with a pop of
gold on the lower lash line and I just
love the way that it turned out so let's
jump into it
first of all I'll be priming my face
with the Mac prep and prime skin base 5h
and then moving on to foundation I'm
taking my L'Oreal True Match and at my
alumi just to get the right color for my
skin because as you can tell I have fake
tan so my face is a lot lighter than at
my neck so I'm just trying my best to
match them up together and I'm going to
be applying this with my flat top kabuki
brush by Sigma which by the way is
amazing moving on to eyes I'm taking my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and this will
just cancel out any discoloration on my
eyelids and will also make sure that the
eyeshadow stays on all day so now I'm
taking my Coastal Scents revealed 2
palette which is the star of the show
and I'll be taking a dusty rosy kind of
pink color and I'll just be packing this
all over my lid with a flat shader brush
from Mac taking a maroon berry shade I'm
just going to be packing this on the
outer third of my eye this is such a
stunning color and I'll be taking that
on a BH Cosmetics flat shader brush and
to blend everything out I'm taking the
Too Faced natural eye palette just a
warm brand from that palette and I'm
taking that on a 40 by Sigma just to
make sure all the colors blend out nice
and seamlessly and then after I've used
that brush I like to swap with a
different one to make sure it is
definitely blended and then I'll just be
going back and packing more of that dark
purple on the outer third of my eye just
to make it more intense and now moving
on to concealer I'm taking my Maybelline
instant age rewind in the shade light
pale and I'll just be using this to
highlight under my eyes and also in the
center of my face and I'll be blending
this out with my Beauty Blender and
cleaning up my eye shadow as well and
then I'll be taking my foundation brush
and just blending that all out
for a nice pop of color on the lower
lashline I'll be taking this sparkly
gold on a little pencil brush from BH
Cosmetics I'll be putting that on the
inner corner to the middle and then I'll
be taking that dark maroon color again
and putting that on the outer half into
the middle of my eye time to highlight
I'm taking these two mapped highlighting
shades and I'll be putting this on the
top of my brow bone and at time for my
favorite part making my eyelashes really
big
I'll be taking my three favorite
mascaras and I'll have them all listed
down below with all the other products
as well and then I'll be lining my
waterline with my jumbo pencil in the
shade at milk and then I'll be applying
some falsies which are the red cherry
lashes and I stack them on top of each
other to get a nice cat eye effect and I
love the way that they turned out okay
now this was definitely my favorite part
now I'm taking my L'Oreal super lineup
brow artist and holy crap I think I
found a new Holy Grail eyebrow pencil
this is so amazing so today I'm going to
make my eyebrows really dark and I'll be
changing the shape of them quite a lot
so I'll be making them really thick and
yeah just basically changing my whole
eyebrow shape so when you're filling in
your eyebrows make sure that you always
go in with a spoolie just to blend out
all of that color whether it would be a
paddle or a pencil that you're using it
really does make a humongous difference
if you just take that spoolie and brush
them a few times through and as per
usual I'll be taking my benefit gimme
brow just to make my eyebrows stand up
at the front and also make them appear a
bit thicker and then to hide the lash
band I'll be taking my Maybelline and
master precise and just learning it
really really close to my natural lash
line going back in with my Too Faced
natural eye palette and the shade it's
expresso I'm just going to be taking
that on a a 25 at Sigma blending brush
and this is just going to change the
whole look it's just going to make the
crease look a lot deeper and a lot more
smokey and I love the way that it made
it look so I'm just gonna be blending
this in windshield wiper motions
all right so we are finished with the
eyes now I'm going to be setting my face
makeup so I'm taking my crush cosmetics
contour palette and I'll be taking a
really light shade to set under my eyes
and to set my foundation I'll be taking
my benefit hello flawless powder in the
shade honey time to contour so I'm
taking my NARS Laguna bronzer and this
is definitely one of my favorite
bronzers so if you guys are looking for
one this is perfect
so I'll be taking it on a Sigma small
contour brush and I'll be contouring my
cheekbones up on my temples and also on
my nose to make it appear a little bit
smaller
I'll also be going in with the l'oreal
glam bronze just to bronze up my face a
bit but somehow i lost the footage of me
showing it but anyways moving on to
blush I'm taking my Mac blush in the
shade at warm Seoul which by the way it
matches every single makeup look it's
like it's definitely one of my favorites
I love it so much and then for
highlighter I'll be taking my mary-lou
manizer by the balm on a little fan
brush by BH Cosmetics just to highlight
on top of my cheekbones
I love highlighter I never go without
and then for my lips I'm taking my
Jordana lipliner in the shade at tawny
just to outline the black outline of my
lips to make them appear a bit bigger
and taking my Black Label lipstick in
the shade a nude I'm just going to be
applying this straight from the bullet
and then after I've applied I'm going to
be rubbing it in with my finger because
it is a very very very opaque and then
to brown it down a bit I'll be taking
the Rimmel apocalypse lip lacquer in
this shade and nude Eclipse and this
will just make a look ten times better
and really really glossy as well so
there we have the makeup
so that is all person makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and if
you do recreate this look please tag me
