today's video I'm going to be reacting
to my very first videos and also videos
that I put on private you talk to
embarrass you guys to see them so we're
just going to go ahead and laugh myself
and talk about how embarrassing I am and
just talk about how I've changed because
I've honestly changed so much when I
first started YouTube about four or five
years ago now I was so incredibly shy
and I just want you guys to see how much
someone can change just from like
gaining confidence and stuff so let's go
ahead and start bagging myself out
this is so embarrassing I'm gonna cringe
so much in this video the first video
that I ever uploaded was the casual
night out with Chloe so let's see how
this goes
oh god where's Ariana every day
I'm not even look at the camera we go
this was 2012 five years ago so
that's motor who you are that is not
royalty free music shiny what are you
doing you guys don't know you can never
use popular music because you'll get
done for copyright so yeah obviously I
don't know the real second master finish
oh my god that's why I'm not showing the
products is because I was filming on my
iPhone on the back camera and I couldn't
see what was actually on the screen I
really hate doing on people's makeup I
don't know why I made this my first
video I literally like never do anyone's
makeup especially Chloe's I've done
Chloe's makeup like three times in my
life and this is the first time always
go look above the rabbit - that is so
cute okay let's go watch a video of just
me okay everyone the next video we have
is the common white girl tag so today
I'm just doing a little bit more on a
different video to meet your beauty
videos I'm going to be doing a tag and
it's called the common wekerle bow and
it's just basically me answering 23
questions okay can we just talk about my
lips and my teeth I think I look cute
but I am so happy that I got veneers not
only because of like the condition like
they were actually about to chip off
because that passed in they were but the
overall appearance on my teeth looks so
much better right now and I'm so blessed
for my dentist there's nothing wrong
with gaps I'm not saying that I'm just
literally bagging myself out like let me
do what I want to do and my lips as well
I had the smallest lips ever and I
really didn't like them so I am happy
for a little bit of injection that I
have in my lips right now
I mean people always like to talk
about injections like shut the off
because okay so now let's watch Mike you
a get to know me this is on private
honor that means gonna be embarrassing
really really hi guys so today I'm doing
the get to know me tag and then I'm
going to add a few questions in that I
asked you guys to ask me off tumblr so
like all trans guys I used to live on
tumblr seriously I was on there every
single day and people like oh hey guy
how'd you get through tumblr famous and
like oh look at I know I'd like to mm I
thought I was so cool oh so I'm going to
start out by doing Emily seduction for
you guys that don't know me my name is
shawni grim and i'm and you have
 eyebrows and the wing what are
you doing with your life thinking my
brother's a team man
oh shut up Thanks so annoying it's like
I'm just learning on it like my voice is
like monitoring like it's not changing I
have no excitement in my voice like
honey come on wake up
favorite song and this is left to work
question the option because my favorite
song changes like every two days so I
have no idea
I love Rihanna and like Beyonce and
Justin Bieber actually no I never listen
to Justin dudes music artists into hot
are you serious I literally grew up
listening to Justin Bieber am I going to
try to act like I wasn't obsessed with
him I just think you thought trying to
come on we don't know you're lying
oh my gosh we have to watch a makeup
tutorial hey guys and welcome back to my
channel so today Sierra is going oh my
god I look so skinny and makeup tutorial
on this look right here it's just abled
smokey eye and Andrews it so I think
you'd be perfect for any special
occasions such as a party or climbing or
anything like that so the first thing up
so mix of blending into my face so
yesterday I was called intimidating
disrespectful and I think I think that
I'm choosing other people so I'm simply
talking about that okay quickly let me
just tell you what I'm talking about
here so I was newly graduated at high
school I was doing my exams
and one of my teachers at school was
saying that I am intimidating and like
whatever the else she was saying
because I didn't come to my exam because
I had already finished it so I didn't
come watch everyone else to film their
exam so that's why she said it and I was
so offended I can't believe I came home
and feel
video because I would have had to face
her at school the next day and she
obviously would have seen it because her
daughter was like my age so I she really
got a show to have a video that's so
weird
oh yes just don't like it okay so I
wasn't told this by some anonymous on
tumblr like I always go hide on tumblr I
honestly don't my Bible called all these
names kind of thing from someone that I
see identically to my people
as I saw I just what I hate about
society is that a lot of people judge
saying I'm get deep honor to others for
the way they look by the way they dress
the way they speak and just in general
the way they present themselves I
remember my teacher was saying something
like because we were pretty mean my
friend and we I don't know it was so
weird saying that we're intimidating
because of the way we look and that's
why I got so offended and that's why I'm
trying to explain myself right here but
it seems to be not making any sense at
all oh my god I'm so excited to watch
this video
accent challenge wave problems and
embarrassing moments hi guys today I'm
doing a follow me around oh my god this
is the vlog where I told about a guy
that me over and then he texted
me after I uploaded so if you ever talk
about rina vlog again laughs laughs
laughs he's writing me off like a
 I have a little story to tell
you guys as to why I have not been here
for the last two months on YouTube very
much as much as I had a cool one too
true
oh my god am I seriously going to sit
here and blame a boy on why I haven't
been uploading for two months here we go
so as I've said on snapchat if you guys
draw I have been so so caught up in
reality hanging out with friends having
boy problems going out and just
socializing stuff and I didn't really
know what my priorities were as to
what's important to me and what I should
be caring about but now I know it took
me so long to be able to like through my
head on properly and all of that and I
kind of want to share with you what
happened
fine sorry I was seeing this blade right
and I really liked him he said that he
likes me well and then it got to the
point where I wasn't getting treated as
how I should have been treated so I was
just like interacting we should be
friends because you don't know how to
treat a girl
sorry and then he's just like no no give
me a wait till I pull my together
bla bla so I waited a week and he's just
like a week came by and he literally
texted me and he's like I think we
should just be friends like I don't know
what I want
blah blah and like oh my girl can I
please tell you why he texted me and
said I just want to be friends cause
like we'll kind of I don't know
Wednesday will like going to date but
will kind of like we had a thing going
on whatever and I heard that one of the
reasons why he didn't want anything to
do with me because was because I went to
a public school and because I had a
really really car so he was
like embarrassed that I was like well
Larry his level with like money and
stuff my bitch look at me now I'm so
glad I stopped talking to him what I did
because like who the doesn't talk
to someone who doesn't want to be with
someone because of a car they drive or
because of what school they go to I want
you guys to have no idea how so I was
here you guys need to hear I mean for
you guys that I oh my god I was so sad I
went to doctors and I said I don't know
why I'm so sad like I have weight
problems but surely weight problems
don't make you this sad and that's when
you put me on the contraceptive pill
because my hormones are going crazy I
remember I saw that guy out we're like a
year ago and you guys hey good to see
you go buy you a drink and I was like
yeah getting her two boys and dealing
with fake friends hey guys welcome back
to my channel I'm controlling well I'm a
baby nurse or well I can help I gave
myself some music like boom boom boom
next question is would you date somebody
that has already been in a relationship
with one of your friends definitely
definitely not if my friend is being in
a relationship with this place and
they wanted to date me I would just be
like I'm not happening I think it's kind
of girl / to not go there you know what
sorry sorry funny and I hate to say it
because I've never mentioned anything
about my ex-boyfriend online and I hate
to do it but regarding this question
never date someone that your friends are
in dated my friend is dating my ex nice
like he just had a baby like I'm happy
then like it's I'm just saying oh my god
there's a video in here that's like
really embarrassing and I remember
Michael was taking the piss out of me so
bad I have to find it it was a makeup
tutorial it was the winged eyeliner that
we line up hey guys it's shiny and
welcome back
Oh Michael just when I had a really bad
acne and before I've seen the videos I
put a little bit of tinted moisturizer
on my acne it was so bad but then I want
to look hill and my skin has been so
clear ever since I'm not like
recommending I'm just hanging up so my
skin cleared up from the edge of my my
eye we hack me I've been doing this
every single time I do Marcia okay well
I seem so insecure about it and now that
that's all cleaned up I'm going to go
ahead and give myself a wing with this
black liquid liner we go here we go
because I cannot do this on camera okay
so our theme is I'm you can't do it off
camera either what the is that
learn about nothing you I started
eyeliner so let's just see and I still
suck at eyeliner it settles later moving
on and now I didn't picture that way -
okay that's embarrassing I'm going see
you later
 that girl oh my god I have to watch
this with you guys this is seriously
like the best moment of my YouTube life
somebody please don't
but after all 40 oh yeah oh my god it's
so funny the stupid doll gets away
blessed by that okay - really cool bit
in this Lord where is it here making a
bribe sorry bad I really want to go to
my amplify again that seriously makes me
have so many Dru songs watching this
owner if you guys understand cuz like
it's hard to put yourself in my shoes
because obviously having my job and
start where and having people like
answering your name is like so surreal
but watching that back makes it feel so
 lucky like I love you guys so
much I guess like the point of this
video is to show you guys how much you
can grow and just like learn to love
yourself cuz when I first started I was
not discomforted I was not as happy and
now I am so incredibly happy my eyes are
blurry what the hell and I want to thank
you guys for that because of that you
I'd still be taking coffee outs people
and like I wasn't sad like I was happy
back then as well but right now I'm like
on another level of happy like there's
not one thing in my life that I want to
change I'm so incredibly grateful and oh
my god I can't believe how much I've
grown and it's literally all because to
you guys there's so many more videos
that I can go through me but I think I'm
going to leave it up here because this
beard is Winston Cup really emotional
and I can't bag myself out anymore cuz
I'm actually so around Muslim right now
so I love you guys so much you guys are
capable of anything you want in life I
will see you my next video mmm love you
guys
