channel so in today's video I'm going to
be reacting to my old Facebook post I am
honestly so excited the other day when I
was just scrolling through my feed I saw
this old stares of mine from like 2011
and I was like why did I write that that
is so embarrassing so I thought it Mazal
just go through all my old ones and just
judge myself let's just judge the old
shiny because really embarrassing okay
so let's do this I have my computer
right in front of me kind of good Oh
awesome the first one is from 2010 and I
wrote you've got to be kidding me so
much cheered shiny for such a little
girl like what's the point of the status
it's literally just me like asking for
attention
Chloe comments on it saying what's up
honey
I didn't reply all these other people
like what's wrong shiny dinner fly I
just wanted them to know I was mad the
next one is going to the Justin Bieber
concert dot that was back in the day
when I was like a massive fangirl of
Justin like literally obsessed I went to
the concert he came out and I cried I
cried Oh embarrassing is that
to be honest I'd probably do it again if
I went today I'd probably cry I mean
that was like when one time and stuff
was out I was just like a die-hard fan
obviously I had to tell everyone just to
make sure you know everyone's jealous
that I've got to take it and they don't
oh my god
I put putting the Christmas tree up
smiley face who in the right mind would
write a status saying that and then
Chloe comments
Chloe's comment is even better than my
status this is my best friend if you
guys don't know her but she commented on
there saying Oh mad dog and I was like
no I know this is gonna get so much
worse I can feel oh my god the next one
is it's so annoying when things don't go
as planned
I'm like complaining so much why don't
you shut the up oh my god I cannot
believe I scooped to this level I never
thought I did this but I did and this is
all about
remember back in the day how we used to
like well I'm gonna refer it to we
because I'm pretty sure you may have
done this as well when you used to like
copy and paste statuses and you would
say put this as your status and see what
people want a hug a relationship another
chance a friendship and then at the end
I wrote in box only how desperate can
someone get Shani
I mean everyone used to do it so I was
like oh my god it's the cool thing to do
I'm just gonna like copy everyone I
probably got no way boxes literally dude
oh oh my god this says you're all talk
get over yourself snob I wouldn't never
say something like that now like that's
 the next one is making up stuff
is the coolest I seems like a really sad
person on my old status is like really
sad why did I care about like what other
people were saying I just don't get it
god I've changed so much what is this
why would someone post this the next one
is you're taking all this too far love
why am I taking my anger out on like a
public platform that is the worst thing
you can do it makes you look so stupid
it's like the person is gonna see it but
is it just gonna make them more angry
but it's the whoever it's about an inner
who it about oh no I'm freaking
posting all of these like lyrics so the
first one is there is no guarantee that
this life is easy really really the next
one is it was only just a G so
embarrassing oh my god okay so the next
one is am i stubborn question mark ha I
can be stubborn a lot of the time and I
would have known that back in 2010 I
don't know why I asked people I was
probably like trying to convince myself
that I wasn't stubborn by other people
maybe I wasn't huh
there's the one that says Chloe just
said I need to burp to fit more waffles
in LLL have F smell why would I feel the
need to write that as a Stennis but I
know that something flow would still say
to this day for sure
me and Chloe were obsessed with each
other oh my god Chloe stop fighting I
don't know why we would always try and
embarrass each other by putting like
statuses up like that well there's
another one that says that I want to go
to school
SHINee really didn't want to go to
school mmm mmm
honey next one is tripped over a tree
stump at school today and landed flat on
my ass
ha got a mass graze on my arm and it
stings I was so cool I was very cool
this is how embarrassing so there was
like a football game playing and I do
not watch football I know for a fact
that I didn't ever used to watch
football or enjoy it but I just wrote
Queensland baby which is a team that I
was going for and then I wrote settle
down boys like come on Sean you weren't
even watching it and then I wrote aah
probably because like someone just like
got tackled or something like really
it's like I was pretending to watch
football just so like guys would see my
status and be like oh yeah she's into
football she's sort of cool that would
be why I wrote that and I have so many
regrets right now Wow I hate you what a
little petty ass bitch oh my god guys I
just found the cutest photo of me and
Chloe this was so so long ago when I
used to wear like the high-waisted pants
and the crop tops and all of my bits
would be hanging out it was so
disgusting but um do you remember
waiting like I think in like 2010
everyone went through a phase where they
would have like the side fringes that
would literally stop her over here like
that sweep over like that that's what I
had because apparently was cool to
follow trends of cyber inches honey ill
so they go a bunch of old embarrassing
posts I'm sure they get much much worse
if you guys want me to dig deeper let me
know in the comments below and I will
I just want you guys to know if you are
young if you are in school don't feel
the need to act a certain way or speak a
certain way to try and fit in with other
people because that's what I did when I
was growing up when I was in primary
school in high school I was so insecure
and I just used to follow everyone I
could follow like trends I would follow
how people acted just because I thought
it was cool and I thought I would make
more friends that way and it just wasn't
me so I think you really need to just
stick to who you are and just you'll
find friends that are compatible with
you I just wanted to be friends with
like the popular people because I
thought that's what people were supposed
to do I don't know why was I like oh as
soon as I left high school I found who I
truly was and I'm sorry happy with the
person that I am today I would never be
negative sadly like how I was in my
facebook post I would never post
negative stuff about other people ever
that stuff is so incredibly a little so
incredibly private and for me to do that
is just disgusting but like I was young
I didn't know like I'm not bashing
myself I think it's funny to look back
on and just see how much you've grown as
a person so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this video give it a big thumbs up if
you did make sure to always be your self
girlfriend okay I love you guys so much
and I'll see you in my next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
