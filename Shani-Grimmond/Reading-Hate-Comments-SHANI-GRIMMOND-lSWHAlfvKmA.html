my channel in today's video I'm reading
hate comments on my computer I'm
actually so excited because I find it so
funny what people make up and put on the
Internet
so I think there's a really really big
difference between constructive
criticism and just plain old hey so
let's just go ahead and laugh at all
these people that have no lives the
first one I see right here is I
personally find her to be highly
immature and obnoxious thank you almost
at the point where I initially thought
her spontaneous twitching and face
pulling was attributed to some sort of
mental slowness or learning handicap so
because I twitch a lot and I pull faces
apparently I am learning handicapped
I've actually always pulled faces I
guess it's just a part of my personality
and oh my god I don't know why but it
weighs just go through and I just like
move my shoulders around stuff so I
guess you could call that twitching but
I don't know I just like to be quirky on
my channel and fun and this is so sorry
about it but I'm literally sorry about
it I'm not sorry about it all my
favorite thing when I pull whack derp
face and stuff is when people send me
screenshots on Twitter and like make
their own like me it is literally the
funniest thing ever okay so this one
here says what the I'm Chinese
tumblr she said that she stayed up till
6 a.m. the previous night when she was
going clubbing so when I go clubbing I
usually say to a lookout if I'm feeling
the vibe so that's usually about 5:30 in
the morning so I usually start like
11:00 and then go to like 6 o'clock
morning that's just what I like to do I
don't see why like someone has a problem
with the time that I get hurt from
clubbing I maintain what do you expect
I'm just having fun
someone said to that answer so she's 18
exactly I'm 18 I'm an adult
well she posted up chats of her at the
gym only ever walking or jogging on the
treadmill doesn't she understand that 10
kilograms won't kill you well I'm
obviously not going to snatch out
everything at the gym so you do what I
do at the gym and I do spend a lot of my
time doing cardio so I do lots of like
jogging and running on the treadmill
thanks for pointing that out and I also
love going across wait is it called a
cross trainer
something like that I love that one I
actually do not like lifting weights at
all so yes
it will kill me Oh everyone's so funny
her eyebrows look like too painted on
slugs I have like really straight
eyebrows everyone says you need to
change your eyebrow shape but I like
them I like having slugs in my face even
Chloe's like I feel like you should put
an arch in your eyebrow and like North
there's actually a few people sticking
up for me on here which is kind of cool
because it's like a hate page this one
is the best one that I've read it's like
amazing okay so it says girl we get it
you have a boyfriend now nobody cares
and we all know Shawn cheated on you and
it was so awkward when youse broke up
because you had him all over your social
media didn't you learn your lesson okay
first of all Shawn and cheat on me I
have no idea where that came from I
actually spoke about it in a few of my
videos why I broke up we just weren't as
happy as we used to be and we'll kind of
like on the same page and there's no
hard feelings and then apparently you to
don me know the state of her bedroom in
her latest snapchat how do you go to
sleep at night I'm not the cleanest
person not gonna lie my room gets messy
very quickly because I work from home so
I'm always at home always doing
different things like if you had a look
over there right now you'd be like oh my
god there is so much makeup on the table
that's just me I'm sorry if that affects
your life so sorry okay so this girl is
very angry with me she rat for points
about me big paragraph and what she
doesn't like that me so the first one
here is at first she seemed shy and down
to earth
but now the fame has gotten to her head
what's with all the weird faces and
sounds that she makes all the time I get
we act silly every now and then but I
feel like she's forcing to be genuine so
because I make silly faces and act weird
that's me forcing to be genuine no
that's me being at me and I am still shy
you guys can ask any of my friends which
I've literally got one friend and that's
Chloe so ask Chloe but like obviously
I've been filming YouTube videos for so
long now that I've like become so
comfortable in front of the camera and I
would definitely say that I am known as
shy as I used to be which is amazing for
me I have grown out of my shyness which
is like the best thing that could have
ever happened because I hate being shy I
hated being like withdrawn from other
people so yeah I kind of am shy still
but like knows that
is what I'm trying to say oh my god I'm
getting like a little sweat patch right
here okay so starting people are like
bagging Lauren Curtis out right now on
my hate page so she's getting as much
hate as I am right now which is
ridiculous this one says I'm actually so
disappointed because I still live shine
it when she first started thank you
now she's definitely turning into a
Lauren Curtis with her inconsistent
uploads and her bragging in all her
videos I guess the game has got to our
head
well I upload every like three or so
days I do not see how that's
inconsistent and a lot of people do see
like making haul videos as bragging and
stuff but she's literally me showing my
new products I'm sorry if that offends
you don't watch my holes if it does and
the game will never get to my head I'll
always be down to earth I'll always be
humble bumble bee someone says my
cockiness is so annoying Thanks
okay so this one's like is it just me or
did she get a boob job I did not get a
boob job
at all my babies are actually getting
pretty big before I went on the pill I'm
like just randomly and then when I went
on the pill my boobs were like so much
bigger than what they were for sort of
like really big now but a lot bigger
than what they were um
and then on top of that I nursed the
time wet push-up bras cuz I love my buns
your bras and like so many people will
like oh my god Shani like your boyfriend
paid for your boob jobs in here I'm just
like no like my boob just grew I'm sorry
sorry I'm sorry about her new style is
so fake she'll be on the clearance rack
of which Ray doesn't make you classy
she'll be back a Kukai and then cheap
online boutiques in no time um I've
never gone off those online boutiques
not there like I love getting clothes
from there just because super cheap and
my style always changes I hate wearing
the same clothes all the time so that's
why I just get cheap stuff so I can
continuously change it up there's
nothing in my closet that I've had for
longer than like six months so that's
why I like to get cheap clothes and I
can't believe this person is shaming me
for lacking the clearance rack who does
not like the clearance racks that like
every shop so there is me reading hate
comments so if you guys have ever
received hey don't worry literally
everyone in the world gets it literally
I have ten pages of hate right here and
I don't care because these people don't
nothing about me I know that it is a lot
harder to deal with hate when it's from
people you know but
see they're not the people that you want
in your life because you want like
positive energy around you to stay
positive so that's pretty much the
message that I wanted to like put in
this video of breeding this hate stuff
if you guys can like see that I'm
getting hate hopefully you feel like not
as alone when you're getting hate as
well I know what's shocking people
should never give hate I don't see the
point of it at all we are hopefully you
guys found is amusing a little bit
because I certainly did and yeah if you
guys want to see more videos like this
make sure you hear this one a big thumbs
up and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
