my channel so today I'm here with my dog
and my boyfriend we're doing the
roommate a roommate tag so we're gonna
be answering lots of questions and stuff
and we thought Bindu should be a part of
this video because she lives with us and
she's like the queen of the house she
sleeps with us as well she's so spoiled
in between us
yeah first question is did you guys know
each other before you came became
roommates yes of course we did
so we're dating like four months before
you moved you moved in yeah Nobby never
lost like two months hmm that was quick
wasn't it next one is what did you guys
initially think of each other when you
first met it's just like doing a
boyfriend and girlfriend tag you're a
bit stunned the senior thing no I
thought you're gonna be taller that's
like the only thing that I thought I was
like aww you're small
I'm not really I'm taller than you yeah
I know but I just think it was expecting
to be like really tall
that's a we don't know told you that how
long did it take before we became
friends yeah we were never friends we've
never been friends we just started
talking straight away like when we met
like talking yeah that's friends in it
it's like flooding oh so it's not really
friends it's just like straight to the
cop yeah I guess it so notable we've
never been friends
still not hey what do you guys usually
argue about what um me not cleaning yeah
no yeah yeah I can angry though no good
you come home from work and you like I
can't help
bindis pissed on the carpet and the
dishes aren't done oh when you don't
want to fan on and I really want to
sleep with the fan on it's so annoying
cuz I have such good sleeps with the fan
on I'll be living on but she just wants
to turn on the highest yeah I love like
having the fan on like the highest and
then snuggling under the blankets and
also know that yes Cheney so nice so
don't waste money no I mean I've done
that since I was born
oh is it no you directed last night it
was good you're asleep it was like 12
o'clock and I got off and I turn the fan
on high when you're asleep it was only
I'm true though wait can we ask Mindy a
question yeah
bhindi why do you sleep on top of mummy
and daddy all the time but mostly mummy
what does she say me me oh my god this
is a good mom what's something you do
that bothers me or I do that bothers you
oh just not clean up after yourself I
think I'm always asked me how you live
in this house yeah because like I am a
kind of a messy person Emily a messy
person yeah but you're not like oh how
to scrub it when I get you get any
cleaning phase where you were like
cleaning for like an hour straight and I
went to our state and you don't stop
cleaning until the whole house is fully
perfect yeah like I have OCD sometimes
I've been other times I'm just like
really lazy and I just leave stuff
everywhere and he gets really annoyed
not really that we already like code
that one oh one thing that annoys me
okay when you leave your shoes in my car
because you have a really stinky feet as
soon as you take these shoes off it's
something else it's actually disgusting
why your feet stink - no because you
bought me shoes to wear to Sydney I
didn't you bring yourself ah so my shoes
yeah but your we need heard from walkie
take your socks off and they stink so
bad oh yeah
why and when he throws his socks in my
face like it's disgusting what do you
think about me doing YouTube coming home
to all these lights around my bed am i
doing a corner I would always think okay
no it's seriously what you think I'm
jealous
I'm kind of jealous about the whole
YouTube thing yeah because I can work
from home yeah I like for you I never
knew anything about YouTube until I met
Johnny and I still don't know a lot of
things it's literally it's like a whole
nother world Hey it is it really is and
you can meet so many people I think
everyone should study YouTube channel
yeah definitely what was something that
you didn't notice about each other and
until you became roommates I don't know
it's been different like we always spend
most nights together yeah we basically
live sweet so like we before we moved in
yeah no I know had him from your father
understand oh my god I said I was so
scared to fight in front of you like I
would literally get cramps in my stomach
because I was holding a fight in for
that long like I just couldn't I was way
too embarrassment now do I fly oh look
sorry though you're really bad do you
ever get fed up from seeing each other
too often um I know she does sometimes I
just like having like me time I have
like all day by myself anyway but
sometimes I just like to chill by myself
with friends how do you avoid tension
while living together
I just don't talk if we're like fighting
or something I'm obviously will living
together and I want to talk to you don't
talk to me I just go in a different room
and do my own thing pretty user tell
with her what if I'm not like wanting a
part of it I just go into the turn
what is one rule you guys have when
you're living together this sort of it
oh yeah I have to sleep on my side bed
and I just lay on it like anytime oh
yeah like if you come home you like
maybe ever I'm like Norwich is my side
the bed you can never see on this size
band unless I'm not home
yeah I cutting is cinemas on I was Lena
all day when she wasn't home that's your
home and all hell let loose do you make
two separate dinners at night no you
make my dinner for me don't you I
thought I would be the one to cook but
you cook I actually thought I would be
the one to cook dinner tonight
when we first moved in but then you said
oh cool you know it's like that's all
right oh I get but now I'm like hey so
when's dinner
Mindy just not the Cabana off the bed if
I don't cook we get takeaway talk a lot
I think I should yeah I think I should
start cooking but I don't know I think
you're just fair at it although
sometimes we do when she makes a tuna
morning Joran eat it
no one's the smell ocean no like I quote
things myself and offer both of us the
camera died yeah what is your
nationality
well bindi came from what's it's Moodle
so she is a sweet poodle cross Shih Tzu
cross Monte so she is just one of a kind
little Schmidt I shaved her myself
so what's your nationality um just
potluck English I think my parents ran
the English where's your accent I don't
have an accent why I mean I have a
little bit of English in me as well and
a tired New Zealand my dad's from there
um and then just Australian mud yeah
g'day mate do use each other's things
without asking all the
and I always usually close like as
pajamas or like around the house clothes
whether yours is mine
bhindi uses all of my stuff she eats my
makeup she makeup brushes always seeing
this running around with one yeah I can
own a house really and then she sees me
she's like it's really sky because she
knows I'll get angry
have you thought about having pets have
you thought about having kids I'm
changing the question do you have kids
yeah of course I wanted kids when I know
what's wrong how many more than one I
want to have to I think well maybe three
or maybe five hundred I think I would
have to I don't know a boy and a girl
well you can't choose son well yeah has
being roommates helped or hurt your
relationship that we help you can't he
it's definitely helped so Cox regression
no I think it's held as well cuz like it
saves us driving to and fro cuz you live
so he lives so far away well he used to
anyway and we see each other every night
anyway so it was kind of like we might I
said I've like 45 hours 45 minutes to
