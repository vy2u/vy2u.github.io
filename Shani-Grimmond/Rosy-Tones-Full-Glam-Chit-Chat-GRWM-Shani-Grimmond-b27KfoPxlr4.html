channel so in today's video I'm just
gonna do a chit chat get ready with me I
have so many new makeup items that I
want to play around with and I have a
lot to talk about because they haven't
really done a chitchat get ready with me
in it so long so let's go ahead and jump
into the brows because oh I looking like
a mess
I just plucked them and it took like 5
hours literally I'm going to start out
with the Adele medium brown brow pomade
just to fill those little bad boys in I
actually haven't used it before but this
is what it looks like right here if you
can't already tell I am very sunburned
all over my face so that's a lovely look
isn't it so I just got back from
Rockhampton which is where my
boyfriend's family lives just spent the
week up there and then I'm going to my
mum's house tomorrow for a few days for
Christmas so I'm really excited
you lerner it look very excited I'm
trying to concentrate okay well I really
like this stuff there so far I'm really
impressed so I'm just like making a
little arch right up here and then I'm
just gonna fill them in a bit underneath
because it's a bit sparse under there I
want to make them a little bit thicker I
hope you guys are excited for Christmas
I cannot wait to see my little brother
and sister open all the presents I got
them because I have spoiled them this
year same with my mom and dad and my
brother and Jonathan okay so now that I
look freaking crazy with the concealed
eyelid red face what is happening right
now let's move on to the eye shadow so
I'm gonna take the Buda Buda it heard a
beauty eyes shadow palette I've used
this a few times and I'm so impressed
with all of the matte formulas I think
that all of these ones are kind of hard
to apply because you have to use your
finger and I have nails on so I'm not
sure how this is going to go but I
really wanna do like a pink eye shadow
look sort I'm just going to go straight
in with this shade right here which is
called at flamingo and this is going
right in the crease I've never used this
shade before so let's see how it blends
not too much colours coming off all the
other colors I've use have been really
pigmented I'm pretty sure really bright
colors
like that are kind of hard to get really
pigmented on the first go but it's
learning out really nicely
you're just got to build it up a little
bit okay so next I'm going to take the
shade at me Anita which is this nice
Amarone pink right here and I'm just
going to take that on a smaller blending
brush and I'm just going to put this
right in the crease a woman up a bit oh
that's stunning this one is really
pigmented so I'm going to bring this
shade up nice and high because they want
this look to be super dramatic because I
haven't will make up in like two weeks
literally well at least full glam anyway
I'm just going to go back in with that
Flamingo shade and uses to blend out the
edges right up here just so it's still
nice and pink and then I'm just going to
take the shade up bossy which is this
one right here I'm just going to use
this to warm up the crease and darken it
just a touch on the outer half this is
just like a really small blending brush
it's so cute now I'm going to go in
where this shade or right here which is
called angelic and I'm just going to
start working this all over my lid from
my finger my holders me so hard because
I have nails oh that's such a pretty
color okay so now for the primer I'm
going in with the Too Faced hangover
primer I only just got this the other
day and so far I like it I kind of just
use it as a moisturizer I never really
take notice of how much a primer really
works like does it really make your
makeup soon well I mean it probably does
make your makeup stay on longer well
it's for real otherwise it wouldn't
exist now I'm going in with the Tarte of
rainforest of the sea water foundation I
have the shade medium 10 sand I've used
this a few times and so far I really
love it
so this one has a dropper I'm just going
to do one side of my face first like my
voice is sorry like
okay because I'm getting sick hmm but
how beautiful that just like glides on
the skin you have to make sure you're
using a brush as well because if you use
a beauty blender it goes a bit patchy so
for the past week I've just been
relaxing swimming going to the beach
that's why I'm so sunburned um oh well
it's not covering that's how bad it is
literally nothing ever sticks to my nose
so I'm gonna have to go over that area
out with B blur no frizz little minis
let me just take a moment to realize how
fast this year has gone honestly it
blows my mind like it's nearly 2017 in
literally like a week like what I have
so many things that I want to do next
year I have so many places that I want
to travel to a lot of things that I want
to create with SG the label oh I can't
wait now for concealer I'm going in with
this Becca aqua luminous perfecting
concealer this is actually really good
I'm in the shade good fair so I'm just
going to use this to cancel out all of
those little purple tones under my eyes
and also to highlight my face just went
from like red to yellow so I'd love if
you guys could leave down in the
comments below what kind of videos you
want me to make a 2017 considering it's
bloody next week or okay so now I'm just
going to take the RCM a original no
color powder I'm just gonna put some of
the back of my lid and this is so messy
and then I'm just going to bake under my
eyes so firstly make sure there's no
creases at all and just pack it on
I'm just keeping this right under my
eyes wherever that concealer and not
taking it down any further then I'm just
going to set my face with the Australian
flawless powder in the shade at medium
tan so I'm just going to dab that into
the pen and then dab it onto my face
don't want to swipe it or anything just
in case the foundation moves around and
we do not want that
this adds a little bit of extra coverage
as well now it's time for the lower lash
line so I'm going to go in with
man-eater
and just work this from inner corner to
outer corner add some pink under there
oh my god and then I'm just going to
take the shade up bossy and that can go
on the outer corner for mascara I'm
going in with the Too Faced better than
sex mascara if you guys know of any good
whiskers
let me know in the comments below I'm
just going to take a bit of the Mac
extended play gigablack lash just on my
lower lashes because the other one was
too thick like the one was too thick on
the better than sex mascara under here
I'm just going to coat these well I
think it's really empty now I'm just
going to pop these little lashes on
right here I have no idea where they're
from because they're actually Michael's
your they're so much like fluff in here
oh well now I'm going in with the lorac
Pro contour palette it looks like this
so what I did use the contour shades it
was really muddy so I think I'm just
going to stick to this banana shade for
under my eye today just because I really
don't want to stuff this makeup up up oh
yeah yeah I don't want to stuff it up
right let's just brighten up under the
eyes oh my god this looks so cakey
what's happening let's just not do that
because that is actually disgusting now
time for the bronzer so I'm going in
with this and Milani a bronzer extra
large all over glow
I mean mix both of the colors together
and I'm gonna pop that on my mother
something in my eyes is just going to
runs up my face this is a really
affordable bronzer so I'm not expecting
it to be like my Mac give me Sun or
anything but it still is adding a little
bit of color to my face which is what we
want I'm just going to go in with a
touch of maca me son because it's not
overly pigmented the one I just used so
I'm just going
to add a bit more orange to the face I'm
just going to bake a little bit under my
contour because it's looking a bit messy
just going to clean it up this is the
Laura Mercier translucent powder my god
I'm out of my second tub of Laura
Mercier this stuff is so expensive now
I'm going in with the Milani powder
blush in the shade zero one and I'm just
going to put this on the apples of my
cheeks I'm going to go in with a lot of
blush today because the eyes are pink
everything's gonna be pink and cute look
how pretty that is as a flower engraved
on it alright let's do this apples of
the cheek and then fall in back now I'm
just going to take this a cute little
brush from morphe it is the g37 I'm just
gonna dust away all of this bake just
really lightly I don't want to remove
the foundation around see how I just
cleaned it up a bit
yeah oh wow that's a bit too harsh my
bad okay so just for a second I want to
talk about the Ofra highlighter in the
shade at Beverly Hills if you guys don't
have any earth for highlighters you want
to sleep need to get it like they're
crazy
but I'm gonna use this in a different
video I just had to say that because
this is all I have been using lately but
I really want to try it the makeup geek
highlight is because I actually haven't
tried any but I have all the shades here
but I'm just going to choose my favorite
oh I'm sold this is gorgeous so I'm just
going to use this shade glitz and I'm
just gonna highlight oh oh you're
kidding whoa I hope you guys wearing
your spectacles cuz holy crap this is so
pigmented - like don't know if I've ever
experienced a highlighter so pigmented
in my life but I'm gonna have to go in
with a bit of my blush and just um you
know it blend it a bit now for the lips
I'm going in with this Milani a more
matte lip cream in a shade of 10
adorable I've been using this so much
recently it is the prettiest nudies pink
shade
like a baby pink it's so comfortable to
wear LLL cut foundation now i'm going in
with the anastasia beverly hills at
liquid lipstick in the shade and milk
shaker this is the ultimate lip color to
really brighten up the center of the
lips so that's exactly what i'm going to
do so last but not least i'm going in
with the touch jewy skin mist I really
want Chloe Sienna right even though
we're already glowing but I want to be
even more joy so let's do this well
there's like nothing that comes out of
it I feel like you have to add slowly
much it's so fine so here we have the
finished look I really hope you guys
