we are gonna go ahead and get straight
into the hair so I teamed up with the
new me for this video and I'm so excited
so I'm using the nume lustrum curling
one set this is a five and one so you
get five different sizes of barrels and
I'm just gonna go ahead and click my
barrel on and then I'm gonna spray my
hair with some heat protectant spray
because I don't want my hair she'll fall
out of my head after I've gone ahead and
brushed my hair out I'm then gonna spray
some texturizing spray in it because my
hair is so flat and it just doesn't have
any volume at all so this really does
help with that and then I'm gonna go
ahead and put my hair up into a high
ponytail and the reason I'm doing this
is because I want my curls to kind of
start like a bit lower than normal so
under my ears I don't know it's kind of
hard to explain but this is such an easy
way to curl your hair because your hair
is out of your face and I just find it a
lot quicker so I'm going to take little
sections at a time and start curling my
hair so I'm just gonna curl my hair away
from my face and I'm gonna hold it for
about 10 to 15 seconds so if you guys
have been watching me for a really long
time you would know I have been using
new me for about two or so years now I
love their products so if you guys don't
know new me sells like heaps of
straightening ones and styling sets and
just like professional hair care items
and they actually have like a really
cool holiday collection at the moment
called lustrous and you basically get
what I'm using now the lustrum set and a
hair strainer which i think is an
amazing deal and
really cheap as well so you guys should
definitely check that out I'm not gonna
lie I'm usually so lazy when it comes to
doing my hair like all of my straight
nerves and my curls and stuff sit in my
cupboard and I'm just like oh man I'll
just do my makeup and put my hair in a
bun but I'm actually so proud of myself
with like how this turned out
and I did manage to get you guys
discount cold so I'm gonna leave all the
information in the description as well
but you can get 20% off the whole entire
holiday collection using the cold
holiday wear shiny and the silhouette
for seventeen dollars and you can use
the code love shiny but yeah I'll leave
that all the l'heure if you guys not
interested but yeah enough of that I
just took out my hair tie and then I'm
just like gonna play around with the
curls and pull them out a bit and make
them nice and fluffy and this is what
they look like I was so obsessed than
when I saw them for the first time I was
like how did I do this
how now time to make my face super
flawless and glowy so I'm taking the
light Wonder Foundation and the Wonder
glow which is kind of like an
illuminating creamy kind of products or
I'm mixing them together and just
patting this into my face with and
makeup the extinct brush holy crap I
love this brush so much so this coverage
is actually really nice and just fresh
and dewy and healthy and I love it so I
went back and added another layer so I
could get more of a medium to full
coverage because I am all about that
life and I think it still looks pretty
natural as well so then for concealer
I'm taking my Maybelline oh that was
rude my maybelline instant age rewind in
the shade light pale and I'm using this
to highlight and conceal under my eyes
and just blending that in with that same
foundation brush this would have to be
one of my favorite concealers of life
living for this
now taking my laura mercier translucent
powder I'm just gonna Pat this under my
eyes and this really does a look that
consider in place it literally just
dissolves into the skin it's such a nice
product definitely would recommend this
for summer so now taking my Mac warm
neutrals color I'm just gonna take a
light shimmery shade and pack this all
over my lid with my finger
and then taking the shade sable by Mac
as well oh my god this is like one of my
favorite transition shades ever I was so
happy I bought this palette anyways I'm
taking this in my crease just to add
some definition with a little blending
brush and of course I'm gonna go ahead
and take a big round fat blending brush
and I'm just going to blend out those
harsh lines and then taking the benefit
high brow I'm gonna highlight my inner
corners and my brow burns this is
literally the easiest easiest way to
highlight ever
and for mascara I'm taking the
Maybelline pumped up this was the first
time that I use this mascara and it is
safe to say it is one of my favorites
already it literally works so well it
makes my lashes super long and spidery
and that is what I'm talking about and
then taking my Maybelline brow satin in
the dark brown shade I don't know why
I'm using so much Maybelline sorry about
that so I'm just gonna filling up my
brows and I'm kinda gonna do it
naturally you guys are probably used to
me doing really thick black caterpillars
but I really like how this just looks
natural and effortless so I started
using the pencil side to really create
the shape of my brows and then I'm just
setting it with the powder sorry for
bronzer today I'm using the hourglass a
radiant bronze black this is honestly
such a beautiful bronzer especially for
summer so I'm using something to create
a sharp line and this kind of makes it
look like you've contoured but you
actually haven't it's such a good trick
I know
so just bronzing up the face with this
product you guys like literally have to
test this out
and now for blush I'm taking the
hourglass mood exposure blush such a pre
pretty dusty brewery's color so I'm just
gonna add this to my cheeks for a nice
flush and it also has like a little bits
of Sheen in it as well so it adds a tiny
little bit of a highlight but I'm gonna
go crazy with my highlight today I'm
using these Stila in the shade kitten
and I'm honestly just gonna pack this
all over my face to add that summer gold
border that Tyler Glory
and now time to add some off to the face
so I'm taking the Australis below
ellipse in a shade Rio de it's a
beautiful orange red color on a sleeper
perfect for summer so I'm just going to
put this all over my lips and maybe even
outline them a little bit because I love
big juicy lip and I love this product
and then I realized that it smelt
amazing so I loved it even more
and then finishing off the makeup look
with some L'Oreal telescopic extra black
mascara on my bottom lashes this one is
so good for the bottom lashes because it
really gets in there because the Wonder
is super small okay let's move on to the
outfit so I'm wearing this jumpsuit from
a white box boutique it is literally so
cute and so comfortable so it perfect
for summer and yet though we have this
video I really really hope you guys
liked it and I will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
