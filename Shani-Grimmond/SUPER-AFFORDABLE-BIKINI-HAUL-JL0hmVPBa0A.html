channel sorry in today's video I'm doing
a bikini hole I was so excited to this
because I honestly have a serious
obsession with bikinis I love them so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video so I just want to say a massive
thank you so much to settle for sending
me all of these products they're
honestly amazing super affordable and
there's literally a million styles here
and you guys are going to love them
firstly excellent ASAE's FL has like a
lot of clothes accessories phone cases
all of that good stuff but I decided
that I'm gonna get literally a million
bikinis because that's what I like at
the moment surf let's jump right in the
first one that we have right here is a
white bikini so this one it's kind of
like a basic triangle one and it doesn't
like have a clip or anything in the back
so this is just like there's really
comfortable ones that you chuck on over
and I got a size of medium and
everything and I have a size D boobs and
I'm usually like a size 10 in the
bottoms and they fit perfectly so I'm
super obsessed with this one because I
just think the white is so crisp and
clean looking and it's like super
comfortable sir I'm down for that and
then these are the bottoms I'm in love
with like the super high cut for bikinis
I just think it's so in right now and
it's really flattering on the bouge as
well so that's amazing and I also got
the what would you call this like the
band or style it has like a little wrap
at the front I'm not sure if this is the
bottoms to it or if there's another pair
of white bottoms this one but either way
I really like this style so I'm gonna
use this stuff all of my white bikinis
for the bottoms and then just like
change out the tops because I'm obsessed
next up I got the same style but in a
really hot red color I'm obsessed with
this color just stands out so much and
then we have the bottoms again oh so
this must be the bottoms that comes with
the other white ones as well so this is
what the bottoms look like I love these
I'm gonna pull this out nice and high
but Vanessa shaky I would have to say
this is the most populous style in
bikinis at the moment so that's why I
got so many pairs but in like different
colors so the first of all that we have
is yellow
this has like a little tie up at the
front and then the bottoms are super
cheeky it has a this is cool it has a
material at the back that bunches out oh
I forget what that's cool yeah I think
these ones I'm going to look amazing and
if you're gonna be lost in the crowd
you're not gonna be lost for long
because they stand out like a sore thumb
oh my god you guys are gonna die when
you see this next bikini it's our cue so
this is what it looks like right here
it's like a little band door and then
you have little slots for your arms to
go on right here I just think it's like
super gully and like I don't have
anything like that either sir we also
have the bottoms this is what they look
like right here so this is like that
ripped material and I love again I love
that the watt is very very bright every
time I go to Bali I always get this
style of clothes so I got a lot of these
styles in the bikinis so it's that like
elastic material and this is like a
really nice unique delue turn I love
that
and then the bottoms are like this nice
and cheeky once again right up my alley
but I really like the cut of these
bikinis it's very different I don't have
anything like this one the next bikini
we have is this one right here so this
is like that checkered material I did
have a very similar pair like a few
months ago that I bought in Bali but
they didn't fit me anymore after my boob
job today so I wanted this same pattern
because I think it's super cute so again
this one ties up at the front I love
that style and then the bottoms oh yes
these ones are the high-waisted ones as
well so they go up like a be around the
hips trust me guys if you haven't tried
this style of bottoms you need to it's
so flattering I actually think this
bikini is probably my favorite so this
is what it looks like right here it's
that elastic material once again but
honestly I'm just so obsessed with this
color it makes you look so tan it's just
like a fluorescent orange and yellow
it's just in between the tree colors I'm
in love with it and it's super
comfortable as well and everything stays
inside when you like run around so I'm
quite happy with that honestly because
like after having big boobs for like a
while yes you can tipple popped out over
time and over so this is the bottoms
right here this one isn't as cheeky as
the rest which
which is good for a little bit of change
oh I love this ones this one kind of has
like the same shape as like a sports
Brad this one's like a really nice
maroon color and its really silky
material so it kind of reflects in this
Sun but you can take the cups out of
them if you prefer but I'm actually yeah
I'm gonna take them all out because like
I don't care if you see how a nipple
like it's fine I just don't want extra
padding in there if you don't I mean and
then the bottoms are super high waisted
which I am so happy about this is the
first pair of high-waisted ones enhancer
I'm very impressed
next we have this red bikini this is the
same one as the white pair that I showed
you at the stop but I had to get in red
cuz I love red so it's like that twisty
knot at the front and the bottoms of
these oh yes the V style thank you very
much alright so the next style is
actually very different to everything
else that I have so this is a red bikini
that connotes like a sports car as well
but it has the white outline so it's
something a little bit different and
then it has this seam that goes up the
middle of the boob to add a little bit
of something special and then we have
the bottoms these ones are like quite
literally a g-string so I'm loving that
I need to do some squats before I get
into the beginning so I like less Furio
the next pair is actually a one-piece so
this one's like a bright yellow color
and it has to cut out around the belly
and then it has true bows that tie up
around the hips but the bottoms are like
nice and high waisted so everything is
still like tucked in sorry this one has
the little cloth at the back as well
you've gotta do up but yeah it's super
cute next we have another one piece so
this one is it's super super white and
it is a backless it has like the criss
cross over the back and you do have a
decent amount of but in this one as well
and a lot of I might be trying this one
on I'm pretty sure it was a lot of side
very or a lot of cleavage one of these
but it makes the boobs look sari good
and it also has a seam that goes down
here as well which is nice of something
different I just love how unique this
color is it's like a really nice
sky-blue this one has a seam underneath
the boob I love the cut of this so much
that really nice silky material again
sir see what the bottoms look like
because I forget oh my god my favorite
style these ones are actually really
cool as well so the bottoms look like
this and they have the little tie up
things on the side so it's nice because
you can wear them a few different ways
you can pull them up nice and high and
you can adjust them which is amazing so
it's super comfortable and at the top
one second place looks like this
so it ties up right at the bottom here
but it has the hem all the way along the
bottom so it's just like a little not
for show but this is like a really nice
emerald green and it's like a rib two
material which is really nice and then
this one has the adjustable straps at
these ones are so cute so this is like a
very basic bikini I love this so it's
like a white the ribbed of banjo and
this one has like no clasp or anything
so just like pop it over your head but
the bottoms make it look so good so
these ones are high-waisted just like
this oh my god I'm so obsessed with this
style I reckon this is gonna look
amazing with a tan okay seriously I did
get one more thing and I have to share
with you guys it is this top that says
no bra club and at the rate I'm at I'm
not gonna be wearing a bra for too much
longer and I'm so excited so I feel like
to celebrate that I'm gonna be running
this I just don't know if I'll wear out
in public because everyone's just gonna
stare at my nipples by INRI what I
thought this was a cute thing to wear
around the house but anyway so we have
my whole I really hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did please give this video a
massive thumbs up and again I will leave
everything it down in the description
below I cannot wait to wear all of these
bikinis in person all over Instagram
because they're honestly incredible and
I love every single style that we have
sir I'm impressed I'm a happy girl I
love you and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
