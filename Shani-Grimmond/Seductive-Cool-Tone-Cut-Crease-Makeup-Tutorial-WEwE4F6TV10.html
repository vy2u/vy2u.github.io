go ahead and jump straight into the
makeup look I'm starting out by priming
my eyes with the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer this does an amazing job at
covering all of the veins so I'll
definitely recommend this for an
eyeshadow primer if you guys are looking
for one next I'm just going to go ahead
and set that down so all of the
eyeshadows blend out really nicely on
top I'm just using the Rimmel stay matte
powder love this stuff alright so now
we're going in with the Tarte tartlet
palette and I'm just picking up a medium
brown and this is going to be the
transition shade so I'm just taking this
on a really fluffy brush and blending it
from inner corner to outer corner you
guys know the drill this just makes it
easy for all of the other colors to
blend out on top of this easier
so now just going in with a chocolate
brown this is going directly in the
crease I'm just taking this on a small
fluffy brush and really working that
color up making it really intense so
starting from the outer corner of the
eye and then bring it to the inner
corner don't forget to go in with a
clean blending brush just to blend out
any edges so there is no harsh lines at
all and now I'm taking a concealer brush
with that same at Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and I'm just going to create a
bit of a cut crease so I've been doing
this a lot lately I love this technique
it's just a lot different to the normal
eye shadow all over the lid and in the
crease color it kind of just adds
something a little special so now taking
this blue eye shadow by makeup geek it
is absolutely stunning I just think this
is the prettiest color so fresh and icy
so I'm just going to pack this all over
where I put that concealer
now it's time for the face so I'm taking
the laura mercier radiance primer just
to add a bit of a glow to my face
because I do have dry skin so this looks
stunning underneath foundation and then
for foundation I'm taking the Estee
Lauder Double Wear this is a really good
foundation if you do have a loose skin
it's really going to stick onto your
face and as soon as I put this on my
face feels stiff how to make my face
feel dry so that's why I always like to
go with a really radiant primer but I
really like the finish of this it is
super full coverage and I really like
the color range that they have as well
so I'm just blending this in with a flat
top kabuki brush now I'm taking my la
girl Pro conceal I'm just popping this
right underneath my eyes to cancel out
those @ bluey purple tones I really like
this concealer considering how cheap it
is so I'm really just going to pack this
under my eyes and also down the center
of my face to highlight it and I'm just
going to blend this out with a Beauty
Blender if you guys don't have a Beauty
Blender you should definitely get one
because it is the easiest way to blend
out concealer now it's time to set that
concealer down in place honey so I'm
using the RCM a the original no color
setting powder and just packing this
wherever I put that concealer to make
sure it does not crease throughout the
day now taking my Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder I'm just going
to pack this all over my face with a
flat top kabuki brush this powder has a
lot of coverage so if you do have a
foundation that doesn't have a lot of
coverage this is the perfect powder to
go over the top to add that little bit
extra so I'm just brushing away all of
that bake and then we are ready for
under the eyes so I'm going to take that
same chocolate brown eyeshadow and just
put that from outer corner to inner
corner to really proportion out the
eyeshadow
then I'm just going to take this steel
up white eyeliner
Stila has the best eye liners for the
waterline they say on forever so just
putting this there to really open up the
eyes and then I'm going in with some
mascara this one is the Avon Lux mascara
so just cutting my top and bottom lashes
so we can get ready for some falsies the
lashes that I'm wearing today are from
Lily lashes I will leave my discount
code down below if you guys are
interested so now let's move on to
contouring i'm taking this contouring
palette by morphe and i'm starting with
this a medium warm turn contouring shade
just right under my cheekbones just to
start it off and then I'm going in with
this darker shade right here to really
define the cheek so this is a bit darker
and I'm going very light handed with
this shade and it looks absolutely
stunning I always like to make sure my
face is glowing so I'm going in with my
gold deposit and just putting this on my
cheekbones and also around my forehead
this just adds a bit of Sheen it's
nothing too shimmery this is a step that
I love to do so I'm just taking a banana
shade and putting this under my contour
just to clean it up and make it look
super sharp so this is just a step you
can do instead of baking it's just
easier and it's neater and it works just
as well so now it's time for highlight
I'm taking this one by Too Faced of
course I'm spraying some mac fix+ on my
brush before I highlight and then I'm
going into town putting it on top of my
cheekbones down the center of my face a
bit of everywhere because I love that
glow now I'm just taking this Kylie lip
pencil in a shade exposed I love this
shade so much it's very different so I'm
just going to go ahead and align my lips
and might even over line them if you see
my last video then you would know how to
get big lips in lesson 5 minutes I'll
leave that link down below if you guys
are interested in that so now going in
with the Kylie cosmetics liquid lipstick
in the shade
as well and just popping this all over I
love the formula of these lipsticks they
feel so incredible and they're nice and
hydrating I am so incredibly impressed
whoa
lastly I'm going in with the NYX Joey
finishing spray and I'm just spritzing
this all over my face because as I said
before I like to glow honey so I hope
