let's go ahead and jump into the makeup
tutorial so of course I'm just going to
start out with my brows and for that I'm
using the Anastasia brow powder this
stuff is incredible when my favorite
powders ever so I don't my brows to me
too harsh today so I just went in and
define them a little bit and made them a
little longer
nothing truth dramatic and then I'm
going in with the heart shape tape can
see like this one is incredible I and
obsessed with the shape tape so with
this I'm just going to define at my
brows underneath to make them a little
bit cleaner just to cover those little
bumps left hand cuts it underneath a
eyebrow now it's time for the eye shadow
so I'm teaching this Smashbox eyeshadow
to it and I'm picking up a medium cool
turn brown and just popping this
straight in the crease with a really big
fluffy brush from outer corner to inner
corner you guys know the drill so I'm
also going to take a smaller blending
brush and blend out the edges so there's
no harsh lines at all and then we're
going to go in with a warmer Brown and
I'm just gonna deepen up the crease a
little bit so just pack it on the outer
half and then bring it in the crease as
well we're not going to take it too high
so if the last color I'm going to take
is this nice rich chocolate brown and
again this is going in the same spot as
that last color to really deepen it up
and add some definition these colors oh
my god
so pigmented I love this palette okay so
let's go in and cut the crease so I'm
using that same tape shape concealer on
a really small brush and going to cut
that crease honey it sort of being
really careful with this because you
don't want to mess it up you want the
line to be as neat as you possibly can
make it this takes a little bit but it's
so worth it because cut creases up
turning they're just filling in at the
and a half of my eye with concealer and
then I'm going in with this a white
matte shade from the same palette and
I'm just going to pack that right over
the top and don't forget to go in and
blend the two colors together so there's
a nice gradient so for that I just took
this little fluffy brush and gently
brushed it over with the brown color we
are next up is to add some glitter glue
this one is from a two-faced but this
one's really really good so I'm just
going to pack a little bit right in the
middle of my eyelid and then I'm going
to take some glitter this one's from
glitter injections it's just like
silvery Goldy flakes really pretty just
go please like get them in your eyeball
seriously I don't know if that's safe
for your eyes actually no I know it's
not safe your eyes because you should
get it in your eye you can be blind I'm
just going to pass this right in the
middle and then we can move on to the
face so I'm using the vitamin-enriched
base base by Bobbi Brown this just
really hydrates my skin and it allows
the foundation to blend really smoothly
on top so I love this yet next I'm going
to use the grow long go long I'm not
sure what this is but I have gold flakes
in it it is a primer so as we excited to
try this it was pretty expensive and I
really didn't like it it smells amazing
it's not so expensive but it did leave
little gold flakes on my face like oh
cause it says girls like in there but
you're leaving on your face so I had to
flick it off my the point pretty nice
what we want to foundation I'm taking
this one a trauma clinic because my
friend recommended it the weird thing
about it is likely not much comes up
onto the little applicator it doesn't
mind me of the tape shape applicator
looks like really big I kind of like it
dip it in pop it on your face you're
ready to go so just blending that in
with my kabuki brush from zoeva this is
amazing for blending up our nation on
the face so I was really happy with the
coverage on this foundation it was
really nice I like the color of it I
will leave all of the color shades of
the lower lash down below if you need
any of that information so let's move on
to the concealer so I'm just going to
paint this under my eyes in an upside
down a triangle just to get rid of any
discoloration that we may have under
there and to brighten it up as well to
make myself look really awake happy I'm
also going to put that down the center
of my face to brighten that area up as
well so we can really proportion out
what's going on I don't my face to look
flat at all so I do clean up the edges
of my eye shadow as well with a Beauty
Blender I just lightly Pat over the
edges so it's not like coming down to
more you know
okay so let's move on to the translucent
powder i am using of course the same one
from Laura Mercier I'm just going to
pack backpack up down right there honey
when I say a higher power oh my god okay
so let's move on to powder I'm using
this one from benefit this is the hello
flawless I literally use this in every
video I love it so much it just adds so
much coverage and it makes the face
completely matte like what more could
you want now just going back in with
that chocolate brown shade and I'm just
going to tool wipe that from adequate in
a corner on a little pencil brush to
proportion out the eyeshadow then to
match it up with the top lid I'm going
to take that glitter again and just pack
a little bit right in the middle of my
lower lash line I think it looks cute so
now for mascara I'm taking this one from
the farm this has been my favorite
mascara for so long now and I need to
buy a new one because app but it's
really wet so it makes your lashes
really dramatic they're absolutely so
now for the lashes I'm taking these ones
from Tarte they were a little bit hard
to put on because the band is so stiff
so make sure you do like curve it around
so you know it goes on properly but
anyways let's move on to contouring I'm
taking this one from sleek and I'm just
going to pop this right underneath my
cheekbones carve them out a little bit
and actually do have very defined sheet
burns like can't go too crazy with this
otherwise it was super muddy really
quickly so I'm also going to contour my
nose as well I didn't really know what I
was doing I was just chuck in some dark
shades down the side of my nose hoping
it would look different and they're just
experimenting a little bit so now let's
move on to a parantha this one from Mac
it's actually a different shade to my
mask give me Stan I just thought hey I
need to try something different cause I
always use that one so this one is
really really nice not as orange as give
me Sun and I kind of liked it so on my
cheekbones jawbone and also around my
temples as well so they can really give
that Sun know what am I trying to say
give my face a sunkissed glow
now it's time for the blush I'm taking
this one from Tarte it's a really pretty
like everyday dusty rosy color so with
the same bronzing brush I'm just going
to put this on the apples of my cheeks
to blend it back just for a nice you
know color to the cheeks to make it look
nice and healthy and then I'm going to
take that same action
chatter and just baked underneath my
contour to make it nice and sharp and
define I love this part it's so
satisfying to watch let's move on to
highlight so I'm using this one from at
sleek and I'm just aligning you guys
honestly look at that absolutely
stunning and using my favorite
highlighter brush from a nostalgia you
get the a 23 like honestly that's how
good I am I have the worst memory but
I'm Neruda fresh because it's amazing so
I'm just going to get rid of that bacod
under there and would you look at that
standing so now let's move onto the lips
I'm using this Too Faced perfect lips
lip liner and I'm just gonna you know go
into my lips to make them look bigger
make them look juicy are just to fine
them a little bit then for the lipstick
I'm taking this on a farm at Rimmel
London it is a beautiful nude shade
which honestly goes with any makeup book
that you ever do this ones are really
creamy and pigmented and at last quickly
a long time as well so I just wanted to
show you a nude option because not
everyone likes to do a really intense
dark lip and need to look beautiful all
the time so you can never lose yeah make
