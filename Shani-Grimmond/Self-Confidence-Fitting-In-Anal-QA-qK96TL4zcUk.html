my channel so in today's video I'm going
to be doing aq a I haven't done one of
these in the longest time and I am super
excited so let's go ahead and jump
straight into it what is one thing you
want to do but you're afraid to do there
is honestly so many opportunities this
makes me so mad even thinking about it I
get so many emails of like amazing
opportunities to do fun things like do
interviews and like all of this stuff
and I always turn them down because I am
so afraid like I'm so afraid of so many
things I even went to a psychic and I
like you need to stop being afraid you
have so many opportunities coming your
way you have so many things that you
could be doing but you're not doing it
because you're afraid and it's just like
there's so much fear inside of me and
it's just like it honestly stops me from
doing so much it makes me so incredibly
upset like for example the other day I
got an email from like a massive news
channel and they wanted me to be on the
news and like talk about how been
growing and how successful I am at such
a young age and that's something I
should be proud to talk about what I'm
fucking so scared just is like go on
like the news or do things that are
really big and scary like I get so
afraid to the point where I'm like I'm
not going to do that and it's so bad and
I need to learn to just get past that
but I don't know it sucks honestly what
made you start YouTube I feel like I'm
answered this question a lot but now
that I think of it I feel like my answer
has changed a little bit so I think the
main reason I started YouTube was
because I didn't fit in where I lived
like I honestly didn't fit in people
where I live like where I grew up that
was so different to me and I don't want
to sound like a bitch but I feel like I
was just in the wrong city like I love
fashion I love beauty I love all of that
high-class stuff and I was just in the
wrong City and I didn't fit in with
other people so I thought why not do
like YouTube channel and actually talk
about things that I love and who cares
about trying to fit in with other people
that's what I'm going to do on the
weekend so that's what I did and now
I've moved to a different city that I
love and then I fit into and I love it
so much I feel like I found myself and
oh my god that fellow this is like
getting emotional but I finally have
found myself and I've found friends that
actually do fit to my standards in life
like we have more things in common
stuffin it's honestly amazing and I
think that's just what laughs about it's
just about finding yourself and YouTube
has been a massive massive massive part
of that and I'm so fucking grateful like
forever grateful and I'm so happy and
I've never been as happy in my life and
it's literally only because of you guys
like the support that I get from you
guys that's where my happiness comes
from the next question is what are your
plans for the future and it honestly
makes me so incredibly happy because
there's actually something I can say now
because I have planned something for the
future and I can't really say what it is
all I can say is I've got something
really exciting coming up and I honestly
can't wait to share with you guys and
it's gonna be soon it's gonna be this
year okay that's all I can say what is
your favorite childhood memory ah well I
think the best thing is just like
thinking back and being like I had no
worries mom used to make me dinner at
night dad used to tuck me in and there
was actually nothing you have to worry
about and like you play with your toys
you just be like genuine genuinely like
really fucking happy that's how I am now
like I'm sorry happy but you put like do
shit for yourself you gotta like clean
up after yourself but when you're a
child it's just like life is so easy and
I remember I would always want to be
like I can't wait till maintain I can't
wait till older but no you just got to
enjoy being as young as you are because
it's amazing and yeah yeah oh my god
I've seen so many of these questions it
is what has happened between you and
Chloe so if you guys don't know Chloe is
she's my best friend I've been best
friends with her for so long like ever
since I was grade five and we've just
always been super super close but our
friendship is like we'll hang out for
like six months straight and be
completely inseparable and then for
about five months we just won't really
speak at all we weren't really hang out
much but we'll always come back to being
that really really close friend with
that amazing bond that no one else can
really like oh no one else can really
like connect with us it's just like us
too and that's all I'm sure you guys
have friends like that as well but at
the moment I just I guess Chloe and I
are in two separate places and I'm
filming all the time like I'm filming
every single Daniel E and she's in
Melbourne a lot and I don't know we just
don't hang out as much and I feel like
if you really wanted to spend time with
someone you would make time for someone
but we're not at the end of the day you
oh this and I know this if you wanted to
make time for someone you would
obviously we do have spare time that we
could be hanging out but we don't but it
doesn't mean that you don't love each
other as much as we do like I love
clothes so much I've never loved a
friend as much as I love her that's just
how we are
it's really weird the next question is
actually a really interesting one it is
did your parents let you date when you
were 13 years old so when I was 13 like
in like just studying high school and
grade seven and stuff I had boyfriends
and there was nothing for my parents to
worry about because I didn't even talk
to them I was so scared
but there would be this label they don't
have this boyfriend but we would hug in
the afternoon they'd bring me my bag
after school like that's all it was so
there's no point of me really even
telling my parents about it because it
was nothing at all except a label um I
do remember the time I told my mom I
lost my virginity though that was scary
um I wasn't 13 I was I think like two
weeks off sixteen so I was 15 years old
and I was like mom I think I'm ready to
lose my virginity and she's like my
fucking god oh my god you're so young
and I was like no I just think I'm ready
like I'm with my boyfriend I love hand
bla bla and she was like well if you're
ready then you can go ahead and do it I
mean I'm not gonna stop you it's your
life and literally I had already lost my
virginity like a week before that and I
was just telling her like I think I'm
ready so I could like wore up to it my
mom still doesn't know this like hey
mommy if you're watching love you know
yeah that's the only time I can think of
them being strict they were pretty
laid-back when I was growing up because
I knew I was smart then you would make
good decisions and stuff because I was I
was an angel child I still am I never
fuckin do anything bad so not a to
marine or anything but I'm I don't do
stupid things no sometime what is the
most valuable thing in your house
answering this question honestly just
makes me think about the break-in like
if I was to be like oh I've got a twenty
thousand dollar vials in my house I feel
like someone just break into my house
like I went to the psychic probably six
months ago and she's like I feel fear
and I'm like what and she's like I feel
like he's still not over the break-in
and I was like well how can you get over
something like that like you can't just
get over it like it's been a year or
something now nearly a year and I'm not
sad about it but how can you get over
something like that so like when someone
asks a question like that I'm like hmm
it just like takes me back to that time
we're all so fucking mad but as I said
to you guys in the breaking videos that
I did explaining everything I will leave
a link down below if you guys want to
see it cuz it's pretty fuckin
interesting I I'm actually glad that
that did happen because I wouldn't be
where I am without that happening I
wouldn't be living in Brisbane without
that happening and I'm so grateful for
it
which is weird to say but someone
commented a question on my photo and
said anal question mark really the next
question is what is your actual name a
lot of people don't know my actual name
it is Kashani so ka sha and I I don't
even know where it's from I don't know
where my parents got it from but I
really like it there any reason I don't
like people call me cuz Shani is my
parents call me that when they were
angry at me when I was a teeny-tiny
child so now every time someone says
Kashani I'm like no you're angry at me
don't call me that okay fucking hate it
I don't know I keep swearing in this
video I don't know why some days I'm
just like super sweary some days I'm not
what can you do the next question is how
have you become more self-confident and
I feel like this question ties in with
something else talking about before and
it all comes down to who you surround
yourself by how how your family treats
you and how supportive they are and
hobbies and stuff like finding things
that you love because obviously
obviously that's gonna make you more
happy and being happy is going to make
you more confident so your friends I
think makes such a big impact so if you
guys have people in your life that are
putting you down or making you feel like
shit or aren't supporting why are they
your friends you shouldn't have people
like that in your life I've had so many
friends in my past that just weren't
right for me and you just have to let
them go because if they're not right for
you they're not doing any benefits in
your life then don't even bother being
friends with them because honestly a
waste of time you have to be around
people that just make you a better you
the next question is what do your
parents think about you on your
boyfriend's age gap don't be offended I
love you I love you too I'm like that
doesn't make me feel weird or anything
at all like Jonathan is I think five
years older than me when we first
started dating
literally I had no fucking idea he was
five years older than me I thought it
was like three years older than me and
like five or something days of us like
hanging out in a row he said like his
birthday it was like 1992 or something
and I was like you're five years older
than me like what the hell and at this
point we had already like had a clique
we already like had chemistry so I was
like oh well I'm not gonna let that get
in the way my parents have never said
anything about the age gap I guess just
because I'm mature and he's a chihuahua
it's like what's the problem nothing the
next question is what is one thing you
feel insecure about yourself one thing
that you're insecure about no I'm not
insecure about anything I have learnt to
like love every piece of me even though
there are things on my body I would love
to tweak and change and make look better
I still have learned to love every part
of myself and I think that's so
incredibly important but I wouldn't say
that I have any insecurities so that we
have in my QA guys I really hope you've
enjoyed it if you did please give it a
big thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
