my life if you guys didn't see watch my
last vlog and you'll see what John did
for my birthday
it was also his birthday as well but
he's doing it without for mine thank you
someone said I feel like you don't you
don't have to miss this but it says when
you and Sean you broke up what were you
feeling what I'm feeling
yeah like Jane when we're breaking up
oh no just took a while to get over but
you just got to try not to think about
it yeah like I'm lucky I had my friends
and stuff around well start with my best
friends overseas for like oh no he
wasn't overseas he was done like Sydney
for like six weeks or something straight
and so but at the time like he was the
main person I even like hung around with
which is it be funny and then when he
got back and stuff after that but like
we were just hanging the whole time
understand yeah and doing stuff her like
I never did like I didn't do stuff that
regularly but then like I started to all
the time and then you start like she
basically is doing that like your
friends yeah you just got a big get it
out there in this not sit on because
when you sit around and when you think
about it fine not fine fine that one
fine so many my friends like now don't
even realize it's my birthday
like yesterday because I did like a post
for SHINee so they're like yeah cool say
happy birthday too shiny for you for me
and it's like ladies don't like everyone
just knows it's Charlie's birthday
[Laughter]
though it's sad no it's not a big thing
to me like only the most important
people care so yeah it's fun wait you've
gone huh what was it would you say yes
if John proposed you Thanks
how much change since of we'll go back
together thing like to start with it
kind of like it felt like a lot had
changed I feel like to each other we get
I just thought it was like a little bit
one side of where I was always putting
the effort that was definitely what was
different yeah had a big got on yeah so
I was always the one like asking to hang
out or if you need help with like
whatever was doing and it was very
one-sided and I was like holy how
awful but I kept wanting this and now
we're kind of like back to it used to be
yeah is that bad in a good way yeah in
the news better way yeah in the best way
if we had kids together how many kids
would you want and what would their
names be right now if you could choose I
would want definitely true well yeah I'd
want a boy and a girl but obviously
countries I'd be happy with two girls I
would be happy with your boys oh each
other back up by the way I was standing
at the door before scratching my boobs
cuz I like I have to scratch underneath
my boobs here to get the feeling back
cuz I can't feel anything and um I would
grave read the door and this guy's just
like well he's ready to come in till I
get rid of the mosquitoes but I just
thought I'd say that cuz I drove the
door and I'm like oh what's in the good
old scratch yeah I was actually like
yeah I was like oh my god that's so
quick what was the question what would
names mean I don't know what I'd name
him I'm not into that stuff like I
literally it would take me so long to
like name my kids like I had to ask my
Instagram followers what to name my dogs
like not the dogs and kids did yeah true
things but like literally I just I'm
sorry about with names but I would make
it something very unique I wouldn't make
it something like yes I'm John Oh lack
oh yeah or how you like my sister like
I'm just not into that I want to make it
weird like I love um Tami's kids names
yeah I want something weird
I completely agree is John gonna propose
on your birthday boat hell no I'm I'm
having fun
everyone's asking how do I feel about
your boob job do you like them yeah of
course I like it and I like it was just
something that Sean had spoken about for
like the whole time had always been
together
my she always had insecurities and I
think like people would point them out
even more through social media as well
no one through social media it was kind
of someone
personal I know about people would you
sick I comment about the lines and stuff
as well
only in one photo someone will you
decide to me quite a few times yeah like
I would always like I didn't like my
groups like by the end of it yeah um but
those is one photo that I posted and
they looked really squished and like
saggy because I was wearing one piece no
pushing him down and then all these
people commenting saying like I'm gonna
go I'll you have a Squidward know his
tits now so that was the first time
people said something about my boobs
because usually they were like fine
because when I wasn't that cool my boobs
were kind of like like really good but I
still would always like mention like oh
I'm not getting a job one day because I
kind of knew they wouldn't say big
forever but then like when I went off
the pill like literally as soon as we
broke up I went off the pill and my
boobs like deflate it and went so small
so like when I got the boob job I he
didn't really know about it do you yeah
I knew about I mean you're getting
because you like we were speaking the
whole time but like I don't judge people
for what they do like people can do
whatever they want to say anything what
I told you so yeah that is all for this
video
do you have anything else you like to
say oh you're good no that's all my
questions answered Thanks we finished
our wine well well we've actually gonna
go home like in an hour so I've gotta go
