so in today's video I'm just going to be
doing a makeup tutorial I think I want
to do a silver smoky cut crease I look
with a nude lip so that's what I have in
mind because I haven't done one of those
in so long so let's go ahead and jump
into the video as per usual I'm going to
start out with my mac prolongwear
concealer in the shade NC 20 I've been
using this for the longest time now for
an eye primer and it works so well so
I'm just putting a little bit on the
back of my hand and putting this all
over my eyelids why this is better than
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot in my
opinion I used to love that so much I
never use anything else until I
discovered this now just going over that
with my Beauty Blender to pick up any
excess concealer I've already filled in
my brows with the Mac what's good it is
C a Mac true brunette fluidline brow
cream when you prime your eyes always
remember to set it down with a pressed
powder so all of the colors blend out on
top
easily otherwise it is going to get
stuck to the concealer because it is
super tacky now it's time to be
eyeshadow so I'm going in with my huda
beauty textured eyeshadow palette B rose
gold edition assist sorry pretty look at
all of the colors I'm sure you guys have
seen is floating around on the internet
for a while but the first color that I'm
going to take is sandalwood justice
medium brown tone and this is going in
my crease with a fluffy brush I'm just
going to take it in little circular
motions that these shows are very
pigmented I'm just going to take a
bigger fluffy brush to blend out the
edges so we can keep it nice and soft
I'm just putting a little tiny bit of
pressure on there soften it out a tiny
bit now for the next shade I'm going in
with this one right here and this is
going closer to the crease so we're just
going to add some cool turns in this
looks much the silver so I'm not going
to bring this one up as high now going
back in with that Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and I'm using this to carve
out my crease and the brush that I'm
using is just a winged liner brush I'm
just going to start from me in a corner
and carve her out well I haven't really
hooded eye so I love doing hot creases
because I can bring them up higher and
it makes them look bigger and then
taking a little concealer brush I'm just
going to put this all over my lid and
this is going to be where I put the
silver shadow I'm just going to set that
concealer down just a little bit with a
pressed powder I just thought it's not
too tacky and then I'm going in with
this glitter from at glitter injections
it is just a very very pigmented silver
as we can see right there and I'm just
going to use this little brush to put it
all over my eyelid I'm using a synthetic
brush so a lot of color consoles I have
a feeling that this next step might ruin
the whole entire look but I'm willing to
do that because I feel like the crease
is way too light
I definitely want some black up there so
I'm going to go in with this black
eyeshadow okay with this black eyeshadow
on a little tiny brush and I'm just
going to like buff this into my crease
wish me luck honestly
now let's move on to the state so I'm
going to use the Rimmel lasting finish
primer this is a skin protect a skin
perfecting primer so it's going to
ensure the makeup will stay on longer
and it's also going this still is at my
little pause as well so I'm going to use
a brush to apply this just because I do
have glitter all over my fingers in my
face but hopefully the photo should
cover this clip now let's move on to
foundation so I can match my neck to my
face so I'm going to take the Remora
lasting finish skin perfecting medium
coverage foundation I'm going to mix two
shades so we have the shade three a
three and two or three I'm not too sure
what chains good in mind so just going
to mix them together I'm just going to
apply this with a stippling brush my
gullet is literally a perfect match
between it and I'm just going to pop
this into my face this foundation has a
really good coverage now it's time for
can see a lot to get rid of these at
bags under my eyes so I'm going to go in
with the Becca a cool luminous
perfecting concealer and I have the
shade at fair so I'm just going to go
directly under my eyes I love the
applicator on this it's really fluffy
and you know what to do I'm just gonna
lend out this with my trusty beauty
butter and then to bake under my eyes
I'm using the makeups - you're in
professional makeup translucent powder
in extra fine I'm just going to put a
little bit in the lid and go in and bake
I try to use like banana shade under my
eyes but it still creases no matter what
I do so this is the best way for me
now to set the rest of my face I'm going
in with the Australian flawless pressed
powder in the shade medium cancer I'm
just using a kabuki brush and going in
on a little bit more coverage and go to
make sure my face doesn't look holy at
all time for the lower lash line I'm
going to start with this shade right
here and this is going to go from outer
corner to inner corner so we kind of
mirror really close to my eyeballs so I
can really see what's happening I'm just
applying it where they're a little tiny
pencil brush looking up and absolutely
gassing with my little lash line
then going in with the black from that
same palette I'm going to focus this on
the outer half really close to the
lashes someone's pulling me through who
it is I'm declining you by now so
mascara I'm going in with my Urban Decay
perversion mascara and I'm just putting
this on the floor forces so we can make
them nice and black for my lashes I'm
just going to apply these a really thin
one because I want the silver to show
through when I'm opening my eyes and I
always do thick lashes anyway so I want
to trade it up a bit I've let my glue
get really tacky so I'm just going to
put a little bit on the lash band
looking down into my little mirror and
I'm going to stick it as close as I can
to my lash line let's go ahead and upper
arms up my face so I'm going to start by
taking my Bobbi Brown rosing powder in
the shade at medium - just on a little
round brush and we could have put this
onto my cheekbones do I like bumhole it
I'm just putting a a little bit over
here because my jeepers I've actually
really defined so if I go the smallest
little bit overboard it looks ridiculous
and now I'm going in with my Marc Jacobs
1:02 Ted trick Omega bronzer this is the
biggest browser of all time
so let's warm up the face a little bit
shall we just putting it on my
cheekbones and I'm also going to put it
around my tables as well so my hairline
I'm going to do a little bit of baking
under my contour brush bit close over it
down really fast my bad I'm really going
to leave that on for about five seconds
and then we're going to go in and it
away otherwise it's going to be too
harsh it's obviously just some that
translucent powders that work for baking
because some I like really intensively
the white strip and others are fine okay
okay so I'm just going to go in with a
little bit more bronzer and a blender
liner a tiny bit for a bit of color on
the cheeks I'm taking this NARS blush in
the shade
last dive is a beautiful shimmery coral
blush and I'm just going to start
working this on the apples of my cheeks
and uploading it back this matches so
many different makeup looks and it is
slowly luminous now we just make up the
highlighter in the shade a little this
one is a jerk worm I'm just going to
highlight my face with it this one is a
really light so it's going to be intense
oh yeah oh yeah this one kind of has
like a purple reflect to it I think I
can't figure it out yeah I think so
with a pinky purple a little bit on my
nose I'm so usual now it's time for the
ellipse so I'm taking the Ribble London
provoke ellipse tear through the lip
color and I have a shade 700 I've let
this sit for about 1 minute so now let's
go in with the other side to make it
nice and glossy last but not least I'm
going in with the touch are luminous
Jewish skin with let's do this
I feel like nothing hums oh oh okay so
I'm gonna go fix my hair and put some
jewelry on and I'll be right back okay
