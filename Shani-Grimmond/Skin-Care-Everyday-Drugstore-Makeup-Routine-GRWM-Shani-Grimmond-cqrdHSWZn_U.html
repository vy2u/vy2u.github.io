romancing hey guys it's Shawnie and
welcome back to my channel so in today's
video i'm doing my morning skincare
routine following up with a everyday
makeup look so it let's jump straight
into it i'm going to start with
cleansing my face you want to make sure
you get all of that sweat and dirt out
of your skin before you apply a makeup
for the day because even when you sleep
you've got a lot of sweat build up so
I'm using my trusty a vanity planet Skin
Spa I absolutely love this if you guys
did see my last skin care routine I did
use this and that was months months ago
and I've still been using it every
single morning and night so the reason I
do this everyday is because it removes
dry dead skin cells from the surface of
the skin and that is going to keep the
pores from clogging so it's going to
prevent breakouts blemishes blackheads
whiteheads all of that stuff that you
really don't want so my skin has been
glowing from within and that's where you
want to start before you apply your
makeup you want the base to be perfect I
just place this on my face to let the
brush do the work and I usually do it
for about one minute I just take it in
circular motions and it really gets the
blood flowing around the face it
honestly feels like a face and massage
it's incredible so this comes with three
separate brush heads I personally like
to use the silicone brush just because I
do have really dry skin I don't want to
over exfoliate my skin because it is
quite sensitive but the other one is the
daily cleansing facial brush and also
the exfoliating facial brush but I just
like to stick to the silicone one
because it works perfectly for my skin
so are you ready for the discount code
because it is massive so if you use the
discount code at shiny skin or click the
link in the description box below we can
purchase it you will get a 70% off
discount code so instead of spending 125
dollars you can get it for 38 now that
is what I'm talking about
and then going in with the j-league
activating water essence so this helps
the skin stay nice and hydrated and also
improves the skin's ability to retain
moisture so as I said before my skin is
pretty dry so this stuff is beautiful it
smells really good as well
then it's time to go in and mooster eyes
the whole face I'm using the Kiehl's
moisturizer this stuff is incredible I
love it so much this is my second tub of
it it just makes my face so incredibly
hydrated and just makes it so glowy and
then of course I'm going to go ahead and
moisturize my eyes so this is the
horrible eye cream I will list
everything that I'm using in the
description below but I don't want any
wrinkles so let's dab dab dab really
lightly and moisturize that last but not
least I'm going in with the rosewater
mist from joe leek love this brand so
much this is just really refreshing on
the face feels beautiful and then last
but not least let's pop a bit of lip
balm on so we can get started with the
makeup starting off with the NYX angel
veil primer I really like this one
because it's super affordable it makes
the skin feel so incredibly smooth and
you want your makeup to stay on all day
am i right now for foundation I'm taking
the L'Oreal infallible
24 hour matte foundation I will never
understand why foundations claim to last
24 hours because who in their right mind
is going to leave their makeup on for 24
hours that would be so disgusting this
foundation has a really nice medium to
full coverage it doesn't feel cakey at
all I love the shade that I have it
matches really really well to my fake
tan now for the brows I'm going in with
the NYX brow gel I've used this once so
far so good I will keep you guys updated
but I really like to just make my brows
more defined I have really straight
brows so I like to you know make a
little arch fill them in a bit now it's
time to carve them out to add a bit more
shape make them up here a bit more clean
so I'm going in with the Maybelline fit
me concealer one of my favorite
concealers ever and we're just going to
sharpen that up a tiny bit then we're
going to go ahead and prime the eyelids
just to get rid of any veins and to make
sure any eyeshadow that is put on over
the top really sticks and is super
vibrant now going in with the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer I'm just going to
pop this in my crease just to add a
little bit of definition nothing
overpowering at all you can honestly use
any bronzer for this it pretty much all
looks the same
as long as it's matte it's just going to
make the crease look a bit more
there because like I don't really have a
crease so now going in with the savvy
brow gel this one's clear I'm just going
to quickly wrap this in my brows to make
sure they are stuck down the whole day
girl now it's time to go in and conceal
just to get rid of any of those purple
areas under the eyes and I'm also going
to highlight the center of my face as
well so just going in with a Beauty
Blender just a dab dab jab I feel like
I've got a bubble in my throat my voice
just sounds really weird Deborah there
we go
now taking the airspun loose face powder
I'm just going to use this to bake under
my eyes and then with whatever's left in
the lid I'm just going to dust set on
the rest of my face now going back in
with that same bronzer that I put in the
crease I'm using this to contour but I'm
going to use kind of a fluffier brush
just so it diffuses out a little bit so
it's not as harsh since it kind of is
like an everyday a quick look so just
under my cheekbones around my forehead
and then I'm gonna go in with this
Milani baked blush to add some warmth
some shimmer just some girl ooh next
step is to bake under the bronzer I only
do this sometimes if I feel like my
bronzer got a bit messy or went down too
low this just makes it super sharp and
clean now for blush I'm taking this Wet
Wild mega glue just to add a bit more
color to the cheek so I'm just going to
lightly dust that on the apples and then
blend it back for mascara I'm taking the
L'Oreal telescopic extra black this is
my Holy Grail mascara even out of any
high-end product this is honestly
incredible like what the actual chicken
wings I'm just going to put this on my
top and bottom lashes and they get a bit
so beautiful and just so long now taking
this NYX retractable lip pencil in the
shade natural I love this so much oh my
god you guys should definitely get it if
you need just like an everyday nude lip
liner so creamy and so easy to apply now
for the lippy stick I'm taking this one
from a color pop just popping that all
over and then going back in with the lip
liner to darken it up just a tiny bit
then going in with my NYX butter gloss
this is so affordable and so beautiful
I'm just going to put this all over my
lips just for a little bit of a glow and
I cannot believe I almost freakin forgot
highlighter I'm taking this one by
Physicians Formula this is my first time
using it and oh my god
what like whoa I'm obsessed it's
stunning I'm just putting this in the
normal areas so on top of my cheekbones
on my nose on top my Cupid's bow and
also above my eyebrows because I love a
glow everywhere this highlighter looks
so good on the tip of the nose as well
it made me look like I had a little
button nose I'm also going to add this
on the inner corners to finish off the
eye shadow and last but not least I'm
going to finish off this makeup look
with the Maybelline master fix this is
just going to ensure the makeup stays on
all day long and then we are finished so
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did it please give it a big
thumbs up I love you I love you love you
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
