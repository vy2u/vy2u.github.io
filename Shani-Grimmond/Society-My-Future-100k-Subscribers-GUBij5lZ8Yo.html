so today's video is going to be
completely random it's just going to be
an update on my life I'll be telling you
guys what's been happening this week
because I have not been posting videos a
lot of people have been getting really
upset because I haven't been posting
videos in the last 6 days but I have
been super busy and I'm going to be
telling you what has been going on in
last week and also I'll be answering
some questions that I asked you guys to
ask me on Instagram so this video is
more of a personal video if you guys
don't want to get to know me or anything
you can just go ahead and watch a beauty
video that I've uploaded and I'll also
have some new Beauty videos up very very
soon so yeah just stay tuned for that
and let's jump into the video okay so
the first thing I want to talk about is
my subscribers because that is just the
most exciting thing of my life I hit
100,000 subscribers last week I was so
excited like you would not even believe
my reaction I was jumping off the walls
bouncing off the walls I was so happy
and I'm still so happy thank you guys so
much for subscribing to me it honestly
means the world to me I wouldn't be here
without you as cliche as that sounds but
I just want to let you guys know how
much you mean to me and all the comments
that you guys leave it just makes my day
like I honestly can't even deal so yeah
I just want to say thank you so much you
guys mean the world to me you've made me
so so happy I just love making YouTube
videos and sitting here talking to you
guys reading your comments I do want to
do a giveaway very soon for what you
have all done for me I want to give away
like a whole bunch of stuff so it's stay
tuned for that and the next thing that I
want to pick up a below the next thing
that I want to update you guys on is
I've got my license which is so exciting
like that was nearly as exciting and
city 100k getting my license has been
the best thing that has happened to me
for so long I can finally just leave
when I want to I can go to school and
drive myself and not be late because my
mom likes to take a time when I'm
getting ready yeah so yeah I could
definitely say that I'm at the happiest
point of my life right now
having my license having the most
amazing viewers on YouTube having so
much support from people my life is just
so great right now and if any of you
guys are going for your license and you
nervous I know the feeling because I was
so nervous before my test because I
thought I was going to fail because I
just didn't really have that much
confidence but I practice a lot like I I
just was driving a lot trust me a lot
okay so let's put that happy stuff to
the side and move on to something a
little bit more personal because I just
want to open up to you guys and let you
guys in on what's happening so yesterday
I was called intimidating disrespectful
and I think I think that I'm too good
for other people so I just want to
quickly talk about that because yes just
don't like it okay so I wasn't told this
by some anonymous on tumblr like I
always get hate on tumblr and I don't
sleep don't mind because I just feel
sorry for the person that whatever
they're feeling inside they're probably
just taking me out on me because they're
having a bad time kind of thing so
tumblr hate you know it's horrible but
it happens all the time you can't do
anything about it but I got called
all these names kind of thing from
someone that I see every day basically
okay so the one thing that I hate about
society is that a lot of people judge
others for the way that they look by the
way that they dress the way they speak
and just in general the way that they
present themselves now I don't think
anyone should ever be told that they are
less than what they are everyone should
be happy with himself and 2-bit to get
put down for being happy with your own
body is honestly one of the most hurtful
things that could ever happen to me I'm
really confident and to get put down for
being confident is really hurtful saying
that I'm intimidating fine but saying
that I think I'm better than other
people because of the way I present
myself the way I look is really really
hurtful I do not look down on people I
see people the way that they see me like
I respect everyone I I just don't
understand how I could be intimidating
we're almost same level here so I don't
see why people have to pinpoint me so if
you guys are confident then I'm so happy
to hear that because that is one of the
most important things in life just being
happy with yourself being happy with
your body and everything
I know it is really hard to be like that
in today's society so the other thing is
me being disrespectful I am never
disrespectful to anyone I respect
everyone I treat other people how they
treat me
so yeah I just want to get that out of
the way now let's move on to the
question and answer part of this video
so I asked a few people well I asked my
Instagram to leave some messages on my
photo so yeah I haven't read any of them
but I'm going to see what people have
said this is going to be interesting
what is one thing you're excited about
for when you leave school I'm excited to
just sit down and film videos and just
go ahead with all of these exciting
things that life is offering me right
now I've been offered like a few
modeling things and being a part of all
these crazy things that I will talk
about in the future but yeah I'm just
excited to be independent and move out
and just keep going with my youtube
because it makes me so happy and I just
love you guys so much Daniel Evans asks
what is your favorite thing to do when
I'm with my friends I just love is
sitting today with my friends and just
talking about life talking about
personal things because I don't know
it's like that's so much more fun than
going out shopping or watching a movie
or something I just love sitting down
with them in heaven a good old
heart-to-heart chat so the next question
is when you want to travel outside
Australia now I want to travel to Sydney
which is in Australia but if I was to
travel outside of Australia it would be
like the whole world basically so the UK
the US Canada China like I just want to
grow everywhere I just want to travel
the rest of my life next question is
what is your advice on starting a
YouTube channel I have a lot of advice
to people for starting a channel I have
a lot of useful tips that I could share
with you guys but I do want to make a
dedicated video on that so if you guys
are interested just leave a comment in
the comments below and give this video a
thumbs up and I will absolutely make a
full video about that the main things
would definitely be though having a good
quality camera good lights and also just
good ideas for uploading videos like
make sure you have a variety of
different videos not just to make up not
just fashion you know just make a big
variety and sorry for that screaming
next question is how do you stay
so happy and positive I'm not happy all
the time obviously I only film when I'm
very happy because I don't want to give
other people a negative vibe so
obviously I only film when I'm like in a
pretty good mood and in order of staying
negative a murmur in order of staying
positive that's just who I am
I look at the bright side of things and
I guess it is kind of hard sometimes to
look at the bright side of things but
everything happens for a reason so you
kind of have to look at it like that I
mean everything works out in the end
anyway so that's just how I like to
think of it next question is am I still
dating my boyfriend and yes means Shawn
are still dating we have been dating for
nearly two years now which is really
exciting
and I just love him so much and I do
have two videos with him if you guys
want to see it
I just don't post as many photos with
him anymore because I don't know why I
don't post photos with him I don't know
how do you buy all the clothes that you
buy like what's your job I love your
videos by the way and thank you so okay
disclaimer sometimes when I do a video
I'll have it in the description box what
I got sent for free because I do get
sent things for free to promote I only
promote things that I would buy myself
obviously I wouldn't want to be disloyal
to you guys because I flop in love views
as I've said I think three times now so
yeah I get a lot of my things for free
and the things that I don't get for free
I just pay for out of the money that I
earn from working really hard so yeah
who is my favorite youtuber I get asked
this a lot so this is the first time
going to be answering it Britney Lee
Saunders is definitely my favorite
youtuber she is just so true to herself
she's so confident and I know I just
think she's really inspiring with what
she was doing with her life and stuff so
Britney Lee Saunders is definitely my
favorite uber and the next one is Shan
Xing she was so amazing at makeup and
she's just stunning
and of course Lauren Curtis is beautiful
and who else did I watch that's all I
can think of on the top of my head
that's just the main three and then non
beauty related would have to be Trisha
Paytas oh she cracked me up the next one
is if you could trade places with any
person who would it be and why and
be completely honest I would not change
who I am ever because I'm so happy with
where I'm at in my life I know there's
people out there that are rich and
famous and having the time of their
lives but I'm doing just fine with what
I'm doing at the moment I'm so happy if
I could change places with the person
for a day like that would be fun
you would have change into though I
probably change into like Justin Bieber
so I could just pull my pants down and
see what's going on next question is how
do you keep your teeth so white um I
will be doing a video about that very
soon so you guys can see everything that
I do to keep them nice and white and
also wearing red lipstick health makes
them look what why would you oh my god
that vacuum is so annoying thank you oh
my god
what's something you wish you could tell
yourself 1 or 2 years ago and there is
nothing that I would want to change
about my past I've learned from my past
I have grew from my past I'm happy with
how it all turned out what's your most
embarrassing story and I don't really
have too many embarrassing stories there
was one time I was camping I liked a
campsite and I went to the toilet
because you have to walk all the way to
the toilet from your tent and yeah I
went to the toilet and I came back and
everyone was staring at me was at
nighttime and I'm like what is everyone
staring at and I got back in my little
cousins like shy have something hanging
from your pants so I turned around I
have like a literally a humongous string
of tall paper hanging from my pants and
I was like oh this could not happen like
that was so embarrassing I feel like
I've been talking for so long so I'm
just going to go ahead and leave it at
that even though I have so many more
questions to answer but if you guys did
like this video
I can certainly go ahead and do some
more so if you have any requests on some
videos that you want to see make sure
leave in the comments below because I'm
on holidays now I can make hips nukes
videos and put them all up so yeah I'll
talk to you guys very soon
