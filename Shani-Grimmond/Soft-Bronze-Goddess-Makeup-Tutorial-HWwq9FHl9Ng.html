so in today's video I really want to do
a natural ish bronzy glow a kind of look
I'm always playing around with different
colors and products and stuff so every
now and then I like to go back to my
favorite look which is a really
beautiful bronzy look sir I really hope
you guys liked this video and let's go
ahead and jump right in the first
product I'm taking is this sports girl
Coco bronze this is a bronze in primer
so I'm just gonna pop this all over my
face this is like the first step to a
beautiful glowy look so we're gonna rub
this in with my fingers so it really
sinks into my skin I faked a my neck so
my face is always so much lighter and if
you're wondering why in my browser story
doc I got them tattooed on it yesterday
so I have to be really careful going
around my eyebrows right now I can't get
any product in there oh my god this
primer feels it's so nice it's like a
really nice silicone feel and my face is
nice and moisturized and ready to go now
I think I'm gonna do the face first just
because the eyes are gonna be really
natural anyway so I won't need to clean
up the edge or anything so let's move on
to your foundation I'm gonna take the
Tarte rainforest of the sea foundation
in the shade medium ten sand I used to
use this all the time I love it so much
a super light and it does provide like a
nice light to medium coverage but I do
like to build it up to a medium coverage
and I'm also gonna mix in this Coco
bronze that liquid face and body bronzer
this one's by Sportsgirl so I'm just
gonna put a few drops of this in the
back of my hand and then one drop of
this or you can kind of make it a bit
more bronzy and glowy I'm so excited for
this the top foundation is super liquidy
so you got to be careful
doesn't dribble off your hand up and
then just a little bit of this bullets
girl product oh it has a little shimmer
isn't it it's gonna be stunning okay so
I'm just gonna blend that in with make
the you do blender isn't it so
satisfying to watch someone put
foundation on to match the neck oh my
god these two products look so good
together so you can use the body and
face bronzer just on its own if you want
like a jewelry bronzy kind of look but I
always like to go at least
in coverage so this is what I'm gonna do
today I'm also just gonna put a little
bit of that Veron side down my neck as
well so I'm just gonna take a fan Dacian
brush go in just so they match up a bit
better now it's time for the concealer
so I'm taking this one from Bobbi Brown
this one's called the instant a full
cover concealer this one's in the shade
it's and this is a really nice color to
highlight so I'm just gonna pop this
under my eyes and also on my eyes I'm
gonna what I feel like this is empty
what are you doing
yeah also on my eyelid as well so we can
get rid of full darkness purple veins
can't blend it out with my Beauty
Blender I feel like because it's sorry
if you get some rehan to blend but okay
I'm impressed it's blending out nicely
thank goodness I can't believe how much
of a difference concealer makes like as
soon as you cover those dark circles you
know whole face just looks like 10 years
younger
okay I'd be concerned if I look ten but
you know what I mean to set that
concealer down I'm taking the lip
formula
I always top it up the Prarie cellulite
treatment a loose powder this is
literally the most expensive powder I
have and I really want to use it up
because I feel like I wasted my money
but it is really good at literally just
melts into the skin like no other powder
I've used before
it doesn't make under the eyes feel like
too tight or dry steady I'm also just
gonna set my eyelids as well and then to
set the rest of my face I'm going to
take my favorite powder as per usual D
benefit hello flawless in the shade
champagne I'm just gonna lightly dab
this all over my face just so everything
is set in place alright let's move on to
the eyeshadow sir I'm gonna take the
tartlet toasted palette I am so excited
to use this palette the colors in here
look so beautiful and perfect for a warm
bronzed you kind of look sorry the first
color that I'm gonna take
hmm those true colors that I'm really
looking at I'm gonna take the shade a
latte right here this is like a medium
brown and I'm just gonna blend this in
my crease with my Inglot 6ss brush this
is so good as a transition brush
oh my god that is so pigmented oh it's
funny really nicely as well oh my god
honestly this would have to be like one
of the most pigmented eyeshadows I've
used for a very long time
next I'm just gonna pick up this color
right here this is a lighter shade and
I'm just gonna use that to blend out
that Brown there because I did not
expect that you know I mean it's very
gently okay I need to turn my brightness
down the lip color that I'm gonna take
is in the shade sunset it is such a
pretty bronzy color right here there's
also this one here which is super nice
as well but oh no I feel like this one's
more of a gold hair okay so I'm gonna go
in this one instead that's more bronzy
that's in the shade
simmer I'm just gonna pack that all over
the lid with a flat shader brush and
just very very lightly I'm gonna pick up
this shader right here and I'm gonna
pack that on the outer third I don't
want to add too much but I just wanted
tiny bit of warmth there just to make my
crease a bit more dimension you know I'm
also gonna take that color on my lower
lash line just taking it from it all the
way next up I'm gonna take this
Charlotte Tilbury at the feline flick
the left eye liner and I'm just gonna
line my upper lash line so when I put
the lashes on over the top it kind of
like the lens in you don't I mean oh my
gosh is fluffier why
and then for mascara I'm taking the
Bobbi Brown black what is this one
called a smokey eye mascara I love this
saree much she gets into every single
crevice nest I've been doing this sari
much lately and I love it I'm gonna go
in with the Stila alpine eyeliner this
has a little bit of like pink on it so
I'm just gonna get all of that off
because I don't want a pink waterline
okay so I'm just gonna line my waterline
with this story my eyes look a little
bit big off and then for my lashes I'm
taking these ones by Holy Grail
these ones are in this style of princess
holy crap this are pretty endless oh my
gosh these lashes look amazing I just
put heaps of mascara on them made them
look stupid Slattery and I'm obsessed
okay so let's move on to the face so it
can really Oberon's it up so I'm gonna
go into these sports girl Coco bronze
bronze and blush duo I'm just gonna go
in with a stippling brush and take the
bronzer and a quarry hair honestly I'm
gonna put so much on oh it smells very
nice oh my gosh it has little shimmers
in it as well ah I'm so obsessed with
the shimmery bronzer you have no idea
wow this is so pretty I'm also gonna
take a little bit of the blush and
nothing too much because I want it to be
like mainly bronzy but I just want a
little pop of right on the apples now
for the really fun part I'm gonna go in
with the Anastacio liquid glue in the
shade at polis or I use this in a few
videos back and I actually discovered
that I am used it in the wrong way so
what you've got to do is kind of like
press it into the Beauty Blender this is
what makeup my jaw told Michaels so I'm
just just giving you the information and
then once you pat it in then you can go
in on the face just so it's not like too
harsh
you don't mean okay so far over the top
I'm gonna take the makeup forever
highlight in the shade zero - this one's
a beautiful gold shade so what I'm going
to do is lightly pack that or Eve up my
highlight I'm not gonna sweat too much
cuz I don't want to read it now with
this let's go let's see the fan brush
I'm gonna go away now with my highlight
again
pat it on gently and just highlight my
forehead its hiney bit this brush makes
it so easy to just slap her on or sir on
my key Pittsburgh in my chin me Chloe
everywhere oh my god I went way too
overboard didn't I okay now it's time
for the lips I'm taking my favorite lip
liner this one is the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on lip pencil and we have the
shade insanity okay to be sharpened
thank you and for the lipstick I'm
taking the Urban Decay insanity
oh that's the matching one amazing the
in Sunday cream lipstick okay that's a
little bit true patriot I mean I feel
why is nothing working okay so I just
found a different one I'm gonna use the
Anastasia stripped liquid lipstick
instead I haven't use this in so long
Anasazi has a really good formulas to
make my lips a little bit more glossy
and will plump I'm gonna go into these
sports go a little
plumping a lip gloss so just gonna pack
this on well my lips to be juicy oh my
gosh is starting to tingle already true
set my face I'm gonna go in with the
Urban Decay cooling and hydrating makeup
setting spray it's gonna make my face
look even more glowy so let's all wait I
can't get this on my eyebrows here we
have the finished makeup look I really
hurt you guys like it I love how it
turned out this is like my favorite type
of makeup look to do like not too heavy
on the eyes because I have a small
little baby eyes so when I do dark eye
shadow they look even smaller so I
really like this kind of effect on them
I love being lashes nude lip a really
bronzy face so I will leave all the
products that I use down in the
