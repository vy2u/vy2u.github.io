you
hi guys welcome back to my channel I
hope you're doing well so let's jump
into the makeup tutorial I'm starting
with my brows and this is the Naza brow
defining cream I absolutely love this
this is my first time using it and so
far so good so just define my brows
making a bit of an arch and oh god make
such a difference doesn't it now going
in with the emaki Pro Longwear concealer
I'm just going to clean up under my
brows to make them super harsh and find
I can't do my brows without concealing
them anymore it's literally
life-changing and then I'm going to go
ahead and prime my eyes with the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer again this stuff is
great to cover the veins and stuff
because it is super thick I love it now
going in with the Rimmel stay matte
powder I'm just going to use this to set
that concealer so it's not sticky now we
have some amazing amazing affordable
eyeshadows that I really want to share
with you guys so I recently saw
nikkietutorials using these that caridy
eyeshadows and they are incredible I had
to get my hands on them so these are
very very comparable to the Mac
eyeshadows they're very creamy there's
no fall out very finely milled it's
literally everything you want in an
eyeshadow so as you can see right here
they swatch so beautifully and just ahh
makes my heart melt so the first shade
that I'm going in with is Panama gold
this is just a beautiful transition warm
brown shade I'm just going to take this
from inner corner to outer corner and as
you can see they just blend like a dream
and then of course I'm going in with a
really big fat blending brush just to
blend out any edges next color I'm
taking is safeword by a karat II so this
one is going directly in the crease to
add some definition on a small pencil
brush I am just living for the warm
brown shades and also I just want to say
thank you so much to Carrie for
sponsoring this video you guys know I
would never work with a brand that I
don't truly truly love the next shade
i'm going in with is called diva now
this one is in a go all over the lid I'm
just going to Pat this in with a brush
and just really work it on there to get
the most pigmentation I possibly can
and then I'm just going to go ahead and
blend out the edges once again because
you don't want any harsh lines at all
now for the face I'm taking the Mac
strobe cream I really wanted a jewelry
finish and this is the perfect product
for that it just makes my face look so
healthy and glowy then for foundation
I'm taking the Urban Decay all nighter
in the shade at 6.0 when I first put it
on it was actually pretty light compared
to my fake tan on my neck but then like
10 minutes later it oxidizes and it
matched even better which is kind of
confusing I hate when products oxidize
but it kind of worked out good for me
so this foundation has a very very full
coverage it applied so beautifully with
the Beauty Blender the finish was just
incredible it just looks so airbrushed
and absolutely flawless so don't forget
to blend that into the hairline now for
concealer I'm taking this new Smashbox
concealer I really like this one so I
started off where they're just
cancelling out any discoloration under
my eyes and cleaning up the eye shadow
line because I always blend my eye
shadow out so far and then I wanted a
bit of a highlight down the center of my
face and also under the eyes so I went
in with that same concealer but a lot of
shade and oh my god this product just
blend out so well it's just so creamy
and hydrating it has good coverage as
well which is a plus
then going in with my RC ma no color
powder I'm going to use this to bake I
really do love this powder but I really
wish it was in a different container
because you have to dunk your
Beautyblender in it and you have to tile
it around on your eyes so it's kind of
annoying but it is super affordable so I
can't complain now to set the rest of my
face I'm taking the hello flawless
powder in the shade honey by benefit I
love this because it adds just a touch
of extra coverage as well as setting
that permission and then going in with
the shade it's safeword again I'm taking
this from inner corner to outer corner
just to add a nice wash of color there
and then to highlight that inner corner
I'm taking the shade Tootsie just
popping that on the inner tear-duct oh
my god tear ducts hum though then to
highlight my brow bone I'm taking the
shade birthday suit just brushing that
under my eyebrows super lightly I don't
want it to be true dramatic and this is
a matte shade as well because I feel
like we do have a lot of shimmer going
on now going in with the balm what's
your type mascara I'm just gonna coat my
top and bottom lashes
I love this mascara because it's super
affordable and it also is super
volumizing so now I'm going to go in
with a black liner just to line my top
lash line to make sure that the lashes
that we put on over the top the band
won't be visible for the lashes today
I'm taking these beautiful fluffy ones
buy it Lillie lashes just popping those
on and I feel like the whole eye look is
just completely 20 times better more
put-together and more glamorous now for
bronzer and taking the Rimmel and
natural bronzer this isn't my favorite I
just really wanted to swap up the
products and I was using I'm just going
to use this to kind of contour a little
bit add some color to my face
now going in with the Makah goal deposit
I love to use this as a bronzer because
it's super bronzy and shimmery and it
just adds so much life into the face so
just putting this on my cheekbones and
also around my forehead it just adds the
most beautiful sunkissed color of course
I'm looking at my friends now going in
with this a Becca blush this is
literally red as I said before I just
want to like use products I don't
usually use so I think this looked
pretty good considering how intense it
was then I'm going to bake using my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
just because my contour and bronzer got
a little bit messy so that was like
literally my lifesaver
now taking some mac fix+ I'm just going
to spray my Anastasia highlighting brush
aka the best highlighting brush of life
then I'm going to go in with the cocoa
bling highlighter by artist Couture and
oh my god this is so stunning I'm going
to put this on the highest point of my
face and honestly I'm waiting for the
day that they come out with like pressed
powder highlights I'm going to be live
Bing it's so stunning I just like I
can't really deal I really just can't
for the liquid lipstick today I'm taking
this one by Mello cosmetics this is a
beautiful peachy pink color
I throw tied in perfectly with the eyes
so this one is in the shade at Barcelona
just coating this all over my lipids and
then I'm going in with the Geoffrey
style liquid lipstick in the shade I'm
nude I just wanted to add like a nice
lighter pinky nude look to it just to
make it a bit more wearable for me
because I'm not really into the pink
looks but this was like as pink as I
would go so finishing it off with a
little bit of mascara on my false lashes
just because I like my lashes super long
and intense and then of course last but
not least I'm going in with the urban
decay and makeup setting spray just to
lock everything in place and then we are
done so I really hope you guys enjoyed

massive thumbs up I love you a love you
