so today's video is going to be a really
really easy hair tutorial I'll just be
showing you how I achieve is really soft
and loose looking waves so let's get
started so the first thing that I like
to do is part my hair so it's roughly in
line with the top of my ears and then I
just go ahead and clip it out of the way
and then I'll just take a piece of hair
that is roughly 2 centimeters in width
and then I'll just wrap the wand around
my hair I don't do this any particular
way I'll just wrap it anyway and be
really careful that you don't burn your
ears because we've all been there
and keep in mind when you're curling
your hair the curls will hold a much
better if you have like two or three day
old hair so you haven't washed up two or
three days and then you can just put
some dry shampoo in the root so you
can't tell that it's oily and also
another way to keep your curls in for
longer is to spray your hair before you
curl them and to spray them after just
to make sure the hold stays all day and
also I didn't use a heat protectant
spray because I didn't think we had any
but turns out we do so don't forget to
use a heat protectant spray okay so when
I'm creating these soft waves I
generally like to slip my hair up in
three sections so the bottom section on
my hair the middle section and now I'm
moving on to the top but I didn't show
you the middle section because it's
exactly the same as the bottom so I hope
that's not too confusing so now I'm
moving on to the fringe and I'm taking a
little bit of my fringe and wrapping it
around the barrel away from my face just
so the curls don't fall onto my face
so after I've killed each string of my
hair I like to take my finger and wrap
it around my hair the same way that it
was cold just so the curls are nice and
tight so all I'm doing is just taking
random pieces of my hair and I'm just
working my right around the other side
of my head it's so easy anyone could do
this look and also I do have hair
extensions in so if you wanna see the
video of me applying them then I'll have
the link down below
so this is the really important part if
you want soft looking waves just go
ahead and take a brush and brush through
your hair it won't get rid of the way we
will just make them look really soft and
healthy and I just love the way it makes
it look
I just went ahead and part of my hair in
the middle and of course you guys can
part your hair wherever you want but I
feel like this is what suits me the most
and then I just went ahead and hairspray
my hair and this is the finished result
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did don't forget to
give it a big thumbs up and I'll see you
soon
adios amigos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
