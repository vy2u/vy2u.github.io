let's go ahead and jump straight into
this makeup look because I am obsessed
so starting with the brows I'm taking
this a mellow cosmetics eyebrow duo and
I'm going to take the darker side and
just start carving my brows out I really
like using powders lately because it
just looks a lot more natural and when I
was using the pomades not too long ago
it looked really just like fake and
drawn on I do like that look a lot of
the time but I'm now just feeling a
natural brow today and I absolutely love
this product now going in with the mac
prolongwear concealer in the shade NC 20
I'm just going to carve out underneath
my brows even though the brows are very
natural this is going to give a really
defined crisp look going in with that
same concealer I'm going to prime my
very eyelids and then Pat it down with a
Beauty Blender then I'm going to set
that with a powder just to make sure all
the eyeshadows blend out seamlessly I
never ever miss this step now let's move
on to the eyeshadow I'm taking the NYC
smooth skin bronzing face powder I'm
using this as the transition shade I'm
just going to blend this in my crease
from inner corner to outer corner and
really diffuse it and it's also going to
add some dimension to my lid as well
because I have very undone mention or
lids let's be real I'm going to take a
really big fluffy brush and blend out
any edges then I'm going in with the
chichi spices palette and picking up a
warm burgundy brown as I always do I'm
obsessed with these colors this is going
in the crease to add even more dimension
so just taking a smaller blending brush
and just focusing this on the outer
corner and then going back in with a
blending brush because I blend like
literally for half an hour straight when
I'm doing my eye shadow then I'm going
to take the same color and the same
brush I'm just going to work this
actually on the outer corner on the lid
and then i'm going in with the mac
prolongwear concealer and this is where
the fun stuff starts okay so if you guys
don't follow by broeckel and instagram
you have to because she started this
whole trend and i'm literally obsessed
with it it's basically like a cut crease
but it's the easiest way to do it so
just carving out your crease with
concealer oh my god I'm I'm amazed you
guys need to follow her right now I
would have to say the easiest way to do
this cut crease is just to take a and
gold eyeliner brush to carve out the
line and then a regular concealer brush
to cover the inner half of the mobile
lid then I'm going in with a powder just
to set that concealer because if you put
eyeshadow over the top straightaway it
tends to crease since this concealer is
so thick so then we're going in with the
lid color I'm taking this iconic
highlighter iconic London this is a
beautiful pinky shade I couldn't
actually find it in like my eyeshadow
collection which is crazy because I have
so many eyeshadows but this is the
perfect color I just wanted something
really elegant and I think it's stunning
so I'm just taking a really defined
small brush and making sure to be very
neat with this black shadow then taking
that same at crease color I'm going to
use this to blend the two shades
together on the lid so they blend into
one another I'm just taking a small
blending brush and kind of patting over
the truth then taking my Mac strobe
cream I love this for really like gooey
finish it is absolutely stunning and it
feels really hydrating on the face as
well it kind of has like a pearl finish
so just blending that in with a
stippling brush and then I'm going in
with the iconic London foundation
pigment Stix these are in sane so I'm
going to start with a darker shade to do
a bit of cream contouring I will leave
all the shades that I use down below
they are spot-on so I'm taking this
around the perimeter of my face and also
under my cheekbones this is going to
give a really nice contoured look
without using powder and oh my god it
was so much fun because I never do this
so then I'm going in with my foundation
shade and putting this everywhere I'm
not going to highlight or contour and
this color is stunning I love all of the
yellow tones like
oh yes give it to me so I'm just going
to blend that out with a stippling brush
these blends so easily they have amazing
amazing coverage they're just very
creamy so after I've blended that shade
in I'm going in with the contour shade
so I'm making sure not to move a true
fire apple down I'm just going to take
it in really small circular motions and
this color is so beautiful and bronzy
we're good and now taking my highlight
shade so I'm putting this in between my
brows the down the center of my nose a
little bit under my eyes but not too
close like as to where I'd put my
concealer and the main reason that I
wanted to use this is to clean up any of
the darker shade that I put down so
mainly like under my contour it's like a
good way to bake without using powder so
I'm just blending that out with the same
brush but I did wipe off any of the
darker shade that I put on before so the
true colors didn't mix together and then
I'm going in with the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer to make sure there are no
dark circles peeking through so I'm just
putting this directly under my eyes and
blending that out with a Beauty Blender
and then I'm going in with the s-bahn
powder to set that down I love this
stuff the very very affordable and it
does a great job so just packing this
directly under my eyes I'm not taking it
too far up because I'm putting a cream
highlighter down the highlighter that
I'm using is the iconic London strobing
stick in the shade shine this is
absolutely insane if you want a really
intense highlighter so I'm starting by
packing this on with my finger to really
warm it up into the skin and then I went
in with a Beauty Blender over the top to
make it even more intense and a very
seamless and I'm gonna be shared shanem
right like a diamond Wow I'm quickly
going in with Rimmel stay matte powder
to set my face but I'm leaving the
highlighted area wet so now taking a my
give me Sun by Mac I'm just gonna be
bronzing up my face to give some warmth
this is such a beautiful shade I always
go for this bloody bronzer as you guys
will know so just under my cheekbones
and around my forehead now I'm taking
the iconic a London highlighting palette
and I'm picking up that same shade that
I put on the lid and using this to set
that strobing stick and to make it 20
times more intense I wanted this to be
like focused around like the glow
I'm also putting that on my Cupid's bow
and on the tip of my nose on my forehead
you know what I'm just gonna put it all
over my face why not and then taking my
lip color I'm gonna put this from inner
corner to outer corner on my lower lash
line to proportion out the eye shadow
then going in with the what's your type
mascara by the balm this is hands-down
one my favorite mascara ever and isn't
amazing that it's affordable as well so
coating my top and bottom lashes then
I'm going in with Dee Lily lashes I do
have a discount code if you guys are
sitting and saving some money I don't
know that's a matter if you do or don't
use it but these lashes are incredible
okay so now time for the most beautiful
lip color you've ever seen this is from
la splash so it's incredibly inexpensive
putting this all over my lips just be
aware that this is a very drying lip
formula because it is so cheap it's not
very moisturizing like a Jeffrey star or
Kylie cosmetics but for the price you're
definitely getting what you pay for now
going in with the jeffree star cosmetics
liquid lipstick and putting this
basically in the center of the lips and
blending outwards just to make a lot of
shade of that lipstick and these two
colors together are literally everything
I hope sets with it so there we go I
hope you guys like this video this
choker that I'm wearing by the way is
from Lovisa a lot of people have been
asking at chokers are so in at the
moment I literally just bought like 15
