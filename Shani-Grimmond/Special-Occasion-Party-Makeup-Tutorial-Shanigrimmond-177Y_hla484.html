so today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this look right here it's
just a gold smokey eye and a nude lip so
I think you'd be perfect for any special
occasions such as a party or clubbing or
anything like that so the first thing
I'm doing is taking my Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer just to make
sure my makeup stays on all day or night
and now taking my covergirl outlast stay
fabulous foundations I'm just going to
be mixing the two colors golden tan and
medium beige are we putting two pumps on
the back of the flat surface and then
blending it into my face with a Real
Techniques expert face brush and the
reason why I use two colors is because I
don't actually have the perfect shade
and after I just buff this into my face
and then going to be tapping it just to
make sure there's no lines visible
taking the NYX jumbo pencil in the shade
at milk I'm just going to be using this
to primer I just make sure my eyeshadow
stays on all night I'm now taking my new
eyeshadow palette I'm going to be taking
that gold right there and I'm just going
to be packing that all over my lid and
I'll leave the link to where i bought
the eyeshadow palette down below it's so
pretty and the colors are really really
pigmented and to blend out the
eyeshadows I'm just going to be using
the Too Faced natural eye palette and
I'll be using the shade at Velvet
Revolver I'll just be blending this up
into my crease just so all the colors
blend up nice and seamlessly
and now taking this darker gold shader
right here I'm just going to be packing
this onto the outer V of my eye just as
the more definition
okay so time for the fun part I'll be
taking this black shimmery shade and
just going to be packing this from the
outer half of my eye into kind of the
middle of my eye but as we get into the
inner corner just pack it less intense
if you know what I mean
so make sure it fades in nicely and of
course I'm just going to be blending out
that eye shadow once again and then
after that I'm just going to keep
packing on the black eye shadow until I
get the intensity that I want and after
that I'll just be blending it out with a
different blending brush
and now taking my mac prolongwear
concealer in the shade and c20 and a
damp Beauty Blender I'm just gonna be
doing my concealer because under my eyes
was really purple and I was really
bugging me so I'm quickly doing my
concealer and then we'll go back to eyes
I only have the tiniest bit of concealer
left so I'm going to definitely have to
go and buy some more I love this
concealer and to set that I'm taking my
crusher cosmetics contour palette and
this yellow a light shade right there
and I'm just going to be using this to
make sure my concealer stays in place
all night and to make sure it doesn't
budge taking the same gold shade that I
put all over my lid before I'm just
going to be taking this on my lower lash
line and it's not really showing off on
camera but yeah you'll be able to see it
at the end and then I'll be taking the
black shade and I'll be putting that on
the outer half of my lower lash line
to finish off the eyeshadow I'm going to
be taking this shimmery white shade and
I'm using this to highlight so I'll be
putting this in the inner corners of my
eye and also on my brow bone and in the
video I did use a matte white on my brow
bone but then I went back and fixed it
and put the shimmery white there because
it looked a bit better
after I've lined my waterline with the
NYX jumbo pencil in the shade milk I'll
be taking the benefit they're real
mascara and absolutely
flogging my lashes in business car
because I love big lashes
time for falsies I'm going to be taking
my red cherry lashes and then after I've
applied them I'm just going to pinch
them together with my natural lashes
just to make sure they say all night
moving on to eyebrows I'm taking the
chichi eyebrow pencil and I'm gonna
start filling in my brows and when I go
out on like a special occasion or
anything like that I generally like to
fill in my eyebrows quite heavily so
that's what I'm doing here and I'm also
going to make an arch in my eyebrows
well okay so this is totally random
adding this in right here but I'd love
to know where you guys are from so
please leave it in the comments below
because I just want to have an idea
where most of you guys are coming from
anyways back to business sar now taking
a spooly just to brush through my brows
to make sure the pencil blends out
really nicely and it will just get rid
of any harsh lines
time to contour I'm going to be taking
this concealer palette with all these
different colors and I'll be taking two
dark shades on a deluxe crease brush by
Real Techniques and I was going to be
running this on the hollows of my cheek
so I'm going to be patting a bit so my
cheap brands stand out and then I'll
just be running a line up there just to
define it and then I'll be going ahead
and blending it all together
after I blended that contour out and
will be taking my Mac mineralized
skinfinish natural in the shed give me
Sun and I'm going to be bronzing my face
up a bit I love this bronzer it's so
pretty so I'll be putting this under my
cheekbones on my jaw line of my temples
and also down the sides of my nose just
to add some more color to my face and
for blush I'll be taking the Mac
mineralized blush in the shade at warm
sole and I'll just be putting this on
the back of my cheekbones and then
blending it forwards just for a nice
flush of color
and time to highlight I'm taking my mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade soft
and gentle and I love the way this
product looks when I apply it with my
fingers so that's what I'm doing here
I'll be putting this on the top of my
cheekbones and also on my Cupid's bow
and last but not least I'll be taking my
MAC lipstick in this shade it's just a
gorgeous nude shade but since it is
really really nude I'm going to be
taking the Rimmel Apokolips lip lacquer
in the shade a nude Eclipse just to give
it a bit more of a brown effect because
it was like foundation lips and then we
are done so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you do recreate this
