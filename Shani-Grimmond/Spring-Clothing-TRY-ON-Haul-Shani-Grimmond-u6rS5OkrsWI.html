channel so I'm doing a clothing haul
today I only do these every so often so
when I do them I always get so excited I
honestly love clothes so much I have the
biggest pile down here and I can't wait
to share them with you because they are
so nice it's coming into spring in
Australia so I have a new I have a few
new things well a lot of new things so
let's go ahead and jump straight into it
so I'm going to start with princess
Polly we have a lot of things from there
I've been shopping from princess Polly
for the longest time now literally like
since I was a fetus I also have a 20%
off discount code at store wide and that
is sh a and I 20 so you guys can go here
oh my god I got so many winners let's
get into it the first one is this a
little play suit right here this would
have to be my favorite piece of the
whole entire haul it's so comfortable
you can dress it up you can dress it
down I wore this clubbing and it just
looks so dressy with like a nice
bralette peeking through like the booby
area or you could just wear it shopping
something really comfy and nice at the
same time and I also got it in white
because you know when you love something
you have to get it in every single color
yes the next thing that we have is
another jumpsuit from princess Polly as
well it has little flared sleeves and it
ties up around the waist to really like
suck it in you're not I mean I love the
print of this I guess like florals
coming in because I have a few other
pieces that are floral as well I feel
like it doesn't look as good just like
this but when it's on it honestly looks
breathtaking I love this so much the
brand is reverse oh I earn like
everything from a verse I honestly love
this brand next I got another jumpsuit
because I am on a roll with jumpsuits
and I've just been obsessed with them
lately so this one is kind of like a
silky material it's very lightweight and
comfortable long sleeve and again it is
cinched around the waist and I love the
little detailing it has around the boob
area it's not just like a plain jumpsuit
it has a little something different to
it I love this one by the way I'm a size
8 in everything of princess Polly and it
all fits perfectly the next thing that
we have is a pair of just staple black
high-waisted pants I have a really
really long torso so I like my high
waisted pants to go past my belly button
so it has to be
really high to be able to do that and
these fit honestly like a glove this is
the best fitting high-waisted pants I've
ever come across and they have the
zipper up the back I think they just
look really classy like I'm not really
into the denim high-waisted pants
anymore like the short denim ones I
don't know this is kind of what I lean
towards now instead well another
jumpsuit that I have looks like this I
was just obsessed with the color when I
saw this color I was like I have to get
it again this is a very shiny like silky
material it is long-sleeve but it cuts
out on the arm right here you just tie
it up I just have to take my nipples in
any jumpsuits I have to like it
Hollywood tape right here so nothing
comes out in that region
well I comment to where this next we
have some Sunny's these are the key X
desi Perkins Sunny's these are honestly
it's so incredible that oversized
aviators and they have like a pinky
tinge to the frames oh my god these are
stunning honestly good work desi for
doing this designing this like these are
like so luxurious looking and just so
classy mmm
oh yeah next thing I have is this a
one-piece right here I love anything
lace I just think it looks so dainty and
girly and pretty so what I thought I
could wear this with is just like a
high-waisted dressy white pants I think
it's going to look absolutely stunning
so since it is getting really hot I
thought this would be perfect cause it's
really thin and at least the nipples are
covered but everything else is pretty
much see-through I'm so excited to share
these with you these are the prettiest
earrings I have ever seen they're like
really bright gold cross earrings they
are a little bit heavy but they're
definitely like wearable I just think
they add so much puzzle to your outfit
or makeup and it just makes it look 20
times better and more put together so
I've had this piece for about a month
now but I don't think I've ever spoke
about it on my channel it is so
incredibly comfortable but so dressy at
the same time it's a green Karki colored
high-waisted skirt this one is from ice
it was so inexpensive and I think it's
cotton it's really stretchy and
comfortable it has the elastic band
around the waist so it's it's really
high up I just love this so freakin much
next up we have this
laptop from butter this goes really well
with like long high-waisted skirts like
the one I just showed you this one is
really open in the boob area it's a
really like sheer light material it
looks perfect this is the prettiest top
I've ever owned the only annoying thing
is you do have to put on Hollywood tape
on the booty area so you don't have a
nipple slip if you don't want Hollywood
tape your boobs gonna be out completely
but I'm very grateful
I found this beauty I feel like this
cotton shirts is like really coming in
as well I just realized that I have a
lot of this style speaking of that style
we have another one so it has like the
droopy neck this one is from and curry
it is like a really nice nudey
lightweight singlet goes with so many
different things I love like pieces that
you can just wear with like jeans you
can wear with high-waisted pants you can
wear them with so many different things
and make so many different looks out of
them this is a really good quality this
is a really good quality material as
well I love and co they have some
amazing amazing stuff okay so the next
thing that we have here is this top from
Melrose Avenue that's like the really
cheap boutiques or stunning this is what
it looks like
floral again it is long sleeve but again
it is light material so it's perfect for
spring it is a low cut around the boobs
but it has these little Criss crosses
right here to hold them in so you don't
actually have to worry about getting
Hollywood tape which is like amazing
the print on this is absolutely stunning
like when I first looked at it I'm like
does this look too grandma put it on
lost my marbles next we have another
pair of high-waisted pants these ones
are from chic I've actually never owned
a pair of hoursa pants that fit so well
these ones are a size six when usually
on my sides eight I'm not sure why that
happened but I do have these in black as
well in the eight and they're just a bit
too loose but they do have like the belt
buckle that you can use to make them
tighter anyway they're very dressy they
can still wear them as casual pants
obviously because they're just like high
waisted pants but oh my god the material
is just super thick and they just look
so businessí but they're high waisted
so it's like no it's like a win-win the
next thing that we have is this a black
place ooh this one goes all the way to
the knees and it has like that stretchy
um stuff at the back so it is really
really tight around this area right here
one size my own cool chi
rip the tags off because they itch man
pretty sure signs a and it fits really
nicely it is really uncomfortable throw
but like beauty is pain am i right next
we have a really really pretty
dressy dress this one is from style spot
really long that Parsa knees are really
crisp white shade I love the cut of the
top I want to get this in just a top it
has these little slips here that you put
your arm in the only thing I don't like
about this style of dress is that you
can't lift your arms up past here it's
really restricted you can only be like
this so I guess for a special occasion
you're not going to be waving your arms
around in the air anyway but this is a
very very pretty dress and it fits
beautifully the last clothing item that
we have is from mesh key it is a cropped
jacket this is absolutely stunning I
love the color of this it's also that
suede material so it's really soft I
liked with this over the shoulders and
not actually put my arms in because I
feel like it's a little bit big when I
put it on properly I think it's like a
bigger fit but over the shoulders it
looks so pretty and so dressy Vindhya
why do you look so happy you should just
go back in the park lessor you know you
young you sure yeah you so much last but
not least we have these black heels
these ones are from Ruby I didn't
actually realize how short the heel was
on these heels but when they're on they
look really classy I actually bought
these for clubbing because I didn't want
something too high for clothing or and
you think too uncomfortable so this is
perfect I wore these out to the races
and they were pretty comfortable there
are like photos as well so it's like a
bargain I love the little buckle that's
on the side as well I just think that's
so classy even though one of my toenails
is completely gone because when I went
clubbing one of my friends didn't it and
it died and then it came off so I don't
have a toenail and you can definitely
see when I wear these but what can you
do Han okay so there we have my clothing
