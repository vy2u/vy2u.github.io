in today's video I'm doing a YouTube
advice so for all of you that want to
start a successful YouTube channel
I guess this video isn't for everyone so
if you aren't interested in this I will
have another video up in about two or
three days so stay tuned for that yeah I
have a lot of tips to share with you
guys I've been doing YouTube for about
two years now and I have learnt a lot I
have pretty much learned the hard way
because I had no one to help me out so
I'm just going to help you guys out and
hopefully you learn some tips and tricks
so let's go ahead and get started okay
so I have a list of things on my phone
that I want to talk about whether it's
something really important that I want
to start this video off saying and that
is if you guys are interested in
starting a channel you're interested in
making videos I would definitely say
just go for it give it a try it is so
much fun that YouTube is literally like
another world it is definitely my
biggest hobby I spent so much time doing
it but I know a lot of people are really
scared of making videos because they're
scared of what other people are going to
think of them or what they're going to
say about them but they don't even worth
your time it is just like the happiness
that I get and I know a lot of other
people get from making videos and
posting them is so much more than what
other people think of you don't even
worry about them they ain't and if
you guys didn't know I have icontact's
on today they're blue and I'm freaking
success with them so the first thing
I'll talk about is equipment and I think
this is an extremely important thing if
you go back and watch the Ella's videos
or my videos or Shannon Harris's if you
watch any youtubers videos that I've
been doing this for quite a long time
you can see their video quality
progressing and I don't think that you
have to go out straightaway and buy an
expensive camera or expensive expensive
lighting 3mm hey you know what I'm
saying you don't need to go buy
expensive things straight away I would
definitely say just start off with even
an iPhone or any camera they have laying
around the house I would only say the
back camera on the iPhone with the flash
on especially and then just sit in front
of natural lighting and that should
start you for a few videos and then when
you know that you definitely want to get
into it I'll start getting some really
good equipment because there are so many
people on YouTube that have amazing
quality and it's kind of hard to compete
because people using these
like amazing professional cameras and
you know I guess you'd rather watch that
then watch someone's really bad quality
video but I would just say when you're
just making your first video just use
whatever you have I wouldn't go and buy
a new camera straight away but when
you're starting to get more serious it
is extremely important to get a great
quality camera the one that I started
off with was the canon 600d that is
about five to six hundred dollars in
Australia at six hundred dollars and it
comes with a lens and everything and it
is amazing quality it's really high HD
and it just does everything that you
need I really really wanted an upgrade
it for my camera because the canon 600d
didn't have autofocus and when I'm doing
makeup tutorials I'm like hmm and I'm
like moving in and out all the time but
it doesn't focus so I have to sit there
and like change the focusing thing and
that's just really annoying so I went
ahead and got the Canon EOS 70d and that
has autofocus and touch screen and
everything and you want to make sure
when you get a camera if you're doing
makeup tutorials I would say get one
that has a flip screen right here a
viewfinder because it tells you if
you're recording or if it tells you it
just has a picture of you so you can see
whatever you're doing so that's great if
you're making other kind of videos like
lifestyle I would still recommend
getting something with a viewfinder just
in case it stops recording because
canons or all cameras stop recording
after a certain amount of time and you
could lose all your footage which would
be really annoying okay so that's the
camera there amazing the canon 600d is
canon 70d s
great great quality and then we can talk
about lenses okay so my camera just died
for a whole hour so I have to give my
head back into this whole lens game so
lens that I use is just the normal one
that comes with the camera when you buy
in a set it comes with a lens it's an
amazing lens it is basically just like I
say I'm pretty sure like it just is the
same width from outside it has zoom in
and out and the quality is really good
if I want something that looks a bit
more professional with a really very
very a really blurry background I like
to use my Sigma 13 millimeter 1.4 lens
the only thing I don't like about this
is it's a prime lens so it doesn't zoom
in and out which kind of sucks
especially when you're doing makeup
videos but if you do want that really
soft background it just looks real
professional I do recommend this one it
was extremely pricey so I'll only say
this if you feel like you really need it
and you feel I could make a huge
difference with the type of videos that
you're making so I guess you can just go
into the shop and see what it's like but
it is a really really good quality lens
and it's so heavy okay so now let's talk
about lighting lighting is honestly so
important when it comes to making
YouTube videos you want to make sure
that everything is really clean and
crisp and nice and bright so you can see
everything that you're watching so the
best type of lighting is natural
lighting so if you can sit in front of a
massive window so all the light can come
in and brighten everything up and then I
also have that two soft boxes one on
either side of me to make sure there's
no shadows on my face and to make sure
my background is nice and wide and I
also have a ring light which is right in
front of me so that's just both that's
just basically a bulb of fluorescent
light that just goes warm so it lights
up my whole entire face another in oh
well before I carry on I'm just going to
say that the ring lights are extremely
important but they're the best type of
lights for beauty related things it just
lights your face up and it does an
amazing job so I would recommend that
even though they're really pricey that
definitely worth it another important
thing when it comes to lighting is
making sure your lighting is white so
you want all white light bulbs because
if you have yellow light bulbs you can
look like Bart Simpson and it's not
going to look natural at all now talking
about editing so editing makes such a
difference in your videos if you really
put the time in to edit your videos it
will look so much different so for
example it could take me from an hour to
about six hours to end a video depending
on what kind of is so I would say the
best type of editing program for me like
that I find it easiest and most
effective is on Apple computers which is
Final Cut Pro X it was like three
hundred and sixty dollars again it's not
something that you want to buy straight
away because it is quite expensive when
you start getting into the habit of
things and start making more money and I
would would recommend Final Cut Pro it's
so easy to use and it just has an
amazing amazing things on there if you
do have Apple Computer I would recommend
using iMovie to start off with that is
what I start off with and it did a good
job I had Windows make
no moviemaker when I had windows and I
was shocking it really was shocking but
did the job so I guess if you have a
Windows computer that will work for the
time being but I would recommend to get
in Final Cut Pro a really important
thing about kind of getting views on
your video is making sure that you have
a really nice thumbnail and a really
eye-catching title so for the thumbnail
I use picmonkey.com which is a really
easy sigh to use you just put a bunch of
photos in a picture so you make a
collage and then you write something in
it with a text and stuff so it's always
good to make it really colorful and put
a few different pictures in there for
variations stuff so it did take a while
to get used to it but if you go YouTube
YouTube how to make a thumbnail and
PicMonkey it'll help you so much that's
how I learnt that one and also making a
really eye-catching title so if you just
go ahead and read up you tubers titles
and kind of get some ideas of what they
have it really does help a lot so for
example if you're doing a question and
answers video you wouldn't really just
write question and answers with SHINee
you would write something like a
question that was answered in there that
kind of makes people go what I wrote one
time did a question Nexus video and it
someone asked me if I'd rather drink pee
or poo so I wrote the caption as um
something about me drinking pee and
people would have thought that's really
weird I'm going to click on it and see
what it's about so that's what I mean by
an eye-catching title I'm going to make
sure that all of that stands out as far
as backgrounds go I think it's important
to kind of make them look really
colorful not too messy not too many
things in the background but something
that's just really really nice and clean
looking so I just have my IKEA desks and
my perfume and some flowers to give it
some color I really would have changed
my background it's been like this for
like a year now it's time to get really
boring so it is a good idea to
frequently change up your background
like sometimes I go out into my room and
you know I just try to best to change it
up as like as much as I can so it is a
good idea to put like lights in the back
and lamps and just add some different
things in there every here and there and
it really does like compliment your
videos so backgrounds are important I
remember when I started I'm pretty sure
let's use like a white wall it did the
job for a few videos as far as content
goes I would definitely say always
change it up because you don't want your
viewers getting bored so for example
don't put 10
make up tutorials up in a row because
people get bored of that don't do 500 of
the same that makeup looks like a lot of
beauty gurus do myself included I'm
pretty sure people complain about me
always doing neutral makeup so you know
change up add some color in there maybe
some halls or some question notices
videos or just some fun topics anything
really depending on what kind of lack
theme your channel is it's always going
to do to change up you'll be yours this
is something that I feel like not many
people know but when you have back our
music you have to make sure that it's
royalty-free so that means that you have
permission from the artist to put it in
your videos otherwise if you use other
people's music it is classified as
copyright and a whole lot of stuff
happens if you use people's music that
you're not allowed to so make sure you
type in royalty-free music on YouTube
copy and paste it and download it and
stuff or you can go into the YouTube
library and get all of their
royalty-free music I just got a message
my bad I'm sorry I only put music in
some videos just the ones that I think
is appropriate so when there's silence
or anything I like to put in music for
the video I just like to put really calm
and relaxed not elute relaxing stuff in
there so now something everyone wants to
know about and that is getting paid from
YouTube okay so if you want to study you
do but I would definitely not go into it
thinking I want to get paid I want this
is my job I think going it's YouTube
it's something that you should be really
passionate about and something that just
makes you happy and as a bonus you also
get paid if you have like enough
subscribers and all of that stuff so
just YouTube how to monetize your videos
and eventually you can start getting
paid a lot of youtubers get paid like
all of your favourite youtubers would
get paid for putting the ads in front of
their videos and that just happens
automatically all you have to do is
press monetize and then you'll get paid
so something that's really going to help
you grow is to upload frequently so
making sure they upload as much as you
can I'm not saying that you have to
upload every single day I'd upload every
two days what every three days is
absolutely amazing I know some people
upload once a month or once a week or
something and that's fine it's really up
to you but I know that people do like
fresh content and I feel like when you
have a favorite youtuber you want to see
YouTube videos from them all the time I
feel like I have a connection with a few
youtubers that I watch and they upload
every three days
is there's not really many you as I
watch constantly that upload like once a
month just because that's just so enough
for me so another great way to get your
subscribers growing is to ask other
people if they want to do collabs so
just message them and ask you know if
they want to do a video together and
collaborate and you know mention each
other inside the video or something or
even make a video in the same room that
kind of collab I personally don't do
many collabs I just like to grow my
audience on my own but I know that is an
amazing way to get other people's
subscribers and kind of just share them
around which is a great idea um so just
message to them and ask on we got to
make sure that they have the same amount
of subscribers as you do obviously not
going to ask like someone that has a
million subscribers if you've got like a
thousand so you got to keep it fair and
yeah I think that's a great way to grow
your audience so last but not least I
would have to say the most important
thing about making a YouTube channel is
be you be 100% yourself because there
are millions of youtubers on YouTube one
of my thing there are millions of
personalities on line and you don't want
to be like anyone else you want to be
yourself you want to be unique and you
know just just say whatever you want to
say do whatever you want to do and I
feel like that's what's gonna get you
the farthest I knew know if that's a
word but I'm just gonna say it anyway I
know for myself when I first started
making videos I was so incredibly
nervous and it took me so long to come
out of my shell I just sit in front of
the camera just practice just get
comfortable with this big thing in front
of you and talking to it so that's
pretty much all the tips that I have to
share with you guys today while always
moving my hands hopefully you guys found
this useful or even a little bit
interesting because I definitely do
think behind the scenes of YouTube is so
incredibly different to just watching
like a five or ten minute video that
someone's made it does take a lot of
effort in time to make a good quality
video so yeah if you guys have that
thought in the back of your head that
you're like I want to make youtube
videos we think it's going to make you
happy or anything just go ahead and at
least try it because it honestly is so
so much fun yeah that's everything that
I have to say for today I'll see you
guys in my next video bye okay so now
for mascara I'm taking my L'Oreal
telescopic extra bath mullet extra black
mascara this isn't a scar that I've been
loving for so many years now
and I've just repurchased it black the
fifth time and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
