my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a story time of three different things
that have been kind of up that
have happened in my life there's nothing
like out of the extraordinary that's
happened I know there's like a lot of
youtubers that have like these crazy-ass
stalker videos and I'm glad that doesn't
happen to me because that's
scary but it makes good story time
videos and it's really fun to watch so I
just thought I would share three things
that have happened to me so let's go
ahead and get started so let's start
with probably the most embarrassing
thing that's ever happened to me so I
went to a YouTube convention with my
friend Chloe and there was a bunch of
other youtubers there um and I went to
lunch with Chloe and Troy Saban's family
um and yeah we're just eating away we
just went up there with it Hey and then
like come sit with us so I did we start
eating breakfast and then Chloe and I
were like okay so we're going to go now
and we got up and walked off and then
we're in the bus um going somewhere else
- like Bondi Junction or something - go
to the beach and Chloe's like oh my
 god knows like watches like we
did not pay for our food and also so I
text at Roy and I was like um I think I
forgot to pay for my food like literally
that is the most embarrassing
thing ever because that would cover
cross as so rude I would never do
something like that intentionally and he
replied back he's like no it's fine I
got it and I'm like Lana I honestly
don't know what was going through my
mind to just get up and walk away and
not think to pay for my food I just
obviously wasn't thinking very well
we are stilted to stay me and Chloe oh
that family at least $30 each it says
okay so the next thing that happened to
me was like a few months ago it was a
really scary
uber driver experience I've been
catching ubers for the longest time and
it's so cheap and easy and if you're
drinking obviously you don't want to
drink it around so you just get an uber
so that's what I do all the time so I
went to a soccer game with my family and
there was too many carts too many people
for like one ruber so we split up the
Eva I went with my little sister so I
ordered it always good and then the
other got there didn't say anything
which i think is fine because small talk
sometimes I just can't be bothered to do
that so
sitting in the whole car ride and it
would sound the whole time and then we
got around to where I live
and I was like excuse me can you just um
pull over here I just live here didn't
say anything we kept driving excuse me
um can you stop and then he kept driving
didn't say anything and I was like
and I like literally was shooting myself
I'm like is he literally like like where
is he taking me is he gonna kill me he's
gonna take me to a dungeon and I'm with
my little sister so I'm like freaking
out because I don't want her to get hurt
I don't want her to be scared and I was
like excuse please stop and I was like
starting to freak the Frog out and
didn't tell anything so I put my hand in
front of his face I was like you know
doing doing all that and um he's like
I'm like oh he's deaf I'm a
asshole I didn't see any signs or
anything I just thought that would be
like a sign just so I would know so
we're like a 200 meters or something
pass where I live and I was like I was
trying to be like really nice oh I
didn't know how and then yeah I just
jumped out and walked all right
and I was really scared because I
thought I was about to get um murdered
or something
okay so the next thing that happened to
me is like a paranormal story so if you
guys don't like ghosts and you probably
don't like this story but I like I
didn't have a problem with ghosts like I
believed in them but I mind my own
business if they mind their own business
like please don't hurt me because I'm
 scared of you um so probably in
about like grade 7 grade six I had a
really good friend named Jasmine still
good friends we grew up together and
Isis leave over a house every single
weekend she had like had so many things
happen to her and like her family with a
ghost so those 100 percent of gerson and
every time I come over every single time
I went to a house something would happen
so here we were just minding our own
business playing PlayStation Mario Cart
and eating our little cheese-and-cracker
dips and having fun you know and then
all of a sudden the TV just got shhh and
the whole screen goes blank well it goes
you know how it's like that light gray
dark red little balls it's like really
fuzzy so just like a game turned off and
that fuzzy screen came on and it
literally her outline I've got goose
bumps right now outline of the old lady
ghost face was in
TV and she's like did you say
that and she I mean like both like just
got up and ran all the way out into the
kitchen which is the other side of the
house so her rooms like at the other end
by ourselves and literally freaking out
and to make it even worse the power plug
had like exploded so it just there was
smoke coming out of the power plug and
it was like smoking and I was like what
the hell and also the old lady used to
lay in the couch like just lay on the
couch you can see her indent of her body
on the bed so you can see how like bum
ended you can see her back and just look
at it and you can kind of see it like
moving and you're like is that first to
happen I don't think that's supposed to
happen and my friend jasmine was like
it's a Michaels and like get in my house
and then like right out would run up and
jump on it and it would like still be
there it's just really creepy and the
candles always used to go up like the
flames you still got like this high as
you can see right now the flame would
like literally come up past this and if
that happens usually there's like a
ghost in the house I'm just like that's
scary why doing that why you're playing
with me every single time I would sleep
there would be in her room and she has
like a really long creaky hallway when
you walk on an old creak and all of a
sudden every night it just starts
creaking like someone's walking down
towards the hallway getting closer to
the bedroom so obviously that scared the
 out of me would always like hide
under the blankets it was like
horrifying Leah and she always used to
wake people up in dreams and be like the
outline or the face of the old lady
would be in people's dreams and with the
night I think that was maybe a sign to
like get them out of the house that
didn't happen to me personally but it
happened to her cousin so like we all
knew like that wasn't all baby because
of that like what and then the last like
creepy thing that happened to me was I
did the Ouija board which I know is
something that you're not supposed to do
if you guys have like looked up Ouija
board challenges or whatever on YouTube
they're pretty scary
so I did a Ouija board with my brother
we did it at like out three old houses
ago so basically what you do is you put
your fingers on a shot glass and you
talk to spirits and they you have like a
to Zed on a piece of wood and then you
have like yes or no and then numbers and
it pretty much just like spells
everything out Lou and it moves like
when it first started I was like calm
like you're moving this aren't you
because this is so scary
why are you making me do this I'm
 grade seven I'm freaking out and
I already had this
like weird gross experience at my
friend's house so he's like no no it's
not me trust me like ask a question that
you don't know and I was like okay so
what's my teacher's name and it wrote my
teacher's name I'm like okay that's like
definitely no that's the spirit because
my brother wouldn't know that and
then I started asking questions like
like who's going to be my first kiss and
it wrote my boyfriend at the time which
by the way it wasn't my first kiss so
you're wrong mate and then I was like am
I going to win a champion and it said
yes and I won a champion I was like the
best thing ever
um and then I was like the whole time I
was like oh my god oh my god this is so
scary
and my brothers like you know how to say
God because um he doesn't like that word
and seven or something and I'm like well
I mean thank God the whole time
so am I going to die
so my mom got home and we need to like
cut it off and I went to get up and he's
like no you have to make sure that you
sign off with the ghost otherwise I can
stick by you forever so I was okay can
we go now and then I'm pretty sure he
went - no and I was like freaking out
and then eventually we asked again and
he's like yes so we left so then my mum
well my mum went to a psychic um I would
say two weeks ago and I don't know if
you guys believe in this stuff but I
totally believe in it so cool um and
they said that there is a spirit
following me every where I go so
right now probably hope you start
senseless yet because I'm I'm alone
right now probably there is a man
apparently in his like mid-20s just over
my shoulder me um so yeah the
psychic said that I need to go in to
kind of like say my goodbyes to him so
he starts following me and stuff but
yeah that is like four fucked-up things
that have happened to me in my life um
nothing
obviously like crazy and life-changing
like oh we're actually happened do you
like just normal things that have
happened to me that probably happened to
you before as well so I hope you guys
liked this story time video I saw would
be fun to like kind of sit down and chat
with you guys about things that have
happened to me and yeah I hope you guys
