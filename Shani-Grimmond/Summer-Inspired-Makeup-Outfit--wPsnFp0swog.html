so excited to go shopping guys I love
shopping it's like my favorite thing
ever so now when I apply some blush I'm
just using the NYX shade in angel this
is such a pretty shade except it's all
cracked so it's so hard to use just like
goes on a big chunk so I have to be
really careful okay so I'm just going to
put this at the back of my cheekbones
just up here
so now I'm going to contour and using
the hoola benefit bronzer and I got this
off eBay for like $2 and actually works
so good for my bronzer so I'm loving
that
so now I'm just going to highlight using
my Mac mineralize skinfinish and soften
gentle and I'm just putting this on the
top of my cheekbones up here
so now I'm just going to powder my face
down using the hello fullest benefit
powder in the shade honey and I'm just
going to focus this on the outside of my
face and hopefully my foundation stays
on all day now well moving on to eyes
I'm just going to put a base down I'm
just using the Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre I'm just going to put this all
over my lid so my eyeshadow stays on all
day
now taking my humungous new palette and
I'm just going to be taking this chair
right here just a really pretty peachy
pink kind of shade and I have no idea
where I'm going with this look so don't
mind me if it turns out as a disaster so
I'm just going to pack this color all
over my lid and you guys should let me
know ways are all from in the comments
below that would be fantastic
good to know don't then I don't know
what to chat about going seriously
so just to warm up the crease of it I'm
just going to be taking this warm brown
shade right here and I'm just going to
put that through the crease
you
I'm just going to highlight using this
shade here I'm just going to put that on
top of my brow bone
whoo Oh actually I should put something
into my bottom lash line so it's not
dead I'm just going to take this darker
peach shade right here and put that
under my lash line so it's not plain
under there oh my eyes are so sensitive
today again oh my goodness I'm just
going to put some nude eyeliner in my
waterline to make my eyes appear a bit
bigger and the aircon is blowing in my
eyes so it really flopping it whoa
my goodness oh so now taking my favorite
mascara by Maybelline I'm just going to
coat this all over my lashes
you
I feel like on all out today I'm going
to apply some fake lashes and these are
the red cherry ones in the number four
one five and I'm just going to put some
lash glue on a flat surface just so it
gets tacky and dries a bit and while
that's drying I'm going to fill my
eyebrows in using my Sigma medium brow
powder if I can open it and I'm just
taking my little angled Sigma brush as
well I'm just going to start at the tail
and work my way forwards and this is why
I really concentrate so I don't think I
can chitchat too much here
okay so can you guys tell this one has
an arch and this one's so much higher so
I don't know how to fix that there's
nothing I can do so I'm just going to
work with it
so I'm just going to apply some lipstick
and this is the lone crime lipstick I
just got this and I'm so obsessed with
it other than the fact that it doesn't
really stay on for too long so I just
have to keep reapplying but this isn't a
shade babe it and it's really pretty
peachy pink color so I'm just going to
put that on what
if you guys know of any good Lancome
lipsticks please let me know because I
really want to start making a little oh
collection of these months okay so now
I'm just going to apply my fake lashes
and now that the glue is tacky I'm just
going to coat the lashes with glue and
then put them on with some tweezers and
the better body stick because they never
do no lashes I ever put on stick will
see what am I going to do with my life
but literally took 10 minutes to apply
one lash let's give it a go it's never
going to work

years later now that my eyelashes have
actually gone on and dried I'm going to
put my jewelry on and this watches from
