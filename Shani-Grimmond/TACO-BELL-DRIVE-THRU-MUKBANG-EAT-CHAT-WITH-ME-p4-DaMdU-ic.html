I literally just got a message from a

just not okay I'm just gonna have a
nibble with my phalanges and then go
back to the talker oh oh oh my cool
that's that's amazing
no I shouldn't come here now I'm gonna
come here all the time with sorry um not
that I'm healthy is it what's a solid
okay so a lot of you have been asking me
to touch base on like my anxiety and
like how it's going lately um to be
honest like I've documented a lot of my
anxiety I've spoken about it quite a bit
um I've even put a video up where I
actually had a little bit of an anxiety
attack like I was out you know with like
a bunch of influences for like a brand
and I literally just had to leave
because it was just I just had the
biggest like anxiety attack and I'm like
I'm sorry I can't be here like any time
I get anxious like I've got a guard and
if I can't guard I will flip out like
I'm sure you guys know what I'm talking
about if you have experienced like
anxiety before whatever there's
definitely different lived levels of it
that time was pretty bad but like for
the past few months I literally haven't
had it I think what happened was there
was this trip that I was going to go on
and I was so anxious to go on it and I
was just like mmm I was like I need to
push myself to go even though I'm
starting about like flying by
myself and everything but I was like I'm
just gonna guard I'm gonna push pasta
and maybe this is gonna help my anxiety
in the long run and it did I went there
and I realized
people just as anxious as um like some
of the time people are just as shy as
you well some of the time like people
are literally going through the same
 that you're going through sir
doesn't know there's no reason to be
scared because people are people exactly
the same as you like it was no reason to
be intimidated at all that just like
everyone on that trip that I went was so
kind and like from then on I've been
like wow why I scared all the time till
I meet new people who go to new events
like why so I don't know ever since then
I've just think sorry oh my god I've
calmly run into me I'm listening sir
carefree and like just happy and like
just I've gotten rid of like all the
people in my life that aren't want there
for me not just focus on my close
friends and rather have a problem of him
feeling anxious they're there for me
John is there for me like just like
everyone in my life I'm just so content
with at the moment and I think that's
like another reason why I'm just like so
insert content sorry I don't I don't
know I just haven't been anxious I mean
I definitely get split so that and like
that's fine but I audio I feel like I
don't how to calm myself down and I just
like to get out of the situation and
also sometimes it's not to always the
other situation it's to push yourself
through it if you feel like you can if
you're not going to have a mental
breakdown oh my god I'm so full mmm
still sleepy while eating Taco Bell
someone said on Twitter on t there's no
money there's not really much you can
say on YouTube without getting in
trouble
no gonna lie I was gonna do a video I
mean not getting in trouble but I just
don't want to lack I don't want to say
anything about anyone not that I have
anything to say I'm just saying like if
I ever had beef with anyone or whatever
I'm not gonna talk about it like I would
have heard some positive things I've
under everyone so obsessed with like tea
and like drama but I mean maybe it
distracts you from your life but closing
drummer's is not a positive lifestyle
ain't gonna be talking about
anybody I was gonna be doing I was gonna
do a video judging not judging I was
going to
giving my opinion on people's Coachella
outfits people calling car chiller
outfits I was gonna do it but I'm like
okay first of all there's a few ways you
can look at it everyone has their own
style and they're entitled to give their
own opinion about whatever they wear a
few outfits like I obviously wouldn't
wear myself and I'd obviously say that
in the video but then I'm like wait a
second imagine if that person was
watching the video and then they had me
or like whatever other youtuber say that
they don't like their outfit like yeah I
know people can say whatever they want
but like I would never want anyone to be
upset with anything I say so I'm just
like no I'm not kind of do that like
obviously I don't have problem with like
those videos I'm just saying like oh my
god that's so entertaining to watch but
I personally am NOT I I couldn't do it I
don't think all I had was like a few
chips and hot taco sorry I don't it's
not very satisfying to watch usually I
like like watching people that a peep
anyways there's one more thing that I
wanted to talk about before I go um I
it's kind of sad and I don't want to
black be a downer but I just really want
to talk about it because it's so
important so close to my heart
um I was watching a documentary I was so
much a documentary with 60 minutes on TV
so it's basically like the news and
though talking about wonder good time to
babe honey relax
though talking about bullying and me and
my little shell like I am so aware of
like cyberbullying I know how bad it is
I know that it's getting so much worse
but I didn't realize bullying at school
and stuff was so bad nowadays like when
I was in high school I don't know if
it's just was like quizzes at school I
went to but I didn't have any bullying
at my school that I knew of luckily but
a lot of my friends said that they got
bullied in high school and it's just
it's horrible but it did come to my
attention that bullying is becoming a
lot worse nowadays and I just want you
guys to know that I'm here if you need
to talk your parents are here like don't
be afraid to talk to your parents if
you're having any problems at school
work or wherever you are
just make sure you speak up because the
last thing that I want is to lose any of
you guys or any of my friends or
anything like that that would honestly
just please please please please speak
to someone if you are
what was that I get scared from
everything to speak to someone if you're
going through a hard time because it
will make so much difference you can get
help
not that there's anything wrong with you
but you know it's not bad to get some
guidance and just stop the bullies I
literally had to leave Taco Bell because
these true guys roughed up and they were
trying to park right next to me and I
swear to God they were like this close
to my car like they nearly hit it look
here I have insurance in this car but I
don't have time today what are we
hitting it
oh I guess that's the end of the video
right I'm hitting them back to
Jonathan's right now because he's going
to pick up a new car I think he's like
that's my longer to his house ready 1 2
