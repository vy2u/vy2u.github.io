vlog on my channel so I'm in London
right now I flew here yesterday I think
me and Ronnie were on the plane for like
two days honestly like I think this is a
longest flight in the world from
Australia sorry what I'm sorry happy to
be here I just opened the window and
Ronnie just realized how freezing it is
it I think it's like true to great today
I just look at the weather but um
wheyhey out with a friend that would
birth me working with for a while now
Glasson so I was shooting the new range
which I'm so excited about because the
clothes are amazing I can't wait to
share them with you
sorry pretty much this whole trip will
be taking like really cool photos and
like filming a bit me and Ronnie a
fighting over the window being open and
she wants to close oh wow there's people
looking in so this is Ronnie everyone if
you haven't met her here she is she
looks like an ad well sir tonight I did
like very full crazy glam actually like
a cranberry smokey eye because I mean
it's cold so my makeups not gonna sweat
off so I'm like I may as well go all out
I would show you the room but honestly
like it looks like a bombs hit it yeah
tell ok this is like my favorite
earrings right yeah face it's on yes and
Michael operated a video of me and they
said like the main focus point and
someone said it was a scissoring potato
earrings and I was like oh my god that's
so ugly Oh Ron you know I have
completely different tastes but when I'm
with her I adapt to her style a little
bit so you know what by the industry
well probably not very dirty and I'm
funny I'm listening I'll probably be
writing this potato earrings honestly
this is our little room here and here's
a few I can't believe how many buildings
are jam-packed in London it's actually
crazy great without turn around I was
going to show you okay first of all boom
okay so we just left our hotel this is
the street by saying I'm just saying
right there
so pretty so refreshing out here hey yes
up ways right next to us
subway like no wait show me your outfit
you can very stylish today I love that
car so cute
I'm not too sure like where the cafes
are but we're just gonna have a stroll
maybe down this street just see what's
poppin you know six degrees that's
actually not bad
it's like perfect balance all right guys
so we just got our coffee we got some
free muffins on the side I'm pretty
happy with that never ask me I don't
need raspberries oh well we're just give
it a try - I think it looks so cute wait
turn that side yeah like this like that
okay we're just swear now first okay
Chanel be kind of very cute Joel and
we're like okay metonic style these hats
we've been trying all morning we don't
know how to wear them guys oh oh my God
look that bird is so English we
destroyed out of his house at its lane
allotments this to disk
right I think we got our first we're on
Oxford Street right now I think which is
art I think so I think it's like the
Main Street is this like the mainstream
shopping like I'm not sure
fine so we just went shopping and why
would that work out well asking one of
the work is like where we should go for
farters and he said yeah we said work
Avenue Station so I just can't attack
see then get something cool pics
um I need to get part of it make sense
really yeah sure but you know what the
one thing is that's like really annoying
about Ryan is you walk into like the
shop and it's really hot and you're
outside it's freezing so you can't ever
be like comfortable it's like really
hard you like it's outside of sight so
how are you welcome to the shop and it's
like crazy yeah so it's like twisted
yeah you know
that taxi driver literally just said be
really careful when you're like on your
phone because people ride paths on
motorbikes and snatch out of your hair
and I was like holy lucky he told
us because my back's like literally
wider right now so it looks just I've
had the pickpocketing is like really bad
in here
sorry it's nice to story that now we
just found these cute little buildings
here I think you're gonna take up first
outfit shot here and then we can go
explore up okay sorry we just got this
mat delivered to our room it's a what
even is this again so it actually says
it's a martini Bianca yeah yeah they
just brought it to us and said it's from
the hotel you can seal the close-knit
Omaha League yep and we're like it good
oh it smells pretty strong but I feel
like I get absolutely off that
what do you think it's strong hey I
actually think it's pretty good what do
you think what is that experience word I
think it's general something no oh my
god
rum it's wrong Jack Daniels oh you know
what if we go out tonight or tomorrow
night yeah we'll put this in the fridge
and then we'll have it then because I
feel like it's really just gonna get you
going
we have no idea where we are we just
apparently this restaurants really nice
so we just got in a taxi to go to
breakfast we're going to a restaurant
called Luke oh wait where we going
thank you it's called aqua chard it's
like a female's way yeah I think so
building saw and there's a London I just
that we didn't go there off dry feet
and I go to everyone jokes yeah
Chinese outfit today very key
I love the jacket sorry wall I'm so sad
because we have to book to eat here
because it's branch we miss breakfast
but look beautiful the view is if you
guys are ever coming to London
definitely check this place out back was
shot yeah we made it to the London Eye
this area is so beautiful there's a lot
of people lining up there so I don't
know how long that way it would be I'm
feeling would be at least an hour
I'm sorry happy that it's not as cold as
yesterday I think it's because the sun's
out it's like really nice weather today
yeah we just gonna have a look around
see see what's happened
wow that's really fast and like dramatic
like relax like I'd be vomiting
everywhere the street is so beautiful
holy
since our oil isn't it so I'm just in a
taxi and Ronnie was saying how this mole
oh yeah there's like volcano reason
Australia there is humans like the
population raises like double humans
like in what states like in Northern
Territory and sorry might like no one is
all over because I think of how might
think of the middle of Australia yeah
which is like doesn't yeah and like Bush
