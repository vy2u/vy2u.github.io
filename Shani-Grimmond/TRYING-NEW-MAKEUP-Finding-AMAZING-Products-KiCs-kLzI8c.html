channel sorry in today's video I'm gonna
be trying out a bunch of makeup that I
have never used before so a whole face
of first impressions one of my favorite
videos to film because I love playing
around with makeup so don't forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and let's go ahead and get
started the first thing that I'm going
to do and the thing that I never like
change up is priming my eyes just
because I find it so important when it
comes to like putting the eyeshadow on
top that the actual primer is good so
I'm just gonna go put on my eyes and and
I'll be right back oh my god do you guys
remember this song because ISIL Italy be
obsessed with it ready okay let's move
on to the eye shadow I'm super excited
about this one so this is the Marc
Jacobs eyeshadow palette in 7:20 and the
shade that I'm gonna take is in famous
so it's this one right here I feel like
this is going to be a really nice
transition shade it's it's very unique
it's not like a typical brown it has a
little bit of like I feel like it has
pink undertones in it oh no it's like
it's really nice so I'm just gonna blend
that in my crease with my Mac true to
full brush so because this is a very
light shade I'm really just gonna go
crazy
and take it in windshield wiper motions
I'm gonna love it so far I put it on my
eyes for like three seconds and I'm like
oh my god yes but I actually really like
the formula super pigmented next up
we're gonna take the shade seeking this
cool tone Brown right here and that's
going pretty much in the same place as
the last color but this is going to
deepen it up a little bit to you as a
fly they always come out to play when
might be glad sauron you know Marie
fright oh these are blending like I
dream as well it's so funny because
every time I film my eyeshadow always
feel me doing the other eye is weird and
then I'm just gonna go back over with
that original transition shade and blend
out the edge
is just the basic you know next up I'm
gonna take this grainy emerald color
right here and I'm gonna pop that on my
outer corner and I might point it into
my crease let's just see how we go I
haven't done green on the eyes and so
long in this color is stunning
I might put this in my crease just a
tiny bit
it's nothing dramatic but it's still a
nice pop of color like it's still
different so I'm gonna make sure to keep
that underneath the brown that we have
in the crease let's move on to the fun
part so let's go in with some gel liner
this one's from Inglot and it's in the
shade 94 this is like a beautiful taupe
evesham painting Goldy kind of color and
I'm just gonna do a little cut crease
1/2 cut crease and by the way soon I'm
gonna get a separate camera so you guys
can see what's happening closer out
because this isn't working for me but I
also you mean for now Michael told me to
mix a little bit of the Jura line from
Inglot in that eyeliner just a tiny bit
that's so pretty it's nice and soft
and then straight over the top we're
going in with this that lit cosmetics
champagne wishes this is like a little
glitter that is sorry pretty okay I'm
just gonna try and blend the green in
with that looks good okay so let's move
on to the primer for now I'm gonna take
this one from Tom Ford it is the
complexion enhancing a primer I'm gonna
put three pumps on the back of my hand
and blend it in oh it feels beautiful
goodness oh you know that's expensive
dilt okay so it's time for the
foundation and I'm gonna take this one
from lemare it is in the shade shale um
this is Michael's color so I have no
idea if this is gonna even like work but
I'll give it a shot look sorry pink
that's not gonna work that is not going
to work click nope
it matches my natural skin tone nicely
but damn it I have an idea so I've used
this product like once or twice before
but I kind of forget how it goes so it
is the nas what even is this called a
Velvet Matte foundation stick in the
shade Barcelona I'm pretty sure I liked
it when I used it last time it just
wasn't like very full coverage but let's
see I'll just pull lots on oh just like
the wads on top of that primer like yeah
see it's like a nice natural finish in
coverage I feel like I don't really need
much coverage anyway like there's no way
I mean we had a cover the lots of my
pimples but at least the redness has
gone from them next thing is concealer
and this one's gonna be so lie like I'm
actually skin it is the taut rainforest
of the sea from concealer in the shade
fail light like I already know it's
gonna be truly am I called the one
destroy big I mean it's blending up
beautifully under my eyes I think I
might get this in my shade actually okay
start to set that down I'm going in with
the Maybelline fit me loose finishing
powder in 0-5 alright I don't even know
if this is new you I've never heard of
it but I'm excited to try this one
let's bake under there and once you're
gonna bake oh wait Neuros gonna bake my
laugh lines I'm skit it's gonna leave a
white cost and I don't want to want cast
on my life lines next up we have the
powder for the face so this is the it
cosmetics your skin but better CC
airbrushing perfecting powder the names
really freaking long sorry these ones in
the shade light
i rated michael's covered under why did
that because nothing is matching me
well my foundation is like coming off
why
okay we need to dust away anything
that's under the eyes so just like a
testy own or it is a white costume oh I
tried to put like a foundation powder
under my eyes to cover like where the
foundation and concealer lifted but it's
not really covering sorry that's just
annoying I'm not using that patter again
everyone's asking me if I have cheap
filler you know I don't have cheek Phila
I've never had anything in my face
except for my lips to like enhance my
pages okay so I'm gonna do the lower
lash line now and I'm just gonna go in
with that dark brown and put that from
outer corner to inner corner so we can
even a breath them out mothers like so
much into my eyes like it's actually
freaking me out I'm also just gonna put
a little bit of the green under there as
well just a little bit closer to the
lash line but I'm just gonna put this on
the at off huh oh my god that is sorry
pigmented
okay sorry for the eyeliner I'm taking
this a makeup geek full spectrum
eyeliner pencil in the shade nude so I'm
just gonna line my waterline I mean I
feel like it's not loud enough it's kind
of like the same color as my waterline
naturally sir I mean it's alright but
nothing special I'm just gonna quickly
go ahead and add some lashes and I'll be
right back oh my god I've got makeup
here okay so let's move on to the bronze
I just put my lashes on and it looks so
much better now I'm loving it I'm hoping
that the glitter and the greens like
blended enough together every time I
grab I can edit my videos I'm like did I
even freaking bull win my eyeshadow so
annoying but now let's move on yet to
bronze I already said that relax okay
call a pulp this is what even is this I
mean it doesn't even say like what it is
that's a bit weird but it comes with a
bronzer and a highlight
I'm thinking this might be the Alexus
rent and collaboration I'm not too sure
but let's supply it we're gonna take a
big-ass brush and we're going to stop
running the face I feel like this is
gonna be amazing
just because it's so like orange turning
so warm turn I love that oh I'm also
gonna take this down my neck as well and
under my jewel burn around my hairline
just with my face powder I'm going to
clean up my bronzer as you do this is a
light color so it's gonna work perfectly
for the blush today we're gonna take
this one from Oprah this is in the shade
punch oh my god that is so intense like
are we actually serious right now
I'm just gonna touch it a tiny bit oh my
god that's so pigmented and then put
that on the apples of my cheeks I don't
want to be like really intense but I
just want a little flush oh yeah that's
pretty
hey Mikey we'd have to grab some more
earth for blushes oh my gosh I'm so
excited for this sir I'm gonna go in
with the Maybelline master chrome
highlighter this is in the shade 100
this is like a beautiful gold color and
it looks so beautiful lack are you
kidding me so I'm just gonna take that
on my Anastacio a 23 brush another oh
wow I really like that
you've just gotta build it out this the
only thing which I think is good because
then you can have it like I'm really
lack um sorry this is distracting me
that's so pretty you can have like a
really subtle glow or you can have it
really dramatic it melts into the skin
nicely like it doesn't look chalky or
anything very impressed okay so I just
found this wet and wild liquid lipstick
I have a feeling it's something way to
newry but I'm just gonna try yeah it's
actually brown that's disgusting I found
a new liquid lipstick that I haven't
used before this one's from Astralis it
is in the shade creme brulee this is
what it looks like right here what's
going oh my gosh it smells like
bubblegum
YUM it is a little bit thin I have a
feeling I might have to do it
oh no that's nice might have to a few
coats sorry I would say if you have a
lighter skin tone than me then this will
look really nice on you but I'm gonna
say it's to you laughs me I might just
have to mix a little bit of huda beauty
Venus I always say who da oh I always
say who da ba i said who da and it
sounded really weird it just didn't
sound right oh the last step is the
Oprah makeup fixer light mist so because
my eyebrows tattooed on I have to cover
them just like for the first week oh my
gosh you really reason why I wore this
jacket is to cover like that line right
there and you can friggin see it still
oh my god I feel like that's rich
there's a little doge like it's alright
and it was pretty good but I felt like a
big few chunks but I didn't leave any
white spots sorry not complaining I take
that back it's actually good okay so we
have finished with the makeup look I
actually love how it looks but like
let's do a rundown of every single
product so first of all the foundation
is looking very cakey around this area
right here this area right here I like
my laugh lines are seriously so thick I
did have to put a lot on just to get
like a nice medium to full coverage but
I don't know I feel like I'm gonna wear
the foundation all the time just because
it feels so nice on the skin it doesn't
feel heavy at all it leaves a beautiful
finish it's just like all that cakiness
around there so maybe next time I use it
I'm gonna make my my laugh lines oh my
gosh the liquid lipstick is literally so
sticky like I'm I've tried to let it dry
but my lips are sticking together let me
just say those Marc Jacobs eyeshadows
were incredible if you guys haven't
tried them you should definitely do it
I've got a few other palettes here that
I'm gonna play around with and film with
it so you guys can see some more light
colors it comes in the other palettes
things lit cosmetics glitter is sari
good if you guys don't have any of these
definitely grab this one in the in the
yeah it showed birthday wishes I'm gonna
go online literally right now and grew
by a million of these because I'm so
impressed like is areas but yeah
