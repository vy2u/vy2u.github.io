woke up a few hours ago and I decided to
clean the house because I hate starting
a weekend with the messy house oh that's
a bloody ages so now it's finally time
to go eat some breakfast
his little Lulu she's growing up so
quickly what I'm seriously having an
issue with her like she is not weighing
on her pee mat so I'm really sick and
tired of playing at pappu butt and
hopefully she gets the hang of it soon I
don't know this house is just so small I
really want to moving it look at the
massive backyard and stuff but gotta
keep saving because houses aren't cheap
these days I know and we can never
forget little Ben Ben yeah yeah so the
plan right now is to do my makeup and
get ready because I'm starving we need
to go eat so I just finished my makeup
and if any of you guys are wondering
Jonathan's not going to be in its log
because he has gone back home at so he
flew back home yesterday to rockhampton
which is like a few hours away so he
won't be back till Sunday 9 which really
sad about last night I look how will
tear drop down my face because like we
never spend any time apart so I'm not
really used to him not being here
yeah what are you doing hauls you're
doing your hair it looks so pretty
you're doing some hair up some hair down
or
what are you doing oh you're so cute I
love you what you want to do today guys
hit the bowling pin you want to go to
the bowling pin
I'm so excited let's do it so this is
what I'm wearing to go get brookie it's
just like a little blue jumpsuit it's
super comfortable I only wear a
comfortable clothes I hate won't
anything uncomfortable I am so excited
so in two weeks I'm going to Indonesia a
few different islands there and I'm
going to be vlogging the whole thing I'm
so excited I've looked at the places I'm
going on Google and they look
amazing like so blue the water crystal
clear and there's gonna be like fun
activities there and stuff I just cannot
wait like I'm overdue for a holiday and
I love vlogging while I'm traveling
because it's like paradise and it's
always fun to just travel the world and
document it at the same time I
underestimated how freaking cold it is
today I'm freezing I hate winter already
I want it to be hot in summary so I go
to the beach so just doing a little bit
of shopping now I'm like addicted to
shopping it's not even funny oh that's
cute little broiler really picky dough
so it's kind of I never really get much
but I'm always shopping hello beanie
who's excited
Debbie's home hello lil fatty but can
you put this in the microwave for 30
seconds Shankill so I ended up getting a
really healthy sausage roll or pie so as
most of you guys know if you follow me
on instagram i've been getting sick like
so much it's freaking annoying right and
my diet isn't good at all like i eat a
lot of junk food but the main thing i
need to cut out is just like chocolate
and lollies because i have like a sweet
tooth for that um so don't already
 it hey babe um so a lot of
people have been telling me to go vegan
but right now i'm not going to go vegan
i'm not going to go vegetarian
i'm very aware of what happens to
animals i have watched a lot of
freelee's videos so i'm i do know quite
a lot about it um
I'm just not interested in going vegan
right now and I don't mean to say that
to hurt anyone's feelings it's just my
it's just like what I want to do it's my
life and I'm choosing not to go vegan
and I really do 100% like I appreciate
everyone that is vegan obviously um I
don't know it's just not something that
I want to do right now because obviously
it is a lifestyle going vegan it changes
a lot
I don't eat healthy at all and if I was
to go vegan I would not eat much at all
so I don't know how that would go for me
maybe one day in the future I'll try it
out like I'm not completely closing it
off that idea I mean more than half of
the population is not vegan so I don't
think I'm a completely shitty person for
not being vegan oh but maybe one day
guys I don't know okay so now it is time
at to watch some YouTube guru I have so
many year someone stopped by
holy crap guys I need to talk about this
package that I got yesterday so this is
from Lily lashes aka Lilly ghalichi look
how freaking amazing these lashes are
like I've never seen anything so perfect
in my life okay
close up time it looks so long and
fluffy I love how they all wispy at the
end like they kind of look a bit
I don't know messy like that's the look
that I love oh my god here's another
pair they get really dramatic like
there's so many different styles you can
choose from like oh I cannot wait to try
these out like they honestly look like
the previous lashes I've ever seen in my
life so now it is time to take my
vitamins these make me better
it's like for my meat system that's so
disgusting you gotta have three at a
time and Haley you have to have them as
well barb because since I'm sick I don't
you to get sick - if I have these okay I
have three of the first tablet Paley how
many do you have - okay look students
ready let's show them how gross they are
you have to chew them as well makes it
even worse they kinda have an orange
flavor bottom right Haley go vomit no go
move a little more
I honestly tasted disgusting
I really vomited but then the tablets
that I've like made me get over my cold
they're cold this is what they are we'll
definitely recommend them because it may
be getting my flu in like a day I don't
know what the hell they are but you get
them from the chemist I have a feeling
there might be a little bit of like
fighting in the comments because of like
what I said about vegans and that I
don't eat healthy and stuff but honestly
it's my body and
no one should really care about what I
put into my body you should care about
what you put into your body so yeah so
we are at pool now and oh my god it is
honestly the nicest weather I can't see
a thing these honey's not even like
fixing anything absolutely perfect day

a little bit cold in there though so

have to do in repayment

a while ago um they're literally like 15
dollars or something I love them it's so

hair when I put trash shampoo and it
just goes absolutely crazy but I
honestly caught expressed you guys how
excited I am to just travel after

doing collabs to be honest collapse make
me really uncomfortable I don't
know why where else but I want to go I'm
gonna go to New York
