happy to be sitting down and filming a
video because I've been away for the
past a week so it feels amazing to be
back I went to the Maldives and I got a
natural tan for once in my lap how I
haven't got a real tan in the longest
time so I'm really happy about that
sorry in today's video I'm doing a first
impression and review on the new Tarte
shaped tape foundations there is a
hydrating foundation and also a matte
foundation and these top shape
concealers have been that my favorite
concealers literally ever since the day
I got my hands on them they're amazing
so full coverage they don't look cakey
they're just these are the best
concealers in the world so I'm really
really excited to try these out and see
if they're just as good as the concealer
I mean it's gonna be hard but we're
gonna find out today I'm gonna leave my
makeup on for the entire day and I'll
keep coming back with you got keep luck
and I'll keep coming back every few
hours or so to let you guys know how it
goes on my skin so we'll be trying out
the hydrating and the matte foundation
one on each side so I mean we're really
gonna see if it's gonna cover up all
these pimples oh I've never had
breakouts this bad well I mean I haven't
since I was in high school so I'm like
so upset about it but at least we can
see if it's high coverage
okay so I gave one of the shades to
Michael so I'm hoping the others are my
shades so it comes with a sponge and
also a brush right here and the
foundations are let me just see how much
fifty four Australian dollars which i
think is pretty reasonable for like a
high-end product that's pretty much you
know standard just so you guys know I
did get this sent to me but that does
not make this review any different - if
I was to purchase them so obviously I'm
gonna be as honest as they would be if
they paid with Maori money I don't know
I don't really want to use the brush
that it comes with just cuz I couldn't
have really use these and I want to use
the Beauty Blender just so I know
exactly how the foundation works and
it's not gonna be changed like my
opinion might be changed by these
products or I'm thinking I will use
these in another video I think just cuz
like we're really gonna focus on the
actual foundation
video because I need to see it's okay
sorry I'm gonna read out what it says on
the website about this foundation so we
can learn a little bit about it so it
says it is a vegan oil-free a full
coverage foundation with a creamy
texture and a modern matte finish to
complement your cult favorite concealer
that is really high expectations like if
it's comparing itself to the concealer
like wow it provides the same coverage
as the concealer Wow it smooths over
pores and imperfections with rich
airbrush full coverage that to rise into
a matte finish using a unique concealer
inspired wand that's cool I like when
they have the ones but if you have
breakouts it's not really good is it
because you're whacking it on the
conundrum breakout I'll just go around
it it's fine the formula absorbs oil and
shine while leaving at skin creaseless
that's a big statement creases because I
got the worst laugh lines right here
hydrated at free of flakiness or
cockiness and helps improve skin health
with every application Wow interesting
Tarte tip because the formula is so full
coverage you want to be sure that you
have the right shade for your complexion
I feel like that was written for me
because I I never get the shade right
but I have I have like two can choose
from three for the matte why we love it
dermatologist tested hyper allergenic
waterproof long wet waterproof
cheeese this long way vegan oil-free
talc free alcohol-free okay that's cool
okay so let's go in and apply the
foundation so I have two shades right
here for the matte foundations I have
medium tan honey and tan honey so I
think I'm gonna try a medium tan honey
first because I think that's yeah that's
lighter all right so I'm gonna do the
matte on this side actually no I'm gonna
do the matte on this side just because
there's so many more breakouts and I
feel like the matte might be a little
bit more full coverage
okay so just gave it a good shake it
comes with the same kind of applicator
as like the clinic Foundation and the
top shape tip concealer so I'm really
really quite happy about that I'm just
concerned because I can't wear it
anywhere near that let's just go in oh
that comes nice
okay I'm so excited for this oh my gosh
oh my gosh that is sorry full coverage
my first impression I'm really impressed
I don't want to tell my neck that call
is pretty good as well
I can't believe this is actually
happening like the taught shape tape
foundation came out what the hell
if this isn't my favorite foundation in
the world I'm gonna be so sad I'm
actually so shocked right now
I haven't seen any other reviews so I
don't know what other people think about
which I'm really happy about because I
don't want my opinion to be like changed
by anyone elses but okay I'm creasing
like straight-up that's like so normal
for me but I cannot believe how
beautiful that looks on my skin I knew I
would like the matte one better even
though I haven't even used that I drew
anyone that looks amazing it just looks
so it looks so light like it doesn't
even look like I have any foundation on
except for that crazy please go away but
like it oh the finish is so beautiful
I'm gonna go in with the medium tan
honey on the other side as well I did
notice that the hydrating and the matte
formulas have a little touch of a
difference with the color range because
I went to give Michael birth foundation
so he couldn't do it review as well and
the true shades were a little bit
different one was more pink one was more
yellow sir
hopefully they're okay I'm gonna have to
blend that down my neck a little bit but
I really really love the color of that
one it's nice and neutral shade it's not
too yellow all right let's do the other
side all right I feel like enough
product kind of comes out on the
applicator for me just because I have
places very much um foundation unless
you really like to smell it around it
does alright let's see how the hydrating
side is gonna go I'm just gonna use the
other side of my Beauty Blender
hmm okay very first thought this is not
as full coverage as the Matt one I knew
that would happen because I can still
see the redness of this breakout right
here that one and that one but on this
side you can only kind of like see the
bumps all that creases you know this
one's kind of like a little bit blotchy
as well see as you can see right now I
have the same lights on both side of my
face and you can see this one's
reflecting a lot more light and this
one's just like completely matte now
let's try it down really nicely so this
one is amazing I don't even think I
really like this one to be honest it's
very wet I'm gonna go in with more
product to see if it adds a little bit
more coverage oh my god sent over my
pimple that is sort of bad so it's gonna
be like you alright let's see how this
looks
yeah it's definitely not building up to
like a full coverage on this side it is
a really nice like you know light to
medium coverage though okay sir I'm
gonna take my necklaces off so I can
blend like some runs it down my neck so
it matches perfectly but right now I'm
just gonna go in with the top shape take
concealer in the shade light/medium and
I'm just going to put this under my eyes
just to conceal and then I'm gonna go do
my makeup off camera and oh what I think
on how everything like blends out I just
want to see how this product blends out
over the top of the foundation that
looks amazing over the matte side I just
can't believe how well like it covered
over my breakouts I'm sorry about I did
the matte on that side because a
hydrating side would look sorry okay I
know my pimples I just had some of my
iron tablets and all these other
vitamins and I can feel it coming back a
bit smokers Oh before I go I just want
to give you guys a little close-up of
what the foundation looks like so this
one is the hydrating side it still does
look very beautiful really fresh and
light
on the face and then we have the matte
side right here which i think is more of
like the you know makeup that you'd wear
at clubbing like the full coverage matte
look it's not too matte doesn't make my
face look cakey still have a nice
reflection through here which I love
yeah let me know what foundation you
guys like better in the comments no see
you in a second I'm gonna go do the rest
of my makeup okay so my makeup is done
and I didn't put any lipstick on and
last time I did that everyone's like
what happened to our lips where are they
well the filler is pretty much going out
of my lip so let's see how the face
looks so my overall opinion on like the
first application the hydrating side was
like a little bit blotchy in this area
here I'm not sure what happened there
why that even happened cuz I don't know
I feel like that wouldn't happen if I
did it again it was just like my luck
for the first time the coverage is
really beautiful obviously a little tiny
bit of a lot of coverage then this side
I would feel like this is more of like
an everyday foundation and I feel like
the matte one is when you want like a
full glam like clubbing kind of look I
absolutely love the way the matte
foundation looks it looks incredible
this side really reminds me of the
finish of the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and that one is my favorite
foundation so that's a good start
so I guess everything's gonna come down
through how it kind of lost on my skin
what happens throughout the day so yeah
I'm really impressed with both of the
products this one is especially as you
guys would know by now but I'm here I
feel like all the products that I put on
over the top this side looked a little
bit better by the end of it it did at
this side as well decided like
everything applied really nicely over
the top and under I just feel like this
one looks like a little bit better even
though there's like a little break
that's on this side like oh yeah I'll
get back to you guys very very soon so
it is five o'clock in the afternoon now
so I guess I'm gonna have to have the
makeup on like all day
oh not color guys sir
it's 11 o'clock at night it's been 6
hours and I'm sorry if you can't I
so I thought I'm not in the middle so I
thought I'd come back and see how my
makeup look sorry I haven't looked in
the mirror yet I'm excited to see how it
looks I didn't really notice like a
massive difference after three hours so
I didn't think it was really worth
coming back so I thought after six hours
we could see how it lasts or I think
it's amazing that I didn't really have
to check back in with any bad news three
hours ago so let's see how it looks okay
so these lights are so bright at this
time right what's going on the first
thing that I'm noticing here is where I
was saying it was really blotchy before
it's even more blotchy now so I feel
like it's kind of like my foundation has
kind of come off right here but I don't
recall like leaning on anything I don't
touch my face ever so what's going on so
yeah that's a hydrating side all the
redness from my pimples are kind of
black peeking through a lot more
actually my laugh lines are pretty bad
we rubbed the other side is looking
incredible I am so impressed with it
like it's actually insane I'm so happy
because I'm so picky when it comes to
foundation so I'm really glad that I'm
loving this one it hasn't gone blotchy
in any areas nothing's faded at all
which is incredible because it has been
six hours so I'm really impressed with
that all over the makeup like all the
highlight and bronzer and stuff is
holding on perfectly to my foundation
the bronzer on this side has faded a lot
so I don't know why but you can kind of
see like the highlights still popping
cuz all the lights but the bronzer on
this side is a lot more intense or the
foundation is off around my lips do I
have a few I just I'm just gonna see if
it looks cakey where my mouth because
that's where it gets really dry I guess
on the matte side this does this area
right here and like above my lip looks a
little bit a little bit dry it's
probably like the best foundation has
lasted on my skin so yeah I guess that
is the
vo now you know that the mat foundation
is incredible the hydrating one
definitely needs another go to see if
this patchiness is something that's
going to happen all the time
I don't know but yeah I would definitely
recommend the mat foundation unless you
have very very very dry skin I'm not
sure if it would look cakey on you just
because this area right here is like a
little bit dry looking but if you do
have very very dry skin maybe the
hydrating one will be better for you and
if you have oily to normal skin the
matte one I think will be really really
nice on you so again I have a shade
medium ten honey Elaine tanner oh yeah
medium tan honey my bad
okay I love you guys so so much and
really happy we have a new favorite
foundation I know that's really dramatic
like I finally won it one day but I have
high hopes and love you guys so much and
I'll see you in my next video mmm wait I
need to get my nails done today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
