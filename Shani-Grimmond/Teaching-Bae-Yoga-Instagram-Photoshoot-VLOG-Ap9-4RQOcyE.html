finished my makeup and I pretty much did
it in half now I know you those days
where you just can't be bothered doing
like fallen makeup I mean this is
full-on but I could have done it so much
better but this is the dress that I'm
promoting first so I'm gonna go get some
cool photos with this I'm so excited I
love taking photos and love editing and
stuff it's so much fun okay so I just
got the first photo and I love it so
much I show you guys when I get back
from taking the next outfit photo but

it is so different to my normal style
but I love it so much so next
burner so
on to our last outfit change for the
photo and my god is sort of windy up
here
breezy I'm getting some
okay so we've done the photos that
probably to a calm do you think that
took
six hours now it probably took like two
hours to get two hours to get all that
done but we never get some food now
because it's time to get late and we
gotta go to court before it closes and I
want to get bindi a little bed - because
she's sleeping on a little blanket look

bed do you like it she lacks it I'm so
excited that I'm Neely betta by the way
guys I've been sick for three weeks as
you would know because I kept talking
about it I was probably so annoying oh
oh what's that a burp but I'm really
better which means I can go do more like
activities and stuff I just like for the
past three weeks having really been
doing any physical activities or like I
know fun things I guess because my
body's been run down and I don't have
like energy to like go to clone Mountain
or do fun things when we can so that's
why today I guess was pretty chilled and
also I'm not going to glamorize my life
just for a vlog this is just just how I
wanted to spend my Sunday really chilled
Sunday I can't wait to learn better
enough to go out and party have a little
club'
it's been about two months since I've
gone clubbing and I love clubbing I'm
still a baby of course I still love
clubbing so I think in a few weeks I can
do that I'm so excited
but yeah it's nice to like wake on the
morning and not have a hangover like
every weekend it's really good so while
I've been away sick I've had so much
time to just think and I've been
thinking so much about how much YouTube
moves to mean how much making videos
means to mean how much I love it so I've
literally made like lists upon list of
like oldest videos that I want to film
so I'm going to be bringing out those
videos a lot over the next few months so
I'm really really excited about that I'm
gonna have Chinese chicken and corn soup
we don't have any soup jobs so I'm just
going to use a mug I wonder how this is
going to go doesn't look too great if
you ask me but two minutes just quickly
can we address how disgusting the new
shapes are do you think they're gross Oh
I don't mind the same if I will not the
same is care other taxes are so
different I've been inside the other day
I think you know what it tastes the same
they only spat whole mouthful out my
fake Freddie mmm I just gave Benny above
pseudo she's all snuggled up but a part
of literally my everyday routine is
calling Michael so I thought I'm acyl
add it in the vlog because I literally
do it every single day we talked on the
phone for like two hours at least
we're just obsessed he's actually coming
to say my house in about a month if you
guys didn't who he is
let me introduce you hi doll I was
telling them before that we FaceTime
every day for like two hours yeah I
can't get enough of you I really feel
like Doritos I'm getting my period so
that's a good excuse to be able to eat
Doritos have you seen so much junk food
before I get it I'm gonna do it anyway
alright guys so my nachos are ready and
I'm gonna eat them up now and I think
I'm gonna end the vlog here just because
I'm gonna watch some Netflix and YouTube
videos and just hang out and relax so I
hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog if

helps me out so much and I will see you
