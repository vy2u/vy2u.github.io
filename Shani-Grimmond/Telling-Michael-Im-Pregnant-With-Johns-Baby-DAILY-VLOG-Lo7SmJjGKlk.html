channel oh girl Liliana nip-slip so
today I'm gonna be vlogging it because I
have a few exciting things that I want
to share with you guys so I went to
that's true polite last night I think it
was like 3 o'clock in the morning
because I was editing a few videos that
I found yesterday that I stayed up
really late doing um so I work about
8:30 and also I need a month blank I
have too much stuff to do to go to sleep
so as you can see my face is really pale
right now because I turned my body last
night so I'm feeling super fresh with my
tan I'm happy about that I'm sorry I'm
just about to make brekkie I'm having
scrambled eggs I literally have
scrambled eggs every single day because
I want to see like a nutritionist and
they said that I need to have like a lot
more eggs because I need more protein in
my diet to get energy and all of that so
I'm going to have caps kimchi lots
tomorrow and with my hands
okay breakfast is ready and I have all
of my tablets that I need to take for
the day I always told about my vitamins
but just quickly I want to talk about my
skin anybody if you guys didn't watch my
last clothes I basically started taking
these antibiotics they're called
acumen and I'm taking them because my
breakups this sorry bad and therefore
learn also nothing else is stopping them
and to be honest this is the little pill
here it started tiny and easy to take
but looks like a tutorial oh this is how
you take it I know but my skin's
actually put out part of it from that
sorry I'm really heavy oh my girl guys
I'm running sorry freaking night I wish
I went to bed early last night but I
have to leave in like 5 minutes and I
haven't even done my hair yet what is
life I would surely have the worst time
management in the world like it's the
jerk but it's okay we'll make it work so
I'm doing like full galantin today or my
lips are dry contact reads them properly
yeah I'm just doing like a Maxima high
because it's like the easiest thing to
do
I needed to do it in life literally hop
now I'm worried about this highlight is
stunning it's laura geller and the shade
gilded honey I put some of this on okay
guys so I'm ready now and I'm leaving
and I'm super late so I have an idea I'm
gonna tell Michael that I'm pregnant
with John's baby I was assuming he says
you always want to see if your friends
are supportive all right now I know that
Michael would do
anything for me he's so supportive but
just a few to baseline
I okay that's a really bad angle by this
will activate his heels to kick it off
I'm Serena how laughs I'm saying
I often fuck no lack I know
you are please tell me you're lying
mr. stress as I'm like Southwest Krantz
without singing next level

times
