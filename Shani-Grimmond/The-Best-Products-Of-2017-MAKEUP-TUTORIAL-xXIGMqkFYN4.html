in today's video I'm gonna be doing a
makeup tutorial a really full glam look
using all of my favourite products
throughout the year of 2017 so this is
all of my absolute holy grails and these
products I would literally die for
nobody if I had to have like one product
for each step these are the products I
would use so I would definitely
recommend every single one of them and I
feel like these is like the most helpful
videos to watch if you want new makeup
because you can literally just you can
see how it works you can see how good it
is and you can go to the shops in black
so I really hope you guys like this
video this is the law say of five days
with Shaunie so I really hurt you guys
enjoyed it
I had so much fun but ho my god it was
like really time-consuming I did not see
that coming but let's just get into the
video so the first thing that I like to
do is apply my face so this one is the
Urban Decay
a vitamin and fuge in future infused
prep spray sir I just want to put this
on my face to really wake me up a bit
mmm
the main reason I like this is just
because it makes my face feel super
fresh but we are going to start with the
eyes because I always get fallout now
for my favourite eyeshadow of 2017 this
one is the modern renaissance palette
and this one is a hooter Beauty rose
gold textured palette so it owner I feel
like they have very similar shades in
there but this one obviously is more
versatile but both of the formulas are
just so beautiful like pigmented buttery
everything you'd ever want in eyeshadow
so in today's video I'm going to use
this one from Anastasia and we're gonna
take a blending brush and I'm just gonna
start by taking this dusty cool turned
pink right here and that's gonna go
straight in my crease I wanna do like a
pinky kind of look today so this is
gonna be my transition color as you can
see it is a blends beautifully you
hardly have to do anything I think the
best thing about this video is like
everything that I'm gonna use I know
it's gonna work so well because it's my
favorite so I know nothing's gonna
really go wrong well I mean I'm hurt the
next color I'm taking is this cool turn
brown right he also this one's going in
the crease I'm gonna make the
eyes super super doc usually I like to
do like really nice warm runs II kind of
looks but this color has like an I meant
this pilot has a bunch of different
eyeshadows II hidden you know play
around with and get different looks so I
thought I'd do something a little bit
different besides I am wearing a silver
dress so I can't you won't turn on the
eyes which sucks but we'll make it work
then over back in with that pinky purple
shade and I'm gonna blend out the edges
being really careful there cuz that
Brown will look like you've got a
bruised eye if you bring it in too far
on the inner corner well if you bring it
up to your eye so just be careful I'm
also gonna blend that on the outer
corner so we can blend the lid color
into this one and it's gonna be nice and
smoky out here I'll literally never get
over how good those eye shows are so
next we're gonna take a little brush and
spray it with a fixed plus this stuff is
honestly the best stuff in the world oh
my god I have eyes shadow will leave my
hand better fall out there I think all
right so the next color I'm taking is
this champagne color right here and I'm
gonna pack that all over the inner
corner of my lid just cuz everything so
Matt I want to add a nice pop of shimmer
then of course blending two colors
together next up I'm taking the Urban
Decay heavy metal a glitter liner this
one's in the shade Distortion my
favorite one is the gold digger one no
Midnight Cowboy mode but this one's
gonna fit perfectly for this look so all
of the formulas are the same I'm pretty
sure just The Midnight Cowboy ones my
favorite shade but this one's just like
a iridescent clear glitter so this is
just gonna match the look better I still
love this one it's stunning so I'm just
gonna pack this pretty much where I put
all of that shimmer there then I'm just
going to look down and wait for this to
dry so then we can blend the brown and
this color together mmm it's like the
easiest way to apply glitter cuz you
have nerve fallout so just going back in
with that Doc Brown I'm just gonna
lightly Pat over the edge right here
just very softly the next product I'm
taking is the Kat Von D tattoo liquid
eyeliner Oh says it's waterproof I never
knew that but we're gonna do a little
baby wing on anywhere else to do wings
like what do you mean this is the only
reason why I'm starting to get better at
wings the little felt tip on the end is
just so easy to maneuver on the eye so
let's really concentrate for this step
now it's time for the lashes so my
favorite brand at the moment for lashes
is lash Warriors they're just so big and
fluffy sorry easy to apply because I
have very like well a lot of space right
here I like my lashes to be absolutely
massive so these ones are perfect for me
so I'm gonna go ahead and apply these
and I'll be right back lashes are on
let's move on to the prime I serve I
remember like for probably six months
straight I was using this primer it was
I mean it still is so good it is the
Giorgio Armani Armani primer the reason
why I use this all the time is actually
one stupid reason it smells like
literally the best thing I've ever
smelled in my life like if there's a
perfume with this sign I need it right
now just smells incredible extra
luxurious I've never really been one to
believe a lot in primates I still use
them just here because if it's gonna
possibly make my makeup stay on longer
then we may as well just to use that you
know but it feels really nice when you
blend it in so some moisturizing it
doesn't make you like oily or anything
like that like it doesn't make you well
glowy pretty much it just like it's a
nice base my favorite foundation of the
year was the Clinique beyond perfecting
a foundation concealer I just used this
one for donation this one's in the shade
eight golden neutral and I also have
this one in the shade eleven so this
one's more pink this one's more yellow
I'm just gonna see what the yellow one
looks like with my ten at the moment
because it looks like it's gonna match
pretty well it's nearly empty but this
has such good coverage and it honestly
lasts the longest time because it is so
thick so it just sticks on like no other
I'm just gonna blend this in with a flat
top kabuki brush oh yeah that much is
really nice my feet tear at the movement
yeah you know you love the foundation
when you have like two different shades
like you doing home there's definitely a
lot of other foundations that I
absolutely love but if I had to choose
one at the moment
this is probably what it would be what
was the other one that I started loving
honor the giorgio armani one is also one
of my favorites as well better give you
said in my last year so i thought i'd
show you guys my other phase and I also
love how it has this like little spatula
lookin thing on the end it's so easy to
apply it's literally just about to start
raining I can hear all the Thunder never
had to go well like way to ruin the mood
I'm gonna blend my bronze out all the
way down my neck but that means one take
my necklace oh oh alright so the next
step is to conceal under the eyes you
guys know my all-time favorite concealer
is the top shake tape in a shade
light/medium how many times can I say
that please oh wait is this the right
one yeah okay so I'm just gonna paint
that under here and I'm gonna blend it
out with a Beauty Blender also another
favorite of mine probably without it it
literally leaves not one little shudder
of purple tones under your eyes it's so
so good I feel like my favorite powder
hasn't changed in the longest time this
is the alarm sei translucent powder and
I think I'm nearly at yellow
oh wait nervous to leave
yeah but it's just like a no hang out a
little bit of this goes a very long way
and it just melts into the skin
beautifully and if you get really bad
laugh lines feel free to bake a little
bit in there
my next favorite product is the benefit
flawless pata this one's in the shade
champagne this is the foundation powder
oh my god I thought it was nearly empty
Wow I've got a decent amount in there
the reason why I love this is because it
adds a little bit of extra coverage on
your face at the same time as setting
the foundation I've gone through two of
these I just oh love it so much I don't
think I'll ever find a powder better
than this like oops what can you do when
I come throw you bad go back now what
you gonna do what you gonna do let's
finish off the lower lash line so I'm
gonna take that Doc Brown once again and
I'm just gonna take that on my lower
lash line from an outer corner to inner
corner
nothing crazy on lower lash line today I
would put white eyeliner in there but
like honestly it just comes off anyway
and of course don't forget to cut your
lower lashes with Allen mascara I smoked
that eyeshadow out quite a bit so I'm
gonna make sure the lashes are huge
my favorite bronze eye is the give me
Sun by math but honestly I don't know
where it is the Merman I usually never
lose my cup pot it's just nowhere to be
seen and I don't know where it is sorry
instead I'm gonna use the Galan
terracotta bronzer in the shade 0-3 I
really really like this one this would
probably be my second fave it has like
little shimmers in it as well so it's
even got a nice color to it I'm just
gonna add this to my cheekbones so
really nice to the face I always go so
dramatic with my bronzer I love it
I really like how it has like a touch of
orange in as well just cuz it makes the
skin look really sunkissed and glowy and
healthy you know how it is and of course
I'm just gonna blend this down my neck
as well before I forget I'm just gonna
go in with that lip color and I'm gonna
put that on the inner corners of my eye
just for a little bit of shimmer in
there I think true dramatic but I just
some fixed clasp on my brush as well
just to make it pop that little bit more
the next thing you wanna do is set my
eyebrows because I know if I leave it
any later I'm just gonna forget this one
is the Ready Set brow by benefit this is
a clear brow gel sorry I'm just gonna
use this to push my eyebrows up and the
reason why I like clear brow gel is
instead of like colored ones it's cuz
this like I mean you can really just go
crazy and it's not gonna get all of your
skin and it just sits up really nice now
for a bit of color on the cheeks this is
the Mac blush in the shade of blush baby
I think Mac flushes will kind of always
be my favorite just because they're not
overly big mminton they're not under
pigment to the disarray so you just have
to put a really small amount on your
cheeks and it's easy to like build it up
without going too crazy you know what I
mean
I hate my blushes away to be pigmented
it's like whoa you look like a clown
this is perfect the format is just so
beautiful
I feel like blushes aren't really a big
thing to me like I just want like a
little bit of pink on the cheeks and
then I'm like my favorite highlight of
the hands-down was this beautiful
beautiful highlight here from Mac this
one's in the shade at themeing blush
it's kind of like a oh wow let's come
out of the pan if I drop this upside
down it's all coming out but it's kind
of like a peachy champagne e gold
highlight it changes in different
lighting it's just so beautiful so my
favorite brush to apply highlight is
this one like by a mile
it is the anastacio a 23 brush it can
make any ordinary highlighter look
amazing I don't know what it is I think
it's something to do with like the brush
heads on there but holy so I'm just
going to go crazy here it's definitely
not as like intense as like the art for
highlights but a lot of people don't
like their is because that's sort of
crazy pigmented and they make your skin
look a little bit textured but this
one's a really nice alternative and I
write this one so much this year
this one's more of like a glow on the
skin it's not like a crazy crazy
highlight you know what it means sorry
this is what I like to use more like an
every
basis rather than like a really intense
one so this is what it looks like here
because I'm going out tonight I want to
use something crazy dramatic so I'm not
going with this over highlight in the
shade Rodeo Drive this one's a champagne
it's beautiful like you guys will be
able to see the difference like it makes
you happy you don't even need to put
fix+ on it it's just insane it just
depends what kind of finish you want I
didn't even have to think am I gonna
have to kill my shirt oh I didn't even
have to think twice about what my
favorite lipstick was these ones are
liquid lipstick by huda beauty and it's
in the shade a girlfriend it's a perfect
perfect nude it's not true
pink it's not true Brown it just goes
with every single makeup look and I
honestly couldn't live without this like
I know I'm dramatic but seriously it's
that good okay little my lips on now it
looks add another reason why I love this
little bit sick is because it's so so
incredibly thin it doesn't like smell or
taste weird like a lot about the
lipsticks do and it's just so pigmented
it lasts such a long time and I couldn't
think of a better liquid lipstick
honestly but I want to make my lips nice
and glossy sir and then for my favorite
lip gloss of all time this one's from
essence it is so incredibly cheap and I
just really like how it lightens up my
lips or we're just gonna go into town
make a beautiful light pink last but not
least I'm gonna go in and set my face
with the Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray and long-lasting every
single time I go clubbing or go anywhere
I want and need my makeup to stand for a
long time I always go for this for this
one I think I've been through three
bottles so there you guard the diffuser
is sort of good doesn't leave any like
marks on your face at all beautiful
refreshing
alright so I'm gonna go fix my hair and
I'll be right back okay so I just got
into my outfit for the night and I guess
