channel oh wow good those great ok bye
hon you got 5 hello guys welcome back to
my channel so that was Michael gist then
a really dramatic honor um so in today
CR I'm gonna be doing a Q&amp;amp;A I haven't
done one in so long and I just want to
sit down with you guys and give you an
update of what's been happening in my
life because I feel like a lot has
changed if you know I was actually help
loaded like two days ago like I'm just
really dramatic like that it is being a
hot minute since I've done one of these
and they're kind of like my favorite
videos to film because I just love
sitting down with you guys and having a
chat and letting you in on my life and
what's been going on so I asked you guys
to ask me questions on Twitter so let's
go ahead and hit them and yes I still
have a squeaky chair it's so annoying I
do have a new one that's outside the
room but I don't know how to put it up
so I'm waiting for someone to help me
put it up I stopped at building things
on the slates not good ok so the first
question that we have here is do you
have any advice you'd give to your
younger self and honestly this is like
my favorite question to answer I feel
like I've answered this a few times but
I have so many things to say because
when I was little I thought it was like
the cool thing to do in school to like
and not get to like not apply myself in
school and like worry about things that
didn't even matter so like I weigh so it
was so important to like try and fit in
in school and like try and be in the
popular group and stuff when I was like
grade eight grade seven but then like as
I grew up I kind of realized that like
that stuff like does not matter at all
like you've really just got to put your
education first and just cutting people
out of your life that shouldn't be there
like that aren't making a positive
impact on you like I don't know I just
find it crazy when I talk to people that
are in high school now and like the
whole like popularity thing and like all
of that like it shouldn't matter it all
like as soon as you leave high school
that stuff literally does not matter
like everyone goes off and does their
own thing like it's literally a whole
nother world outside of school so if you
guys are in school still because I know
a lot of my followers are a little bit
younger like don't worry about like
fitting in or like not being able to be
yourself like just be you and be happy
and hang around people that make you
feel like you can be yourself so I met
this beautiful
beautiful lady at a club like three
weeks ago and she come up to me and said
thank you so much for talking about
bullying in your videos it's great to
like bring awareness to it and
everything and like I think the what you
were talking about in your video was my
situation that happened with my family
and I was talking about how I was
watching the news and this family lost
their son to bullying he took his own
life so it was just I don't even know
how this was brought up in the first
place but I just want you guys to know
that there are people out there that
care about you and love you and will do
anything for you and just to go talk to
someone that you love and trust if you
are going through something because they
probably have no idea and I'm sure they
want to help and I want to help and I
don't know what what I can do to help
but I want to help and I I want to put a
stop to bullying and I hope everyone
does and I hope we can all do it
together but I guess the first step is
just telling someone if something's
going on and starting from there I guess
but huh so okay so I knew this
question was coming and it is why did
you and John break up so if you guys
didn't know yes Jonathan and I broke up
for real this time
I know I've made a whole video about it
before and like made a big deal and
they're girls crying and blah blah but
this time like I don't want it to be a
big deal like I know it I know it is to
an extent but like it's just not gonna
work like we're not gonna work together
we're so fine like he's still my friend
okay so basically I'm not sorry for us
not being together I'm just sorry if it
upset you guys at all because I know
everyone looks online and they see all
these couples and you think oh my god
they have the perfect relationship trust
me
you literally have no idea what goes on
behind the camera like I'm sitting in
here filming this video it's gonna take
me like 20 minutes and then you go back
to like your normal life so what I'm
trying to say is like you see the
smallest portion of someone's
relationship with someone's life and I
know it can look so good from online and
like obviously you're only going to post
like then the positives of the
relationship and that's what I did so it
creates this like mental image in
people's head like oh my god they're so
perfect they're so cute a comment for
them to have kids I can't wait for them
to get married but like you've just got
to think about like it's like it's not
perfect like
every relationship that you see it is
not perfect at all I don't know I'm just
like ready to move on to the next
chapter of my life and I really love you
guys so much for supporting me through
everything like honestly I know it's
been such a crazy journey with like the
whole breaking out getting back together
me crying me doing this and like I'm so
sorry like I just wanted to be as open
as I could possibly be but now I feel
like the doors closed and like it's time
to move on and and we're both fine so I
think that's the most important thing so
yeah John's calling me he's still my
manager sorry it's all good in the hood
okay so let's move on to the next
question are you happy with your life
right now by the way I feel like the
content on your channel has changed
heaps I like the variety but please do
some more makeup tutorials yeah so
basically I thought I would change out
my channel a little bit because I was
getting I was getting a bit bored from
just doing like makeup tutorials like I
personally don't think I'm that creative
when it comes to makeup like I love
doing makeup and stuff but I don't know
I feel like there's so many people out
there that are so incredibly talented
and like would do amazing with just
focusing on makeup but for me I I don't
know I feel like I'm pretty good at
makeup but I'm not like oh my god like
I'm gonna watch all of her makeup video
she's so good like I feel like a lot of
people are kind of here for like my
personality as well because it's a bit a
bit of like quirkiness a bit of
weirdness in my videos so I think I
think that's what people kind of watch
my makeup videos for anyway oh my god my
hair is so flat send help I um yes sir I
just thought I made someone cooperate
like more personality in my videos and
they've been going really well I'm so
glad you guys have liked them like all
of my move bangs and like I don't know
my vlogs and like all the challenge
videos I've been doing like it's been so
much fun and I love it so much so I'm
really happy that you guys are enjoying
them but of course I'm still gonna be
doing makeup tutorials I just I just
need to practice my makeup honestly like
my skills are just not just not like
vibro Kells and I just really want to be
able to do makeup like her I just need a
practice vibe just being so busy with
work and stuff so I'm gonna get back
into that and practice more makeup and
it's so the question is are you happy
with your life right now and like
honestly I know this is so cliche to say
and like
I tweeted the other day and I said I'm
sorry happy right now like I
want to cry like I genuinely feel sorry
happy and so free and just like I've
never felt like this happy before and
like for the past week I literally want
to cry of happiness like I don't know
what it is but like I just feel so good
and so content and this guy replied it
was actually so funny this guy replied
to my tweet he's like this is the
classic tweet from a girl that just
broke up or just had a break couple
something just to make the exes jealous
and I'm like no honey like I'm not doing
that to get back at anyone like oh I
wish nothing but the best for John and I
wish he's happy and I hope he's happy
and stuff and he would wish the exact
same thing for me and there's no type of
like getting back at each other all like
I genuinely feel so happy and I never
tweeted anything like that just so he
can see it like I'm sharing my life with
you and how I feel with you guys so that
I just found that really funny that
someone said okay so the next question
that we have here is do you think you
would ever create your own makeup with
skincare line no I'm like not really
intellect creating makeup oh my god
excuse me I had a burrito for lunch and
it's really not going down at all I
don't know I don't really want to make
makeup I it's not something that I'm
like overly passionate about I mean who
knows tomorrow I could change my mind
and be like so obsessed the idea of
doing and I could do it but sooner take
don't like mock my word on that like I
don't know hurry but like for right now
Noor I'm not really interested in doing
my own makeup line I know I've said it
in the past that I want to do it but
there is something that I'm working on
right now for you guys that will be
coming very soon so you'll have to
witness oh my god you guys are gonna die
the typical youtuber thing oh so secret
project seriously though oh the next
question is how does it feel to have so
much independence Korea and money-wise
at such a young age um well I mean I'm
obviously very happy about how far I've
come at the age of 21 I'm so proud of
myself I I do think that I could be
pushing myself a little bit harder when
it comes to like uploading and and all
that but I also do like to put my
happiness first as well I do think like
so far I've done really well and I put
so much time as
so much energy and so much dedication
into what I've accomplished already but
then again like so is everyone else like
everyone else that has a job like you
guys put so much time and effort and
like all of that into the into the job
and I guess it's kind of like the same
thing but for me it's just like instead
of working for someone else I guess I'm
working for myself which I guess I was
just lucky enough to be able to do and I
hope one day you guys can you know do
the same thing like have your dream job
and be sorry happy with it because
that's exactly like me right now like
Michael was sitting on the floor like an
hour ago and I was just like this is the
weirdest job like I'm so contented so
happy like I'm just I'm just sitting
here like doing my hair ready to like to
sit down and film a video just to like
talk to you guys and like I don't know
it's such a wait concept of like of
YouTube and social media and how it
works and stuff but I just I feel so
lucky and so grateful and yeah I'm just
really proud of like what I've achieved
so far
it sucks how money literally controls
the world and I don't want I don't want
to give it the power of that so like I
never talk about it I never think of it
as like a massive deal oh my friend has
messaged me o that I haven't spoken to
in months Wow
anyways um yeah I mean obviously I'm
fortunate enough to be able to buy
things for myself and all of that and
I'm happy I'm really happy about that
but it's not something that I obsess
over the last question is a happy one
and it is what is your ultimate goal in
life and I would have to say to just
have a happy healthy family and to
always have my friends and family super
close to me and always be there for them
and them always be there for me that's
literally just like that's all I want in
life and I I love traveling I love doing
what I love and I think if I keep going
down this path and keep working hard
then I'm gonna be able to achieve that I
can't wait till one day I have a family
and share it with you guys I think that
is my ultimate goal I cannot wait to
have kids like seriously I love kids so
much it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
soon I'm getting a dirty I'm single what
I feel like that's so cliche because
everyone wants to be happy and healthy
but um
yeah obviously I have I have goals with
like my
and all of that and like I heard one day
that I can reach them and and everything
but ultimately my goal is my family my
friends my dogs anyways guys I really
hope you enjoyed today's Q&amp;amp;A if you have
any other questions for my next video
let me know down below and also leave
some video suggestions down there so I
can film some videos tomorrow I love you
guys I don't have the boss indigestion
