Lombok right now we just arrived to our
hotel and is so amazing it is quite hot
today so we're going to go away by the
pool and relax a little bit because the
boat ride over was a bit rocky so I'm
feeling a bit unwell in metonic gili
trawangan is what the island is called
so this is what it looks like as soon as
you walk out of our hotel what is right
there and it is really real of real real
real of blue all those people swimming
out there yay now it's time to relax by
the pool the sun's behind the clouds so
I returned for Shani but since they're
relaxing just what I needed
there's a bar just there how convenient

so relaxing my hair is literally in one
big knot but we're gonna grab some lunch

didn't get it on the sheet and I'm kind
of 10 kind of loving it give not to last

got myself some pancakes and some
croissants with an orange juice and we
are sitting by the pool nice way to end
the last day and I'm wearing the hotel
thongs because I lost one of mine we
like paper cute all right I'm walking
backwards so I have good lighting but we
are off to start the day we're going to
five different destinations today and
I'm super excited and I've done my
makeup it goes I don't think we're going
into water until the end of the day so
yeah
so we're at our first destination now
we're at a place where they make sarong
and to make one strong it takes two
months mentally girls
if they can't make this long machine
that we saw before they can't get
married they make you free Wow
this is just a feel the surrounds that
they've made
the next stop we have here is fatback
village I rested it right oh well
there's little huts everywhere this is
so cool
there's little schools so this is one of
the houses and there's more rooms in
there well and that's made from clay and
that's made from grass but no babe yeah
I just got these my little sister there
were two dollars the three other cars in
it she's gonna love them so as I said
before 700 people live in there and
there are 150 houses and hands they're
all the same family so like one family
oh my god god is gonna die when you see
this oh that's alright allelic drop out
it's sweet so we just drove an hour to
another beach and we're going to try
some surfing
I've never surfed before this is going
to be interesting this feature is really
cute though because it has like all of
these little huts and chairs to sit on
so let's do this guy's muscle rub did

playing up so I didn't get too much
footage but I got as much as I could
