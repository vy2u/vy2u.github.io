channel so in today's video we're gonna
be doing a full glam makeup look I want
to do something that's like perfect for
the holiday so nice and full coverage
and really just you know holiday
appropriate gold on the lid right on the
lip you know how it is so let's go ahead
and jump right into the video and also
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already and let's do this
I just went ahead and primed my eyelids
because you guys have seen that a
million times and listen my brows so
let's move on to the eye shudder I'm
gonna use the naked heat Urban Decay
palette now I haven't used this I mean I
think I've used it like once or twice
and everyone seems to like love it so I
just want to give it another guard
because the colors and hey look amazing
but I never had any luck with the first
true palettes I literally heard of them
so much like they weren't pigmented and
I just weren't like as rich as I'd hoped
so let's see what we can do I'm gonna
take the shade sourced this one right
here and that's in a girl in my crease
as a transition and the brush that I'm
using is the Inglot 6ss brush my god
this brush is like too weak to like dip
in there I'm just going to take this in
windshield wiper motions oh my gosh just
brushes so stuff it's literally the best
brush for the crease well so far this
color is nice and humid it's alive in
the press so I'm going to a movie
premiere tonight for pitch perfect 3 I'm
so excited because the first two were
amazing I'm going with John and I
noticed a lot of people when we last
videos were asking about me and John but
oh so me freshies I'm over it but I will
let you guys know what's happening when
I'm ready oh my gosh this is my favorite
brush ever and look what's happened to
it
something's happened to it okay this is
the morphe and five one four I'm still
gonna use it anyway and the next color
I'm gonna take is hmm I'm gonna pick up
this color right here and that's gonna
grow in the
priests like close to the crease and
we're gonna deepen up the outer corner
of the eye just gonna be something
that's really easy to wear I love warm
turns so much it looks so good so I'm
just starting by popping that on the
outer corner and then I like to blend
that into the crease then I'm gonna take
that original color and blend out the
edges and next I'm gonna take this color
right here and I'm just gonna put that
only on the outer like outer half of my
crease because I really want to deepen
that area up yeah just a touch fit next
up I'm gonna go in with the tarts
what is this Park Avenue princess chrome
paint shadow pot I'm so excited to use
this because honestly this looks like
the most beautiful bronzy gold shade and
it's like a pressed eyeshadow so I'm
hoping it's very like foiled looking I
like when my eyeshadows like super
texture eyes so I'm just gonna put this
on the inner part of my lid oh that's
nice I feel like if you use your finger
there it'll definitely be more pigmented
well more textured the glitter in here
is definitely like big chunks it's not
like flying little which I like it's
different
I'm gonna take my mac fix+ so we can get
this very intense that's beautiful then
with one of us left Ella brush I'm just
gonna use that to fade the true colors
together so I'm just gonna lightly Pat
over that dark cranberry shade here the
next thing I'm taking is the ultra three
metallic liquid eyeliner in the shade of
liquid gold so I'm just gonna create a
little wing with this and then I'm gonna
go over it with a black eyeliner I'm
happiness works out not sure what it's
like a light gold it's really pretty
I've used to the fold arthritis could be
interesting okay wow it's actually
signed to sting my eye okay now to go in
with the black eyeliner this is this is
the hard part
okay I'm just gonna go ahead and fix
that later but for now I'm gonna go in
with the Mac extended play get get back
getting it I always fuck that up
Giga black Giga black flash there we go
I'm just gonna card my lashes that
eyeliner is cracking already that's so
annoying if you guys know of any gold
eyeliners let me know one winged Lana
carries up wonders app great beautiful
just what I wanted now for the primer
I'm taking this one from Make Up For
Ever this one's house it's a new shade
this one's the hydrating primer sir I'm
just gonna put this on the back of my
hand and then blend it out all over my
face with a brush because I probably
have glitter all over my fingers from
that eye shadow Stephanie I'm going on
oh this all that product is seriously
amazing where is it it's the liner lips
of 101 appointment and it's a multi balm
conditioner it's here to the flowers I
always just like put random products in
my head it would just touch that with my
face curse I've been obsessed with this
foundation lately it is the nas velvet
matte foundation stick in the shade of
Barcelona medium force or this is what
I've been using every day it's
definitely not a full coverage I'm sad
it's more of like a light to medium
coverage so I'm just gonna see if I can
build it up today because I just love
the color I really need to go get some
more of the nose foundations because
this color matches sorry well that's
definitely rare for me
let's see you guys know if you don't
want a lot of coverage third this is
amazing I'm just gonna blend that in
with Mike Buki brush I'm gonna take my
lip balm off it leaves a really nice
finish as well like it looks super
natural I'm just healthy I'm so happy
right now because I got my little sister
to clean my makeup brushes last night so
all of the maclean it's literally just
the best feeling no time for concealer
I'm going in with these Smashbox Studios
skin 24-hour waterproof concealer in
this
Latin neutral I really want to highlight
under my eyes today so this is a very
light shade my god it's sort of wet like
some moisturizing that didn't sound good
I'm gonna go ahead and pull when this in
like what it's so said it's like
watching all those dark snap those guys
Lana's see you in probably an hour after
I found this video I'm just gonna wash
the makeup off I hate wearing like full
glam during the day it's actually the
worst feeling if I ever wear makeup it's
literally just like this smallest amount
unless I'm going out of course and then
to set that down I'm taking the Kat Von
D translucent pad I haven't used this
one in so long okay so I'm just gonna
make sure there's no creasing at all
under my eyes and then I'm just gonna
Pat this on over the top and this is
gonna make sure there's no creasing at
all throughout the day if I don't bake
under my eyes I literally just like
crease up straight away that's not a
good thing then I'm going in with my
benefit pad off this is the hello
fullest in the shade champagne well I'm
just going to put this on my face
my face is so shiny right now this
brushes are really fluffy what's going
on I don't want to disturb the
foundation so I'm just being very gentle
and then for the lower lash line I'm
gonna go in with that dark crease color
once again and that's going from outer
corner to inner corner I'm just gonna
take that on a really small blending
brush and pack it on okay I feel like
that kept one deep powder like literally
took off my concealer and then of course
I mascara on my lower lashes and then we
can pop on some full-season oh my god
I'm so excited for that time to add some
falsies these ones are from Holy Grail
literally the early lashes that I've
been using at the moment so I just
ripped all the old glue off now I'm
popping these ones down okay man
microphone just died so generally if you
heard that but I
going in with the Park Avenue princess
contour palette this has a bunch of
contour bronzes and
powder highlights like banana shades and
stuff so I'm gonna go in with this color
right here and we are going to contour
the cheekbones a little bit I'm actually
obsessed with this shade nice and warm
tone I'm gonna take it around my
hairline as well oh my god why does that
keep happening it's like I haven't set
my face properly but I did and then I'm
also gonna go in with this color down
the bottom here okay very lightly
oh my god it's sorry patchy I'm trying
to keep it very light handed but it's
still very chic I'm just gonna pick up
this banana shade right here and I'm
just gonna put this underneath the
contour to clean it up a little bit
because you know it needs to be nice and
sharp who's gonna make the cheekbones
look a little bit deeper as well next up
I'm going in with this a beautiful blush
by Mac it's in the shade of blush baby
it's literally one of those colors that
matches every single makeup look so I'm
just gonna put that on the apples of my
cheeks for a nice pop of color okay
obviously didn't set my face probably
because everything sticking to it 10
minute that's why I don't understand how
people don't set their face like because
all the products that you put on over
the top just like goes so intense next
up I'm gonna go in with the Laura Geller
New York gilded honey illuminator I love
this product so much I'm gonna mix it
with this shade right here in the shade
diamond dust as well just first
something a little bit different over
the top but this is like I keep
stuttering this is like a beautiful
holiday highlight shade in my opinion a
nice gold so pigmented oh my god
beautiful I really want to make a
highlight and I want it to look like
this like what do you mean it's
literally so hard to make makeup
products these days I've tried and I
want it to be like amazing like I'm
looking to sell find that shit but it's
so hard to get like the perfect formula
for anything hmm I'm also gonna go in
with this one he
I feel like this has like a lot of
purple arid essence to it so I don't
know if it's gonna really be holiday oh
wow
that's literally blinding I'm just gonna
put it on the high points right there
and then also on my nerves okay that's
like she laughter well like what the go
to my nose now it's time for the lips
I'm gonna go in with the Evan Decay 24/7
that gladden lip pencil in the shade at
bad blood and oh my gosh she smashes my
nails I'm so happy right now oh I had to
get rid nails for the Christmas season
like a serious okay let's line these bad
ways
I might do the Ruby word lipstick my
mouth just because this is literally
like the perfect red let's see what it
looks like a lip liner and the lipstick
it completely different shades of red
that's going on oh my god this is the
perfect holiday red I just had a test
day but oh I'm just gonna be basic AF
and put some hoops in every look last
step is setting the face this is the
glam glow glow setup I kind of smell
like pizza shapes so anyways guys I
really hurt
oh it's lip sticks I'm making sure it's
not on my tape but it's like a matte
lipstick so it doesn't get on the tape
