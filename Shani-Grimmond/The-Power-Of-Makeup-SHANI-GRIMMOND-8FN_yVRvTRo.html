to my channel I hope you're doing really
well so in today's video I'm doing the
power of a makeup I am so excited so
basically what this means is one side of
my face is full glam and the other side
of my face is completely bare so this
video is inspired by nikkietutorials she
did the first video on YouTube of this
and it went completely viral and so many
youtubers have done this sin so I will
leave her link down below because it is
amazing the message behind this video I
think is incredibly important so
basically you can wear as much makeup as
you want or as little makeup as you want
because at the end of the day makeup
washes off and I think people do take it
really seriously if there's some things
that other people do that they don't
like about their makeup if they over
draw their lips too much or anything
like that it doesn't affect anyone else
in any way shape or form what you do
with your face and what you do with your
makeup is entirely up to you and you can
do whatever you want and then on the
other side I'm leaving it bad because I
think you guys should completely be
confident within yourselves without
makeup as well so with and without you
should still love yourself completely
personally I am so incredibly confident
with my skin and how I am naturally
we're all born the way we are for a
reason and I think you should just
embrace it and be happy with it and love
yourself that's pretty much my message
for the day let's go ahead and do this
makeup I am so excited to do all my face
glue first thing that I like to do is
take my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot so I
have little spidery veins when I leave
my eyebrows up so when I like to play
around and play with this lovely canvas
I like to cover them up and this also
make sure that the eyeshadow really
sticks down and the colors are nice and
vibrant as well so it's kind of like a
two-in-one and I always go in and set
that eye panel with a little bit of
powder any powder will do so I'm just
focusing this in the crease so all the
colors that we put over the top blend
out nice and seamlessly now it's time
for the eyeshadow so the eye look that
I'm going to go for today is something
that I generally lean towards just
because it's what I think looks best on
my skin so just for the sake of this
kind of video that's what I'm going to
be doing so I'm taking the morphe 3 5 0
palette oh my god this palette is
incredible and I'm going to take this
light orange shade right here and this
is going to be the transition shade
I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit
cuz I'm so excited so I'm just looking
down and putting this directly in my
crease and this is going to kind of make
the illusion of a bigger eye because I
do have tiny little beady eyes so it is
kind of like an illusion it's great now
picking up my BH Cosmetics genic so 9
color eyeshadow palette and I'm going to
take the shade right here and this one
is going to go directly in the crease so
just a little bit lower than one we just
put on so I'm just going to spritz my
brush with some mac fix+ just to make
sure it's really intense when I put this
color all over my lid I'm going to take
the eyeshadow by makeup geek this one is
in the shade grandstand and it's foiled
so it's incredibly pigmented so I'm just
going to Pat this all over my lid time
to prime the skin so I'm going to take
the Laura Mercier foundation primer in
radiance okay I have to remember to put
only a tiny bit on for half my face so
the reason why I like to use this one is
because I really lack a glow to the skin
because I feel like it makes it look a
lot more black healthy and I love the
luminous look it's gorgeous I naturally
have dry skin as well so it's nice for a
little change times and foundation so
I'm taking my giorgio armani luminous
silk foundation i have the shade 6 and
it is perfect to my fake tan so I'm
applying this with a damp Beauty Blender
it just has the most beautiful like silk
finish it's crazy I always like to blend
it down my neck just to make sure the
color is exactly the same on my neck so
as you can see over here I have a little
bit of acne scarring and it totally been
a redness so this is the reason why I
like to use like a full coverage
foundation for concealer and taking my
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the shade
NC 20 and I like to use this shade to
really brighten under my eyes and also
cancel at the end cancel out the
discoloration on my eyes at the same
time having use distant ages
well sorry brightening and also a little
bit on my chin as well and down the
center of my nose now time to do some
cream contouring so I'm taking my
favorite product ever it is the Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in the shade at
6.5 it is the perfect shade for people
around my skin tone so I'm just going to
put it directly on my Beauty Blender and
put this under my cheekbones just to
chisel it out a little bit and add some
color back into my face because when you
put foundation on a lot of the times it
just like washes out all the color in
your face obviously if you have a full
coverage foundation on like me as well
we're just dabbing this on and I also
like to put this around my forehead as
well now time to bake under my eyes I'm
taking the Elora Mercier translucent
setting powder so I'm going to take this
on a little wedge this is literally like
four bucks for a massive bag at Kohl's
or bullies or anything like that so I'm
just going to put this directly under my
eyes just to make sure know that crumb
now do that concealer left move
throughout the day for the brows i'm
using the anastasia dipbrow pomade in a
shade medium brown so I'm just going to
carve out my eyebrows a little bit with
this and then to set the rest of my face
I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte powder
in the shade transparent I'm just going
to dust this all over for my brow
highlight I'm going to mix these two
shades together out here so a little bit
of the match a little bit of the
shimmery because I can't decide what one
right underneath my brow for my lower
lashline I'm taking that same orange
that we put in the crease and I'm taking
this from inner corner to outer corner
then I'm taking that same crease color
and putting that on the outer half of my
lower lash line just to kind of even it
out a little bit
and for an inner corner highlight and up
this shade right here and popping that
right there now it's time to finish off
the eyes so I'm going to take the
covergirl the super-sized mascara but
this one is the Star Wars edition it's
honestly amazing so I'm just going to
coat my top lashes with this just so I
can prep them for falsies for my lower
lashes I'm taking this Mac mascara
because it really gets in there and
makes them super super long so this has
an incredibly long name I'm going to
leave what all these products are in the
description below if you guys are
interested now it's time to pop some
lashes on these the ones that I'm using
today this is literally my favorite part
of doing makeup bold lashes wow I didn't
work out for us did it now it's time to
contour so I'm taking the Bahama mum up
runs up by the balm and this is a Real
Techniques contour brush first time
using this I am so excited so I'm going
light-handed well I'm going to try to
because I already have a bit of cream
contouring there just to enhance it a
little bit now taking my hourglass
ambient a radiant bronze light bronze
art this is gorgeous
expensive but gorgeous I'm just going to
put this on my cheekbones to warm them
up even more why not
and for blush I'm taking this Manama but
look Milani baked blush in the shade
luminal sole luminal sole this is sorry
gorgeous because it has a look a little
shimmers in it so it makes your skin
glow and then I'm going to bake a little
bit under my cheekbones to make it even
more defined
yesterday when I did this it was way too
harsh I'm gonna try and not add as much
now it's time to make that glow on my
cheekbone so this is the best brush for
highlighter it is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills a 23 so fix+ that my Gorge went
like a strong highlighter the one that
I'm using today is the steel art in the
shade kitten so this one comes with two
different shades but I'm going to mix
them together okay now watch
so amazing
this is so underrated and so is this
brush and so as it explodes like
literally it's a must in a makeup kit
I'm going to take a little bit of
bronzer around my jawbone just so you
can actually see the bastard now it's
time to the lips I'm taking the Kylie
Jenner Dolce Dolce K lip liner and I'm
just gonna over drill my lips
and then taking the shade at candy kay
and then I'm going to take the dose of
colors liquid lipstick in the shades and
and put this over the top just so it's
not as pink and it's more like Avenue D
no duping shade last but not least for
the lips I'm taking the dose of colors
lip gloss in the shade or undressed and
this makes your lips appear a bit bigger
if you want lip gloss on sounds are
really nude so I'm just going to put a
light coat on and then spread it out
with my finger or so that we have the
finished look I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and learnt something
new I just think people need to take
makeup application less seriously I
think it's just a way that some people
like to express themselves and obviously
to feel more confident so if you guys
enjoyed this video please give it a big
thumbs up and I'll give you a little
close-up of the makeup and then I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
