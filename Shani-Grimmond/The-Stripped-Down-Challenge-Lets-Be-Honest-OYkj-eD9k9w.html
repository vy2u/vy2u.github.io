the stripped-down challenge so of kids
really this is a video where you don't
do any editing in the video you just
talk for like ten minutes straight and
Jonah Green made this YouTube challenge
up so I'm pretty sure his aim was to
kind of like show viewers that you make
mistakes all the time with speaking and
like I know it's kind of just like a
roll video if you guys to watch so I
feel like you guys don't think dogs are
doing a lot around the house I always
stop at my word so just like get ready
for this and I added to the Edit I edit
them all out all the time so I was just
editing my makeup tutorial that I just
did on this one and I just realized like
how much I edit out of like all my
mistakes so I thought this is the best
video idea ever and I feel like you guys
don't really know me that well so I
would say about two years ago or
something I was on tumblr for like three
or four years and I was the most open
person ever like people be like have you
had sex like have you done this and I'd
be like yeah and I'll give them advice
about it and stuff I would just used to
talk about stuff that no one would ever
talk about but I feel like now that I
have a bigger following I'm a lot more
scared to talk about that stuff
um and I'm really scared to talk about
like my beliefs and like I'm scared to
swear as much as I do in real life and
I'm scared to be like a hundred that
myself because obviously like now with
like more followers it's like you've
gotta be really careful with the way you
act and all of that because I find it if
I am completely open I just offend
people with like what I say or like what
I think or whatever so this videos going
to be interesting so I'm going to talk
about let's let's just talk about the
first thing that comes to mind and I
have touched base on this before but I
found it so interesting so I remember
this like one time I went to a club and
this guy was just so incredibly rude to
me and he was just like get out of here
I want nothing to do with you he had no
idea who I was and it's just crazy
because sometimes I'm just like I'm so
incredibly shocked with how brutal some
people can be without even noticing like
I don't know how people can like leave
comment on YouTube video or leave or
even say something mean to someone in
real life and and not even think twice
about it
I honestly can say from the bottom of my
heart that I could never or I have never
sent one mean comment to anyone or so do
you think mean to someone in person like
to intentionally hurt them I just don't
get how people do that and if you guys
that have to deal with that kind of
stuff at school or in the workplace or
anything I just want you guys to not let
that get to you because obviously those
type of people get those happy people
are the ones that are actually having
troubles and stuff so I just wanted to
kind of touch base on that um yeah what
else has been happening so I don't know
if talk about let's talk a little bit
about myself so you guys can get to know
me bit more so you guys I don't know me
my name is shawni goo Raymond my real
name is actually cuz shiny and not a lot
of people know that so ka SH and I I
don't like people calling me that
because my mom used to call me that when
I was in trouble so on fly I don't know
I feel like people are getting at me I'm
19 years old I'm turning 20 in March
which I'm really scared about because I
feel like 20 is like where you have to
start getting what is it three minutes
um 20 is when you like have to start
taking laughs seriously I feel um I feel
like I'm just really like chilled with
life at the moment like I feel videos
like what I want to upload what I wanted
I try and be as consistent as I can like
upload a few videos each week um I know
I'm just scared to go my 20s because
that she it's like real I don't think
I'm allowed to sweat
can we talk about these YouTube rules
guys like what the hell is going on I
just how to sound out there my thought
process is just going all over the place
so let's talk about myself quickly so
you guys can get to know me and then
we'll talk about these YouTube rules
cause like what is happening hmm hey
pindy
that's a cute okay see I get distracted
all the time I have to always edit this
stuff out so what else is there for you
guys to know about me um I have a really
really small friend group oh my god I
don't know if I turn the microphone on
one second
it oh my god I did anyways so I have a
really small friend group and so from
when I was like a little girl bindi from
when I was a little girl I always found
it really hard to make friends and
that's just always been my personality
so my whole life I've kept a really
small friend group and I just find it
easier because you can like really focus
on like a few people at a time
um I don't know how people have like
these massive friend groups and like are
always going out places with people and
like doing things I'm like a really like
I love being home all the time um I'm
like a home person I don't know I just
feel comfortable in my home and like
only having a small friend group because
I feel like when you have a smaller
group it's like you can get to know each
one of those people completely I don't
know I find it really hard to come
across people that are really genuine
and that's why I find easier to just
like keep it small and just always hang
out and be super close Smallville um
what else you guys not know about me hmm
I have always been so shy I feel like
people watching youtube videos and stuff
you think all these people are watching
aren't shy and I've met a lot of
youtubers and a lot of them are really
shy and I just you like click to me I
was like ah I feel like viewers would
think that we're all like I know cuz
obviously we are how they are in our
videos and that's us being real but it's
like when you're in a room with other
people that's when you start to become
shy and I've always been shy ever since
I was little like my mum's friend told
me other day she's like I've known you
since you're like a toddler you
literally didn't speak to anyone like
you were just like always clinging on to
your mom and you just like never spoken
like growing up to like high school like
you know grade 7 grade 8 I was so
incredibly shy or speak to anyone and
that's why I think I do have that small
friend group because unlike that just
what I'm used to
um yeah what else
um I live with my boyfriend my boyfriend
is 24 we have been in a relationship for
like 18 to 19 months now I'm so
incredibly happy
a something that I never thought would
happen is to like for me to meet someone
so oh my god I can't why am i emotional
now I never thought I would meet someone
like I honestly don't understand what
the hell I'm not like am I getting my
period or something no I never thought I
would meet someone as beautiful and like
kind as my boyfriend now because before
I met handles like all these guys that
were just like players and boys and
honestly just made me so miserable
at one point I had to go to doctor and
I'm like honestly I'm so upset all the
time it's literally of this one guy that
just like made me feel like a piece of
 and I just want you guys to know
that there are like men out there that
will tree was so much respect and I'm
just so happy that I've found someone
and like I just feel so lucky to have
found someone like Jonathan because I
feel like it's really rare because
nearly every other guy I have met isn't
what is that noise nearly every other
guy I've met isn't as like loving and
it's kind and all of that but I want you
guys to know they're definitely out
there you just have to get your
spectaculars way what i spectaculars no
my goggles no what are those things
called
I don't know what they call binoculars
huh yeah so I don't know I just got so
emotional I just I just I guess I went
through some with some shitty ass
guys before Jonathan and yeah that's why
I went on the pill because my hormones
were like like they're going all over
the shop and my doctor was like you need
well I think you need to go on the pill
because your hormones obviously like
going all over the shop right now and
this guy obviously isn't helping and all
of that so I'm glad that chop is done
like I've honestly never been so happy
in my life
eight minutes little choke for ten
minutes and so yeah that's that I keep
like going off in all these different
directions like my brain is your thing
um so yeah that's something else about
me I think I pretty much covered all
bases um so yeah let's talk about the
YouTube rules now because what the hell
is going on like
Oh anyway so the main one that makes me
pissed off is that you can't swear your
videos and you can't make certain videos
they get to lead it or unmonitored so
whatever I think it's stupid how now
youtubers I don't really know how to put
this like I feel like we have to be like
oh my god
see I know I didn't think about this
before I said it so now up this
video and kidding I just feel like now
that we can't swear and stuff it's kind
of like we have to follow all of these
guidelines and we can't you know say we
want to say or do we want to do in a
video now we can't even swear so now you
have to beep out this arrow and stuff
otherwise the video like it's deleted
and I know you can't talk about like
rape and stuff like that which I
completely understand but there are
videos out there that kind of like
educate people when it comes to like
rape and stuff and I understand why they
don't want people to talk about like
sensitive subjects and like natural
disasters and stuff but there are videos
out there that really educate people on
those topics and I think that is so so
incredibly important to educate people
on stuff like that I just place my mind
that you can't I know you can't really
say what you want to say in videos
anymore for me it's fine because I make
you know I make makeup videos so it's
not doesn't really affect my channel at
all because all my videos are pretty
much educational and I kind of do okay I
how to do this but bindi Luna what are
you a mate but people like Shane Dawson
and stuff like I don't know I feel like
they're just entertainment so how is
that going to work here I don't know I
love change awesome by the way Hitler
boom youtuber huh it's past 10 minutes
there's one more thing I want to talk
about is Shane Dawson's videos okay so
this is like freaky-ass so if you guys
watch Shane Dawson's videos where it's
like Jeff's out shopping like malls and
then like deaths and aeroplanes I'm not
like recommending to watch these videos
but I have watched those before and they
are so freaky like I get the weirdest
feeling after
she knows obviously like seeing people
die it's not like graphic or anything
but it's just so heartbreaking and and
it makes me feel so like I don't know I
don't know how those videos are going to
go with like the new YouTube rules I
hope all of his videos are like fine him
to keep uploading but I know I love
Shane Dawson so yeah that's pretty much
all for this stripped-down challenge I
hope you guys enjoyed it um it
definitely is a lot different to like
the other videos that I do and I haven't
seen anyone do these this video for a
really long time but I was just sitting
I was like freaking hell and it's so
much I just want to like sit down and
talk I can't wake up tool for 11 minutes
straight usually I like I don't know
what to talk about like I know when I
would like my close friends I can just
talk and talk and talk for hours that
when I'm with people like I'm not close
with her I just man I like finest so
hard to think of something to say but
you guys are like my besties and I just
can't I feel like I can say what I want
to say now so um
whoa I'm gonna go now hope you guys
