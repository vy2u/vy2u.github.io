something quite serious that I feel like
I just need to clear up because a lot of
people are kind of starting to make
rumors and assuming different things so
I just wanted to say I just want to tell
my side of this story and if you guys
have no idea what I'm talking about you
you will soon find out but firstly I
just want to say I would never support
or have any sort of association with any
group like the Nazi I am NOT racist in
any way shape or form
I do not discriminate against any
nationality or race I'm not that kind of
person so basically what happened was I
was out of friends of a friend's
apartment I went there to hang out with
him before I went to an event so I was
there for about 10 minutes and I started
snapchatting and one of the snapchats I
was running around the house and I was
not telling my brother and my friend and
they were just playing with nerf guns
and I just little funny to snapchat
because they like adults and they're
playing with nerf guns and usually like
my brother plays with them and he's like
eight or something so that's why I'll
snapchatting don't I snapchat I hold a
botany and I posted I do another one
that person and I pretty much just spam
so I don't look back at my snaps so we
left and we went to the festival two
hours later I get a text my brother
saying there's a Nazi flag in your
background and I honestly didn't see the
flag when I was at the apartment I did
not intentionally post this snapchat of
it because I didn't even see it in the
first place so I started flickering
through my snaps and I found the one
that he was talking about and I deleted
it straight away because I obviously do
not support anything like that and at
the point I didn't 100% know the meaning
of this flag I did know that it was not
a good flag obviously but I do know the
meaning now but I still feel like that
the fact that I didn't know the true
100% meaning behind his flag isn't
really necessary to the reason why I was
up I just generally did not see the flag
yeah I did a lot of research about it so
I guess that's where all of the rumours
started people just started twisting
things and being very misleading and
saying very untrue things the fact that
the flag was even in my snapchat anyway
the fact that I was even in my presence
I know is totally wrong
sorry if I offended anyone I I would
never intentionally hurt anyone
especially in this kind of way I mean
this is this is so bad oh I just can't
stress enough that if I saw this flag I
wouldn't be anywhere near this apartment
the person that hung the flag I have
nothing to do with I have no idea why it
was hung I'm not friends with this
person so I guess the bottom line is I
am so sorry to anyone that I hurt I know
for a fact that I heard a lot of people
and I'm not that kind of person
that people are like paying me out to be
and I do want to continue like making
videos and being like there for you guys
and helping you guys with advice and
stuff um I just don't want people
believing what they're reading because
there's so many huh there's just so many
like false accusations going around
right now and I really hope you guys are
smart enough not to believe it and I'm
sorry I'll see you guys soon
I'm going to keep making youtube videos
because I love I love making them and
nothing's going to stop me I just hope
you guys can forgive me for this stupid
mistake I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
