channel so in today's video I'm doing
the ultimate prom makeup look so when I
went to prom I did something very
similar to this although I wasn't as
good at makeup as I am now so if I was
going to promises something that I would
definitely do so I hope you guys enjoy
so of course I'm going to start by
prepping the skin this step is so
important you want to make sure your
skin is nice and hydrated so all of that
makeup can just go on super smooth so
I'm just starting out by taking a milk
on my face and then I'm going in with a
day cream that has no bloody SPF in it
if you have SPF in any products or your
raps on your face you may have flashback
in your photos and you do not want that
I'm also going to pop some lip balm on
this one is the it comics original lip
balm and it makes my lips so tingly I
love it so next I'm going in with the
benefits browsing color this is so rich
and pigmented I love it so much this was
actually my first time using the palette
and I was like alone out of the park so
what I'm going to do is make my brows a
little bit longer a little bit thicker
and just overall make them super neat
are you kidding me look helped you to
use okay now let's move on to be eyelid
so I'm taking the nice soft matte
complete concealer in the shade
custard and I'm just using this to
conceal of my eyelids and also to carve
out my brows to make them even sharp off
this concealer is amazing for these two
steps I would definitely definitely
recommend it it just works so well
because it is a really high coverage and
it is really creamy at the same time
sure when you guys know what's next so
I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte and
just setting down my eye base then I'm
going in with the dose of colors at base
Browns eyes shadow palette and i'm
picking up a medium brown to just pop in
my crease on a big blending brush so can
I just say this palette is honestly the
most pigmented eyeshadow palette I have
ever tried in my entire life it's
amazing so next I'm going to take a
really rich cranberry shade and this is
going a little bit underneath the last
color that we put down I'm going to make
it really warm and just beautiful so I'm
just taking a smaller blending brush to
apply that and then of course I'll take
a bigger blending brush to kind of like
fluff it up a little bit so next I'm
taking me darkest
from the palette and I'm just going to
pack this on the outer half of my eye so
the cup crease can kind of let into this
color you guys know the drill
cut creases are the most beautiful looks
on the eyes in my opinion I just think
it's so extravagant and I think for prom
that's exactly what you want so of
course I'm just going to blend the dark
brown a little bit so there's no harsh
lines at all and then I'm just going to
clean up the edges so it is nice and
neat so next we can go in with the
exterior magnificent eyes oh my god
I don't know if this is like sold out
like all around the world but can I just
say this is literally the easiest way to
do a cut crease and lovelyz product so
much so literally I'm just drawing that
on my inner corner and then I'm taking
the dark brown again and just playing
the true together so there is no harsh
lines at all you just really need to
take your time with this step because it
needs to be perfect
okay oh my gosh now it's time for the
face so I'm taking the Kat Von D
hydrating primer base and like honestly
how are you supposed to know if a primer
works I don't know I really don't but it
did feel really nice going on the skin
it felt super hydrating so I just popped
that all over my face and then I went in
with my Make Up For Ever HD foundation I
took this one just because it has no SPF
in it and honestly as I said before you
do not want that at all so this one did
have a really nice coverage it's not my
favorite foundation in the world but it
still does look really nice and I know
it's table it through - ah it's
photographs well she's a shiny okay so
next I'm going in with concealer I'm
taking the new multi concealer and just
putting this under my eyes to make sure
there is no visible dark tones under
there like no thank you
and I noticed that to consider like I
wasn't sticking properly so now I'll
keep you guys updated on when I think
that can fill up so of course I'm going
to go ahead and set that down with the
trim okay yeah I see Laura Mercier
translucent powder this one is
hands-down my favorite one in the world
let's go ahead and set the rest of the
face so I'm taking the Australis fresh
and flawless and I'm just packing this
all over my entire face because I want
to make sure all the powders that we put
on over the top of the foundation blends
out beautifully so let's go ahead and
finish the eyes and we'll get back to
the face so I'm taking the darkest color
in on a little pencil brush and taking
that from outer corner to inner corner
then I'm taking the very color on a
bigger pencil brush and doing the same
thing but kind of like blowing it out a
little bit so it is nice and smoky I'm
just highlighting my inner corner with
the highlighting product that I use on
my cheeks later so I will talk about
that soon but I just wanted to make sure
the inner corner was popping just like
the rest of the eyeshadow though so now
it's time for mascara I'm taking the
essence whatever the tactics is cool but
it will be linked in the description
below anyways oh my god I have so much
energy I love it anyways I'm going to
take an angled brush with that dark
chocolate brown and I'm just going to
run that above my upper lash line to
make the lashes look super full so on
top of that I'm just going to pop on
some falsies to make them you know
amazing and like formal / prom where
they kidding these are nice and fluffy
but they're not over-the-top to the
point where they like cover the
eyeshadow I think that perfect so now
let's move onto contouring I'm taking
this one from sleek and I'm just going
to pop that right in my cheekbones to
chisel them out a little bit make my
face look sculptured oh my god so I
nearly forgot this step so I quickly had
to do it this is the Melo cosmetics
tinted brow gel and I have a shade at
light brown and I really just like to
push my brows upwards so my brows look
really full and fluffy and honestly this
is my Holy Grail tinted brow gel it is
amazing like my brows did not budge all
day not that I like left the makeup on
all day because like who wants to leave
is someone you like sitting on the couch
anyways let's move on to bronzer I'm
taking the Too Faced a dark chocolate
Soleil I never used this I thought it
was about time to change everything up
and it did look really nice so just
bronzing up my cheekbones and also
around my forehead and my jaw line so of
course I like to clean up that contour
line a bit so I took my Laura Mercier
powder again understood a little bit of
baking nothing dramatic I pretty much
just like wiped it off straight away and
it still looks so clean and sharp now
it's time for blush I'm taking this one
from it back is a beautiful really deep
berry tone and I wanted something really
neutral since we do have like quite a
lot going on but of course I want that
pop of color on the cheek so just put
little bit on the apples and then
blended it back so next it's time for
highlight so this one's a new one from
at BH Cosmetics and it is so pigmented
and beautiful oh my god if you guys
haven't tried this I would definitely
recommend it it's honestly like just as
good as the Anastasio glow kits it is
just great quality and I'm putting heaps
on because hello for like formal you
need it to glow for those photos so on
my cheekbones and also on my nose Lecter
saw the lip liner I'm taking this one
from essence in a shade in the nude I
really wanted to use a mixture of
affordable products and high-end so this
one is really good it's a perfect
annuity pink lip line up so I'm just
going to over line my lips and then I'm
going in with this lipstick from the
farm and this is a beautiful nude color
this one's in the shade oh I do not know
how to say that so I'm going to leave
that down below
so next I'm just going to go over my
lips with some lip gloss I wanted them
to be really juicy and glossy gorgeous
for those photos this one's from at
Kylie Jenner and it's in the shade like
lastly I want to set my face with the
mix that juhi finish mist I really my
face to be glowy and just really like
hydrated looking so I just took my hair
down and if you ever web buns this is
why your hair probably dies because the
ends are all scrunched up it's so bad
for you have it like my favorite
straighteners in the world are ghd's
they just work so well and they lost so
long so I'm just parting my hair to make
sure all my hair is straight and then
I'm going in with my favorite dry
shampoo it is the batiste extra extra
large volume it makes my hair so big
it's so a ladies and gentlemen and here
we have the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did please give it a thumbs up because
it helps me out so much I love you and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
