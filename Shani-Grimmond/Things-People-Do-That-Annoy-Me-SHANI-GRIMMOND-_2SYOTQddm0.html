name is shawni and today i'm doing a
video about things that people do that
really annoy me so I've got a big list
here on my phone and let's just go ahead
and read them the first thing and
probably the most annoying thing is when
people say what's wrong when there is
nothing wrong if you ask me what's wrong
and there's nothing wrong then there's
probably going to be something wrong
because it's annoying okay so who John
nothing is wrong hey sure when people
burp in my face or even burp at all I
mean I can burp but other people can't
that's just how it works
don't stop it I am serious so
when you're eating something really
really good and someone that you're with
start picking at your food your food oh
when people cheer really loudly with
their mouths open especially when you're
doing something really quiet Oh gets me
going
you're right when people look at you
while you're at the gym obviously you're
not looking your best obviously you
don't want to be looked at so turn
around 27 28 29 when people stand right
in the middle of that escalator that you
want to go down and you want to get out
of that shopping center because you've
probably been shopping for hours when
you're in a highway and you're going 100
and then you get sandwiched by two
trucks so here you are in the middle
with an anxiety level of 2100 I'm making
my way no no no this one you guys
probably heard a million times but let's
face it it's never going to stop when
you just lay in bed you're ready to go
to sleep and your bladder says I need a
pee really Oh finally time for bed ha ha
so you make up nearly done and you're
just about to add a flick you add the
flick and it's not like a flick it's
just all of your face and your whole
makeup throughand that is the story of
my life because I subtly why not okay
nice and steady
oh my god I give up when someone touches
my face when I have a full face of
makeup on it's not going to be pretty
makeup makeup makeup thing I go when
people do not do the speed limit I
understand if your car doesn't get up to
100 because yes I've had that problem
before with my old Daihatsu charade whoo
kind of embarrassing but I do not
appreciate sitting behind people though
just daydreaming I have to do I
have places to go yeah sure just go
slower I mean I've got all day
when you're really excited to go out and
you're really pumped and then your
friends in really bad
and just like excited wha-why when
you're driving and you let someone in in
front of you so you go out of your way
to be polite and they don't wave at you
Oh My gods traffic yes go in
they twist my wave when you're in a
restaurant and you can barely hear
yourself think
what I'm today what is ready so the
person you're with at a restaurant gets
that food for you and he goes your food
oh thank you you're welcome
so good so there we have a massive list
of things that people do that annoy me
don't take this video too seriously I
just did it for a bit of a lull but yeah
if you wanna see more videos like this
make sure to give this one a big thumbs
up and if you haven't subscribed to me
already make sure you do that right down
there and yeah that's everything that I
have to say so I'll see you in my next
video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
