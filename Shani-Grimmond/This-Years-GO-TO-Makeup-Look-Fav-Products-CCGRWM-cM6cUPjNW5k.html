I'm just really happy to be filming
right now because I haven't filmed a
makeup tutorial in so long it's been
like a whole week and I've had enough
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video so what I'm doing today is a full
face of this month's favorite so I've
picked up so many new products that I've
just fallen in love with and as you guys
probably know if you follow me on
Instagram and I guess I've been blogging
as well but I've been traveling a lot
this month so I've been taking this
stuff with me every single where I go
and I'm so obsessed with ulcer I just
really wanted to share it with you guys
so you guys can go pick some of this
stuff out try it out for yourself and
fall in love with these products
yourselves so let's go ahead and jump
Madi the first thing that I've been
literally obsessed with is the benefit
browsing
turtle taming and shaping kit for brows
I have the shade 3 and I've been
obsessed with this for a really long
time but just recently I've been using
the waxy side and this has changed my
life usually I would only use the powder
but honestly ever since I stopped using
this my brows I've been looking
incredible it just makes the brows look
so naturally to find what I like to do
is start with the wax and create my arch
that actually isn't there I wasn't
gifted with a natural arch oh my gosh
great start I haven't done a makeup
tutorial in so long so I'm just using
this morphe angled brush this is the
best for brows if you guys haven't tried
out this product you honestly have to
get it I've never used anything so good
just saying I'm gonna do a bit of a
chitchat in this video as well cuz
there's a few things I want to talk
about on or so on my last video I think
was like two of years ago I did a whole
and I was just like sharing with my
clothes doing a try on whole sorry so
when I got like get even am I talking
about it but like I've always done Tryon
holes like ever since I first started my
youtube channel and people were
commenting on that video saying oh my
god ever since SHINee got her boobs done
she just gets it
it's at all the time and I'm like that
is completely not true I just wanted to
address that in a video ever since I got
my boob job my boobs have been in Moore
and like I'm only just feeling
comfortable now to like wear normal tops
and stuff like this like people with
small groups can get away with wearing
this why can't I like it's so annoying I
think the thing that annoyed me the most
was like literally when you have small
boobs people don't come for you when you
have big boobs it's like so not okay to
wear little tops and bikinis and any
type where your boobs are like out like
this like it's just so not okay for some
people and it just like really confuses
me because why is it okay for people
with small boobs but then when you have
big boobs it's like such a big deal like
get over it
okay now I'm gonna go in with the powder
and I'm just gonna basically go over my
arch and underneath my brow and the rest
is pretty much filled in with all of
that wax but I just like to define the
top and bottom with powder and we can
conceal to fix up the shape a bitch I
just got a b12 shot in this I'm gonna be
shot in there Sam so I have to keep
moving them so they don't like get big
lumps in them from all the product
annoucer just trying to be active you
know all right let's do this
oh I need to get my eyebrows waxed girl
my next favorite product is this one
here named bindi oh my god no seriously
though she got a haircut look at her
head look at her he is look being show
them your eyes look at what's this they
caught her holy it's all fun and that is
why you don't take your dogs to a
groomer last minute you've really just
got to book them in and be patient I
just should she was looking really ratty
so I was like I'll just take her
anywhere oh my god biggest mistake of my
life
the next product that I'm loving at the
moment is the huda beauty a mob
obsessions palette if you guys have any
watch me for a while and you would know
that I'm obsessed with all of these type
of colors this is like what I want to do
24/7 with my makeup so the first shade
that I'm gonna take is this a middle
movi Brown right here and this is gonna
be my transition shade so this Russian
obsessed with as well what is this it is
the morphe M 4-3-3 brush I'm just gonna
pop this in my crease just just start
off this look the formula of these
eyeshadows are absolutely incredible and
this palette is like starry Pathak for
traveling cause it's so tiny and there's
like been and there's a few different
looks you can do with it obviously
they're all gonna be like clam berry
kind of looks but I mean that's the way
I want to do you sorry your guys mean
day yeah I don't know who she's barking
at like there's no one outside you know
can get up here god bless I was gonna
move out because I was construction like
so loud like literally right next to me
and I went to like break my lease and
everything I went looked at a house it
was so beautiful and then but anyways I
roped up to the house for the inspection
I looked over all to my right the girl
that lived over there I was like a
play-doh so she was around my age and
she was literally like like looking
inside the door like this like peeking
through looking at me and I'm like oh
god I'm not moving here if she's like
spying on me already like that's so
uncomfortable like if I'm moving out I
don't want anyone to know where I live
like I'm gonna be so private about
it's gonna be in like a private like a
little estate I'm gonna have security
cameras like after getting broken into
like I am so horrified that people know
where I live
my other camera is being so weird so I'm
just gonna have to use this one but
hopefully they think I'll okay for you
guys alright so that's all blended now I
can move on through the next shade so
I'm gonna go in with this color right
here this is honestly like the prettiest
color in the entire world it is the
perfect cranberry shade so what brush
should I take I'm just gonna go in with
this little blending brush right here
and I'm just gonna pop this in my crease
and built it up nice and dark I'm also
gonna put it on the outer half of my eye
as well just here
and then of course I'm just gonna take
that blending shade to blend out the
edges right here and my favorite part of
the whole thing
cleaning it up with a makeup wipe yeah
huh the next car that I'm taking is this
dark purple right here I'm just gonna
literally pack this on the outer corner
of my eye just to deepen that up just a
smidge the next color I actually haven't
used this is the one that I used last
time and I was obsessed with it like I
love the formula and everything but this
time I'm gonna take this a really pretty
pink here and I'm just gonna pack that
all over the lid I'm assuming it's the
same formula as the other color yes
the next product that we have here is
the benefit of bad gal bang I remember
in my last video that was the first ever
Selena not lost video it was a few
videos back where I tried this for the
first time and I was amazed of how good
it was and this is the only mascara I
took traveling and holy crap this is
honestly my new favorite mascara of all
times I don't know when I'm gonna find a
new fav mascara because this is
overriding every single one I've tried
it's just like so light I'm gonna go
this fluff floating around it's just so
light on the lashes but the formula is
like pretty wet so it makes them just
like so thick and long it separates all
of the lashes I like to start from like
the very bottom of the root wiggle my
way up and my lashes look incredible
like they've never look like this before
usually I put like heaps of curts on but
I'm gonna put fake lashes on today so
I'm just gonna cut them for the nice and
black I just went ahead and did my
lashes and line off so these are the
lashes I've been loving lately they're
from lash warriors and these are the 3d
fur mink lashes and I use this style a
11 today I just really like these ones
because they're so freakin fluffy and
they feel like mink lashes but they're
not which is good my next baby has been
a favor for quite a while now it is the
urban decay b6 a vitamin infused
complexion prep primers right I love
this so much just cuz it feels so
refreshing on my skin and seems planning
with like a moisturizer I mean with like
a lotion one I might run you guys
through my favorite brushes as well at
the moment because I've got a few like
amazing brushes that I'm obsessed with
the first brush is the makeup geek
foundation stippling brush this is so
good to blend out my favorite foundation
speaking of makeup geek I feel like
makeup it used to be like one of the
most popular brands for makeup
especially like online and recently I
just feel like no one even uses them
anymore but the products are amazing so
hopefully they come up with new products
soon so love this so much
my new favorite foundation actually I've
been kind of like on an office for a
while but it is the hourglass vanish
stick now the reason why I originally
stopped using this is because it made my
face kind of
but recently my skin's been super dry so
if you have dry to dry normal skin then
I would definitely recommend this
anything to like normal to oily would
definitely stay away from it but I just
love I love this foundation like with my
whole life like honestly the shade the
formula the finish everything is so good
so I'm just gonna paint this all over my
face now the reason I love it is because
it just looks so easy to apply so you
look at that dry sales in the shade one
beige because if I didn't there you go
my face is a little bit yellow at the
moment but when I have the powder and
everything on it literally looks perfect
so the other favorite concealer that I
want to share with you guys is from
Bobbi Brown it is called the instant
full cover concealer this has the most
amazing amazing coverage the only thing
that I don't like about it is that it's
sorry thick and it's like hard to
actually put on under the eyes but other
than that the formula is a really nice
once it's blended oh my god Michael
literally walk into my house took my
Beauty Blender cleaner walked out and
I'm like um where's my did you learn to
clean it he's like I took it hey can you
worry son sorry
anyways I would a new 175 don't let
slide off no oh my Beauty Blender so
clean so I'm really happy okay so next
we have Dayla Prairie cellular treatment
a loose powder this is honestly the best
best oh my god okay that was really
traumatic like shut up this translucent
powder either Evan use this one is super
super expensive but I feel like it's so
worth it for me personally so I'm just
gonna take a little bit on my Beauty
Blender actually that's a lot stop being
dramatic now Shani and then I'm gonna
bake underneath my eyes with this the
reason why I love this is cuz it
literally just like melts into the skin
you don't even need to blend it away um
I need to stop things literally it's so
annoying I actually think there's like a
police chase outside like I'm not even
kidding I heard like a massive skeet and
I can hear the sirens
well relax I also love to bake my last
lines with this my favorite powder at
the moment is the Mac Studio Fix powder
in the shade NC 42 so usually I use the
benefit hello flawless one but I
actually ran out of that I had it for so
long as well lasts a really long time so
I ended up just reaching for this
because I had this in my collection and
I'm so in love with it I am gonna go get
my benefit powder again just because I
love that one just as much but this one
is incredible I can't go without setting
my face cuz I feel like my bronzer and
stuff doesn't blend as nicely because my
foundations all wet and also that vanish
stick is like super wet so I like to
make it a little bit map let's finish
the eye shadow off so I'm gonna go in
with distant burgundy shade and just pop
this under my lashline to even out the
eye shadow look just keeping under here
really simple wow that's very blown out
relax
of course it is time to create the lower
lashes as I said before this makes your
lashes so long so I'll be here for like
10 minutes coating them because I need
to couple of that I shudder you just put
on the next product that I've been
obsessed with is the top top Jaap wow
i'd really botched that one it is the
tired chrome paint shadow pot in a shade
top yacht it is a beautiful champagne
shade and it is perfect to highlight in
the inner corners so i'm just gonna pop
that right here it's really good for
like dark looks especially because it
like brings some more attention to the
inner corners it's so dramatic right now
let's go ahead and set the eyebrows or
i'm taking the benefit or Ready Set brow
this is literally like pretty much the
only one that I take when I go traveling
it is just like the perfect around
setting product I just like to push my
eyebrows up and it really separates all
the individual hairs so it makes the
brows look super full and I like that it
makes them like stay upwards throughout
the whole day
I don't know I just like that look it's
like a fan so we can blur in my face my
eyebrows is just like catch an X wait
till and also I will leave all the
products that I'm using down in the
description below if you guys interested
in anything oh my lord I found a new
favorite bronzer
you're gonna die it is amazing it is
from Mac it is called bronzing powder in
the shade we're fine golden it's better
than a Mac give me Sun it's just it's
more of like a bronzy glow than an
orange glow so the brushed I've been
using tool plaid is the morphe m5 3-0
this is like the perfect brush because
it fits really nicely under my cheekbone
so I like to put it under here and then
I bring it up because I always like to
have a nice bronzy face and then I take
it around my whole head basically why
not save blush at the moment is these a
wave of blush in the shade of burning up
this is just like the most beautiful
formula and I love Carly blushes because
I don't really like wearing like pinks
on my cheeks so I like more of like an
orangey pink instead it just like
matches every single and makeup look as
well like I can wear it when I have full
glam I can wear it when I have like the
smallest remaining makeup on it just
works with everything
oh my god now it's time for highlight
this is like a new favorite of mine I
took it travelling with me so I'd like
to fell out of the pan which is so
annoying but it is for Mike Wow a lot of
things are from Magnus fear it is the
darling extra dimension skin finish holy
heavens recently I've been so obsessed
with gold highlights and this is like
the perfect champagne e gold oh my gosh
look at that this is the what is this
Anastasio a 20-3 highlighter brush this
is the only brush that I use for
highlight it just makes everything so
much more dramatic like right up my
alley I have been using this pretty much
every day this month it is the Smashbox
that liquid lipstick in the shade always
on it is the perfect Naruto I cannot
live without this the formula is really
nice as well
I think here you have the wrong shade
cuz usually it's dark off why is it true
of the same shades must have taken one
of Ronnie's my bad okay this must be the
color I've been using hey I'm Chuck oh
my god I'm so dumb the shade is actually
called gotta light the one that I use at
the start it's called fair game oh my
god I'm so stupid this lipstick doesn't
suit every single eyeshadow look so when
it doesn't I always go in with the
lightest shade just on the like in the
middle here to make a little bit of an
ombre I feel like it's a little bit too
cool turn for the eyeshadow today so I'm
just gonna take be the lighter shade pop
it on blend it out call it a day
alright so last but not least I'm gonna
go in with the touch shower luminous
dewy skin mist since my skin's main star
Drive just like to use something that
makes my skin a little bit more dewy so
I'm just gonna alright guys so here we
have the finished makeup look I really
hope you all enjoyed it I really like
how it turned out it's definitely
different a lot more grungy under the
eyes cuz usually don't bring down like
the dot colors much down there but I
feel like it looks different looks cool
I'm happy with it so yeah this is all my
favorite products of the month and
probably the last few months to be
honest with you I haven't on a favorites
video in so long so I really hurt you
have an amazing day or night wherever
you are in the world I love you so much
and I'll see you very soon
I know PS got my nails done long I
haven't had them this long in sorry long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
