really quick hair tutorial and all you
will need is a sock bun two elastics or
hair ties and a few bobby pins just to
secure all the hair in place and so I'm
a hairspray so the first thing you're
going to have to do is part your hair
wherever you want it so I'm just going
to part it a little bit on the side okay
so then you're going to want to put your
hair in a low ponytail it doesn't have
to be perfect so just wrap there and
then tie it up
so once that started just going to mess
it all up a bit you can have it as messy
as you want and you can pull a few bits
out on the side and then I like to pull
all these bits up out here so my hair's
just got a bit more volume and then I go
with my hairspray just so it stays in
place all day then just spray all the
messy bits up here add a little volume
to that so now for the confusing part
I'm just going to wrap my donut around
the hair just like that and then I'm
just going to lean forward and put all
the hair around the bumps kind of hard
to explain but you just watch
and then just move all the hair around
so you cannot see any of the Saban and
then you just place the hair tie around
it then with all the leftover hair just
wrap that around the bottom just like
this and then you bobby pin that in
place and you can choose to either just
wrap it around or you can Platt it and
it looks looks pretty nice as well if
you plot that excess hair that comes out
so when le done I'm just going to mess
it up a bit more and play around the
with a bun at the back just make sure
it's soaked you are and there's enough
boy pins in there to hold it in place
and yeah that's pretty much all it's
just like a really easy messy bun pretty
much but yeah I really like it so that
is all for this hair tutorial I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and if you want
more hair tutorials like this like
really simple ones then just go ahead
and like this video and I'll upload some
more yeah that's pretty much it and
until next time I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
