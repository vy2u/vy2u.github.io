so in today's video I'm doing my treble
/ on-the-go skincare routine I always
like to keep my skin super hydrated and
I just take so much care of it all the
time even when I'm traveling I think
that's so important obviously when
you're traveling change of weather all
that stuff you have to really make sure
you give your skin the love they deserve
so my skincare routine is quite high
maintenance black me as a person because
obviously when I'm older I want to have
nice skin still and I don't really buy
makeup every day so I want to make sure
my skin looks nice
even without makeup and of course when
you put makeup on earth the top of like
dry skin it looks gross so just want to
take care of this doll I just put like
most and carotene on my face that so it
was really glowy this is what my skin
looks like without any makeup I love it
everyone should like their skin that
they're in so I have a lot of tips to
share with you guys and yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and jump into it because I have
a lot of amazing products that I want to
share with you so even if you have oily
skin a please don't skip your skincare
routine it is so important I'm telling
you okay so let's go ahead and jump
right into the video okay so obviously
the first thing they want to do is get
yourself in the mood put on some music
and my favorite Spotify playlist at the
moment is hip hop central it just has
the best beats obviously you can tell
I'm in the mood so let's do this I'm
starting out with the clinic take today
off makeup remover so I'm just going to
start working this into my skin to
really break down the makeup if you do
use like makeup wipes and stuff it kind
of like takes the natural oils out of
your skin which obviously isn't good for
you so I always like to use this stuff
if I'm lazy I use makeup wipes like
let's be real but this one does feel
really nice and moisturizing on the skin
the only thing I don't really like about
it is when you take the your scar off
your eyes it just goes everywhere like
look at this what do you mean dull and
then for any excess mascara I'm going in
with my at Johnson's or facial cleansing
wipes and I'm just going to gently Pat
over my eyes to get rid of that and I
think else and then we can move on to
cleansing the face so I like to use
these skins to treat gentle look
cleanser I've been using this for so
long now I love it and then I'm taking
my vanity planet ultimate skin spa I
love this one so much I've been using it
for a long time so you guys have seen me
use this a few times on my
channel before so I'm just going to put
a little bit of my cleanser on the brush
and I realized the battery wasn't in
because this one is a new one that's the
problem self okay let's get to it so
this kit comes with its three different
brushes but today I'll be using the
silicon brush because it's really like
soft on the skin really gentle and it
just gets rid of dirt and unclog your
pores and all of that good stuff and you
obviously want to do that every single
day and then there is another brush that
is a daily facial cleanser and also an
exfoliating facial brush but I just like
to use the silicon brush and then on the
occasion like once or twice a week I'll
use you daily cleansing facial ones so
this product literally makes my skin
feel so good it removes my dried dead
skin cells from the surface which
obviously keeps the skin from clogging
and it also prevents the breakouts
blemishes or whiteheads and all of that
gross stuff that you don't want on your
face and also it increases the blood
circulation on your face which
encourages new cells to come through so
it makes your skin super glowy and
healthy you know how it is dull I also
love that it has a hard protective case
so nothing can get in there especially
when you're traveling and also it helps
that it is super small as well so you
can take it on the go with you and
obviously you guys are more than welcome
to use my 70 percent off discount code
which is seriously saving me so much
money you just need to use the word a
shiny sparse or on top of that this is
cruelty free as well which I know so
many people will be happy about but
let's go ahead and move on to the
moisturizer because girl I use a lot
that's for sure
I use a few different oils and like
milks on my face but today I'm going to
be using the Bobbi Brown extra
nourishing a milk this one is really
nice and moisturizing for the skin I
just like to apply this before my actual
moisturizer so we can really lock that
moisture into the skin especially
because I have dry skin this stuff is
really good but color
it's bloody empty so now I'm going to
move on to like oils and stuff which
works just as good it really just
depends what your skin lacks and my skin
reacts really nicely to this one it just
feels so hydrated and then for the
actual moisturizer I'm going into my
kills ultra facial cream this one is my
favorite moisturizer of all time I've
gone through like three of these now it
just works really nicely on my skin I do
have sensitive skin so I don't want to
use anything that sort of like
sting my eyes or anything like that so
this one is perfect it doesn't make my
skin sensitive at all and it just makes
my skin look beautiful as you can see
right here so now for the eye cream I'm
going in with the Bobbi Brown extra eye
cream this one is very very thick but
obviously when you get older you don't
want to have any wrinkles under your
eyes well I mean you're gonna have a few
that's for sure but this is definitely
going to prevent like wrinkling and all
of that stuff oh my god the days of
Commons all the days are coming so
lastly I like to spray my face would be
a Mario Badescu facial spray this one is
it's so refreshing as soon as you spritz
this on your face you just feel so alive
and awake and or you're full like good
doll this one it's so good especially
nine dollars I am sorry I know okay so
then we have my skincare routine I do
this all the time whether I'm traveling
if I'm at my friend's house if I'm at
home that is what I do
I really change my products up too much
I've kind of like found the ones that I
really like and I've been using these
ones for a while now so hopefully you
guys can go try to repress and see how
it goes to you I love you don't forget

haven't already and I'll see you in my
next video
