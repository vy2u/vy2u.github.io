I just woke up and you're hanging out
with bindi because I'm leaving to go to
Perth in about three hours so I have
still a bit of packing to do and I've
got a face mask on this morning because
I work hard with a massive pimple on my
chin which is just annoying timing I
mean come on I never get pimples and
then just has about to go on a holiday
pop yeah I'm going to Perth to go to a
music festival I am so excited I'm going
with my friend Ronnie who also makes
YouTube video so that could be good that
should be fun umm and her fluid both
working as well so it's a really
interesting you guys can come with us
umm but yeah that's pretty much what's
happening hey bindi you sound baking is
that nice Sun Ben Ben he liked that I
gave her a bath last night and she's
sore fluffy you are just so cute I'm
gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you I'm
going for five days this is my bathroom
cupboard so grating there's so much
stuff in here but anyways I ain't need
to put ten on like ASAP rocky because
I'm so pasty okay why I am anyways I
think I'm gonna put on this one because
this is the one that I always do and I
just want to do what I know and then
tomorrow I might take this one except I
don't think I can take that one on the
plane and if I can I don't want to spill
throughout my bag this liquid oh this is
the only thing that we have in the whole
cupboard that I can have for breakfast
it'll have to do my tan is coming along
really nicely yay
I need to do my feet still yo and paint
my toenails
we need a serger sorry darling you have
to look at that oh my god I just took my
mask off and look how my skin's reacting
it's so red don't think I should use
that one again my face feels dry
I'm bout to go put a whole bloody bottle
of moisturizer on come on darling
time to Brunn's up I have a glove one
side I get on my hand
I'm sorry smart yeah I finally finished
packing all of my makeup I have so much
in here I just have it in like a Colette
clutch it's really big and it fits
everything so I pretty much have all of
my staples in there you've probably seen
these every single product and I'm going
to take my morphe 3 5 0 palette because
I want to orange copper eyes for the
first of all this color I'm at this
palette is perfect for a festival so now
time to pack all my toiletries it's
official I am ready to go to Perth I
just packed my suitcase and right now I
just have to put my cameras and my
laptop and stuff in my bag that I'm
taking with me on the plane because I
don't want that stuff in my suitcase in
case it gets like thrown around and
stuff yeah I have to order my uber now I
just put a little bit of like tinted
moisturizer on my face because the
colour difference of these two obviously
you can still see a really dark light
dark light so I made a little bit of a
difference but I'm wearing the ugliest
clothes I just want to be comfortable
this is going to be like a five and a
half hour flight my tan still wet oh my
god I feel so sticky and gross it's
really hot outside but let's do this
by the time I get in Perth my tan is
going to be dry so it'll all be worth it
guess what I am I made it in Perth so I
came in yesterday but I didn't really
feel like logging in the afternoon just
because we're kind of like rushing
around getting closer sorted for GTM
which is the festival that we're going
to I think that's what it's called
this is donkey that they have it looks
exactly like bindi just well not exactly
but I feel like they've got the same
personality don't you
we shall kill and they have the nicest
house here it's actually a moving I'll
show you around a bit so this is a loud
room here Ronnie's got a client in like
an hour so she's doing makeup it's just
oh my God look how nice it is so just
before we tried to like organise what
we're wearing and I think I think I have
what I'm wearing I'm gonna surprise you
guys though so this is the dress that
I'm wearing today we're just under go
get some breakfast in a second I think
it's really cute and it's comfortable
which is exactly what I want
we're getting a sign Ebola kinda cool
Shawny how to say it but she thought it
was
if I aside
like it looks like I see
we just did the Facebook and
I feel like they look really good Ronnie
chase
Ronnie doesn't look that great this day
we got our ass ie Bowl Hawaii and you
got your drinks fingers I greasy green
juice I don't think I'm gonna try that
looks too healthy but this
so Randy's doing a client now what do
you have like a formal today Michael my
god that's so exciting
that is so exciting hey baby so cute is
this the other dog they wanted to
introduce what's your name Olli I love
sorry okay so I'm waiting for writing to
pack her stuff so then we can head on
our road trip to the festival the vessel
is actually tomorrow but we're going to
drive to the house that we're staying at
tonight and apparently to three-hour
drive
we got so much travel but it's all gonna
be worth it um so I'll just I just got
off the phone - Michael Finch and he
said because I said him like photos of
outfits and stuff and I was like trying
to get him to help me and he said that
the one that I like wanted to wear isn't
really my style
it's that one right there that maroon
dress but you'll be able to see it
better on tomorrow if I do choose to
wear it but it's like it's kind of
see-through so you have to wear like
high-top bikini bottoms and like a
bralette and I feel like it's really
risky and I feel like the color and the
material isn't my style but I wanted to
wear something kind of different for a
festival and like inspired by Ronnie's
fashion and kind of just change it up
for once so I'll see how I go otherwise
I do have an outfit that's more like me
like neutrals and just more shining
basic bits boring but um yeah we'll see
I turn on these lacy dresses as well but
I just did look nice on me that's like
really not me still keen 3 so we're
picking up Ranas friend Jess um and then
we're on our way to the 3 hour drive
where is it do you want to pop it in the
broom so we are a little house now it
literally sleeps 20 people so it is a
humungous and there's like bunk beds
everywhere we got here for like six
hours ago but when it menu places I feel
so uncomfortable when I'm vlogging
because like I feel anxious
so I remember a vlog I'm anxious cuz
it'll be boring to watch but um yeah so
we just went got something to eat and
just a little look around and stuff and
got our alcohol ready for tomorrow I'm
so excited for tomorrow um yeah that's
pretty much all we did has pretty
chilled out there's like 15 people
outside playing drinking games right now
but I can't drink two nights in a row at
all I feel so sick the next day so
I'm just going to wait tool to Marge to
do that and I get really really bad
social anxiety sore I hate the in groups
like I cannot stand being groups I think
that's why only you have a few friends
because when it when it's like heaps of
people in one group I freak out I don't
know why I just got the worst feeling
like social anxiety is the worst thing
ever even when I was like around
Jonathan's family a few weeks ago they
went to like play ball games outside and
I was like I don't know what happens but
like as soon as it's like a group thing
I like freak out but if it's like
individual people I'm probably fine I
just get really nervous and it makes me
feel really uncomfortable so I'm fuck
this I'm locking myself in my room
and I'm a kind of a little bit
jet-lagged it's only two hour difference
but I think here it's 9:00 and that
Hermits 11:00 so I'm getting tired
anyway but I think the reason why I have
social anxiety is because I know there
are people out there except Ronnie so
it's like when I introduce two new
crowds I'm like but I really nice I met
them before I'm all talking and they're
like lovely but literally there's no
towel so I'm fucking using tea towel
we're supposed to bring like sheets
blankets everything like that and did it
bring a trail anyways you guys will see
more of everyone else tomorrow I just
like kind of feel like I need to warm up
to people over five vlog because I feel
uncomfortable in front of people which
I'll be a camera in that place but hope
you guys are excited for my festival
video I'm so excited to go and I'll
introduce you to Ronnie properly
tomorrow yeah I love you guys so much
and I'll see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
