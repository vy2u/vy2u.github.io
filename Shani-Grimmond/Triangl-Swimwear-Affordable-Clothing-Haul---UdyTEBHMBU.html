hey guys and welcome back to my channel
I hope you're having an amazing day so
today I'm gonna be doing a clothing and
bikini haul this was highly requested so
I thought why not give it a go
I've never done any kind of fashion
hauls before so it might be a little
rusty but I'm planning on doing heaps
more in the future so I really hope you
guys enjoy it and let's jump into it
okay so the first thing that I want to
talk about is the things that I got from
triangle comm and for you guys that
don't know what that is it is a bikini
store and it also sells underwear sets
as well I swear by that side they have
the most amazing bikinis I have ever
experienced and they're the only bikinis
that I leaned towards they're just so
pretty I have two pairs of bikinis and
one underwear set so I'm just going to
go ahead and talk about them the first
thing that I got is this Luci tangerine
set from triangle and it is $60 and I
love this it's so comfortable and the
bottoms are quite sheer as you can see
they're kind of see-through when you
wear them but I'm pretty sure that's
what they were going for anyway and then
the top or the bra is like really
comfortable it doesn't have too much
padding in it but it gives great support
especially if you have small boobs I
would recommend it because I don't know
how well it would go with bigger boobs
so here's people have been asking me if
you can wear this set into the water or
like take to the beach or whatever and I
would have to say that I would not
recommend the bottoms because as I said
before they really see-through and sheer
so as soon as you get them wet you're
going to be able to see everything so I
don't really recommend that but what I
do recommend is wearing this into the
water I think would be fine like since
there's padding you won't be able to see
anything and it just gives great support
so it's not like you're going to have a
nip slip or anything so I do think you
wear the top in the water and then you
could just like change the bottoms tool
maybe a black pair of bikinis I don't
know it's up to you guys but I really
love this set it's just amazing so the
first bikini set that I got from
triangle comm is this pair right here
and this is called Tilley sunburst and
it was $86 I'm absolutely in love with
these is my favorite bikinis on that
website so I had to get them and yeah I
love these it's not much padding in the
boob area so I'll probably recommend it
for small boobs as you may have a nip
slip when you are in the beach or
whatever but I really do love these
they're so so comfortable and the back
is
just strapped like this so you don't
have to tie it up anything so I love the
top and then the bottoms are kind of
like a wetsuit material like it's really
thick and it kind of makes your butt
cracks we're not going to lie but when
you're in the water it's fun so yeah I
love the color it's just like a
fluorescent orange and I'm obsessed with
these the last set of bikinis that I got
from triangle comm is this set right
here and it's called a Billy Firefly and
these were $86 as well I think the
quality of these became is absolutely
phenomenal the bottoms are also the
wetsuit style they're really thick and
stretchy and I thought this guy's small
in this one but in this one right here I
got the medium because it's recommended
on the website to get a size bigger than
what you usually would as the make is
quite small so I'm a time of 10 to 12 in
Australian sizes so I got a size medium
and it fits perfectly so I love that I
love everything about triangle so this
is like a gold metallic II kind of color
I'm absolutely in love with it it just
stands out so much and the top is like a
fishnet covered by an orange and I think
they match perfectly and again it has
like a little strap there so it doesn't
tie up it's so comfortable and I'm
absolutely in love with all of these ok
so let's talk about shipping and
packaging so to Australia it is $10 for
shipping and it ships in three to seven
days and I luckily got mine in three
days and it does ship internationally as
well but I haven't read up about that
one but I'm sure it's not long at all
for delivery and for the packaging I
think the packaging is the best thing
about the whole thing like I got the
belly Firefly packaging of bikinis in
this one here so it's like a little bag
and you can just put the bikinis in
there and it comes with like a plastic
it's kind of like in a plastic kind of
bags that has triangle written on it I
just think the packaging is amazing so
yeah I do love this so you kind of get
like bikinis and then a fruit bag that
goes with it which i think is amazing
and then for the other set I got this
orange bag as well and it's more of the
wetsuit feel once again so yeah I just
think it's amazing you can store all of
your things for the day life to run the
beach end of this bag so I got the
underwear set in this little packaging
thing here it kind of looks like a shoe
box and everything was packaged in modes
as I said so it just has triangle
written on it and you just pull the Box
out like well pick a box out like this
and then you pull the box out again like
this like that so overall I think the
triangle bikinis and underwear sets oh
absolutely to die for
I recommend them 100% and make sure you
do get a size bigger than what you
usually are because they are very small
and that is all that I have to say about
triangle I'll have the link down below
if you want to go buy some and I'll have
the direct links of my pairs and stuff
like that so yeah let's move into the
clothes so I'm kind of in the middle of
saving my money / I already spent my
money on lots of makeup so I can't
really spend too much on clothes this is
the first thing that I got is from
Target it was only 25 dollars I'm a bit
of a bargain shopper when it comes to
clothes because I just can't bring
myself to spend like 70 dollars on the
top I think it adds great structure to
the shoulders just because it's it's
really nice on my shoulders and also it
has a little bit of mesh down here and
it is a little bit of a crop top so it
shows a little bit of your stomach so I
just wear high-waisted pants with it so
it doesn't show too much skin but I have
been wearing this everywhere I
absolutely love it the next thing that I
got is just his plain black singlet from
sir pray it was only 12 dollars so I
thought why not pick it up because my
other one that I got from sir pray was
kind of like gravy because it had faded
so this is in this size extra small and
it fits perfectly and yeah I just need a
new singlet not much to say about this
one because sing Lots are boring I also
got this black top from sir pray it
looks like this and it is a crop top and
it has kind of a backless back on it I
guess it's just got like one little
strip it's kind of hard to see but yeah
this was only $10 so I thought why not
pick it up just for my videos because as
it is quite short it shows like my whole
stomach so I just like the top half of
it so yeah I just got this to wear over
yours
moving on to skirts I picked up two of
them from Target and they were super
cheap and the first one looks like this
it's kind of like there's a really thick
black material here and it has the two
little flaps and one of them is leather
and then the top fans that wraps around
your waist is leather as well and it has
a zipper on the back so it fits really
well this is size 8 and I just love this
it's nice and simple and elegant looking
so I think I'm just going to wear this
with a black top because as I said
before I love black so the next skirt
that I got from Target is this one here
it's kind of
same style with a little fluffy things
there and then there's deeper at the
back and this was $30 as well and this
one is in size six so that's kind of
weird that I have a size six and an
eight and they both fit they'll just go
to show you that they're different Meg
and I just think it's nice and simple
and it has like little floridly patterns
to it so I don't know what I'm going to
wear with this one yet but I'll just
keep a lookout for something in my
cupboard or I'll just go buy something
else to wear with this the last thing
that I have to show you guys and these
how I said pants right here and I love
the pattern I just think they're so
unique that's why I picked them up and
these are really really short so that's
what the only thing that I don't like
about them and they're a bit dirty at
the moment because I had fake tan on
them I have to put them in the wash but
I do think that ice has a few nice
things now you just have to keep looking
around because some things are rather
tacky
these are probably talking in some pimp
in some people's opinion because they're
so short but I really like them I don't
know how many more times and be wearing
them since they are so short but I
really like the ISIS clothing so that is
all for this haul I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you want to see more
hauls just give this video a big thumbs
up because it means so much to me and as
I said before I don't really I didn't
really have too many things to show you
guys because are not that big of a
spender when it comes to fashion because
my taste changes all the time but yeah
that is all for this video so I'll see
you soon bye so I thought I would show
you guys Lola if you watch my other
video where I showed her when she was a
baby here she is now I can't even really
lift her up she's so big um she's a
Labrador and she's so big no yeah oh my
god I can't believe how fast she's
growing but I just think she's so cute
we currently see ya know and my other
dog wants to make an appearance
so here's Toby
isn't he the ugliest thing I've ever
seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
