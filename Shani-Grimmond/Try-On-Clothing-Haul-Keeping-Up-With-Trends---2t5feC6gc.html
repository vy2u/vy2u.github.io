so in today's video I'm doing a clothing
haul I find it so funny how clothes come
in and out of like trend so quickly
that's why I love doing hauls because
you guys love to see what's up what's in
fashion now honey because there are a
lot of new trends going on so we're
going to jump right into that but first
I just want to say thank you so much for
beginning through titre sponsoring this
video

a video is from there and they have some
amazing queries and accessories and all
of that good stuff and to top it off
they are doing a Coachella giveaway
sorry I just got to it blank for a
second maybe I really want for guru-guru
jela they're giving away at two VIP
tickets to Coachella return flight to LA

serious I'll leave all the details down

the links down below if you guys are
interested in anything that I'm about to
share with you but we do have a 15% off
discount code if you guys want to save
some Tosh and you can just use the code
honey
so welcome tech let's start with these
first items so we have a white silk crop
right here this is so pretty and elegant
I love that silk is in fashion oh it's
so like flattering to the eye you don't
mean it just looks very sophisticated
and like shiny a little bit so much so
this one is high neck and it is also
backlit so all you need is some sticky
boobs or nipple covers so you can have
your whole background on display but
that does mean that you do have to turn
you back properly so you're gonna need
some help with that one tour Elise I do
just so you guys know I always get a
small from boutique so these all the
size 8 or small but yeah I think what I
went away with this is like some dress
pants and high-waisted dress pants I can
only wear how I stood or are really nice
like pencil skirt because this is very
dressy but I feel like you can dress it
down as well but for the most part I'm
probably going to wear this clubbing I
fit in every hole and like yeah I'm
gonna wear that clubbing only wear that
coming
only shuttles going clubbing next up we
have some high-waisted pants I can never
have enough high waisted pants just
because they're so comfortable and they
usually sense you around the way so
they're still very cute and classy and
you can definitely like dress them up
and down as well that's why I have it
literally a million pants but these ones
I don't like silky material again
it's not actually silk it's polyester I
just realized with the law stuff I've
shared with you as well but it is that
like shiny looks home like that so
whatever I just realized that these
pants are gonna grow perfect with the
outfit that I'm wearing right now so I'm
wearing a black leotard and a fancy
necklace have a look do I mean it looks
so good with black I'm living I know I
wear this color all the time and it's
honestly the most flattering color with
like a really nice turn so it's just
jumpsuit right here which is like a
burnt orange rust color or so hot so
just like the first crop that I showed
you it also has like the same material
and high-neck going on so it is a little
bit Foley around the booby area this one
is backless as well and it kind of
pinches around the waist so it goes
slowly on the top and then tight around
the waist and like the pants area I love
that it's not as short as normal
jumpsuit it's kind of classy on you know
because most jumpsuits they have as I
say all the time I have a long torso
into my butt cheeks hanging out but I
also like how the pants won't wear as
where's the bottom area I love how the
parents are folded at the bottom I feel
like it's really dressy and I can't wait
to wear this out and someday like going
out for drinks or something yes please
so cute for the daytime like dressy
daytime you know what I mean oh I've
been looking for this for the longest
time and here it is this is just like a
champagne slip it's like a really nice
dressy dress and you can do so many
things with this outfit so I'm going to
wear like a really nice diamond choker
with this and some really big heels and
you could wear this with so many
occasions it'd be perfect for going out
perfect for the daytime there's just so
many different ways you can rock this
look the reason why I've been looking
for this for like five hundred years is
because these kind of outfits are so
comfortable to wear and I know like
beauty is pain okay I get it
wearing like high-waisted pants that are
really tight it's like uncomfortable and
when you're eating you have to undo your
pins but beauty's pain or non-viable
time I just prefer to wear something
like this because it's so pretty and
again it's that silky look like yes
please I'm winning you could also wear a
belt with it as well if you want to like
stitch it around the waist a bit but I'm
having a flowy
yes the next thing that we have right
here is this beautiful blue dress that
it's kind of like a wraps up around the
front around your belly so you can tie
it up right there so you can make it a
little bit title you can make it nice
and flowy so
really like his color it's definitely a
lot different to what I usually wear it
kind of like a baby gray blue and I'm
pretty sure there was other colors on my
site but I'm like no I need to try a
different colored I'm sick of looking
like Plain Jane in my white and blacking
there are a lot of things in this video
won't let me I had to be a little bit
cheeky and get this top because it
actually reminds me of an old friend of
mine
it says 99 problems but a bitch ain't
one
fun does a hunt but it doesn't snitch
ain't one which is like the perfect talk
like represents all my old friends
things hmm no but seriously I love these
basic tees just because you can like
tied up around the belly and adds a lot
of structure there or you're tied up at
all if you think bloated or something
like me 24/7 but I love to wear the tied
up basic tees with denim high-waisted
skirts or denim how its appearance it
looks so good I will kind of one like
this to Justin Bieber and oh so good all
those niches can fly away things me and
it also got another basic tear as well
this one's like a bright white color and
it has a few details on the back right
here I still have a few more clothes to
share with you but before I do that I
need to show you these bikinis because
they're so nice I've been really
obsessed with this like washed out baby
pink lately or just gives me life it's
not like a hot pink so it's not tacky
but it's that beautiful like Mavi pink
you know so this is what the bottoms
look like and then the toe oh I feel
like you're wear this to a best of all
this would look so good as just like a
top and like just I want is everywhere
oh this one kind of looks like a
bralette so it's really going to hold
the boobs in and actually have support
which is great because my boobs do fall
out the beach all the time especially
would like to start the plan oh my god I
can not imagine myself wearing this but
I had to get it because it looks so good
on the model on the website on my feels
clean so it pretty much is like a
button-up white tee but my favorite
thing about it just wait the back of it
is like backless it just has to sit down
the back it looks so cool so I'm pretty
sure what I'm going to do with this is
I'm going to wear
high-waisted like this dress - boyfriend
jeans have this or a pin and then have a
lot of necklaces on it's going to look
really different but also hot I can feel
it oh and then a pair of boots yeah
this is one of the first things that I
chose on the website because it's that
cute so it's one of those tops that goes
around here I can't wait to wear this is
a really soft material it's going to be
so comfortable and winter is coming
around the corner as well and it is
long-sleeve so it's going to work out
perfectly to me it's like it's not true
tight as well like a lot of ones that
kind of like wrap around here really
like hard to wear because you can't even
lift your arms up but that elastic is
like isn't restraining at all so I feel
like I'm going to be really fun to wear
off with a diamond choker I always think
about all of the like jewelry I'm going
to wear with it I never used to be a
jewelry girl at all but recently I'm
just obsessed like I always wear chokers
earrings hoop everything and like that's
just all I think about what I'm getting
closer my cool butch women because this
is flowy all the way down I'm going to
wear like high-waisted jeans or how I
stood anything really just to cut off
around my stomach so we can have that
structure around there oh yes yeah last
but not least I got two shirts that are
the same because as I said if I like
something I have to get into colors so
first we have this white one again it's
a polyester shiny material and it is a
v-neck so the reason why I love these
because you can learn so many different
ways but also I love that it has a
little adjustable clip at the back so if
you want a little bit of three be
showing you can go for a hand do what
you want or if you want it to be high
coverage you can definitely do that as
well but like I noticed when I do hold
and when I like buy all these clothes I
have all of my dresses stuff like
sitting in the back of my cupboard and
then when it comes to like just like
basic shirts I wear them all the time
like I actually get a lot of wear out of
them so I had to get some more of these
because I actually have a million but
I've worn them away too much and the
colors like faded and stuff so I also
got black because you can never go wrong
with black goes with everything so this
one is the exact same all this looks re
dressy if you guys can see like no light
it's so shiny sorry guys just realized
that I didn't actually film an outro so
hope you guys liked this video
Angelle see you my next video and I'll
do an outro next time thank you love me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
