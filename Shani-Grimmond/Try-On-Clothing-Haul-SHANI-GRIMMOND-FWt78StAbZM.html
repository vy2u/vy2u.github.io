channel so in today's video I'm doing a
clothing haul so make sure you stay to
the end of this video because I have a
very special announcement that I'm
really excited to ensure about so this
video is in collaboration with whitefox
boutique you guys know I've been
shopping with white box boutique for so
many years now it's literally ridiculous
I'm addicted I can't help it so I do
have a discount code for all of these
clothes that I'm about to share with you
so that code is shining and you can get
15% off so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and let's jump right in let's
start with the first piece we have this
amazing jumpsuit it is honestly the
prettiest jump theory I've ever seen in
my life
this collar just stands out so much to
me I wore it last weekend to go clubbing
it was so comfortable and the color
stands out like no other I was looking
at all the club photos and you could see
me in like the background of nearly
every photo because it is so bright I
just think this one's really unique I've
never really seen a style like this yet
so this one goes around the arms with
the elastic and then it has a tie up
lower at the front here and if they prat
the back so different fits really well I
have a size small and honestly this is
so beautiful we may have a few
reoccurring colors in this video usually
I always go for my neutrals especially
blacks but I don't think I have anything
black in this haul which I'm so proud of
myself I need to step out of that
comfort zone so the next thing that we
have here is this dress this is such a
pretty color it's like that rusted Goldy
orange color I'm down at for any warm
tone colors even if it's on my clothes
like especially my makeup I have a
really nice warm tone on today but all
my clothes I think it's just so
flattering with a nice can I love to
have a tamarisk color just looks so like
bronzy you know it all ties together
bronze makeup bronze outfit and then
chrome cancer this one is elastic around
the shoulders right here and also has
this little piece of elastic that hides
around the arm and it's just super cute
and girly and flirty flowy you know that
I don't have like this hotter material
around the border of the bottom of the
dress it doesn't just go straight down
it kind of has a little bit of shape so
I think that's nice for something
different but this one is so pretty and
comfortable it also has the elastic
around the waist as well it's really
everyone
mum's new dog she shall bootiful she
help you I also got another jumpsuit
that is a really fun color this one is a
bright orange it's literally like a
witchetty current hat
I actually love this one so this one
goes around the arms I guess it's like a
reoccurring trend that is staying in
fashion for a while now because it's
still popping and it's been around for a
while and I think it looks really pretty
and then it crosses around the front of
the chest so there is a lot going on in
this little jumpsuit I think you can
definitely dress it up and wear it out
to wear that for dinner or you can just
wear it out like going shopping
something casual for the day but there's
so many like ways you could wear this
okay so now you have something that
isn't orange so we have this green
jumpsuit right here this one is the
prettiest color I love these turns of
green so again I learned something that
was really comfortable I always refer to
my clothes like having to be comfortable
for me to wear them just because I'm
high maintenance when it comes to
clothes okay so it has to be comfortable
and this definitely is so it has like a
little elastic band around the waist but
it is super flowy yeah great for when
I'm bloated I can cover everything
that's going on down there
did you just growl at me what do you
want you're hungry you just ate dog food
doll yeah this is something that I can
definitely see myself wearing a lot the
next thing that we have right here is
this crop which I'm completely obsessive
so again this one goes around the arms
but the elastic is really stretchy so
it's not going to be too restraining all
you need to lift your arms up and then
the sleeves around the wrist area are
super flowy okay let me show you what
I'm gonna wear with this because going
to look so good here we have V this one
is a basic white denim skirt these ones
are so comfortable because the denim is
a little bit stretchy so you're not
really like stuck in there too much to
the point where you can't move the next
thing that we have right here is this a
dress shirt sounds like a camera style
if you come with a like corsets belt
kind of thing um but I'm just going to
wear it on its own because I think it's
really cute and it's really easy to wear
just check on some black boots in a
black bag and it's going to look so good
your what so now that I think of it this
is going to be the perfect outfit to
wear out in the shopping three because
you know when you're like getting
dressed a million times and it's
annoying having to like pull jeans are
poor button you showed up Chuck this on
shut it off you're good to go this is
going to be my shopping spree outfit oh
and this is what do you belt
looks like so describe this around the
waist if you want some definition around
there I also have the white dress shirt
as well but um II ran away I think it's
in a wash a white box boutique honestly
have it the best range of heels I'm
really excited to show these fun to do
this so pretty and unique so these ones
I'd like to sock heel kind of things you
know how usually came out of those and
life now every other brand has them
these are so freakin nice you know what
these are honestly the comfiest heels I
have ever worn when I got tryin to feel
like I had heels on they're not that
tall I feel like they're definitely
wearable my heel didn't break off I
didn't get blisters it was amazing so I
have a big sort of size 9 but these ones
have a pointed toe which i think is
really classy it is that suede material
so it's kind of like that fluffy feel
and the color is just so beautiful it's
like that emerald green and it looks so
good with black however to warn these
ones I honestly never thought there'd be
a day where I say heels were comfortable
but there you go so the next day we have
are these ones right here I have been
looking for this exact shoe for the
longest time ever since I was in LA
would quality which was last November so
here we have a my finally got them I
just think that like clear plastic vibe
that we have going on is so cool and
different and kind of like edgy so this
one is like rose gold features we have
rose gold here around the rim the zipper
and then in the middle of the field so I
was talking to you girl from Instagram
as you do it for like a few hours and
then I saw that they all have these
shoes and like I usually need to find
them when I was shopping on white box
they had them up like pinky delivering
the goods so these ones are the really
high booth I never thought I'd see
myself wearing these but they look so
good on again these ones are that slave
material it is a really nice nude color
and again we have a peep toe so I'm
gonna go get a pedicure
literally generation so my toes right
now they're disgusting these ones do you
go past the knees so I'm gonna have to
find something that is kind of shorter
maybe that um denim white skirt down
there that would work really well
because then would have a little bit of
skin showing in between so it's not like
clashing too much but these are gorgeous
now it's time to be a special
announcement which I'm so excited to
finally talk about so as you guys know I
collaborated with White Sox not too long
ago on a bunch of different bikinis and
I think they looked so amazing and a lot
of people were emailing whitefox saying
are you going to bring them back in
stock and we did so all of the best
sellers are back on the website or in
stock so I'll leave them linked down
below of course and the most exciting
part is we have three new colors in
three of my favorite styles okay so the
first one that we have here is the
Hampton black one-piece the white
Hampton one piece was by far one of the
best sellers so of course we had to
bring the white one back in stock and we
also brought a black one in I love this
because you can wear it as a top not
only just swimmers and I just think it
looks so classy and I love the way it
sits on the body it's just such a unique
style and then the next nude set that we
have right here are the same as the
Oasis - style so this is the one that
has the four plots at the back and then
the two plaques on the side of the
bottom so we thought would bring it in
in the mob color because this is so
poppin I love this color of bikinis I
would have to say this and the one piece
is my favorite especially in case you
guys missed the first collaboration
video that I did with black box and can
I tell you why I love all of the bottoms
on these and those because you can
really pull them up past the hips if you
want that like Kylie Jenner look but you
can wear it normally like this if you'd
prefer but I just black helps like kind
of versatile so yeah this is a very like
easy bikini to wear I love the basic
banjo is it founder or bandru I've never
been able to say it but I just love that
like basic look around the front and
then these sides have a little bit of
detail with that we also have the
original print of this style back in
stock which is like the Python white
look which is so pretty about you guys
can decide what you like better so
because I love it Vindi so much I had to
bring back the indie bikinis except I
brought them out in like a all of the
green color which I wanted to do for so
long ever since to start but I kind of
had to choose between like certain
colors and there was enough style for me
to choose this color so I'm so happy we
did repeat so I could get this one so if
style is very cheeky which is actually
really a motivating me to go to the gym
right now I just started doing squats
for the first time in so long and
actually made my butt feels so good like
I gotta look good in these two here's
what the
looks like so these ones I kind of like
the most basic ones of the lot but I
just think these are so easy to wear and
I love the color of them am I going to
rather to wear these so there we have
the whole video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and like the clothes I am
obsessed with them and especially all
the bikinis so just so you guys know if
that is the last of the key knees once
these ones that sold out we're not
bringing them back again that is all of
them but just so you guys know I did see
you all tagged me in the photos from the
bikinis you bought from the last Elise
and you all looked so amazing it
honestly warmed my heart so much to see
all of those photos it was just so weird
like to see us creating something like
from a piece of paper to then see people
actually wearing it like it was so
surreal and I love you guys so much
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already I love you and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
