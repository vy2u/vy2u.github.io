so in today's video I'm doing a clothing
haul with one of my favorite brands in
the entire world
and that is a white fox through teeth
I've been shopping with them because so
long as you guys would know by now so I
do have like so many things to share
with you so let's go ahead and jump in
and before we do that I just want to say
I do have a 15% off discount code if you
guys are interested in using it and that
is just shiny my name let's do this I
want to start with the accessories
because I'm so excited about them but
this is the first necklace that I have
right here I've never really been a
necklace girl but when I saw this I was
like oh yes
Shelley serious right now this is so
beautiful I love how it's so late and it
has so many different things going on
this would definitely have to be like
the prettiest necklace I've ever seen
I'm so excited to wear this like every
day of my life oh my god so if you guys
didn't know Kylie Jenner and ki
collaborated together to make some
really stylish glances I'm really
excited I'm lon
I guess are enough China oh these are so
cool although I do have crooked ears
like that's a problem I need to bend all
my sunnies there we go
I mean little I feel like reflecting on
it but all these remind me of a Chanel
glasses wow I love this so much oh my
god so we have the exact same style but
in a matte black frame these ones are so
amazing
these remind me a lot of the Saline how
they go like straight at the top I love
that look I think it's so classy oh my
god why my ears crooked see how I
literally picked up all of this stuff
like an hour ago that's how excited I am
right now so this one is a jumper dress
stark white I love this so much although
every time I do a white guess wrong but
like beauty is pain in my right so what
I'm going to do with this one is tie a
belt around the waist to cinch it
anytime I want it to be like a little
bit more dressy but then other times
where I want to be like more comfortable
but still keep I'm going to wear this
with some I think my foots or something
so my high heel boots but this is so
beautiful if you guys have been
following like this fashion trend lately
pink is so in at the moment so I got
that same jumper dress in pink as well
and I think this is what I'm going to
wear the most out of like everything
that we have I'm wearing this tomorrow
actually thinking oh my god this is so
beautiful and the color as well
you serious this is like the most
vibrant bread bread well the most
vibrant a red color I have ever seen and
it just makes my tan pop so I'm like
really happy about that and I love the
UM the style of it as well it has like
that underlay over here and it looks
sort of good on and then I got these
bottoms as well which are a little bit
cheeky just how I like it and then you
can pull it up on the side right here
which is what I'm going to do I do that
was like every pair of the corner okay
is this actually swimwear I'm really
intrigued oh my god it is okay so this
is a velvet or one piece it is the
coolest thing I've ever seen I'm really
like excited to see how this looks in
the water but look at that that is so
extra
are you kidding this is like me in a
bikini it's super soft and I can't wait
to rock this like literally everyone
something like what is that and I'm
going to be like I'm Beyonce
thank you very much the next thing that
I have right here is a beautiful
jumpsuit this one is sort of a classy
anything that's like that yellowy orange
color I'm taking I've been obsessed with
this car lately and you stand out like a
sore thumb
which is what you want right so this one
is a low cut down the boobs and also has
this piece miserable all on this piece
of material to tie around the waist even
though it is cinched around here anyway
but it's like a little belt I'm super
excited about this one so this one is a
burgundy little set so this is the top
and then we have the high-waisted
bottoms I've never really only think
that's master I think it's like super
cool and I'm excited to see it's like
more mesh things coming style but I love
this color so much but I really liked
how the top is kind of like a bralette
cutouts which has like that loop shape
to it to make it like look a bit more
classy than just like a normal crop you
know I mean speaking of a really
classics is literally one of the
prettiest sets I have ever seen this is
like a champagne silk set so we have the
dress pants and then the like silk thing
that ties around the blue area and you
can tie off in so many different ways so
these ones are high waisted and they're
fitted around the waist and then they're
a little bit flowy all the way down to
the ground that be oh you have to get a
stain with our I feel like this is
something you watch like a birthday or
something really extravagant or even if
you don't look quite like just where I
find as you guys know I pretty much live
in comfortable clothes so I had to get
some comfy pieces this is just a gray
short little dress and it has
on the side right here this has been in
like a lot lately with like all the rips
down the side the next thing that we
have is this top that I wearing right
now and I'm so obsessed with it this is
what it looks like I like to wear it off
like the shoulder kind of like this and
I love how it's like a freehand cut like
I think it is but like it rolls down
like that
I freaking love the way that looks it
looks like sort effortless and just keep
unique okay so the last thing that we
have is this code right here that
literally feels like a shape it's so
nice and warm this one goes down past
the knees and I just think it will dress
up like a little outfit let me just tell
you that this is going to come in handy
a lot and I really love this like nude
color right here I'm obsessed with nude
