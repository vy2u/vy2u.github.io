channel so in today's video I'm gonna
doing a clothing haul I'm so excited
because I haven't done one in the
longest time and I got all of these
clothes at yesterday and I was like holy
crap I'm obsessed with everything I
tried them on straight away and I was
like oh I just love new clothes like I
am obsessed and I need to relax but I
can't I just keep getting more clothes
and more clothes and I'm like it's never
enough for me so everything in this
video is from whitefox boutique if you
guys didn't know I've been literally
shopping with them since I was in high
school wow that actually is such a long
time I need to seriously take a step
back and reevaluate my life anyways if
you want anything is that I'm gonna be
talking about in this video I'll make
sure to leave everything down in the
description below and I also have a 15%
off discount code if you guys are
interested in saving some dosh if you
want to buy anything so my code is sha
and I SHINee I'll leave that down there
below as well but let's go ahead and
jump right into the video okay so here
we have the first pair of shoes right
here so it's kind of like a see-through
mesh material on the sides and then it
has the whole lace-up down the whole
foot so I'm actually obsessed with these
shoes I just think that's so different
like I just have the most basic pair of
heels that I wear all the time I'm like
I need to have something that's like a
little bit more of a statement piece so
I think these are absolutely perfect and
they're from the brand Bellini as well
so these ones are pretty affordable you
know what these are mami of the shoes of
white chicks and when they get out of
the car it's like zooming up on their
body I'm pretty sure they're wearing
these next we have true pairs of slides
the same slides but in different color
because you know when you love something
that much you've got to buy like old
shades here we go this is a perfect
example sir again these ones are from
the brand Bellini they're the nicest way
to wear flat shoes that aren't thongs so
we have the black and then we also have
like the really light nude color I have
really bad happened I always think I
just need a tie cause I'm thinking about
food all the time okay so the first
thing that we have is a basic I love
this one so much this one is a ribbed
leotard it has these really pretty like
iridescent buttons that go up the middle
and if you want a little bit more boobie
of course it can go ahead and
he's down you know I'm joking that girl
I have a size 8 and everything if you
guys were wondering about that but yeah
this one is definitely gonna get a lot
of wear I love wearing basics like this
speaking of basics we have another one
and I just had to get this because I
knew this is something that I would
actually wear all the time because it's
so comfortable and it's really cute as
well so it's just a great rest and it
has this little tie up thing at the back
that you bring around the front and you
can really cinch your waist so you can
like make it super tight if you want to
make it more dressy and like Keaton you
know snatched or you can wear it loose
it's just like super comfy oh ho you
guys this is one of my favorites out of
the whole collection that I have right
in front of me so this one is a black
long jump suit it goes down to the
ground and it has a split on the side of
the legs and I love tops or like play
suits or whatever
they go straight across at the boob area
I just think it looks so classy and I'm
loving those veins at the moment so this
one has a zipper at the back it just
fits really well and if you want you can
chuck a belt on with this to add you
know something a little bit different to
it
oh speaking of belts I picked up a black
and a nude belt I feel like these are
the two belts that everyone needs in
their life just to like break up colors
of your outfit just to add a little bit
more personal so this is like a faux
leather and I had like the gold buckles
obsessed but anyways let's move on to
the next thing this was another one of
my favorites I just feel like this one's
so formal and so classy
of course I'm probably just going to
wear this clubbing because I don't have
any effect that's coming up oh oh my
earrings fully twisted relaxed so this
one is a white play suit once again
white usually place you're just don't
fit me with this fit perfectly I just
realized it's a size small tree usually
I have to go a size bigger when I'm
wearing like play suits because my torso
is so long but this actually worked
really well so this is like a little
v-neck is that way cool I don't
specialize in fashion I'm sorry but I
really like how it has these two like
elastic strings that come up around here
I just think it like it adds something a
little bit different to the outfit so as
you can see this string is really long
and what you do is you just tie it
around your waist and it just makes it
look that extra bit more classy and this
one has like really nice thick material
as well so you can tell it's like a
really nice formal kind of outfit why
all my hair is so flat
so this one is another one of my
favorites it is a rib to set this one's
like a white ivory kind of color wait is
it what no it's actually what sorry I
lied
oh no it's definitely a tinge of like
ivory no I really like this one so it's
like a ribbed cotton kind of feel I mean
I don't know if it's cotton let's find
out
yeah majority of it is cotton so it's
that really soft comfortable material so
these are the high-waisted pants they
come up really nice and high which I
love and it covers your butt cheeks
which I also really really appreciate
here's my butt cheeks don't like to be
at so the next thing that we have is
another basic so this is a ribbed
leotard I have this in black but I had
to get in white so it has like all the
buttons here again you can undo them we
can leave them up I actually think this
one looks really good done up but if you
are gonna get this in white I would
definitely recommend you know wearing a
like a nipple covers or be a new
strapless bra otherwise we might see a
little bit of a nip which I personally
don't have a problem with but I think it
looks cute alright so the next thing
that we have is sorkin cute I feel like
I'm gonna be living in this oh my god
you guys we're gonna kill me for saying
that about everything but like seriously
so this is a little set and it has green
and red down the sides do I do I see
like Gucci vibes okay or do I feel
Christmas vibes I'm not sure oh my gosh
and the pants are incredible so they're
just like black high-waisted trackie
kind of pants again with this down the
side and then it has the silver buttons
as well so if you want undo them you can
kind of have them open or I think these
would look amazing tucked in like these
actually the boots that I shared with
you guys before I buried in all the
other clues about the boots that I've
shared with you guys at the start I feel
like if you tuck these into those brutes
or any black boots I feel like it would
just dress it up so much or obviously
you can wear it super casually I have a
lot of pants to share with you guys
because I always get so many talks but I
never get pants so I'm like I need to
get a lot of pants so the first one that
we have right here are these
high-waisted of black dress pants these
ones have a split down the side so I
think it adds that little bit of like
extra Ness to the pants
Wow I need to go back to school so this
materials like polyester so it's super
light but it's that really nice dressy
material sorry I feel like I'm gonna get
a lot of wear out of these ones so the
next ones that we have are linen these
ones are more fitted at the top so
they're nice and high way so they've
sent you in around the waist and then
they go more of like a flare like flowy
style around like the shin ankle kind of
area but they're so flattering I just
think they're really beautiful and I
love how this super high-waisted not
just like hit her under the belly button
they're definitely above the belly
button and they suck everything in so
I'm really happy with that and you know
me I had to get the same style in white
as well I just feel like this is such
like a beachy clean like chic vibe let's
move on to some tops so the first thing
that we have here is a body suit and
when I first open this I completely
forgot about everything that I got
because I have short-term memory loss
and I was like wait is this a swimsuit
it's not it's a top but I feel like you
definitely could wear it as it oh no you
could and that would be so dangerous if
that popped open it's just that like a
really soft swim through kind of
materials sorry this is like a really
nice green color and did I get it in
another color I thought I did but oh my
god I did never doubt yourself so I also
got it in white as well because you can
never go wrong with too much white in
your wardrobe so I'm happy about that
but I really like how it like whole it's
my boobs in like there's no chance of
any sort of like tit pop and when you do
have big boobs you know that's always
something you've got to look you can
look out for because let's just say
that's happened a few times to me the
next thing that we have is another
leotard Wow and you should relax on the
leotards so this one is one of those
straight cuts at the top I just I love
it and then the reason why I was like I
have to get this now is because it has
these really thin spaghetti straps and
it's like that really stretchy material
I've no I just feel like it looks
started classy when the straps is super
thin I've always have asking for
spaghetti straps I don't know why but
anything with like thin straps I'm like
yes please thanks so much for coming and
I also go to in black as well because it
bears with everything let's just say I
went a little bit crazy with body suits
okay so the next thing that we have is
kind of similar to the white jumpsuit
with you guys before with the two straps
on both sides he also again this one is
a bodysuit with like the low v-neck
right here and then these strings tie up
around the belly alright so the next
thing that we have is this really pretty
mustard colored dress now I love things
that's high up on the side right here so
you can really make them nice and tight
or we can make them loose and just wear
them really comfortably I don't really
know how you guys are gonna like this
color because it's something that you
either love or you hate it's a walking
banana so this is a skirt I was just
checking if it with Scotts again this
one ties up on the side right here but
as soon as I saw this color I was like I
have to get it this makes you look so
tan and it just pops so much okay so
next up we have a white place suit this
one is super cute
and it's really comfortable I'm really
happy that it's one of those jumpsuits
where everything is kind of like tucked
away but it's still super cute and short
and stuff like that this one ties up
around the boob area and then it has the
attached like high-waisted pants looking
above to the front of them so that's
super cute Nora we only have one more
outfit left so this is a beautiful black
so he looking kind of dress it's
polyester but it's you know that's silky
looking vibe which I'm loving so it
looks like this it's just literally a
simple black like flowy dress I'm gonna
wear a belt with it to cinch it around
the waist but I want to sleep eating
like trying to get my hands on this
dress so like I thinking and now I'm
pretty sure it's this one and it was
always sold out but I just love the way
it looks it's just one of those outfits
that's super comfortable but still looks
bum anyways guys there we have the
finished whole I really hope you guys
