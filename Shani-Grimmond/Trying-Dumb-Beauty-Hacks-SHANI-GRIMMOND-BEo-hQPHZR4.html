my channel so in today's video I'm going
to be trying some dumb beauty hacks that
I've seen all over Instagram Pinterest
everywhere I just thought let's put to
the test a lot of them I feel like I'm
going to be a waste of my time because
they're that dumb but I want to try it I
think it'll be fun so I have a lot of
just like a random thing sitting right
here and we're just going to go ahead
and drop straight into it I've never
tried any of these things before and I'm
not expecting this video to be a
life-changer in any way shape or form so
let's go ahead and jump straight into it
so let's start with some makeup hacks
the weirdest one that I have seen is
applying your foundation with a sock
that is rolled up and I'm assuming
people are thinking of it as a Beauty
Blender so I'm going to take some
foundation and pump it on my sock so I'm
going to make sure it's a nice little
tight ball like this this is the
weirdest thing I've ever done in my life
all right let's do this I don't really
know what to expect
hmm I mean it's not that bad for a sock
it's actually blending kind of evenly on
my face we just say rest in peace to
these socks because ain't wearing these
again oh my god this is actually working
what the hell right well looks like we
have to put our fifth pump foundation on
because this sock is literally eating up
my foundation I wonderful work like damn
if I oh wow that's a lot because you
know how beauty blenders you're supposed
to wet them if this is supposed to be
like a Beauty Blender maybe I should
quit it so this is what it looks like
close up
it definitely has like a pretty good
finish you definitely can see a lot of
black holes that are from the sock and
it's just like not going on completely
smooth but I mean we are applying our
foundation with a sock I was expecting
this to go much much worse could you
imagine that going your friends house is
like oh I forgot my foundation brush let
me just whip out a sock all I'm saying
is I ain't mad at that sock
I can already say I'm a hundred percent
sure you guys have seen this floating
around YouTube because people do it all
the time it is putting a semi red color
lipstick under your eyes as you can see
to cancel out the purpley blue tones and
then of course you put a concealer on
the top to get rid of the red tones from
elastic I personally think it just seems
a little bit excessive and repetitive
like why do you want to put red under
your eyes when you can just go ahead and
put a peachy concealer under there to
get rid of the dark circles it's just
all about the trends isn't it
so I'm going to take like an orangey
shade and Pat it really lightly under
the eyes I see people literally like
drawing bright red and bright orange on
the eye so I'm going to try and keep
this lack as realistic as possible this
is going to be interesting looking good
so far
okay taking the red tone up a little bit
a little bit of this one on cuz I'm
pretty sure it has to be like peachy so
I've got my little sponge here and I'm
just going to go ahead and blend this
out not going to lie it looks like I
have some sort of eye disease and I
don't really know how to feel about this
I've then looks like I just got punched
in the eyeball next step is to put some
concealer right over the top and I'm
going to do it on the other eye as well
to see if there is any difference at all
or if we're just wasting our life right
here
well I mean at least the orange is gone
nope
still weird so here's a little close-up
this is a side we put the orange and red
and this is a side put just the plain
concealer on its own to be completely
honest I can't tell a difference at all
but at least the orange is covered when
your face doesn't match your neck
because you try a new 10 and it is
disgusting I'm sure you've probably seen
a lot of spoons in the makeup world
recently people like to do a lot of
crazy things with these things um
apparently you can contour this fringe
so let's give it a shot I'm just going
to use a cream concealer to contour
under here so I believe you just like
line it up with your jawbone and it's
kind of like a guide I mean I can't ever
wonder a straight line like that though
well let's blend it out I don't see how
this is any different to just
free-handing it I'm not going to lie
this actually looks really good if you
place it awake and feel the end of your
cheekbone you're going to get the exact
line where you want to contour so I mean
it is a good idea but is it worth being
a spring dirty not really on the other
side I'm going to try and contour with a
bit of tape so we're going to keep this
line nice and harsh so firstly I'm going
to get most of the sticky stuff off on
the back of my hand otherwise it's
obviously going to take all my
foundation off either way it's going to
take my foundation I'll flip cereal
let's pop it on under the cheekbone you
want to define djor just go get yourself
some tape not going to lie I'm really
really excited to pull this off because
I love a strong contour I really do and
this stops it from going anywhere down
past your cheekbones so let's peel it
off the big reveal the big reveal well I
guess it's time to blend it out I don't
really think there's any point on adding
the tape because if you're going to take
it off and blend around it anyway I mean
all the foundation and contour is like
mixing together here so you may as well
just bake next tak is some mascara and
some cotton wool for some I guess you
could call them eyelash extensions so
I'm going to start
by hurting my lashes with mascara then
with my little cotton ball I'm just
going to pull a bit of fluff out and yes
I had to buy a whole bag of cotton balls
just for this much fluff but I mean it's
worth it I mean well I hope it's worth
it so I'm just going to pull it apart
and then I'm going to get my slowly
rusher in there coat my lashes while the
mascara is wet hello why you're not
going on how gorgeous is this yeah I
mean we've got a few lash extensions
there let's try and tint them black I
feel like it's just gonna come straight
off I literally have one long eyelash
right here really impressed with that I
feel like it would just be a lot easier
to stick on a false lash okay so the
next one is kind of an interesting one I
haven't seen too many people do this so
I don't really have high expectations
you take some translucent powder and you
brush it in your lashes before you put
mascara on and apparently it adds like
little fibers and make sure lashes that
extra a little bit thicker so I'm going
to go ahead and take mascara off this
eye does anyone else get really bad vo
when they fake tan that's just me let's
put this to the test I'm going to take
my spoolie and just rub it around in my
translucent powder this is so fun I feel
like a scientist time to create those
lashes oh oh it's just falling straight
into my eye it's making my lashes
non-existent so as you can see on this
side this is a translucent powder and
this one is with the cotton but there's
no cotton on there so it's basically
just normal skaara
and I feel like this side is a lot
thicker but it's like if you're not
translucent powder on your lashes then
you're going to coat them with mascara
all the powder is just going to get into
mascara and ruin it and you kind of just
like losing your money because
that's not cheap honey apparently you
can use honey as lip gloss actually this
is a really good idea because obviously
honey is really slimy but it's really
sticky but I mean if you're gonna lip
gloss let's just go to our carbon and
get some honey to buy this with $7 okay
the taste of honey you know what I'm
gonna do I'm just gonna kiss this and
hope for the best
here goes nothing oh my god this is the
shiniest lip gloss I've ever seen in my
life if I could vomit right now I would
this is disgusting and it's so sticky so
it's running all down my lips right here
outside and see how this can work in any
way shape or form as you can see it's
just dripping down my lips we're going
old-school again and bringing out the
scotch tape so I've seen people do this
a lot I just know apparently you can
make your eyebrows super sharp and you
don't have to be neat or anything cause
you can pretty much just like color in
your whole eyebrow but this is going to
stop it from going on the skin so I'm
gonna start by taking a little bit here
a little bit here I'm going to take a
little bit of my Anastasia dip brow
pomade and just go crazy I mean we can
go crazy because there's tape there
right oh my god I think this is actually
working like really easy I'm good
I think I went a little bit overboard
how this is numbers on sleek my eyebrows
have ever looked there's actually an
arch there let's see a little cycle I'm
just gonna brush through my brows a
little bit just to soften it feel like I
put the whole job the Paint Pot in up my
eyebrows but that's okay I'm just gonna
take it in smaller section so I can kind
of make a little arch oh no don't grab
my lash geez I need them okay I'm gonna
leave that middle pot empty oh my god
it's like I've had some sort of Botox or
something mmm
all right let's go in Michael that line
is so sharp I love it
guys this looks so cool hairspray as a
makeup setting spray I'm not gonna lie I
haven't done this before when I was
around 15 16 I used to go to like a
backyard parties and dance all night and
my friend was like you should put this
on your face make sure makeup sounds so
much longer and I was like sure every
time I did at my face literally was so
stiff my foundation and everything was
on perfectly by the end of the night but
you break out really bad it is so bad
for your skin but I mean to buy a makeup
setting spray it's about $30 and I'm
pretty sure this is like $10 so I'm
kidding I wouldn't recommend but I'm
just going to show you how stiff it
makes your face have you guys ever
wanted instant Botox here it is all
right I think that's enough for me with
the hairspray wouldn't recommend this
guys honestly your pores and your skin
is gonna hate you after you do this but
it works but so does makeup setting
spray so let's just stick to that option
shall we now let's move on to a few hair
hacks so I've seen this one everywhere
it is putting your bobby pin in the
middle of your ponytail to make it stick
up more so instead of it being flat like
that it's going to come up like this and
have more volume the only reason I put
this in dumb beauty hacks is because how
is that not going to give you a headache
it's just poking into your head oh well
the things I do for you guys so I'm
going to split it in half and then I'm
just gonna poke it in there ah it's
poking my scalp how is this supposed to
be painless really oh my god that
actually is so much volume guys look at
that but isn't really worth the pain is
it what better that it puts you in
literally instantly it's like just Jabby
in imagine if you like jumping around
and then your bow pins are just out and
your has flat and it's just like hello
alright well the next one involves a
straightener this could be dangerous so
what I'm going to do is plat my hair in
2p tails then I'm going to straighten my
plat and apparently you get waves I've
seen all over the internet but I mean
and no let's test it up it's so hard to
make facial expressions with a stiff
face you know what I'm really scared
that my hair is going to fall out after
this because using a curling one you
only have to put on there for like 10 to
15 seconds drop it out but I feel like
this one is literally just gonna burn it
off because you've got to hold it there
for a little bit for it to actually yeah
for it to actually work this is so scary
I'm just gonna run it down oh and by the
way this is why I don't do hair
tutorials
I can't even plat okay so I'm gonna pull
my hair out gently it literally looks
like my plasters being flattened like a
truck has just ran over it let's see how
this looks you know what at least I
tried I have a tiny bit of texture right
here I mean I was pretty cool but what
about all the hair that's in the middle
of the plat so there we have my trying
dumb beauty hacks video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and learnt something
I'm getting there's nothing to learn in
this video except that they're all dumb
and they're all wasted time except the
eyebrow one that's pretty cool if you
want a really sharp arch just get some
scotch tape if you guys liked this video
please give it a big thumbs up because
it helps me out so so much I love you
guys so much and I'll see you very soon
