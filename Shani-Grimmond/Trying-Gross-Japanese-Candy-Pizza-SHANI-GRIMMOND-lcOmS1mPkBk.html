probably going to be the most random
video you've ever seen in your life I'm
making Japanese pizza from scratch all
the peas and everything I'm making it by
myself and also some ice cream cones it
doesn't have any instructions on it and
I don't know how else is going to go so
let's start with the pizza so this is
what they're giving us all these packets
and a mixing table in a cup this is
going to be interesting so I'm going to
start with this orange packet because
it's the biggest out of the lot oh my
god I literally ran out to do so I'm
just gonna open it you all stink so I'm
going to pour it in this little tub
right here this is so random so this is
what it looks like I'm just going to
pour some water in it and hope for the
best
oh that was too much water wow that is
so good
yo this has to be the base of the pizza
it looks like actually woman not going
to lie it smells like um cake better I
think I could actually enjoy this
alright looks good ok so just gonna
flatten that base out to make a
perfectly circle pizza it stinks now
okay well I put so much water in there
that has to be like the cheese or
something I'm guessing this is cheese it
looks so disgusting so I'm going to
spread this on my pizza as the base oh
my god now opening the brown packet oh
that smells like chicken well I'm going
to scoop my barbecue sauce or my chicken
sauce whatever this is onto my pizza
because you can never have enough
flavoring am i right let's just put that
on the side and that can be like our
sauce oh my god that one smells so good
eyes for the perk one in and it smells
like bubble gum but what kind of lead
bonbon flavor doesn't walk Pizza
right oh I think that's a soft drink
it's fizzy oh maybe that's what the cup
is for mmm
all right so we've got our drink ready
our pizzas looking at freakin good
especially that sauce
Oh gorgeous peas and corn that looks
appetizing well I guess I'm just going
to put the peas and corn in the
microwave as well to soften them up
because they're rock-hard ten seconds
ten nine eight seven six five four three
two let's put some healthy veggies on
our pizza since when do you put peas and
corn on pizza anyway Oh
all right last packet is the red one
let's see what's inside this line or
mobile that's to move pace that's first
to go under everything oh I'm not a good
cook if only you guys could smell this
right now all right well I guess I'm
going to pull the tomato paste on top
orders up let's have some pizza and a
drink with some dipping sauce okay well
just cut off a little bit of our pizza
I'm going to dip it in my sauce now I'm
going to eat it
Oh texture
I've actually never tasted something so
disgusting
in my life that piece of corn was so
crunchy as like as it tastes like of
noodles mixed with like of chicken off
everything of corn sniffs me to be rude
I made this feed bin but it's really
yummy I haven't tried it myself
she's like sticking her nose up to it so
rude okay I'm having some so deal with
it now cheers guys
smells like bubblegum think I can deal
with this one I think I can oh I just
got a chunk of face in my mouth it
tastes like flat grape soda juice or
something not bad now time to make some
cream oh my god I'm so excited at this
one because I have a feeling it might
not be that bad
I mean how bad could ice cream test well
first of all this is cheap this is
 cute this is my ice cream cone
it's go ahead and make this oh my god
there's only two packets as well living
is for dumb people like me all right
everything the pink packet I'm going to
put this in one side oh my god cute it's
like very pink color okay I'm going to
start by putting a little bit of water
another time because I don't want to
 up my ice cream all I want it even
comes a little sprinkle all right let's
mix this with one hand yep
it's possible yeah okay okay this is
what my ice cream looks like all that
smells so young it has a tube I can
freeze my ice cream in to the ice cream
