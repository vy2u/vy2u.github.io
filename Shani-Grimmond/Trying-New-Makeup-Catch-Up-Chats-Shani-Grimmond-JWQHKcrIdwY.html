god I'm so excited to be sitting down
and filming a video I have so many new
makeup products that I really want to
play around with and I just want to talk
to you guys and update you with my life
I feel like it's been so long since I've
literally just relaxed with you guys and
chatted chatted whoo okay let's go ahead
and jump into the makeup let's go ahead
and start with the eyebrow so I'm taking
the wet-and-wild ultimate brow kit this
one is in the shade ash brown and I kind
of feel like I'm in between both of
these two shades like that one is way
too dark for me and that's why tea
lights or I might just mix them together
then how's that sound
that's right powdery alright let's see
how this oh wow that's pretty pigmented
so as most you guys would know I just
got back from America oh my god it's so
hard to talk while I'm doing my brows I
just got back from the US and I
literally had so much fun I love it over
there so much but honestly nothing is
better than being in Australia like I
love Australia very much I just think
Australia is like the best place in the
world but it's nice to go overseas for
holidays and stuff but I'm just started
happy to be back and have all of my
friends back and just have left like go
back to normal I did get really upset
when I got back from holiday because
it's really hard like going from being
with people every single day true being
alone like oh my god it was like
horrible I love having my alone time but
after a breakup it's like just gets
really hard because you have to adjust
not having that person in your life and
I think that's why I've been well that
is why I have been so upset but I'm
pulling through and I'm really happy and
I'm doing well it was just like a few
days that were I was really upset but I
feel good now I wouldn't say the best
browsers ever done but not bad
yeah the next step is to carve out my
eyebrows so I'm using the Amalfi and 4:3
to brush and a bit of top shape tip
concealer am I going peanuts run it
Sneaky's little bat head in here pika
this literally makes the brows look so
clean
and of course I'm gonna cover up all of
those veins so we couldn't even to be
eye shadow alright now it's time for the
eye shadow so I'm taking it Nullah yeah
Natasha Turner
Lila palette this is what it looks like
right here it's so beautiful I'm gonna
take this color right here I'm gonna
start this as my transition color I kind
of want to do this like purpley green on
my lid
but I also want to do this gold like I
don't know let's just start with the
transition shade on my brother's hair in
my lash I think he oh sorry pigment ish
it's looking a bit patchy though I don't
like that formula I really don't
oh my god it's sorry patchy what the
hell call you Michael
face times change they're like calling
turn it's so weird this palette the
purple one from etosha de no no yeah
have you used it oh my god I literally
just tried to blend out my eyeshadow and
I should have listened to you
alright just so dumb confirm that cuz I
thought it was me being a bank huh
alright I'll talk to you soon then he
literally says rock on 24/7 now he's
 like how much he says it oh my
god this post
honestly frustrating me so much okay
anyways let's move on to the next call
because I really want to see if I can
make this work so I'm gonna take this
burgundy color right here and use this
in my crease I feel like we definitely
need some warmth as well looks a bit
bruised
next up I'm gonna take some fix+ right
on my brush and then I'm gonna go in
with the lid color and I'm gonna take
this greeny blue color right here I
meant
granny pebble it's so pretty I am trying
to do a daytime look but like whatever
mmm it's not overly pigmented we go why
this pellet start bad usually like it's
not bad okay so next I'm gonna go in
with my NYX HD primer base and I'm gonna
need a brush for the Sun here we go I'm
just gonna shake it up because it's
really separated and I'm gonna put a bit
on the back of my hands about this one
from LA oh my god it's blue Wow
I have a feeling this is gonna make my
face like really wide oh well it kind of
feels like a moisturizer I hate the fact
that it doesn't look at my face I hate
it okay so I have this Stila stay all
day foundation and concealer and Siri I
have the shades three and thirteen so I
need to mix the two together to make the
perfect concoction so I'm just gonna
pump out a lot and put it on the back of
my hand and then just like mix the true
colors not bad there's a lot of
foundation
oopsy-daisy I'm just gonna blend this in
I put so much on you wow it's very full
coverage it's covering everything it's
kind of thick too okay wow this
foundation is a very very matte kind of
makes my face look a bit flat I don't
really like the finish of it
okay so Cielo I'm gonna take the
Milani retouch and arrays light lifting
concealer I have the shade at medium
alight and I'm gonna need this under my
eyes to like brighten everything up
because that color of the foundation is
disgusting but anyways let's try to fix
that in a blend this out I feel like
literally nothing is going to replace my
Tarte shaped add concealer it just looks
like a shoe under my eyes it's not like
covering the dark circles it's just like
making them go like a weird color like a
purple alright
Dill's let's move on to the Born This
Way setting powder I am so excited to
see if this tomorrow okay sir I'm just
going to pour a little bit in the lid
and then we're gonna bake with it let's
go in whoa it actually feels just like
the Laura mess yeah powder like it's
super fine it feels nice and light and
then for the rest of my face I'm going
in with the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
powder this one is in the shade 500 not
bad not bad i litterly always use the
same powder so I needed to get some new
ones I really don't like this foundation
it's like so stiff on my face
I'm just gonna brush this away I didn't
pull off and you can see loss or I'm not
mad I guess we'd have to see what it
looks like with different foundations
and everything okay so let's go ahead

vanity color and put this on my lower
lash line so we can even it out of it
