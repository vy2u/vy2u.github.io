to my channel so in today's video I'm
doing a full face of makeup using new
products I have recently got a lot of
new stuff that I really want to try out
and share my opinions with you just
before we get into this makeup look I
want to say thanks so much to our
why.com
ju for sponsoring this video they have
set me so many makeup products to try
out and I'm really excited so basically
what our Y is is like a retail website
that sells lots of makeup hair care
skincare a lot of different brands as
like drugstore and high-end and you're
gonna die they have my favourite brand
of hair products the GHD oh my god I'm
so excited about these I've been using
GHD since I was in high school I've gone
to I think 3 of them and this is by far
the nicest one I've ever got this is the
Platinum I think what is it the copper
luxe collection how amazing this is I'm
so obsessed with it I lost my other one
well I didn't lose it I left at the
hotel oh so annoying but I also got the
professional hair dryer as well
hello curious this is icon or Khalid
Oakley so the first product I'm starting
out with is the mellow cosmetics brow
pomade in the shade caramel just gonna
carve out the top of my brow up here oh
wow oh it definitely is very wet when
you apply it okay my first impression is
I don't like it at all
which is kind of disappointing because I
did try that brow powder and I really
liked it but the consistency is just too
wet and slippery and it's it's way too
hard to apply for right now I've tried
it two times and it's just not working
for me so I'm just going to do something
else and I'll be back okay so the
eyebrows are done let's go ahead and
move on to the eye shadow so I'm going
to take the jeffree star cosmetics
beauty killer palette
I've used this like once but I haven't
used on camera it was such a long time
ago so I'm excited to dive into this
palette when I first look at this I
think it's not really like my kind
of colors but I did want to get it to
see what it was like because I do like
Jeffery stars liquid lipsticks and stuff
like that so I thought this would be
good as well um let's go ahead and start
with the shade Courtney up here and
blend that in the crease these colors
are really pigmented and blend
beautifully like that just took two
seconds to blend out the next shade that
I'm taking is star power which is is
really bright pink let's give it a
swatch oh my god that is pigmented so
that color is going directly in my
crease oh my god that's such a pretty
piece this is so Jeffrey's TARDIS color
and again just taking that brown shade
and blending up here so there's no harsh
line okay so now Wow now taking some mac
prolongwear concealer in the shade and
c20 I'm just going to take a small
angled brush and line right above my
crease to make a cut crease with the
concealer all the way from inner corner
to outer corner I do this in a few
videos back but I really like the
technique and I want to show you guys
again then going in with a concealer
brush I'm just going to pack this all
over my lid so we have a nice clean cut
and then I'm going in with this gold
shade all over my lid it is so glittery
oh okay maybe I'll use my finger well
that's better
now moving on to the face I'm using the
Becca backlight primer filter this one
is from ry I have been wanting to try
this for so long oh my god it just has
like a really nice pearly iridescent oh
I'm done this is amazing
now for foundation I'm using the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting foundation in
the shade medium oh it says shake well
before you use it oh okay I mean I don't
like that because it's really messy and
really dropped it why don't they just
have a pump the first thing that I'm
noticing is the color is really nice to
my fake tan
oh my god it's blending really quickly
I'm not sure if you're supposed to use a
beauty blender or a flat top kabuki
brush but the consistency was quite
runny so I thought a beauty blender
would work best so I'd say that one
layer isn't enough for like my medium to
full coverage I want to have a bit more
of a flawless base we could definitely
still see a bit of redness through the
first layer I'm just going to blend the
rest in on my forehead with a foundation
brush so I can go around my eyebrows
first impression of this it has a
beautiful finish I love how you can see
the Becca prime I still like beaming
through it but it's patchy like I don't
know it looks a little bit patchy on my
cheeks but for now let's move on to
concealer this is the Napoleon perdus
Pro palette concealer I've never used a
polling before actually I have but I was
like a fetus so what I'm going to do
first is take this shade right here and
put this on the inner corners of my eyes
to cancel any discoloration and then I'm
just going to blend that out with my
Beauty Blender although it's blending
really nicely so as you can see from
both sides this side looks really bright
and awake so I'm really happy with that
concealer I'm also taking these two
light shades and
putting it down my nose and on my chin
and in between my brows just for a bit
of a goal or a bit about highlight you
know how it is I'm just baking under my
eyes if you guys know of any new setting
powders for under the eyes let me know
the reason why I don't have any new
products of these two is because I feel
like these are boring I like to get new
highlighters and blushes because they're
like fun now going in with this glow
minerals gold and medium pressed powder
I'm just going to use this under my eyes
a little bit because I want to highlight
oh that has a lot of coverage like glad
now it's time for the lower lash line
let's finish off the eyes so first of
all I'm going to go in with this pink
color and put this really close from the
outer corner to inner corner and then
I'll have to take another color there as
well because I don't want it to be like
too pink could look like I have pinkeye
my god this is like neon I'm just going
to take a tiny bit of the shade vanity
and put this really really close to my
lash line just so it's not all pink you
know what I mean because this is a
little look this is looking crazy I kind
of love it though then for mascara I'm
going in with the Revlon super length
mascara I haven't used this one before
oh wow that one is massive I'm just
going to zigzag this in my brows to get
all that eye shadow out I wouldn't say
this is the best mascara over the used
now just going ahead and adding some
Lily lashes I'll add my discount card
down below and I'll be right back yay
the lashes are on now let's go in with a
little bit of dye Monte's I saw a girl
on Instagram put down Monty's underneath
the eyebrow and it looked amazing I'll
insert her picture right here but I
thought I would give it a go for myself
so I'm just going to take these yellowy
gold little dry Monty's and just put
them right there I'm gonna start by
putting some eyelash glue under my brow
so they actually stick
so the diamond tees are on I actually
think they look pretty cool I didn't
have enough to go all the way across but
that's okay let's move on to the bronzer
so I'm taking this a radical instaglam
bronzing powder in 0-2 I've never heard
of this brand before this is exciting
and you open it Oh got him so this is
what the color looks like let's go in
and runs the cheeks honey
Oh oh my god that color is really nice I
love it and also around my forehead for
a bit of a sunkissed glow
I can't believe my forehead still glowy
from that back our primer usually when I
put all this powder over the top it like
just goes completely matte I'm also
going to take this steal a star light
star bright palette and I'm going to
take this bronzer shade right here
I've never mmm I've never felt anything
so soft in my life you guys ever go to a
mecca just watch these they feel
incredible so let's see what it looks
like I just want a bit of a um like a
sheen on the cheek so I thought would be
perfect
oh that is stunning oh my bad
that is a highlight that bronzer shade I
put it all over my bronzer always bring
my bronzer cooler on this side so I'm
just gonna clean that up right there now
time for blush I'm going in with this
gorgeous Cosmetics palette
oh so this one has some highlighting
shades for like under the eyes and then
highlighting shades for up here and then
some blushes so the blush that I'm gonna
use is I think this one right here just
gonna put that on the apples of my
cheeks oh that is very pigmented oh I
like it stunning let's go ahead and
brush off this baked Oh crispy clean
that is let's get ready for some
highlighter spraying my mac fix+ on this
brush and the highlighter that i'm using
today is from glow minerals in the shade
lust
this is a shimmer brick it has four
different highlighters in here and they
look absolutely incredible look at that
so the colors that I'm gonna take is I
think these two right here okay you guys
ready because I have a feeling this is
going to be really big minta because
there's a lot of my brush right now oh I
thought pink would match in perfectly
with my eyes but not like overpowering
just like a champagne e pink so these
two mixed together are absolutely
stunning you're kidding me right now
also putting this on the tip of my nose
and on my Cupid's bow down my nose but
Baba about Belle Belle the liquid
lipstick that I'm using today is from
Stila it is the stay all day liquid
lipstick in the shade at caramel oh I
picked this up yesterday I'm so excited
because I've never tried a still art
liquid lipstick so let's see how this
goes
it's a beautiful pinky nerd and I think
I'm gonna love it because when i
swatched it I was like yes well it
smells pretty good too it's not like
overpowering you're not I mean you're
kidding me
this is sort of good to apply and the
color I'm done the only thing that I
don't like about this is the applicator
is like I would say a little bit too
long I wish it was this like half the
size of what it is so then you could
like just have a lot more precision when
you are applying it but the formula is
incredible it's not like drying at all
but it is drying matte very quickly last
but not least I'm taking these
Scandinavia the makeup finishing spray I
have seen this floating around YouTube
forever mmm okay I'm gonna go fix my
hair and I'll be right back
so here we have the finished makeup look
I hope you guys love it I'm actually
obsessed with how it turned out it's
very festival appropriate if you took
off the dye Monte's I think you could
wear it on the weekend if you like to go
all out there with colors and stuff but
yeah I love it if you guys liked this
