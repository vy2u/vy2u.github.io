my channel so today I with Ronnie we're
going to be doing the two truths one
liars and basically what happens is we
have three statements and two truths and
one are lies and the other person has to
guess which one's alive yes so we have 5
groups of 2 truths 1 lie in our phones
so we're going to go ahead and jump
straight into which janitors honors yes
or what is the things we get to do or
figure out the end and Pacific's meaning
nothing but it's you can even though
you're not ok so the first one is when I
was in primary school I had a friend
named Chloe and this guy Daniel asked me
out right and I said you can only go out
with me figure out my friends at the
same time so you days to go out dated
both of us and that's fun ok so once I
was laughing so hard that I peed myself
a little in a car car from the sea yeah
I once went to an event and I had too
many vodka shots so I ended up being in
stretch up and drift in my life is that
something I would do or at you lose your
school is experiencing an attitude um
when I can't rely the day one no another
actually true in graphite in red tag and
I'm that guy who asked to date me
because you want to get first microd and
I knew I felt like oh yeah but just say
my friends as well under wise so that
actually had so many boyfriends when I
was in primary school go I never start
to themselves too scared to but those
always went to me with my bag on so that
means the lie is I did
so that's like you would through those
four we shall heat on the car seat in
the car or in my old car we go glow when
I was in school my science teacher
pulled out the chair from underneath me
when I went to sit down and I smacked my
tune on the table and bit through my
tongue okay um I got suspended from
school at least eight times plus for
being on my pony class and I went
through a stage where I was obsessed
with chalk and I even break into my
school library on weekends of get some
 I did break into school yeah that
was a bit Buffett but literally who a
child had it done
isn't that a label when you get by he
was nasty I just sit down and like as I
sat down he pulled it out for underneath
marijuana oh my god where you got sister
in the daytime yeah next one is I'm a
really heavy sleeper as you might know
and there was a fire out in the kitchen
and the alarms are going off and I
didn't wake up until mom had to come in
and like driving out that mean my cousin
used to pole dance in her room to just
McCartney on her bed near the beds that
have like the pulse on it with your high
heels in grade five and then the last
one is my name with Kennedy Jamie Lee
before they shine I'm gonna save the
file
yeah that was Jonathan really all the
live pretty much someone else yeah he
didn't wake up to Lou alarms going off
but it's actually his hangouts that
caught on fire that was right next to
him so it's really scary and I'm like so
a friend of a friend afraid of fires
what that ever happened to me I
literally died so did his mum what
happen yes I think so he falls listening
correctly okay next one
I pay my driving test within the first
two minutes because I ran a stop sign
and didn't stop I went straight through
it when I was seven my brother and I
thought it would be fun to race each
other like I go out the lives of me goes
up the stairs I'm moving Bali and I got
stuck in the lift for three hours by
myself and
the time and then I broken my arm the
same spot at least three times I ran a
stop sign before so I feel like that's
easy to do get it yes stuck in a leaf
I've done half so that's easy but
getting the arm broken that's like in
tears sort of the way yeah oh good I've
had two cats in my whole life and they
both died in first six months of having
them I once had two goldfish and I stood
on the table that the goldfish bowl was
on and the goldfish bowl fell the floor
and they like flopping on the ground oh
my god yeah and I once had a dog named
to Zara and she had puppies so we kept
one of the puppies named jacks and they
always used to have dog fights and to
Zara beat up a chunk of Jackson zero Oh
so that one's the line okay I think the
cat was true to lay the God which is my
injury so the dog thank you would I sit
on the table and I was like ah and she
wouldn't pick it up and then my brother
came with a bowl of water and put them
in and then two weeks late on my fish
were upside down like I was only
survived because on my favourite
goldfish so that was really devastating
for me and I was probably um great
thanks something so little the first
time I ever got stung by BAE I was
sitting next to a bee hive and I got at
least five times full in my body I've
been in a physical five and during the
movie Paranormal Activity I went to the
bathroom with my friend and a scary
scene came on that's a walking
downstairs got the bathroom and I pushed
her down sat in front of everyone I
don't if you're a physical but I was
worried more I said it in my like first
ever videos get what I asked um so this
girl we have like a little bit of drama
juicy drama at school and she came up
behind me and like pulled my hair to the
floor and I saw her I'm like oh my god
fan
and yeah I was my father I was very like
what are you doing like yeah he has a
cheap fellows so but she got suspended
doing it do you okay I cried at least
five times about getting hate on tumblr
because we all know how crazy tumblr can
get pretty fun that's why I turned it
off so bad one time I had really bad
anxiety so I locked myself in my room
and cry myself to sleep this is a crime
based on yeah and the last one is I
cried when Justin things I came out in
stage when I was concert when I was 13 I
feel like you would cry but Justin
Bieber
yes I don't think you'd cry the table
head yes I did I never I've never cried
over anxiety because I never get to the
point where I cry because I've always
isolate I always like get out of the
situation if i hands i yeah but my
tumblr like has these so that but it's
just cuz I was into my period so it's
really emotional that's the only time
I'd ever get upset with my period on it
and I didn't eat almost fear one morning
out again that my mom would tell me off
if I put it in the bin so I throw it
over my neighbor's fence and they can
regret yelled at me and I got grounded
for a week
um oh I see a badge okay class because I
was obsessed with the smell of them and
when my brother was little he fell out
of the tree and a stick went through the
side of his stomach and I will sharpen
oh my god I think the stick thing would
happen because that's what happen a
young anything you wait for in Japanese
how did you I suck at this yet no I
didn't so when I was in grade 9 I used
to think it was really cool to fail
subjects so I would perfectly heartless
in class and not study so I would fail
to look cool but everything for you to
like fail I know some men girls oh I was
once at a party I what really drove
and I fell in my own vomit as in I fell
biceps into my eyeball and it's not
really really good the last one is I
used to smoke a lot of parties to try
and fit in I don't think I smoked ever I
mean I've tried I feel like try to puff
yeah it was a cursing in my life yeah um
you know did that again I'm like
actually so against my guy I'd be around
Delta high school it is quite a few tins
yeah I know it's actually such a big
thing out yeah I and so I get smoking it
smells gross it's so bad but yeah I did
fail subjects because I thought it was
cool which is the biggest regret of my
life never do that always study always
be on top of things because I pass like
what great well yeah with really good
marks so real good now I feel like many
of us coming to eyes would say oh god
yeah like grade eight I got it all
straight A's and then grow nine ten I
was like oh let it go that's a fail
because everyone fail I don't know
stupid shiny okay last one ready yep

restaurant um I was an extra in the
movie Australia because it was shot a
broom in Western Australia and I used to
