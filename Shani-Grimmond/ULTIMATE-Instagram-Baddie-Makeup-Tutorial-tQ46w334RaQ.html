ah
hey guys it's shiny and welcome back to
my channel so in today's video I'm doing
the Instagram body inside makeup look so
it's pretty much just neutralized very
shimmery cheeks because highlighter is
poppin at the moment in the social media
world and then are really nice and matte
lips so obviously that's not one
specific makeup look for Instagram I
just wanted to kind of based off what a
lot of instagramers have been wearing
lately so I hope you guys enjoy this
video I'm really excited because we have
some mellow cosmetic liquid lip paints
to play around with at the end I show
you guys two different like shared so
I'm super sad about but anyways let's go
ahead and jump straight into the video
I'm going to start by priming my eyes
with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer I am in the shade light
neutral this is definitely my favorite
concealer of all time so I'm just going
to go ahead and put this all over my lid
so we can get rid of those veins on
there now I'm just going to blend that
in with a synthetic brush and this just
leaves the eyelid looking so flawless
it's like the perfect blank canvas to
work on and then of course I'm going to
step back and seal up with a bit of my
Rimmel stay matte powder so just going
to dust a little bit all over my lid so
yesterday I did film this makeup look
but I didn't really like how it turned
out so today I'm going to make sure to
stick to a makeup geek and a Nastasia
eyeshadows because I can trust these
with my whole life and yesterday I use
different friends and it was just really
hard to work with so I'm going to go in
with the makeup geek eyeshadow in a
shade at Peach Smoothie this is the
perfect transition shade so I'm going to
do a cut crease today that's why I don't
really want to experiment with other
branded eyeshadows so this one is just
coming from inner corner to outer corner
this rush is honestly incredible it is
the makeup studio s0 9 so big and fluffy
now taking the makeup geek eyeshadow in
the shade at cocoa bear on a small
pencil brush I'm just going to dip this
in set off the excess and we're going to
start making a fake crease so I'm just
going to draw a line right above my
natural crease so when we get to the end
right here I'm just going to flick it up
to my eyebrows so we can elongate the
shape of my eye the next shade I'm
taking is from Anastasio Beverly Hills
in the shade burnt orange so I'm just
going to take a big art pencil brush and
we're just going to blend out this harsh
line upwards right now I know it looks
absolutely crazy but we still have a lot
of work to do so just going to again dab
it in tap it off and then stop learning
upwards but very lightly I definitely
have not mastered the cut crease but I
still have a lot of practicing to do
there's no way we can get better without
practicing right now taking cocoa bear
again I'm just going to line directly
underneath that cut crease right there
so we can make a really sharp line just
with a little angled brush now just
taking some concealer on a small
synthetic brush I'm just going to clean
up that cut crease so just put it
directly underneath that line
the next shade that I'm taking is a
white lies by makeup geek so I'm just
going to pack this all in this blank
space right here with the zoeva 2/3 full
brush so this is just a flat shader I'm
just going to pack that down now I'm
just going to take a makeup wipe and
sharpen this line right here because I
cannot do a wing so I guess this can
just like replace that step now time for
primer I'm taking the Natasha dinner not
magic primer this one is a anti-shine
primer so it makes my foundation very
matte it smells so good it's like fruit
doesn't it fresh now for foundation I'm
taking the hourglass advantage
foundation in the shade warm beige this
is the perfect match to my fake tend
neck I love it so much I'm just going to
strokes on my face quite a few because I
want the full coverage time to blend
this in the primer makes this really
hard to blend out usually when the
hourglass foundation is on its own it
like blends that really easily this
foundation has a really really full
coverage as well I feel like this is
like the perfect shade for my fake tan
we took blended down my neck oh my god
my food tends coming off my neck you
just need my toes oh my god so patchy
that's what happens when you leave your
fake tan on for too long
now that we have a very full coverage
I'm going in with concealer again the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I can't
get away from this stuff this is the
perfect shade to highlight under my eyes
as well I've had this for so long I
don't know how it's not empty probably
nearly enough to them so just blending
this in with a damp Beauty Blender and
I'm making sure to be really careful
when I'm blending around this area
because I want to keep it really sharp
I'm also going to use this to highlight
down the center of my face that's well
this will just add more dimension to my
face so since this is really highlighted
I want to even it out a little bit next
step is to bake so I'm taking the
original
see ma no color powder it's kind of
mercy because you have to take the lid
off and then dip your Beautyblender
inside it but it is really affordable so
I'm not going to complain so I'm just
going to pack this directly under my
eyes so that concealer doesn't move
throughout the day this stuff does claim
to be no colored powder but it
definitely does leave a little bit of a
white cast but I actually like that
because I love that highlighted effect
on the eyes so while that is baking
under my eyes I'm going to go ahead and
do my brows so this is the Curtis
collection perfect brow cream in the
shade chestnut so it's just like the
under stars your dip brow pomade
consistency I'm going to go ahead and
brush my eyebrows at first and I'm just
going to make them really dramatic and
sharp and make a bit of an arch so I'm
going to start by drawing a straight
line of my eyebrows and then I like to
make a little arch right here I actually
hate doing my brows so much it takes so
long good so I'm going to draw a line
underneath my brows to define them and
then just fill them in now I'm going in
with the benefit hello flawless powder
in the shade honey this is really good
at adding extra coverage as well as
setting the foundation so that's what
I'm going to do I'm just going to do
little strokes my face because I don't
want to bother the foundation at all I
have so much peach fuzz on my face you
know a little hairy that you get around
here okay so now I'm going to go ahead
and smoke my lower lash line at with the
crease color that we use Coco bear this
is really going to proportion out the
eyeshadow look because it is quite heavy
crease we have there
and then going in with a shade at burn
orange this is the shade that we use to
blend out that crease so this is going
to go underneath the color we just put
on the lower lash line just to smoke it
out a tiny bit I really wish I could put
a liner in my lower lash line but my
eyes are so sensitive and they just
water all the time so I'm just going to
go ahead and jump straight into the scar
this is the Loreal extra black
telescopic mascara it is the best
mascara ever so I'm just going to coat
my top and bottom lashes when you first
get this product it is quite clumpy so I
feel like after you use it a few times
that's when it starts to get really good
now I'm just going to pop on some lashes
these ones are in the style sapphire
from Lily lashes I do have a coupon code
if you guys want to use that listed down
below but they are so stunning long and
fluffy and everything and Instagram
patty has I just hold onto the end of my
lashes with my tweezers and then line it
up with my lash line and always make
sure that your glue is tacky buff we've
put your lashes down it will make your
life so much easier and I just go ahead
and pinch real lash and a false lash
together a right honey booboo now it's
time to create these lower lashes
I love making my lower lashes really
long and spidery it's perfect for that
and then to finish off the eyes I'm
going to highlight my brow bone with the
Mac eye shadow in the shade on it this
is perfect for the brow bone highlight
so just taking this on a little pencil
brush and then lightly putting this
right under my eyebrow just in the arch
there just for a little bit of shimmer
because the whole eyes are very much.now
to highlight under my eyes bed I'm
taking the Taylor blue light to medium
contour kit and I'm going to mix this
shade and this one together
I just want my under eyes to be a little
bit more highlighter because I feel like
that's what's happening on the gram and
also in between my eyebrow
and on my chin as well and then to
contour my cheekbones I'm going in with
these two shades right here on a rounded
blush brush by makeup geek just putting
this directly under my cheekbones to
carve them out a bit obviously put on
the smallest amount and it just looks so
intense because my cheekbones are
naturally like really really high so I
have to remember to look down a notch
you know now I'm going in with the Mac
gold deposit and I'm going to use this
as a bronzer today I'm pretty sure it's
meant for highlighter for deeper skin
tones as you can see it's like really
shimmery but I love that bronze glow so
just go in so pretty I'm also going to
use this to bronze my hairline as well
just very lightly now time for blush I'm
taking this one by zoeva in the shade
burning up this is a a gorgeous peachy
coral shade apparently it's amazing
according to Michael so I'm gonna give
it a try it myself so I'm just gonna
start packing this on the apples of my
cheeks and then blend it back wow that
is pretty it's very pigmented so lucky
I'm using like a loosely packed brush
now it's time for highlighter so I'm
taking the anastasia beverly hills moon
child glow kit i've been seeing a lot on
social media people living for their
iridescent highlighters so that's what
i'm gonna do today
i'm going to take this shade Lucky
Clover right here i feel like the other
ones are too pink or too purple for this
makeup look since it is really neutral I
want to keep it quite a neutral on the
choose as well let's do this
remember why this side never goes on
that's dramatic I'm also going to put
this on the tip of my nose as well
um can you blend out please Thank You
gel also on my Cupid's bow I'm just
going to spray a bit of the NYX jewelry
finishing spray I've never used this
before I swear to God if this ruins my
makeup and group cry wait testing the
spritz off piece of dog I definitely
would not recommend that setting spray
literally has just sprayed chunks of
product out of my face and then when I
go to blend the me in takes my
foundation off now it's time for the fun
part no lips so these are the mellow
matte liquid lip paints I have all the
shades here and I think the most
instagrammy ah the instagramming colors
in here are these two right here so I'm
going to try these on for you the first
one I'm gonna try on is I'm gonna leave
the name of the description because I
honestly don't know how to say this
shame guy this shade is a really nice
warm tone like nudie brownie I don't
really know how this guy but it is
stunning let's do this hmm oh that feels
so good I feel like these liquid
lipsticks are very comparable to the
ultra liquid lipstick formula they're
very mercy and hydrating it is still
really nourishing on the lips that's all
you need to apply
so this is what shank guy looks like on
I think it matches really nicely with
the cut crease the color in there
because it is really warm tone and then
the lip is warm tone but I definitely
want to show you guys this color right
here I think this would have to be my
favorite color out of the collection
this one is called Terran so this one's
more of a purpley mah be nude so here we
have the finished makeup look if you
guys are interested in getting anything
from mellow cosmetics and make sure to
use the code at shinee sha and i in
capital letters to get 10% off storewide
I'm completely obsessed with them and I
can't wait to try out all of the other
colors because there's so many if you
guys like this video please give it a
big thumbs up and love you so much and
I'll see you very soon bye
