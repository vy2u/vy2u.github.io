today's video I'm doing a inspired
makeup look by the beautiful Laura she
plays a role in Star Trek beyond the
movie that is coming out July the 21st
and I'm so excited her makeup looked
amazing so I had to recreate it so let's
jump into it let's start with a super
clean and moisturized face so we can
jump straight into the eyeshadow so I'm
taking a primer for the eyes this will
also cancel out the discoloration on
there as well as you can see I have a
lot of veins so I just want a clear
canvas for the eyeshadow a horror
signature makeup look was really simple
yet really easy to create so anyone can
do this it was like a winged liner
neutralized and really highlighted face
so with the eyes I'm going to start with
a medium cool turned brown and this is
going to be the transition shade so
we're gonna take this from inner corner
to outer corner on a really fat fluffy
brush you can really just use that Brown
and it can just blend up nicely with
whatever's left on the brush we can
sweep that over the lid but I really do
want to keep that quite fair of course
we're gonna go ahead and clean up that
eye shadow that we um do a bit of over
blending with
now I'm gonna take some black eyeliner
so we're gonna create a wing today I'm
just gonna take a little angled liner
brush and I'm just gonna you know do the
best wing I possibly can I've never
really been that good at wing so I'm
just trying my best as long as you just
take your time
you will get it eventually so just doing
like kind of a small wing nothing too
dramatic now going in with a white eye
shadow I'm gonna put this under the
eyebrow ahora had a really intense
highlight under the brows so that's what
I'm gonna do and then of course I'm
gonna go ahead and blend it out so
there's no harsh lines now I'm going to
take some it's strobing cream because we
want the face to be extremely glowy and
luminous so just rubbing this all over
my face it feels so incredibly
moisturizing as well I love it now it's
time for foundation so I'm gonna even
out my skin tone I'm just applying this
foundation with a flat top brush and it
just applies so seamlessly so I'm just
gonna create like a medium coverage
for concealer I'm taking a shade that is
about two shades lighter than my skin
tone to really highlight on the eyes and
to cancel out the discoloration because
girl ahora did not have purple bags
under her eyes like I do
so just blending that out with my
stippling brush works magical wonders
editor I'm also going to go ahead and
put that lighter shade of concealer in
the middle of my eyebrows on my chin and
down my nose just to add a bit more
dimension to the face now we're gonna do
a little bit of baking so I'm just gonna
take a sponge and pack this under my
eyes just because I didn't want any of
that concealer to budge at all while
that's baking under my eyes for a few
minutes I'm gonna go ahead and set the
rest of my face so all the products we
put over the top blend out really
seamlessly and I can't help but notice
that little dot of foundation that is
non-existent on my nose like I can see
all my little freckles like Hello now
it's time for the brows so I'm just
gonna take a shade that is the same
color as my natural brows and we're
gonna go ahead and fill any sparse areas
in I'm also gonna create a little bit of
an arch just so we can have the same
brows as the horror and then we're done
with those caterpillars now with
whatever is left on that liner brush I'm
just going to go ahead and take that
from the outer corner to the middle of
my lower lash line just to add a little
bit of definition now it's time to prep
our lashes for falsies so I'm gonna go
ahead and run some mascara through my
top and bottom lashes I really like to
wiggle my mascara from side to side to
get me every single crevices of every
lash so with a lower lash line I tried
to keep it very minimal as that's what
horah had but I always got irritable
with my lower lash mascara especially
with this mascara because it's so good
yeah honey it's time for the fun part
I'm gonna take some false lashes it's
time for a dance let's do this so I'm
just gonna pop these on these ones are
like a cat eye effect which I love so
incredibly much these have a really thin
vent as well so they go on just like
that yeah now it's time to contour sir
I'm taking a sculpting powder and I'm
just gonna put this directly under my
cheekbones to really cheers little Abbe
there's bones girlfriend we're gonna
make it really intense now it's time for
bronzer so ahora had a beautiful
beautiful glow to the face so I'm just
gonna go ahead and pretty much put this
everywhere honey so under my cheekbones
around the forehead and also on my
jawline this is just gonna add a lot of
life back into the face a lot of like oh
I actually went outside and got some Sun
you know now it's time to start with the
glow which is one of the most important
things of this makeup look so I'm gonna
take a kind of shimmery blush and I'm
just gonna put this on the apples of the
cheeks and blend it back it's gonna add
a really nice natural flush of color as
well which is so amazing then of course
I'm gonna go in with highlighter sorry
I'm gonna spray my brush to make sure
it's nice and damp so the highlighter is
intense
this one is incredible because a Horace
highlight wasn't like shimmery it was
just really glowy and natural and just
oh I don't even know how to describe it
with so void show just putting this on
top of my cheekbones and pretty much all
over my face like go in with that
highlighter go
now I'm gonna spray my face with some
fix+ because I really want that glow to
shine through so once that's dry I'm
gonna go ahead and put some more mascara
on my lashes just because I wanted them
to be a tad more dramatic and I love
love the way they look now taking a lip
pencil that is a few shades darker than
my lips I'm just gonna go ahead and
outline them a little bit just to define
them then I'm just gonna go ahead and
fill them in very lightly I still want
my lips to look quite natural so I'm not
going to heavy-handed with the step to
finish off the look I'm taking a bit of
lip gloss I'm just gonna put this all
over my lips for a nice sheen and I love
this product so much guys like woah so
that we have the Ahura inspired makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it I
love how it turned out I can't wait to
go see Star Trek beyond it comes out on
July the 21st so I hope you guys have an
amazing day I love you so much and I'll
see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
