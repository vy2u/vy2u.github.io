channel today I'm doing the ultimate
bronze makeup tutorial so I hope you
guys enjoy the first thing that I'm
doing is starting off with my eyebrows
this is the Mac true brunette fluidline
I love this for the brows it's really
Lucy and it just makes it so easy to
really shape the brows so I'm just
making an arch and making them super
long and just defining them a little bit
the trick for really defined and sharp
brows is taking a thick concealer on a
small definer brush and just drawing a
line straight underneath those brows to
really clean it up and to make them look
really sharp I would definitely
recommend this step then of course just
priming my eyelids with that same
concealer this will get rid of any veins
and it'll make sure the eyeshadows
really pop on top then of course going
in with a pressed powder just over the
top of that primer so everything is set
down in place now we can move on to the
eyeshadow so the first shade I'm taking
is Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm
using my old favourite eye shadows this
one is going directly in the crease so
we can start off the transition so all
the other colors blend into this one
really easily so I'm taking a big fluffy
brush from Mac this is my favorite one
ever I'll list it down below because you
guys need to try it the next shade I'm
taking is frappe and this one is going
in the crease as well the exact same
place as I place the other one except
this is just going to make it a bit
darker and I'm just starting from light
and then making my way to darker so the
colors just blend easier now I'm just
picking up an even darker Brown and this
one is going directly in the socket so
I'm using a really small fluffy brush
and just working it from outer corner to
inner corner so they can have a more
definition in there and of course I
always go back in with my blending brush
to make sure there are no harsh lines at
all so as I said before we're starting
from a ladder to darker shade so now
we're onto the darker shade this one is
a red earth by Anastasia Beverly Hills I
just went in that socket a little bit
more to darken it just a touch
now it's time for the lid color so I'm
going in with this beautiful shade by
makeup geek and I'm really just going to
pack this all the way over the lid so I
started off by using fix+
and a brush and then I went in with my
finger to make sure it looked really
foiled and chunky it is such a beautiful
color now for the face I'm going in with
the Nivea
who shave balm because this day I was
going to a festival so I needed my
makeup to sound whatever and let me tell
you my makeup didn't budge at all so now
it's time for foundation I'm taking a
really full-coverage foundation the
makeup forever one and I'm just going to
buff this into my skin with a really fat
kabuki brush this is the easiest way to
apply thick foundations and it just
looks so beautiful and airbrushed I love
this it was a little bit too orange for
my skin but later on I made it work with
bronzer and concealer and all that good
stuff but I'm just going to take a small
paddle brush to go around my brows
because since I did fill them in at the
start I don't want to get any foundation
in there and I want to be nice and crisp
still and then for concealer I'm going
in with the Kat Von D lock-it concealer
this one is really light I didn't
actually notice how light it was but I
guess we learned through that
highlighted look today I'm just putting
this under my eyes and also just in the
center of my face to really brighten it
up a bit and just going in with a Beauty
Blender to blend it all out this is a
really nice concealer I think I just
need to get something that is a little
bit dark hard to match my fake tan I did
have to go in with a big kabuki brush
and blend it out with a bit of
foundation just because it was like
stark
anyways to set that down I'm going in
with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and just packing this directly
under my eyes so we have no creasing and
then for the rest of the face I'm just
taking my Australis of fresh and
flawless powder and I just pack this on
with a dense brush the reason why I use
this powder is because it is a little
bit darker than the foundation that I
was using so I kind of wanted to change
the undertones of it make it a bit more
Brown than orange which was like kind of
what the foundation shade was doing and
it worked really well and on top of that
this powder adds a little bit of extra
coverage as well
now I'm just going in with the Taylor
blue light to medium contour kit and
picking up shade number two which is a
banana shade and I'm using this to brush
away all of that translucent powder and
then at the same time I'm going to
highlight a little bit now taking the
shade at frappe again this one's going
from the outer corner to the inner
corner so I took this on a fluffy pencil
brush I wanted it to be nice and some
mochi then going in with a red earth by
Anastasia Beverly Hills I just focused
this on the outer corner of my lower
lash line just to really bring the eye
look together and even it out a bit now
for the highlighter I'm taking this one
from Mac and I'm just going to highlight
my brow bone with a really dense pencil
brush and this honestly looks stunning
when you hit the light it just shines so
bright then for mascara I'm going in
with this covergirl the super sizer just
coating my top and bottom lashes so we
can prep them for falsies
now I'm just taking this white eyeliner
from Stila and just lining my waterline
to make my eyes appear a bit bigger then
for falsies I'm going in with these are
massive ones from Lille lashes they are
so stunning and fluffy so I'm just
popping these on it really close to my
lash line and then pinching them
together now it's time to contour it so
I'm taking shade number five and just
putting this directly under my
cheekbones to make them really define so
I'm just using a tiny little angled
brush and going in honey going in now it
is time to go in with bronzer so this
one is from Mac it's a new one that I
just recently picked up but because I
have the worst memory in the world I
don't know what it's called but I will
leave it down below so I'm just gonna
bronze up my face with a massive brush
just going on my cheekbones and also
around my forehead and under my jawline
this is such a pretty bronzer I'm trying
to find something to replace Mac give me
Sun but like this one's not quite there
but it still is amazing now of course
just going in and baking to clean up
that bronzer that went down a little bit
too far just going to let that bake
while I do my blush now I'm taking this
brush from makeup geek these blushes are
so pigmented I'm just putting this on
the apples and blending it back then
it's time to a wipe off the Bakke oh my
god I picked up this new highlighter
from Mac and it is honestly so what's
stunning this was the first time using
it and I was alone out of the water such
a pretty color it's really different to
all the other highlighters that I have
which is saying a lot because I honestly
have so many highlighters make sure you
give this video a thumbs up if you do
want to see a makeup collection though
because I just cleaned out on my drawers
and it's looking stunning at the moment
okay so let's move on to the lips I'm
taking this lip liner by essence it is
such a pretty shade it's like the
perfect nudey pink and of course I'm
gonna over draw my lips just a tiny bit
then for the lipstick I'm taking this
one at from its Tila this was the first
time you're using it it was really
drying on the lips and it took like a
few swipes to actually get the color
payoff that I wanted but I always like
to try different products I like the
color of it but I would say the formula
is
the best but it still is pretty good
lastly I'm going in with the decay of
long lasting at makeup setting spray
putting on about 20 pumps on my face and
then we are done so I really hope you
