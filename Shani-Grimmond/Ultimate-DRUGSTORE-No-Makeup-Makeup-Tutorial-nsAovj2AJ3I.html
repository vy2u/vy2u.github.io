my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a no makeup makeup look using only
drugstore products and I'm going to try
and limit the brushes that I'm using as
well so it's just really mineral
products and just super easy to recreate
so I hope you guys like this video give
it a big thumbs up and let's jump
straight into it the first thing I'm
doing is taking my simple kind of skin a
rich moisturizing lotion I would
recommend moisturizing your face no
matter how much makeup or how little
makeup you are applying and as a matter
if you have oily skin moisturizer is a
must this one's great it's super cheap
and it works so well I've been using it
for years this is just going to make the
products that we put over the top go on
a lot smoother and you want to make sure
that you put moisturizer under your eyes
as well because you don't that concealer
bunching up to all the dry patches under
there for primer I'm taking the NYX the
angel avail primer so I'm just going to
put a little pea-sized on the back of my
hand
and work it into my skin this is a
really thick consistency so it feels so
nice rubbing it onto my skin it's like a
mousse to even out the skin tone I'm
taking my chichi super CC cream this one
is in the shade medium toot and this has
like a really I would say it has a
really decent coverage but it still
looks super natural on the face and it
feels really light I love the color as
well it's super neutral it matches
really well to my fake tan so the brush
that I'm using is the Real Techniques
buffing brush this is from Priceline so
let's do this
see how freakin full coverage this is
I'm gonna really buff it into my skin
make it look super natural oh my god
this match is so well to my neck girl
the more we blend it out the more
natural it's going to look
I guess the purpose of this video is to
make it look like we have very natural
minimal makeup if you guys want to
literally just look like you have no
makeup I'd probably just recommend doing
a very very light sheer application of
tinted moisturizer and then a touch of
mascara or just curly lashes otherwise
it is kind of obvious that you're
wearing makeup but we're going to keep
it very natural today now for concealer
I'm taking the Maybelline fit me in the
shade 10 so I haven't used this
concealable school but I've heard that
it is absolutely amazing so as you can
see my face is looking very plain like
just one color so I want to give myself
a natural highlight on to my eyes but
nothing too dramatic so let's do this
you're probably thinking at nothing too
dramatic what I'm going to blend this in
with the Real Techniques sponge this is
so good for blending out concealer I do
much prefer be blenders and I'm pretty
sure they're only like five dollars more
expensive than these sponges right here
the B lenders just apply foundation a
lot smoother this one makes my
foundation a bit patchy but for
concealer it is amazing I'm also you're
going to put this over my eyelids as
well just to cancel out any
discoloration on there to set under the
eyes I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte
powder so this powder is amazing I've
hit pan on it I'm very sad about that
but I really like to bake under my eyes
whether it's like when we want to have
fluff on my nose whether it's a really
natural look or really dramatic just
because it makes it concealer under the
eyes and not budge at all
so to bake I'm just going to get a
little powder up so I'm just going to
scrape up some powder you're probably
thinking what the hell but I put this in
a hacks video and it worked really well
so it should look something like this
I'm just going to take a bit on my
Beauty Blender and Pat this under my
eyes where the concealer is this is
really gonna stay put all day let me
tell you honey then taking a little bit
more of that powder I'm going to use it
to set the rest of my face just super
lightly because we still want a little
bit of glow to come through
and I'm just going to dust this fake
away to tidy up the brows a little bit
I'm taking the Maybelline a master brow
Pro palette I'm just going to pick up
this shade right here and just put a
tiny bit in my brows to add a bit more
color back into them
and whatever is left on my brush I'm
just going to take this through the
front of my brow really lightly now it's
time to curl my lashes so when we put
the mascara on they'll be nice and curly
and long this is the first makeup
tutorial that I've done in the longest
time without putting on false lashes
it's like the weirdest feeling so for
mascara I'm going to take the Maybelline
the falsies push-up drama it's so
confusing because it's like what's I
done twist the right side I'm just going
to wiggle this side to side in my lashes
just to add a little bit of volume and
length I always like to focus most of
the mascara on the outer half of my
lashes to make kind of like a cat eye
eyelash effect I'm just going to add a
really light coat to my bottom lashes oh
my god is honestly adds so much length
for the cheeks I'm going to take this a
Maybelline fit me blush in the shade
light rose and the brush that I'm using
is a Revlon contour brush this one is
pretty good they're kind of expensive
though so this one has a lot of shimmers
throughout it so it's going to act as a
highlighter as well this one's just
going to add a nice wash of color to the
cheeks really really really natural this
would have to be one of the most natural
blushes I've ever seen in my life
just for a touch of warmth I'm going to
take the Maybelline Dream Sun bronzing
powder in the shade 0-3 bronze so this
is going to go around the forehead very
very lightly
and also a little tiny bit under the
cheekbones you can't even tell that the
bronze is on my face you just want to
keep a really really light hand with
this product for the lips I'm just going
to make them look a little bit more
defined with the NYX retractable lip
liner in the shade natural oh my god oh
my god it literally just fell out okay
so I'm going to take the NYX retractable
lip pencil in the shade nude instead
this honestly is such an amazing shade
it really just makes my lips look more
juicy so on the lips I'm going to take
the Maybelline Baby Lips in the shade
candy wow peach so I'm just going to dab
this on it really lightly because it is
very pigmented so it has a lip gloss and
a lip tint in one it's really good my
lips are dry at the moment and lastly
I'm just going to blot my lips so it's
not too shiny or color isn't too intense
so that we have the finished makeup look
I hope you guys enjoyed it you can
definitely see a little bit of makeup
still but it is super natural and
honestly takes five minutes if that
so that's what I'm talking about honey
if you like this video please give it a
big thumbs up and I will speak to you
very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
