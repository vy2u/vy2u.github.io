example a light you went quiet and we're
like looking at the elephants and I was
like when I look at an elephant I
imagine it stopping you but it speaks
okay guys sorry what we are just about
to head off to dinner I think it's like
a to close something we literally just
had like right now no actually at 7:00
at 7:00 okay seeing senator but um yeah
I'm gonna head down to do now and this D
not is actually lack set up in the pool
I'm so excited is like amazing
um but I am wearing a dress so I'm not
too sure like it was very so we're not
gonna have to my bikini shortly about
wow there's not vomiting it but this
colors sorry
yeah I'm wearing these like platforms
I've never once she's like this with one
city good location
we went down to have a dinner I'd like
everything was a little good and then I
just got really really bad anxiety like
I want to vomit like it's never been
this bad in my life I'm just like dark
feel like myself right now
like I've been served with this whole
trip you guys aren't here I have a
really bad social anxiety like I'd be
really good this whole trip like talking
everyone like it's being fine and runs a
sword ice and then it was time to like
go around the table and be like what's
your favorite favorite thing you've done
on trip and like I don't know what it is
but like when I sit down with a group of
people it can literally be my best
friend's like I would literally be with
five of my best friends and I'm living
playing like a group game and I will
literally like go to garlic I literally
am in a moment I don't know what it is
so I was like I said to like the ladies
at work for glasses I was like oh my god
I cannot stay right now as much as I
want to like
and it's like I'm gonna vomit like my
anxiety has literally never been this
bad and then I like it's not a crime I
can't control it like as much just like
I want to stay and prove myself I'm just
sorry scared I don't know what I'm
scared of
by talking in front of other people
literally I think when I get hurt I'm
gonna talk to a therapist about it I
don't know what I'm gonna have to do to
kind of like I don't know what they'll
make me to get her for I'm assuming they
gonna make me push through the anxiety
and like stay in situations like what I
just escaped out of like because as soon
as like I feel uncomfortable that comes
through sorry I can't stay
okay physically like my brain is like
it's weird like my brain like switches
off and it's like how do you know what
I'm saying right now because I'm sorry
that's it
but one of the ladies that works for
glasses was she has anxiety as well and
she made me feel so much better and
obviously golf I want to because how I
feel is more important and whatever is
going on out there
it's sort of weird there because like I
can go so I can meet up and there's
literally like five hundred of you guys
there and I'm like fine like you can
meet all of you and talk to all of you
like one-on-one but it's as soon as like
I'm put on the spot to talk I get the
worst anxiety and I cannot in my mind I
can't push through it but I know I'm
gonna have to eventually it's actually
the worst feeling in the sir now
that I'm back in my room and I'm
assuming I'll start to feel a little bit
better soon because I'd be like I just
try not to think about it but yeah I
think I'm just gonna watch Netflix or
something to try and relax myself but I
think I'm gonna end the book here and
then oh look I'll probably look tomorrow
I'll keep you guys updated sorry I think
people won't even look I love you guys
so much
sorry I feel like this sad and being
like the no hype are an exotic ending
because literally like an hour ago I was
so crazy and hyper and like being
running which Lee likes seeing at the
front of the boss like it's or wait how
I can just be like completely fine lad
and Jenkins were out there to lack sir
not it's weird but I'm sure some of you
guys don't understand if you have
anxiety as well
whatever make sure you give this fear
unless it sounds out on a say a massive
thank you to classes as well for being
so nice from this trip and everyone just
being like really chill and just so
lovely and like it's crazy because every
time I go on a trip with a brand I'm
always blown away from how genuinely
nice these people are like it's crazy
sir thank you so much blessings full
taking me on this trip this is honestly
being like one of the best trips I've
ever been on like it's just means I get
to meet so many people and see this
beautiful place and have a view like I
do like I'm just so lucky to come to
places like this with such amazing
influential what people it's just I love
it so much
I'm sore sore lucky which is why I feel
so bad for like leaving dinner but I
hadn't nary that I have to do it like I
tried my best to be polite and stay as
long as I could but then I go to the
point where I'm like I'm about to cry
well I didn't stop crying but I walked
away so you know what so hey I guess
I'll speak to you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
