my channel or welcome to my channel if
you're new so in today's video I'm doing
a makeup tutorial on it this look right
here it is inspired by Valentine's Day
but obviously you can wear at any time
of the year lots of pinks and it's just
really girly and sparkly and fun so I
hope you guys like this video and let's
go ahead and get started I had a fresh
10 on my neck that's why we have that
color difference so starting with my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot as per usual just
using this to prime my eyes it is the
only one that I use it's amazing so just
putting this all with my eyelids to make
sure we have a nice clean base and also
to hide the veins and to make the
eyeshadow very intense and of course
just putting a powder over the top to
make sure it's not tacky now taking my
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade
I'm using this as the transition shade
it's a really nice dusty pinky purple so
perfect as a crease color I'm just
taking this from inner to outer corner
on a big fat brush just making sure I
diffuse it and it's nice and soft and
now taking a blending brush that is
really tightly packed I'm gonna use this
to blend out any harsh lines at that
transition shade might've caused and
then I'm taking the shade it's simply
Marlena this is gonna go directly in the
crease so it's not gonna be as blown out
as the transition shade so when I first
applied this I was like oh my god is it
gonna look like I have pink eye but it
actually looks really pretty and the
formula of this eyeshadow it was crazy
good could you imagine if there was no
such thing as editing you would
literally be sitting here watching me
Belynda my eyeshadow for so friggin long
so now just cleaning up those edges with
a q-tip to make sure it's nice and sharp
and putting that same eyeshadow all over
my lid until it's super super intense
now taking my anastacio Beverly Hills
self-made palette I'm picking up the
shade at pink champagne and just popping
this in the center of my eyelid to add
some dimension to the eye shadow look
otherwise I'll just be super boring and
plain it is time for the face so I'm
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
primer in radiance and just putting this
all over my face
it leaves the most beautiful glow it's
amazing now taking the covergirl outlast
stay fabulous 3 in 1 foundation in the
shade 8 5 or 7 I'm just applying this
with a Beauty Blender I honestly just
can't to use anything else but a Beauty
Blender at the moment it just leaves the
most full amazing flawless coverage and
brushes tend to leave streaks on my face
so pull my hair back and making sure it
blends into my hairline I don't know
about you guys but watching someone
apply a foundation when they have a
white face and tan body it just it's so
satisfying to me so now for concealer
I'm taking my Mac Pro Longwear and I'm
just using this to highlight and you
can't slap discoloration so under my
eyes and down the center of my face and
it cools use my Beauty Blender I'm
making sure to really concealer under my
eyes just because I do have pink
eyeshadow once or if you don't conceal
it's gonna look like you probably do
have pinkeye and infected eye so make
sure you do this step girl now with my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
I'm just gonna set under my eyes and all
over my face basically I'm using a wedge
and it's honestly works so incredibly
well if you guys are looking for a good
baking powder you need this okay so I
did my eyebrows and I hate them so let's
just get past that after about 5 or 10
minutes you want to go ahead and brush
off all of that excess powder I've
literally had so much excess powder it
was like getting in my eyeballs
everywhere
I'm also going to use that translucent
powder to set the rest of my face it
just makes bronzer and blush and
highlight going so much easier and it
just blends like a dream then taking
that same at crease color I'm going to
take this on the lower lash line so from
inner corner to add a corner to bring
the look kind of together to make it
proportioned and then I'm going to take
a darker purple and just blend out with
a fatter like little pencil brush taking
the shade buttery I'm using this to
highlight under my eyebrows every time I
look at my eyebrows I want to cry they
are tragic they'll collect slugs but I'm
getting them done on Wednesday and
getting them tattooed and reshaped so
I'm really excited for that for mascara
I'm taking the benefit roller lash and
just coating my top and bottom lashes
now I'm lining my waterline with the
taught in a rim liner this is the
perfect shade to make the eyes look more
awake and just nothing bright and the
formula is so nice it just sticks to
that water line so just applying some
thoughts lashes I love really long wispy
lashes I'm not sure what they're called
because I'll just like lying around a
room but they are so pretty I love them
to contour the face I'm taking the
anastasi out contour kit and these two
shades and I'm taking a little chisel
brush from makeup geek and it makes
contouring it's so much easier love it
I also thought I'd take the same shades
and contour my nose I'm not too sure if
it made a difference but it was fun I
love trying new things now taking my
makeup geek blush in the shade
spellbound it's a really nice light pink
so this is going on the apples of my
cheeks and then I'm blending it back
this and I talked about make a pick all
the time and how amazing that products
are and I need to like chill out a bit
this isn't sponsored by makeup geek I'm
just obsessed I'm afraid I know now
taking that translucent powder again I'm
just going to use this to really carve
out my cheekbones
I wanted the contour to look nice and
sharp and neat and this is a really
really good job you guys should
definitely go get some wedges you could
probably get them some like came up for
like three bucks or something so cheap
now taking my Anastasio Beverly Hills
highlighter in it so Hollywood I'm
spritzing my brush with mac's fix+
and plopping that on my cheekbones it's
like heaven how amazing and intense is
that it literally just pulls the holes
together by the way this brush I'm using
it's the highlighter brush from
anastasia and makes highlighting so easy
and just like it applies so much product
I'm also applying a little dot of that
highlighter on my nose to make a look
cute and small and also on my face as
well because I want it to look more Joey
and I didn't want to look too matte and
that's what the translucent powder does
do so just dusting off that translucent
powder and we can move on to the lips
for the lip liner I'm taking the
colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade at
Lumiere and just outlining my lips and
just defining them a little bit and for
the liquid lipstick I don't know how to
pronounce it I'm gonna try and I'm gonna
butch it it is
Mirian see mmm it is the mattifying lip
Rouge and this is in the shade to Rome
it is stunning
sorry that concludes this video guys I
hope you enjoyed it I love how the
makeup turned out and yeah if you did
