so we're going to go to the spa now
because that's not just with my hair
hey guys it is now day two of my Vanuatu
trip and the first leg two to three days
and be really boring that's why I
haven't vlogged much I can't wait to get
on to the actual island so I can start
vlogging but yeah it is now nearly nine
o'clock at night and we had full night
so I'm just wearing this well pretty
dress and the ship keeps ship the ship
keeps a rocking and Court has
seasickness and I had some tablets but
then it's not going away it's really not
going away I don't feel well my burps
are going to turn to vomit soon guess
what we are in New Caledonia it'll be
excited hey guys we are in New Caledonia
yeah and it's really boring we're just
walking around you gotta go to the beach
now even though it's really bad weather
hey poodle what are we doing now we're
waiting to get back home waiting to get
back onto our perch because we are bored
the water cost me $4 hi guys we are in
Lefou and we're walking up the mountain
to have a nice look at the view
it's actually really huge I'm running
out of breath
we made it the walk was worth it
okay so we're going down to the black
hole it's just a black hole of water and
you jump right in
you can't see okay we made it into the
cave and it's really dark and scary and
now we're going to go find the hole to
jump into okay oh it's like a friggin
jungle bridge Holy Bull safcord is a
rope to hold on to my back all right
down up we go this is so awesome we made
it into the cave Wow dark
was that fun okay we did it now we're
going back up this is what we have to do
all the way out there yes hey honeybees
is now a day four of my cruise and today
is the day where we go to Vanuatu so the
first stop is going to be Turtle Bay and
then we're heading to Blue Lagoon and is
so excited so yeah I think I'm gonna go
get ready now that look like an absolute
turd
hey oh no I just like to do videos yeah
so we are in Vanuatu now and we're at
the Blue Lagoon
we just went to Turtle Bay and it was so
nice oh my gosh I'm just loving Vanuatu
I will show you the blue lagoon right
now hey now this is what we call heaven
on a saucy Sean sundel backflip again no
we have to go the best of Richter's Sean
okay attempt two of Sean doing a
backflip
yeah I'm home now so I'm home now I have
been home for two weeks I actually
couldn't um like vlog when I got home or
even in the last like few days because I
got a chest infection and a really bad
flu and yeah too excited I'm finally
better so that's awesome um I don't
really know what do I even say right now
so basically I can evaluate the crews
and tell you guys what I thought um
besides the seasickness it was really
really fun I enjoyed it but I probably
wouldn't go on another cruise again only
because the seasickness was so bad and I
mean you don't really get that much time
on the actual island because so so much
of the time you're actually travel
you're actually travelling to the
islands um I kind of excluded myself
from what everyone else was doing
because I kind of suck at making friends
and everyone else that I was with was
like hanging out with people that you
know they met on the cruise and I'm the
kind of person that will exclude myself
if I don't feel comfortable so that's
kind of what I did and that's another
reason why I didn't have a very fun time
at the end of the holiday like the last
few days but other than that it was a
really fun time I'm glad I glad I went
oh but yeah the bottom line is I am home
now and I have never been so happy to be
home in my own bed I can actually
starfish on my bed because I had a
single one on the cruise and yeah I had
a fun time but there was a few rough
patches here and there ah I will see you
guys very soon I hope you enjoyed this
vlog if you did enjoy it make sure to
give it a big thumbs up because you guys
know how much that means to me and yeah
I will see you very soon well guess what
the mage just left us snazzy
