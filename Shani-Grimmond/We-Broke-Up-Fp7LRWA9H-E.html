so if you guys don't know Jonathan and I
broke up about two weeks ago now and I
just wanted to kind of explain to you
what's happened obviously I don't have
to give you guys any explanation at all
I just feel like I want to I love to
tell you guys things about my personal
life
and obviously Jonathan was start
shipping part of my life in Manila and
my social media and everything so I kind
of want to tell you what's been going on
because I have been m.i.a a little bit
obviously breakups are so hard and I do
think a few of you guys can learn from
this as well because I'm sure this
happens all the time I mean in the same
situation has happened to me two times
now so henna Park heavy
I feel really different like I honestly
feel so weird because when change
happens in my life I freaked out I
literally freaked out I love having a
routine and just being very comfortable
I don't like to be out of my comfort
zone and that's definitely what's
happening right now
being on my own I've literally had a
boyfriend since I was like 15 I had one
for two and a half years and then
Jonathan and I were dating for two and a
half years and basically what happened
was I fell out of love and it's so hard
to say because like the last thing that
I want to do is hurt John today oh
I mean I had to like put myself first
and it's to having people but I
had for myself first the last thing that
I wanted to do was hurt Jonathan but as
I said I think at the end of the day
your happiness is what's most important
so I decided to tell him that I didn't
really see like you know a future like
getting married and having kids and
stuff with him I just didn't feel like
it would work right for each other like
I didn't like he was right for me so I
made a step to break it off with him and
it was really hot I guess he used to
know when you're going to be with
someone forever and I knew I was in the
case so I thought it was better to drink
now and like later on like I was so
happy he literally made me feel amazing
like he
I feel radder coffee this morning up
like all over the place and on my
period but he made me feel like so happy
so confident like a he made me feel like
the most beautiful girl in the world but
I don't know that was just something
there that didn't like I don't know I
didn't I don't want to be mean just like
 love it but I just feel like I
felt like I didn't really have that
connection anymore with him and I tried
to fix it I tried to do everything I
could but I just knew it wasn't MIT
today now that I'm like on my own like
jonathon smoothing out he's getting like
an apartment or something I don't really
know like we're still talking and stuff
but obviously I'm not going to like ask
her if me shouldn't tell like that but
like yeah he's moving out next week I
think and we had a massive like
like for our conversation the other day
about everything like about like
everything we've done for each other and
how we both made each other into a
better people and like all of that and
it was really hard and bawling
my eyes out which one hyperventilating
it's hard like breakups suck
sorry bad and it's so hard to like get
the words out that you want to say and
to me that was like the hardest part and
obviously seeing how hurt he was and I
know that one day he's going to find a
girl that's just going to be so obsessed
with him and is going to love him so
much and just treat him like how it
should be treated because he's like the
most perfect guy ever honestly like
that's crazy I guess you can't help how
you feel so that's great initially my
first feeling when we broke up was I
just felt so much hurt in my heart and
mostly I just felt really bad and I feel
so bad but I know that this is the right
thing to do but I also felt like I just
I could made the right decision like I
noticed throughout decision and I know
that this is like what I want my wasn't
sure so that's why I thought I would
tell everyone because I know that like
there's not going to change but I'm just
really happy that me and Jonathan are on
like really good terms like we're
texting right now
he's still my manager he's still like
represents being with like luck and
everything so I'm glad I still like
having my life on that that side of
things but yeah he's still going to be
like seeing my family stuff cuz I got
really close bindi bindi and peanut
since I Wayne oscillators with mom at
the moment but I asked him like if he
wants to see bin and he like you can see
them whenever he wants obviously because
in Anjaana so close like I said I said
you know I'm like he gonna come snooping
it's actually made me cry so much I was
like he gonna come to you thing and I
just started crying my eyes out because
there's like the disgust with each other
and that was like one of the main
questions you guys were asking like
what's happening with being a P like I
mean I don't really know like what I'm
even saying right now just like letting
let's fly out of I'm outside if you guys
are in a position where you don't feel
like happy or you feel like you're
wasting the time or like you're not
getting treated well like just do what
you need to do like put yourself first
for once be selfish for once I've talked
about this before and it makes me so
emotional when I talk about it but um
before before I met Jonathan I was
seeing like guys like how'd you doing
Mike when you in high school like what
do you like schooling like you see guys
and they treated me so bad and I
literally thought to myself like I'm
never going to find someone that treats
me like how I should be treated is like
that's why I like I held onto Johnson so
long but he treated me so well and like
just like no one's ever going to treat
me like this well again thank you guys
for sure there are guys out there that
treat you like how you should be treated
and you should have put up with um guys
that treat me like or girls
whatever it may be and I think like the
most important thing when you go through
a breakup is to make sure that you have
friends and family to support you
because that's honestly what's made this
all like process of me I started to
 mad
that's what made this whole process with
me so I went easier than when it could
have been like I could just imagine if I
was alone throughout this breakup I
would have been a mess like I
would have honestly been a wreck and
having like Michael and like rowdy and
like mom like everyone support me even
though like I'm the one and I don't like
I said anything wrong but even though
I'm the reason why we broke up it's
still nice to like have their support
and have them understand me and
obviously like understand both sides of
a great cop you can't distract yourself
from heartbreak you can't make yourself
be happy but honestly the only thing
that's really going to make you happier
I feel better again it's just time like
just take time to you know find yourself
find who you want to be in life well I
guess that's pretty much everything
that's pretty much like the bottom line
of the story and if you can grab
anything out of this video as I said
 Ferguson myself it don't swear
it's much of Meeks that's disgusting and
tacky but I just can't help it I have so
many emotions going around my head right
now I'm sad but I'm happy I'm so happy
like I really am like I don't want any
of you guys to leave any pity comments
down below like I'm honestly fine like
even though I'm crying I'm just like I'm
just letting it out and I don't want
anyone to be like pity like I really
don't want to obviously like I'm sort of
fine I'm so happy okay so thanks so much
for watching I hope you guys can
understand please don't send Jonathan
any hate obviously we won't you know
what's happened now he's not the bad guy
he's never done anything wrong in this
relationship
I just wanted to kind of put that out
there so you could get understands like
what's happened hopefully no one's
 asked me what happens when I go
out because it's the last thing I want I
don't want people to say are you okay I
don't want people to say how's John I
don't know I like I don't want to hear
about it because I'm trying to move on
I'm trying to be happy
mine and Jordans relationship from now
on is between him and I I love you guys
so much bottom of my heart I honestly
wouldn't be where I am without you guys
today and that's why I'm so happy right
now like you guys have made literally my
dreams come true and I would never take
this job for granted would you even
cooler job probably not just let me you
guys in on my life it's showing you how
to do makeup
showing you guys clothes and everything
