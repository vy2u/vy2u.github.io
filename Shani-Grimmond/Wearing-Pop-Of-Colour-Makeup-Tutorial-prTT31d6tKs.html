my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a makeup swirl on it this look that I'm
wearing right now I just wanted to play
around with some colors so I have like
kind of a blue Caprice
I have not perfected cut creases in the
slightest I have a lot of practice to do
but yeah I was just playing around and
thought I would film it and I'm wearing
a really good seenu's pink lip which I
love but usually I don't use the glosses
because my hair gets Gordon about the
fakeness fear I think it looks really
pretty
alright you guys like this video and
let's go ahead and get started first I'm
taking my Mac prep and Prime at 24 hour
extend eye base and I'm just gonna use
this to prime my eyes it has a really
nice velvety feel to it
very nice so just setting that with some
powder to make sure the eyeshadow blends
that nice and seamlessly so for the
eyeshadow I'm taking the MAC eyeshadow
in the shade
and just using this as my transition
shade from inner corner to outer corner
just in luck windshield wiper motions
now taking my morphe eyeshadow palette
I'm gonna pick up a medium cool turn
brown and run this directly in my crease
kind of just to create a cut crease and
i'm using a tightly packed pencil brush
i have the worst i shape for cut creases
but i'm trying to work with what I've
got
so once I've done that I'm gonna blend
it out a little bit just to make it a
little bit more diffused
and of course my favorite part of the
eyeshadow I'm gonna clean up that line
with a q-tip and just making it really
sharp and defined and then for the star
of the show I'm taking this makeup geek
foiled eyeshadow it is so beautiful it's
like an ocean blue so sparkly and so
pigmented the only problem I had with
this is it transferred above my lid
because I have eye
anyways taking a little bit of a darker
shade than what we originally put on in
the crease I'm just gonna digging it up
a little bit and blend it out now taking
my Nivea man sensitive person a balm I'm
using this as a primer all over my face
so just rubbing it in until it gets
super tacky I've never really had too
much luck with primers I'm still testing
this out to see if it actually does work
so now taking my ex1 invisi wear liquid
foundation I'm just blending this out
all over my face with a Beauty Blender
they have a lot of really nice colors in
their range to match like yellow
undertones and it also has a really nice
like luminous finish to it as well and I
don't know what it is but I always go
back to using a Beauty Blender with
pretty much every foundation I own it
just does such an amazing job at making
a flawless really luminous finish
because you do have to wet it so it
gives that glow from the water oh I just
love it so much
now taking my NYX HD you can see a lot
I'm going to use this to conceal out any
purpley kind of colors and also to
highlight on my face so taking this
under my eyes and also down the center
of my face what a surprise I'm using my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
under my eyes this isn't so amazing just
to bake under the eyes and make it nice
and highlighted so just doing that with
my Beauty Blender this just comes in
handy so incredibly much so after I left
that on with my face for about five
minutes I dust it off and it looks so
beautiful for my eyebrows I'm taking my
essence eyebrows stylus set and I'm
using the darkest shade to fill in my
eyebrows so I have had my eyebrows
tattooed on so I know you're like what
shape to follow and stuff but there has
been a little bit of ink fall out so I
need to go get them refilled again but
I'm just making them bit darker since
I'm wearing like dramatic eye shadow and
dramatic lashes and all that so now
taking my balm I shall repeal it and
pick up a white shade I'm using this to
highlight right under my eyebrows
now taking that medium-brown increase
call that we use I'm gonna put this on
my lower lash line so I'm putting it on
the outer half and also the inner half
and I'm gonna leave the middle free with
this shade right here so I'm just gonna
pop that right in the center to add some
drama to the eyes so for mascara I'm
taking the benefit they're real mascara
this stuff is in credible I always go
back to this stuff so just putting a
crap-ton on my top and bottom lashes now
taking the balm black eyeliner I'm gonna
line at my lash line just so when I put
the falsies on top you can't see like
the lash band or anything like that I
suck so bad at eyeliner even if it's
just like a simple black line oh good
anyway it's just popping on some falsies
is the ardell lashes oh my god I'm
realistic style down below they are
incredible I have to go get like a
hundred now taking my Laura Mercier
powder again Oh things get a bit messy
here so this makes my cheek products
blend out so nicely on top so I never
skip this step for contouring i'm taking
the NYC smooth skin bronzing powder this
is a beautiful shade to contour so I'm
using my nas eita brush which is a new
purchase and I'm completely obsessed
with it it makes contouring so easy I
love it full bronzer I'm taking my
hourglass or radiant bronze light
bronzer this is so incredibly beautiful
it's so luminous and so rosy so I'm just
putting this on my cheekbones and also
around my forehead to look a bit more
sunkissed
now taking up my makeup geek blush I'm
just gonna put this on the apples of my
cheeks and blend it back this is the
shade that will match nearly every
single makeup look I always always lean
towards this color now for highlight I'm
taking the mary lou manizer by the balm
i haven't used this in the longest time
and i have just fallen in love with it
again so just putting that right on top
of my cheekbones and also a little bit
down the center of my face and on my
forehead to make it look a bit more dewy
time for the lips so I'm taking my
toothpaste a lip pencil this is such a
good formula it's just so easy to apply
it it just blends on like a dream so I
did want to keep it nude today because
the eyes are quite intense and I
couldn't really think of any other color
that would match so I think nude is just
the perfect option for any like dramatic
eye shadow that it's colored now for my
ride-or-die lipstick it is the MAC honey
love it matches absolutely everything
I'm just gonna put this bowl over my
lips it is like a really mattes
a nudey pink formula it is stunning
and then lastly I'm taking my YSL
lipgloss this is stunning I'm just
popping this all over my lips to add
that really nice glossy finish and I
feel like I'm gonna be using this a lot
so there we have the finished look I
hope you guys loved it I just love
playing around with different colors and
seeing what I can come up with so yeah
if you guys like this video please give
it a big thumbs up and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
