so most mornings usually look something
a little like this and ya know it's a
little bit of G for the morning but if
we can we have a lot to do today most of
the time I wear a little crop and pants
to bed so I thought to save you guys
from seeing that I would check on a
little dressing gown this one is so
comfortable because it's silk
love it and then I'm just opening up the
curtains to let that light in first
thing I do in the morning is play music
I love you just set the vibe on a really
happy note with some loud music I just
listen to whatever is trending on
Spotify
now it's time to check my little diary
I'm trying my best to stay organized
this year that is definitely one of my
new year's resolutions so just spending
like a minute or two writing in my diary
and seeing what I have on that week and
then of course checking my Instagram and
snapchat and all of that good stuff I
will have all of my usernames linked
down below if you guys want to keep up
with me on there
it's finally time for breakfast so today
I'm having some Turkish bread with
poached eggs and avocado on top I am a
sucker for bread but it makes me really
tired so I try and limit it as much as I
can so maybe once every few weekends
it's it's fine to have
and now it's time to eat this beautiful
masterpiece that I made holy crap I've
never tasted anything so YUM so usually
I spend his time to catch up on some
YouTube videos this one went for like 30
minutes and I watch the whole thing so
proud of myself and then I found bindi
on the table god I trained her well now
it's time to freshen up a little bit and
start my morning skincare routine so the
first thing I'm doing is taking a gentle
everyday cleanser and just rubbing this
into my face for about 15 seconds I like
to do it for a while just to get rid of
all of those impurities and dirt and
sweat and all that gross stuff
now just brushing my little pegs and yes
I know I have a really weight obsession
with my dog I can't help it so just
moisturizing my face I can't start the
day without moisturizing my face
otherwise it feels really stiff so this
is definitely a must in my skincare
routine
if there's anything that I hate doing it
is moisturizing but it's definitely
something that I have to make myself do
because my legs are naturally super dry
and I fake tan so it just cracks really
easily so making sure to do this every
day my ten stays nice and dark so
depending on what I want to do on the
weekend
sometimes I'll head to the gym and do a
nice workout I only recently just
started back up at the gym I'm so unfit
so I'm basically doing about 15 minutes
on the treadmill of running and some
fast walking and then I'll do some other
little exercises but I'm working myself
up to getting fit again I used to be fit
but look at me now
another thing I like to do on the
weekends is to eat surprise surprise and
just to relax and watch movies and TV
series and stuff Jonathan and I could
literally just do this for days on end
if you guys haven't seen it the TV
series called suits you have to see it
it is so good while being dishes eating
grapes she's so cute oh we're pretty
cute too
and then other days of course I like to
go shopping or to the movies or just
select do fun things go to lunch and
stuff like that so just applying some
foundation all over my face and then
some concealer under my eyes to really
wake me up and then I like to set that
with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder this stuff is so good so yeah
just really quickly speeding through my
makeup if you guys do want to see at my
everyday makeup routine I will have it
linked down below and I should really do
an updated one as well
but yeah now I'm heading out the door
and getting on with my day so it's time
for lunch I thought I'd grab some things
to be healthy I hope you guys like this
morning routine if you did please please
give it a big thumbs up because it
helped me out so so incredibly much and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
