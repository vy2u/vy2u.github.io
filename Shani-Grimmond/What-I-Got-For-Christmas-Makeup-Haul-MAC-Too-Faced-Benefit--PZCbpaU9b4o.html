videos in one I'm doing what I got for
Christmas and a makeup haul of what I
recently just purchased so I'm really
excited to do this video because one I
love Christmas and two a love new makeup
and before we get started I just want to
ask you guys what you think of this
lipstick because I'm new to dark kind of
lipstick so let me know what you guys
think in the comments below and let's
get started okay so first of all let's
talk about what I got for Christmas and
in no way shape or form am i bragging
you guys have just requested this fear
so I thought I'd go ahead and do it and
I'm so grateful of everything that I
bought of everything that I received so
yes let's just jump into that the first
thing that my mom bought me is a iMac
and I think it's like the 25 inch the
smallest iMac you can get and it was
like 1,600 and I paid 600 of it in my
pay a thousand so i was so grateful of
that and I'm in love with it it's so
easy to edit with on that computer so as
you can see it's just so beautiful and I
just love it so much so if you guys are
looking for a new computer that is
definitely the one to go for my brother
has a MacBook Pro the laptops and I was
going to get one of them but then I
thought nah maybe if I got one of these
desktops then maybe I won't be on the
computer as much because I'm like
sitting up and I'm not laying in bed
like I would be on the laptop but no
I've been on the computer so much
but anyways moving on I also got this
beach towel it's just like a really big
beach towel and I need one of them so I
love it and another thing that I got are
these base bud classics and they're just
some really good headphones I got the
color pink and they have little dye
Monte's at the end of the you know
little thing there and they're really
good I haven't really used them too much
but I'll let you guys know what I think
of these and apparently they're really
expensive though whoa I'm really excited
to try them on Zout and I also got three
pair of cute Nikki's and these are from
I so you can get three pairs for $12 or
something so yeah I just got black white
and blue I don't really want to talk
about them good hour it's weird I also
got this beyonce pulse perfume and i
never smelt it before I've got it and it
smells amazing I don't know how to
describe the smell of it but I don't
know it sounds really good and I also
have the Beyonce heat one in the red
bottle and that's amazing I'm so upset
you guys just miss my test ooh it just
cut out as I had one anyway I also got
this Rihanna perfume and I don't know
what it's called but I'll have that link
down below and it's just the one with a
black and gold around it but this is
like my favorite perfume I've ever smelt
I don't really I don't know how to
describe it but the only way I could
describe it is that it's really sexy
without sounding cheesy from my friend
Alana I got these two things here it is
the fantasy hidden perfume and the
lotion that comes with it and I love
Britney Spears perfumes every single one
that I've smelled is so amazing and I
don't even know she had this color
bottle fragrance or whatever but it
smells like really really good and I'm
actually pretty picky with my perfume so
I'm very impressed by Britney Spears and
last but not least my boyfriend got me a
two hundred dollar gift card for Maya
and I love getting gift cards because
you can just go out and buy whatever you
want and you know you're going to love
it
so yes I'm very happy about this one and
I just love gift cards and another thing
that he got me is the lovely perfume by
Sarah Jessica Parker and this is my
second favorite perfume oh my god I'm so
thankful he got me this because it
smells so so good I think it smells
really elegant and I don't know I don't
know how to describe it once again but
it just smells so amazing so right now
let's move on to the makeup haul oh my
god I just realized the whole time I was
filming that I had like red lipstick all
over my teeth so don't mind that I did
realize but let's just get started into
the hall and the first thing that I
bought is the mary lou manizer by the
balm the highlighter and it is so
beautiful is the most pigmented
highlighter I've ever tried is amazing
and I've only used it once but safe to
say it's really good and it's so much
better than the Mac mineralize
skinfinish in soft and gentle because
look I hate that highlighter it's just
not
five and another thing that I bought is
laguna mars bronzer and holy balls this
stuff is really good it has a little bit
of shimmer in it
nothing overpowering you can definitely
contour with it still contour can
definitely contour with it still and
yeah I just really like it so far and
I'll keep you guys updated on what I
think and another thing that I bought is
this Too Faced natural eye shadow
palette and it comes with six shimmery
shades and three match shades it's all
the colors you would ever need
I think this palette is just so amazing
all the colors are phenomenal I haven't
really used it too much of any used at
once and that's the eyeshadow that I
have on today and I use push-up and six
breasts so I think they're really sexy
names so yeah I'll keep you guys updated
what I think of this but so far it is
thumbs up really good then I went to Mac
and I bought some of the most popular
products that they sell just so I know
that they're good and I bought the Mel
bar blush and it's just the powder blush
I think it's really pretty it's just
like a dusty rosy kind of pink and it is
so pigmented when I tried it it was like
a massive red strip up here because I
didn't think I'd be so pigmented anyways
I really like this so far and I also got
lady danger the Mac matte lipstick and
it's just like a fluorescent red I was
going to get um Ruby woo Andry whoo whoo
really tongue twisters yeah they just
looked really dark on my lips utter
nerds and she didn't really sue me and
the ladies like since you're tan you
probably should try this one because I
don't know it's really pretty so yes I
like this one a lot so far and I also
got this tan pigment in tan it's just as
gorgeous gorgeous shimmery shade it
looks like this and I'll be doing some
tutorials using this Thrun it's just
like the most gorgeous color ever I'm
just so excited to try this one out I
also got the Mac prep and prime that's
really a tongue twister when you say it
100 times anyways it's really good so
far obviously I can't like tell you guys
if it lasts if it makes your makeup last
longer obviously I will tell you guys
soon and it's the skin based visor so it
has a little bit of shimmer throughout
it but when you put your foundation over
the top it comes the shimmer and I'm
really thankful about that because I
hate like sheer all of your face
oh wow my stomach's very hungry and I
also went to benefit and I bought the
high-beam benefit illuminizer whatever
it's called it's just a highlighter in
this kind of like nail polish looking
bottle it's so amazing I'm oh my god I'm
obsessed with this alright areas are
like three times but honestly you guys
you have to get this it is phenomenal
another thing that I bought is the
benefit gimme brow tinted brow gel and
it comes with like a little spooley on
the end and I got the darkest shade just
because my eyebrows are pretty dark and
I have like dark features and stuff like
that but I'm really impressed with this
so far if you're in a rush you can just
put this in your browser it looks like
you've filled them in and everything so
I really like this but I still like to
extend my brows a little bit with brow
pencil and then put this over the top
and it just looks amazing so while I was
at my Carmex email I got some samples
and I got these two little Clooney
examples so I'm really excited to try
these because I have one of these so
long so hopefully they're as good as
what everyone says I also got the tool
kit cute baby face I'm doing makeup
remover wipes and I've used so many of
them already I don't really like them as
much as the viral ones but they're doing
pretty well so far and last but not
least I got the Cape Somerville exfoli
Kate
little exfoliating this is obviously the
sample and I used it last night I really
like stung my face but it worked so well
it's just like this green substance
I don't know it works really well so I'm
gonna keep trying it and then see how
that goes see if it stops my pimples
again because it did last night so let's
see how that goes and I'll probably go
buy the full size and it came in this
bag by Clinique
Enya is pretty ugly but whatevs and
there's two more things that I got and
it's this little cute chain it's just
like a really pretty butterfly and I got
this from the jewelry shop as well as a
new belly bar it's just a 9 karat gold
love heart belly bar with a short little
bar because the long bar obviously
doesn't fit that's rambling shut up
Shani testy you guys heard it and
there's one more thing that I want to
talk about it's just like my background
and like how everything's changed I
don't even know if you guys have
realized but I
and uploading as much lately because I
have recently moved out to the country
and it's really different but I'm going
to get used to it obviously because I'm
living here now my parents split up so
I'm moving oh I'm with my mom now and my
siblings so that's fine my parents are
