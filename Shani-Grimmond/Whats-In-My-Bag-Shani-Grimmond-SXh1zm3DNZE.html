in today's video I'm doing a what's in
my bag so usually I don't carry a bag
around because I think it's really
annoying and I just don't like carrying
things or I usually do is carry my
wallet because I wanna use my card and
my license but recently I thought it'd
be a good idea to just get a bag a good
quality one that I'm going to have for a
really long time and just put everything
in it that's kind of essential so I have
filled my bag with things that I think
are necessary let's get straight into it
okay so let's start with the actual bag
itself I have the Michael Kors it's
Selma black satchel leather bag I just
wanted something that was really basic
something that wasn't too big and I
could still fit a fair few things in
there so this is just like a black
leather one with a gold logo and it has
one little zipper right here so you have
the part where everything goes in
obviously and then you have a zipper on
the side and then a few pockets to put
random things in sir I just think it's
perfect the size and the quality is
amazing and I feel like I'm going to
have this for a very long time
oh it also comes with this strap so you
can put it over your shoulder as well
but I kind of prefer to put it over this
part right here just because I think it
looks better but I will get sick of that
so I probably will be using this Paris
as I said I do not like having things
alright so the first thing that I have
in this bag is my wallet of course I
take this everywhere I go so in the back
of it I have my pill that I take because
I'm on the contraceptive pill for my
pimples I use Brenda by the way and I
hope it starts to work soon cuz my
pimples haven't really gone anywhere but
I put that in the back of my wallet just
because I need to take it every night
and it's always with me and I also have
a hair tie in the back as well because
you never know when you need a hair tie
okay so in the first compartment I just
have my cards and my coins I never carry
cash with me because if I have cash on
me I will spend it like that okay so
next I have some makeup in my bag
usually I don't take makeup when I go
out but I just thought it was kind of
good idea because I get really bad laugh
lines right here and then sometimes
maybe like right now I get a little bit
oily so I can just touch up so this is
the Urban Decay Naked skin
ultra definition foundation powder so
this isn't a shade medium and then I
have this little stippling brush right
here because it's kind of like a
multi-purpose brushing you just
basically do whatever you want with it
and this also has a mirror in it as well
so I thought that'd come in handy I also
have a little perfume here I do need to
get another travel sized perfume because
this is Justin Ben one and I've had it
for like five years if you guys know of
any good perfumes let me know in the
comments below because I am a sucker for
perfumes I love them I also have a lip
balm this is the bloom brush cosmetics
lip balm right here my lips get dry all
the time because it's getting really
cold here and then the last makeup
product I have is the NYX butter gloss
in the shade tiramisu most of the time
when I go out I have a nude or a pink
lip so if that fades off I'll just tuck
this over the top and it'll look good as
new
this is amazing lip gloss and it is so
affordable I just love it oh my god and
it smells oh boy sorry good so the next
compartment right here I have my gum so
I have my juicy fruit oh my god this gum
tastes absolutely moving and I also have
some gum to keep my brush my breath
smelling fresh it's just the extras and
I hate the smell of minty things I
honestly hate it it makes me feel so
sick but obviously it's the thing that
can keep your breath smell fresh so I'm
just going to have to deal with it and
then right next to that compartment I
have some hair ties and bobby pins and I
also have my phone in this pocket it
fits nice and perfectly nice and
snuggles so it's just my phone it's 215
million
so I better get this video up pretty
soon okay so in this last is the key
compartment right here I have things
that I kind of want to hide because I
just don't want them floating around in
my bag because they look ugly or I just
probably wrote using all the time so the
first thing that I have is some hand
sanitizer in case I get food on my hands
or like my hands get sticky or they
stink something you never really know I
just thought that would be handy I feel
like a big thing that about everything I
have this in my bag because I feel like
this would be handy though why else
would I have it next thing we have are
some makeup remover wipes I was looking
online like what should you have in your
handbag it said you should have makeup
wipes or whack any kind of wipes in case
you get messy something out okay no but
I've got them in there and it doesn't
really take up much weight like so it's
sort like it's going to add any more
weight into my bag also have some pads
and where's my to importance over there
to tampons one pad because I always keep
my period unexpectedly it's really
annoying
anyway I have the Aveeno daily
moisturizer lotion sometimes my skin
starts to feel really dry to the point
where it reaches so I just thought this
would be good because it's in a little
travel sized bottle and I feel like I
could use it a few times and whatever
also have some makeup remover wipes got
long sotell oh my god no more band-aids
headphones they're definitely staying in
my bag forever because you never know
when you want to block out the world and
listen to some freaking good ass music
but yeah that is everything that I have
in my bag if you guys have any other
ideas of things I can put in here not
that I really need to put anything else
in here because how did you impact if
you ask me just let me know in the
comments below so I freaking love this
bag it's so beautiful and I would
definitely recommend it to any of you
guys that need a good quality bag that's
gonna last well over a year it has
little legs on it like little feet to
complete down anyway so I'm going to
stop talking now I hope you guys enjoyed

thumbs up if you enjoyed it and don't
