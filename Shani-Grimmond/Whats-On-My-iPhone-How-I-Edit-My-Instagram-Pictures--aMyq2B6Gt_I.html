so today we'll be doing the what's on my
iPhone tag and I don't know why this is
so requested I hate watching the iPhone
tag videos I feel like they're so boring
but I'm going to try and make this as
interesting as I can so you guys can see
everything that's on my phone and I'll
be showing you how I edit my Instagram
photos and a few other things like that
so let's just get started okay so the
first app right at the top which is
pants down there your app that I go on
the most and that is Instagram so I've
got like how many people my following
I'm falling like 194 people and I have
68 posts so I always go back and delete
old photos because I feel like why did I
ever post that photo and I get kind of
embarrassed about old photos that I post
so I delete them so yeah I just keep
everyone updated on what I'm doing I
post like um photos of my new video if I
you like posting video that day I'd be
like yo check this out and then I like
post selfies and photos of my dog and my
boyfriend of my friends and everything
like that so it's basically just my
personal laughs on Instagram it's
nothing really beauty related I don't
really want to make a beauty related
Instagram because I feel like I have
Instagram because I feel like I have
YouTube it's opposed to my beauty
related things so yeah that's that so
the next app that I have on my phone is
Facebook and I hardly ever use Facebook
I feel like it's just so boring and
Facebook has died so what can you do I
post on there like every few days maybe
like I post many photos so you guys can
follow me on there if you want but
nothing really interesting on there then
I have tumblr up here and I absolutely
love Tumblr I've had it for like four
years and I'll have the link down to my
tumblr down below but I'm always on it I
seriously like at least check it every
hour so yeah I have 90,000 followers and
I'm absolutely absolutely
in love with every single one of them
because I feel like tumblr is the place
where you can like be yourself out of
all the social media sites you can be
yourself the most and people won't
really judge you so that's really good
and yeah I just love all my followers on
there that's so lovely and supporting
the next step that I have in my phone is
YouTube and I don't really go on YouTube
too much on my phone
because I go on my computer um because
it's much easier so yeah I have YouTube
and then I've got Safari down there and
I don't really use Safari much either
because again I use my computer and then
I have followers plus so this is kind of
like behind the scenes of Instagram so
you can see who's I'm following you see
how many likes you got like average on
each photo your fame value and your
followers and blah blah all that stuff
so I really like using that app and then
I have a mail which comes with every
iPhone but I know I really like um
having mail like at the start of my
collection thing because I always get
messages and I like to reply straight
away so yeah I now have clock and
settings on there because everyone has
it and I have App Store and my Optus
just to see if I'm going over my plan
because sometimes I tend to use too much
data but yeah that's about all for my
Optus app and then I have contacts which
is boring and I have eBay don't really
use that too much because you get like
you have to pay a fee to sell things
which is ridiculous and when I sell
things they never sell so I can't give
up on you go and I also have music
nothing really special in there my
favorite song recently is Iggy Iggy
Azalea Iggy Azalea I don't know how to
pronounce her name but she is so hot I
love her music and then I have maps
because I'm so Bible directions I have
no idea around my home town like I have
no idea where to go so if that comes in
handy and I have calendar and I have
countdown and if you guys don't know
what countdown is you have to download
it it's called captain light because I
think this is the free one so you just
type in like what day and what time
you're going to be going somewhere
special and then it has a little
countdown for you so there's 107 days 10
hours and 59 minutes until I'm going to
bed a while to it and I was so excited
and that has like my schoolies countdown
which is 219 days that's so long and
then I've got my 18th which is in 338
days so long the next step that I have
is actually a folder it's a folder of
photography so this is how I edit my
Instagram photos so the first one that I
have in there is this vsco cam this
Oh cam so this is basically an app that
you can use to edit the filters on your
photos so I think that they have really
nice filters and stuff so if you just
click on your photo that you want to
edit you can just go along to all of the
different filters and my favorite one is
m3 I think it's amazing I use that all
the time and then um t1 is also nice so
yeah I really like this um editing app I
think it's really good it has all my
favourite filters on there because I
feel like Instagram has really gross
filters now I feel like I've just used
them too many times I'm over them next
we have white to Graham and I use this
all the time this is how you fit your
photos into your Instagram because you
know when you go on Instagram and it
kind of like cuts off half the photo you
like oh I wanted the whole photo in
there so you just click that little red
button choose existing and then you just
like get a photo and then you can see
the actual whole thing so I think that
comes in handy I use this all the time
if you go on my Instagram you'll see
that I've used white a gram on there
like every every second photo something
I just love that little app the next one
is insta college and photo colleges are
both like milli the exact same so you
just open it and then you can like put
the little collages like a photo next to
each other okay so then I have another
little folder right here and it just has
everything that comes on your iPhone and
also has my emoji key I just feel like I
don't want to leave it out on my home
page so I put it away in a little folder
and then I have notes and all of that
boring stuff and I also have another
photo College down here which should
actually be in photography so excuse me
while I move that and then I have Shazam
and snapchat yet Shazam is where you
just um like you're listening to a music
I'm sure everyone knows this you're
listening to a song you're like oh I
like a song and one who sings it and you
just Shazam it you click tap to listen
and then she then finds it and then you
can download it okay so yes and snapchat
my snapchat is Shia grooming but I don't
really use it because I feel like the
camera on there just like makes
everything with disgusting the camera is
just really bad quality and then another
one that I have is tapped out which is
just the Simpsons app and this is like
the only childish app that I have in my
phone
but when I get bored I feel like I want
to play something so yeah I just have a
little Simpsons and then down the bottom
I have messages because obviously I use
that a lot and then I have camera
because I'm always taking photos of
something to put on my Instagram because
I'm always using Instagram and I have
photos so I've got 142 photos because I
put most of them on my computer so I
don't like having lots of photos on my
phone for some reason OCD I don't know
okay so now I'm going to be showing you
all the iframe cases that I have and as
I said before I have an iPhone 5s so you
just type that into eBay it'll come up
with all these cheap cases they're like
$2 $1 so that's why I always in my
iPhone cases because I'm not going to go
pay 2000 s for an iPhone case when you
can get one for $2 a bit of a popper
sometimes a gift so the first one is
just this pink clear case a bit dirty
well and then I have this purple one
it's just a cheap like plastic one but I
feel like it looks pretty good and then
I have a clear one just so you can see
like the gold on the back of my phone
because I got gold so you can see it not
so you can hide it and then I have these
two pink ones and again these are like
the hard cases so they don't only
protect your phone at all but I'm
working on getting some more cases that
actually protect my phone so when I had
an iPhone 4s I got so many cases off
eBay and off like in this shopping
center and stuff so the first ones that
I got from eBay the first three that I
got are these ones here and again these
were like three dollars so if you guys
want new cases eBay is the place so yeah
I have these and these are the rubber
ones so I think they're really
protective and very nice and I also have
this little one here which is so sad
that this doesn't actually fit my phone
anymore because I think it's so pretty
it has all these rhinestones on there
and a little Tigers face but I was
thinking I could just um do a giveaway
on my channel and give away like these
two nice iframe cases
well not the cheap plastic ones because
that's a bit cover what I'll be giving
away like the nice ones that I haven't
actually used because I never got around
to using this because it's like really
heavy and I don't know I just feel like
it doesn't really protect your phone but
it is super pretty so I will give it
away if you guys want me to so just give
this video
up if you would be interested in that
another one I'd be giving away is this
$80 iPhone case it looks like this it is
so so so so so so pretty I love it so
that is all for my iPhone cases I have a
weird obsession with buying them and I
have no idea why I just feel like
they're so cute with all the little
rhinestones on there so I really need to
stock up on some pretty iPhone cases for
my 5s because of the different shape and
stuff so yeah if you do want me to give
away some of these open cases then just
like this video and I'll be sure to get
that done because I really want to do a
giveaway um so yeah I think that's all
so if you have any requests on some
videos that you want to see just leave
it in the comments below and I'll be
sure to get that done and yeah I'll see
you on the next video bye loofa that's
what it's called so you can use either
one or you can use like a gel that has
all exfoliating beads and all you do is
you put your hand in it and you just rub
it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
