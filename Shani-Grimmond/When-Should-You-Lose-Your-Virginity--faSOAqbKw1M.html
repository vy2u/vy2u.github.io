my channel so in today's video I'm going
to be talking about the topic of sex so
a lot of people have asked me to do a
video about this topic for such a long
time and know it is a very personal and
touchy subject that's why I was kind of
holding off for so long but I'm finally
here doing it for you guys for those who
have been asking sorry if you don't want
to hear about sex or losing your
virginity or anything like that then
feel free to click off this video and I
will have a makeup tutorial on this look
very soon so the main reason as to why I
wanted to make this video is because
every single day and I'm serious
every day I get hundreds of messages in
my tumblr asked box saying 'shauni I
haven't kissed a boy and I'm 17 or shiny
I'm 18 I've never had sex or hey I'm 13
I've never held hands with a boy what is
wrong with me what is wrong with me so
I'm aware that it's becoming far more
common to have sex at younger ages in
today's society and that's purely just a
fact I don't know why it's happening but
it is but I'm just telling you that just
because your friend is or your cousin is
or the popular girl at school is having
sex does not mean that you have to it's
something that you shouldn't feel like
you have to do to fit in with other
people it is definitely just a very
personal decision and something that
should happen naturally and comfortably
and when you're just a hundred 100
percent ready no one should ever tell
you when the right or wrong time is to
have sex because at the end of the day
it all comes down to you and what you
want so sex means different things to
different people and that's completely
fine because each to their own some
people it means a lot to it's really
special and for others maybe it doesn't
mean as much to them maybe they don't
care about it all maybe it's just for
pleasure or fun or whatever and that's
completely fine
but I'm just telling you to do what you
think is right and what makes you happy
if you want to have sex then go ahead
and if you don't then do it so if you're
with someone that wants to have sex and
you're not ready all you have to do is
tell them just be straight up and honest
because
the end of the day a relationship is
more than just sex so if that person
that really had the best intentions for
you and cared about you then they would
wait until you're 100% ready and 100%
comfortable and that's that so if you
feel pressured into having sex with
someone because you think they'll stay
with you or because you think they'll
like you more definitely think twice
because a relationship is more than just
sex you and more than just sex healthy
relationship does not revolve around
that so don't feel like you're in a race
with other people it is not a
competition it is not something that you
have to get done it is purely just
something that's going to happen
naturally when the time is right and it
should not be forced because that's
probably when things get a little bit
awkward and uncomfortable I definitely
think it's important to stay true to
yourself and your choices because at the
end of the day things that you do with
other people are going to affect how you
feel so I would take for you guys to
feel disgusted in yourself or have any
type of any like feeling of regret
inside of you or anything that you're
not proud of because I know how it feels
to have that regret inside of you it's
not a good feeling and it's not
something that you should feel so
hopefully you stay true to yourself
girlfriend so now a little bit about my
experience of losing my virginity I had
a boyfriend that I was saving for two
years that I had sex with um I was quite
young and it's not something that I
regret but it is probably something that
I wish I waited a little bit longer for
that makes sense but I think the most
important thing is I was ready and it
was with someone that I loved and
someone that I truly cared about so I
think that's definitely what's most
important so I get a lot of questions on
tumblr the typical questions is awkward
does it hurt do you bleed and all that
the very very nitty-gritty personal
questions so for me it wasn't awkward
because it was with someone that I
trusted a lot and I definitely think
that's important to make sure that you
trust people because you would I would
hope to be able to go and say bad things
about me after having sex or spreading
rumors because we all know that can
happen sometimes and it's horrible so
you wanna make sure that you trust them
then hopefully it's not awkward I mean
sometimes it might be that's ok I guess
sometimes it happens in life but as far
as like does it hurt I mean it shouldn't
hurt because things you should have done
things previous to having sex to make it
not hurt you I'm saying but that's kind
of awkward to talk about it on YouTube
so yeah that's pretty much all that I
wanted to say for this video I'm sure
you guys have got the message as to what
I was trying to say this whole time just
wait till you're ready so true to
yourself don't feel like you have to do
it to fit in because you honestly do not
do not have to have sex to fit in with
anyone I promise you and yet just stay
true to yourself I hope you guys like
this kind of video um I'm kind of scared
to put this up because hello we're
talking about penises and vaginas and I
don't know if that's appropriate but I
mean a lot of people have asked for it
so anyways I hope you guys like this
video and I will see you very very soon
bye sorry I'm just popping this on the
back of my cheeks and then blending it
forwards and if you are using a Mac
blush I feel like dance and dance and
whatnot movin then I just sit back and
decipher what they really meant
hi lied how long will I meet you last
