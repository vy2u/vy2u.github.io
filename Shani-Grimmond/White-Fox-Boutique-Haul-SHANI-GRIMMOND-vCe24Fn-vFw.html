hey guys it's Johnny and welcome back to
my channel so in today's video I'm doing
a clothing haul I haven't done one of
these in the longest time so I'm
honestly so excited this is pretty much
the first shot that I've done to get
ready for summer so all of my summer
clothes and I am obsessed with them all
so I've teamed up with white box
boutique to bring you this video today
and I also have a 15% off discount code
for you guys if you want to do through
that you can save some money so the
discount code is 15 SHINee and that will
allow you to have some dosh off until
the 31st of December I have Sony's and I
have some makeup products and then like
a literally a big pile of clothes just
right here so let's go ahead and get
started
oh I'm going to start with some studies
because I'm obsessed with it I need to
talk about them right now so these are
the key sunglasses in a cat eye shape
with some silver detailing up here it is
matte black and honestly these my
favorite Sunny's I've ever had these are
going to be definitely like my staple
some losses that I wear all the time
so apparently it's pronounced as key and
it probably is but I just want to call
it way because I've been calling it that
ever since I got my first pair of Quays
sunglasses this is what the next pair
looks like I love these ones a shave
them are really unique I don't have
anything any like shapes like this in my
sunglass collection and yes I do have a
lot of sunglasses because I'm afraid and
love to wear them as accessories I don't
even really wear them in the Sun I don't
know but these ones are really cute they
have like a little leopard print and
they're kind of like a circular shape
and I just think that's so cute the next
ones we have are so amazing these are
also like a leopard print as well and
these are the kitty one so very cat eye
or I've been honestly one of these for
longest time I love how they have the
really thick band here and these are
also key kWe whatever you want to call
it alright so then we have the last two
I think these ones are like staple to
whitefox boutique because everyone that
has these are from this so we have the
purple reflectin and then like the
mirrored silver I personally don't think
these suit me but Jonathan insists that
I keep them so I know what do you guys
think do you like them I think he's like
really cute especially Fleck the beats
and stuff because they have the
reflected but I'm just not really a huge
fan of the shape of them I think they
were just like I don't know maybe I just
don't suit my head but these ones oh my
god
a little okay so let's dive into the
clothes so this is the first thing that
I got it is a nude crop it zips up at
the back it's literally a perfect fit
I think it's so sophisticated and pretty
because it has this like strap here and
then you also have like the sassiness
with the v cut down here it makes the
young cleavage looks so nice I'm a size
8 as well in everything if you guys are
wondering this is like perfect for
clubbing as well I just love it
I think it's pretty versatile because
you can wear it just as like a casual
top with like high-waisted pants or you
can wear it clubbing so I think that's
amazing
okay so next we have like the same style
but in like a bag yaar more casual
version so this is what it looks like
the material is a bit thinner and is a
bit more comfy because it's flowy so
it's perfect for summer be so super
light and again we have a strap around
here and I like to wear this one with
like a big padded bra since it is flowy
I'd like to like bring out the boobs not
literally because the boobs are covered
but make them look really oh yeah they
sound more of like a creamy color
compare the other one which is like a
nude okay so I also got the same one in
black because I love the style so much
so again it's going to grow with like so
many different outfits you can wear a
high-waisted skirt for clubbing even or
you could wear filled inherited pants
which I were pretty much anything
including this top if you guys watch my
last video you would have seen this I
think it was my last one year my
Japanese trying Japanese pizza and ice
cream that was interesting um be hours
wearing this happening and I love it so
much it's kind of like a knitted
material it's just so comfortable and it
looks so good with like a blue denim oh
my god if you guys watch my last white
Foxhall you will see me wearing this in
a nude shade and I'm just like it's been
like what six months and I'm still like
obsessed the same style so that's
numbers
fashion oh my god I needed to see it's
so annoying and the next thing that I
have is this nude singlet so just a
basic I love the texture on this um yeah
I love the texture on this singlet
because it's like really bumpy and it's
just like they want unique then just a
regular singlet so it has a high neck as
well this looks so good with a really
dark tan oh my god I love this color
like I think my whole closet is married
actually no that'd be a lie but I would
like that a lot
and I also picked up these white how
waisted shorts it has like flats on this
side so it kind of makes it a bit more
different than just regular high-waisted
shorts the material is super thick I
know what it is about this material it's
so incredibly comfortable and I just fit
so nicely on me as well so I think
they're very cute the next thing that I
have is like a set so this is what the
pants look like they're high-waisted
because I have a long torso it doesn't
fit me perfectly but I guess if you have
a normal-sized torso earpiece so nice oh
I love the like pattern on it I don't
even know what that is so I think it's
really cute I love navy blue and then we
have the top so this is the crop it's
just like seriously perfect summer
because when it's really hot you have
this like really paper-thin material and
you're not going to be sweating or you
probably are because it's freaking hot
here in Brisbane the other day it was 41
degrees and I was wasn't loving it
that's all I can say I am so incredibly
excited to share this with you because
it's literally the prestress I've ever
seen in my life so it looks like this it
is a milky dress it goes a little tiny
bit past my knees it is so pretty and
elegant and classy I do believe this was
like $200 or something so it is quite
expensive but the quality of it is so
worth it so we have the v-neck down the
front which again it makes your cleavage
look amazing I love this like crossover
thing we have going here
and the color is so pretty it's like a
Beijing new kind of color love that and
yeah I just think this is on sleeper V
for clubbing
I'm so excited to wear this I tried it
on the other day and it was kind of hard
to walk because it is so tight and it's
just like a bodycon dress and it just
like sucks you in but I will get used to
that
I will because I'm going to be wearing
it a lot you guys are probably going to
be like why do you wear that dress so
much okay the next thing that I picked
up is this black jumpsuit this is
actually one of the most classy like
short jumpsuit I've seen I do think this
will be like perfect for like partying
or clubbing or anything like that
because it is super classy would like
the cake that goes over the shoulders
and then the v-neck that goes down here
as well so this honestly is like the
perfect fit usually jumpsuits are way
too small for me in a size 8 because my
torso is so long and I get like a
literally a massive camel toe and then I
go for a size 10 and it's too baggy but
I'm very happy aware that it fits so
well the next thing that we have is this
black jumpsuit sorry the top half of it
is kind of like to just use the material
that is the top and you can really do
the top however you want so you can
twist them at the back and do like
braids or you can make it backless
wrapped around your arms you can
honestly do so many different things
with it so it's super versatile and you
can wear it to something different like
occasions because it can look really
classy or it can look really casual
depending how you tie this up and then
the shorts of them are just like an
elastic band and the super short so I
think that's freaking adorable
everything that I'm sharing with you
guys today is like super comfy which is
definitely or why not
okay wow that's heavy heavier than I
thought so before this day I honestly
thought I had stripes but then I saw
this and I was like I'm living for this
so I think it's black or navy I'm pretty
sure it's black so it's like black
stripes on this white jumpsuit and then
it ties up around the waist as well so
I'm really perfect for that really like
slim waistline again it has a v-neck and
the sleeves on it a really flowy hiding
my talkshow columns this would have to
be one of my favorite things along with
that nooky dress as well it's just so
freakin cute
the last clothing item that we have here
is another jumpsuit I wanted to like 5
times since I've got it so it's just
like a little bit grainy right now I
have to wash it because it's back can
all over it so we have this piece of
like string that ties around the neck as
you can see here has a little like
pom-poms on it so I think that's cute
and then we have the cutouts at the top
they go like this so it is like a high
neck and then around the waist you have
a band so you can tile it up nice and
tight and then the back is backless oh
it is good to meet you it's kind of
backers I know it's hard to explain it
has like a bra strap that goes around
the back and then the rest is backless
you guys will see what I'm talking about
last but not least we have three liquid
lipsticks what is my hair doing so these
are the shades that we have it is the
brand gerard the brand the brand gerard
cosmetics we have a red a nudey pink and
then more of like a true pink so I don't
think I've used these no I haven't so
I'm excited to see how these are work on
my lips literally if I had every liquid
lipstick in the world it still wouldn't
be enough
I am so obsessed with the formula of
liquid lipsticks because they just stay
on for so incredibly long actually the
one that I have on right now is from
Australis and I'm going to be uploading
and twirling this look very soon I'm
obsessed with it cranberry oh and I do
have green our contacts in as well if
you're wondering why my face looks
different so there we have my white box
haul I hope you guys liked it I want to
play so excited to wear all of these
clothes as you can see I tried them all
on and they all fit so perfectly and
they all look so nice I'm super excited
I hope you guys liked this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye
