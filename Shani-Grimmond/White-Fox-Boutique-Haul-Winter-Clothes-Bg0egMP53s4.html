to my channel or welcome to my channel
if you're new nice to meet you
so before we get into the hall let's
talk about my background I'm so sorry it
looks really ugly right now it's because
I have an ugly desk and ugly bed on the
ugly ground because I'm moving tomorrow
so that's all I've got so you just gotta
bear with me it's gonna be my second
last video in this house yes I'm so
excited okay so everything that I got in
this video is from white box boutique I
literally had nothing in my closet
Belle's winter clothes I had probably
like five things in there that's winter
so I just had to go all out and go
absolutely crazy it just buy a whole
bunch of stuff and that's why I did it
I'm gonna share with you today so I
managed to get you guys a 15% off
discount code so if you want to shop
with them all you have to do is write
SHINee 15 in the coupon code box and
you've got 15% off storewide so I'm
gonna leave their link down below if
you're gonna check it out really excited
because I only got everything this
morning and I'm still like in that
really excited phase where I'm like
comment where are these clothes because
I'm obsessed with them actually there
was a few things that I got the other
day and then like the rest today because
they've got two separate orders anyways
let's get into it so the first thing
that I picked up is the top that I'm
wearing right now and this would have to
be my favorite top in my whole closet it
is something that's just gonna match
every single outfit I feel like I'm
gonna be wearing this top under like all
the coats that I'm about to share with
you so it's very versatile and it's
super comfy as well so it goes up around
the neck right here and it's just like a
thin knit material so comfortable and
I'm obsessed with it it looks like this
very cute very nice next thing I have is
this sweater right here it is just a
black and white crop so it has like kind
of flat detailing through it and the
neckline I'm not sure this is cool but
it's really fat so it's up nice and high
and it's so warm so thick and I don't
know I have so many knitted sweaters but
I feel like I can never have enough
because I just wear them with
high-waisted jeans and they go with
everything so I'm adding this to my
collection of like 200 sweaters the next
thing that I picked up is this new D
Brown blazer I got this because I want
to do a work kind of office makeup hair
and outfit video so I thought this would
fit in perfectly I don't really see
myself wearing it like on an everyday
basis I would I would think this is
something more for work but went on it
looks incredible so
you know if you guys want to see that
video because I need it to wear this in
that video Oh
the next coats that I have I literally
got in every single color because I am
that obsessed with him it looks like
this it's just like a really long trench
coat that goes around the knee area and
it has like a flappy thing right up here
on the chest and it's just super thick
and fat and warm and the material is
just such good quality and I feel like I
would be wearing this a lot because it's
something that can chuck over anything
and it's still gonna look cute so this
is the gray one right here I swear to go
on the last time I wore it I was like
sweating because I worked on that cloud
that's really not a good idea but yeah
that's how warm it is I'm not even
kidding you right now I also have a
beige one I love this color this would
have my favorite color in clothes like
hello I love it so exactly the same
style it has a really nice pocket in the
side to put a little cold phalanges in
it's all fingers the corn I'm pretty
sure that's it or is that toes I'm not
quite sure wait this coat right here is
sorry someone - the ones that I just
showed you except this one ties up
around the waist so you can make itself
look like really skinny because the
waist is like really tight and this also
doesn't have sleeves so I display this
as like a curtain sorry so I just wear a
bra and undies under it and it's kind of
like a dress code kind of thing and it's
just something that's so easy to put on
if you just want to clean your part like
when I go to the post office every
morning I just Chuck this on because I
don't want to wear like moment clothes
at the post office well it is normal
clothes but it's just like something
that you can check on to get what I'm
saying yeah this would have to be my
favorite thing in the whole entire haul
actually probably my favorite thing in
my closet but every said about something
but this overtakes that already so it's
kind of like a cape it doesn't have any
sleeve so you put your arm through this
little part right here so it's like a
vest at the front and then it came at
the back it's kind of confusing to
describe but once you see it on your bed
tell how beautiful it is it's just so
classy and so different to other things
that I have in my closet and it's still
gonna keep me warm so I actually can't
wait to share these with you because I'm
gonna be doing a lookbook and we're
gonna see how I style them and stuff so
I'll be doing a winter lookbook and
probably like two weeks or something and
you'll get to see how amazing everything
looks like head up with other clothes
like oh my god but yeah this is like the
best thing that's ever happened to me
oh my god oh my god okay so this would
have to be the last like winter thing
that I'm sharing with you I'm so sorry
I've just gone on a winter overload I
have nothing in my closet as I've said
so this is a and it is sweater I've kind
of similar to the one that I showed you
at the start this is just a plain gray
one again it has a really fat neck area
to keep you nice and warm and it's super
thick and heavy and the quality is just
all there I mean I also picked up this
oh my gosh I have pins and makeups in my
foot okay I can't just ain't all that
much sure all that so this a maxi dress
that I picked up it's a really nice like
creamy beige color it's kind of
different to the other base just said I
have so it has a high neck like this top
does right here and it also has splits
around the thigh area so it kind of adds
something different the reason I picked
this one up is because one it's so
comfortable and two I can wear it under
every single coat that I have here
because it's just something really basic
and you know when you wear like jeans
and stuff and it's really tight around
your waist I'm so over that right now I
need something that's just really
comfortable and feels like pajama is
about looks like Queen Bee say that's my
girl that one I also picked up another
pair of white ripped jeans I have had
these before and I have one than 100
times before but they ripped in this
little area right here and it wasn't a
little area anymore it was like a huge
hole I was just like bending down really
quickly and I went and just split open
and I was like oh my god so I was
looking around a shop for like the next
hour just like feeling really awkward
sounds like literally a hole like that
big in my leg but yeah I had to pick up
another one because they just Gardens
everything and that's so nice that kind
of how I sit on me
I've got a really long torso yeah that's
my camera doing yeah I've been a really
long torso so my belly is like super
stretched out so things that are high
waisted
on other people aren't really as high
waisted on me which sucks I love
high-waisted pants but there's a kind of
like halfway the high waisted but
whatevs
I love them there are size 8 and I fit
carefully if I forgot to say that I'm
not quite sure I'm not sure if I'm like
a size 8 or 10 in clothes but it just
keeps changing soon
that's why I online shopping scares me
sometimes but everything in here is this
oh it's small so love it okay okay I
also picked up this lace bralette right
here I've wanted this for the longest
time I mean how are look how freakin
nice
is I don't know what I'm gonna wear a
wig though because I don't have any
see-through tops I really want like a
see-through top that I can wear this
with and you can kind of like see this
through it but I feel like that's too
risky to out the see-through tops I
don't I'm gonna find a way to wear this
and you guys will see it and you guys
will love it
it also comes with G bangs but I mean I
don't want to wear these because you can
see like everything I also picked up
this black belt that has a silver kind
of like Callaway buckle on it I just
wanted one of these for a while now
because I have so many dresses in my
closet that kind of needs more structure
added to the waist area so I thought
well I can just buckle this up around my
waist and I can look a bit more curvy
kind of thing so I think this is
something that is gonna come in handy a
lot and I also want to grab a nude one
as well because that's super nice and I
feel like that'll go with a lot of stuff
I put a message I also got some loving
10 products I've used one bottle in my
life and actually was really impressed
with it so I just thought I'd give it a
go again and just get some more on thief
it takes over my love for Bondi sands
which is probably not going to happen
because what I send is my life but let's
just see how it goes so the first thing
that I have is the tan removing and skin
to polish team glove oh so it's just an
exfoliator I thought it was some special
tan or moving stuff but I don't know
I've got one of these already from a
different brand so I feel like it's just
gonna do the same thing but I really
like the colors I mean that cute I also
picked up the bronzing mousse is so this
one is in the shade box adapt mm-hmm it
says experience ten is only that's
calling my name and then I also have the
two hour Express docks and medium to
dark skin tones so this one stays in for
two hours and I'm pretty sure this one
would say on to up to six hours so what
I do is I apply it in the morning and
I'll just leave it on all day until I
wash it off and it literally stays so
dark well that's all my boy Mac sands
one so I'm assuming this would do a
similar effect I do not know how people
sleep with their tan on it is so sticky
every single tan I've used in my life is
so incredibly sticky and it's just like
how can you sleep with that
oh so the last thing that I have is a
pair of Windows
winter Smith is Lee's favorite shoe
brand in entire world I have a pair of
black boots from them that I pay like
two hundred and thirty dollars for so
really expensive but they literally look
as good as new
and I've worn them so many times so I
would definitely say that Wendy Smith is
worth the price because the quality is
just like on point so when I first look
at these I was like I'm obsessed with
them but when I got them I'm like oh I
don't know if he's gonna suit me I don't
know I think they're really pretty but
I'm not sure if they're gonna suit me
what do you guys think do you like them
so then we have my whole video I hope
you guys liked it I would have to say
that clothing hold videos would have
been one of my favorite because the new
clothes on my life actually but I'm more
of a makeup girl but it's weird that I
like feeling nasal probably because I
filmed so many makeup videos my life I'm
just like home I go with makeup you know
I'd never feel like all my god makeup
I'm like oh okay I keep talking too much
so yeah I won't stop now I hope you guys
have an amazing day and I'll see you in
my next video
love you like bye oh when I was hungover
one day I was vomiting that way when I
was feeling very but one day I was
vomiting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
