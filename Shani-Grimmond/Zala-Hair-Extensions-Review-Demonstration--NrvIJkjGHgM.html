channel so today's video is going to be
all about Azalea hair extensions and how
to apply them and all of that good stuff
I'm also going to be doing a review
about them and telling you my experience
so let's get started okay so the brand
is called a Sala hair extensions and
these are the extensions right here I
got the 26 inch 9 piece chestnut brown
and the only reason why I got hair
extensions is to make my hair appear
more thicker because it goes really thin
at the bottom of my hair so I wanted
them to make my hair look thicker so in
order to do that the extensions had to
be as thick as they were at the top too
all the way at the bottom because I know
lots of extensions are really thick and
they go really thin and look really
tacky and obviously I want my hair to
look real I don't want to look fake and
this is actually natural human hair but
anyways back to my point it is triple
rested so basically there's three layers
of hair not one so it goes as thick as
they are from the top two all the way at
the bottom which was wearing one of them
so that's why I think they are
definitely worth the price as they as I
said natural human hair you can curl
them you can straighten them you can
wash them you can do whatever you want
and there is a really good color
collection that you can you know go by
so you go online and you can send them
photos of your hair and then they can
suggest some colors back to you and if
you get the wrong color you can just
send it back and exchange it so it's
really good and also this shipping is
really great I got mine in literally two
days which is the quickest I've got
anything so that's a plus these hair
extensions aren't really heavy on my
hair so when you put them on like after
10 minutes or something it doesn't even
feel like they're there in my opinion
anyway and my head is really sensitive
my hair snaps so easily and with these
extensions I haven't experienced
anything like that so that's why I also
love this so much so now I'm going to be
showing you how I apply them okay so as
I said before I have the nine piece set
so I have two sets of five clips three
sets of three clips two sets of two
clips and two sets of these single one
clips all I do is start by parting my
hair so it's roughly in line with the
middle of my ears and then I'll just go
ahead and tie all my hair up so it's out
of the way and then I just run through
my hair with my fingers so it snaps and
tangle free and then I take a set of
three clips and then just start clipping
them in
now I'm just going to be parting my hair
so it's roughly in line with the top of
my ears and then I go ahead and clip it
up and then brush my hair for you just
so all the colors blend really nicely
and then I'll just be taking a five-set
piece and I'll start clipping that into
my hair and you don't have to worry
about teasing your hair to clip them in
because the clips are silicone back so
it allows for extra grip after I brush
through my hair really well I'm just
going to go ahead and part my hair about
two centimeters higher than the last
hair extension clips and then I'll be
taking a five-set piece and then just
clipping them in
so after I've applied the set of three
clip hair extensions I'll just be going
ahead and taking these single hair
extensions and putting them on each side
because my hair is naturally quite seen
I'm not going to be adding all and nine
clips in it so for the last one I'll be
adding a clip of three and then of
course I'll be going ahead and brushing
my hair out since the color is a little
bit off so when I brush it together it
all kind of blends nicely and also when
I'm brushing my hair with the extensions
in I just like to hold my hair as if my
hand is a hair tie and then brush it
because I don't want the clips pulling
down in my hair this is what they look
like when they're in I love how thick
they make my hair look because I have
want to stick hair for the longest time
now so I finally have it and as I said
before they are as thick as they are at
the top - all the way at the bottom as
you can see right here anyways back to
me rambling about how much I love them I
also got this little crystal droplet
here from Zara as well and I've been
looking for one of these for so long and
I think it's just adorable it's a little
