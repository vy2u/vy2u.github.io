be doing one of the most classic nail
designs in the history of history but
first make sure you subscribe to this
channel before you've even had the
chance to decide if you want to
subscribe
it's the classic French tip manicure
you've always wanted simply paint your
nails with the nude base
add some white add a glossy clear coat
and presto you are now a classic beauty
you know what I say you're boring French
tips
well hallo everyone it's me cuisine
again your favorite asshole nail artist
now I've seen billions of tutorials on
how to do french tip nails and I
personally can't help but think wow
those are boring no offense to people
who like them I mean it's all personal
preference it's fine but in my opinion
all hi sound like one of the obnoxious
people commenting on my videos the
traditional nude and white bullshit just
doesn't do it for me so I've put
together 10 different french tip
inspired nail art ideas that aren't
fucking boring let's get started shall
we
first up is this bright and colorful
obnoxious design that really breaks the
boundaries of what a french tip manicure
is supposed to mean that's right we're
starting off with a bang basically load
up some polish on a nail art mat and
then drag some designs in it while it's
still wet the best part is if you don't
like the design just make another one
right beside it then we're gonna let
that shit dry and paint our nails Hollow
obviously PS if you wish to know which
nail polishes I use for any of the
designs in this video I put links to all
of them down below in the video
description box and it probably took me
an hour to do that
so you should click them all when your
swirly or whatever design you made is
dry it will now be a sticker or a decal
that you can peel up but be gentle be
very gentle you're going to rip it if
you're not cut it into the perfect size
to fit on the tip of your nail and to
stick it on all you got to do is coat
the tip of your nail in some clear nail
polish or topcoat and stick that sticker
right on press that shit down on your
nail and you're done now we're gonna add
a glossy taco to seal it all in and band
you're looking flat for that 9 a.m.
office meeting next up let's put some
holographic foil on the tips of our
nails
Hey hello yay how about a hot pink base
coat just because get some hollow foil
ooh pretty unit take some foil glue
don't worry it's not crazy glue or
anything and just kind of freehand paint
the tip you can make it work let it dry
so the glue is no longer looking like
glue then you're gonna press down the
foil on top of the glue and peel it off
and obviously things did not go so
perfect to be completely honest getting
a perfect transfer with these kinds of
foil is pretty tricky and I don't really
use them that often so don't mind me
just a nail channel showing you things
that aren't working on my nails but one
thing I am is a problem solver so we're
just gonna solve that and as the edge
problem with some black polish and
pretend that I meant to make it look
like this there you go perfect sounds
good to me
and oh girl you fancy with those french
tip hollow tips are the new classic
French tip just sayin next up we got a
French tip that actually is a little
more classy for the office but is
definitely not boring starting off with
this kind of baby turquoise beautiful
new color by my friend Gianna from nail
storming I put the link for that below
too but this video is for you guys and
your nails so you decide what kind of
colors you want
on your nails and now I'm going to make
a stamped eco I don't know why I painted
the one on the left black I changed my
mind last minute which pattern I wanted
I'm using this new clear jelly type
Stamper that a lot of people have been
asking me to try it's pretty cool
actually I like how you can see through
it I mean I know that's the point but
it's still cool and I'm just coating it
in clear nail polish so that I can peel
it up later when it's dry if you're
looking for clear jelly type stampers I
put the link for this one down below in
the video description box
Pei you'll me off by a BPO Mei and now
kind of similar to the first design and
you just cut off the part you want to
put on your nail make your nail wet with
some other polish and simply stick your
french tip decal onto your nail cut off
the sides and you can use a clean up
fresh dipped in a little bit of acetone
to help melt the edges around the side
so it's a perfect fit add a final glossy
taco and you've got yourself a French
Dip manicure that's perfect for slaying
at the Country Club
except we've got kind of a split
personality French tip design the base
is nude so it's kind of for like the
boring part of you and then the tip is
multicolored because hey we're all a
little crazy sometimes
then add a hollow taco because I've
content with the boring okay again now
we're gonna do some dry brushing which
basically just means getting rid of most
of the polish and then messily painting
that shit on and then add a second color
and a third and a fourth and yeah just
keep kind of cutting around with it
until you like the look of it when
you're happy with your wild surprise
french tip manicure top it off with a
glossy taco perfect for the wild child
in you the best kind of tip in my
opinion is one with hollow glitter on it
starting off with the boring orange neon
ish color because animals trying to go
for variety in this video then we're
gonna do a glitter placement with some
black hollow glitter just add some clear
polish to the tip of your nail to make
it a little bit sticky and then use a
toothpick to pick up the hollow glitters
and place them one by one this may seem
like it takes a really long time and
well it does but the French Dip version
is certainly a lot shorter than the full
glitter placement nails seal it all in
with a glossy taco and perfect you're
just in time to spill the tea now if you
must be boring and wear boring colors
maybe because of an office job or some
other bullshit I'm gonna give you two
different options here okay starting off
with a dirty old muted rose color creme
polish adding a glossy quick dry taco
because we're gonna add
Lionel's necks yeah yeah these are
french tip nail vinyls by the way they
are curved at the perfect degree I put a
link for these down below if you want to
go the traditional route but instead of
putting white on the tip I'm gonna put
some silver hollow cuz business on the
base party on the tip if I still want to
be boring but you want to be a little
bit more edgy with your tip selection
have all this black hollow tip option
starting off with the nude base this one
is a little less pink learning and a
little more boring beige leaning adding
a quick dry glossy taco again so it
dries quickly and instead of using the
French tip vinyl I'm going to show you
another option on how to make a French
tip place the thing at the to be on nail
this is liquid latex and it's pretty
much the same thing as simply peel but
it comes with a very skinny brush which
allows you to do some cool detail work
with it like this put the link for this
guy down below when it's dry it turns a
darker pink and then you can go ahead
and coat the tip your nail in some black
hollow yeah you badass
peel off the liquid latex when you're
done before the nail polish dries and
you've got a smooth of a line as how you
originally applied to latex how good the
line is is up to your skill level at a
final glossy taco and there you go some
nails that should be appropriate for the
conservative office work place and if
they're not you could just shove them up
your boss's ass next up let's do some
fire nail art gasps this is one of the
more extreme French tips because it's
not really like a French Tiffany
manicure at all but hey there's some
shit on the tip so technically it fits
the definition for me paint your nails
black I'm gonna add some of that liquid
latex around the sides of my nails just
in case some shit falls over the edges
let it dry and now it's time to do
what's called a drag marble or a dry
marble because there is no water the
water
basically you got a pile on a bunch of
nail polish in different colors and
while it's still wet you got to drag
some amazing design in it before it
dries
assuming you're as skilled as a Russian
male artist then it'll look amazing
peel off the liquid latex and do any
necessary cleanup let it dry for a while
because it's gonna be quite thick and
wet and then seal it all off with a nice
thick glassy taco I did not wait long
enough for the polish under that to dry
so don't do as I do all right so I just
made that look extremely easy but I'm
gonna show you the truth right now what
up time to get real not all nail art is
easy okay not everything in nail art is
perfect this is my first attempt you can
see the anxiety shaking in my toothpick
my confidence is literally falling off
of my nail at this point this is my
second attempt come on hollow died me
show me the way it was just the color
scheme or I don't know but it was just
not working out anyways now you know
that life is not as perfect as Barbie's
french tip manicure okay next up we've
got this gorgeous sexy kitty cat ear tip
nails first we're gonna sponge on my cat
men she's very own baby pink hollow
glitter because it's fitting obviously
if you don't know why or what I'm doing
sponging it out and you should watch
this video next I'm adding a quick dry
glossy taco and I'm gonna let it dry
because we're gonna add nail Lionel's
next yeat these are cat ear nail vinyls
that I actually designed myself I'm very
proud a long long time ago in another
dimension I made this video using these
vinyls and that's when I promised you
guys a video for French Dip nails that
aren't boring
I'm totally gonna do that and make a
video on French Dip nail art that isn't
boring so here I am 8 years later so as
you can see all I'm doing here is just
filling in the head of the cat with some
black nail polish on the tip of my nail
before it dries peel up the cat ear
vinyl add a nice thick coat of glossy
taco and
all right cat got your tip and now we've
reached the final of ten different nail
designs that aren't boring naturally I'm
starting off with a black base coat but
then we're gonna put some holo on it
because my soul is not black it is
hollow it is rainbow if you think this
royal blue hollow glitter is stunning
well what do you know I made it well not
myself but you know what I mean all I'm
doing here is what's considered quite
the classic French tip design as far as
nail artists are concerned it's called
the glitter gradient and you start off
by brushing just a light amount of
glitter on the tip of the nail with the
brush and then you're gonna go in with a
small section of a makeup sponge because
you're gonna sponge that shit on the tip
just the very tip and make the glitter
more concentrated once you're happy with
the hollow glitter density at the tip of
your nail you can take the nail polish
brush again and kind of make a more
seamless fade between the little bits of
hollow glitter and then the packed
hollow glitter at the tip clean shit up
as you need to and then you know what's
next girl see you everything in with a
nice thick coat of glossy taco
this is especially key when working with
big hollow glitters and because I love
this classic badass version of the
traditional French dip manicure I did it
on my entire hand in different color
hollows naturally here it is black
hollow which and here it is with hollow
Queen all three of these colors are from
my collaboration collection of hollow
glitters unlike a lot of the shit I sell
these ones are not limited edition you
can still actually get them down at the
links below and that concludes today's
video now you are spared of all the
boring french tip manicure tutorials on
youtube the designs are endless the
color combos are endless the hollows are
endless and you baby you are endless
