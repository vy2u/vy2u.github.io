2015 yeah look at me doing so good and
that's a load less than PewDiePie posted
this year what the how does someone
post over 4 on your video and we still
don't even know its core message in any
case why don't you and I take a trip
down memory lane
to revisit what the hell I did this past
year and witness and nail our channel
turn into a well I have no idea either
channel ooh girl yet it's my intro mMmmm
this is one of my first original intro
porns we started off the nail by file
what'd I just say started off the nail
we started off the year by filing our
nail this is back in the day when I had
to keep Reax planing why my nails were
yellow now I don't do that any marks I
don't give up all right
2016 was a long last year so let's do
this quickly ready matte quilted nails
with the stuff you're supposed to floss
your teeth with which you don't do
enough of and your dentists is mad
manche oh my little baby oh that's not
her I'm throwing in the trunk me acting
out how I almost broke my nail but
didn't Oh clickbait talking about nail
polish I was going for $200 on ebay what
the floor and then I poured it all out
and pissed off a lot of people that was
fun although rainbow nails using
highlighters this is also the first
video that I started doing what's on my
other hand
thanks to my Twitter fan for helping me
nail that one down follow me thanks but
this was around the time when you guys
started getting off at peel porn you
skin weirdos what if I told you water
marbles are lies that's why we learned
how to cheat a water marble this was
part one of many 2015 was the year of
struggling with water marbling in 2016
was the Europe that I'm gonna cheat call
that water profession blue rainbow and
hollow foil pretty what the is that
Oh random fail Oh what's this Illuminati
confirmed
cheater water marble park - whoopsie do
drag marbling and why is this going
backwards oh it's because I was rapping

sophisticated piece of technology for

boyfriend painted my nails Oh what
cheated at water marbling again my
kidnapping a Russian it wasn't actually
a Russian it was my sister what's your
name again tried to explain to everyone
what the hell a hollow was this is my
reaction most of the time when people
still dream to understand explore the
many different body parts of unicorns in
the name of science charlie tested
whether or not we could peel off gel
polish with peel off base coat we opened
the door and we closed the door
we opened the door close the door stain
my nails pink in the process hallo and
kitty cats on my nails

what's the best hollow tuck also for
almost this entire year I was
intentionally mispronouncing top coat as
taco and no one really noticed unicorn
window to my soul nails means Easter
chocolate nails yeah oh I'm so dizzy
nails also this is when I discovered how
to do animations and I got carried away
into too many of them at a hollow taco
peel it off and call it an average
simply no logical day the time I did
vegan nails cuz I wanted to be hip and
on trend and it looked like a murder
scene that I was actually just spray
painting my nails
we vandalized some but then we
unbanned alized it because we're too
good Canadian citizens amazing smokey
rainbow nails that are a depiction of
what it's like when you're on drugs
Instagram nail two weeks later Instagram
changed their logo so I did Instagram
nails again a boyfriend water marbled my
nails and actually succeeds what the
 how are you doing this are you
which we water marbled in beer milk
sparkling water and watermelon juice cuz

cheating at water marbling by printing
off other people's water marbles putting

dirt on my face me realizing how much I
love being a troll

last time but this time over hollow
glitter so better it's I'm a mermaid
trolling again by saying that you can do
DIY glow nails if you paint the nail
