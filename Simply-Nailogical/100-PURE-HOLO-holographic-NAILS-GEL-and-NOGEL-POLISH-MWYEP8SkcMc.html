stuff oh sure I've got this new silver
chrome powder it's all the rage right
now no man I mean the good stuff you
know what I'm saying okay okay keep it
on the DL though I got this new multi
chrome powder it shifts two different
colors you like that come on man I mean
the real good stuff right now the
that makes you go wild I know you're
holding out on me okay I'll give you the
hollow powder and now I'll have to kill
you
well hallo to you to everyone just look
how hollow my nails are that's hollow
standing four holographic if you're new
here you should subscribe and join our
Hollow Kingdom today we're gonna play
with the good that's the purest
form of Hollow and powder that money can
buy I just asked my dealer whose powder
chrome trend has been picking up a lot
lately but of course I had to get the
ultimate hollow version and I got it to
work with both gel polish and regular
ngon gel polish much excitement excite
so in my last video with multi chrome
powder my gel nails failed because I
didn't have the right lamp because I
couldn't plug it into my wall so I got
this giant heavy fire like this is so
heavy it could weigh me down in an ocean
don't get any ideas now anyways I plug
this adapter in and bam it works whoa
it's so purple let's investigate oh it's
like an alien portal anyone there hello
hello anyone hello let's start off with
the hollow powder on gel nails first I'm
going to apply a peel-off base coat
because there will be people yes then
I'm gonna apply some black gel polish it
still freaks me out that it never dries
unless you put it under this lamp
course let's add another coat because
that was not dark enough curing the gel
from disease and there we go before you
get to go crazy with the good you
got to apply a clear gel taco that's top
coat for all the newbies fake mother
baked now I'm just applying some liquid
latex around my nail because that powder
 is messy you know drugs so I gotta
be careful kids protect yourself
truth be told though this liquid latex
actually ended up introducing some
complications you'll see why soon all
right
it's the hollow powder I praise the Lord
even the label is hollow my god sealed
for your protection what are they
concerned I'm gonna OD on too much
Hollow
oh my god hollow help me and whoa that
 is flying everywhere
I saw her went up my nose but I'm okay
with that it's a word on the street is
this is the real good know what I'm
saying alright so the company who sent
me the hollow powder also sent me this
silicone tool to use to rub it in so
that's what I'm doing this is my ring
finger nail that I'm recording right now
and it seems to be working pretty good I
did find that you need to apply a decent
amount of pressure though to get it to
stick and really work itself into the
gel taco alright it looks good to me
let's peel off simply peel like no big
deal yes I don't have to clean up thank
God now I'm gonna do my middle nail and
usually I would only show you doing the
middle nail since we're doing the same
thing on all nails except on my middle
nail it kind of up I don't know
what it is in my last Chrome nails video
my middle nail also kept up like four
times and in this video no matter what I
did and I did the same thing on this
nail as the other nails the hollow on
the tip of my nail was just really
cloudy like why is it cloudy you see
that why are there clouds
I won't sunshine no matter how hard I
tried to buff that dullness out it just
didn't go away so I wet a bit of a q-tip
and rubbed it off and thought maybe I
would try it again
morning water washes off the powder I'd
buff some more hollow powder into the
tip and it looks a little better than it
did before but it's still a tiny bit
cloudy and after a few more experiments
I realized that it's probably the fault
of the liquid latex on my finger
essentially what I think is happening is
when I'm pushing the silicone tool all
the way towards the cuticle it's
actually hitting the liquid latex and
then it gets this weird kind of sticky
latex e residue on it which transfers
back on to the nail and dulls the hollow
powder damn son the latex killin my
hollow vibes well I guess it wouldn't be
the first time latex killed someone's
vibe next I added a glossy gel taco
anyways hoping that it would kind of
revive the hollow it definitely made the
hollow stand out on most of the nail but
the tip was still a little bit cloudy oh
well what can you do we live and we
learn but as I was applying this gel
topcoat I realized why I should never be
a nail technician the brush of my gel
topcoat had now hardened and there was a
bunch of bristles that were stuck
together we can see here that I was
using the gel taco while the nail just
beside this nail was curing as evidenced
by the purple alien light and yeah so
I'm a dumbass basically anyways let's
just cure that one more time I'm just
accepting my mistakes guys okay it's
very healthy you should try it still
looks pretty good though right I've seen
some other holographic nail videos by
other youtubers and such and I think
that there's really different versions
of hollow pigments for instance the one
I have I think it's more of a chrome
hollow because the hollow is so dense
and so closely packed together that you
couldn't even tell what color was
underneath whereas I've seen some other
videos where the hollow is a little bit
more dispersed and it's not as much of a
chrome effect with the hollow because
this one's so dense and super packed I
guess you could call it the crack of the
cocaine you know this is coming from an
expert who did a lot of high school and
grade school projects on crack and
cocaine crack crack crack crack crack
addicted to crack all information is
good information build that knowledge
kids build it oh yeah let's have a quick
lights-out party
minutes in hollow heaven click the like
button if you want a video of that's
just hollow for seven minutes and that's
it and now one of the most anticipated
moments of the evening the peel porn I
promised you why don't you guys sit back
relax grab yourself a Shirley Temple or
a Starbucks passion empty lemonade and
feel the peel bet your bottom dollar I'm
going to save these Kiwis under my
pillow alright pick your jaw's off the
ground and now let's do the same thing
but with regular polish and see if we
can make it work starting off with the
peel off base coat as always then I'm
using one coat of my new favorite black
creme polish I put the link below for
that then we got to apply what's called
a water-based topcoat because a regular
top coat will dry too hard and the
little hollow powders won't stick to it
water-based topcoat however are more
sticky so the powder like gets right in
there now I did have a little fun with
this so I'm going to show you that first
and then show you what I did to fix it
so I started with my middle nail this
time and that was the last nail that I
just applied the water-based topcoat on
this will come into play in a second at
the beginning of buffing in the powder I
am finding that it just really doesn't
want to stick to the water-based topcoat
at all I tried the bottom of my finger
like I've seen in some other videos with
powders that did nothing the silicone
tool does work a bit better to kind of
really push it in and get it stuck but
yeah obviously it's not really working
but persistence is key right started to
press down really hard and buff it back
and forth a lot and I noticed that it
was actually sticking I don't know what
took it so long it's not the cleanest
application but it does appear to be
kind of working so after I spent like 30
minutes working on my arm trying to get
it to stick to my nail I moved on to my
other nails the hollow powder just
wouldn't stick anymore like at all on
none of my other nails except the middle
nail and then a light bulb went off in
my brain middle
now was the last nail that I'd added the
water-based topcoat to which meant that
the topcoat still would have been a
little bit wet and on all the other
nails it would have been completely dry
by the time I went to put on the holo
powder so I decided to redo it and
before I did I went to wash my hands
just because I was curious what would
happen when water went on to the hollow
and yeah obviously water dissolved the
drugs time to peel it all off and start
over
except this peel porn is so terrible oh
my god this peel porn is so cringy oh
the cringe
all right here we go again my nails are
so wasted right now peel off base coat
regular black polish water-based taco
and only let it dry for about 1 minute
until you don't see the bluish tinge
anymore buffing the hollow powder again
but definitely bring your patients with
you because this took a long time to
work it in real good I also skipped
adding the liquid latex around my nail
before starting to buff the hollow and
hope to avoid that ugly cloudy effect
and I think that helped because I'm not
seeing any clouds all right it looks
pretty good so far right now to deal
with this that's all over my skin
and one of Ellen dishes recent videos on
Chrome nails she showed that you can put
the liquid latex on the that's all
over your finger after you've already
done the rubbing in of the powder then
you let that dry for a couple minutes
and peel off simply peel back no big
deal and bring all the drugs with it
didn't completely get it all off my skin
but it definitely got a large chunk of
it all all right now let's move to the
middle nail and the reason why I showed
you this order is because you can see
that some of the overspray from the
buffing from the nail beside me is
already on my middle nail okay so shit's
gonna get a little confusing here so
listen up if you really care about how
to do this if you don't then just enjoy
the hallow the shot you're seeing now is
before I added the water-based topcoat
to my middle nail since there was
already some hollow sticking to my nail
I figured well why don't I just see if I
can rub it into the black creme polish
so what this means is that you can buff
the hollow powder into the nail polish
itself without even needing a
water-based topcoat however you can see
that the application is not
completely perfect and there's a lot of
patches where it's not sticking since I
still had some patches I thought okay
well what if now I add the water-based
topcoat and then buff on top of that to
try and fill in the patches I waited
about a minute and then started rubbing
in the hollow it mostly worked except
for a few tiny areas that I'm going to
assume was because of the imperfections
on the first layer but she live and
learned so I added some liquid latex
around my nail to peel off all that blow
come for the hollow stay for the porn
I'm adding another water-based taco on
the hollow to seal it all in but I was
expecting this weird to happen look
at all that science but it didn't seem
to happen at all with the hollow powder
which is really weird I don't know all
these Seabees are very different
ingredients alright how about we compare
the hollow powder on gel nails versus
the hollow powder with the regular
polish gel nails version looks a little
bit more 3d and with the regular
polished version it looks a little
flatter and the hollow is more dense
like closer back together
aside from a little bit of hollow
clouding with the gel nails you can
definitely see way more imperfections on
the nail when doing this with regular
polish and my guess is because these
powders are not supposed to be used with
regular polish from what I understand
it's really just a thing for nail techs
and they mostly use gel and that other
weird I don't understand also I was
a bit afraid to wash my hands and get
the hollow powder off my skin but hey I
could make this look work it's just
highlighting for your fingers I was
afraid this would happen yeah that
happened to my chrome nails after I had
a shower so I added a second water-based
taco thinking that would really help
seal it and protect it wash my hands and
good news it did not destroy everything
also look at this hollow in the dark
woohoo Peep Show I'll show you my hollow
if you show me yours
one last science experiment before we go
let's add a regular quick dry glossy
taco on top of the water-based topcoats
and see if they destroy the hollow it
looks fine so far
try another nail and yeah that's getting
pretty cracked out that's some Vampire
Diaries right there
strangely enough it didn't affect my
middle nail at all like what is going on
why are all the nails different the
pinkie got dug though the thumb also got
so with that I'll leave you guys with
some mediocre peel porn I hope that you
learned a lot about the different kind
of powder drugs on the nail market today
and yeah please subscribe to my channel
so you can support my lifelong dream of
living in a house entirely made out of
hollow and thanks so much for watching
I'll see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
