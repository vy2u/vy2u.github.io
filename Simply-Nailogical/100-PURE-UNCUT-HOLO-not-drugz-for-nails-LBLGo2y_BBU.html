baby I'm just gonna flick flick flick
okay after I get up yeah I flick it up
the fake holo I've got real holo
well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again today we gonna play with some real
holo flakies for your nails as all the
holo sexuals up there no holo is short
for holographic and holo for nails comes
in many forms on this channel to date
we've already played with the linear
holo powder that first made an
appearance some time last year we also
tested out some hollow sludge stuff once
you got holo transfer foils as well
paulo glitter that you burnished into
the nail and obviously hollow nail
polish but today we're gonna try
something new loose holographic flakes
it's a hot cost shit that'll keep you up
on that long I have a few different
kinds of hollow flakes from different
brands but first we're gonna figure out
what is the best application method cuz
this shit is loose how the fuck do you
get it on your nail we're gonna figure
it starting off with a bunch of swatch
sticks that I've painted black you could
paint them any color I just like black
because it really helps you clearly see
how the hollows going on first let's try
a coat of glossy taco that's clear
topcoat in English I'm just gonna take a
makeup eyeshadow applicator to pick up
the hollow flakes of a cat
there's so pretty I just love the
asymmetrical shards of rainbow and while
the taco is still wet we're just gonna
dab it on and yeah I knew this wouldn't
work but I wanted to show you guys what
happened it's gonna apply messily and
the sponge is probably just gonna pick
up the black polish underneath next up
let's try the fan brush method I applied
a glossy taco first and before it's dry
you can gently dust on the hollow flakes
by tapping a fan brush over top of the
nail this will get you a very dispersed
scattered holo effect looks like a
galaxy cool but it's not enough hollow
foamy let's try the dip method coat up
my nail and glossy taco to make it
sticky and then dunk that shit right
into the pot Apollo wanna bathe in this
shit unfortunately while this definitely
gets the whole nail coated in hallow its
kind of messy and the surface is really
jagged and not smooth let's try the same
method that I found worked for glitter
burnishing you can watch my other video
on that so we're just applying a sticky
base coat in this case I'm using yellow
stopper I'd let it dry for about a
minute and then you're gonna dab and
drag but not too hard the hollow flakes
on the nail using this technique is a
little tricky because you have to be
careful not to push the undercoating of
the nail too much if that makes sense
but it's definitely working hollow yeah
dust off the edges that didn't quite
stick and Wow okay this one is the best
so far haha yes I missed a spot shut up
now let's try a glossy gel taco I find
when you're working with the hollow
powders they applied
Jennsen with us over a gel topcoat but
always got a big fat shit for a minute
before you start buffing in any powders
so I'm just gonna buff in the hollow
flakes the same way as I with the hollow
powder and it's working yeah buddy
hollows here the hollows are here
however application over gel polish
makes the hollow flakes much finer and
more of a linear hollow look because
when you compare it to the application
over a sticky base coat method that made
the hollow flake stick on more jagged
interesting what interesting scientific
experiments we are having today
another application option we can
explore is using a makeup sponge it's
pretty much the same kind of spongy
material as the eyeshadow sponge but
let's see if it makes a difference well
the makeup sponge is a lot bigger so
you're definitely getting the buffing
done faster but I don't see a difference
in how the flakes appear on the nail at
least when you compare it to using an
eyeshadow applicator over a gel taco and
so far just in case we were wondering
this is all the same brand that I've
used on all of these test applications
watches so far we'll get into different
types of hollow flakes later in the
video all right guys well look at all
these options what do you think
personally I can't decide between the
gel taco application one and the sticky
base coat one I think they're both
beautiful one hallows a little smoother
the other one's a little more wild you
know it just depends on what kind of
moves you in but if you're not a gel
polish user then that makes the decision
super easy for you is you can just use
the regular polish and sticky base coat
method to get this beautiful shattered
jagged hollow rainbow look okay
experiments part 2 now we're gonna play
with a few different brands of hollow
flakes I'm gonna use the gel application
for all of these just to keep the second
part of the experiment controlled first
step one of two hollow flakes from born
pretty store honestly I wouldn't really
ever recommend born pretty store to
anyone just because they're shipping
takes like months and the customer
service is not that good in my personal
experience as a paying customer anyways
it is real hollow
and here we have hollow flake number one
and here's hollow flake number two also
from born pretty store this one appears
to have larger sized hollow flakes so
let's apply it and see how she goes oh
my god I love buffing things so much
it's so relaxing definitely looks a
little better than the first one I would
say let's try another one this one is
from twinkle tea and I will link all the
different hollow powders in order of use
and all the other stuff I use in this
video down below in the video
description box anyways this hollow
flake application is going well mmm yes
I love the odd bigger flake it's just so
blinding now let's try another one this
one is from ocean nail Supply beautiful
beautiful as I'm applying this shit it
all kind of seems the same I so far
haven't noticed any difference in
quality with any of these except for the
very first one I tried from born pretty
store and last up we're gonna try these
hollow flakes from solar color dust this
one comes in a bit bigger of a container
who else loves macros of these flakes it
looks like you're staring at a bunch of
CDs that were ground up into tiny pieces
it's beautiful actually speaking of
ground up CDs we've done that before too
let's take a brief look back on my old
video from back in the olden tastes
December 2016 where Christine still
didn't tell her I scratched off the
little internal bits of the CD and made
this beautiful magical hollow flake mani
I wouldn't say that the hollow flakes
you can now buy from nail stores are the
exact same thing as if you were to
scratch a CD apart because the flakes
from the CD are a lot thicker and they
don't really sit flat on the nail but if
you're looking for a DIY nail hack for
cheap then you CD instead okay back to
the pre ground holographic substances go
on and buff that Halloween girl buff it
in cuz there ain't no hollaback girl
ain't no hollaback girl beautiful just
like the others
alright let's move on to the evaluation
phase of the different types of hollow
flakes I think it's pretty clear that
the first born pretty sir what I used is
different than the rest it seems like
the flakes are a bit smaller than the
others and the hollow is a little duller
as for the other four I am genuinely
struggling to find any differences
between them does anyone see a
difference yes if you look at them in
the packaging maybe they look a bit
different but who cares what they look
like in the packaging because what I
care about is how they look on the nail
just like your makeup we should care
about how it applies on the face how it
looks in the packaging beauty gurus and
so conspiracy theory I think it's
possible that these four different
brands all got the same holographic
flakes from the same hollow dealer oh
shit we got a crackdown on the war on
holo how about we add a nice thick coat
of glassy tack oh whoa look the topcoat
darkens it
since I'm not sure that there's any
meaningful difference between these four
hollow flakes I think that price and the
amount you get for that price will be a
deciding factor for you guys if you
wanted to get one of these hollow flakes
I've left links to all the shops down
below in the video description box and
I'll leave it up to you guys to check it
out and now I think it's time that we
put the real hollow on my real nail
bitch but first let's talk about what's
on my main tutorial and it is a
fascinating combination of a basic blue
polish talked with iridescent greenish
bluish glitters and then topped with the
holographic flaky topcoat kind of
similar to the hollow flakes that we've
been playing with but in nail polish
form first I got it oil up so we can
peel it up yeah come for the hollow stay
for the peel porn Oh be careful though
YouTube might be monetize this video I'm
sorry I'm gonna have to censor it now
say for YouTube alright let's paint a
yellow nails
hila base coat first then black nail
polish then a glossy gel taco and yes we
have some hollow overspray from doing
the nail beside it bake that shit for a
minute and do kind of a dabbing and a
buffing motion I'm making sure that I'm
doing a bit more dabbing rather than
just buffing and rubbing because I want
some of the bigger flakes to actually
stay intact because I like the large
chunky hollow you know what I'm saying I
like my Hollow thick girl
I thought it was gonna be annoying to
get it off my skin kind of like how it
is the case with the linear hollow
powder but it's pretty easy you just
dust it off with a fan brush BAM done
boom out add a nice thick coat of glossy
gel taco wow look at that it's like
deepening the hollow
I think I'm gonna do a second coat yeah
no I do not have a hallo problem and
then add a nice thick final coat of
glossy jail taco take that shit for a
minute beautiful some of you may be
wondering if you can do this with the
regular top coat instead of gel top coat
and the answer is it won't work for
buffing in the hollow flakes as we
discovered earlier but if you use the
sticky base coat method under the hollow
flakes like we went over earlier in the
video and you could absolutely top it
with a regular top coat and it looks
like the regular glossy taco does not
ruin the shine or the hollowness of the
flakes at all yay I love rejoice
honestly I am loving these hollow flakes
I personally love the more scattered
jagged hollow look because it just
shines so much brighter from far away
rather than a linear super smooth look
so these hollow flakes are gonna be my
shit from now on tiny bright like a
diamond another thing I'm left wondering
is that these hollow flakes as far as I
know only come in silver hollow they
don't come in different colors of hollow
like we see with the loose hollow
glitters but what if we made them
different colors let's experiment if you
have any sheared jelly polishes applying
them over the hollow flakes looks
fucking cool how about we do some dry
marbling oh yeah look at that Russian
water marbling cheap hack talent coming
into play today that looks delicious
like a Jolly Rancher I want to eat it
there are so many colorful possibilities
jelly polishes are basically just very
diluted translucent polishes with a hint
of color but if you don't have jelly
polishes why not just use some school
supplies use your highlighters who
remembers oh gee simply an illogical
doing this over silver hollow glitter
back in the day it actually works a lot
better over the haul of flakes rather
than the hollow glitter because the
flakes are much smoother on the nail dam
so beautiful alright well that's all I
got for you today I continue to be
amazed by the many different forms of
hollow that we can put on our nails the
options just keep coming and it's often
real hallow can't say the same for the
make-up companies when can I put these
on my face okay
simply face logical with like hollow
flakes on her face please can someone
please make that safe
I'll be waiting alright guys thanks so
much for watching and I'll see y'all
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
