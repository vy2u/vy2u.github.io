the Twitterverse has alerted me that
there is a reaction video about me
college kids react a 100 plus coats
challenge bracket hashtag Polish
Mountain coach back at college kids a
should I watch it should i watch it do I
want to watch this I asked you guys on
snapchat if I should react to this
reaction and let's just say that was the
highest number of screen shots I have
ever seen and this means I'm gonna have
to relive my life choices doesn't it
alright here we go
that was my shoulders cracky I'm so old
prepare for the rows of caramel popcorn
life looks gross just a tampon ad
don't bite your nails don't bite your
nails like the popcorn ma all oh
everyone it is I Christine watching her
videos for the first time when you were
like yesterday looking at my nail polish
just peel base coat while we let that so
awkward and isn't it how do all the time
we do this that is my question I don't
have time to do it I shouldn't have done
it
my god I'm printing out your own voice
right now hungry and angry maybe she is
but I like her yo look at her yeah that
is that's wrong math me if I washed my
hands my last roll of taco now I knows
who taught me do they and to my nail
sure that I honestly look so sad as it
is right the peel porn she gotta say
they were funny
oh thank you oh my god guys look at my
ghost skin it's showing my anxiety
imagine this witnessed the most
disgusting but beautiful masterpiece
disgusting but beautiful on long nails
it's one of those beauty channels huh
one of those beauty channels it actually
a right angle you see a written about Oh
150,000 new subscribers yeah humans are
just beginning here just because of this
one video oh you got everyone to do it
rothenburg has managed why don't people
just call me Christine like who refers
to people by their last names been
interested in nail art since she was 15
saying known as the girl crazy nails
where did I even say that I don't
remember weird thing you know who puts a
hundred codes until a psycho put a
hundred sixteen layers of nail polish on
their hand
total clickbait do you mean cliques 8
but the definition of clickbait is that
you were misled by the title or the
thumbnail and that wasn't actually what
was in the video but I actually did the
Polish mansion so it's not click mate
fall into the hole of YouTube once you
watch one video then he watch black
excited single facet in addition to nail
art rothenburg also posed challenges and
vlogs
sometimes featuring her boyfriend and
cat she's only posted like one vlog ok I
can do more I guess it's a curiosity
like what does that under it cuz they're
all such weird little twins very common
people there's a foundation oh yeah all
the other all the actual beauty channels
yes pre nail polish Queen Wicca wait why
are you so girls to just make up like
come on now what's a clear nail bomb I
deeply regret that to look like little
sparkly like ice cubes on her finger
whoa that is clean nails made with
vegetables and even Donald Trump nails
using your cat's fur as his hair that's
so funny oh cool what Wow
I like how all you had to say was she
put Donald Trump on her nails using her
cat's hair as his hair and oh I think I
might subscribe cuz watching her video
today and hearing a little bit more
about what she does make you want to
check her out no I'm not in jail and
stuff like that I'm not interested in
stuff like that I'm not interested in
not interested in
not what crazy things should do yeah it
do cuz she's really funny and like I
like her sort of humor where it's like
dry and witty talking I like just kind
of like dorky and I like that well for
my age group I think it's age group how
old are you
I'm 27 we're gonna go exhibit it 100
layers thing insane
super funny oh yeah there aren't a
hundred ways I'm insane think I'm gonna
get myself a man do that you slay that
Manny sugar guys I'm like literally
shivering like I have goosebumps like do
you want to see oh you can't see but
there's goosebumps there I don't know
what's so weird about seeing other
people react to me because normally I
just put my videos out into the internet
and I never actually see other people
watch them I just see all the trolls in
the comment section I'm just glad most
of their reactions were positive must be
because when kids go to college they
discovered their hollow sexuality so
this was really crazy and awesome and I
am flattered and kind of overwhelmed
with anxious butterflies right now that
people even thought polish Mountain was
worth reacting to no it's interesting
though when they were mentioning the
other types of challenges that came
after polish mountain like hundred
layers of lipstick and whatever they
didn't mention the weirdest one of all
which was 100 layers of it ejaculate a
Jacke ejaculation on someone's face I
never meant for it to go that far
even though polish Mountain was one of
the dumbest things of that in my life I
want to thank you guys my subscribers
for suggesting it in the first place
because I would not have done it if it
weren't for your stupid ideas I also
want to give a big welcome to everyone
who subscribed since polish Mountain
it's true that a lot of people did
discover me after that fateful day in my
life and of course a shout-out to
everyone who is here since before polish
Mountain all those were the good old
days when Christine replied two more
comments basically thank you to everyone
we should do a megi reacts to college
kids react to an undercoats challenge as
dick belch Mountain I know you all came
for Munchie didn't you I just realized
they didn't show men'she in the video
those people don't know what they're
missing
and she's like stop using me for your
videos alright guys thanks so much for
watching and we'll see y'all later bye
bye I love you so much let's do a mangie
