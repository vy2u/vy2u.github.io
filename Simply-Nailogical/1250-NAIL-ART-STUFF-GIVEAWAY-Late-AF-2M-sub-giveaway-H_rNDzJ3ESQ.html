million subscriber giveaway before I hit
three million because you know those
hollow sexuals are savages
yeah yes they are hello it's me maybe
wondering why I'm wearing cat ears still
since Halloween is over you can keep
wondering remember how it made all those
promises to you guys that the two
million subscriber giveaway was coming
soon yes I am planning a massive
giveaway to celebrate 2 million the
giveaway will be unlocked soon I'm lost
I'm lost
can we look on my patient
I only lied about the soon part okay but
the time for my two million subscriber
giveaway has finally caught up today is
the day rejoice
marina rejoice this giveaway is gonna be
lit it's gonna be examined
ah the giveaway is gonna come through
coming through you're gonna be shaking
your shook chipping and shaking and
shaking and J shaking ship shook
I'm just trying to keep up with the new
trend vocabulary so I can communicate
with your generation
now I could be really basic and give
away a free MacBook so I could get a
really big boost in subscribers instead
of how many people subscribe who
actually like my content all the
comments be like oh the shape the shape
but since this is a nail art channel
kind of sort of sometimes not really
though I'm going to be giving away a
bunch of awesome nail art products from
my friends at twinkle T if you didn't
know they were my Hollow dealer while I
was in LA did you see that deal go down
in my la blaw there we go
oh yeah keep it on the DL okay there's
gonna be five winners who in all of this
 that's over $250 worth of nail art
products for each winter or 1,250
dollars worth of nail art products being
given away in total okay for math bitch
I'm sitting here with just one example
of what one winner is gonna get oh wow
don't worry you're not getting this one
let me show you what's gonna be in each
prospect a shitload of stuff first we
got a pack of 15 nail art brushes so
many different brushes in there for
people who can paint my personal
favorites have got to be the long ass
striping brushes I like how you can kind
of pretend you know how to do a straight
fine with us a set of three
unnecessarily fancy looking dotting
tools with some crystals in the middle
of them because you're not just doing
nail art you're doing nail art bitch
they're also double-sided and have
different sized heads on each end a
bunch of loose glitter because glitter
herpes two different wheels of nail art
studs so you can rock it with your nail
art brush of this random thing that's
full of letters maybe you can spell the
alphabet to glass nail files which I
only ever use because they are much
better than regular Emery boards and
you'll get a blue and pink one but don't
go assuming their gender four packs of
cuticle pili apron protector thingies
you put these around your nail you've
probably seen me use them recently and
there's no latex in them so that's why I
wanted to include that because you can
use them whether or not you have an
allergy to latex a bunch of fancier
brushes two of which are cleanup brushes
because nobody is perfect the other two
brushes are fine detailed brushes and
they all got that fancy crystal rock
 in it so you can look fancy as you
paint is actually a practical use for
those crystals and the general larger
size or girth of these types of brushes
makes the brush a lot heavier which
allows you to have a bit of a steadier
hand when you use them of course I'm
going to throw in some makeup sponges so
you can do the dab bitch Deb look at my
damn bitch that I'm not going to sing
that any further but you can watch my
simply illogical greatest hits album
number one to hear the song info' lots
of packs of striping tape every nail
artist needs some of these and a
shitload of nail vinyls because of
course you're getting nail vinyls
there's over 20 in here that I
hand-picked to be included in this
giveaway a lot of them are my faves or
ones that I helped design and then some
random ones because why the hell not
also I'm including these new holographic
skinny stripe vinyls because they're
hollow a metal cuticle tool thingy I
don't really use these for my cuticles
to be honest but I find it extremely
helpful to peel up nail bottles
don't forget the nail art mat it's great
for making your own decals and letting
it dry and peeling it up later it's also
great for practicing
and it has some finger tips for you to
do that on this mat is different from a
lot of the other nail art mats in a few
ways the first is is a lot thicker and
it doesn't stain apparently it also has
these color patches along the side
that's the first I've seen in nail art
match has this crater like corner for
you to put little beads in small little
circle sections all that and this mat
has this random Cup on it that does
these things ha ha ha pull it up push it
down pull it up push it down pull it up
pull it up pull it up shoot I can't keep
up with my hands ah yes Oh some tea and
yes please thank you very much now I
know what to do with this putt though ya
gotta get a little ice in there that's
what it's for
ha ha didn't you just have nail polish
in it nail polish gives me life
disclaimer do not actually ingest
liquids or otherwise from objects that
have come into contact with nail polish
don't be an idiot or you could use the
cup properly for a watermelon put water
in the cup maybe you'll learn something
and drag it into your water marble and
you were supposed to demo this see there
that's all you got to do well right now
not you them I mean what and you think
