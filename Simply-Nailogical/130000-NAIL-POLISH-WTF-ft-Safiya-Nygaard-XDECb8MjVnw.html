entire way yes yep you got it

it's taken me four months to roll it
back really bad story guys hope they're
here yeah would we just proton the class
the hell just massage therapy oh no I

Christine is is stressful to have your
hands in someone else's hands I'm like
the worst planet and I apologize whoa

I don't know it's purple we might
believe it yep they think should ah yes
yes ha ha ha ha it depends American
cross the line robbery

wealth of the tree okay wasn't on press

one trouble will collect yeah yeah drop
of the only devices committed
you just want to get it done here
looks like anything nothing no fancy it
does make me feel fancy
yeah we you say cold where Elizabeth
water sprinkles you know alcohol
I thought we're dry Robin wishes hang on
like a normal income and then I can do
it off later
that was a cuticle
we're going to do an accent nail on each
hand that has authority on it because
you can't put the gold leaf on the
models or polish the ring finger of each
hand is going to be like a black base
coat and then we're going to put the
gold peels on there this is a family
goals like use excuse me so it's made of
gold in there it has a goat
this man will know what if I drop it so
there's only two of these in the world
yes pretty long phone commercial I hope
that I don't know yes
funny how it doesn't say anything on it
about what this is real gold morning
don't like it that's all I love today
also decide meet you oh my god - can I
get a job you guys hired yeah we
conducted hey you what funny cuz like I
Felix just from working at Mizzou they
know how expensive the nail polishes the
glitter is quite fine you know if it
does it quite nice
revive the shimmer is quite nice
hallo time she meets top of that that
like kind of bucks 700 bucks in there -
I saw in the window came back although I
did it everywhere was the same thing
photography when they do gold facials
I think yeah and it's the same stuff you
so you like multi-purpose for
and hot
going in with a glossy taco so that
looks like Antarctica to me oh yeah yeah
and you kind of almost got like the
bottom of South America somewhere one of
them is Australia doesn't it kind of oh
nice thick coat a glassy taco oh yeah I
like that you guys not wrap the tip yeah
are you wrapping that that's a good
practice I feel fancy as old I feel
fancy I asked you guys what do you think
what do you think yeah I need that what
was it Portland
that's good like crack it's amazing yeah
I know it is they're cracking stuff yes
Americans act well how does it feel
having thousands of dollars on your
nails honestly there's a lot of pressure
I don't want to chip it you know it's
like all the value for link that's in
its most perfect state and as it chips
away like I'm losing money like
depreciation like if you buy a Lambo and
then it just appreciates my Lambo and
drive around the doors open and just
appreciate the Ambassador so I don't
think I would ever spend that much money
again on a Polish instead if I were you
I would recommend investing in your
education down payment on the house
pretty much anything else yes be
probably a financial security kid that's
what you need to take away from this
video make sure you subscribe to my
channel for more videos not like this
because I'm never paying for this again
I mean it's okay but it's not hollow and
the one thing is like if you're going to
be spending a hundred and thirty
thousand dollars on a bottle of nail
polish if it's not Hollow and like what
was the point
speaking of hollow what did we do on
your channel check out our collab in
which may dressed head to toe in
holographic clothing we hallo gang says
I'm saying we don't have Mirchi yet so
there's nothing to put as a bio but you
should pray to the hallowed church eyes
emerge if you can end your search we
don't have any merch but like Morticia
and lurch there you go
nailed it that's the end of the city
