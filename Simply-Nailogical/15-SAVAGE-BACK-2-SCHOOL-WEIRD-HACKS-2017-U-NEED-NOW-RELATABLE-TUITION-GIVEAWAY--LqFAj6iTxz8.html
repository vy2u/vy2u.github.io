have to do work to do good in it so
stupid but don't you worry because I've
learned so many school hacks even though
I'm no longer in school I know I'm just
so relatable my life is exactly like
yours
hello everyone it's me Christine again
and it's that time of year again when
youtubers post a bunch of back-to-school
hack videos I decided to watch a bunch
of them to get into the spirit and Wow
I learned so much that my brain hurts
being a student is tough okay I get so
that's why today I'm going to take what
I've learned and teach you how to wait
and um make sure you click Subscribe
before you watch this video and write it
up again don't forget to hit the little
Bell singie to turn notifications on I
don't know if they work half the time
but you should click it anyways click
because class is in session oh wait no
there's also a giveaway will do maxilla
make sure you stick around to the end of
the video to find out and now class is
time for you to learn
let's get on to the Hat you ever get
super bored taking notes in class the
Nick pack is for you girl
try writing each line in a different
color pen it doesn't really matter what
you're writing as long as it looks cute
oh my god so cute or you could actually
focus on the list and take notes with
whatever pen you have and just highlight
the most salient points the teacher puts
emphasis on because your notes are not a
fashion show do you ever get hungry in
class because you totally forgot to eat
breakfast
oh it's low-key embarrassing like for
real if you can't wait for normal
mealtimes just go through all this
elaborate work to scheme some snacks
into class Reggie stop attacking the
class take an exacto knife cut out a
hole in your textbook that I don't
really think you need to read anyways
then just take your favorite snack and
put them in your new secret compartment
okay bonus if you're really hungry one
morning then people will just think
you're really smart because you keep
opening up your textbook just eating
breakfast before you go to school or at
least bring a granola bar to class
research shows that students who eat
breakfast perform better academically
you ever get thirsty in class but when
it look cute while you drink just take
your water bottle add some food coloring
to it
shake it up it's like shook oh my god
I'm so shook up get it and pour the
water into a big ziploc bag don't forget
to seal it and staple it onto the front
page of your most boring notebook for a
DIY lava lamp
finally interesting notebook just add a
small opening for a straw and then it's
almost like you're drinking the smart
thing written and your notebook 2017 is
my gear of like realizing yeah oh my god
I love this pack so much I'm so smart
for thinking of it it totally slaves my
life just why why have you ever had a
take home as they do but you can't reach
this stupid word count for the life of
you well I got a hack for you because I
love you forget the word count you need
just scroll down to the end of the
document and add a whole bunch of extra
words it doesn't matter what you writes
I'm just going to select all the words
and make them what
absolutely you could say that this hack
was extra and such a doors usually
teachers aren't that stupid instead how
about reviewing your paper to see what
supporting argument you might be missing
that could help back up your thesis and
actually improve your paper you want
straight A's without studying
I know cheating is like wrong or
whatever but you're a savage right yeah
if you're not ready for a test just
write some cheat notes down but not on a
piece of paper or your hand because that
would be too obvious and you get
expelled or whatever instead write your
notes on a private area like up your
skirt or on your side or maybe on your
boyfriend because then if your teacher
asked to see that's like harassment or
something
or you could just study have you ever
tried that I call it the using your
brain instead of your body to get
through school hack you ever want to
bring makeup to school but hide it from
other people just empty out a glue stick
and put lipstick in there to fool your
friends no one will ever know because
you're so clever prank oh my god I just
realized that glue stick and lipstick
both end with stick
well what about your actual school
supplies we want them to look cute right
that glue stick bottle is so facing all
you got to do is put the glue you pulled
out of the glue stick before in the
lipstick tube that you remove the
lipstick from and now you have trendy AF
school supplies why the fuck does anyone
read any of this I hope you glue your
lips together don't know the answers to
your multiple-choice exam because you
didn't make any effort to study it just
cover your entire scantron sheet with
chapstick and that way the machine can't
like read it or something I'm not sure
how this works or if it works at all but
I'm going to include it in the video
anyway no this does not work it takes
about 30 seconds of research to debunk
this if anything it will just invalidate
your test but not only are the youtubers
who suggested this hack encouraging you
to cheat they're not even right because
it doesn't even work it's almost like
they only care about views
have you ever had a note-taking
emergency because you wrote like the
totally wrong thing down me but forgot
your whiteout at home well this next
hack is lyft just whip out your white
baking soda base toothpaste and cover up
your mistake much better that really
worked why do you have to face at school
now what would it back to school a hack
video be without a period hat guys those
pesky pads and pants by making a secret
transportation device using a giant
filing folder will just cover up all the
clear parts with fun cute designs bonus
right school supplies on it to come up
even smarter it's kind of a weird hack
but it works it's super weird I'm so
weird or you could just keep a pad or
tampon in your backpack or purse that's
kind of what they're for you have
trouble waking up in time for school why
does it always have to start so early
and I write one simple hack that is
guaranteed to wake you up is to attach
sharp objects to your snooze button on
your alarm clock so you literally stab
yourself when you try to go back to
sleep oh my god Savage
do I really need to explain why this is
fucking stupid
or better yet don't go to school at all
just be a good liar and use this Colin
stick hack just lay your head upside
down on the edge of your bed or a chair
and it will make you sound really sick
who needs an education I'm just going to
make slime videos on YouTube who the
hell are you even calling teachers don't
answer phones go to class
you idiot if you have to go to school
then you better
release make sure that you look hot do
your usual Instagram inspire makeup and
put on your cute outfit but oh no what
if it messes up your makeup just put a
plastic bag on your head and then just
pull your shirt over the bag on your
head good job genius
you could have suffocated and you messed
up your hair is Chad VP boyfriend bio
texting you asking for nudes but you're
like in class and can't text back
because because you will get mad at you
for not paying attention just take one
of your arms out of your sleeve yes
process leave on your desk so it looks
like both your hands are on the desk and
then use your now free arms of Texas
Maddie news back under the table that
was easy guys
even if you're an adult there are so
many reasons why it's a bad idea to send
intimate pictures of yourself to anyone
please don't let anyone pressure you
into something you don't want to do or
anything you're not sure of
is class ever so boring that you could
just go to sleep but you have nothing
comfortable to sleep on so you don't
grab a pair of water wings and blow them
up for a DIY class NAP pillow bonus
points if they're Disney Princess
did you know that sleeping through a
lecture means you won't retain any of
the information it's okay if you didn't
because you already look like an idiot
so basically cheat
don't try and skip out on school what
great role models
if you thought those hacks or advice
we're stupid and you're right and let
that be a friendly reminder to always
question the advice you get from people
including youtubers including me for
example you wouldn't take my advice on
something like I don't know carpentry
nope and so maybe taking serious
academic advice from someone who dropped
out of school to make youtube videos
wouldn't be the best idea either
Fila can be mean I'm not trying to shade
any youtubers I'm more questioning the
culture of these kinds of videos on
YouTube I wanted to point out what is in
my opinion a problematic culture of
school hack videos that really aren't
about school or education or learning
and they're more about superficial
clique baby things even cheating that
tend to involve pretty much anything
except you're intelligent
get ready for some simply real tack I
don't do this often so take note this
may come as a shock to you all but
school isn't supposed to be easy it's
supposed to be hard work what are you
going to use everything you learn in
school later on in life absolutely not
school is not really about memorizing
the periodic table or learning
Shakespeare school is more about
developing a good work ethic learning
time management skills self-discipline
working with others and so many more no
matter the subject of the test or the
essay your ability to study apply your
skills improve them and learn new ones
is what will benefit you later on in
life I think we can all agree that the
school curriculum no matter what country
you're in isn't perfect
I'm not saying that school is the best
but you're going to get out of it what
you put into it and this was brought to
you by simply mom logical storytime when
I was 19 years old and I was in my
second year of university for my
criminology degree I was working
part-time for a lawyer in the summer I
thought I wanted to go into law so was
working for a lawyer that made sense I
was in his office one day and he asked
me if I was going to school to get my
Mrs degree I looked at him confused
MRF not I'm doing a BA and he just kind
of looked at me and laughed and said mrs
dozen mrs. degree yeah that mother he
was trying to imply that I was only
going to university to find a hiding
excuse me for some reason that moment
has stuck with me for the past ten years
and I've used it to motivate myself to
go farther in school and to try harder
and to be independent and to get my own
success honestly I'm an independent
woman I love you Ben Vance
Ben I still love you and after that I
finished my degree in criminology then I
got my master's degree then I got a
great job as a crime statistics analyst
which I still do today if that lawyer
could see me now
so take that mama song
bitch a slur no matter how old you are
or what field you're in don't let anyone
tell you that your education isn't
important ultimately go to school for
yourself and be proud when you finish
things when you accomplish goal it's
great to feel like so few youtubers talk
about school with actual school not
school acts that maybe I'm
overcompensating a little bit here
please don't let academic education be
forgotten don't give up my children love
simply mom logical I know I can be
annoying it's fun and now we have a good
way that I promised you right instead of
just giving away a song next book I
thought I would do something a little
different and hopefully more meaningful
