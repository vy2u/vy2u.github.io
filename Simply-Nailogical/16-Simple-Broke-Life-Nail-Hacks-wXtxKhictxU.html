that happened in 2016
we'd be broke as hell and needing to get
our nails done
well hallo everyone it's me christine
again and welcome back from your
christmas slash holiday season hangover
whether that be from drinking too much
or spending too much money we got at
least one of those things in common so
now it's time to learn some nail hacks
for your broke-ass generally don't make
these kinds of videos because I mostly
agree with spending a little bit of
money on products that actually work
well on your nails so that you struggle
less but I know not all you guys have a
day job yet to make that cash money
maybe you're a broke-ass student been
there done that I know how it is so
let's roll with this guys make sure you
stay to the end of the video because the
last hack is the fucking best also
please subscribe and click the like
button I'm just going to slide that in
there no one will notice it's harmless
it's painless just click it just do it k
thanks bye broke a nail hack number one
so Christmas is over now you got all
this wrapping paper and if your family
likes you enough they might have even
wrapped your presents in hollow so what
are you gonna do with it don't throw it
out obviously you're gonna keep it and
put it on your nails this was a test I
got all this hollow rapping people from
the dollar store you could try and cut
it out to size to fit your nail and
stick it on but my guess is if you have
really curved nails like mine it's
probably just gonna pop right off so we
got to be creative okay now I'm putting
on some black nail polish yes it's from
the dollar store - no I don't really
like it because it's not opaque in one
coat Oh Christine is such a yeah you
just I hate her the red pattern has
squares on it so let's cut it out like
that I had some clear polish and stick
the wrapping paper right on my nail and
now it's a present you're welcome and
sticking with the cheap theme we're
gonna use this dollar store quick dry
coffee taco fYI it didn't dry in like
half an hour would not recommend ooh
green challah that kind of looks like a
tree oh let's cut it into a tree yes
Christmas is over but fuck it BAM I cut
a tree learn
shit in grade 3 to get on my nail I'm
gonna fail when I go to the doll store I
got a hassle my money like myself trying
to make a dollar I make a dollar out of
15 cents try to make a dollar ok you may
unsubscribe now bye boo silver hollow
I'm just gonna distract you from that
terrible song I just did not sing look
at all the possibilities we got all
sorts of triangle shapes
who needs nail foils we got this am i
right there maybe just sticking up in
the corners but no one else will notice
unless you point it out because no one
else is paying attention to your nails
but you beautiful yes you've just won
Christmas I can see BuzzFeed's next
article heading now average broke women
try Christmas gift wrap on their nails
but what about men we need some equal
gender representation in this video
these are my boyfriend's fingers he
resisted doing this but I made him do it
I got this middle finger gift wrap from
the holiday thread banger box and I
figured well that's appropriate for the
mood sighs your man's finger up I
normally don't like when we do that add
some clear polish or glassy taco and
there you go
go fuck yourself nails thanks thread
banger for the next bro kak you're gonna
need a little baggie no not that kind of
bag you drugged out a regular ziploc bag
like the one your grandma put cookies in
and made you take home from Christmas
dinner leftovers now we go on take some
dollar-store polish hey Billy
what's up and this is the closest thing
I could find to hollow paint that shit
on the plastic bag because we're gonna
make a deagle that's right other humans
call this word a decal but I say dqo
cause it's more fun to say try it look
at me doing a drag marble holy fucking
shit this was really guys did you see
that I'm fucking good at this the fuck
it's the classic cat clock it's back
again about five hours later I can go to
peel it up when it's all dry and there
you go a cheap alternative to those
fancy nail art maps if you ain't got the
cat place it on your nail and then use a
toothpick to help outline the edges of
where you're going to cut it and that's
broke nail hack number three instead of
using one of those fancy cuticle pushers
just use a toothpick cut it to size
you have scissors in your home if not
you could just do this part at school
don't tell them I said that but some
kind of polish on your nail doesn't
matter
oops I got a hair but that also doesn't
matter because we're gonna stick the
decal on and there you go you could you
just got your fuckin nails did for like
no money bitch
no money alright now we're gonna try
some traditional nail art techniques but
using the broke-ass hack first first I'm
just painting some dollar-store nail
polish on my nails I can't tell you how
much I'm loving these polishes hey now
normally to do a mess free gradient I
like to use either some liquid latex or
these cuticle pili tape things help
prevent the polish from getting all over
my finger today we're using glue because
today we are a broke-ass bitch and
because everything is good now an
ancient simply illogical history I once
made a video about which of these pili
methods was the best and the glue was
deemed the worst hyphenate glue i hate
it and this video is basically Kristine
tortures herself but if you don't have
or don't wanna or can't buy the fancy
peel-off products just use glue you got
a glue what you got a glue am i right
instead of using a fancy cleanup brush
like all the nail actives to clean up is
it polish on the skin I got a tip for
cue use a q-tip hahaha just don't stick
it directly on your nail or you're gonna
have some furry nails hey maybe that's
another hack broke nail hack number six
don't throw that makeup sponge you just
used to do a gradient just cut the
Polish side right off and bam there you
go fresh sponge ready to dab dab dab all
over again and no you can't clean your
sponges it doesn't really work nail
polish hardens so yeah just throw that
bit out it's time to steal some more
school supplies and use these whole
reinforcement thingies instead of nail
vinyls or nail stencils these circle
thingies are great for creating a French
tip but don't make it a boring French
tip make sure you watch my video on
French tips that aren't boring as fuck
you wouldn't want to be that bitch in
school just saying oh well fuck me no I
was not wearing a peel-off base coat and
yes I'd use the dollar store quick dry
top coat which does not
I so quick so okay look it's okay to be
short on cash but if you're gonna spend
your money on anything related to nails
I highly recommend to getting an
actually good quick dry top coat cause
you're always gonna need the quick dry
top coat you know you got to be smart
with your money also also hollow by
Hollow
instead of spending your hard-earned
money or your parents money on dotting
tools you can just use the tip of a
bobby pin it's got some dots already on
it two of them look at that
perfect and what if you don't want to
spend money on nail art brushes use your
head by using your hair you heard me
right you can cut off just a harmless
little bit of the bottom of the tips of
your hair it's fine they're probably
split ends anyways and use that to
MacGyver your own paintbrush tool here I
suck my hair on a pencil yes I know I
did this in another video
but it seemed to be perfectly suited for
this one now what could you use instead
of all those fancy nail art mats to have
a working canvas for your masterpiece
well broke nail hacks number 10 it's got
the answer for you start eating your
yogurt and saving those plastic lids
because these are perfect for messing
around with different colors or using it
as a painters workspace to help get your
brush going could clean this with water
for acrylic paint or acetone to remove
the nail polish if you wanted to it I
don't bother because I just eat a lot of
yogurt so I have a lot of lip and I'm
too lazy for that shit holy shit are you
still here good because this hack did
not work out
apparently you can take a loofah like
the thing you shower with cut off just a
tiny piece and use that on your nail as
a stencil for a mermaid a slash
fish-scale look it sounds so simple but
it never fucking works for me not this
time not last time and now this is me
trying to save that ugly mess that I
just made well I tried broke nail hack
number 11 because we're deleting the
last one it was shit the dollar store
sells holographic tape bitch look at
these beautiful pink hollow stars
they're silver hollow on the back the
design on this one it's practically
already made for us so let's just cut
that out
DIY nail stickers but hollow so better
so many types of holographic tape so
many possibilities
it any which way you like you got the
freedom now that Christmas is over I'm
positive you can find a tree somewhere
with some tinsel on it
if the tinsel is hollow take it keep it
use it if it's not throw it out because
since we're broke now we don't got money
to buy a hollow polish so we're gonna
find hollow in the real world to put it
on our nails huh genius lifestyles of
the hollow sexuals you could do a hollow
French chip thing if you have flatter
nails if your nails are curved like mine
that ain't gonna fly so here's an
awkward looking swerve on my nail also
hollow ribbons don't forget hollow
ribbons you unwrap that present you keep
the hollow ribbon girl when you ask for
a bows for Christmas and you get this
instead of this but it's okay because
broke now hack number 13 is about using
that unicorn skin bow on your nails I've
used unicorn skins before here on my
channel in the form of cellophane but
this hack is about salvaging the unicorn
skins from Christmas presents you're
gonna take the unicorn skin peel easy
you're gonna cut them up into tiny glass
like pieces put some glossy taco on your
nail and then stick them on BAM DIY
shattered glass nails easy peasy
oh so cheesy so I'm sure by now you've
seen all those fancy chrome nails on
Instagram and you're like bitch what the
fuck is that magical powder holy shit
it's that much for that little well fuck
that well broke now hack number 14
aluminum foil nails you too can be a
basic insert here and bitch but a
thrifty one just take some aluminum foil
press it against your nail to get the
right shape cut it out and stick it
right on that's it that's all you got to
do wow I finally found a reason to take
a luminance oil out of my kitchen drawer
what the fuck do people even use tin
foil for these days seriously I don't
even know comment below
does anyone use this for anything oh
shit you might have sharpies at home if
not you have them at school maybe so for
hack number 15 we're gonna take some
sharpies and color our chrome nails so
now we can be a rainbow bitch you can do
any design you want but I prefer to go
with the most colorful or obnoxious ones
that's that's just my personal
preference up to you and now for the
final broke nail hack putting CDs
you're now hey maybe someone gave you an
album on a CD for Christmas and you're
like what the fuck man I download my
music bitch how old even are you well
now I got a use for that CD CDs are
hollow so never throw them out destroy
them you must keep them love them praise
them kiss them and then you can smash it
to get to the hollow now I broke this
off camera inside my sweatshirt so it
didn't fly everywhere so please do it
safely inside a sweater or get a parent
or guardian to do it I should probably
say that anyway it's like for your
safety right yeah now I know hello may
feet did a video on how to use CDs on
your nails but her technique for
removing the hollow on the CD was a
little bit different what I'm doing is
just scratching off tiny little pieces
so that it's actually like flaky similar
to flaky nail polish you ain't got money
for flaky polish no you just got shitty
CDs you want to destroy with anger wow I
want to roll my entire body in this now
there's a few ways you could put this on
your nails
you could try tapping it on with your
finger but I got a lot of men Chi furs
doing it that way
mange it's probably just as easy to take
a toothpick lick the tip of it to make
it a bit wet and place the hollow CD
flakies on just like that you could
cover your entire nail like this if you
want that looks amazing it's like broken
glass but hollow glass you could do like
a boardwalk or a winding pathway Apollo
how about a shattered hollow glass
French tip that's definitely not boring
or a simple glitter gradient whatever
you decide don't forget to add a quick
dry glossy taco on top to help seal all
the little shattered hollow pieces in
and hollow shit I think my nails should
win album of the year and that concludes
