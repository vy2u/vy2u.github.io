Christine again if you're new here and
have no idea what the hell I just said I
meant to say hallo okay it's short for
holographic see all the rainbows in
front of your face right now are you
getting a little tingling feeling
throughout your body if so then you're
probably hollow sexual welcome to the
weirdest nail art channel on YouTube you
should subscribe so today I'm gonna show
you things I've already shown you but
I'm gonna show them to you all again in
one video because that's what youtubers
do I've got 20 DIY nail art hacks up my
sleeve I notice that every time you put
DIY in the title or the thumbnail more
people click the video it's really weird
because to me every time you do your own
nails you are doing it yourself anyways
now watch me do everything myself
the first tack is using liquid latex
when you're doing messy nailer you put
liquid latex on your skin so that way
when you sponge on gradients instead of
having the nail polish go all up in your
cuticles and all over your skin all you
got to do is peel off simply peel like
no big deal well that's what I say
that's the product I use you can check
out the exact one I use at the link
below
pretty much any liquid latex product
will do some are just a little better
than others well remember when we used
to use tape and acetone and q-tips oh my
god the horrors guys this is like
medieval times I mean seriously the nail
art industry has come so far now we can
just peel off all of our problems
peel you guys are so weird because you
requested this the latex is single-use
only and then when you're done with it
you just throw it away like a rubber the
next tack is about reusing your makeup
sponges to do gradients and no I don't
mean putting it in the dishwasher
because that doesn't work basically nail
polish dries up crusty so when that
happens the only way you can clean the
sponge is to just get rid of that crusty
edge did I just say end I meant edge or
end I'm not sure maybe both I just made
up word sponge cruelty I know guys
please don't sue me har I'm a dragon
by the way I'm putting the links to all
my videos in this video below that makes
sense
the next tack is more stuff about
sponges this one involves ripping it
it's really fun to do rip them rip you
so you can use the jagged edges of a
ripped makeup sponge to do a really easy
galaxy nail basically requires no talent
I love this one you're relying on the
asymmetrical edges of your rip sponge to
create something nebular and fantastic
yep and this is one of those no fail
manis because no one can fail at this
literally OOP Leakey's enough Leahy's
do-it-yourself galaxy nails like every
other nail art almost unless you go to a
salon
that's not DIY connect tack is one of my
favorites that I've been doing since I
came out of the womb it involves using a
makeup sponge again but this time to
maximize glitter payoff so all nail
polish has some kind of liquid in
it right by applying the glitter on the
sponge the sponge will absorb the
liquidy part of the nail polish but
leave all the glitters on top of the
sponge so that you get more glitters on
your nails yes science or something I
often hear people complaining all the
glitter polish takes so many coats well
obviously you don't know the sponge
trick do you always start off with one
thin coat of the glitter polish just to
make the nail
jakie and then go ahead and statue
Spungen so lesson of the day
when in doubt sponge away connect tack
is something i don't do to my teeth
enough and that's using dental floss do
whatever you want on your nails and then
apply a matte topcoat because it only
works if it's matte it doesn't work if
it's glossy and you take those little
toothpick or dental floss or things and
start making lines on your nails a lot
of people like to use this technique to
create a 3d quilt design and yeah that's
all there is to it Chanel nails or
granny nails you decide the next hack is
for people who cannot freehand paint
with a steady hand for the life of them
I am one of those people so you're
trying to paint a straight line and then
you up well if you used acrylic
paint then all you have to do is scratch
it off with the toothpick this is very
important it only works if you had
previously applied a quick dry top coat
and let that fully dry for at least 20
minutes otherwise the toothpick will
just dig into the nail polish I like to
paint with acrylic paint sometimes for
this reason because then I can undo all
my mistakes like a control Z for your
nails
now what about achieving super smooth
brush strokes with your nail art brushes
a lot of people think you need you know
the best nail art brush to paint well
but I hate to break it to you first you
need talent but you could also prep your
nail art brushes a little better all you
need to do to make your brush strokes a
little smoother is dab a bit of cuticle
oil in it don't soak it too much you
know you just need a little bit and then
you're gonna wipe it off on a paper
towel to get rid of the excess without
Doyal
with oil but what if you don't have nail
art brushes did you know that you
probably have hair on your head yeah I'm
not being crazy here I'm serious I took
a little piece of hair from my head just
from the edge of it at the tip very
split ends doesn't matter it needed a
trim anyways licked it a little to make
it stick together and chopped it right
off just took a random lead pencil and
tape to my hair onto the end of it pull
out any stragglers strands and there you
go you got yourself a custom truly DIY
nail art brush like I said you're also
gonna need talent to paint but you know
you're one step closer now maybe your
creativity will be inspired because you
took hairs out of your head I don't know
what this is it's a heart the things
around it I'm so good at this if you're
too cheap and lazy to buy some nail art
brushes and you're probably too cheap
and lazy to buy a dotting tool and you
probably have this DIY dotting tool at
home lying around it's a bobby pin who's
Bobby and what did his pin look like I
want to know just take the tip of the
bobby pin dip it in some nail polish and
there you go you got a perfect circle
sort of I'm really not good at doing
dots
add just a note of advice though don't
put the bobby pin back in your hair
after there's no polish on it just
putting that out there in the next hack
we're going to be using a toothpick
again I love my toothpicks I pretty much
use them for everything except my teeth
and maybe you have some loose glitter
lying around and if you don't to ask a
friend to glitter bonding in the mail I
get many of them I quite enjoy it
actually I think a lot of people think
you need some professional tool to pick
up these little glitters but not these
ones these loose glitters are super
light so all you need to do is lick the
tip of the toothpick that's right ladies
and gentlemen just like a tip of the
wood and here is six hours of my life
condensed into six seconds because the
loose glitters are so light the
toothpick will pick it up no problem
this is what happens when you stab
yourself with the toothpick in your
hollow sexual you bleed hollow glitter
the next tack is doing nail art not on
your nails nail art mats they call them
are really popular item these days
they're made out of silicone and they
let you do things like this on them and
even fake water marble designs like this
one because I love cheating you let them
dry on the silicone mat and then you can
peel them off like a sticker or a deagle
decal whatever tomato tomato
nail polish nail polish doing nail art
on a mat first is really helpful to some
people who want to practice their skills
because then if you mess up you didn't
just ruin it all over your nail you
ruined it on a mat and you can easily do
it again the next hack is more of a nail
polish hack as opposed to a nail art
tack but that that's Imagi hair that's
my cat
whenever you're applying neon polishes
it's best to apply them over white so
you can really make the beyond polish
pop now a lot of neon polish companies
will say that their neons don't
any undies going commando are we not
everyone has that specific kind of neon
polish and not everyone really feels
that that's an accurate statement
essentially whatever neon polish you
have lying around your house it will
probably be brighter if you put it over
a white polish the next tack is from
ancient Greece no actually I have no
idea who came up with it but it involves
taking saran wrap bunching up into a
little ball and then mushing it all over
your nails randomly now what if you
don't have much nail polish well first
of all we can't be friends but I will
still teach you this hack this one is
great if you're bored in math class
although it requires some homework you
got a sponge on some glitter first then
while your math teacher is blabbing on
about sin Coast and trigonometry and
other things that you will never use in
your adult life just color that liquid
highlighter goodness onto your nails and
bam you got yourself a rainbow Roy D bib
represents another school supply item
you could use to color your nails with
our sharpies or permanent markers you're
gonna need some rubbing alcohol rubbing
not drinking alcohol scribble those
sharpies on a surface that doesn't
matter preferably not your parents
kitchen table they might get upset and
kick you out early when you mix the
rubbing alcohol in with the Sharpie ink
it creates a really cool solution it
cools and bleeds really interestingly
don't know how to explain it and it
looks like bacteria and you should go
back to chemistry class you could put it
straight on the nail just like that or
you could put it over top of nail vinyls
like I'm doing right now so you can end
up with a cool pattern now your nails
are permanent the next tack is for
stamping polish and I don't do much of
this so I don't even know how I know
this I probably stole this idea summer
from the internet once you stamp the
stamping polish onto your skin you can
take it off easily with a piece of tape
no nail polish remover needed don't ask
me how this works I have no idea how
this is even possible it doesn't make
any sense to me
another hack is to just get a robot to
paint your nails just kidding never
trust a robot with
nails the next tack is pretty well known
among the nail art community but hey
just in case you knew here let me
introduce you to it using nail vinyls is
one of the easiest ways to create nail
art especially if you have very little
free hand talent like myself you could
use nail vinyls or striping tape or even
just regular tape to create straight
lines on your nails and yeah this was me
on a Christmas cocaine binge these days
nail vinyls come in so many different
shapes and patterns like it is
ridiculous you never need to learn how
to freehand ever again ho ho glitter ho
the next hack is for people who don't
want to spend money on new vinyls all
you got to do is get a loofah hopefully
you spent money on that to wash your
body with all you got to do is cut off a
little piece and wrap it around your
nail gets a little tedious so just hold
it a bit tight take a makeup sponge put
some polish on it and then start dabbing
it on top of the loofah I don't know
what the hell this is it just looks like
a scaly reptile but yeah let's go with
that it's a scaly reptile you could also
mix it up and take a whole bunch of
different colors and sponge it over the
loofah design to give off more of a
mermaid tail effect
um oh never mind let's just pretend this
hack never happened
the next cheat is for people who truly
fail up doing anything on their nails
and you know what it's okay I am one of
them sometimes we can't all be perfect
or rushing to take a design that someone
else did or that you find on the
Internet in my case I like to steal
water marbles you print it off on
special waterslide decal paper I put a
link to the one I use below and you can
watch a more in detail video about how
to do this I put the link somewhere
floating I don't know maybe it's in the
corner after having applied clear polish
on the decal and then soaking it in
water the decal will slide right off the
white paper and then you can stick it on
your nail I take much pride in my stolen
designs okay and finally the last tack
is for all my hollow sexuals out there
if you're not sure if you're totally
feeling your nail art or maybe you want
to spice things up a little or maybe
you're just bored add a hollow topcoat
or hollow taco as we like to say because
no one can understand the words that
come out of my mouth I've also made a
video on what's the best hollow topcoat
because there's several things you need
to know including two major different
kinds of hollow topcoat basically what
it does is it makes whatever design
under it shine like rainbows look at
that okay it's prismatic it's beautiful
although his life Paolo is love live in
the hollow moment I just feel like
everyone in this world needs a little
extra sparkle I would put a hollow
topcoat on people if I could and that
finishes off my 20 DIY nail art hacks I
