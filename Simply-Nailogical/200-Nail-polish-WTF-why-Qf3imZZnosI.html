hello hello hello it's me Christine
welcome to my channel I got dressed all
in blue and by that I need just my shirt
I'm wearing sweat pants because today's
video is all about this blue nail polish
I'm blue da ba dee da ba da knows that
song cuz I'm old so apparently this nail
polish SD starry starry night has been
sold online for up to two hundred
dollars on eBay and other black market
why so it's widely recognized as a
highly coveted rare collector's item in
the nail polish addicts world as
evidenced by so many blog posts so many
of them there's even news articles that
wrote about it so naturally I had to get
it and test it to see if I could find
it's $200 worth of value
if that just made you really anxious
didn't it it's called nail-polish
flooding therapy I'm a professional palm
down
I didn't just waste $200 on the floor
cuz I got three of them no I'm just
fuckin with you again I didn't spend
$600 on these three nail polishes I
actually bought the new replica of these
Essie starry starry night polishes and
they cost like six dollars each which is
way more reasonable I just realized they
came in a China Glaze package though
weird okay short history lesson Essie
made the original starry starry night
polish in 1997 or was the 1985 I'm
getting mixed messages here and then
they discontinued it in I have no idea
and a bunch of people got mad and so it
became a highly desirable but rare hi
chicken price item but then don't duck
down recently in late 2015
Essie rerelease starry starry night as a
part of the retro revival collection of
six different polishes I saw the other
five polishes reviewed on cue polishes
channel and did consider getting them
but then I was like those pinks and reds
and beiges are far too interesting for
me my nails could not handle the
excitement anyways I don't have the
original Essie starry starry night to
compare the new version of it to but
many nail bloggers and I mean many many
many Finnick were incredibly bummed
isn't really that close to the original
story story that even feels like a
cop-out everyone's freaking out about it
now bloggers do report that the new
starry starry night is nothing like the
original so it's not really a rerelease
of the one that was valued at $200 at
all is
there goes title of this video in any
case this is not the same as the
original and some people are really
really mad according to a very random
group of women venting in a Facebook
group Essie half-assed this polish Essie
disappointed a lot of people with this
nail polish just some party people
thought there'd be diamond dust in this
nail polish but there wasn't
and basically bitches are angry now just
for a second let's forget about whether
the new nail polish is exactly like the
original and just see if we even like it
alright all right let's get up close and
personal the first coat went on okay
kind of sheer and jelly like but I guess
that's what this polish is a jelly but
then it got really sticky at the tip
look at that look at that disgusting
stickiness maybe it's a fluke and I just
completely forgot how to paint my nail
so let's try to get on my other finger
nope this is just incredibly hard to
paint on your nails let's try a second
coat to even things out does each layer
mimic the night sky I believe I can fly
see all my silly string across sky I
think about it every starry starry night
SC you make me wanna cry I even had to
fix my damn cuticles cuz this nail
polish was so challenging to put on my
nails properly now let's add a glossy
top coat and see maybe now something
that's worth two hundred dollars will
reveal itself I'm looking I'm looking a
bit harder I see blue I see sparkles I
see silver sparkles in the blue but I do
not see $200 I cannot find it someone
please help me find it and as a
self-identified hollow sexual this nail
polish does nothing for me so I think
even if the glitters were smaller and
the remorse I'm like in the original I
still wouldn't have paid $200 for it
first of all it's not hollow second of
all it doesn't have any magical color
shifting properties and third of all
that's just a crazy amount of money to
spend on anything that's not from the
direct unicorn bloodline yeah you know
the one Clarence
2:30
best my boyfriend spent $70 on it but I
don't care it's pretty but this one it's
probably only worth the six dollars and
change I paid for it
and probably the original that I've
never seen - so in my professionally
unprofessional opinion
don't waste your 200 dollars buying the
original se starry starry night do you
know what you can buy with $200
I do 50 Starbucks laches groceries for a
month
one pretentious modern art print way to
go this guitar just kidding I don't use
it coz nails 40 sheets of nail vinyls
shouldn't have done that why do I always
feel inclined to throw my vitals
everywhere 14 men Sheba cat polishes 20
color Cup halo hues you could probably
pay yourself own bill for three whole
months oh your parents pay that for you
already
don't pick a macro lens for your camera
to make nail porn win adopt a cat and
get its first set of shots included and
if you already have a cat get a second
cat now guess what you can get for free
