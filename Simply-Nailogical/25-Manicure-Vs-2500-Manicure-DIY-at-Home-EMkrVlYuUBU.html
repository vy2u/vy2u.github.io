me christine again a couple of videos
ago you guys witnessed my friend Sofia
and I get a manicure at a fancy a salon
near La with the nail polish that was
supposedly valued at a hundred and
thirty thousand dollars for the manicure
itself I paid 2,500 American dollars
just making wise investment decisions
like youtubers do and when the comments
came rolling in there was a lot of
people who were suggesting that that was
a ridiculous amount of money to spend on
nail polish well yes I thought that was
pretty obvious I think most of us can
agree that spending that kind of money
on nail polish is not fiscally
responsible I mean you guys know I don't
really spend my money on much other than
Starbucks and Malo my money just kind of
sits there in a bank for my future fun
in any case I thought it would be fun
for my friend tonight to have a
ridiculously luxurious to lawn
experience has been like the opposite of
how I live my daily life what is bitch
and if you live your life anything like
I do then you'll be happy to hear that
today we're going to recreate the same
talking expensive twenty five hundred
dollar manicure right here at home for
twenty-five dad because I spent all my
disposable income and now on a budget
you will need a $10 gold shimmer nail
polish excuse all our black nail polish
and around person and dollars worth of
gold flakes first sadly we have to peel
off my hollow nail this is Eilers copper
hollow
it's so beautiful no
at least you're getting some sweet sweet
peel comforta clickbait stay for the
field warm
first off lifted on our trusty peel off
base coat so I can appeal it up and keep
it right here yes
my nails are yellow kind of orange if
you comment that down below we'll know
you're new here I'm just going to do the
one hand today because honestly I felt
so out of my element having both my
hands match it was a weird thing ever
and Plus how could I remove what's on my
other hand that's on tropical vibrant
neon orange polish it's a hollow taco on
tap because I don't play no game while
we wait for the peel off base coat to
dry why don't we have a look-see at the
comment section on my hundred and thirty
thousand dollar nail polish video on ah
I'm entering the hordes own first of all
I'm going to thank the many of you guys
for suggesting that I recreate the
looked at the salon did I think that's a
genius idea what do you know I'm filming
that video right now you guys definitely
picked up on how painful the mere
experience was of having someone else
touch my name I can't look you guys know
how long I've been growing back my nails
instead tragedy that we shall not speak
of nail growth video coming soon
ish but anyways yes honestly is very
difficult for me to have someone else
touch my nail the manicurist were such
great sports for putting up with me and
they were actually pretty funny I'd
collab with them again now that the peel
off base coat is dry let's start with
the accent nail you'll need a black
polish any cheap one will do I'm using
sinful colors black on black I got this
 at Walmart the $1.98
honestly it's on my favorite because
it's not opaque in one coat but it'll
work we just got to do two coats and now
for the gold shimmer polish it's shimmer
not glitter found this OPI one that
looks pretty much exactly the same as
the models own goal
nail polish good thing I saved my appeal
these for reference purposes see that
 pretty much exactly the same did
you guys catch the field porno on my
second channel huh so some good you
can find this OPI one for nine dollars
and change off Amazon it's name is boy
another polished joke
I guess they sick of my channel you
could also get the actual model zone
gold rush polish replica or maybe the
exact same as one hundred and
thirty thousand dollar version who knows
but you could get the discounted version
for about eight to nine dollars u.s.
excitedly no one will ship to
Canada so it couldn't get it in time
alright let's do our first coat now I'm
doing it the same way the salon did
which was not applying a color base coat
at all just putting the shimmer polish
directly on the nail how it looks the
same as my natural nail doesn't second
coat now we should really only do two
coats because that's what the salon did
they're probably trying to ration all
that gold in the Polish but I'm going to
do a third coat because this polish is
nine dollars back to the comment section
there were definitely some people who
seemed really upset by my video take
volve the redneck Slav - for example
anyone who would buy 130 thousand dollar
nail polish is on stupid retarded whore
Wow
who raised you involved the rednecks
love one or take Mike de Ridder here
mental health therapy is probably
something you should invest in after you
go bankrupt away he left two
comments goody
thank God I'm not the only one who saw
the first 10 seconds of this video and
was like ugly make up abusing
nail polish horse oh you noticed my
makeup oh I think what is it with boys
randomly calling women whores and
for no particular reason other than just
an attempt to insult them I'm pretty
sure these guys went to my high school
10 years ago and they're probably still
there I also saw some comments from you
guys
and some of you were tweeting at me that
four days after my video let's be posted
a video about getting an expensive salon
manicure at the same salon
that's a fee and I got our expensive
manicure let's see just jelly I stole
their girl you know what's funny the
thought process behind my a hundred and
thirty thousand dollar nail polish video
was literally to parody the types of
videos that BuzzFeed would make like the
worth it videos you know how they always
go drops thousands of dollars on
something and then ask if it was worth
it spoiler it's never worth it so it's
not really a surprise to me that at the
same time that I was making a video but
an expensive luxury salon experience
Lexie was also making a video about the
same concept I was making fun of the
type of video that buzzy would make and
then but she went made that video and
most importantly but she made sure to
let everyone know that they filmed their
video before I did that's right ladies
and gentlemen
BuzzFeed wants you to know they found
their video back in April I start hold
it so you would see it they did the
circling not me because you know it
would have been such a liability for
their giant company valued at 1.5
billion dollars for people to think that
I filmed it first the only thing I'm
left wondering is damn bucks eat why
does it take you like three and a half
months to edit a video that's rough do
you need some more employees because we
all left haha let's see the next video
I'm honestly just happy to hear that
BuzzFeed watches my video now for the
golden leave you can find jars of golden
flakes online for give or take thirteen
dollars now I went and bought the exact
same jar gold flakes that the salon has
because I realized oh that's the
same brand and everything and this
wasn't over thirty dollars but this is
totally not necessary because from what
I understand all this gold flake is
the same and it's usually cheaper if you
buy it in sheet form and then you can
rip it up yourself and if you don't want
to do any Rivage there's some smaller
portions of gold flakes you can get for
well under $13 so let's just say that
give or take you can get gold just for
30 notes because it's what added up to
25 dollars
okay we've meal score I can think of a
more fun way to get gold flakes I mean
that's pretty cool all right time to get
drunk memories University all right
psyche come on out we need to invest you
for our future well I caught some but it
definitely missed a lot more this is so
much harder than I thought it would be
never mind let's just stick to the dry
gold flakes they really do taste like
nothing so it's pretty easy to shred
this gold foil it's super delicate it
does tend to kind of stick together
up high get their gold damn it now we're
going to take our glassy taco slap it on
over the black polish
then we're going to work quickly to
place the gold little flaky want to
spread them out carefully so the whole
nail isn't covered in gold we don't want
to go too bougie
you know what I'm saying which isn't bad
and three and then with a late touch you
can just take your finger and gently
press the ghouls down and now we're
going to add a nice thick coat of glossy
top coat to seal in that $25 alright
friends what are we saying I think it
definitely looks a lot like the manicure
I got at the salon for $2,500 it looks
kind of expensive but you know what
would make it look even more and since
adding a hollow taco
there we go now my nails actually a few
people did ask me if I actually paid
$2,500 for the manicure at the salon yes
I did the salon did want to give it to
us for free but I insisted on paying for
at least the base price of the services
because otherwise I felt like it would
have been a conflict of interest
especially given the value of the
services sometimes when you accept a
free service especially one Valley that
high there can be underlying
expectations that you see positively
about the business because they're
giving you the services for free in
exchange for publicity we wanted to do
this as impartial E as we could for you
guys which in my view meant that it was
most fair if I paid for the services of
any paying customer would and I showed
you the receipts girl
and when I say receives I mean actual
receipts like bills with a transaction
with a set amount of money not a Twitter
tweet or damn you want to know the real
people BuzzFeed still has not shown
their receipts for maybe all of their
expensive videos are complimentary and
they never have to pay for anything and
it's all one giant understood
one last thing from the comments a lot
of people thought I got spammed
I mean spending thousands of dollars on
your nails that are just going to chip
up anyways will always be a scam in my
opinion but hey if a bitch wants to pay
for it a bitch wants to pay for it
however yes we were told that the nail
polish they use contains real actual
goals in the lacquer and the salon
didn't really give us the clearest
answer when we asked what was in it so
it made it golden there it has gold and
then there was a diamond cap which I
think probably would have accounted for
most of the hundred and thirty thousand
dollar value because diamonds however
some of you eagle-eyed people out there
pointed out that the cap was silver with
diamonds on top of it and not gold which
is what the cap looks like in the
pictures of the media articles written
about the original one hundred and
thirty thousand dollar models on gold
nail polish some of you also pointed out
that one day we're actually painting our
nails with the polish the cap was white
and not encrusted with diamonds and
that's because the diamond cap doesn't
have an actual nail polish brush on it
so they had to swap it out with a
regular cap just to do the painting at
least that's what we were told so after
this whole experience we decided to
reach out to models own to ask if the
oak Couture version of the gold polish
actually contained any real gold and if
it would make sense that a salon would
have the silver cap with diamonds rather
than a gold cap of diamond unfortunately
didn't answer in time for me to post
this video but they did say that someone
would get back to me on that but that
was over a week ago I don't want to get
sued okay so I'm not going to draw any
conclusion I'm going to let you draw
conclusions I do just want to say that I
really enjoyed filming that video so
much fun to go do that crazy pencil on
experience with Sophia I just wanted to
have fun with my friends and film and
over-the-top overpriced luxury
experience at the end of the day in what
world does someone agree that a fing
nail polish bottle is worth a hundred
and thirty thousand dollars or that a
manicure is worth two thousand and five
hundred dollars I think 99
of us would agree that that's increased
be fought online I got the chance to
make a crazy ass ridiculous video that I
normally would never make you guys got
entertained by it hopefully and we had a
good time my favorite part of the day
was that in and out so I don't have any
regrets but from now on I think I'll
stick to doing my own nails like this
video if you would make smarter
decisions with twenty five hundred
dollars in a youtuber would alright
everybody thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
