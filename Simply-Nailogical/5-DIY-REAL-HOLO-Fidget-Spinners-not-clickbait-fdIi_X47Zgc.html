spinning digits
oh my damn genius ugly I'm going to use
who are down your spiral well hello
everyone it's me Christine again I
cannot even begin to count the number of
comments from you but it's asking me to
make a video on hollow digit spitters
and you know what I try to give the
people what the people want so I googled
that and thought Paulo graphic
digit spinners could it be true is there
really such a thing do they make
holographic digit spinners so I bought a
whole bunch of them because I like to
time my money on practical things now
this one was advertised as holographic
let's see about that the is pretty
trippy fascinating but it's clearly just
a rainbow chrome which is still cool
don't get me wrong but the colors don't
actually shift in rainbows okay it's
like static rainbow with oh wait a
second what's on my other hand it's a
multi chrome polish with actually
holographic taco on top oh my god what's
on my other other and it's holographic
glitter in a rainbow of different colors
and if you're lucky I may actually post
this video of me doing nail art on this
channel alright what else did we get
last we got here feel like fidget
spinners are the new thousand-degree
knives of YouTube you know every second
channel is doing them even if they have
nothing to do with toys or fidgeting
Natasha we even put an actually
functional fidget spinner on her nails
what the
thank God I'm not skilled enough to even
attempt that oh my god I had a genius
idea
what if we attached a thousand degree
knives to the end of the fidgety 1000
degree death spinner trying to tell me
something weird about you little guy
what do you guys tell me what's that you
wish you are actually Hollow don't you
worry little fidget spinner friends you
to the right place what if we painted
these in real actual Hollow and they all
spun magical rainbows
we must investigate very important
research we do in this town I'm just
applying some glossy gel taco and then
I'm going to cure it and one of these
race alien machines I hope that one day
someone will find the cure for the
YouTube fidget spinner virus
all right now let's see well it hallo
I'm just buffing the powder on oh my god
quick we must do the whole thing take
that Amazon I think it might have lost
some of the spin power did I ruin it
let's plan those oops but it doesn't
matter cuz you know what it's like a
hundred times better looking how about
we paint this pink little spinner which
mentions hollow it go be more careful
this time to not get the Polish in the
center oh but be careful I wouldn't want
to steal my acetone all over me again
and now we're gonna - okay oh look at my
dog just make those boring black circles
more interesting by doing a hollow
gluten placement
now we're going to top it all off with
you guessed it a nice thick coat of
glassy taco all right ready for the
ultimate test it's like a hollow race
you spin me right round hollow right Wow
that's it I figured it out an actual
holographic spinner
you're welcome Internet what do you
think
okay now what now what come to think of
it I've painted a lot of things in
hollow polish my YouTube play button
some pumpkins look look at its beauty a
mother in car and now rigid spinners
that was a natural progression what will
she hollow next I don't know let's do
the dance look at my dog now to complete
the look and add some nice big pieces of
black hollow glitter because I really
liked how the pink one turned out I'm on
to something
okay let me lift you know what this
video is basically a nail art tutorial
but on a fidget Center and now add a
nice thick coat of glassy taco I think
I'm going to maintain its rainbow chrome
enos and just add a hollow taco over top
but sometimes you don't need to do
complicated mailer you just got out of
hollow taco
spending on trying to pin it how are
going to do West cause with glitter
burnishing technique you'll see a video
on that eventually you're just going to
cover up the middle part with some tape
and then I'm applying a gummy base coat
this one is yellow stopper base coat
then in about a minute or two it'll
become tacky and then you just buff in
the hollow glitter we're going to do
three different colors of Hallows
because one just it off it's looking a
little spark so I'm going to do a second
coat of glitter uh-oh I got a raccoon
beautiful now let's just add some gel
taco so that the glitter to the follow
I'm just gonna bake that all minute
I'm bored what do I do
denim yeah I didn't do the other side
okay leave me
all right once to have a spinoff ready
quick place your back in the comments
Rainbow hollows out like all the wit dog
like all the witches down she got
drowned movie away so you don't have her
with your opponent this is a nice white
noise while we're waiting uh you could
subscribe holy it looks like
they're all slowing down at the exact
same time
looks like rainbow chrome with hollow
taco is out okay you're done it's up to
you guys oh my god up also it's almost
exact same time this up but I'm pretty
sure green holo one here the replay yep
green holo one which is unfortunate
because I was really rooting for mentee
so in my research I also learned that
there are fidget spinner tricks so your
girl's going to try some today ready hey
let's see if we can go for three that
was almost a hot trick that again is
violent weapon and these are supposed to
be for children good logs you have to
use like the bottom of your finger know
what they do with with basketballs and
maybe if I just take my thumb off Oh
nope nope you almost broke her now well
no not even for YouTube video
I'm not risking breaking menace again
don't you remember the pain the
suffering
you don't want another video of me
crying do you swish swish fish is kind
of like an optical illusion you are
getting very hot a sexual reminds
me of those fans that I used to have
when I was like 12 years old we would
stick our fingers in it just for fun
I was a stupid child I just
realized that the insides of these and
what's the point of that Center within a
center a spin spin up or go to do some
of them up when I win as finis gonna
double sauce hollow sandwich please
what are you laughing at me vent
and don't you want to come sit with me
and come visit my spinner just I'll have
to play alone man bang nails me okay I'm
