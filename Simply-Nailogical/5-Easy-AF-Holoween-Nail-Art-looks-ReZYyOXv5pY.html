again and today we're gonna do some
Halloween nails as you can see I'm just
putting on a coat of clear nail polish
and there you have it natural organic
non-gmo candy corn nails
yeah it's that easy and QS and new
people why your nails so yellow they're
really dirty you should clean them or
stop smoking crack okay here we go today
I've got five easy as fall Halloween
nail art designs for you all with hollow
because if you haven't discovered it
yourself yet you're probably hollow
sexual these are all easy because I did
them with nail vinyls which requires
very little painting abilities or skills
but hollow look at these nail vinyls I
found them on the Internet's of course
all great things come from the internet
and I put the link to where I got them
down below in the video description box
they also come in different shapes and
designs and so it's not just
Halloween stuff let's start off with my
middle nail because I like giving the
finger first a nice one coat of my
favorite black nail polish have you seen
my what's the best black nail polish
video yet then you got a stick on some
protector stuff around your skin because
Halloween is one of those holidays where
kids get a little rowdy you know what
I'm saying let's do a quickie gradient
so we can get right to the hollow vinyls
so that purple dab dab dab it on the
nail just the tip this time I'm doing it
on just the tip peel off your layer of
protection oops there was a little
seepage but we got Plan B it's called to
clean our brush and add a nice thick
coat of glossy taco to make everything
nice and smooth next you're gonna peel
up these hollow spiderweb vinyls
actually wouldn't mind if I was caught
in a hollow web I'd probably really
enjoy it press it on the nail and oh my
what's that on my other hand it's a
beautiful dirt but still quite bright
purple linear Hollow this purple is soap
reminds me of the sash on a witch's hat
for Barney a friendly purple dinosaur
one or the other make sure that web of
holo is fully pressed down on your nail
and take some tiny magical scissors and
cut around the edges to take off the
excess top it all off with a nice thick
coat of glossy taco like a really really
thick coat you want it to seep into the
little holes of the web so you can catch
boys in it later you cat dress like a
slot now I know what you're really up to
this Halloween don't lie to me
now let's move on to the pinky finger
which ended up being my favorite design
of them all starting off with some
linear red hollow dipping a tiny
painting brush in some black acrylic
paint and I'm essentially painting the
whole of a really big melon mouth that
is open very very wide like mine when I
am presented with chocolate candies now
painting some fangs with some white
acrylic paint fill in all the little
tiny teeth and this nail is ready to
suck a bitch's blood except it's missing
something what could it be
hollow teeth obviously so I
grabbed this little hollow devil guy
performed a quick surgery on his horns
and turned them into fangs Hannah
lopsided but whatever I made it work I'm
kind of regretting not doing all of my
nails like this because I think this is
badass as rock on my necks now I had the
brilliant idea of having a drunk ghost
lost in a sea of hollow I used the same
watered-down acrylic paint technique as
I did in my rainbow smoked nails video a
while ago I thought it would look cool
if I made it into a screaming ghost with
a hollow bat and kind of green but it
didn't didn't really have the full
hollow BAM effect I was going for so I
was like that stopped overcomplicating
things christine just keep it simple
they say trying out something new now
with a blue hollow background and I'm
gonna do a gradient with some more
hollows because I can keep things simple
dab dab dab on the nail peel it off and
that is a beautiful sky
now let's make it spooky with these
graveyard vinyl things Oh obviously I
peeled up the one that wasn't on camera
good job Kristine good job me I'm
sticking the graveyard vinyls at the
base of the nail and choppy choppy don't
cut your
can we don't want real blood in this
Halloween video some of the shapes are
so small that they're tough to peel off
so it helps to fold the vinyl sheet like
this
let's stick on a moon and a mat because
I don't know those are things that go in
the sky seal it all off with a nice
thick coat of glossy taco now let's move
on to the next nail starting off with
the scattered orange hollow polish I'm
going to turn it into a pumpkin I'm
using the eyes and the mouth of the
pumpkin as the little hollow pieces on
this now the eyes came out a little
crooked but what can you do now I'm
using some black polish to trace around
the pumpkin so that the pumpkin looks
like it's orange and the background
looks like it's black it's like painting
a pumpkin in Reverse kind of a mindfuck
that's why it doesn't look too good I
also added a nose black was missing
something obviously with a hollow
topcoat so I added that and then I put
on a final glossy taco to make
everything all smooth now what do we do
on my thumb no one really cares because
you don't see it much in pictures these
hollow hands or creepiest so let's try
those I just quickly stuck them on over
top of a green hollow polish combo and
now you're ready to slay the knight to
terrorize all the little children to
steal their candy to dress like a
and get really wasted even though you
have exams the next morning on November
1st what Christine this is not about
what I did this is about what you're
gonna do by the way none of those
pictures are me Halloween may be pretty
close to when you're seeing this video
but hey okay I tried to get this up
early but you could check the website I
link down below to see if you could ship
the vinyls just in time for you to wear
them on Halloween and don't let people
shame you for not being a real nail
artist because you're using male vinyls
it's all in art that we put on our nails
and you should be proud of it and hey it
took you like 1/8 of the time that it
took a freehand painter to to it so who
really wins also yours are hollow so
beat that bitch also please subscribe to
my channel because I often forget to ask
people to do that and you're supposed to
ask people to do that in order to be a
good youtuber so thanks for subscribing
alright guys thanks so much for watching
then I'll see y'all later Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
