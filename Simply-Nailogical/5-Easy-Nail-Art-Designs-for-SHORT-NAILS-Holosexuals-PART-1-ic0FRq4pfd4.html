again and I actually have nail art
designs for you in today's video for
once can we just take a look at my
recent posting history for a second like
what am I even doing you thought this
was a nail art channel well you thought
wrong I don't know what it is though
speaking of this channel we hit two
million holo sexuals I'm gonna cry in
hollow tears of course yes I am planning
a massive giveaway to celebrate two
million holo sexuals but it's been like
two seconds since my 1 million giveaway
so I'm gonna need more time for now I'll
just say a big thank you to everyone
from the bottom of my hollow heart ok
nails yay nail art yes whoo I remember
how to do this we will see so if you're
new here my nails used to be long and
then I broke one and then I cried and
then we had a funeral and it was all
very very traumatic reluctantly I filed
down all my long nails to match my short
nail whoo time-lapse filing does this
make you cringe watching so much filing
sheddings look at all that cocaine and
here are my new shorties well not new I
filmed this exactly a month ago in case
you're new here and wondering yes my
nails are very yellow and no I'm not a
crack addict I was a joke before about
the cocaine case you didn't get it and
now it's time to do five potentially
easy nail designs for short nail hollow
sexuals let's start off with the pinky
because I find it most boring just
applying a bluish purplish multi chrome
polish as the base color first as always
I try to put a list of all the polishes
and stuff I'm using in my videos down
below in the video description box
take some dotting tools minor dirty but
you should clean yours put some holo on
a yogurt lid or a nail art mat whatever
you prefer and just start dotting dots
on it as you can see here I'm trying to
make an X shaped pattern now I'm just
taking some silver Hollow and adding
more dots really though the point of
this video is to show you that you can
do somewhat intricate designs on short
nails and now it kind of looks like a
pink X with some silver dots around the
pink X here's a pro nail tip for you
smaller your nails are the smaller you
should make the dots so that you can fit
them all and that's that what a
beautiful original design I'm just gonna
add a quick dry glossy top coat on top
of that and we'll move on to the next
one for my next nail it's the one that
broke on me you trade are you traitor
I'm gonna start off with a nice creamy
white base coat and then obviously we're
gonna put Hollow on top of that but for
now just what now add a quick dry top
coat because we're gonna add now
I mean striping tape next only the
original hollow sexuals know what I was
about to say but didn't after that's dry
and you've sung a Melanie Martinez song
grab some striping tape preferably
hollow because it's just soothing I
could peel this roll forever cut up some
short pieces of the striping tape and
stick it on a top of a nail polish
bottle cap and now we're going to use a
trick that models use because your nails
are like models they slay we're going to
do the vertical thinning stripe trick by
adding a bunch of striping tape down the
nail in this direction this will give
the illusion that your nails are longer
than they actually are shout out to all
the members of the nub Club make sure
the striping tape is pressed down
securely and what's on my other hand
it's a beautiful blue dark blue navy
blue hollow that I may have mentioned
before and another what's on my other
hand but I can't remember now finally
let's add some purple hollow this time
on top of the striping tape make sure to
put on a thick enough coat so that the
hollow is perfectly opaque and don't
forget to work quickly do not let the
nail polish dry start peeling up the
striping tape immediately or else it's
gonna get all crusty and nasty and uh
feel off base coat problems yes I am
wearing a peel-off base coat I always do
but I don't recommend using one if
you're gonna be working with striping
tape or nail vinyls because then it'll
just peel everything why am I using one
I don't know don't listen to me don't do
as I do add a nice thick layer of glossy
taco and may
sure not to push down too much or else
you're gonna make all the colors bleed
beautiful my nail just lost ten pounds
for the next nail we're gonna do a
glitter placement and I'm starting off
with a nice one coder black opaque
polish remember last time when I did a
what's the best black polish yeah well I
like because that's not the polish I'm
used to make just kidding I didn't lie
because this polish isn't available at
the drugstore you can only get it online
I put the link down below if you want oh
let's play with some hollow glitter
though yeah yeah look at black hollow
glitter all it's my soul this is what I
will look like when I am cremated then
you're gonna take some clear polish not
topcoat or tacos because they dry too
fast add just a bit of clear polish on
the nail because we're gonna work in
small sections at a time
pick up some loose hollow glitter by
licking the tip of a toothpick I'm not
going to make the same joke guys I've
made that joke like 802 times and you're
gonna spend about an hour placing every
single individual glitter onto your nail
I may have said these designs are easy
but I didn't say they aren't
time-consuming you don't have to cover
your entire nail and loose glitter if
you don't want to but it's a great idea
for an accent nail and the shorter your
nails are the less time you have to
spend covering your nail and glitter nub
Club bonus and I've invited the ghosts
back to complete the look Thank You
ghosts
I love your work ghosts yes you are
doing quite well if your glitters are
looking a little cloudy not to worry
you're gonna add a nice thick coat of
glossy taco and that'll bring your
glitters back to Hollow Ville it's like
Whoville but hollow Ville so way better
for the next now I'm committing a sin of
the hollow sexual Kingdom and mixing
hollow with creme polish horror horror
let's start off with one coat of teal
hollow I love this color
I'm like obsessed with this color right
now has anyone seen my snapchat add some
liquid latex around your nail to protect
it because we're gonna do a gradient
next well my god it's been so long
normally I wouldn't recommend doing a
gradient with a creme and a holo because
they are different finishes and they
don't really like to blend too well but
I'm feeling rebellious today and I'm
to put those kids in the same playground
and force them to get along then you
just gonna dab dab dab right on the nail
this whole video is like a throwback of
my stupid sakes
now you're gonna repeat that let me just
give you a heads up and let you know
that right now we're creating a scaled
gradient now that's a design I came up
with about two years ago and it was my
very first video on YouTube all the
memories I've done it on short nails
before because I wanted to show you guys
that a scaled gradient can in fact be
done on short nails but I'm doing it
again now because I can okay and now
you're just gonna peel off simply peel
like no big deal yeah love me some peel
porn then you got to pick out any little
Krusty's that got left behind I love
cleaning up my cuticles so there's
something so satisfying about it then
you're gonna add a glossy taco because
we're gonna actually add nail vinyls
next let it dry for at least 15 to 20
minutes depending on how good your
glossy taco is don't eat it though I'm
just gonna grab myself a single Chevron
nail vinyl hooded on the nail because
basically we're masking off the lower
gradient area of the nail so that we can
make a second gradient on the upper
portion of the nail I called it a scaled
gradient because it kind of looked like
reptile scales at least because the
first one I did was green and then let's
get to Dabin but careful Javon this time
you're only working with a tiny section
of the nail and it may be tinier
depending on how short your nails are so
you got to work with the ultimate level
of precision and make sure that you're
just not blending all the colors
together still need to see a gradient
that's the idea
honestly the scaled gradient technique
does take some practice I'm not going to
lie on short nails it is a little bit
trickier but a double skill gradient
like this one can definitely be done on
any size nail maybe you just don't
attempt the triple or the quadruple when
you're happy with the blending you're
going
peel off simply peel again like no big
deal remove the nail vinyl immediately
as well don't let that dry clean up
if you need to and bam that looks pretty
cool donut final glossy tacho for the
wind and moving on to the final design
we're gonna do the ugliest one maybe I
cared less because it was on my thumb
and thumbs just look weird on camera
don't they like what is this stamping
yeah sure let's do that this is a cool
play put the link below if you want it
add some black stamping polish scrape
that down put the sticky Stamper on
it and look at that wow I'm actually
good at this why why do I not do this
often I don't know instead of putting it
directly on the nail we're gonna do
something called reverse stamping
because I'm feeling very ambitious right
now basically you just fill in the tiny
little sections of the stamp with
different colors and I think really
intricate tiny designs like this one are
perfect for short nails because you're
gonna get a lot of design on a small
surface area where's the hollow where's
the hollow here it is don't worry guys
doot-doot-doot to do more colors and
random places when you're done color and
get in like a coloring book your going
to take a clear nail polish and paint it
over the entire stamp now I do clear
nail polish instead of taco because a
taco makes it too hard like a crispy
shell you know let that dry for
like 20 or 30 minutes and then peel it
up and now we have ourselves a DIY
deagle deagle deagle deagle I'm just
gonna keep repeating that for all people
who don't like it to stick it on your
nail just add a quick coat of clear
polish or topcoat whatever and press it
right down I mean it kind of looks
better in my head and I don't know what
you want me to say I'm not the best at
free-handing I'm just showing you that
you could do this if you were better at
this and you have short nails and also
struggling at cutting off the excess I
have no idea how Sveta does it so
perfectly one day I should kidnap her
for real okay now clean that up add
a final glossy taco to seal it all in
and give a big thumbs up to this video
for how good I just did and there we
have it
five nail art design ideas for short
nailed hull sexuals of course feel free
to substitute any colors with the hollow
of your preference
speaking of hollow sexual did you buy my
shirt yet I showed up my hollow shirts
in my last video and you guys are just
loving them they are only available for
a limited edition campaign so make sure
you get yours before the campaign ends
amid you're mad at me and that way when
you're out in public it'll be way easier
to spot another fellow homosexual and
you know what we say I'm like hey what's
up hollow drop my hollow glitter right
on to the log I just wanna play got
hollow for us to code married to the
hollow introducing my pillow I'll stop
there I call that the hollow lap all
right guys thank you so much for
watching stay tuned for a part two for
short nail designs and I'll see y'all
next time bye
