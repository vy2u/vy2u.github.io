again and today is the day where I live
up to a promise that I made almost a
month ago last month I gave you some
ideas for short nailed hollow sexuals
part 1 but at the same time when I
filmed them I also filmed around - so
it's your lucky day especially for those
who have yet to discover their hollow
sexuality so why don't you grab a snack
mix yourself Shirley Temple subscribe to
my channel before you forget and maybe
grab some holo and paint your nails
while you settle in for five potentially
easy panel art designs for short nails
hollow sexuals if you're really new here
and you don't know what the hell I've
been saying so far hollow means
holographic it just means rainbows that
shift different colors and different
lights it is love it is life move
breathe hollow okay so brief backstory a
while ago I broke my nail in a tragic
org place accident then I was forced to
file them down and make them all the
same size but that's okay no worries
short nail people can have equally
amazing nail arts as long the old people
it's all about equality first step let's
do this really easy heart cyclone design
with a nice pink color glitter
underneath yes that baby pink hollow
glitter is my cat's nail polish
shameless Kitty self-promotion right now
I'm just sponging on the hollow glitter
with a makeup sponge to make it more
opaque when I'm done I add a nice thick
coat of quick dry glossy taco that's top
coat for those who don't speak simply
now logical ish yet and let it dry for a
good 15 to 20 minutes because we're
going to add now vinyls next one of the
easiest ways to do nail art for long or
short nails is to use nail vinyls like
these I'm using some super cute mini
hearts cyclone vinyls I put the link
below in the video description box and
they actually come in two different
sizes so I'm using the slightly smaller
size because I have smaller nails right
now you can do the same thing with my
cat head
when she made those two star vinyls also
come in different sizes as do
circular-shaped cyclone vinyls there are
so many possibilities of nail vinyls
honestly like why bother free-handing
with these great inventions so all you
got to do is press it firmly down on the
nail and then paint on your second color
the number one question I get when I'm
doing this
is are you supposed to let the nail
polish dry before you peel up the bun
and the answer is oh god no do not let
that happen in order to get a clean
fresh edge of the design you gotta peel
up the vinyl well the nail polish is
still wet so don't waste any time after
painting on the nail polish peel up that
 right away and protip the cyclone
vinyls are my favorite ones to peel off
add a glossy taco to seal everything in
and also smooth out the different layers
of nail polish you got going on and
there you go beautiful Hollow has my
heart how fitting the next design is
super easy it does not involve nail
vinyls and it's called the waterfall
design I'm starting off with one coat of
my current favorite black creme polish
it's a one coat wonder it is amazing I
put the link below for this polish as
well as every other polish I'm using in
this video down below in the video
description box so basically for this
design you just take a bunch of
different random assorted colors that
you think look good together I'm putting
mine on a yogurt lid take a very thin
striping nail art brush and then you're
going to start striping each color one
by one in very thin lines starting at
the cuticle and just bleeding a little
bit up so that way it kind of looks like
waterfall and I'm pretty sure that the
waterfall concept and name was coined by
the Nayla source
she's a nail art blogger maybe three or
four years ago or maybe more I'm not
sure you can go back and brighten up
some of the colors if you feel like you
need to and for anyone asking I clean my
brushes in between each color using
straight acetone and then I rinse it off
with water well that's a lie I don't
always rinse it off with water I'm lazy
but you should yeah you should do it
properly the next design is one of my
personal favorites because it's so
simple to do but it looks cool as fall
some of my super longtime hollow sexuals
and they recognized
design from almost a year and a half ago
first I'm just applying a white creme
polish to use as a base color you could
use any color for any of these designs
of course substitute as you wish next
I'm adding a quick dry glossy taco which
is key because we're gonna let that dry
and we're gonna add new vinyls next yeah
so much nostalgia in this video next
we're gonna use some long pointy
triangle nail vinyls and the shape of
these does matter you can't just use
stripe nail vinyls you'll see why if you
put down three beside each other and
then pull out the middle one push them
down so they're stuck firmly on the nail
you've got three triangles that are the
exact same size take whatever color
hollow you want it's got to be hollow am
i right fill in the middle triangle and
the spots around the side of the nail
peel off those vinyls right away don't
waste time now peel them right away
whoopsie how did that happen no worry
cleanup brush with a tiny bit of acetone
to the rescue and on the sides of my
nail because yes I was hard to put nail
polish there and not get it in your
cuticle okay now you're going to add
another glossy taco on top of this
because we got to let this dry and put
nail vinyls on again now we're taking
the exact same size and shape triangle
nail vinyls putting them on top of the
white spots oh there's a men she hair
press them down firmly on the nail
because now we're gonna sponge on some
iridescent color shifting unicorn skin
flakies this is why unicorns have gone
extinct okay because we skinned them all
in the name of nail polish so I'm using
a makeup sponge just like I did with the
glitter to sponge on the flicky so that
I get more flakies on top of my nail
polish give me all the skins I want all
of Charlie's skins when you're done peel
off the nail vinyls for the last time
push over any flakies if you need to and
that's it add a nice thick coat of
glossy taco again to seal it all in and
damn a nails look fangirl next up we're
gonna do a cute little peekaboo hollow
glitter but with a flag kind of symbol
on it I don't know what country's flag
is this I'm jealous we're using one of
my favorite aqua blue holographic
glitter polishes putting on a sponge to
get the most out of it yeah sponging it
on my pinky for maximum glitter payoff
then I'm gonna add a quick dry glossy
taco let dry because
can't can you guess what I'm gonna do
next let me hear you say it out loud
you set it in your head didn't you I'm
just using some skinny striped nail
vinyls to kind of make an X pattern or a
plus sign depends on how you look at it
and I'm using some creme polishes to
fill in opposing sides of whatever
pattern this is because I don't know I
thought the contrast of creme versus
hollow with cool peel up the nail vinyls
well the nail polish is still wet and do
any cleanup if necessary then seal it
and finish it off with another glossy
taco and you're done and last but not
least well maybe least I don't know if I
really like this do you guys like this
is a distressed holographic foil look on
my thumbnail no not my YouTube thumbnail
by actual thumbnail I started off with a
base of aqua teal linear holo it is my
life I want to go swimming in it and
then I got some really cool rainbow
holographic foil so we're gonna play
with that get any foil glue though if
you want to start playing with nail
foils you can usually buy it at the same
place that you get the nail foils I put
a link down below for both of those
using just a little bit of foil glue on
the brush I'm doing kind of a distressed
dry brushing pattern you only need to
let it dry for maybe a minute don't let
it wait too long it just needs to be a
bit tacky then press the foil directly
on top of the nail and lift it up
quickly and you can do it multiple times
on different spots of the nail to get
kind of a more distressed look going on
the only downside though to using
metallic foils is that you can't put a
quick dry glossy taco on top so I have
to use a water-based topcoat on top of
this which are much harder to come by
which aren't is shiny and which
definitely do not dry as quick and there
we have it five pretty damn awesome if I
do say so myself
nail art design ideas for short nails
hollow sexuals I definitely love seeing
your guys's recreation so if you do one
of these designs don't forget to tag me
on Twitter so I can see or if you're
more of an Instagram kind of person and
you make video tutorials on there you
can use my Instagram feature account
hash tag that's simply not logical
because I go through those hashtags and
share other people's awesome videos I
know my nails may not be that short for
the definition of short nails but I
really feel these designs can be done on
any
length including shorter than mine are
currently in this video whoa guys are
you seeing that you've seen the hollow
foil reflection in my eyes I mean my
nails I mean what alright guys if you're
new here and you're really liking the
hollow you're seeing on this channel so
far then you should subscribe right now
and join the Hollow sexual Kingdom I
also have a very special announcement in
next week's video but it's going to take
me about a week to get it up so please
be patient and with that said thanks so
