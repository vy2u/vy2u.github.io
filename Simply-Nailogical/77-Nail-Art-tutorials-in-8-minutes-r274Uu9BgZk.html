would it be and today I'm gonna set the
world record for the greatest number of
nail art tutorials in eight minutes
many have tried to do this before me but
no one has succeeded just kidding no one
has tried that's stupid
but in the spirit of the new year let's
take a look back at all the hours of my
life I spent painting my nails i
hand-picked some of my favorites just
for you let's begin
ah yes my very first youtube video
tutorial and the very first girls
gradient in the world ever I'm pretty
sure I filmed this like three times
because I kept messing it up for the
camera oh look it's the same thing
basically
but it's brown good job Christine you
know how to use different colors Wow my
heading was pretty terrible last year
wasn't it there's like a thousand frames
per second in this video so confusing I
don't even know what's happening now
here's my first time trying to conquer
the triple scale gradient
why are you doing that you should put
the top coat on the whole nail first uh
hugs so messy and this is the top nail
art skill of 2002 any year because
everyone needs to know that it's the
best way to apply glitter to your nail
is to sponge it on now if only I had
simply peel back then notice how I keep
changing the size and font of my
subtitle yeah that's really annoying I
realized how much of that cleanup part
that I cut out of my videos because it
was really embarrassing that I had to
spend like an hour cleaning up my finger
and if I told people that then they
wouldn't want to try the nail art what's
this I'm not using a sponge to apply
nail polish wow this was first well
that's pretty good Christine what are
those freehand skills you've been hiding
from me I mean myself where is the
pattern I cannot see it look how not
yellow my nails are wow I was such a
baby fetus back then with no experience
um that was the most boring glitter
gradient ever basically take as many
pieces of striping tape as you can put
them on your nail and try to make a
pattern more gradients and tape yay
I have an idea let's play a game every
time you see me do a gradient in this
video take a shot and if I clean it up
the hard way with tape and acetone then
take two shots because you must feel
really bad for me oh look tape and
gradients drink up kids hey what the
hell was I thinking I can't even see the
design that time I tried to start a male
trend that didn't turn into a trend I
called this he thought sponging because
it's a sea foam or something like that
I don't know from the ocean maybe back
to doing the only thing that people
wanted to see from me also take another
shot can we just pay attention for a
second at how I had no idea how to
actually apply nail polish but just
cover it with rainbow and tape and
acetone have a drink and everything is
good I wonder if anyone ever read my
subtitles if they did the part like
returning reciprocal Chevron gradient
are you on crack I'm never watching your
videos bye or what about this one
starburst scaled gradient hollow skittle
like what I don't see any skittle luck
clouds how boring and who is painting
that dandelion on my nail I must have
hired a tiny leprechaun take a drink you
are getting really drunk right now
oh look some proof that I can tape my
opposite hand I never showed it much
because yeah I have it Zima on that hand
as you can see but honestly nowadays I
don't pay my opposite hand because who's
got time for that Tommy I just do nail
art on one hand like a normal person
have a look at those shitty rhinestones
I picked up with a dotting tool
Christine you know so much better now
with your crystal katana okay if you're
not already drunk
this single tutorial will get you wasted
cuz look how many gradients I had to do
my very first could Drupal scaled
gradient and I am so proud of you baby
Christine oh look one of the very first
sightings of simply nail porn just the
beginning now this is what happens when
you're a hollow polish addict and you no
longer have the ability to see if a
design makes sense what is this how to
clean your cuticles oh this should be
good
more gradient mind also drink again
because that cleanup was a mystery I
liked these nails but then someone
commented what
happens when you touch your period and I
never liked them again this was a big
hit back when I did it but then I redid
it recently with a voiceover because it
made no sense to anyone some people
thought this looks 3d or like whipped
cream or like toothpaste
it's glue Christine you're dumb and then
I broke my nail moment of silence please
I wrote a blog post on how I grew my
nails back I put the link below in the
video description box so one of these
days I should probably make a video on
that shouldn't I but short nails weren't
gonna stop me from doing nail art
because you can do nail art on any nail
like sometimes people ask me can you do
nail art for short nails and I just
think like you can do any nail art that
I do on short nails but just don't do
them on long nails do the money short
nails that's all it's really not that
complicated I don't understand see look
I'm even doing a scale gradient on a
very short nail look see everything is
possible and you believe in magic or
hollow or some hollow dots look how many
dots I can fit on my short nail wow it's
amazing here's some hollow glitter plaid
short nails for the preppy bitch and all
of us ooh
multi chrome porn my first time trying
the twinkle teeth cyclone nail vinyls
they are so much fun to peel I love them
stare at my nails and blink 27 times
what do you see now
hey bro why'd you give me a pepperoni
pizza I ordered Hawaiian wow I never
realized how emo this design was finally
I have discovered simply peel and
history is made forever
we add these nails so this company sent
me this barf tastic creamy glitter is
all I could come up with was this ice
cream look that I would never eat blob a
cure these are so much fun if you have a
lot of patience because truth be told I
probably did this like eight times and
then of course totally mislead you with
that subtitle look at that flaky bubble
pop I remember kids on Instagram used to
be like why do you show the close up of
the nail polish that is so stupid I mean
clearly you are too young too
she ate nail porn right now that time I
did nail art that I thought was rainbow
and black chevrons but everyone said oh
my God look it's Liam's tattoo that time
I did some not-so-subtle product
placement simply feel is finally in full
force and so our Twinkle teen nail
vinyls is when I finally started to
discover my inner self and then I lost
my sense of self concept when I
attempted water marbling for the first
time don't worry I dusted my shoulders
with hollow glitter and continued on the
path of greatness Oh Canada it's time we
change our Flair do gradients and hollow
perfect for a homosexual land oh and
there's that time I did gay pride nails
in celebration of America passing their
new marriage laws and then I got
attacked by a bunch of angry homophobic
Americans so naturally I did more
rainbow pride nails stuff I really like
making out long comfortable gives me a
sick form of pleasure hey that's my face
that's the effect I was going for did
you know that I am a mermaid and I did
these acrylic watercolor nails to prove
it not all my nails were perfect in 2015
okay I did lots of nail fails along the
way that time my nails were a huge slut
and hoarded up with some flickies and
fishnet and then you followed me on some
adventures and attempt to build that
nail polish show that no one cares what
you look we can't all be fabulous oh
shit hey guys look he's never on fire
that time I tried to do Russian nail art
but not even dr. oz could help me oh
look it's my face again this time
talking about the history of unicorn
teeth that face to clean no one watch
please go watch this video it's sad that
time I joined the Swarovski biker gang
and here's that time I did the messiest
nail art ever and I probably also have
the record for top number of sexual
innuendos in a nail art tutorial that
time I gave in to peer pressure and just
had to try those ugly bubble nails from
myself and then it was time for the
roast of the bubble nails you should
probably go to the doctor nails look
like my grandma's knuckles Lodge so much
blood
olive litter blood everywhere then I
filled it up spinning in Passau that
time a bunch of people who don't have a
sense of humor told me I was disgusting
for putting my cat hair on my nails my
cat enjoyed it I enjoyed it
what's the problem then I discovered
unicorn skins in history was made
forever
remember when I ruined my nails 32 times
to do the scientific test for you guys
yeah my nails still hates you for that
since everyone loved how not to water
marble I then made a video on how not to
stamp which wasn't too hard to do
because I totally sucked at it hello
it's me
I was 1 no words there are no words that
time I did Star Wars nail art without
having ever seen a Star Wars movie and a
bunch of people got offended when I
called Chewbacca hairy monkey and of
course he couldn't finish off the year
without doing yet another up the finger
nail art design that no one is ever
going to replicate ever this one was
inspired by glam and gore and I'm so
proud to say that this year I actually
started watching makeup channels on
YouTube what can I say I'm expanding my
horizons well that's it for this year
