you're new then there's a first hallo
for every time what so in my last video
I told you that I wore these rainbow
youtube nails for 11 days except I lied
I ended up wearing them for 13 days and
I could have worn them for longer but it
was time for a change can't have too
much of a good rainbow thing now you
guys wanted to know how the hell I kept
these on for 13 entire days without any
chipping what a great question let's
answer it this is how to make your many
last if you're not already subscribed
quick click subscribe before the intro
card ends go now before I let you in on
my eight tips and tricks to make my
manicure last we got to talk about one
thing by chemistry chemistry section
things are getting weird already
basically it means that everybody's
nails may react differently to nail
polish your nails may be oily or thinner
or porous Regehr or brittle ear are
those words the nail bed may be super
curved or super flat and a whole bunch
of other body based variables that may
affect how long your manicure will
actually last on your nails because
everyone is different okay let's just
shut up with all the exceptions and
caveats and get right into my 8
different tips to help make your mani
last first things first you got a clean
bitch I know I hate cleaning things to
make sure you have zero nail polish on
your nails sounds obvious that I have to
say it any gutter removed the cuticle
sounds like surgery but I assure you it
is quite simple now it's really hard for
me to show you this exactly on my nails
because I basically have no cuticles
some people's cuticles can write up as
far as up to here on their nails this is
my boyfriend Ben's nail and he has some
flaky ass cuticles that would need to be
removed if he wanted his manicure to
last one thing I should point out that's
not always obvious is the cue
Cole is not actually your skin so you
don't want to take off your skin that
would be actual surgery you just want to
take off the tiny little dead bits of
skin that ride up on your nail because
if you leave them there the nail polish
won't stick to them and your mani will
start peeling off faster to do that you
just buy some cuticle remover liquid or
gel they're pretty widely available and
inexpensive put a little bit down on
your cuticle take a cuticle pusher I
recommend either an orange stick or a
wooden stick they're the same thing they
just have different names or a hard
rubber / silicone stick it's a little
flexible and only use a metal tool if
you have extremely stubborn cuticles
that ride way up your nail most people
won't eat a metal tool so after a minute
or so you're going to take your cuticle
pusher and gently push your cuticles
back and scrape any dead cuticle off the
surface of your nail gentle pushing is
okay scraping is okay cutting is not
okay not that I'm a qualified nail
technician or anything but for most
people watching this video it's probably
safe to say you should never cut your
cuticle area unless you want to end up
with a bloody hack job but that's a
whole other video so wipe that cuticle
 off and let's move on also wash
your nails because the blue stuff eats
your skin Oh scary
next you basically need to dehydrate
your nails like in the desert
not really but same idea you can do that
by taking rubbing alcohol
nail polish remover or acetone and just
wiping it on the top of your nail plate
you do this because nail polish won't
stick to oil on your nails but what is
that beautiful gorgeous red hollow on my
other hand Scarlett Johansson is that
you this super bright red holographic
polish is like the classic red lipstick
but of nail polish and also hollow so
way better and we are back from the
Oscars don't forget to clean the
underside of your nail as well don't let
that dirt get up in there the second
must-have tip to a long-lasting manicure
is a good base coat that means not a
peel off base coat if you're used to my
videos I put the link for the base coat
that I like to use when I want my
manicure to last down below in the video
description box but basically you want
to look for a base coat that says it's
long-lasting or sticky or has color
bonding properties and always ladies
wrap the tip of the nail for extra
protection now make sure your base coat
is fully dry before moving on to the
next step now let's apply the first coat
of nail polish work in thin coats and
don't put too much polish on the brush
at once
what is this royal navy blue linear
hollow so deep it's like the starry
night sky now I'm applying this blue
hollow just as an example for you guys
to see but I use the same basic tips and
tricks' when I did my youtube rainbow
nails to make them last
oops I got it on my skin not to worry
we'll clean it up don't forget to wrap
the tip again always wrap the tip and
this is why see how there's still nail
polish on the tips of my nails 13 days
later except for that one but no one's
perfect
having the tips of your nails fully
wrapped and all the layers of your
manicure will help prevent chipping by
like 100% now if the free edge of your
nail is shorter than your actual finger
I under
stand this is a little trickier well
what you could do is try and wrap the
tips anyways and then just take a
cleanup brush to get it off your skin
more on the cleanup brush in a set the
next important tip is to clean up any
nail polish messes that you make before
they dry well this was still wet I just
use a wooden stick to get most of it off
and then you can take what nail artists
like to call a cleanup brush which can
either be an actual cleanup brush made
by nail companies or a makeup eyeliner
brush or concealer brush I personally
prefer using clean up brushes made by
actual nail companies because they are
designed to hold up to acetone then to
clean up any leftover mess you just take
your cleanup brush dip it in some
acetone and rub it gently on your skin
remember this is a lot easier to do
while the nail polish is still kind of
wet now could you use nail polish
remover instead of acetone sure you
could it's just not as effective so I
personally prefer acetone to do this
also something you should be doing while
cleaning up your nails is making sure
the part around the cuticle line is nice
and even you do this for two main
reasons firstly it just looks better and
secondly it is important to leave a
little bit of a gap there because you
don't want the nail polish to be too
close to your skin or else it might peel
up easier if you ever wondered why the
hell nail bloggers leave a little gap
there that's why next proceed with your
second coat of polish as required or
necessary don't forget to wrap the tip
one more time and if you have any
mess-ups or painting out of the line
clean up one more time next we're going
to steal your manicure in which is just
as important as the base coat step for
the most long lasting manicure I
recommend using a glossy top coat you
could use a matte top coat but they
generally don't last that long
I find the brand and quality of the top
coat can really affect how long your
manicure will stay on so you can check
out the one I use at the link below but
equally as important is how you apply
the tacca or the top coat for all the
new people here who don't speak simply
no logical ish yet with every topcoat
stroke you apply make sure you receive
it passed the colored part of the nail
polish just towards the cuticle but not
actually touching your skin this is also
why I like to leave somewhat of a larger
gap between the nail polish and the skin
so you have the space to roll back your
topcoat into I do this because it
creates a really strong seal around your
nail polish and makes it way less likely
to start chipping up around the cuticle
you locked-in mother lacked finally
don't forget to wrap the tip of your
nail polish again the last time and you
should have been doing all this while
the topcoat was still wet don't pause
and stare at your nails in between the
underside of your nail should look
something like this after you've had
your taco time it's time to clean up if
necessary sometimes I accidentally put
too much topcoat and then it's sort of
flood see cuticle so make sure you
remove that let me show you the only
example I have of why not too long ago I
did some gel nails and I did them poorly
by accidentally flooding some of the
cuticle with the topcoat this was a
problem because the flooded bits of
topcoat around my cuticle made it easier
for the nail polish to just peel up yes
that happened to be a peel-off base coat
experiment video but the point is still
the same don't let any of your polishes
or tacos get on your skin now go ahead
and wear your manicure forever yeah my
next tip is to not do dumb if you
want your manicure to last don't write
it off or pick it off definitely don't
try and peel some hard to peel stickers
with your nails do use a knife or an
actual tool to do the peeling don't open
a pop tune with your nails that's not
what those are for do use a spoon to
open the can
don't use your nails to press things at
a direct hard angle in life like the
elevator do use a part of your finger or
to be safe your knuckle and finally my
last tip to making your mani last is to
not be afraid to do a top up top coat
later on in the week I personally like
to apply very generous somewhat thick
coats of glossy top coat to give it a
real nice heavy seal but not that thick
we're not going to polish mountain now
and that's that those are my tips
for making your many lasts as long as
humanly possible hope you guys enjoyed

funny at all because it was intended to

learning you can call me teacher instead
