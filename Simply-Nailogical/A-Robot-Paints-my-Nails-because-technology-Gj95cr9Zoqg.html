I've got a special friend with me today
it's a robot I just realized you can see
a video of this video
look at that it's called simply
analogical section not too long ago why
don't you actually suggested that I
reviewed this robot so-called again easy
nails now spa paint your nails for you
well great because I need a lot of help
with that I do kind of wish I was as
happy as this Finch though and I
searched for this I saw that a
five-year-old reviewed it on YouTube
already but you can't trust a
five-year-old to review a robot I'm
sorry you need an elder like me I have
27 years of experience playing with
robots and toys that sounds weird
Christine and tip number 47 on how to
keep your nails long and strong and
other people to do things for you this
is how you open a box
don't break it you're gonna break it
thank you ban your services or no I did
it kind of looks like a kettle like
would you like some tea with that I
didn't even look at the back Ashton bull
painted nails in under 10 minutes we'll
see about that I think I've learned a
lot let's begin don't need that anymore
work how do you work probably read the
Shen's in a second and five-year-olds
even read these instructions don't say
anything about parental supervision how
to install and replace batteries look at
me I'm a female using a tool careful now
that's the buttons on the side of the
robot arm and hold the brush oh there we
go yeah well let's start off with pink
so I'm playing a five-year-old today you
see this I should probably raise it put
on let me get a book Lolita
oh good every five-year-old should read
that that's the pink button to move the
arm into the dip position Burke I can't
get it to work I don't think adults
review this kind of thing Starbucks
Starbucks would be great thank you says
press the pink button to move the arm
into the dip position there another pink
button I'm missing these buttons
Esther didn't eat Ben after all so
apparently I got to change the battery
see that I'm gonna go do that and I'm
gonna get a second camera so you can get
a two way double angle dual action view
of the robotics that will be going on
shortly okay we're back now let's try
this again I was yes
the nails on one of my hands is yellow
just one hand does that one not that's
weird
you can see it better now so I think
this is just proof that only one of my
hands is a crack addict hair down look
was cute and all but I should probably
put it up because that's what real
people who work with robots do in the
lab is they put their hair up for safety
reasons now that I figured out what to
do
what hey ready hey hey robot paint
I don't understand what it's supposed to
do go down on my nail but how do you
like get my own now
oh I got it wow this sucks
I see I see it's like a technic thing I
think we need fresh polish because this
polish is like disgusting not even
trying to make this robot do a bad job
it's just not doing what it's supposed
to do it's like in that movie I Robot
where the robots turning into humans and
start killing them maybe I should be
careful what I say let's take the purple
in there at least I know what I'm doing
this time ah that's why they came with
these but dirty brushes in a bowl of
warm water and wiped clean with a warm
damp cloth yeah I don't think that warm
water will clean off nail polish unless
this isn't actually nail polish smells
like nail polish never I don't really
care cuz I'm gonna throw this in the
garbage as soon as I'm done with this
video
place your parts quickly robot you could
be replaced remember that that's what
they tell me on my job ok let's do this
again
purple nail
why don't you go in the hole that's
right
get in there hey my neighbors you're so
close sorry won't you paint it yeah so I
feel like they could have designed this
better here's my first real feedback if
they made the arm move when you actually
press this button down then that would
be easier to let make it go back that I
have to do this and move my hands it's
like a lot of coordination all at the
same time how many hands do you think I
have honestly I'm getting a finger cramp
this is my jam I mean this is your jam
you're not getting in the mood are ya no
he will just turn out terrible so I'm
just gonna try my own nail polish now
obviously a hollow will perform better
it would be great if there was a robot
that could do my makeup because then it
would probably actually do a better job
than I can at my face taking you over a
robot I'm taking over your brain okay
let's pay my other hand cuz this hand is
too fab a two-five I swear a
five-year-old could paint better than
this with their own hands Oh down into
the robot portal la mode engaged right
now here's the chest and see if it's
gonna up my color club nail polish
because I will kill you if you screw
with my hollow
it's been shot out look at that
you just robot came on yourself are we
ready yes are we yell oh yes continue
continue this robot can't paint a
straight line how hard is it for you I
don't understand
pick up that mess you made and honestly
giving up hope you should have invented
a robot to clean this robot you do not
perform all the tasks I require you to
do and while that's sort of clean go go
gadget go straight line straight
straight oh I found the trick you just
use the arm and paint it yourself
yeah Steen you're a genius what's so bad
now samba head up it's an act of God
okay let's try another color this is so
much fun I get dibs nugget in what you
just see that it just picked up the
bottle it's already starting to turn on
me one more time you can do it you
missed the tip go back it er
so beautiful okay well I'm too lazy to
change any more colors so we're just
gonna continue on with this blue no
that's the wrong button bad cuz I'm
wasting so much holo says the girl who
makes nail porns cat hair in there again
let's be friends I don't like this
relationship it's so hostile like I just
need to accept that this robot can only
do a terrible job yeah it's definitely
easier if I don't use the robot part
let's just finish it up that way
get in the bottle I'm ruining my bottle
of nail polish for this put it down I'm
gonna do this and we're gonna do it
right so cooperate the only thing this
can do is paint your nails or try to
paint your nails but it can't do
gradients or anything it definitely
can't do a water marble can you do water
marble hello hello hello Siri are you
there we got some glitter and it's not
Hollow great we've got some cute little
heart jam to things is that it it's not
actually all that came with this give a
little tap just a little tap oh
that was not a little tap I don't know
what I think that actually looks better
than the paint job let's just do my
whole hand why not okay well now I have
a mess everywhere let's continue a
little dab there just a little dab I
wish I was doing the real dab you know
the gradient dab perfect well I think
we've done a fabulous job of doing our
nails Thank You robot for starring in my
video today I couldn't have done it
without you
here's the final look it's beautiful how
would you like it if someone paints all
over you let's find out oh yeah
putting holo on you and she's hollow to
me
that yeah all the flakies oh I'm
making a mess
oh I'm spilling everywhere I'm sorry
beautiful shift in different lights - oh
yeah you look like you're ready for prom
gonna do a little bit of what I do best
that's gradient now dab dab to make you
fat every time I do this the sparkles
like fly everywhere happy new year
although it's Robo oh yeah I like being
dripped all over I would recommend this
product to five-year-olds as something
to paint
in their spare time grass is greener on
the robot head so I'm just gonna paint a
circle here so everyone remembers where
to plug into the matrix Vinci what do
you think this that's -
 it's a dog here - and the dog
wants to play with munchies but I don't
think she's having it she's like get
away from me you other species and
protect your butt get off me get off
time to finish what I was doing here
we're gonna do it the old-fashioned way
and you read that it says stupid and now
add a quick dry top coat cuz we're gonna
add nail vinyls next I'm just kidding
I'm not wasting my nail vinyls on this
piece of junk and glittering I'm like
Edward Cullen in the Sun just kidding
die robot die let that be a lesson to
all of you okay I think I've gotten my
revenge
now having completely destroys you and
I've concluded that only I should be
painting my own nails because surely
even a child can paint better nails than
this I mean I see proof of that every
day on Instagram
no you just let your kid practice how to
paint his or her nails because that's
typically how you learn things in life
thanks so much for watching this really
informative video I hope you learned a
lot I'm sure you did please remember to
subscribe to my channel so you can catch
all of my great nail tutorials that I
paint myself and for other random
useless like
video thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all later Bob get out of here
done with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
