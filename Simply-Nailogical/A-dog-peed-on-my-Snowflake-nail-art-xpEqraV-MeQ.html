I got snowflakes on my nails because
that white has started to fall from
the sky but then a dog pissed in it cuz
that's usually what happens whenever I
find a snowbank and as it turns out the
little glitters that I put on my nail
look yellow in some way so I'm just
gonna go with that a dog pissed on my
nails if you didn't know I live in
Ottawa Canada which is the capital to
Canada so now you know and we got snow I
start off with the white polish as my
base and yeah I know the white polish
base coat is bad you guys have been
asking for it for some reason so here
you go you bunch of weirdos you can find
my favorite white polish at the link
below in the video description box and I
also made another video a while ago on
what's the best white and this is the
winner because it's like cream on my
nail
santé step away from my cream and go
back to your milk and cookies except to
give me the cookies before I do a
gradient imma put some simply peel all
around my fingers so I'll make mess
what's going on this is a different
bottle and that's not a nail polish
brush it's a bubble blowing nipple so
now you have the option when you buy
simply peel to buy it in the regular
polish brush bottle that I usually use
or like this in the dropper bottle
I guess the advantage
this is that you'll never have to deal
with a messy brush that sometimes gets
clumpy and also some people might find
this a little easier to apply because
you can kind of squeeze it out as you
need more you know except not me I'm
having technical difficulties this is my
first time using it like this so clearly
I don't got the technique down right the
other advantage of getting simply peel
in a bottle dropper like this is that
you can just wipe off the excess on the
tip really easily and bam cleanup is
done just do me a favor and immediately
throw out the napkin or paper towel that
you wiped it on so you can avoid a
really awkward conversation with your
parents and now we begin gradient and
yes we begin with white on our sponge
and then we're gonna put some pretty
blues because they're like the sky and
they're Hollow oh my god this bright
cobalt blue is so bright and cobalt blue
my loved a tingling hollows how deep is
your Hollow
it's like the ocean oh I already
sang this remix oh no simply filled only
takes 2 to 3 minutes to dry and by the
time you've added now polish just funds
you can go ahead and sponge that
right on always do your gradients and
multiple thin layers as opposed to less
thick layers so that you don't end up
having your gradient look lumpy and
crappy like a lump of gold and my
Christmas stocking for being a bad girl
this year these blue hollows just do not
want to cover up the white base ok why
are you being such bitches just cover
that white okay so that was four coats
but now it's time to peel off simply
peel like no big deal
you'll appeal again cuz the appeal is
real I'm so animated today I'm like a
crazy person because I failed to cover
my entire finger with simply peels
sometimes I have my slow moments I'm
just using one of my clean up brushes
from twinkle tea dipped in acetone to
clean up my skin twinkle T cells three
different sizes of clean up brushes and
I personally prefer the smallest one so
I can do this see how I can get super
close up in the cuticle and kind of
smooth out the lines of the nail polish
that I made a mess of it's like
Photoshop for your nails now add a quick
dry top coat cuz we're gonna add nail
vinyls next yeah girl you know you
predicted that cuz you know what's
up on simply now logical channel my
nails look good but now my cuticles are
dry so I take an empty nail oil pen you
can see my favorite nail oil the link is
down below and I just use the pen to add
a little bit of hydration to my now dry
cuticles because of acetone but not too
much oil because it's not a massage and
I gotta take pictures so I'm gonna use
some snowflake final yes cuz it's winter
and there's snowflakes that never look
like this in real life though for once
these vinyls are not actually from
twinkle tea and to be honest I have no
idea where I got them like a year ago a
friend gave me a pack of random nail
vinyls and I could not tell you which
shop these are from there's so many nail
vinyl shops out there getting a little
ridiculous
twinkle tea does sell snowflake vinyls I
just don't have them yet and of course I
use the best white polish to cover this
because no other milky polish will
accomplish what I'm trying to do here
heal up the vinyl slowly
yes opaque snowflake is on my nail
perfect in one easy coat how about that
bitches let's do another one
because there is a lot of snow outside
my window and I hate it I mention that I
hate the snow and the cold one of these
days I am gonna move to Florida I think
I would fit in really well there with
all the 67 year olds I could do all the
grandmas nails I can teach them all
about Instagram and snapchat don't you
want to see some granny snaps the only
problem with painting grandma's nails
all day is that when I ask them what
color they want they're gonna say oh how
about that lovely dusty pink color no
granny that's boring pick another one
whatever do you mean this most color is
splendid I swear my grandma's bowl of
nail polish is full of like baby ugly
muted pink sand moves and I kind of just
want to throw up every time I look at I
just got an idea for a Christmas present
for my grandmother I'm gonna get her
some Hollow
Thank You Kristine you have been so
helpful in this tutorial all right now
vinyl snowflakes are done and now we're
going to add some iridescent to those
snowflakes with these white icing loose
glitters from twinkle ta you know what
these are exactly like unicorn skin that
I discovered in my holographic shattered
glass video not too long ago they're
just in a harder hexagon shape the loose
glitter form but they truly are the
skins of the unicorns can't you see you
see it you see it I see it
and now how are we going to append the
our skins to our nails with hollow of
course like you even need to ask I'm
using this hollow taco which I put a
link for it in the video description box
I'm applying it over my winter scene
because I'm gonna make that winter
nighttime scene farkle I work quickly
because the unicorn skins only got a
limited amount of time to stick on to
the hollow taco so I'm just randomly
placing the unicorn skin glitters in the
snow flakes and around the snowflakes in
the sky and bottom of my nail because I
don't know like there should be a
mountain at the bottom probably doesn't
that make sense sometimes I do my nails
and I don't have a plan I just do them
and then things happen I don't really
know what this is supposed to be but I'm
just gonna go with on December 25th the
heavens opened up and Jesus was born a
unicorn his skin shed off and fell down
from the sky onto a bunch of virgins
the Virgin's were actually Hollow
and not virgins at all so all of them
got together and piled on top of each
other with the unicorn skins and had a
big orgy and then this mountain was
formed and then a dog peed on it
you are now educated in hallo ISM
religious studies a plus for you you're
welcome
now look at this snow on my nails yeah
got Hollow and
car scans on my nails and they're also
pretty and they make me feel a little
bit better about having to face winter
let me know where you live and if you
get any snow where you live because if
you don't get any snow where you live
I'm going to hate you alright guys
thanks so much for watching see y'all
later back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
