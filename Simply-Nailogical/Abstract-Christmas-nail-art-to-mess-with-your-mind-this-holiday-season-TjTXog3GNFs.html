it's almost Christmas and I have one
more Christmas nail art design to get
out of my system before I'm out of time
and this one is just so me I mean look
at all those gradients and all that
Hollow in fact there's nothing but
gradients and Hollow in this mani it's
just so simply no logical much excites
so much excite start with your yellow
filthy peasant nail well at least my
nails are yellow filthy peasants and
then make it green yeah make it green
and shimmery and hollow with this
gorgeous bright green cupcake polish
Hollow I put the link below it is
glorious so joyous day and then we're
going to take some simply peel liquid
latex and apply it around our nail on
our skin to protect ourselves from much
disaster because nobody wants an
unplanned pregnancy on Christmas morning
or nail polish in your cuticles we're
going to do step one to making this
abstract Christmas tree it's actually a
cod rupal scaled gradient for those of
you who speak simply an illogical ish
and I'm using just two different green
polishes per gradient because I don't
have much space even on long nails who
simply feel sparkles when it's dry look
at all that glitter oh my god I'm so
distracted take my very narrow gradient
on the sponge and I start applying it
towards the base of the nail in order to
do a quadruple scale gradient you got a
mentally split your nail into four
pieces piece one two three and four I
made another video on a triple scaled
gradient that's very similar in fact
it's pretty much the same as this just
not green so you can watch that instead
if you want more tips and tricks on how
to achieve this technique I mean master
the technique you going to master it the
first layer of a scale gradient that you
do closest to the cuticle line is
usually the worst stance where you're
going to have some extra polish yuck
it's pretty much my fault for jamming
the sponge into my cuticle but I really
wanted to make sure that the dark green
was at the bottom of the nail I had a
quick dry top coat because this
is gonna save your life and let it dry
definitely let it dry very thoroughly
between 15 and 20 minutes if you're
using a good quick dry top coat next up
it's time for your first nail final I'm
using the chevron slash zigzags whatever
you want to call it it's the great
debate from Twinkle t because they kind
of look like a Christmas tree I'm
applying simply peel on the side I don't
want to get excess gradient mess on and
since the first part of my sponge is
dried up I'm just going to flip it over
and use the other side be sure to focus
the dark green part of the sponge right
up to the nail vinyl so the tips of your
Christmas tree will be super forest
green I did two quick but thin layers to
get it completely opaque and then peel
off simply peel and your nail vinyl to
reveal the first level of your Christmas
tree congratulations you're on your way
to being an insane person now add a
quick dry top coat again I know how
about we play a little game and you guys
count how many times I applied a quick
dry top coat in this entire tutorial
first person to get a right gets a
magical cookie and I usually only hand
those out for first comment now we're
repeating the same deal with the nail
vinyl and oh my god
how did we not notice what's on my other
hand oh so magical so princessy so
wonderful so hollow ok guys I'll tell
you a secret
I thought color Club hollows were
Strong's but these cupcake polishes are
bomb I mean look at it oh my god it's so
pretty I put a link down below back to
the tree because my old sponge is dried
up with green I just cut it and birth a
fresh new sponge so fresh and so clean
clean so fresh and so green green so
lamely
o Christmas tree o Christmas tree thy
leaves are all scaled great
to add another quick dry top coat you
countinue counting and do it all over
again for the last time I promise at
this point you're probably sweating
because you're hoping and praying that
you left enough room on your nail at the
tip so that it didn't look ridiculous
when you finish you know how some people
go to tree farms to pick quote-unquote
the right Christmas tree well in this
case it's on you to make the right
Christmas tree that's right yeah
sometimes I feel like I narrate these
tutorials as if you're actually gonna do
them yourself and now you're gonna peel
off your final nail vinyl and simply
peel to reveal the Christmas tree but
now we got to use nail vinyls to turn it
into a triangle-shaped tree because
sometimes abstract only goes so far into
making sense in people's minds generally
you would be adding another quick dry
taco before applying more nail vinyls
but I just thought like I'm so sick of
applying top coat so I'm just gonna take
the risk on the tip of the nail I figure
I'll just make the sides of the tree
this golden champagne color because
that's the color theme I have running
throughout all my other nails which we
have still yet to get to because this is
taking a long time and now I pray that
you don't peel up the tip of the nail
ruin everything huh yes we did it we did
it my friends
Christmas is accomplished and of course
the one time I don't you simply peel I
have all over my finger because
there was a lot I used a q-tip to kind
of wipe it up but this is why you
shouldn't because you get little hairs
stuck there back to my clean up brush
and now we gonna make the Death Star
I mean Star Wars is over and I still
don't know anything about it but what I
do know is that this wrapping paper I
got from the dollar store is gold and
it's Hollow look at that shiny rainbow
Hollow so it was pretty much impossible
for me to film cutting this out into a
star shape because I'm not a tiny elf so
I just cut it into two tiny triangles
and hey what you know it kind of looks
like Star Trek not that I ever watched
it but seeing all these memes helped may
the hollow star be with you or whatever
movie that's from okay finally let's do
our other nails yeah we're gonna start
off with this glamour
champagne Pappy color fun fact did you
know that Drake grew up in Toronto which
is where I grew up I didn't know him but
I could have so yeah cuz we both started
from the bottom now we're here yeah
except my here is nowhere near the same
here as Drake's apply simply peel all
over your finger around your nail
because she is your best friend and we
are doing the gradient dance again you
don't gotta worry about shoving a
gradient and a tiny narrow space on your
nail this time though cuz we got the
whole nail on our sponge
we got the whole wide nail on our sponge
oh my god look at this color brings
tears to my eyes it is so gorgeous it's
like a magenta berry oh my god pick me
some of those berries now give it to me
it is truly one of the most saturated
intense hollows I've ever seen in my
entire life that's not even my editing
that's the actual color of his magic I
literally got it in the mail like
yesterday and I just had to use it but
one of these days I should really do it
justice and make it be the main star of
a nail art tutorial anyways I'm just
doing a simple horizontal gradient of
the champagne color to the berry Hollow
color and it only needed two thin coats
because that berry mm yeah she's opaque
peel off simply peel like no big deal
and oh yeah I love it when I get a good
peel oh that's so satisfying never mind
totally my fault for not putting this
simply feel far enough around my finger
though add a quick dry top coat are you
still counting and let it dry add some
simply peel again I know this tutorial
is just like the same tutorial 18 times
this time instead of a scaled gradient
we're gonna do a reciprocal gradient
because I just like to confuse you take
some striping tape ooh look at that
hollow yeah you almost got distracted
and stopped going forward this tutorial
didn't you I like to cut up a bunch of
pieces and put it on the top of a nail
polish bottle but then I realized I put
it on top of soon bleah field and I
still needed to use here what an idiot
now I'm just placing the striping tape
vertically up and down the nail at an
equal distance between the spaces to
each other and
whatever it's so I had to do this when
your nails are so curved so hard you
want to make sure you press down real
hard on the striping tape towards the
cuticle area because that's where shits
gonna get messy you can cut your dried
up sponge from last time and get a nice
fresh sponge you don't really need to
see this again I just like seeing the
nail polishes in action as they soak
into the sponge oh yeah so shiny but you
got to focus and remember that you're
sponging on the colors in the opposite
direction as the ones underneath because
that's what makes it reciprocal you know
the typical of the reverse of the other
color I'm just playing dumb I know what
reciprocal means the dictionary told me
after you've reached opacity with your
sponging just peel off all the little
striping tapes to reveal the magic you
may be thinking okay Christine what does
this have to do with Christmas
and in my abstract brain this kind of
looks like a present okay so that's why
it if you have a little bleeding of the
colors not to worry just take your tiny
cleanup brush dip it in a tiny bit of
acetone and wipe out the colors do it
really gently don't press too hard and
wipe off the colors on a paper towel in
between or else you will ruin everything
add your final final last that means
last glossy top coat at least for this
nail don't forget your other nails they
need some glossy top coat satisfaction
love - and there you go you a Christmas
boss you're also a hollow boss and an
abstract art boss pretty much makes you
the bus of life guys I'm so happy that I
only used hollow nail polishes for this
entire tutorial honestly it just makes
my life more complete speaking of hollow
have you seen my music career debut
video yet better go watch it hello it's
me in the video oh alright everyone have
a happy holidays and see y'all next time
bye
