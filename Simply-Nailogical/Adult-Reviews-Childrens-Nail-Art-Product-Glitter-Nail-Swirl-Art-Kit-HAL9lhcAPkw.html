shit what's on my boobs this is not
coming out video just kidding I did that
a long time ago as a low sexual but now
you too can come out in style with these
shirts this is the only time I'm going
to invite you to stare at my boobs
hmmm there's also a hollow it's me
version for those who want to be a
little less forward and you can get
these t-shirts right now today I put the
link below in the video description box
these are limited edition t-shirts that
you will only be able to get in the next
two weeks because as we all know Hollow
is just that rare and that precious if
you want one be sure to grab yours now
before you can never get them again I'm
honestly so happy with how hollow this
turned out I was a little reluctant and
hesitant at first I was like there's no
way you can make shirt with like real
and hollow like really Hollow so today
we are not just talking about my shirts
we're going to review a very useful nail
art product so a few months ago a
channel called cookies cookie swirls or
something reviewed this in their video
there was talking Barbies and other
stuff
so not really sure what was happening
and then a bunch of you guys asked me to
review it obviously you need a qualified
nail channel adult to review this
product properly just another a dolt
reviewing children's toys and now we
must open the box Ben is unfortunately
not here at the moment otherwise I would
ask him to do this part it's very
dangerous
instructions yay
I'm not sure why there's fake nails in
here but we'll find out glitter not
hollow course you never put the good
stuff in kids products for some reason
this reminds me of Hungry Hungry Hippos
just without the hippos ages 6 and up oh
I'm qualified then step 1 place your
rubber piece onto the center of the
spinner oh let me set up a second camera
for you so you guys can do this at home
along with me yeah we did it gold star
for everyone well actually just me step
2 place your nail set on the center of
the spinner I'm so disappointed I
thought we were going to do this on my
actual nails not pink nails this is shit
step 3 place the button to turn the
center no prep press press the button
that's not turning
that's not turning or spinning anything
we must troubleshoot no that's not even
spinning this little thing well this is
not fun anymore
the thingy appears to spin freely so
it's not there this thing does nothing
really don't think six-year-old should
have to do this to play with their toys
you
looks like greasy weird
not lubricated correctly that's what she
said wow this is the worst cog in the
machine engineering project I've ever
seen I'm not even an engineer it's
really nothing I can do like
how am I supposed to make this better
don't buy children's toy products to
waste my money okay okay well I give up
you spin it a little it'll spin yeah see
but not when you press the button like
the instructions specify who are you
gonna call ghostbusters no just been
it's broken made like shit well it's not
the video I don't know what am I gonna
do this isn't funny
I need to make a video about something
okay see you soon
cat hair on my hollow oh wait a second
they'll have to do it the old-fashioned
way spin it ourselves
step 3 press the button to turn this
better yet add one color at a time onto
the the nails to get the best effects
this nail polish like I don't know like
not coming out childproof my new ready
shit I thought it was gonna spin god
damnit hey let's do that again
ready ah shit got it all over my hand
I need an adult to supervise me glue I
think this might be colored glue Oh does
it peel ah doesn't sound good I could
just do this yeah there we go
whoa problems a bench it's what all
children need to learn its
problem-solving also how to be smart on
social media they should learn that too
the cap for this bottle is stuck inside
of this cap I'm out come out wherever
you are
yeah that's not coming out so bring your
child in me oh I see what this does
yeah this
just like a water marble it's like my
water marbles my spinning skills ready
takes a lot of the hand hand
coordination
it's like mustard this is what I do with
my hot dogs all right now let's add some
glitter got to teach children about
little baggies one day yeah bitch yeah
bitch that's more cuz I'm a glitter
hoever stop that Kristen you're so
inappropriate this is a children show
Gold is for gold diggers like YUM oops
oops okay hope I can't stop this is kind
of fun still looks like Melanie Martinez
threw up on that care so hmm this
masterpiece is missing something what
could it be
probably some Hollow oh the hollow is so
sacred though I don't waste it
but it really needs hollow much better
these don't look anything like these
kind of feel like like I'm cooking oh oh
that was too much salt Christine with
make a glitter Mountain oh we forgot the
stickers I know you guys must think I
don't try when I review these garbage
garbage products but I really don't
think there's much you could do to make
this work and look good um so now that
I'm done I think I mean like it can't be
any better how do I get these on my
nails I do not see a step 5 where's the
instructions on how to put this on your
hand come on come on let's go we chipped
a nail cut it Oh a murder has occurred
on Sesame Street ooh
do I really have to stick these on my
nails like do I really love I'm so
hungry where's that perfect Oh beautiful
last one guys I'm so ready to go and
in stir on this right away oh I can't I
can really see the resemblance between
what's advertised on the box and what
ended up happening on my nails yeah
my advice to six plus children subscribe
to my channel
instead of buying this bullshit maybe
just don't repeat some of the things
that come out of my mouth shameless
self-promotion begins again right now
look at my shirts guys they're so hollow
that you already put one in your card
and checked out didn't you you Savage
Hollow sexuals if you haven't yet you
can buy my shirts at the link below
right now in the video description box I
mean I gave you hollow for your nails so
now you can have hollow on your body but
only for the next two weeks because they
are limited edition and they will never
be sold again after this they come with
two sayings hollow sexual or hollow it's
me in two different colors hollow on
black top or hollow on white top and in
two different fits
there's the ladies fitted tee or the
unisex T because hollow sexual support
equality yeah look my boyfriend Ben
loves his simply swag yeah get him boy
get him now I searched all the t-shirt
makers in the land until I found the
most hollow foil ever to be put on a
shirt because there will be no skipping
out on the hollow with me nah but
because the hollow is so sacred we must
take care of it so you got to wash them
properly you may have to ask your mom
about that
I still have to ask mine because if you
ruin the hollow you will defeat the
purpose of the shirt wash your shirts in
the gentle cycle and hang them to dry so
you don't mess with the hollow make sure
to follow my snapchat that's simply no
logic Cal yes without the El they didn't
give me enough space and maybe I'll even
give you some laundry instructions like
your mom I want to see you guys in my
hollow shirts so when you get some don't
forget to use the hashtag simply swag
and if you're on Twitter I might even
retweet it and where you can only get
them for the
two weeks get them while you can or else
you're gonna be angry at me when they're
all gone I'm pretty sure this is the
first video that Ben hasn't returned in
time with my Starbucks pick it up at the
link yeah I thought it wasn't gonna
happen in time for this video and now we
have the traditional Ben gives Christine
an drink yeah sure thanks
take my nails No thank you so much for
watching this amazing product I
experimented today Ben you really missed
a good time with no thanks so much for
watching and we'll see we'll see y'all
later bye
Reggie do you like my nails she's like
don't make me look at those mom they're
hideous you're gonna get cat hair on my
shirt oh shit shit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
