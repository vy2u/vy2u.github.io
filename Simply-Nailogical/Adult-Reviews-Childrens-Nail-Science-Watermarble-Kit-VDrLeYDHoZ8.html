art is a science hello everyone it's me
Christine again your favorite 28 year
old who reviews children's toys you guys
have been tweeting me almost every day
for at least a month about this thing
I've also seen this very same product
played as an ad before videos on YouTube
including my own I think YouTube trying
to tell me something I am grateful that
even during these dark YouTube's time
ads are still playing on my video thanks
God I'm a g-rated family-friendly
Channel so you may have witnessed my
past struggles with water marbling put
in drop down the boom big shot you know
I have a conspiracy theory everyone who
can water marble is a wish so let's see
if I can be a witch today I've shown
some promise lately oh my god it works
till exalted maybe I'm growing up and
getting more evil possible since YouTube
wants us all to know about this product
anyways we're gonna watch the ads
together
your fingers drop design tips dry
gravity makes your nails look slide
estrone fight or you didn't even dip it
wait a second conspiracy theories I get
dry
shop I'm just kidding it wouldn't be
photoshopped it would be printing it out
on a sticker and transferring it onto
you
they make it look so easy what are you
trying to do teach Millennials that
every fuckin thing in life is that easy
let's read the box shall we holy shit
you can get Instagram likes with this
eight hundred fifty seven thousand likes
that's pretty good now polish not
included damn I needed some more gravity
causes to polish to spread out into a
really thin layer holy shit my mind is
blown this actually going to teach me
about science okay wait a second nail
art is a science so you mean to tell me
that water marbling is not witchcraft
it's behind well this is not a project
for me this is clearly a project for
none other than simply nerd logical well
hollow class h2o
now science can't and Christine that
nail-polish bitch we don't need witches
anymore that's what we've got science or
electron microscope scientific chart
nyan makes your nails look smart let's
open her up look at the periodic table
damn it my name always falls off I don't
know who the devil is this is all I need
to do sign Matt was the frog dissection
oh god damn it
someone's gonna lose an eye and won't be
me as I'm wearing goggles wait a second
I knew it looked familiar oh my I think
they were made in the same science lab
what it is it look like pieces from
mousetraps what is this a scientific
measuring cup these must go here good
job Christine you can do what a
three-year-old is let's read the
instructions adult supervision required
then I'm going to need you to watch me
oh shit you got to put batteries in pain
physics cuz I'm doing anything
oh the life changes color hiding in the
club bub I mean work health shake all
nail polishes all of them really subtle
take so long bill would be car
three-quarters full of water chairs so
let's be appropriate size adhesive for
your nails and he says fake nails I'm
going to use my actual nail because I'm
a big girl now
oh wait you want some feel porn yeah you
do know she's swimming mask off the area
around your nails with tape what kind of
scientists don't know about liquid latex
I'm not taking any chances
insert a pipette into one nail polish oh
that's what these are for we're going to
extract the nail polish like a specimen
why would we just drip it on the water
like that right
I'm amazed that myself or I mean time
use the stir stick that's this they
provided to blend the colors blend Flynn
lists note if the colors won't blend
empty the beaker and start again you're
preparing us for failure oh shit I think
it's already dry I mean it did say blend
of the colors so number one let's try
this one
well I mean I fucked it up I was
supposed to do thanks Kermit maybe
you'll get a d-plus I got some fresh
water
let's try this again
working like it used to
I don't get it what am I doing wrong so
ever be smart okay I'm just going to try
it use a stick to remove excess polish
here I'm using a q-tip learn that trick
from a witch oh my god it doesn't look
terrible Wow you know what's the science
of the satisfaction behind peeling
things now that's something I want to
learn what we really need is two beakers
so we can do the control and the
experiment a be testing you know I say
we do that what do you think come on
girl teach me I can't use the dropper
things anymore we'll have to do it the
old-fashioned which way drop it in with
the brush
and here we have the middle Kandra it's
the powerhouse of the cell thought this
was supposed to explain you I'm talking
and touch anything
the science of water marbling please
tell me what about this is scientific so
so far I have learned nothing except I
still can't do this man wait a second
have a hypothesis it might be that the
white polish is too thick I mean the
viscosity levels are too high
it's amazing what I remember from 15
years ago let's try a different way is
working isn't working yes it's working
bad they've got this like flower design
going on yeah right I don't understand
because they don't actually explain in
the instructions how to drag it you
would think that's important you know
what they say this just something
science can't answer
okay I'm kind of sucking it up but that
part looks good Tom just gonna dip quick
hurry get it in the lot oh my bad I'm
not sure if I can replicate the exact
same conditions though there's so many
extraneous variables mostly just my
infinity what quickly out of my way
think we can make that work sure why not
hold your breath when you go underwater
wow I feel smarter already
if I ever go back to school again I can
use this on my application skills water
marble science you know what I would
like to know whether or not that
extremely happy girl in the commercials
did those water marbles herself because
if she did then I give up but if she
cheated which wouldn't be the worst
thing in fact I have about six videos on
how to treat and I'm reveling you should
check them all out
then this is promoting false male ideals
for young girls looking good but I'm
just going to clean up around the edges
okay we're done I think doing this is
that place your fingers in the nail
dryer on the base why would we drive
them as we're you haven't put on a
glossy copper or better yet a hollow
tack oh no science experiment is
complete with those of magical rainbow
properties of the holographic element
one day it will be recognized on the
periodic table now we add that glassy
tackle and now we've dry
oh thanks man why are now is that must
say my nails looks like nt you want to
learn how to be smart
can you spell smart good job we will
shelter you from beauty expectations of
women ng where you got again side I'm
gonna have to homeschool alright class
so what did we learn today generally
speaking I think the intentions behind
this company are good that being wanting
to promote science to young girls and
let them know that it's cool to be smart
and do scientific things however there's
something about using vanity
stereotypically women's products like
nail art and I know they have a makeup
kit as well to show them that that
science reads a little problematic to me
not to go well simply sociological on
you it's the best way to teach young
girls about science to pass off beauty
exercises as science I'm not really sure
this is science in a meaningful way at
least why not just teach young girls
about science not science for girls
listen I don't mean to drag the fun out
of my usually snarky and sarcastic
videos but there's something about
things like this that bother me just a
little I think you can be both a girl
who likes nails and makeup and glitter
and all that shit and also do smart
things like actual science or math or
engineering or technology said the girl
on the internet who makes stupid nail
and makeup video a little did you know I
do ship it is and stupid outside of this
channel I went to university for seven
years got two degrees and now I worked a
day job as a crime statistics analyst
surprised don't because girls can do
both stupid fun beautiful shit and smart
people shit are not mutually exclusive I
don't know why the shit is kind of weird
for me to talk about so publicly have
for the water marbling site
kid why don't you guys leave some
comments down below and let everyone
know what you think is this a good way
to get young girls interested in science
or is it kind of dumbing down or passing
off beauty of science for girls if
you're interested in more simply
annoying logical feel free to follow my
snapchat where I sometimes rant about
staying in school
one thing I'm happy about though is that
actually water Marvel's my nails look I
am honing my craft my witchcraft let me
know if there's any other potentially
gendered and problematic science
experiments you'd like me to test out on
my channel well that was the most
serious I've ever gotten in one video I
think I'm gonna go now
man it's hot in here all right boys and
girls thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
