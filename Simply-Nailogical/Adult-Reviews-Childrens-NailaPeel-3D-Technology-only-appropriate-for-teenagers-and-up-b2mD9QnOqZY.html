children why do we give our children
garbage things
well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again and I've missed you
children's toys it's been a while well
actually not that long and I think that
our are you are you okay she already
broke it but I could not resist this
particular product
now appeal hi I'm Christine I'm 29 years
old sometimes I play with children's
toys please subscribe but whatever
okay I just want to bring out the child
in me I don't know about you but I've
been getting tons of ads for this
product every time I watch it YouTube
video because YouTube knows what I like
as a consumer obviously it's those
targeted and practices hard at work and
you know what it works I bought to nail
appeal 3d technology all right we got
the deluxe color kit and the rock of
kicks yeah kids we gonna rock out with
our colors up ages 8 and up just
checking a hundred-plus nail designs Wow
how much time do kids have these days
how was a child supposed to open this
 I'm in my toys mom there's a tab
that says easy open where's the easy
open bitch doesn't twice our lives Wow
Dale appeal oh my god is that hollow on
the bottle holy it is I'm actually
fine nail appealed deluxe color kids
adult supervision required
requires contents 5 gel polishes this is
real Jo Paulette okay let's watch the
nail appeal commercial
I love these commercials they're always
one of my favorite parts I don't know
you tell me
wait there's three kids I only bought
two that look like such a fun slumber
party I I wish I were there we've also
got their product demo video from the
official nail appeal YouTube channel
because I don't want to read your
instructions I'm 8 years old just show
me what to do
hey guys ready to turn your boring nails
into awesome nails excuse me did you
just call my nails boring you little
bitch
the first thing we're going to do is get
your gel ready remove the cap like this
no I can't do that with my nails be sure
to keep the protective plug handy then
at the tip of your choice so you can do
your own design so weird it's like a
pink zit definitely not gel polish cuz
if it were gel polish we would need a
gel taco and an alien lamp duh now
here's where the fun begins
grab your nail wheel and let's get into
it go wild it's got these cool design
templates that make it really
fashionably fun and pretty simple to use
oh and that one look at that hard it's
so pretty she sounds like the num noms
girl don't mind me I'm just having the
time of my life oh and this one I use
very little gel are you just having the
time of your life
just wait to let the designs dry check
your grant no tweezers I'm like a doctor
literally operating on fabulous nails
can you feel it I literally can't even
can't even what yeah like this you can
reuse the nails oh there's the peel in
the nail appeal I was waiting for it and
I think I did these all by myself and
didn't have to go to a salon or drop
tons of money for 3d nail art did those
yourself no I'm gonna selfie them
and make the famous what kids think take
a selfie get famous whose fault is this
nail appeal yay yay yep it's official
we have ruined children's okay I'm gonna
stop being the angry old lady now no
hate to the voice actor who I'm sure is
actually like 27 years old but it's just
the choice of language that I'm sure was
scripted that just makes me wanna die
literally not that I'm any better
influenced that's not what I'm saying
holy on their commercial with 4.4
million views there's 13 comments
they're censoring the children it's okay
kids you know what I'm not gonna censor
you comment down below and tell me
something I don't know
alright now my second favorite part
reading the instructions even children
need to be prepared okay you know kids
do your research before you do
warning not suitable for children under
six years wait the box says four
children eat enough the instructions say
no children under six years so what
happens if you're six or seven years old
huh
toy Giants didn't think of that yes I
was a smartass as the child and I still
am do not eat or drink while handling
this product but see I'm so confused
because half the children's toys I play
with are edible only applied gel and
nail decorations to the plastic nails on
the
nail discs do not apply directly to your
own nails
I was ready keep long hair and loose
clothing away from the gel oh thank God
I put my hair this gel is not like gel
nail polish and should not be used under
a curing light or in a similar fashion
then why the do you call it gel polish
you said it last two children okay I'm
ready this is why you need parental
supervision kids let's start with the 3d
nail tray because they're gonna need
some time to dry Wow oh my god what
should we do look there's a unicorn
let's make it pink
what oh my it's not clear I'm gonna be
late pinkie in water I better hurry I
don't think you're supposed to let these
dry before you white bit or whatever
click quick hurry up your mommy is
waiting do your homework ready Wow
holy kind of made some of them
agree diat let's do that again
Oh am i ruining it okay I wanna peel how
long do I have to wait for these to dry
let's have a look at their suggested 100
different nail designs card wait a
second
this card only goes to 60 whatever let's
do number 12 that looks pretty cool I
guess let's start with a purple base
coat it smells like plastic what is
actually this silicone gel now like the
same that's in boomin clips so it
doesn't look like there's any actual
tutorials on how to do any of these
designs well I'm just gonna have to put
my nail art skills good news if your
skills aren't up to par no worries let's
do the fishtail design like this and
then you do this and then you just kind
of layer each line overtop of the one
underneath like a braid
Wow
okay what do we do next okay I'm really
uninspired I'm gonna make up my own I
didn't open this box there's more colors

I just realized my hiccups went away
thank the Lord just like them no payment
in this one got a bunch of letters what
should i spell only have one mold per
letter the alphabet I'm gonna need to
pick a word where no letter repeats
twice why does only one word come to
mind now give up okay bitches tell me
what yeah alright let's get you dry oh
that's right we were gonna do something
wild do those like spikes they were
doing in the commercial come wild yes
come out come out wherever you are oh
yeah and I call this now even when
you're 8 years old you gotta start
thinking about your financial future ok
like 90% of the designs on the box are
using these little jelly thingies so
let's see if they're dry okay like maybe
it's just not dry enough but this is not
coming out at all those do this this is
what emo preteen we would have done but
of course add glitter just like a pinch
of sugar just like your parents do
sugar coat everything everything that's
tough in real life my eyeshadow looks
sorry wrong video hey let's use green
let's draw a succulent
oh damn it I forgot dizzy cream had zero
pigment okay all right this better be
dry what amazing freed email
technologies I'm gonna try to salvage
this mo by cutting the film around it oh
my god it's so cute the boys are school
again it's so impressed using an exacto
knife gets a little sticky thing is so
much more effectively there you go kids
step four we're move the nails up and
down to break them off the wheel oh my
god now that's kind of fun to get the
nails off it's like you twist their
heads off yay alright let's put our
nails on oh
so the nails are just a little short but
that's okay you know I just moved them
up towards the tip and now it just looks
like I need a fill these kind of look
like bubbled nails a poorly decorated
cake like I decorated it where did you
get your nails done because I got mine
done at a sleepover party
so my honest review is that this is a
click trash I mean are we really
surprised though you know no one's
putting high quality products into kids
toys it's just so unfair what does piss
me off though is in their promo videos
they make it look so easy and it
actually is executed quite well like
there's no way that purple was not that
fake there's no way anyone can get it to
look that perfect in fact I would like
to speak to the producer of the
commercial I want to come to my slumber
party my nails are too long for these
yeah it's made for children of
children's toys always been terrible or
have they gotten worse and worse over
time I don't remember them being this
bad but I played with like racecar toys
and stretch arms or better yet throw a
dance party let's throw it dance party
I used to have dance parties in my
bedroom excuse me well this was fun but
I'm just looking for the peel and nail
appeal
let's see if they peel off oh oh my
god oh my god I didn't even need the
fake nails cuz look it becomes its own
nail I take back every bad thing I said
about this product they should make a
sequel to this toy Nayla peel the peel
porn yes yes they'll appeal I'm just
kidding let's try this fun are the dots
gonna come off in their own rows oh my
god
oh you know what this means
I can save my nail please for my family
bag well this was fun and all but as far
as I'm concerned are you guys like my
trashcan aesthetic it's hollow and it's
trash so it's basically me comment down
below Widow the children's toy Oh
 you want me to play with
alright everybody thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all
