children's nail toy I swear I've been
good this year and that you have no
reason to put me on the naughty list
PS can you please send some savory
salmon treats for men gee it's Christmas
oh my god well hello everyone it's me
Christine again and I'm 29 years old
this is nice to meet you and it's been a
long time since I played with the
children's nail toy on my channel so I
am very excited for this so many of you
guys have hyped up this num noms nail
polish maker because you keep commenting
about it on all of my videos bless you
Santa bless you I don't see an age limit
though I don't know if I am allowed to
operate this all it says is not
recommended for children under 3 okay
we're good Mickey you're not allowed to
play though okay
sorry maybe next Christmas why is there
always so much packaging on children's
toys I just want to have fun and tickly
I just want what I want what I want it
all right we got and nail polish
ice-cream maker so these are the nail
polish colors I think oh we got some
bananas Ben's gonna like that one got
some strawberries I understand is this
food or is this nail polish what's this
white nail polish ah it says milk
perfect that's just how I like my white
nail polish nice and milky would you
like some num noms would you like some
tea yeah actually give me my adult
beverage princess
num-num why'd you let me do anything to
you I could just like look at her it'd
have a good time okay where were we
maybe we should read the instructions so
I can get into the mind of a child
QuickStart Oh QuickStart I like that
step one remove the brush from the top
of a Nam what is Nam
you mean this this is my nail polish
bottle okay
slightly twist the nozzle of the glitter
bottle to the left to open it where's
the glitter bottle I did not receive a
glitter bottle kind of ripoff is this oh
this is a glitter bottle haha I see
am I supposed to go like this though oh
god I've ruined the place I just want to
understand what the actual premise of
this toy is I'm gonna have to watch a
video tutorial num noms nail polish
maker oh my god there are so many videos
with children reviewing this nom nom
nail polish maker why alright well let's
watch the official one uploaded by it's
Friday night oh you got big plans
nope just playing with kids no choice oh
well I have big plans to the num nom
nail polish maker num num noms we need
to make this Polish stat come on num
noms this is heavenly Froyo she is VIP
when are they gonna make the
nail polish let's add a flavor but Nanna
it is so you do squeeze it right in oh I
could smell the banana scent already and
they are supposed to smell like fruit
put the bottle in the mixer
and it's done don't mind me I'm just
having the time of my life oh my god
okay then I just want you to picture
this for a second but in most videos you
see like this there's an adult num-num
sitting by themselves at a desk
somewhere numb talking like a child I
would go anything insane all right well
I think I understand this now it's just
important that I am well prepared to
test this and give you a comprehensive
review because I want you to make the
best decisions about what Christmas
presents to buy your children or or buy
for yourself if you're six okay now what
color should we make first friends it's
not working why doesn't it want to come
out anything as hard as I can mom how is
a six year old supposed to figure this
out if I can this childproof I think
you're supposed to turn this let's see
if we can do this one on the ice cream
stand oh my god no oh nail polish
overboard this is a workplace safety
hazard let's add some glitter
ibiki its iridescent glitter they
couldn't spring for hallow kids toys are
so cheap okay now what I don't have very
much nail polish in here because it's
all on my table let's try this milky
base
doesn't even go in the bottle it just
sits on top no no no I didn't
see a mess in the num noms promo video
you just can't trust children's toy
reviews if they come from the toy
channel themselves you need honest
impartial unbiased children or even
better adults like me so I've mostly
filled up my first nom nom I want the
fun part except I covered that part with
nail polish so I can't read it this is a
workout thank sex a child to do next
I just want my heavenly Froyo nom nom
well that's not really mixed so we're
gonna have to do it the old-fashioned
way
it's called just shaking it with your
hands oh wow that is very sheer what
color nail pose do you want then place
your order here banana polish coming
right up if this is supposed to be like
a frozen yogurt thing because it says
heavenly Froyo then it should be named
mint cheese can i fire myself please I
understand why does it fill up like I
don't know maybe the engineers should
have done a better job make it make
sense back then insert it into the NAM
insert it into the num see it doesn't go
in it just shoots back up why you think
I'm just an irresponsible child well I'm
not yeah we're clearly missing something
no those kids who reviewed this they're
lying well did they get it to work yeah
they're lying yeah see you're just gonna
get it anymore tell that to the kids oh
yeah get that banana
all right well I guess in all fairness
we've got to at least try and put the
numbness on my nails but first because
I'm already wearing some nail polish
it's time for some tea oh yeah it's
about time I peel off my combo of 69
different nail powders it's no longer
available sorry it was oh yeah that was
a nice good fresh peeling
oh yeah all right now we paint all right
let's try this beautiful strawberry
shortcake shade oh wow
pretty it's a little more pigmented than
I expected Wow so pigmented okay this is
um banana yellow designed by Ben looks
like I didn't even put anything on my
nail let's make Christmas design and
some green this brush is so tiny like do
you see this my nail is longer than this
goddamn brush I don't ever remember
getting gifts like this when I was a
child like these things did not exist or
maybe my parents just never bought me
this for Christmas I got things
like Stretch Armstrong I had an easy
bake oven but I don't think I ever
remember any nail products or let makeup
or you know woman's vanity type products
that were designed for children the
world has changed what's happened to us
this was supposed to come with stickers
where's my stickers all right what do
you think
what's that you think it needs holo I
couldn't agree more I say I like the way
you think let's just grab some of these
hollow flakes dive in a little but it's
put some on the tip I'm trying to go for
an understated Christmas elegance look
that still reveals the child inside of
you and there you have it friends nails
by nom nom noms now nom nom nom what and
that's it right we're just paint our
nails there's no homework after this did
the num nom shop not come with a taco
how does that even make sense ok your
food shop and you don't have a glossy
taco so don't understand what this is
though so strange it like smells so
familiar I swear when I was a kid there
were these giant cupcake things and they
smelled the same like artificial
strawberry rubber anyways who wants to
wear your dress this nom nom wanna go to
the mall this makes total sense oh he's
so beautiful
alright well if you're wondering um what
toys to buy your child for Christmas
this year I guess it depends on the
child your child could have the time of
their life playing with no not the time
of my life or they would have a better
time just watching youtube videos about
it that would have probably been me as a
child I was such a smartass if Santa got
me a garbage toy I was not afraid to
tell him that he got me a garbage toy I
mean look at this mess
who would give this to their young child
Santa gift you want your cookies and
milk bitch
alright well as such all I want for
Christmas is for you to subscribe to my
channel
thank you thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all later man
do you want some of my num nums man
hello Ben look at my num num I got a
headache from myself yeah well it's my
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
