you're a child and you're still watching
this video without parental supervision
then well Santa isn't ready to bring you
your presence hello everyone meet
Christine again welcome back to my
channel I hope you're having a happy
holidays as I was doing some Christmas
shopping stumbled upon this top notch
gift right here Disney frozen nail
polish wonder if it's actually frozen 18
pieces non-toxic keelboat peelable what
why didn't you know satin I bought it
anyways thank that the real reason why I
thought it was because the box
immediately attracted me to it speaking
of Hollow what do you think about my new
holidays tree huh used to listen to
music got me as and now all they're good
for is Christmas tree decorations you
can check out that video on my second
channel simply not logical you spin me
right round baby right round let the
hollow play right round rainbow day
alright let's let it go and open up Elsa
I'm expecting some Disney quality shit
okay box is so pretty I don't want to
throw it out ooh the caps are blue
hollow and I don't think any of the nail
polish is hollow no it's not sadly no
Hollow by you mislead us with your caps
it's just like an advent calendar for
kids this is what I did to an advent
calendar all the chocolates on the first
day is it just me or do a lot of the
colors look the same whoops I realized
that my nails are painted so let me just
take that shit off
oh yeah you feel me so good baby I told
you this wasn't a kids channel applied
to clean nails to remove use rubbing
alcohol what it says peelable nail
polish so why would you use alcohol like
what are you trying to make kids do get
drunk Elsa you're such a sloth
and yes my nails are yellow what color
are your socks though doesn't matter
does it
wow this has surprisingly good coverage
what I thought this was gonna be shit
just one coat of doesn't have a name but
there's a picture of a snowman on it do
you wanna build a snowman
something like that I've never actually
seen the movie frozen what is this stuff
smell like Oh smells like glue and those
fragrance sets you used to get from your
grandma when you were 12 how's
everyone's a December going would you
guys ask for for Christmas do you guys
like my lipstick holy shit
it is peeling Wow what of you guys have
asked me recently to try kids nail
polish specifically peel-off nail polish
my guess is it's probably the same shit
is this
so they're you I'm trying out kids
Khilafah polish if you ever see any nail
products that are just so being stupid
definitely send me those links yeah you
can hit me up on my Twitter tweet me all
that bullshit I want it all instead of
watching this terrible peel porn what we
talk about all that Elsa horn going on
on YouTube lately evil Elsa kidnaps
frozen Elsa and that's some bondage
spider-man and Elsa kiss after a bad day
mm-hmm she forgot her clothes frozen
Elsa kiss frozen ass spider-man cry gym
prank Elsa married alien fun superhero
and real-life frozen elsa loses her
dress there's actually more than one
video of that tire there's so many
videos about Disney people getting naked
what the fuck and you thought my channel
was a
influence to children kind of want to
see some Elsa on Anna action though
although who knows if it would be hot
enough okay I'm leaving Oh actually
that's terrible so see-through for they
all like that
oh well finally I was wondering where
the bullshit part of this kids project
was I have a better idea man why did I
peel off that polish in the first place
imagine I actually started a kids toys I
just reviewed a bunch of dumb products
and just said how you don't know her all
children would lose hope for their
future now let's pick some shimmer
colors that match isn't that pretty
little dealing imagine these nail
polishes just froze your nails like on
contact
I think this manicure is missing some
nail art though the audience is
currently grinding their teeth and
hoping that I don't write the word on my
nails again do you like what I did
online this is the kids Channel
is that appropriate don't worry I got
you people who are afraid of words oh
yes what does that spell Elsa yay frosty
and Elsa went to play in the snow but
then he closed the door a dress and said
hey be my ho see what those Elsa porno
videos on YouTube are doing to me that's
almost it I've got for you today except
I couldn't leave you hanging without
some Elsa peel porn mmm on a you better
be easy oh yeah girl that's what I like
to see oh come off of me now let's peel
off the S because else is so sexy its
else's favorite danger
don't forget the EE which stands for
easy money
alright frosty it's your turn Oh murder
oh yeah look at that love the way it
just bends right over for you

quality family time
