coming up so how about American pride
flag nails
gay pride flag Plus American flag Plus
hallo equals awesome because America
just legalized gay marriage in all
states oh my god simply no logical face
America ah gonna be a homosexual nation
meanwhile Canadians are like finally we
did that like ten years ago now pass the
maple syrup how do you not really an
accent I Knights nostril yet so y'all
turn next if you think my American pride
flag males are corrupting your nation's
symbol or whatever it's now art calm
down I was super happy to hear that
America finally decided to allow gay
people the right to do things that every
other citizen got to do before and now I
love America even more so I made these
rainbow pride nails for you guys I start
off with a white base coat because I'm
going to put on a bunch of colors and
you can watch my what's the best polish
video if you want to hear jokes about
milk and car paint now I don't really
need to be applying simply peel latex
barrier around my nails right now
because I'm not doing a gradient or
anything super messy but I'm addicted to
simply feel so I just put it on like out
of habit look at all the rainbow colors
I'll be using this one's from quo quote
by Orly it's only in Canada take that
American here's the rainbow gay pride
flag I test painted the order of the
polishes on paper first
you'll see why what's all these random
symbols and scribbles you ask nail art
coat I'll never tell
I'm going to be making six different
colors of stripes on my nail but I'm
going to start
messily with the first three you'll see
you don't make sense later I promise
don't worry about straight lines for now
just paint the purple and then paint the
green a little bit further down don't
worry about making a mess and this is
where simply fuel addiction is a good
thing because you can see that I got it
all over the sides of my nail but it's
fine because I got simply feel for later
then paint the orange stripe take your
tweezers and peel off simply peel and
there you go it doesn't matter if you
came like a 2 year old child
add a quick dry top coat because we're
going to add nail vinyls next let it dry
for 15 to 20 minutes then add simply
peel again around your finger cuz you're
addicted I can't stop adding simply peel
around my finger I do it while I sleep i
got these thick stripe nail battles from
twinkle t and you can use my code simply
for 10% off and they're the perfect
thickness of stripes that I wanted to do
this leg business take the first one and
cover up a straight perfect line of
purple and then again over the green and
then again over the orange now we're
going to take our red polish and paint
it towards the base of the cuticle red
polish in your cuticles is the devil
thank God we're addicted to simply feel
this yellow neon isn't quite opaque
enough to cover the colors below so I
had to kind of goop it on then royal
blue then start peeling off the vinyls
to reveal a beautiful seamless rainbow
you can gently scrape off any dangling
bastards with the toothpick add another
quick dry taco and if you're going to
comment below
that's how many top coats good for you
you made an observation cut the vinyls
in half and make the shape of a corner
square because this is going to be the
flag star section I'm using a dark blue
s you need midnight kami to fill in the
square damn you go back where you came
from I take a small nail art brush and
dip it in a white acrylic paint cuz now
I'm gonna
to paint tiny stars which is the most
impossible task for me because as you
may recall I can actually paint I really
don't know how they do it I have no idea
how all those French nail bloggers paint
tiny tiny objects on their hands
I can't even paint stars they just look
like dying white starfish or starfish
that are in the middle of throwing up
but you throw up on you help disguise My
Dying starfish I add a holographic
topcoat because the only thing missing
from the American pride flag is hollow I
got too excited I put it in my cuticles
and now my nails are proud to be
American you're offended by this video
because you're anti-gay rights take that
stick out of your ass and go kiss a girl
cuz you'll like it unless you're a boy
watching this video then move go kiss a
boy I welcome the male species to watch
my videos but I always assumed it was
girls until I saw this 6% of you are
male YouTube knows what you're doing
male species but the guys watching this
video please stand up and tell me what
you think of my nails but actually
they'll comment below because I really
want to know what
my nails the sad thing about this
awesome hollow nail tutorial is that
among the support of comments there's
likely to be some anti-gay crap if you
don't support gay marriage then you
don't have to marry someone of the same
sex God the world is not ending it's
just changing get over yourselves and
lighten up let people love who are the
hell I want if you're still going to be
an ignorant asshole only so stupid
comment below please remember to leave
your address where you live so I can
come to your house and make out with you
and then marry you I'm just kidding I
wouldn't cheat on Munchie Oh mention I
love you the only thing weird about this
is that I'm your mother
a kitten pride yeah I got kids too cat
and I liked it if you were offended in
any way by this video and you support
the LGBT community I do want you to know
that I truly did not mean to offend gay
rights at all and I hope that you can
all see that I was just using humor to
make anti gay rights people
uncomfortable if you were offended in
any way by this video because you're
anti gay rights then too bad thanks so
much for watching guys and remember love
is love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
