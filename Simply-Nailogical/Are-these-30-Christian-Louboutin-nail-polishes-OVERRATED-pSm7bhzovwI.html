Christine again as you may be aware not
too long ago the fancy designer label
responsible for putting red paint at the
bottom of people's shoes in that with
some equally fancy polish that look like
you could stab a bitch and even more
recently they came out with what they've
called the Looby chrome just kind of a
weird word when you think about it you
guys are all tweeting the news articles
and snapchat stories on them to me so I
decided okay mr. Chris tree fancy boots
hang you've gotten he had bottoms and I
spent 30 American dollars on each of
these plus like five hundred dollars
Canadian what is even in here when
status is the bill so sick honey sorry
when I place the order for these online
a couple days later Christian Louboutins
called me on the telephone started
asking me to confirm my payment
information and address and I was like
you want me to tell you all my payment
information and my address this must be
a scan but it wasn't a scanning I just
embarrassed myself
oh you peasant you return policy wow
that's a lot of conditions for 30
dollars each these polishes better be
hollow and driving a Bentley I say this
well this isn't the most expensive
polish that I own I have unicorn pee
have you heard of it very rare but this
is the most expensive Louis Vuitton
Christian Aluva ter whatever the fuck
your name is
Chris Pam with the CH so Christ Christ
Chiang Christian how do you like that
Wow
I really like the bottle obviously
that's the main reason why about them no
I'm a unicorn I really don't feel fancy
enough to be in the presence of these I
need Starbucks and are your nearest
Starbucks okay thanks Mike here you go
your register
thank you having a swordfight want to
play wait come play with me there's a
third one you can be the third one oh by
the way do you guys like my eye shadow I
tried to make it mad
this rainbow can you see it can you see
it does it look good yes
no okay this simply snaps quad knows
what's up you should really follow me on
snapchat I post very high quality
educational makeup tutorials among other
life lessons all right that's enough
waiting you better live up to the
highest level sign up getting like
really carried away with these feel
powerful holding me like I can direct
traffic yes please proceed or start a
fire I'll stab a bitch Wow it's nail
polish one thing I am noticing is that
the brushes are really fuckin smile
maybe half the size of what I would
consider the average nail polish brush
what's the fuck more money for less
brush makes sense to me shut up and try
it Christine hmm interesting
I've already got my feel off base coat
on by the way if you were wondering I
mean it's okay coverage but it's going
to need two coats to make it a little
less see-through
the most obvious thing I noticed right
away as a homosexual is that these
polishes aren't hollow now the polishes
themselves I don't think Louis Vuitton
with them I always thought that up
Christian Louboutin Louboutin whatever
it was not advertising these as hollow
polish but for some reason or another
the media said these unicorn holographic
polishes
one day they will look I hate to break
it to you if you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about okay let's try
the rent not really read kind of in
between pink and red we'll call it pegs
or rink whichever you prefer the red is
a bitch here and so I would also use two
coats for that I mean it's pretty I
don't know it's red and no the purple
now that's the color that I like needing
two coats of Polish isn't necessarily a
badging in fact it's a pretty common
thing when you're working with colors
marilla achieves and just to coat the
effects of 20 layers of traditional
lacquer what's the thought are you even
smoking hey you need 20 layers like this
and it looks real good you jealous I
mean the finish is okay it's kind of
shimmering metallic nothing new or
innovative and it's definitely not
hollow but it's nice if that's what you
like a little shimmery a little metallic
and maybe I should have painted the
underside red
I do like the pinkish red and the purple
not so much the yellow not my thing
I already have yellow nails I don't need
yellow polish I mean these are pretty
you know but what's on my other hand
it's a beautiful purple holo that I have
been wearing for some time now and guess
what if less than half the price of the
Christian Louboutin non holo
polishes huh really tough decision I
know know what we'll make these look
better adding a hollow Chaka oh yeah so
you be finally they look like they're
worth some good money I mean that
they're okay they're not bad there's
some OPI polishes that are pretty
similar stay look maybe not the exact
same shade but pretty close I do really
like these bottles the rainbow is so
pretty and now I'm a new look on and I
just want to keep stroking it what I've
seen so many companies and news media
articles using the word holographic or
holo to refer to things that aren't
actually hollow all in something hollow
and it's fucking silver hollow means
rainbows but not just rainbows shifting
rainbows you watch my other video for a
much longer
the nation of that like they think that
Hollow is cool or something
so they just left the word Hollow on it
some makeup companies are definitely
guilty of this too yes I'm talking you
beautiful people so many companies using
the hollow name in vain
shut through the heart and you're too
late you give hollow a bad name like I
swear there's got to be some statistics
on this so people just increasingly
using the word Hollow and not knowing
what the fuck it means come on Google
Trends we only value empirical evidence
here Paulo Paulo shoes what do you know
how about holographic holographic makeup
I wish you could also plot another line
to show whether or not the companies
using that word knows what it means I am
increasingly scared of myself holiness
that's pretty handy wonder for my next
video I should heat this up to a
thousand degrees and then stab someone
with it before we get too carried away
into murder I'm gonna go now alright
guys thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
