know what a hollow is if you're a
regular on my channel you're probably
like where the hell did her sexual intro
go and if you're not a regular you can
just go ahead and click that subscribe
button because there's no turning back
now do you guys dance to my intro
because I do because everything in the
intro is hollow ok that's enough of that
let's get to science Christine the
science Queen pristine the science queen
okay I'm done being stupid and these
glasses are fogging well hello class and
welcome to a much-needed lesson in
simply hollow Walla Walla Walla Walla
Walla Walla Walla gee wallow wallow all
OLG ecology 101 it has come to my
attention that some of you out there
don't know what a hollow is oh my god
Becky look at the no hollow and even
worse
apparently some of you are confused
about your hollow sexuality and we can't
have that so I'm gonna teach you all all
about the hollow so we can come together
and share the wisdom and knowledge on
this very important topic got a notepad
and a pen
yeah well that you don't need those for
this class ever hear your teacher say
that before all you need is your
photographic memory pop quiz
how many colors did you just see dududu
didn't kind of the answer is rainbows
the answer is holo as a warning to all
please remember to shut your door lock
it maybe put earphones in depending on
whether young children are present or
earmuffs i'm UPS whatever other muffs
you think might be necessary to shield
innocent minds from what you're about to
see next protect the young from the nail
porn or you could just let them see it
and educate them about the realities of
the Internet you know it's this thing
called harm reduction and if parents
would just do that with their kids for
fuck's sake then the internet might
actually be a better place for all ages
okay Christine get back on topic we got
holo to talk about first of all I am NOT
a nail polish expert okay well fine I
mean I'm not a nail polish formula
making expert because I did not
professionally study the chemical
composition of nail polish and whatever
getting ingredients go into it to make
it magical my experience in nail polish
is limited to personal addiction and
maybe you could also count the years I
start growing up in my father's autobody
shop I learnt a lot about different cool
paint finishes while I was there anyways
disclaimer but it's totally possible
that aren't completely wrong about the
technical terminology that I may use in
this video at least I'm a teacher who
admits that so here's the issue we got a
lot of terms in the nail polish
community that bloggers and companies
and random people on the internet like
to throw around to see these ones right
here they all bore me so I'm not gonna
talk about them because I might die of
boredom there's something called a nail
polish dictionary video that was created
by Jess face 90 I think she has 90 faces
be sure to check all them out I put the
link over here and below I'm gonna talk
about all of these ones what do they
have in common they all shiny some are
sparkly shiny and sparkly are good but
some shiny and sparkly things are better
let's investigate shimmer so they got
shimmering properties I'll vary
scientific of May basically it's usually
one color of shimmer which is best
described as ultrafine ground-up sparkly
dust it has a smooth texture once it's
on the nail
some might say that shimmer can have
iridescent properties depends on the
polish and some might say it kind of
glistens like the snow on a really cold
day and Canada Oh
shimmer pieces can be by themselves in a
clear nail polish or they can have a
colored nail polish base shimmer
polishes are pretty but they're not
hollow metallic / Chrome these are shiny
and reflective sort of sometimes chrome
nail polish is marketed as if you could
see your face in it at least that's how
they presented in the bottle but it's
almost always not actually gonna look
like Chrome on your nail it's more of a
brushed metallic maybe a metal satin
finish metallic or chrome polish might
be shiny but it's not hollow because
there are no holographic particles in it
to make it reflect rainbows it's
literally just shine that's it Multi
chrome it's like chrome or metallic
polish but it defies the laws of the
universe it's when one single polish can
shift through a whole load of colors
depending on which angle you look at it
in the light and regular office lighting
these polishes look barring us but once
you're in a room with lights that
pointed all different angles and the
true magic on the nail is revealed so
basically just make sure you're always
doing some crazy matrix moves so you can
show off that true shift in the
automotive industry this kind of finish
is often referred to as chameleon paint
but in Polish land for whatever reason
we tend to call it multi chrome or dual
chrome or ultra chrome not really sure
why maybe we just didn't want it to
sound like there were lizards on our
nails lay keys Flay keys are ground up
flakes of something the reason they are
not the same thing as glitter is because
their edges are usually asymmetrical and
jagged they don't have like the perfect
shape Blakey's will apply smooth on the
nail usually i'm saying usually a lot in
this video
he sounds like I know what I'm talking
about there are two most common finishes
that flakies come in either multi chrome
or translucent multi chrome flickies are
like ground-up bits of color shifting
cars just think of it as if you rip the
right rear quarter panel off that 997
Porsche and threw it in a shredder the
owner might have to get his people to
kill you though translucent flickies are
see-through because that's what
translucent means they usually have an
opal like appearance and the colors
sometimes shift in the light these are
easily confused with unicorn skins this
is unicorn skin okay let's get this
straight to not be mistaken I've peeled
it straight off the challenge the
translucent flake you kind of look like
unicorn skin but they come in finer
ground batches and are immersed in
liquids probably unicorn bone marrow yes
that must be it litter is commonly
referred to as the herpes of arts and
crafts but I resent that term because it
implies it's something you don't want
glitter sparkles it can be any shape or
size of solid ish material pieces but
big enough that you can actually
distinguish one piece of glitter from
another piece of glitter it often comes
in hexagon or octagon or whatever ogon
shapes with lots sides but I've also
seen glitter in circle glitter bar
glitter and even leopard spot glitter ah
sorry I can't help it
litter nail polish is always suspended
in a nail polish base to make it liquid
and actually nail polish otherwise it
would just be loose glitter and we could
flow it around the nail polish base
could be clear or tinted or creamy
grooves the creaminess just clouds with
glitter and then it looks like barf and
you just took all the fun out of having
glitter herpes because you put it in a
bath milk and then it got sick and then
it died and now it doesn't sparkle
anymore
holographic we have come to the key
topic of discussion finally now upon
searching for the term holographic
online I found too many things that
confuse me and don't support at all what
I was going to say here so we're just
going to ignore those to be clear I'm
not talking about holograms or
holography like when you see three
images of famous dead or not dead rap
artists being projected in colors at a
concert
I mean sparkly rainbows that was not
obvious on my channel at all then I've
done a terrible job at teaching today
Z's
the best I can describe hollow is that
it sparkles like a rainbow or a prism
especially when it's blurred so
everybody get drunk and go look at
Hollow no I'm just kidding so these two
polishes look like silver glitter to you
don't they
now what if I blur them that's how you
do the hollow test this test should
really be written into law like the Oaks
test shut out all my Canadian studying
case law that's like no one now if your
next question is so wait aren't both of
these technically glitter and you're
doing really well in this class and I
like you
they are both glitter but only one of
them is hollow glitter and the other is
a boring no-good glitter polish that I
only bought to show you this example and
that I'm never going to use again hollow
glitter can exist in many colors there
may not be as much of a rainbow effect
on some of the more pigmented colors
because the color itself is just taking
over but they are still indeed hollow if
you see some rainbow action like this
teal hollow glitter paint hollow glitter
gold hollow glitter black hollow glitter
wait that was a trick that's not black
hollow glitter
that's gold hollow glitter in a black
jelly base aha you learn many things
today this is black hollow glitter loose
black hollow gooder I have yet to find
black hollow glitter in its purest nail
polish form but I will never give up my
search ever one day I will find you and
to confuse things even more not all
glitter is hollow and not all hollow is
glitter but there are hollow polishes
that are much smoother and don't have
the same glittery texture and they go by
two names because one would be too
simple there's linear hollow polish and
then there's scattered hollow polish
linear hollow polish is super smooth
with very fine holographic particles
they're called linear because you see
the hollow rainbow emerge in a distinct
line or shape I think that's what they
call it
her height oh man I'm mature for all my
geek chic scientists out there you might
call minier hollow a hollow genius
solution Oh
eventually all the hollows just stick
together super tight like a pack of
girls in the washroom at a club
they just won't separate nope let's
stick together
scattered hollows have scattered hollow
particles that are more dispersed like
strippers in a strip club
they don't necessarily stick together in
packs but they all stand out okay so
that was a lot of information now what
happens when you take all these sparkly
magical polishes and throw them together
magic that's what this is linear hollow
in a multi chrome linear hollow with
hollow glitter this is hollow glitter in
a multi chrome that's just well boring
out here what are you doing how did you
even get in my footage get out these are
translucent flake ease of linear hollow
these are multi chrome flakies with
hollow glitter I know your brain can't
take it anymore stimulation now let's
play a game because this isn't actually
school we don't do work here we have fun
but we arguably learn way more while
we're having fun at the same time I
think I just figured out what school
curriculum should be anyways spot the
linear hollow do
good job or not
now can you spot the scattered hallo get
enough done seductive junta I don't know
what song I'm even supposed to be
singing
hallo top deck now spot the hollow
glitter whiffling your hollow in it
chicka wow wow yeah that's their porno
music for the hollow sexuals out there
polish blast
oh wait that's the wrong game isn't it
now here's a bunch of nail porn to make
sure that you don't leave this video
uncertain about your hollow sexuality
what if I whisper apparently hates the
census will make you more sexually
attracted to what you're seeing in front
of you you said working yet good thing
you already closed your bedroom door hey
look it's hollow in everyday life
pencils shoes that you put on your face
hollow cars
someone please arrest me before I steal
this car knapsacks wow I was so deprived
in grade school wrapping paper which I
could just like turn this into a cake
God's gonna do the hollow sphere gift
bags for wrapping presents except I
don't want to give you to anyone else
I'm just gonna keep you
for myself some letter things that you
probably saw in your kindergarten
classroom don't you see the hollow
forces have been with you from a young
age even clothing holy shit I just
remembered I wore this when I was a slut
Navy and money I know it's not crazy I
mean even though the Canadian dollar
shit right now our money is made with
hollow take that America Jem and the
Holograms okay no don't use the hollow
name when it's not deserved sometimes at
night and animals eyes can be Hollow
except it's not night so it can't really
show you look this face hi everyone I'm
the world's first kitten to come out as
a homosexual the face of a homosexual
I'm a homosexual
thank you will and a proud of it
proud of it this is probably why she
scratches me okay everyone gather round
it's takeaway lesson hallo isn't just a
nail polish or an arrangement of colors
it's a way of life even though holo
isn't technically a color if you're holo
sexual then your favorite color is
hollow if you're unsure if something in
front of you is hollow do the hollow
test just squint your eyes and move it
around are you seeing magical sparkly
rainbows does it give you some kind of
feeling what about in this lower area is
a unicorn whispering dirty things in
your ear that's a hollow you're probably
hollow sexual welcome through the club
there's at least 500,000 of us and
Counting but we are planning on taking
over the world if you come across anyone
who says they don't like hollow you
don't take their hollow phobic crap okay
you don't need that kind of negativity
in your life no no you don't get out
Halla folk leave the door is that way an
exit button is over there or over there
I don't know
Tway it would be and in conclusion I
know this video is so long because there
is so much you need to learn as with all
formalized educational learning sessions
I should have an
X or a references section but I don't
because identifying every single nail
polish I showed in this video would take
me two years so I didn't put links to
all of them below but I did pick some of
my personal favorite hollows and a shop
or get most of my hulls and I put the
Lydia Lydia Lydia what's elidio put the
link in the video description box below
see that's how many times I think that's
why I can't see it anymore
so now you can go get your shop on now
that you're all bushy eyed and hollow
tailed I will eventually keyword
eventually do it what's the best hollow
topcoat video and yes a hollow topcoat
is one specific breed of hollow polish
but my real-life office job keeps
getting in the way of my hollow sexual
tendencies annoying
okay so subscribe to my channel because
your hollow sexual now if you weren't
already I have now converted you and now
it's that time where you say butt and I
say hello hello hello you say goodbye I
say hello I'm such a good singer
you should watch my music video next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
