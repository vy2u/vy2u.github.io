again a lot of you guys have been asking
me to do back-to-school nails but you
know what I like better than doing
back-to-school themed nails
doing nails with back-to-school supplies
I was always a smartass in class
if nipples just multiply one of my
favorite parts of going back to school
was always buying all the different
coloring pencils and markers that you
never actually used in school but you
needed them all you needed all the
colors of the rainbow so this time when
you're going back to school shopping you
should not only be thinking about how
important your education is but also
about how you can use all that on
your nails because you can be smart
intelligent and well educated but also
know how to have a little fun before you
die let's start out with these rainbow
pinwheel nails since the whole point of
this video is kind of a challenge to use
only school supplies on my nails and no
nail polish products at all had to use
Elmer's glue as the peel off base coat
oh my god I'm cringing already if you've
been here a while you know how much I
hate glue cuz it doesn't work it's so
shitty it also looks like one of those
hundred layer challenges that got taken
a bit too far now let's make our nails
white by using whiteout for some reason
I thought this would work these little
Rolly tape things but yet it didn't work
at all scratch that let's use real
liquid whiteout
yes look at that creamy white polish oh
the brush is so perfect is this not this
is not nail polish houses not now but
clearly this brush was made to paint on
your nails
holy why did I not remember from
painting my nails with whiteout back in
the day yes I actually did that that
whiteout is super opaque and pretty much
better than any white nail polish wow
this challenge is very easy so far is
this toxic maybe should I be
telling you to put it on your body
probably not should you do things I do
on this channel and take it seriously
probably not next I'm just taking some
pink liquid highlighter and I'm gonna
start drawing a pinwheel thing I kid you
not I actually used to paint my nails
with liquid white out and then followed
by highlighters school hack if your
highlighter is getting too liquidy you
could just leak some of it out on a
paper towel the yellow is not showing up
so much now let's add some green and
blue and a second coat of everything to
make the colors a little brighter now
this looks good but I think it's missing
a little something in the middle don't
know what the hell this is washable art
glazes but I don't know it was in the
school supplies section so it counts oh
this is so pretty you think it was nail
polish sike it's glue of some sort let's
make some porn with it anyways yeah I'm
just gonna fish a little hard out of
here and place it right in the middle of
my highlighter pinwheel there now these
nails are the highlight of your school
day now I can't top coat them with a
glossy taco because that would be
against the rules of the school supplies
only nail art challenge now if you want
some rainbow nails that are a little
more practical and won't rub off on your
clothes of school you could check out my
DIY highlighter nails video I made that
some time ago careful they might
distract you from all those cute boys at
school and now it's time for some peel
porn except
god I used glue on the corn is so
bad I want to go back to guns yeah the
next look both looks and smells really
good these scented markers are my
childhood first we gon start off with
some of that goddamned glue slap on some
of that satisfying whiteout I wish this
came in black don't you guys wish
whiteout came in black oh it would be so
good
grab your smelly markers and I'm
basically just gonna draw a bunch of
fruits on my nails a banana and my pinky
in honor of my boyfriend Ben some red
cherries on the next nail cuz ahh kissed
a girl and I liked it wait what
blueberries I mean no grapes
what are these grapes on my middle nail
and then an apple okay no maybe a peach
okay no maybe the peach posing as as
emoji yeah yeah that's it and finally a
little cute strawberry on my thumbnail
and there you go you got some beautiful
and nicely scented nails so when you're
slaying that math exam and writing
equations at the speed of light you'll
get a bunch of nice whiffs of fruits to
keep you going
alternatively if you want some more
practical nails that will stay on you
during the school day you can check out
these really cool Sharpie bleeding
technique nails that I did using some
nail vinyls in my other video next up
Crayola this is kind of like a gradient
with some iridescent unicorn skin so
it's very me now I know acrylic paint
isn't something we often use in school
but it's something that some people use
it's cool so I'm not cheating okay I
don't know about you but I definitely
got to play with some paint in art class
and grade 9 what do you think of this
then we're just going to take a fan
brush mine is still dirty from that
blindfolded hostage situation incident
hey passing the fan brush mister
assistant and then you're going to brush
lightly over the two different colors of
acrylic paint and they're going to
overlap just a little you can test it on
something first
not your teacher's desk now I would
really like to use some simply peel here
because the shit's gonna get everywhere
but I'm not allowed the challenge
doesn't let me on here goes the purity
of my cuticles swipe your fan brush back
and forth and a light
sweeping motion this is actually a
technique you could use at home like for
real not just for the silly challenge
cuz it does work well to make kind of a
distressed looking gradient to my
surprise all I had to do was wet a q-tip
and literally wipe this off my skin
so ho thank God
Saved by the Bell without the Bell now
that looks cool but it's missing
something
unicorn skin glitter from char Lu cuz
this stuff is meant for arts and crafts
or whatever kind of gloopy but it does
remind me of nail polish that already
exists so who inspired who and there you
go a plus just don't touch anyone or
yourself or anything as a more practical
alternative using acrylic paints you
could just paint some tiny crowns on
your nails like I did in this video from
last year's back to school next up this
design is definitely my favorite because
it actually looks legit and you could
wear this without any worries of
going on all of your friends when you
touch them first I'm taking some black
acrylic paint note to self
this black acrylic paint is let's
add a second coat and a third coat and a
fourth coat it's a good thing acrylic
paint dries super fast next I'm going to
take some gel pens right now I'm drawing
something that many people have been
confused about and that is the logo of
my channel what the hell is this weird
scientific logo Christine what does it
mean and what does it have to do with
nails honestly has nothing to do with
nails I have no idea why I used it it's
supposed to be the mathematical symbol
for area under the curve and I used it
because I was trying to be a smartass
and use a symbol that had to do with a
logic function and just never mind it's
so stupid
on my middle finger I'm gonna write a
really complicated equation one plus one
equals
window one plus one equals window come
on guys if you're also a smartass liked
this video so I know I'm not alone and
that's it you got some chalkboard nails
you could use this technique to write
the answers to your exams on your nails
but don't be stupid don't cheat
on your tests or exams because academic
dishonesty only hurts you and your
future I know I'm always about having
fun and being a bit of a smartass on my
channel but if there's one thing I do
believe in and I'm willing to get a
little serious about that's respecting
the integrity of your education and
working your hardest to achieve your
intellectual potential so many words
fun fact and university I was a
teacher's assistant for a first year
criminology class and I caught someone
cheating on their final exam you know
what happened
they got expelled and that must have fog
sucked for that kid so while I made this
video just to show you guys some silly
 I did on my nails
you are only cool if you stay in school
and you use your head in school
all right that's enough preaching mom
for the next look I thought hey if
you're really lazy you could just put
holo stickers on your nails so far these
designs have been lacking hollow so this
makes up for that I think this look is
great for when you've got too much
homework and you really need to hit the
books at night so you just throw some
stickers on in the morning and you're
good to go
hallo smiley face stickers are the new
gold stars and I got a lot of them and
what about those little tabs sticky
thingies if you've got short nails just
throw some of them tab stickies on and
you've infant we got long nails I saw
these post-its and I thought they were
so cute and I can't really see any way
to put them on my nails but I'm gonna
use them to show you places where you
can follow me on YouTube and Instagram
simply now logical you're here right now
and my new second channel simply not
logical for other random simply
analodjica yes Noel on snapchat there
wasn't enough space and now logical on
Twitter because there
wasn't enough space all right everyone I
wish you all a Happy Hollow and
successful school year in whatever grade
of elementary or high school or year of
college or university you may be in if
you don't care about making your parents
proud this year I don't blame you I
never did either but do make yourself
proud as always thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all in about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
