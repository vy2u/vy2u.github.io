video on what's the best black polish
and since it's Halloween coming up soon
I mean Halloween it's time for every
youtuber to take the regular content and
make it more badass or just make it
black case in point
black is the new galaxy now now wait
black is the new orange yeah that's not
alright so I think it's only fitting
that I paint my nails black
bet you didn't think that one thread
banner a long long time ago I can still
remember I made this video what's the
best black polish the drugstore Edition
and we found a winner but I still don't
think it's as great as Colt nails
Nevermore and so for a year now I felt I
have unfinished business in finding the
actual best black polish in the whole
fucking land while we always hope to
thing that's the best is available at a
really convenient drugstore that's not
always the case
easy now so why don't you relax sit
black and let's find the best black nail
polish again this polish has been my
favorite token black one for the longest
time waiting for the comments to call me
racist but unfortunately about a year
ago it was discontinued and you can't
find it anywhere
and my professionally unprofessional
nail opinion I believe that a black
polish should only require one coat to
be fully opaque any more than that I
don't want to fucking waste my time on
doing two coats of black okay got better
things to do like put holo coats on no
you look amazing
okay so sexy and here you see it being
applied in just one coat on this nail
swatch thingy because painting the same
nail twelve times really had my nails
not looking forward to that so I didn't
do that here it is on my real nail in
last year's video why aren't my nails is
yellow anymore I don't know I honestly
have no idea I'm going to use this black
polish as a baseline to compare to
eleven different black polish
experiments and see if any of them can
match this ya experimental science a
plus if you know about control and
experimental groups it's pretty hard to
demonstrate on camera when the black
polish is translucent enough that you
can see light through it but I'm trying
okay
trang next let's try out this highly
used black polish which was the winner
from my last what's the best black
polish episode put the black polish on
the paper no you wouldn't be doing this
in your life this is just for
experimental purposes you smartass and
it does a decent job at pretty much
covering and one solid coat on the fake
nail as well because the differences are
so small to detect especially on camera
I can tell you that in my personal
opinion in real life the first black
polish does a better job at being more
black if you think that sounds crazy
then please do tell me why mascara
exists in both black and black is black
why would anyone want black when you can
get black as black next up I'm going to
try this one from wet and wild that a
lot of you guys suggested on my last
video that I failed to find in time for
that one this one happens to be only 99
cents so if it works out and it's great
you could give it out instead of
Halloween candy oh oh no I am low sad
it's not terrible but it's not the best
just a quick note I learned from last
time let me tell you that some batches
are made differently so if you're wet
and wild black polish works way better
than this then that's great for you but
that doesn't mean the company makes it
that way every single time sometimes
shit is inconsistent in factories or
laboratories or I I don't know just save
yourselves and try not to be a smartass
in the comments maybelline corrupted
black I like the sounds of this already
ah why is it having an allergic reaction
I did not know this was supposed to be a
textured polish but I guess it's the
textured polish interesting it's like
rabies foaming at the mouth but black
next up let's maybe try another
Maybelline so far I'm not impressed
it looks like Black Milk hey Fred banger
I just found your next DIY has that been
done black milk that's how little witch
infants are raised black milk is good
for nutrients and evil spells another
black Maybelline gosh y'all are trying
too hard
mmm it's better it's definitely better
it's more of a warmer black than the
last one if that makes sense but it's
still far from one coat check this one's
called essence the gel nail polish
except it's not gel at all there's no
lamp or UV light required marketing
marketing marketing black is back though
yes it is back is also black what very
wide brush on this guy don't know if
that matters to you but now you know
this information but it's not full
coverage black so my search continues
funky King fingers I pick these up the
last time I was in Florida if you didn't
know I'm from Canada
a so we don't have these here oh well
that is not a one coder ladies and
gentlemen that is not a one coat wonder
interestingly is quite blue compared to
the other box is it blue or is it black
or is it blackish blue or is it bluish
black and because I'm still searching
for the best black polish ever we're
going to try out some indie polishes
which is basically code for it they're
harder to find but fear not I put links
to where you can buy every single one of
these black polishes online down below
in the video description box even the
winners and the losers you never know in
case you want to buy the losers I think
we're looking better though yeah this is
getting better it's not one coat but
we're looking good
here's another black polish from an
indie brand to try out it's okay it's
okay but it's not one coat you know what
I'm saying yep it's dark it's dangerous
it's black while I sure hope so cuz
that's what the packaging says
hmm this one is it's not quite milky
it's my like a gel
it's like black gel yeah it's like black
hair gel oh there's another good toi
I'm gonna have to say this one is
probably the least opaque so it is the
opposite of what we're looking for on
the scientific experimental mission
let's continue we got one more and if
you're not new around here spoiler alert
you already know that this is my new
favorite black polish because I've been
losing it and linking it in every single
nail polish tutorial where I've used
black in the past few months and I'm
gonna show you why because we love in
science on this channel look at that
black guys look at it it's like whiteout
but black okay it's black out all my
black whiteout dreams have come to life
I already knew this one would win
because when I bought all those other
crappy black polishes I tried them all
and I didn't like any of them so
naturally I use the one that I like I
just hadn't made this video yet and it's
been a few months you know it is
possible to be biased towards something
that you like because that's why you
like it but at least I can demonstrate
to you guys why I think it's the best
because I mean look at that it's best
what can I say and now let's put that
sexy blackest black polish on my nails
oh yeah there's some black porn right
there I mean let me just clarify black
nail polish porn okay don't go twisting
my words and that's one coat no top coat
of the best black polish the winner of
today's episode because it is an indie
nail polish it is harder to find but I
put a link down below to where you can
find it hopefully it's not sold out
after I published this video I am of the
opinion that every person in the world
needs a good black polish in their life
tool kit it's Halloween paint your nails
black your school has a no nail polish
policy paint your nails black parents
don't like your edgy style paint your
nails black you want to be a badass
paint your nails black but wait what's
that in distance that hollow that mother
hollow you know it looks best
we're black girl it's a hollow taco you
can watch my other video and what's the
best hollow topcoat if you would like to
know about that there's two kinds of
hollow tacos if you were wondering one
is called a linear hollow topcoat and
one is called a scattered hollow topcoat
it's all about personal preference and
what you feel best in you know just
remember this month is all about
Halloween not Halloween contrary to
popular belief my next video will be a
Halloween nail art tutorial on my new
friend Corinne from thread banger my new
my only friend any guesses on what it
will be comment below I'd love to hear
what what you guess wrong alrighty
everybody thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you back here next time
