have to excuse my manly voice today I'm
really sick but the people need their
videos right isn't it annoying when
people tell you that the best of
whatever product is some really obscure
thing that's super hard to find well I
guess I do that sometimes but never mind
because today we're gonna do something
different and experiment with 11
different nail polishes to find out
what's the best black polish the
drugstore Edition because sometimes you
don't need to be all fancy and shit now
buy drugstore for those people who live
in the United States
I mean Walmart Walgreens CVS Rite Aid
and I don't know what other stores are
in America I don't live there but if
you're Canadian then I mean Shoppers
Drug Mart or Pharma plus I did also
include some polishes from Sally's
Beauty Supply Store which is more or
less internationalizing so basically if
you can't find the Polish as I mentioned
in this video at your local drug or
beauty store then you should easily be
able to find them on Amazon and I put
the links to all the polishes I use
below including the winner so I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started with the
first black polish and I'm just going to
apply it on a black poster board and
yeah it's looking pretty black
I'm just kidding that would be stupid
let's put black polish on a hollow
backboard instead because rainbows I'm
kidding again what are you stupid that's
even more stupid to ruin a hollow
backboard I'm gonna put it on white
paper okay okay I'll stop something with
you I'm gonna paint the black on my
nails this time guys don't worry
but because I'm testing a million
different nail polishes I need my
favorite peel-off face coat I put the
link down below to easily remove them in
between swatches first up I'm going to
show you my all-time favorite black nail
polish that's not from a drugstore but
part of this exercise is to figure out
which one I can get from a drugstore
because Colt nails the company who makes
this magical black polish went out of
business and they closed their doors
forever and I guess that's the problem
of relying on indie nail polish
companies for your favorites because
they could just pick up one day and
decide to move to Mars or whatever the
hell they're doing so as you can see
this black is black right like it is so
black on paper and on my nail and it's
super opaque and I love it so much I'm
so sad it's gone so I guess let's use it
as a control subject for this experiment
and see who can match up next up let's
try Sally Hansen's black - black what in
original name Sally I hate this brush I
hate this parasha look at it it's like a
frickin horse's tail on my nail and you
can already clearly see that the formula
sucks because I'm getting these streaky
see-through patches or it's the tip of
my nail and I can't work with this brush
it's terrible makes for a terrible
lining around the cuticle area and I'm
gonna put all these polishes on paper
too because I think it really shows the
color of the black that makes sense
but look at all the colors reflecting in
the black the hollow backboard is
reflecting on my nail yes yes yes okay
focus Kristine we know you're sick but
you can't be that delusional
stay on track get back to black so I'm
just gently removing my
now polish with my favorite pilaf
basecoat link is below and I'm doing
this super carefully because well it's
not quite dry and I didn't apply a
topcoat but any time I can avoid
removing my nail polish with nail polish
remover eh
it's a good magical day but we should
talk about what's on my other hand oh my
god yes this is BIGBANG bye lat and pay
at mu Tong
that's French for the nail polish addict
sheep okay well NPA is English for nail
polish addict but mu tall is French for
sheep okay I know these things
I went to French immersion sally hansen
again but in a different bottle style
because i'm convinced it's just like a
cluster full of different types of
bottles at sally hansen headquarters and
they're just like which bundle should we
use for wood polish i don't know pick
one over the pile bob oh that's not
black at all is it what the hell just
happened i just realized this is the
sheer black polish that I made myself
for another video
oops yeah nevermind I'm as organized as
Sally Hansen's bottle production line
what can I tell you another Sally Hansen
black let's make sure it's actually
black yes it says black out safe to say
I think this is actually a black polish
and it looks sheer like what I should
have used this instead of making my own
black sheer polish are you kidding me
yes I shake all the nail polish bottles
before I use them so that's not the
mistake I made
the mistake is the formula okay it's not
me obviously I'm gonna need two coats
for this nail polish but I don't think
any good black should ever need two
coats because any good black is a one
coder and that's it that's all one coat
nope I'm done after that I'm done
next up salon perfect oil sick I mean
oil slick the sickness is getting to my
brain this one's looking a little better
but it is quite sheer at the tip you can
still see that my heels still yellow you
can see the yellow through so yeah
many people will be offended by that so
we can't have that overall I think it
could be a contender for a best black so
let's keep it up high on the list we're
now let's try out Revlon knockout
finally a name that doesn't include
black nail polish come on Olivia Wilde
I'm expecting her to appear at any
second but know this polish is garbage
and it's clearly nowhere near opaque in
one coat what's interesting is that when
I apply it on paper you can see it has a
really blue or cool undertone to it
sometimes to be honest okay I think
karev LAN is colorblind because they
have this other polish that I'm not
including in this competition because it
makes no sense but it's called black
it's black so you think you would need
to be included but it clearly has blue
shimmer in it what I only use for this
polish so far has been in doing magical
rush and drag marble witchcraft and the
secret to doing that is using a very
shitty diluted polish which this clearly
is next up nails incorporated p.m.
London yep that's black taxi cabs ahia
cabs in here now it's not technically
from a drugstore but you can find it
from Sephora which I think most
countries have so it's pretty mainstream
I don't like how short the brushes on
these little stubby bottles so yeah and
also it's thin and not that black so it
would definitely need two coats to do
pink
next now let's try the highly
recommended by you guys sinful colors
black on black it's very easy to find it
it's very cheap I think I paid like
$2.99 what is this pocket change so I am
therefore very sorry to tell you and to
find out for myself that it sucks really
bad it's basically a black sheer polish
and that's very clear the second you put
it on white paper - because you can see
right through it it kind of dilutes or
disintegrates as you apply it to
something you would need two coats to
make it opaque but in my books
that's one coat too many for black all
right let's try se because they must
make good products because they're
well-known brand they look another
creative name that doesn't include the
word black this one too is very sheer
for one coat fine why is it so sure why
is this so challenging
why is perfect in one easy coat so hard
to ask for these days all right let's
try another highly recognized well known
brand this is OPI black onyx or own make
a mix if you say things weird like I do
I like the brush and everything but god
damn why are you doing this to me you
are so sheer this is beyond belief I
can't believe it I don't think I've ever
been this disappointed in mainstream
nail polish companies I'm about to go
crawl back into my indie paper right now
okay and the last one I've got to try
for you today is China Glaze liquid
leather sounds a little sexy better not
be 50 shades of grey on my nail and Wow
oh my god it's not completely sheer I
think we're having a breakthrough
finally polish number 11
on the last one of course you would
personally I actually like China Glaze
brushes because they are thinner and my
nails are narrow and very curved so the
super wide brushes aren't always good
for me but it's a personal preference
thing and here's a funny comparison of
one coat of China Glaze versus one coat
of OPI look at that look at that
bullshit and so I think we found our
winner China Glaze liquid leather good
job even though I will say I still don't
think it's as great as Colt nails
Nevermore it is the best I've tried from
all of the different drugstore or
readily available products most of which
have been sent to nail pili he'll now to
be fair to all the other brands and
products I did try today maybe it is
possible that those particular polishes
work trying to be opaque in one coat
like sometimes they do like to have a
jelly effect and maybe it supposed to be
opaque in three coats but I did do my
research beforehand and the nail
polishes I chose are supposed to be
marketed as each respective brands taupe
and black polish so why would their
token black polish be opaque in two or
three coats that doesn't make any sense
to me maybe it makes sense to them but
not me and now that I've got some badass
black nails let's make them more badass
with the holo topcoat oh my god yes this
is star Lee's Eclipse it's a brand new
holographic taco
you've seen me use the fun lacquer one
before but I wanted to try this one out
to really see how it performed over
black look at those wrinkles look at
that I am going to do a what's the best
holo topcoat but I'll tell you right now
that it's not always about which one's
the best and it's more about like what
your preferences so in this case this
holo topcoat is more dispersed in that
the hollows are floating further away
from each other
that's the look I wanted here because I
wanted to preserve the blackness of the
polish underneath you can find Starla's
hollow topcoat at the link below and
you'll notice that it is a lot cheaper
than the one that I normally use so many
rainbow is yes this is the best way to
wear black polish in my opinion thanks
so much everyone again for waiting like
months for me to get you this video but
hey it's here and I got so many more
planned in store for you with or without
a sick voice we will see comment below
what your favorite black nail polish is
and if it's one of the ones I showed you
here today All Right see y'all next time
