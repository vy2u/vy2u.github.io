walked into a bar
it doesn't matter well hallo everyone
it's me christine again and for millions
of years you guys have been asking me to
do a what's the best match topcoat what
is a matte topcoat and why would anyone
want it to ask well basically you put it
on top of shiny nail polish to make it
not shiny I've done this a few times
still debating those life choices but
hey I've heard people say once you go
Matt you can't go back but you know what
I say to that Happy Holidays bitch cuz
Hollow is where it's at
and I'm starting the actual video now
I've got 12 different matte top coats to
test out for you today here you thing
obviously see that some of them can suck
like really bad some companies obviously
don't know what a matte topcoat is
supposed to do let's test all 12 and
we'll see which ones tell the truth
since a matte topcoat is typically best
well seen over top of black nail polish
painting a bunch of nail swatch things
with my favorite black nail polish you
can watch that video if you haven't
already let's start off with the
Revlon's matte topcoat matte topcoat
creative naming over there now I'm
applying it on the fully dried black
nail polish
Wow aren't you glad that you clicked on
this really exciting video it's just as
exciting as watching paint dry
isn't it just remember that you guys
asked for this
okay everybody that is a Revlon's matte
topcoat fully dried yes it is actually
fully dried and it still looks kind of
shiny on to the next this one is called
fresh paint the matte look could be
described as the opposite of fresh paint
so that's ironic and this is the part
where you question why you are
subscribed to this channel Wow that also
does not look mad at all let's continue
Ice Ice Baby down in turn an anemic do
do okay that's enough
this one was $2.00 from Walmart so I'm
sure it's gonna be great
yep real good job there pure ice now
let's try NYC's matte me crazy
wow what a creative name this video is
getting more and more exciting as a goes
on
okay am i doing something wrong cuz like
these all look like shit so far and yes
I have waited more than a full five
minutes to let these dry so it's not
that they're still wet you smartass
let's try our luck with or Alize match
top coat why is it orange I don't know
oh it's not really orange it's clear
haha would you look at that this one
seems to be a bit more matter uh Matier
what's the word I'm looking for but it's
not what I expected so next oh my gosh
it's the matte effect top coat matte as
in Matthew and no as a matter of fact
that is not the French the French is the
second line top coats matte effect
there's there's big difference oh wow
that one is actually matte okay finally
see it's not me it's them let's try
L'Oreal the magic top coats collection
the matte velvet 800 what the fuck you
man
I paid good drugstore money for this and
this is what you give me bullshit brush
they didn't cut its hair properly
alright here we go
this one is also Matt yay we're gonna
have to compare these all together later
because my memory already forgets which
one if any may be better let's try out
se this one is a classic I don't like
you but I'm mad about you
hahaha yes se yeah the Matt soul brother
right about now - Matt's up okay I'm
going one of the biggest competitors to
se is OPI so let's try it right after
OPI matte topcoat he'll hear one thing
about OPI brushes is that they are very
wide which is actually a good thing when
you're applying a matte topcoat because
you want less brushstrokes and therefore
less streaks oh very matte very mess now
let's try the less popular little sister
of OPI that's Nicole by OPI most people
have forgotten about her by now but
she's still around what the Nicole stop
transferring for the record all the
black polish swatches were fully dried
when I did this this one just seems to
have picked it up for some reason
you almost look exactly like the other
nail polish which is made by the same
company to made you interesting
coincidence what does an Australian with
the sense of humour put on a bottle of
matte nail polish good dye Matt hey it
works as good as the other ones I don't
remember and now for the final mass
topcoat test Sirk Matt look TM top coat
or silk if you want to be ha said please
ignore those two little dents on the
side one of them was my fault on the
black coat and the other one was also my
fault later other than that it looks
Matt alright let's review most of them
are Matt let's eliminate the ones that
are clearly shitty first no no no no no
and a couple more that are Matt but not
as Matt as the others
no no ah we have too many left I can't
decide we're gonna have to go to around
- alright here they are all again fully
dried and I'm shining my phone light
over them so you can really see which
ones are not reflecting the light it's
clear to me that some reflect the light
a bit more than others and the point of
Matt is you don't want any light think
number 3 1 and 5 reflect the light more
than the other to do so let's eliminate
those
oh this is so tough one of them has
these tiny little white dots which in my
experience are a product of the matte
topcoat just getting old
I've had this se matte topcoat for
several years probably as many years as
some of you have been alive and what I
think happens is when it gets old the
little Krusty's fall into the bottle and
then when you put them on your nail they
look like white Krusty's most of the
other top coats I tested however I
haven't really used so therefore I am
concluding that the white Krusty's are
only a product of being old and not a
defect of the product itself and for
that reason because this one is madder
than that one we are going to declare se
matte about you as the winner of what's
the best matte topcoat and now let's
honor the winner by putting it on my
nails
fascinating riveting stuff
really
you motherfucker Estie cannot escape
should have just bought a new one
Christine now I just want to touch on a
couple things before everyone asked me
in the comments well simply no logical
aren't you supposed to apply a quick dry
glossy taco first and then apply a matte
topcoat for it to work the best well if
you mean work by being more matte no
that doesn't make a difference however
if you're doing nail art and you have a
fancy design on your nails then
absolutely you want to apply a quick dry
top coat first so that you avoid
smearing the design and then you make it
matte after but I'm not doing nail art
in this video I'm like no just putting
the matte topcoat on the black and that
is fairly straightforward doesn't need
to be more complicated am I gonna do
what's the best quick dry glossy taco
video no because in my opinion it's
really hard to communicate for
performance or effectiveness of a quick
dry glossy top coat in a video it's not
really something you can see it's just
something you can feel when you smack
your hand into something and your nail
polish gets dented I have in my own
personal experiments over the years
tested probably 10 different quick dry
top coats
if you're curious which one I use all
you got to do is look at the links in my
video description boxes Wow Christine
you really put that information in there
yes I do it's really helpful people who
look they're oh I should really look at
your description box there's information
and descriptions there yes there is why
are you talking to yourself that's weird
shut the fuck up why don't you well
these nails are matte and black
I'm bored let's put some fuckin holo
tacos on it yeah oh yeah rainbows yeah
up yeah beautiful so much better but
what happens when you put a matte top
coat over a hollow taco oh well that's
just ugly and boring I don't see any
rainbows anymore where did they go I
can't find them now what if we put a
glassy taco over top of the mat taco
over the hollow taco over a matte taco
over a black nail polish well the good
news is it brought some of the hollow
rainbow back and the bad news is it just
looks dull the black is not really black
anymore it's more great well I was
curious and don't deny so were you now
what if we put on that taco over no I'm
just kidding thanks so much for watching
guys make sure to subscribe to my
channel if it even matters to you oh and
I'll see y'all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
