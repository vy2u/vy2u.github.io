welcome to one of those rare times you
click on a youtube video and actually
learn something I know a lot of you have
been waiting for this video for like
months so here it is
I finally got my together so your
life usually goes something like this
you did a gorgeous hollow glitter mani
that's my cat's nail polish the link is
below go buy it now and now you're
crying at the thought of scrubbing it
off and or drying the coat of your nails
and skin with acetone or maybe your ass
Watcher and hate the idea of drying out
your cuticles with nail polish remover
in between every single nail polish you
swatch and those situations are exactly
what a peel off base code is for Wow
I mean inventions today they basically
save lives so I'm gonna test out eight
different peel-off base coat solution so
they're called and evaluate them on four
different indicators because I'm a data
nerd application which ones apply like a
dream and which ones apply like
drying time cuz you don't got time to
wait around you want to get right to
painting your nails effectiveness of
removal force Watchers after 30 minutes
of wear you'll see those results in my
other video force Watchers because I had
to split up the videos cuz no one wants
to watch an hour-long YouTube video hell
no effectiveness of removal for a normal
person meaning you're gonna wear the
nail polish for at least a day I work
for 24 hours in this test but really all
we need to know here is how well does
the polish come off after it had time to
completely dry like as an over day I
didn't test out the lasting effects of
the peel-off base coat because then I
would have had to cancel my youtube
videos for at least a month or so so no
but not everyone wears glitter polish
right and for that I also tested each
base coat for swatches and normal people
with a multi chrome polish because a
multi chrome would really show lumpy and
bumpy Nassif
oh dude cause that that means I did a
total of 32 separate experiments using
my nails you're welcome my sacrifices
are your knowledge gain you're gonna see
a crap ton of different products I use
in this video so as always the links to
everything I use are down below in the
video description box and that includes
the 8 different nail polishes I use and
all the different peel-off ace things to
start this experiment I am now naked yes
my naked nails are yellow but no need to
be concerned for my health
it's just stains for my addiction to
nail polish I don't really care that my
nails are yellow and neither should you
watch my other video if you're still
offended by the color of my nails and
now I'm moving on
first up Orly one nightstand things are
getting already I can tell just
by looking at it and smelling it that
it's a glue based peel off base coat
which you'll see is very common for
different peel off base coats on the
market today
I like the brush for this application
because it's long and skinny and narrow
so that kind of helps with applying like
messy glue but overall I really don't
like applying glue based stuff on my
nails because it doesn't level out
nicely and it just feels weird
so Orly you little you get a 3 out
of 5 for application and of course
because it's glue baste it took forever
to dry I think it took like five or six
minutes and therefore it gets a 3 out of
5 for drying time mmm pretty purple
multi crown yeah this is fun lacquer
réunion blessing I don't know I can't
remember one of them but look at those
colors I psych oh my god look at it just
a little bit of porn right here before
we move on I'm showing you the painting
on of the nail polish stuff because I
really want to test and see if wearing
these peel off base coats is going to
affect the look of the nail polish like
if you're gonna make it bumpy or look
shitty no issues with this one it looks
perfectly smooth to me look it's like
Kat Newhall oh yes that's right this is
Mincha the cat of baby pink 100%
holographic glitter now
you can find it at the link below I'm so
proud of my daughter she also starred in
her first horn oh okay I'll stop and
explain what I'm doing so I always apply
glitter nail polish with a latex free
makeup sponge because that is the best
way to maximize glitter polish pay off
the sponge helps to absorb excess jelly
leaving all the glitters behind they go
right on your nail it's great I forgot
to mention I'm applying a glossy top
coat after all of my test swatches
because that's how most people's
Watchers and normal people wear their
nail polish insert a quick footnote here
to tell you that I'm evaluating the
removal effectiveness out of 10 instead
of out of 5 because I'm waiting it more
because it has more influence on the
overall results just trust me I'm a data
analyst by day now let's see how well
Orly one-night-stand removes after 24
hours old on just a second before anyone
yells at me I need to remind you that
you should be using an orange stick
slash wooden cuticle pusher to remove
your pale off base coats and not the
metal tool that you see me using yes I'm
a hypocrite but you know just ignore me
and do as I say and not as I do and how
is this even possible the is still
wet look at it it's like white and wet
same goes for the glitter now I don't
know what's happening it's as if this
peel-off base coat is creating a moist
environment in which your nail stays wet
for 24 hours that can't be good and it
will probably cause bacteria to breed
orally you truly are a aren't you
let's try our luck with NYC New York
color strip me off base coat
what is with cosmetics companies and all
these sexual innuendos it's clearly
another glue based base coat I hate glue
have I mentioned I hate glue the
application on this one is way worse
than or ELISA actually the formula is a
lot thicker and the brush seems really
stiff and crooked and if you look up
close there's tiny little bumps coming
out of this glue maybe it's little
insects that we're breeding on the glue
in the bottle I don't know basically it
applied like crap so get the 200 to 500
and it dried like crap too after waiting
7 minutes it had this like weird little
groove in it I don't know what that is
thank God for multi chrome nail polish
to put me in a better mood this one
changes from pink to gold sorry I can't
stop it with the port I just love it so
much and again the good mood you know
what I mean not that I'm gonna let it
buy as my results don't you worry
I'm a true scientist strangely enough no
application issues with this guy maybe a
tiny bit bumpy but whatever hmm what a
beautiful glittery green which would be
perfect for your Christmas stocking go
run quick tell your crush and as you
kiss them under the mistletoe tell them
that the link is below subliminal
advertising
and now for removal after a day this
really sucks
and this is an example of why you
shouldn't be using a metal tool because
you're gonna end up hacking away at your
nail like I'm forced to do right now so
yeah this is something you definitely do
not want from a peel-off base coat which
is when you have to pick it off in tiny
pieces again defeats the purpose of a
feel off base coat because we're not
really peeling it off are we oh my god
my nails are so damaged right now my
nails are hating me like this one seemed
to fill up a little better but it does
get stuck quite a bit at the end but I
didn't see as much damage overall it
performed at about half of my
expectation so it gets a 5 out of 10
here's Sally Hansen's big peel off base
coat I don't know why they call it big
is that because this bottle is bigger
than one of their other different 800
styles of bottles
Sally Anson was actually last or one of
the latest to the peel-off game they
were like oh we should probably
jump on this dream now yes yes we should
and let's make a glue based product
because that's what everyone else is
doing and we don't have time to think of
something new excuse me while I apply
some nail oil to my very parched dry
nails I think this is like day three of
these experiments and I'm a thirsty
Sally Hansen application seems like glue
and the hoops I got a little fluffy in
there could it be a mint she here yeah
probably I'll just push that up yeah no
one will notice that it's fine it's fine
I should probably mention that for this
peel-off base coat and all the other
ones I'm using in this whole video I'm
only applying one coat I mean maybe it's
like a little thick coats and I'm doing
a couple strokes as you can see here but
I'm not letting it dry and then adding a
second coat ever a peel-off base coat
should work with just one coat and if it
doesn't work then imma throw you in the
garbage Sally like most of the other
glue products took forever to dry this
one with 7 minutes and it still wasn't
completely dry
and still see some of the glue still
wiped so it gets a 2 out of 5 because
I'm really impatient I'm using a purple
to blue fun lacquer multi crown but it
only looks blue in this load angle how
boring and for the glitter nail I'm
using a classic silver hollow glitter
this one's by star elite in my opinion
everyone needs a silver hollow glitter
in their collection it's pretty much a
mandatory thing and now Sally how do you
peel oh this does not seem like a fun
trip no oh not at all this one is very
hard and rigid and it seems like it's
like cracking underneath as I'm killing
it up which makes it not easy to remove
and one solid piece instead I get all
these little pieces that I kind of had
to scrape up and I'm trying to be very
careful not to stab myself in the nail
now surprisingly the glitter did remove
a lot better and I think that's partly
because the glitter itself is a lot
thicker so it bonds together better so
it kind of sticks together when you go
to pressure
peel it off but overall I give it a 6
out of 10 because I really didn't like
how much I had to fight with it on the
multicam 1 and almost risk damaging my
nail all right let's try OPI glitter off
slash natural nail base coat I was
really confused when I first bought this
I'm like do I want glitter off or do I
want a troll nail base coat they're not
the same thing right are they the same
thing I don't know and big surprise its
glue base but I'm pretty sure OPI was
one of the first nail polish companies
to actually take kids glue and then put
it in a nail polish bottle and sell it
for nails so that's kind of original I
guess I did use to use OPI glitter off
well before I found my current favorite
base coat you'll see soon which one that
is because I really like how it applies
compared to all the other glue based
once I've tried it in this video the OPI
glitter off applies much nicer I don't
know like they diluted the glue with
something like
not sticky well it is sticky if you try
to stick your finger in it it would be
sticky like most glue but it glides on
really nice and smooth like you can see
in the video therefore I give it a 4 out
of 5 for application drying time was 4
to 5 minutes which was a lot better than
all the other glue based products I
tried I think that has something to do
with whatever they did to dilute the
formula alright turquoise multi prone to
purple multi chrome how could I not show
you this brush porn like really give me
a break
I don't have any issues with lumpiness
from the glue because it went on quite
smooth and look at this baby's blonder
leather color names-- hollow glitter by
Starly it's in the same collection that
meant cheese in let's see how it
performs an entire day later and yep
that's looking pretty good to me yeah
this is the best glue based fill up base
coat that I've experienced thus far I
know this because I've also used it many
times before
it definitely peels off better than any
other glue based base coat well off base
coat I can't speak anymore there are too
many words that start with the same
letter in this video I struggled a
little with the glitter removal on the
tip of the nail but overall it did
mostly come off in one piece but I've
got a little bit of dryness as you can
see that I'm scratching a way that I
should not be scratching away but this
is a drawback of using a glue based peel
off base coat I find they really dry out
your nail overall it does get a 7 out of
10 they'll be cuz it did its job much
better than all the other glue based
peel off base coats
let's try simply peel as a base coat
because why not you only live once this
is a liquid latex product and you
probably see me use it so many times
when I do my messy gradients because
it's super easy to clean up but I
figured let's try it as a peel-off base
coat because if it can remove nail
polish off skin then why can't it remove
nail polish off your nails so this is
very difficult to apply to say the least
if you've ever worked with liquid latex
in any capacity then you know
it is not easy to spread around for
example if I do one stroke of liquid
latex and then I do another stroke over
top
you definitely risk peeling off the
latex that you've just put underneath
two seconds ago so you have to work
really quickly and carefully with this
stuff that and the brush is quite wide
so I ended up getting it around my
cuticles that's probably because simply
peel is so used to being on my cuticles
that she wanted to get up in there so
sorry simply feel for application you
get a one because well to be honest
you're really not meant to be applied
like this drying time you get a five
though because liquid latex dries super
fast that and she sparkly so obviously
she got a bonus point partly because she
has glitter already in her though and
because she's made of liquid latex
obviously this isn't going to be the
best result when it comes to putting a
multi chrome color on your nails you're
gonna see all the bumps so I do not
recommend using simply peel as a base
coat for any nail polish that's creme or
multi chrome or something where you
would see tiny bumps however there's no
issues with using her under a glitter
nail polish because you won't see all
the bumps because we're piling on pounds
of glitter over top of the bumpy latex
now because of how quickly and easily
liquid latex comes off I would have
expecting to find my nails popped off
like in my pillow in my bed cheese but I
didn't and so the next day I went to
peel it off and you can see it's a lot
harder than I was expecting it appears
like the latex dried and separated from
the nail polish itself so I have two
separate coats of stuff going on here it
clearly did not bond together and that
just makes for a really weird removal
process because clearly the latex had a
mind of its own
but the glitter the same thing happened
you can see that the latex completely
separated from the glitter but it still
came off all in one piece probably
because the glitter was so thick it
bonded together to itself so I'm giving
simply peel a four out of ten for this
removal because it just really isn't
what she's meant for simply peel you
should stick to your day job and go back
to protecting the skin from gradient
now let's try this I'm to peel off face
code and if you've watched any of my
videos before then you will know that I
use it all the time boiler alert this is
the winner but let's show you why cuz
that's way more interesting me to
actually prove it to you
with your eyes this is clearly not glue
first of all it's clear and it doesn't
look like glue second of all it does not
smell like glue third of all I bought
two bottles with it because I loved it
so much in hate glue so much and I mean
I lied I've bought three bottles of it I
just use one up because I'm so addicted
to it and here's more proof that it's
not like glue because it applies clear
and effortlessly like a normal base coat
Wow for once it's great that a base coat
actually applies like a base coat she
gets a 5 out of 5 for application
because that application was flawless
like Queen Bey and BAM another full
score for drying time because she only
took about 2 to 3 minutes to dry which
is what I would expect from a normal
base coat I'm applying another
multi-room and I've been at this so long
I think I forgot how to paint my nails
altogether and clearly you can see this
is the perfect base coat for a multi
chrome cuz it doesn't show any bumps
whatsoever
alright the true test 24 hours later
like a semi-normal person and I'm funny
when I pretend to be one and Wow
oh my god can I get a big holy from
the crowd please
oh my god oh my god look at that
beautiful beautiful thing you should be
even more on the edge of your seat than
Canadian boys at a hockey game right now
perfect 10 out of 10 girl you perf girl
yeah you perv
oh just to bring everyone's mood
town we got to use more glue and this
time it's actual glue aka Elmer's aka
PVA aka school glue number one teachers
burn apparently I don't know so in my
pilaf stuff around the nail games thing
I did mix glue with water and then
everyone yelled at me so I'm not gonna
do that don't worry just for you I'm
gonna stick the brush I had used
previously and my homemade glue into
this dangerous looking hole of the
actual glue bottle you see the risks I
take for you you see the glue monster
could shoot out at me at any second so
again this is 100% straight-up glue and
of course it applies like either
that or I'm applying semen on my nails
so gobby and when you try and put on
multiple coats it kind of sticks to
itself and then it peels and there's
little string things off the nail yeah
can't touch it or look at it anymore
do you like the way I spread like gum or
nah or nah you can stroke my nail until
you drip in good never mind never mind
and application evidently gets a 1 out
of 5 because it's garbage this is about
7 minutes in and it won't dry and I'm so
annoyed right now
and what the hell are you looking at you
cocky mocking cow and a total of 10
minutes later my nail is finally dry and
in that time I could have watched a
superwoman YouTube video but I mean I
did watch a YouTube superwoman video but
that's not the point now let's see how
Glu perform glue performs get
get it actually not so bad Wow would you
look at that the glue clearly took some
steroids or something I don't know I
mean I guess glue just needs a really
really really long time to dry to
actually do anything good my nail is
still very dry after this though even
though I have a lot of cuticle oil on
and finally the last one we're going to
test is yellow stopper which is sold at
Sally's and places like that and I chose
it because I've seen a few nail artists
or nail people rather on Instagram
saying that they use yellow stopper all
the time as a peel-off base coat even
though that's not what it's supposed to
be used for it's supposed to be used to
stop yellow nails but why would you
wanna stop yellow nails like it's
inevitable okay just relax and accept it
embrace the yellow be who you truly are
and don't worry about what other people
think of the color of your nails in fact
I'm pretty sure this base coat can't
stop yellow nails and instead what it's
doing is using a purple tinted base to
make your nails appear less yellow it
does apply like a normal base coat
though maybe a little bit sticky but it
still gets a 5 out of 5 it took around 4
minutes to dry which was a little bit
longer than the unch peel-off base coat
but I think that's because this formula
is a little bit thicker and then I
painted my nails for the millionth time
let's see if yellow stopper can actually
feel off it looks like you're kind of
peeling off but you aren't sticking
together in one full piece and I am
having a struggle to actually peel you
off like it feels like I might
accidentally peel up my nail and that's
not a good feeling you want it to slide
off relatively easy without feeling like
you're stressing out your nail or
pulling on it too
yellow stopper clearly has some
separation anxiety with my nail now get
off me
same thing goes for the multi chrome I
really feel like I have to push really
hard and it kind of hurts because I feel
like my nail is bending as I'm pushing
it shouldn't have to fight that hard to
peel off a peel off base coat hunted
this is one but you get the point and
can we just talk about how I'm pretty
sure that that ripped up a little piece
of my nail right there yeah not cool not
cool yellow stopper I give you five out
of ten because hey you didn't peel off
that well and B you make my nails not
feel safe all right everyone let's take
a look at the results because I don't
know about you I'm exhausted and just
want to know why the winner was the
winner don't forget to watch my other
video on peel-off base coats force
Watchers so you can see why they got
those scores in that column clearly
untoned because the final score bar is
far larger than all the other score bars
I bet you knew that without me even
telling you didn't you look at you
you're a master statistician now now
that I've done all these experiments for
you what am I gonna do with these
casualties oh yeah you know what Scone
up next if you know me then you know I'm
a little crazy and I'm gonna put them
all in a ziploc bag and keep them
forever as I toss them in one by one I
feel a little bit more accomplished that
my nail pili collection is growing look
at all these memories good times and bad
that time I did Russian witchcraft that
time we couldn't decide if the wave was
red or blue that time I did a neon
tribal thing that looked like a bug whoo
glitter I love those ones yeah I know
what you're thinking that I'm probably
so crazy I'm one of those people where
Kappa Jana's to bed oh I wasn't supposed
to show you that if you'll excuse me I'm
gonna go pet my cats now and smell my
bag of nail please bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
