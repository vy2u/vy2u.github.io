version of what's the best peel-off base
coat because I had way too much footage
so it needed its own video but even if
all you do is swatch nail polish I
highly recommend you still watch my main
peel off base coat video because I only
talked about things like application and
drying time in that video in other words
you need to watch both my videos to
round out your education for those who
aren't sure swatching just means when
you put on one color of nail polish
solely for the purpose of taking photos
and then taking the nail polish right
off to do it all over again
so naturally you'd want to minimize the
effort it takes to keep on switching
your nail polish and in my opinion this
also means avoiding nail polish remover
because that can dry out your cuticles
which doesn't make for good pictures and
even if you counteract that dryness by
putting on a moisturizer or some oil
then your greasy skin picks also don't
make for great pictures because it's not
a Kim Kardashian photo shoot in this
video we're gonna test the effectiveness
of removal force Watchers in other words
how easy is it to remove each base coat
after 30 minutes or so after you've had
enough time to take hundreds of pictures
of the same pose and nail polish and now
you're ready to move on to the next one
in your swatch Athan but because we
don't always watch glitter polish I also
tested the base coats under multi chrome
polishes because they would definitely
show if the base coat was lumpy which is
something you really don't want when
you're swatching overall I did 32
separate chests and in this video you'll
see half of them and the other half in
the other video which is more geared
towards normal people who leave their
nail polish on for longer than half an
hour links to all the polishes and
products you see here are below in the
video description box as always we start
with naked nails minor yellow yes but
I'm gonna go it on a limb here and guess
that if it's true then most of you are
indeed swatters out there and you have
semi long nails then I'm gonna guess
that you also have yellow nails so
welcome to the family first up Orly one
night
stand she is glue based like most of the
others I'm gonna try today
now how polish applies on top of base
coats is a very important thing force
Watchers but I didn't want to keep
repeating myself so please watch my
other video if you want to find out more
about how polish applies over top of all
these different peel-off base coats also
fYI I applied a glossy top coat on all
of my test swatches because that's
exactly what's Watchers do well most of
the time I think now let's see how a
swatch er might find this peel-off base
coat after waiting 30 minutes after
taking pictures and I don't even need to
say it but Orly one-night stand you
already suck it's leaving behind like
disgusting clumps of glue and it's not
even peeling off all that well look at
that the glue is still wet after it was
certainly dry on my nail how does that
happen I don't know if I have to peel
off little pieces of base coat off my
nail after I take off the peel off base
coat that defeats the entire purpose of
a peel off base coat let's try the
men'she hollow glitter nail even though
I don't want to take her off she's so
pretty and same thing again disgusting
the glue turned wet how why oh I hate
glue shit and again I have to glean some
disgusting gunk off my nail therefore
202 10 force watcher removals let's try
NYC strip me off available in most
drugstores
she is also made of glue and 30 minutes
later let's try and get naked again this
one takes quite a few pushes to get off
but I mean it's not leaving anything
behind so that's a good sign I do feel
like a dried out my nail a little bit
but I think that's kind of a problem
with all glue based peel off base
product morning guy hey glue it did seem
to peel off quite well I guess for the
multi chrome polish though so I'm gonna
give this a 6 out of 10 because it still
was a little pushy if you know what I
mean
and if I wasn't careful then I would
have accidentally pulled it apart into
different pieces next up Sally Hansen's
version of glue peel off base coat and
30 minutes later force watcher people 32
minutes because I got distracted by the
hollow mic
look at all those rainbows in my face it
removed fine up until the tip this
sometimes happens to me I think it's
because my nails are kind of curved but
at least is not leaving any gross glue
behind so that's a plus but I'm really
struggling as you can see trying to get
the end off and this is not good you
don't want to be hacking at your nails
to peel it off bad
Sally bad and my nail is dried out all
over again great let's see how she does
with glitter again this one isn't really
peeling off in one clean Pole I'm forced
again to really pick at the end and it
kind of seems like it's not fully dry so
again this is a glue base that takes it
clearly more than 30 minutes to dry
okay let's try OPI is glitter off /
natural nail base coat and yet another
clue based product are you surprised
and 30 minutes later what do we got what
do we got this one seems to be
performing like most of the glue based
peel off base product you have to push
it a bit and then there's a little bit
left over at the tip of the nail let's
try the glitter removal and wow that
really sucks doesn't it which is weird
because to me it seems like maybe I
didn't wait long enough but I thought I
waited 30 minutes but pinky I was
getting impatient I don't remember but
in the past I've used to OPI peel a face
with glitter and taking it off in 30
minutes or so around there and it was
fine so I don't know what's happening
here I seem to have extraneous variables
that I can't control how about we try
some simply peel
she's a latex barrier which if you know
anything about nails and I hope you do
because your ass watcher is all the rage
and all things nails these days
obviously her intended purpose isn't to
be used as a peel off base coat and
here's why you can definitely see all
the bumpy's but let's try it anyways 30
minutes or so later and yeah clearly
that's a pretty amazingly clean removal
came off in one full piece no issues at
all and again with the glitter liquid
latex is one of the best removable
thingies ever and I don't have any weird
crap left behind on the surface of my
nail so that's great pink my nail is
just dried out from the abuse that it
has taken up into this point
this is aunt field off base coat which
marks the first peel off base coat
that's meant to be a pillow a base coat
that's not made out of blue finally even
before I peel it off I would say that
this is the best peel off base coat
force Watchers because it's so smooth
and it applies like a regular base coat
so you're not gonna get any weird bumps
or anything like that at all
now let's watch me take it all off and
look at that beautiful comes off with a
little bit of pushing and then one nice
pull let's try it again for multi Chrome
I'm just pushing a bit gently here
because I don't want to stab myself and
then I peel it off at the tip and I
always seem to have this problem with
the size no matter what base coat I use
that's cuz my nails are really curved
and beautiful look my nails aren't even
dried out during this they don't appear
to be as straight out as they normally
are after I use a glue peel off base
coat and I'm gonna give you a ten out of
ten but mostly because you didn't ruin
my nails therefore you get full points
and of course before there were any
Sally Hansen or OPI or NYC stripped me
off or any of those there was actual
glue and glue was always a weird strange
and well disgusting thing to apply to
your nail and after waiting basically
years for this glue to dry on my nail
let's see how well it removes after a
year plus 30 minutes I can tell already
that the glue base was very thin hence
why it's not really sticking together
that well and I don't really seem to
have a lot to hold on to when I go to
peel it off this is why I believe that
some people say they always use two
coats of glue peel off base coat but
then you're gonna wait 20 minutes to put
base coats on your nail so that little
dingleberries won't come off
glitter should come off better you'd
think but it's not look at a glitter
itself has seemingly separated from the
glue duty that you see that like film
looking thing oh so freaky what's going
on and I didn't really enjoy how
unpredictable that removal process
seemed to be so I'm giving it a 6 out of
10 because I can last and spoiler alert
definitely least let's try yellow
stopper now yellow stopper is not
technically a peel-off base coat but
I've seen a few different nail polish
swatch people on Instagram say that they
always use it as
peel off base coat in between their
swatches so let's try it out and the
answer is it doesn't really remove does
it oh no this is not how things are
supposed to unfold this is not okay
looks like a bunch of jelly candies got
melted on my nails or something so I'm
not even gonna bother scraping them
because then I would literally be
scraping my nails let's try the multi
chrome and the same thing is happening
here I don't know if the base coat is
just not dry enough or if it made a
strange bond with the nail polish then
kind of melted it I think that's what's
going on here either way it shouldn't be
happening with any Bell off base coat
you use you shouldn't have to scrape it
off like this but then again yellow
stopper isn't supposed to be used as a
peel off base coat it's just a few nail
people have decided to be innovative and
try it that way but I give it a big
thumbs down this is gross
well this result means that I got to
bring back the dreaded acetone I use
some oil to help protect my skin but
basically this all defeats the purpose
of this whole goddamn experiment I'm
officially the worst scientist ever and
now only the tinfoil method will save my
glitter nail there's still some on the
sides of course do you see why people
don't like using acetone do you see you
see that white scale enos all over my
skin Oh gross you get a negative 5 out
of 10 for removal all right class it's
summary time here's the scores for all
eight peel off base coats in all four
categories overall force watchers the
award for best feel off base coat goes
to unta peel off base coat which also
happens to be the winner for the best
normal person peel off base coat
challenge now watch me go put my P Lee's
in a bag at the end of my other video
thanks for watching bye
