how do you how do you
oh well hello there hello everyone it's
me christine again and it's that time of
year where makeup artists on YouTube
everywhere upload upload more videos
than they usually do because it's hollow
week did you get it like hollow as an
hol Oh Mike holographic ring most magic
unicorn sex you got it good so I thought
to myself I've I've done a few makeup
videos just looks like dirt on my face
how did this happen to me I can do a
makeup video for Halloween to a lot of
you started suggesting that I do hollow
lips actual holographic glitter on my
lips not lipstick that changes colors
not the same so I went to the makeup
marketplace
I bought some hollow glitter shit and
I'm gonna put on my lusciously large
list I look like that Kermit mean when
he sits the teeth okay that's enough of
that let's get this party started
oh now we gotta put her hair back with
cat ears cuz Halloween truth be told I
wore these in the month of September
thank you I'm sorry so first you got to
do our face Oh what is that a makeup
artist of great nails this video will be
coming soon
hey look on the cat so I'm gonna speed
up the face part of the tutorial because
you've already watched my husband makeup
on your face video first right right and
it's very well explained in that video
so
so somewhere along the way I decided
that to look like a catch these
eyelashes kind of look like spiders so
it's fitting for the Halloween season
add this look with the ears and
everything is definitely original as oh
now it's time for the main event putting
some lips on my face oh do you know this
lips under there all right let's get
busy in my mouth so in my last lip
tutorial I didn't know that there was a
difference between lip liner and
eyeliner oh now I do get it see it says
lip liner I can read good tell me pencil
smells like wood so first we're gonna
over draw our tiny oh wow okay
we're going to over draw our tiny little
lips
I'm doing a very good job so it's gonna
kind of color then so it doesn't look at
that you're just in time she wants some
tea
how do I look nice cat ears thanks
do you like my lips thanks for the TV
bye
Oh now there's black on the straw cut
dammit okay where were we
this pencil isn't even that black it's
like Perret that's not bullshit so you
want to make sure you draw your lips
really evenly like I've done be honest
I'm not even sure why we need lipliner
I'm kind of just thinking it's a hoax
because it's so much harder to put on
lip liner straight and make it look good
so they do it to make you feel bad make
you have lower self-esteem so thoughts
on black liquid lipstick now are just
going o be already better much cleaner
her god I can't talk I'm sure Rara need
like one of those things that the
dentist that they put in your up to get
your saliva always so it so I can do
this properly shit don't say words with
P in them
oh yeah you guys like that too light
okay so you've got her or the lips
twitching now here P so you can see that
the lipstick is drawn over my natural
lip line that's the point okay so I
could have done a silver hollow glitter
lit what it is Halloween and it's that
time of year when we all want to look
like slutty badasses now I'm going to
take some glitter glue sounds will
called glitter primer and paint that on
my list
mm-hmm
this doesn't aim that I lists are going
to stick together
alright black olive glitter yeah that's
what I like so now that that's on the
outsides I'm gonna get creative and put
the lighter color in the middle so it's
like a song alright
oh yeah bitch it's this part of a gothic
hollow sexual lookbook all 2016
Freddie's love artists like not eat
Bangka like I'm pretty sure I eaten a
whole bunch of lipstick and glitter me
it's not the first time I've even hollow
glitter lip right there for you that's
real nice okay you know what I mean good
let's do the top and the lighter black
lighter black you mean gray don't you
you know that these makeup brushes that
I'm using were sent to me for free by a
makeup company as I saw on my face video
and was like oh we got a son or some
shit I know I thought it was a mistake -
this is pretty much my dream lip ever
get a lip surgery done I want them to be
permanently like this and I get some
hollow injections blings
now to complete the look I get shit off
our piece up and they don't show you
