today and they're hollow which means
that you'll be the life is a party but
before we get started I'd like to take a
quick break and ask why so much hate
YouTube like why so apparently people
think I'm actually super annoying like
really annoying like I know I like so
annoying and my voice is really annoying
and that I'm a dingbat and I've dealt
with my share of hate on Instagram trust
me and it's totally fine I don't care
what you guys say but I thought I would
give you a little instructional video
because it appears to me that some
people don't know how to operate their
own computers so the trick is if you're
highly annoyed by my voice in a video or
highly annoyed by any video if you're
using a PC that's a Windows computer and
you're not sure how to close the window
that the annoying video is playing in
just watch this video I've inserted this
very useful link for you alternatively
if you're using a Mac here's another
resource for you that shows you how to
close a whole bunch of windows at once I
really hope you guys take the time to
check out these random videos because if
you find me highly annoying then you
should probably just close this stupid
window now with that said no more
complaining and just look at this Hollow
look at this gold Hollow you look good
sparkly hollis everyone forgets my
annoying voice
they see this this is fun lacquer
million dollar dream and look at it it's
gold and Hollow and it's the best piece
of jewelry you'll ever wear and it's on
your nails which makes it even better
this is what boy should be buying you
instead of like stupid gold rings or
bracelets okay just tell them I really
want this gold to follow polish with my
fun lacquer and it's called million
dollar dream you can get it at the link
below and simply no logical is YouTube
video description so I always sponge on
my glitter polishes so I can get maximum
glitter payoff and to make the sponging
process a lot faster and easier if you
just cover up your finger with simply
peeled liquid latex barrier first look
it's dry when it sparkles and now my
nails are sparkly I can't tell the
difference let's just watch this again
oh yeah back in the bottle that's so
good so I'm adding it on a sponge
because the sponge actually absorbs the
clear jelly in the polish leaving more
glares behind now once upon a time like
in the Dark Ages I made a video on this
and it's highly embarrassing compared to
my current videos you can watch it there
if you really want to have a good laugh
and how terrible my video quality used
to be anyways that's where the original
idea came from so you can see as you
sponge it on the glitters sticked a lot
better and you've lost all of that
potentially lumpy clear jelly in the
polish itself because it went right up
into the sponges but sorry spongebob
peel off simply peel it peels so good
and then you basically have gold bricks
on your nails add a quick dry top coat
because we're gonna add nail vinyls next
and then let it dry for about 15 to 20
minutes so I'm using these stripes
skinnies as they're called nail vinyls
from twinkle t.com and you can use my
code simply for 10% off your entire
order and I'm gonna cut them in half so
I don't waste too many if I actually
only need a shorter version because this
is my goal okay this is what I need to
put on my nail so that I paint the
opposite of it black so it's actually
going to look like this one on the right
but the pattern is like the one on the
left so to make this twisted four
quadrant diagonal pattern thing I kind
of just like sketched it out on a piece
of paper first and planned it that way
and then thought okay let's try it on my
nails and there yeah I don't really know
what you call this shape but it's a
quadrant of some sort
who not purple hollow so I just fill in
the spaces of the gold now with a black
polish amazing pulped never mark and I'm
removing the vinyls as I go so that the
Polish doesn't dry too much and then I'm
still peeling the off the vinyls well
the Polish is as wet as possible I can't
take all the vinyls off yet though
because I still need like outlines
around the inside where I'm painting
more to stay until they're all done yeah
I can't explain this just watch it is
this where I get annoying when I'm
trying to explain things maybe I just
shouldn't explain things anymore clean
up any excess with an angled eyeliner
brush and acetone and add your final
glossy top coats you can really let
those hollow glitters shine and there
you got what looks like a kind of
quadrant paradox lying thing it's like a
super stylish bumblebee Navy this design
would also look epic with a silver
hollow glitter I recommend these ones as
worn by one of your favorite Russian
nail bloggers with epic photography
skills I think if you just put hollow
glitter on your nails you don't even
need to be Russian to take good pictures
just have the hollow glitter and have
some lights or even some sunshine and
bam you're Russian alright thanks for
watching and listening to me rant
please don't leave a comment about how
annoying I am and just teach yourself a
lesson and learn how to close the window</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
