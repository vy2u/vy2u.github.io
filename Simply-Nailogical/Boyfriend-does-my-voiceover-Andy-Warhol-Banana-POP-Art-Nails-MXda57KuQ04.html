am sick
I'm dying help you may have seen me
complain about this recently on social
media on my Twitter or on my snapchat
and if you haven't then now you know so
because I'm sick and I have these
excellent amazing Andy Warhol inspired
banana nails that may or may not have
been directly inspired by my boy friend
oh yeah that's a banana it's pretty good
yeah I mean let's be honest he did a
shitty job so I decided it was necessary
to make these but actually look good and
because no one wants to listen to me
talk for a few minutes
who better else to narrate this video
tutorial then my boyfriend Ben himself
take it away Ben all right hi everyone
no it's hallo
hello everyone uh you know I think I did
a pretty good job last time so yeah this
nail art these banana nails are of
course inspired by the Andy Warhol image
used on the cover of The Velvet
Underground &amp;amp; Nico record released in
1967 but of course you probably don't
care about that so let's just show you
how to get bananas on your nails so I'm
looking at a nail and you're gonna put
some color on that nail it's red you're
gonna use vibrant colors cuz you know
why would you want to be subtle uh and
you're using a brush to paint your nail
and you're painting the bottom of the
nail too I guess you're still painting
your nail
I guess you're painting your nail again
you're still painting your nail you're
spending a lot of time painting your
nail you're spending too much time
painting your nail
I like this isn't real right dude how
many times do you need to paint one nail
is this for real
all right now using a toothpick to
clutch your okay and now we're we're
peeling up a sticker and these exist so
these are banana vinyls you can find
them in the weight do these actually
exist or where they just made for us no
they're actually for sale okay so these
these exist thank you twinkle t uh these
are banana nail vinyls you can get them
at the link below and yeah you should
get them cuz why wouldn't you want fruit
shaped stickers for you what I'm doing
right now oh so okay so you put the
sticker on your nail and yeah you want
to leave the the exposed part of the
sticker so you can paint the negative
space that it yeah but you're sponging
on it's white you're dabbing whiteness
on to you sound like an old woman so
yeah okay for some reason you put a
bunch of white stuff on and now you're
painting yellow it looks the exact same
color as the sticker yeah so peel that
off and I mean it I think you put that
white stuff on for no reason because I
can see the yellow just I'm now you got
paint and what's on my other hand wreck
so here's some random nail polish that
has nothing to do with the video and
it's on my other hand and it
on your other hand it's on christine's
other hand and it's here's a shot of it
you should like this right I mean it's
sparkly you could probably get it at
some link that's somewhere below it's
hollow right look at that light Oh
hollow sexual hug is gratuitous brush
shots flashpoint it's probably some
weird music that's making your parents
look at you watching this on your phone
and now we're back to what we were here
for we got some black paint on a yogurt
lid Christine makes me save all the
yogurt lids in the house that's right
and now her out lighting the banana to
give it some detail giving it some old
spots so yeah we're we're just outlining
the banana adding some some black spots
you don't want your banana to be brown
or anything you know just just want it
to pop a little you got a you're using a
tiny little brush to do this do you have
a little brush if not I don't know what
you would do use your hair didn't you
watch my 20 nail art hacks
yeah I didn't see that what and taped to
my hair on to the end of it so don't put
on too much black stuff don't don't
don't over do the black you know did I
do too much you don't want like a moldy
old mushy banana here unless you're
making a banana bread you want like a
smoothie
by doing so now you're putting on a
clear clear thing to protect your
natural nail we're sealing the design to
add a beautiful shine are you sure it's
to add a beautiful design oh is it a mad
one yeah okay so it's it's it's it's a
matte topcoat then to give it to kind of
dull the the image and yet now if you
wait for your nails to dry and look
banana pop art nails aren't they
beautiful so many vibrant colors they're
nice to look at right this this is the
good thing about pop art actually it's
not pretentious like so many of the
other fine arts you can just kind of
enjoy them on a very visceral
superficial level you don't need to like
debate the deeper meaning of them are
talked about symbolism there they're
bananas on pretty colors enjoy them
or or don't just you know whatever
floats your boat whatever for whatever
floats your banana boat so uh yeah look
look at these banana nails we're seeing
a bunch of shots of banana nails and
yeah are you gonna put these on your
nails
maybe you should I don't know if you
want to you don't have to but you could
yeah let me know in the comments if
you're gonna put bananas on your nails
cuz that's probably a good idea I still
can't believe these actually exist it's
really you know a dream come true for me
like so thank you so much Twinkle t for
making this dream a reality so uh yeah
thank you so much for watching
should subscribe to this channel I
suppose if you want to keep on rockin in
the free world and and yeah give this
video a big thumbs outward do whatever
YouTube people tell you to do to their
videos she'll see y'all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
