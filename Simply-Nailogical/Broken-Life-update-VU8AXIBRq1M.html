video I've ever had to make on on
YouTube I almost didn't want to make
this video but I'm just going to say it
okay
I broke my middle nail on my good hand
I'm so disappointed nail brakes suck so
bad I know you guys know that some of
you have gone to them too but the thing
is like being in the public eye everyone
thinks my nails are perfect but they're
they're not always perfect when the
cameras aren't on I guess life isn't all
about unicorns and rainbows it broke so
deep and so suddenly and I I wasn't
expecting it I tried to fix it I really
did the hurt was this Trudy fight I
couldn't do it's like I just didn't cry
over my nails but I cry over my nails
because I just touched an emotional oops
I know I look like right now
don't mind me please
I have always shared my nails with you
guys so I feel like you deserve to know
what was really going on and I deserve
that
address me I know it's only been like
seven months since my last nail break
video so I'm kind of embarrassed about
it I crying all week about this I know
everyone wants to know what happened
what went wrong it just hurts too much
to relive it you know so I want to talk
about it right now
still very painful like like actually
though like it's killing it pulsating
like the skin was exposed I'm dying so
further so Melissa you know how Kim
Kardashian and JLo have their blood
insured I should have got my nails
insured why didn't I think of that
I beg you guys please don't hate on my
middle nail on Twitter on snapchat on
Instagram also make sure you're
following me on Twitter snapchat and
Instagram so you don't miss any shady or
bitter remarks oh my god oh my god we
went a little overboard with this that's
an ugly cry gonna eat my feelings yeah I
don't want to break your nail though my
heart is broken into a million Reese's
Pieces food and drink please
I'm just crippled and I don't know what
to do I feel stupid
I feel so stupid know what I hate more
than anything is that there's going to
be people who come to this video who
don't care about me or my name all they
care about is the drama and the sauces
and because me so sacked I wish I didn't
have to make this video but definitely
going to monetize it if there's any
advice I can give to another nail
artists out there is be careful no one
unload the dishwasher
don't open boxes don't make the bed
don't do chores don't clean don't even
wash your hair okay it's not orphan oh
you're always there for me no no no
leave me ready
you might try to look back at my old
videos of my long nails and try to
figure out where it all went wrong but
you won't be able to I don't know what
what happened what I'm thirsty
can I even call myself simply no logical
anymore simply broken on the inside
logical so where do we go from here I'm
going to try to regrow my nail and
regardless I'm going to continue to make
uplifting inspiring and positive content
on my channel and I'll decide when it's
time to make another video but when I'm
ready to move on but right now it's just
too hard you know might make a video
kind of like cliff fading you guys into
thinking my nail and I got back together
but I haven't decided yet
we'll see how I'm feeling do you think
this is a joke video don't you because
it's about my nail but I'm actually
really sad about it okay I'm gonna have
to go before I break another nail I need
breakdown again
so thank you guys so much for watching
this video please give it a like I mean
know if you're not subscribed to my
channel and please subscribe
yes it really helps out my feelings
thanks so much for watching I'll see
y'all later back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
