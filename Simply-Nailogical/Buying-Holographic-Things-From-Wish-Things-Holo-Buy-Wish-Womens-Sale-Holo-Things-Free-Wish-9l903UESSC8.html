Christine again don't you wish it was
someone else so several months ago I saw
my friend Sofia make a video about
buying things off wish and you can bet
that I smashed that like button
trimmer trimmer and ever since her video
you guys have not stopped asking me to
make a video but vine off wish and
then I thought to myself what the
is wish and where did it come from why
am I seeing so many ads for it
why is everything on wish so cheap how
can a website be profitable selling
items for one dollar and all that
thinking just made me more curious and
wanting to buy just for the
adventure so we've all seen videos about
buying outfits from wish wedding dresses
choose beauty products fashion hauls but
I don't really want any of that but
there is one thing that I do want and it
looks like they got a lot of it
but the important question is is it real
hollow or is it fake news today we find
out constantly illogical
okay so rewind a little bit shortly
after Sofia's video in July I filmed
myself ordering a bunch of hallo
off wish
well hello friends I wish for hallo
please yeah I was trying to go for this
apphia Morticia look shut up and then
almost every single item was refunded
for reasons still unknown to me I then
tried to reorder a bunch of some of
it got refunded again and by that time
some of the products weren't even the
same or the price had changed I didn't
understand did they not want my Canadian
money it's Hollow okay just say and so
after several attempts of ordering and
then things being randomly canceled on
me and then ordering again here we are
finally several months later and I have
a shitload of things from wish at least
I think these are from which none of
them actually say that they're from wish
number B 0 8 B 10 Chuck top car pack
quite tie bro customs declaration it's
all written in Chinese I don't know what
it says maybe it says drugs I wonder if
you could get drugs off wish if they'd
be like really cheap but also like maybe
not as good quality let's open them up
and see what we've got because I don't
remember what I ordered what is this
it's rolled in tin foil I actually think
this might be heroin don't ask me how I
know always nail polish okay we're gonna
save the nail polish for another video
leave a comment down below if you want
me to test nail stuff from which by the
way I'm fully aware that this video is
like several months late to the whole
YouTube wish fever thing but like you
gotta understand takes a long time
it's gotta come by boat from China to
Canada first and then once a giftie
candidate has to hop on a moose and
gallop on over to my house
I know these aren't hollow but I had to
get them for like obvious reasons
because this wet pants bitch honestly
I'm pretty amazed at how many things
with the word on it you can buy
from wish so I bought an extra small
because these are actually men's pants I
know why do guys get to have all the fun
why can't they make these for ladies we
can be savage - okay the black / gray
/white men's fashion printing casual
sport pants however I think they're
missing a very key descriptor let's try
them on then what do you think stupid
you know what then you I would have to
say that these aren't really sweat pants
like I would not call these wet pants
because they're so thin I think if I had
to write these pants I would say zero
out of ten sweat pants but still pretty
 cool okay what's the next this
is fun
oh my god I think it's real Hollow
woman's cool short skirt rainbow
holographic flash round skirt or it's a
bib either way I like this one wasn't
cheap this was twenty two dollars
Canadian okay that's expensive it's got
some weird like tablecloth material
underneath in fact if I flip it inside
out
it's a tablecloth let's try it on okay I
literally can't
welcome back where the do you wear
this skirt like if I wore it at this
height you would see my Hollow choco
aliexpress.com not like their competitor
or is it their supplier conspiracy oh
why did I buy these again I look like a
tool 2017 Funko metal vintage sunglasses
women glitter twinkle bling - in retro
you'll be seen punks oh my god what else
do we got the party just never ends oh
my god why is it so short I paid for a
full shirt not half the shirt that why
it says t-shirt teenagers t-shirts I
just wanna be like the cool kids all the
cool kids
I just wanna fit in looks like if
someone printed oh yeah exactly
false advertising oh my god it's like
falling apart all over me what the
all of these things just came from this
look what's next yes I have been waiting
for this item what female on the
internet today does not recognize this
exact jacket this jacket is the
quintessential jacket of wish so this is
the iridescent transparent jacket
holographic rainbow sheer tumblr grunge
90s fashion it's advertised as
holographic but I'm real hollow sexual
would note that this is just iridescent
I guess I don't have to worry about
mosquitoes because this is basically a
mosquito net what size did I get why is
it so big medium one size and I
understand I got a medium but the one
size maybe they only make medium in the
listing it looks like it's some kind of
plastic like a raincoat but in reality
it's much more of a very harsh abrasive
feeling mosquito net it just feels like
 my arms really itchy right now who
eat chocolate on my fake hollow jacket
maybe the underpaid child that probably
put that shirt together will speak about
that
later class stay until the end of the
lecture for $9 I can't say that I'm that
disappointed because that's pretty cheap
for a jacket but this seems like a
jacket that only Instagram models would
know how to make look good
hello it's not me because I do not
collaborate with wish to make this
holographic hallo it's me mobile phone
case for what the the
description is almost accurate except
they forgot to write stolen also it's
 fake hallo okay like what idiots
but I bet now they wish they didn't quit
simply bitch gonna smash that you'll be
hearing from my lawyers whoa what is
what is it oh it's a necklace beautiful
post fashion holographic choker rainbow
goth collar large Punk choker necklace
win it big collar jewelry there's collar
in there twice and one of them is
spelled wrong there's also choker in
there twice and one of them is spelt
wrong kind of looks like a bow tie and a
bit like I'm missing a tie that should
go right here what's next what's next
woo oh my god we got a silver hollow
side and we got a purple hollow side
fashion hologram big diamond shape mr.
bibliographic X crossbody chain big
night College number likes dong number
what $15 I think $15 for it that's not
cheap oh my god it came with free air
bonus you guys can't deny okay if you
saw this listing with that picture you
would have bought it too this backpack
is so cool I want to go back to school
and I'm 29
so technically I would label this
iridescent instead of holographic
because it's see-through whoa the world
looks so cool through this thing I'm
going to the hollow sphere okay what's
next
I thought these were gonna be hollow
new-fashioned Jen legging for winning
mermaid sales printed highway support
leggings fitness plus-size how is this
plus-size so these came in multiple
different colors and when you look at
the listing for the silver color the
picture so clearly shows that it's
holographic silver but it's not real
ha ha I am disappointed so hideous hey
once we leapfrog no all right last few
packages what is this very protective
packaging oh my god the shoes Oh bonus
says Chanel are supposed to make them
smell nice
who tried on these shoes first
she's didn't say hollow on the listing
but they caught my eye
for obvious reasons I'd say that these
are women's boot boot women's boots with
a black glitter and also some iridescent
glitter kind of sprinkled with it $30 oh
my god that's expensive why am i buying
like the more expensive things off wish
this like defeats the purpose of way so
the boots are cute yeah they're sparkly
they're pretty but they're so
uncomfortable they make me want to walk
off a cliff now I couldn't do a wish
Hall without getting something for my
boyfriend oh man man I'm good I don't
know
do you like it very good thank you get
to be a little more enthusiastic it's
very nice thank you Merry Christmas
don't you wish you look this good can I
go alright now it's time to show you my
final look
[Laughter]
alright guys what do you think I don't
know when I see stuff like this I can't
help to think that it was probably made
by people living in pretty terrible
conditions yeah
like if you're paying $5 for a jacket
how much money does the light shine
against her for that jacket in some ways
it's hard to be an ethical consumer in
2017 which is pretty daunting right like
we all have smartphones you own a
product that was made at least in part
by people who are working under
conditions that we would find just
disgusting from like a North American or
western or European that's the sad
reality when there's other markets in
developing countries that can make the
same product at a cost of a lot less
yeah but as people move over to those
markets to get the products made for a
lot cheaper so that their profit margin
is higher as consumers we can make some
obvious choices to maybe not support
companies that very clearly exploit that
reality the end of the day though wish
is just a vendor it's just a market
that's share these individual sellers to
put it on there so whether it was wish
or someone else this would be happening
actually that's a good point because all
the packages I got today we're all sent
from different vendors which doesn't
make them themselves they've kind of
come out of nowhere - no it's like
estimated they're worth a billion
dollars and whose fault is that at the
end of the day I'm not gonna judge
anyone for wanting to buy really cheap
stuff online right yeah and we have to
remember that for some people it's
actually a great deal for them to get
clothes maybe not clothes like this
these gonna be very practical I don't
really know what you have to lose if you
just spend like five dollars on outfit
maybe your credit card information when
you buy stuff off a platform like this I
think you have to expect that it's going
to be mostly garbage yeah or just not of
the highest quality let's say why is she
looking your head if you have this sort
of privilege or financial stability to
not have to buy five other clothes that
were likely made by people in terrible
conditions you know support local
businesses and but I think this is a
good point because I'm not sure that
everyone is aware or knows that that's
probably what's happening when you buy
like two dollar clothes off the internet
and it's not even fair of us to conclude
that all of these clothes were made yeah
we don't know for sure consumers stay in
the dark especially I think in North
America right because we don't see the
kinds of conditions where these were
possibly manufactured and if you wonder
why we've seen so many wish ads it's
because the company has spent millions
of dollars on advertising and they don't
even really have to make YouTube ads hey
this is not a sponsorship for wish let
me be very pretty well I'm glad we have
this top kids it's time for dinner now
go to your room do your homework and
write me an essay on globalization now
expect it at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning
I'm glad you're fun making this video
but I wouldn't encourage you to continue
this is shopping your friend these
things well I already have a whole other
bag of I already bought it so I
can't return it
if you guys want to see me test out nail
 from wish but promise me that
you're gonna think before you purchase
from wish then I'll make the video ah
