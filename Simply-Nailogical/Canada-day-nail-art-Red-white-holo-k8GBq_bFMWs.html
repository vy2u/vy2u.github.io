meanwhile everyone's like um what's that
so I've been seeing a lot of fourth of
July nails on Instagram lately and I'm
just sitting here up north thinking like
Canada is a country to a and we also
have a day
it's called handi today which is almost
as creative as calling it 1st of july
day so i start off with the white base
coat and you can watch my what's the
best white polish video if you haven't
seen it already where I test out 11
different white polishes to find which
ones are not like milk I've put the link
to the winning white polish challenger
in the description box below next I'm
going to apply some simply peel latex
barrier around my finger to protect it
from messy gradients you've never heard
this one before and I'm going to use
just two colors for the gradient color
club's French tip and color Club
red-handed which apparently smells like
cinnamon that's really unnecessary I
applied two thin swipes of each color
polish vertically down the sponge
because I'll be doing a vertical
gradient now this gradient is kind of
tricky and there's two ways of doing it
you could do it all in one go which
means red white red but then you
basically be blind or sponging
doesn't all run into pink or you can do
it my way where I've split it up so I'm
doing each red side separately so that
way I can better control where the white
and red is beginning and stopping right
away you'll see that the sponge already
has pink blended into it so between each
layer I just cut off part of the sponge
and went at it again with a fresh side
so that I could avoid anything kiss in
my red and white Canada Day nails see
how when you do the other side
separately it's easier to control where
the white is you don't want that white
to turn pink that's not a Canadian flag
not too long ago I tried to do something
similar with blue and mint so it looked
like this and then it looked like this
and then it ended up like that that was
like that looks so messy I don't even
know I never ended up posting it because
I kind of thought it was a fail but if
you guys want me to post it I will
eventually comment below let me know you
want to see you nail fail yeah you do
people love other people's failures so I
keep sponging until the red is deep
enough although I guess inevitable
pink somewhere peel off my simply peel
like no big deal but it really is a big
deal look how great his heel is this
heel is so much satisfying it's almost a
satisfying if the little iridescent
glitters
hidden in the simply peel add a quick
dry top coat and wait about 15 to 20
minutes for it to fully dry because next
we're gonna add nail vinyls twinkle tea
must know I'm Canadian otherwise they
wouldn't have sent me these Canadian
Maple Leaf nail finals because who else
in the world would actually use these
beside Canadians show your love to
Canada guys even if you're American you
can pick up these maple leaf vinyls and
use my coat simply for 10% off because
Canada loves everyone
isn't that right we're like super
friendly or something there's a matter
stereotype oh no it's that we live in
the woods and drink maple syrup I don't
live in the woods but I love maple syrup
so I'm actually going to do a reciprocal
gradient over this vinyl which just
means it's the inverse of color pattern
that I have on the base but in order to
get a sponge smell enough I got to cut
it sideways so I have this like tiny
little square section of a sponge and
then I'm sponging on colors in the
opposite direction as the base coat so
the red goes in the middle and the white
goes on the outside of I'll be perfectly
honest I had no idea how this is gonna
turn out but nail art is a risky
business guys it's gonna take critics
so when the colors are opaque and just
take your pair of tweezers and lift up
the edges of the vinyl thing then you're
going to peel it off slowly and it
didn't really yield perfect me I guess
that's because I was sponging on too
much but whatever add a glossy top coat
to make that Canadian gradient flag
shine because this is not with a
Canadian flag actually looks what I got
all its the nail art version looks cool
but it's missing something
what's the missing guys seriously though
what's it missing it's missing Hollow
obviously what is the stupid question so
I take my new favorite hollow topcoat I
put the link for it below and add it on
the Canadian flake because if Canadians
are anything it's sparkly
now I'm like a super Canadian flag I got
rainbows and gradients take that people
who invented the flag to measure the
plugin what if it was like nail artists
legs legs would be so much better and
the hollow was the perfect touch for my
candidate anus don't worry fellow
Americans I didn't forget about you
completely I'll probably do fourth of
July now and I know you all want to see
that
ways so how about you just comment if
you don't want to say July for nails
how's that now go tell everyone you know
happy candy today on July 1st and
they'll be like what the hell will
Canada and then you can point to a map
and say Canada is just north of us eh
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
