here and welcome to a nail tutorial
that's very practical to wear in your
everyday life I recently saw Mikey from
glam and Gor you know that awesome
channel that does stuff on her face that
us know people can never do do this
candy cane ice queen theme but all over
her face and her body and it was awesome
so I was like yes
I'm gonna put your face on my nails and
up my hand my nails are so vogue right
now they could walk down a runway we've
got an Onew mani cam we gotta own you
first we're gonna start with some hollow
glitter because if you didn't know
that's how all great things in life
begin if I only had a few hollows to
choose from I'd probably pick this
silver hollow glitter because everyone
needs a basic silver hollow glitter in
their collection not that silver hollow
glitter is basic but you know what I
mean now there's two ways you can put
this nail polish on your nails actually
there's three but I'm just going to show
you two the first way is for people who
don't have simply peel or a liquid latex
barrier but this requires a certain
amount of precision and skill you
applied the glitter on the narrow side
of a makeup sponge and then just dab it
on your nail very carefully trying not
to put it all over your skin using a
makeup sponge is the best way to apply
glitter on your nail because the sponge
will absorb excess jelly leaving more
glitters behind which is what you want
you want to maximize that glitter
I bet makeup artist be like why are you
using a makeup sponge on your nail and
we'd be like well why are you sucking on
a piece of plastic not my key though
she's actually quite a normal person and
isn't that vain or stupid she made a
video on why this lip trend is actually
a terrible thing you should go watch it
it's really insightful so anyways this
method takes some time because you got
to concentrate real hard to try not to
get it all over your finger method
number two is with simply peel or
another liquid latex barrier and it's
best for people who are lazy or messy
lazy people are usually messy though
so either way apply simply peel around
your nail to protect your skin and then
you can use whatever size makeups once
you want add the silver hollow glitter
and sponge that on everywhere it
doesn't matter you got a shield so this
method is a lot faster to reach maximum
glitter opacity and then you just peel
off simply feel like no big deal when
you're done and then I just add a quick
Drive topcoat because at the time I was
thinking about what I was gonna do next
and sometimes I don't always know so I
had a quick dried topcoat while we wait
now my real challenge in making this
tutorial was how the hell was I gonna
make those badass icicles snow things
that Mikey had all over her face
she used a glue gun but I don't have one
of those what do you think I do regular
arts and crafts no just my nails so I
thought I know what helps get stringy
and clear yeah old topcoat I just
randomly strung the old topcoat across
my new uber mat which I got from uber
chic beauty and I put the link below in
the video description box but then I was
taking too long and I was annoyed so I
just poured out the rest of the bottle
of topcoat and started turning it across
like that look at all of my icicles I am
the ice queen but my kind of ice is ice
that sparkles so I just take some
glitter dust that has a nice green
iridescent shimmer to it and dig up that
cocaine for fairies I dusted over the
top coat and I hope the top coat is
still wet at this point probably not
with my luck it probably dried already
it wouldn't be a simply no logical
tutorial without me doing this a few
times and obviously the fairies made a
huge mess after their KO party and it
took like three hours to clean up and
Ferries just leave that icicle mess
aside for a minute and we're going to go
back to our nails I'm going to make some
candy cane stripes with some nail vinyls
I got from twinkle tea and just randomly
placed them so it looks like a candy
cane makes sense
yay I just took a random red Essie
polish that's not hollow I know so
boring and used it to paint over the
stripes in because the polish isn't
completely opaque you do kind of see the
hollow glitter shine through from
underneath to avoid the vinyls getting
crusted in I like to take them off as I
go because remember the red nail polish
should really be as wet as possible when
you peel off the vinyl so you don't get
any weird stragglers more hollom are so
unnecessary but so Nessa
sorry I took some red hollow glitter I
caught from Twinkle t and I just added
another stripe down the red stripes
because I can never get enough this red
stripe had dried by now so I had to use
a clear nail polish to get it a little
sticky and these look great I mean
awesome nails for the holiday season I
could stop here but I'm not a normal
person back to the home made sparkling
icicles I thought these were gonna snap
and break the second I tried to pry them
up with the tool but they actually held
together pretty good since your nails
are nowhere near the size of your
shoulder or your head you can just cut
up the little bits of icicles to size I
say that like you're gonna do this and
at this point I was just brainstorming
how the hell this is kind of work and
how it's gonna look on my hands hey
remember when I did the bloody trips for
Halloween all up my hand it's like the
same amount of crazy but a different
holiday so it's pretty much impossible
to escape glitter going everywhere so
just accept it make it part of the look
and now I look at some Swarovski bling
and that can only mean one thing I'm
gonna put some more sparkly objects on
my nails the best thing to pick up
Swarovski crystals is the crystal katana
because it has a wax tip head thing that
holds the crystals really well without
leaving any gross residue behind I made
another video demonstrating how it works
and how awesome it is and you can use my
code simply for 10% off the crystal
katana just like you can use my code
simply for like a million other stores I
can't even keep track anymore but hey at
least it's easy to remember I'm applying
a topcoat again over this just to make
my nail sticky enough to stick down to
little crystals you could use nail glue
to make it last longer but I was kidding
when I said this was a practical nail
look that you should wear for a while
actually you could totally pull off this
look in real life even the sparkles all
over your skin everyone will just think
you're amazing but we gonna go from
amazing to the candy cane ice queen
bitch so next I'm just going to take
some simply peel and slap it all over my
finger because in all honesty I had no
idea how to append these icicles to my
skin so first things first protect
yourself kids except I realized later
that just using simply peel as an
adhesive doesn't work at all because the
latex is not sticky when it dries I'm
sure Mikey or another makeup artist
would know what to do but I'm a nail
artist so I'm just gonna play
and sprinkle some more glitter all over
it before it dries yes you can never
have enough ever so I go back to my
dried icicle sheets and I'm like hey
what are you doing there get out of
there you little what can I say
glitter is attracted to glitter chop it
to size if you haven't already I already
did I just wanted to show you a second
clip of this because it looks so cool
look at this so I ended up using clear
nail polish on the back of the Icicle
thingies to adhere it to my skin makeup
artists everywhere are laughing at me
right now I do happen to know though
that you probably shouldn't be putting
nail polish on your skin but in this
case I've slathered my skin and simply
peel so it's fully protected but it
needs more guys help me I can't stop
putting more glittery stuff on this nail
design I need a finger / hand design so
I cut an it on timorous where I'll see
crystals yeah I just made up a verb I
cut an ad you bitch I don't even care if
I pronounced that wrong now I'm a coal
tar bitch with glitter and shimmer and
it was on my fingers I'm else's
nightmare oh that's right most of you
are 12 so you probably don't know that
song and that's the final look folks you
got a candy cane ice queen look going on
on your nails / hands this is just a
little bit of a stretch from the candy
cane nails I did last Christmas
what is that there's not even any hollow
you get out I think it's safe to say
I've grown as a nail artist and as a
person who's discovered their hollow
sexuality well I hope you guys enjoyed
this extreme avant-garde bug so
high-fashion candy cane ice queen look
and thank you to Mikey for inspiring
this look and also for inspiring me to
choose the song I chose yes I copied
that too and now we're going to have
some simply peel porn because that is
the most satisfying part about doing
these nails is taking them off because I
get to simply feel so much more than
usual
yeah that feels so good coming off I'm
telling you let's do it again and again
oops
don't worry crisis averted I wonder if I
can save these nails and actually wear
them in real life now sort of and I
shall end this tutorial in the graveyard
of simply peel icicles and glitter may
they all rest in peace
well have a happy holidays and see y'all
next time back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
