you about to watch these nails are for
Movember which is an initiative meant to
raise awareness for men's health such as
cancer in other words it's when lots of
men who don't normally wear mustaches
wear mustaches but let's not talk about
cancer or men's mustaches because
neither of those are cute but my kitty
men she is cute yeah and I made
mustaches out of her fur because I am a
crazy person step 1 find your
unsuspecting cat or any cat and attack
her with a hairbrush for Eliminator
thingy make sure you're gentle because
no cats should be harmed in the making
of this nail art in fact my cat is
probably really enjoying this tutorial
right about now hey mom I'm really not
sure what you're doing to me but I
really like it so can you keep doing it
please I don't understand it feels so
much better than your nails what is
going on in this world
oh yeah mom get my head get my head yeah
I get with a scratch behind my neck -
yeah really like that cuz I took my
collar off again you're gonna have to
let me lay down for a minute I can't
take it the joy is so intense one tip
don't let your cat eat her own hair or
even doing you stupid cat you want a
hairball or you dumb another thing you
should do is make sure you get a good
distribution of all the different colors
in your cat's coat I just cultivate a
little more white hair from her thigh
area whoever where we go now men Chi
this is not supposed to be that kind of
tutorial no once you've gathered enough
hair you can now move on to step 2 in
this tutorial which actually involves
painting your nails I'm applying an easy
peel off base coat I put the link in the
video description box for you because I
know I'm gonna want to get this off
ASAP and yes my nails are yellow if
someone tells me that again I will punch
something in the face ooh pretty pink
shimmery polish to distract me from said
violins shine brighter
of to explore wanderlust by nail decor
do you think she made that little rhyme
thing on purpose haha so clever this is
one of the new picture polish bloggers
collab polishes and I put a link to them
at the video something in the
description box and words escape me
today I used it as the base of this mani
because it's so pretty and pink and it
has like a shimmery glass Fleck in it
and just love that and because I'm
supposed to be portraying men'she in
this video with a moustache so I thought
that the bright pinkness would contrast
the moustache masculinity sorry I just
watched a youtuber who is impersonating
beauty gurus and now I think I'm doing
it by accident now that your nails are
all pretty and shimmery and pink just
like you take a few minutes to stare at
that beautiful shimmer we got work to do
shut up about your pretty pink
 take a dotting tool and dip it in
some white polish I'm using Color Club
French tip as always and I made some
really big eyes ooh
impromptu nail porno oh yeah that shift
that glorious shimmering green okay so I
have this green polish from fun lacquers
Christmas collection and it's just like
my cat's eyes so it's perfect
so I just take a smaller dotting tool
and I put the eyes in the middle and I
didn't mean for her to look this
cross-eyed but it just happened next up
take some black acrylic paint and a tiny
tiny tiny tiny nail brush because we're
painting tiny things I like to test my
painting skills out on a yogurt
container lid first to confirm that I
still don't have any now the goal here
is to paint some cute little eyelids and
eyelashes yet to make it look just a
little more feminine but clearly my hand
is shaking
I swear though all my other nails other
than the one I filmed always look way
better because it's so much easier to
paint little small things on your nails
when you don't have to do it for the
camera it's like I have performance
anxiety or something lay those lashes
mention a girl now I'm drawing some
abstract pointy ear things and I screwed
up because that's
and I just realized I'm such an idiot I
didn't put on a quick dry top coat
before applying this acrylic paint crap
so I can't just wipe it off so I have to
cover it up again with pink polish
because there's no control-z in life
while I'm letting that dry I'm just
gonna make the other ear more defined
and on fleek okay let me do this again
I'm shaking Jinyoung oh my god I can't
do from this angle okay let's just
pretend that I wanted the ears to be
asymmetrical on purpose I added another
white dot thing in the middle of the
eyes cuz I don't know and now the fun
part you've all been waiting for yeah
making moustaches with cat hair yes it's
a new trend I'm telling you just wait
for it so the best way to do this is to
just take out a little fluff it of hair
and then you're going to put it in your
palm wet your other finger with your
saliva and then roll it back and forth
on the palm of your hand so you can get
this nicely perfectly packaged cute
little bundle of Harry joy then you're
gonna take it and bend it in half to
give it that cute mustache shape now you
can trim the mustache if you want cuz
it's kind of long and you can do it like
the old school and just chop it right
off but that doesn't look really natural
now does it or you can take scissors and
kind of give it this nice feathered or
tapered look like your mother's
hairdressers might do on her head and
welcome to mustache city where there's
no boys but kittens are pretty now to
secure the mustache to the bottom of
your nail I'm just going to stick it on
after putting on a glossy top coat
because I really don't want to use nail
glue because I don't want to sell my
nails forever just take a pair of
tweezers and press it down gently on the
tip of your nail while the glossy top
coat is still wet hold it down there for
a minute or two and bam you a kitten
Canoe now you got to repeat that on all
of your nails because if you don't the
other kittens will be like hey why am I
not a man why don't I get a mustache yet
yeah okay fine my cat man she is a girl
but whatever gender doesn't matter to
cats I mean right
isn't that so respectable kitten
equality for all
now I'm mustache you a question
haha granny today I can't breathe would
you ever do these nails it's not such a
stupid question of course you wouldn't
if you do these nails you a are a
completely insane person or B you're my
best friend let's hang out sometime okay
and now I just got to remove these nails
so easily with my favorite feel off base
coat which I did put the link in the
video description box down below for you
there I got that sentence right this
time good job Christine I have these on
my nails for like 30 minutes enough to
take a couple pictures so that's why
it's not peeling off in one go because
it's still a little bit wet like the
topcoat has a little bit of moisture
still in it okay well this looks like a
scene out of The Walking Dead except
with cat zombies thanks so much for
watching this tutorial I hope you
enjoyed it and if you didn't then you
probably are a stuck-up bitch with a
stick up your butt and I would advise
you take it out and have a little fun
before you die see y'all later bye bye
