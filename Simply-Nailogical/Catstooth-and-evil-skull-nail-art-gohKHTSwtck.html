that are perfect for Halloween but also
perfect for the rest of the year first
let's look at some nail porn of this new
red shimmery glass Fleck amazingly
beautiful polish that I got from my
favorite nail shop link down below made
by picture polish this is Arabian never
forget who you truly are
I know I kind of think this Nepal should
just be called Canadian then this polish
was made in collaboration with my fellow
bloggers doodling IDO Lane is a highly
talented French blogger and you should
go check her out because I love her I
don't even know how you would describe
this magical rich red color it's like
they stole Scarlett Johansson's
signature red lipstick and mixed it with
a bunch of tiny pieces of glass look at
that it's pretty much opaque in one coat
holy praise the Lord but it is a
little bit see-through so I'm going to
add a second coat just to be safe and
because this polish is like a dream I
want to put it on glide so smooth oh yes
so shiny I love it oh yeah look at that
gloss it's so elegant and sophisticated
and nothing like me I guess so we're
gonna break that up with some badass
black shaped things so first we're going
to take a tiny tiny detail brush and
we're going to dip it in our black
polish and we're gonna freehand those
little shapes on our nails
wait you kidding me I can't
paint that we're gonna use nail vinyls
of course yes
got these houndstooth pattern now - from
twinkle to my number one favorite nail
tool store I'm adding a quick dry top
coat because we're gonna add new vinyls
next yeah lots of you have pointed out
how I say that a lot yep that's pretty
much in my permanent vocabulary
sometimes when you peel the vinyls off
the little pieces get stuck on the
inside so just put it down on another
piece of paper to peel oh it's not
working is it no okay let's try that
again on the other side just press it
down and peel it back and yeah I'm still
not much help to you today am i okay
there we go we did it we got all the
little pieces out all right so put that
down on your nail press it down firmly
we're gonna paint over top of it with
this black hollow glitter oh my God look
at that reverse action oh my god never
had a nail polish orgasm this is it oh
oh my god drip everywhere all over me
this is probably one of my top favorite
hauls of all time you can find it in a
list of all my favorite hauls I put a
link in the video description box it's
mint you favorite Polish website its
name is neutrino and as the day of
making this video its sold out oh my god
what do I do those two guys they tease
you and then leave you well it'll be
back in stop eventually I'm sure so you
can get your satisfaction on soon peel
up the vinyl carefully I like to lift
each edge so it comes off a little
easier and doesn't put the black stuff
everywhere
 oh that was so close guys
because I'm wearing a feel off base so
that's why I gently lift it it has
nothing to do with a vinyl and
everything to do with I'm a risk taker
and like to wear a feel off base coat
but more nutrino on because it's so
satisfying to watch yeah look at those
multicolored rainbow hollow glitters
popping through a black hole of wonder
all right let's hope we have better luck
feeling this one off oh I think I'm
in trouble
ah kidding me right now I don't
even have like an edge to pull it off
with oh my god how am I gonna get out of
this I mean I've read this whole thing I
hate this part so much effort for one
manicure oh my god it hurts holy
did that just happen did I just save
that okay I'm officially the new dr.
Derek Shepherd because that was some
brain surgery like I've never seen
before I'm just gonna consider myself
lucky in this episode where I didn't die
okay so that's a houndstooth pattern but
now we're gonna make it a cat's tooth
pattern because why cats are more fun
than hounds I got this idea from Tammy
aka oh my gosh polish you may know her
from Instagram or YouTube I put a link
to her original video on cat's tooth on
the screen and down below so by putting
little white dots it kind of makes it
look like each little shape is the shape
of a cat so the cats have eyes and they
have little ears on top of them how cute
is that right is really making cats to
cuddle because what used to be a tooth
is now the entire cat so abstract cats
houndstooth whatever you want to call it
it looks cute to me before I add the cat
eyes on my
so now I'm just gonna add a quick dry
top coat first cuz I'm going to put on
another nail vinyl skull nail vinyls
equals poison I love this one being a
bitch it doesn't want to come off nicely
either while I struggle I'll just remind
you guys that you can get all the nail
vinyls you want from twinkle chicom and
use my code simply for 10% off I can't
promise you that you'll have a smooth
problem-free experience but hey we'll
just struggle together then using my
favorite one coat or white nail polish
the link is below along with a video on
what's the best white polish to fill in
the skull head so it's really important
to use a good white when you're putting
white over top of the design or Pinal
like this cuz you don't want it to look
milky no it's got to be real white bone
oh yeah look at that removal that was
safe and sound
whoo alright now I'm making the hounds
that are still showing look like cats
something's missing I think these cats
need a mouth yes let's put some of this
red shimmer on their mouths now
they're kind of looking like evil bats
or little monsters that are possessed
with rabies and are drooling blood and
well whatever this is a Halloween
manicure I'm pretty sure that skulls at
least have eye sockets if not eyeballs
so I'm going to make one with a really
oversized dotting tool yes your eyes are
bloody because I made them so which is
also missing like little dots in his
eyes so let's just use the black hollow
glitter to make those dots
you're welcome skull because now you got
eyes ever been Bo alright um I think
skulls also have mouths so let me try
and free end
my god is my worst regret ever but let's
pray everyone playing oh can you draw a
tiny mind Christine can you do it
without messing up everything holy
I'm shaking okay okay okay okay stop
we're good OOP finally add a glossy top
coat over everything because you want
the sparkle to remain sparkly do make
sure you let the whole mani dry for
about 15 minutes before you apply a
topcoat or else you're gonna bleed all
those little eyeballs everywhere and bam
you one hell of a badass according to
your nails kinda looks like a logo of a
nail gang or something you know like the
Bloods and the chips maybe we're the
Bloods the chips are losers
now Red's not usually my kind of color
but damn girl I feel good in this I do
have one super Halloweeny nail art
coming up for you so not to worry it'll
be way more extreme than this one stay
tuned until then see you next time bye
