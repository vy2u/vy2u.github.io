of unicorn pee if you haven't yet be
sure to click on my face to learn there
will be a test it's now time to take an
in-depth look at the Unicorn fee and
what makes it so magical let's watch
some unicorn pee in action what do you
say oh yeah you want to get your milk or
not don't ya
unicorn pee is a sheer buildable highly
saturated shimmer equipped with
multi-faceted pigments that travel
across the color spectrum ranging from
green to yellow to gold to orange to red
to purple to Oh take me now unicorn how
is my attempt at a sexy voice what do
you mean you're not sexually attracted
to nail polish alright people of YouTube
let's get down to it first of all yes my
nails are yellow thank you yellow is the
color of sunshine please watch this
video if you're getting ready to comment
that I should clean my nails because I
don't need to clean them they're not
dirty the only thing that sturdy here is
the look of one coat of unicorn pee on
my nails as you may or may not know
unicorn key is very very thin and
formula in fact it's kinda useless to
wear by itself as I've discovered one
coat looks like red dirt
two coats looks like when your periods
just started - the shimmer three coats
is okay but there's still a couple bald
patches it's like when your dad's
beginning to get old and he's in denial
that there's bald patches on his head so
add a fourth coax what I really wanted
was to see what unicorn pea looks like
completely opaque but the answer is it's
not an opaque nail polish that's just
like not how it was made accept it and
move on I add a glossy top coat so I can
make those sparkles even sparkly er now
this is where the magic happens kids
when you take a light and you angle it
all the way over to the side and you get
this like yellow far-end stretch of the
rainbow and you move the light around
and magical things happen on camera
well this polish is so trippy your eyes
are playing tricks on you now I'm just
kidding I use the stabilization effect
too much in my editing software and my
hands just look retarded look at that
shimmer and shift you can kind of see
reaching all the way to green and then
it goes all the way back to a bright
magenta purplish red color
all right so that's four coats of
unicorn peace majestic are not so
majestic you beat the judge
now let's try unicorn pee over black
nail polish because black is the new
unicorn pee or unicorn pee is the new
black
I don't know how is that supposed to go
again and that's just one coat over
black ladies and gentlemen yeah I said
gentlemen I know you're out there
tuning in to some late night nail porn
don't worry I won't tell your wife oh
hello there shifting mix shifty you can
see that shifty transition reach all the
way to super bright green like my nails
are the Hulk or the Green Goblin
whichever one is more badass you choose
oh yeah I'm definitely feeling this
color combo oh it's so beautiful over
black I'm going to die dead that's it
died on deceased
let's try it over a bright royal /
cobalt blue just for fun because we have
fun this channel here's one coat of P /
blue I think I'm drowning in a magical
ocean added two coats cuz yeah I don't
know it just wasn't as potent as over
the black nail polish in fact I know it
looks terrible for yellow like I did on
these fire nails so I guess it has
something to do with the darkness of the
base coat you choose piece of advice
only layer this over dark colors the
light of the base coat the less you will
see the color shifting ways of the
unicorn pea and probably the dirtier it
would look I imagine this would look
absolutely terrible / white the shift is
definitely not as apparent over oil blue
as it is over black but you don't really
get that neon bright green action going
on at all oh shit guys look at my
background it's gold Hollow poster board
all of a sudden I just forgot what this
video was about
so do I even like this polish I don't
know but you could probably maybe find
out what I'm thinking if you watch my
other video on the official history of
the unicorn pea for now here's some more
of my face well I want to be a unicorn
she's like fully asleep but I'm holding
her this is the world's most tolerant
cat say bye everyone subscribe to our
channel so I can go to college thank you
very much Mon amigo that was a yes
