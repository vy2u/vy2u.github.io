and today I've got for you some actual
nail art yay that's right I did nail art
on my nail Channel please clap with me
so I'm not alone today we're going to
break some boundaries and we're gonna do
some nail art that actually looks good
that isn't stupid but of course it's
hollow and it's very fitting for the
fall season I'm so fashionable with my
nails do you see how I'm on trend with
Argyle that's that's in style right now
right today I am so hollow happy to be
sponsored by super chic lacquer to show
off their new 8 piece holographic Fall
collection you may recall a few months
ago I played with another one of their
one kotor linear hollow collection and i
just about died so naturally i was happy
to be satisfied all over again you too
can be satisfied with hollow let's warm
cozy fall season by clicking the link
below in the video description box how's
that for a sales pitch are you horny for
hollow yet
I would say that most of the collection
does fully cover in one thick enough
coat but I think these two slightly
lighter colors are a little on the sheer
side so you're probably gonna need two
coats but hey what do you expect these
are the colors of an angel I get a link
just face 90 swatch video of this
collection down below because she does a
great job about showing how they apply
on the nail unlike me because I am lazy
oh my god guides it's a hollow pumpkin
spice latte alright let's jump right
into the nails I'm starting off with the
peel off base coat because there will be
peel porn but it will only beat on my
snapchat because I wore these nails for
like a week and didn't want to take them
off snap squad knows what up let's start
off with the dark eggplant II hollow
purple base oh that is so rich feel like
a royal yep I would call that a 1 Co
wonder except I've I was I got drunk on
the hollow and put it all up whose touch
of my skin and now we're gonna paint
this really detailed argyle print on our
nails if you're new to my channel
welcome
um I don't actually know how to freehand
paid anything so I'm just gonna show you
how I cheat that system I find them okay
enough at free-handing if I have some
kind of guidelines already on my nails
to then trace or follow so that's
exactly what we're gonna do by making
some sticker strips of nail polish into
the shape of the diamond the best
results I like to use one of my nail art
mats and some straight nail finals
because it makes the edges really clean
when you peel them off gonna do it with
the green now I know these don't look
like diamonds yet you smartass I know
they are long rectangles don't worry
geometry class will save us we're gonna
make some diamonds out of long
rectangles it's amazing
I know sometimes if you put just the
nail polish on the mat alone it can be a
bit brittle when you try and peel it up
so I like to add a thin layer of clear
polish on top when that's dry it's time
to peel now you're going to take a pair
of tiny scissors cut off the edge on a
slant or if you're like me just
fine cut it straight and it will turn
out slanted and just like that you have
near perfect diamonds repeat many times
beautiful custom shapes by Christine now
we basically got to stick them on our
nails and to do that you just add some
clear polish or topcoat whichever make
the nail a little bit sticky and then
stick it on it's quite simple just don't
put it in the wrong spot because then
it's really hard to move it around after
that so make sure you place it correctly
the first time don't worry about the
little bits of clear polish that are
sticking out of the diamonds on the
sides they're all gonna disappear when
we cover everything in a glossy taco now
I'm just taking my trusty cleanup brush
dipped in a bit of acetone to melt the
clear polish off the edge now add more
diamond so make your nail a bit sticky
with some clear polish press down the
diamond and the other one on the side of
your nails it's a little bit trickier
because you're gonna have to do some
surgery to remove the excess so look at
me go I'm I'm basically qualified to be
a surgeon look at look at that precision
repeat on the other side until you've
covered your entire nail in beautiful
perfectly shaped diamonds the secret to
making this kind of technique work and
not having it look clumpy asfalt
is to make use of that cleanup brush
dipped in acetone to really melt the
edges and meld everything together
there's a couple more nail art steps but
first just to show you how you seal it
all in I'm gonna use my favorite glossy
taco of all the glossy tacos in the land
and I don't mean talk about if you are
ever wondering which glossy taco I'm
using in all my videos that works so
well it's this one I put the link below
been using it for well over six months
now and it's all that I ever use because
it is that good I like my tacos nice and
thick and glossy okay and I like it when
it dries really quickly because if you
know me I love my nail vinyls and I want
that to dry faster so I can get to
work speaking of work let's not get
distracted by these really satisfying
fascinating bubbles in the taco now we
got to make our Argyle nail sweaters
even more pretentious and preppy by
taking a striping brush dipped in some
pumpkin spice latte hollow that's not
what it's called but that's what I'm
calling it and because I already have
the dime
is on my nails it's a lot easier to know
where the line should go down the middle
don't it up Christine don't it
up so if you would like to paint
straight lines on your nails make some
stickers of straight lines put them on
your nails first and then paint straight
lines on your nails after you put them
yeah anyways now we're gonna go all out
like Blair Waldorf and add some
beautiful stitching using just a bit of
white acrylic paint and hopefully a
steady hand
is it a hot mess bag is it the
Balenciaga but how do you say that bad
nope it's just my nails looking like
Argyle all swaggity swag and and on
trend hopefully now it's my favorite
part all over again oh yeah we get to
seal it all off and a thick glossy taco
um that shine porn gets me every time
and there you have it
I have reminded everyone that I am
somewhat of a nail artist I think this
color combination turned out flawless
for fall and I can definitely see this
pattern or maybe a plaid design working
with the other colors in this collection
because super chic is an indie brand
they tend to sell out really quickly so
if you wanted some of these colors from
the Fall collection you got to get on
that girl click the link below getting
befouled again if you do something
inspired by me including nail art and
other stupid video ideas don't forget to
tag me on social media so I can see
especially on Twitter that's where I see
the most because that's where no one
follows speaking alright guys thanks so
much for watching and I gotta let you
know that there's not gonna be another
video for a week because the next one is
gonna take me a while to edit but don't
worry because let's just say it's gonna
come out with a bang
see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
