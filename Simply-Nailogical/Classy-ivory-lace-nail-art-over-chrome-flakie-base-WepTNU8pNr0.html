totally outside of my usual nail art
stuffs that's fine everyone's got to try
something new once in a while right so I
was inspired by this Sephora makeup bag
I've had for a while lying around and I
don't really have her wear makeup so
it's kind of useless I just had to reach
for my fun lacquer payday which is a
chrome flaky with hollow it's so pretty
look at it it's like mirrors on crack
after a violent fight with the Sun so
you've seen me use this creamy weird
stuff I'm putting around my finger
before and you can watch this video on
my review of all the latex peel-off
products this time I'm using simply peel
one of my faves so I apply it around my
nail so back in the dark ages of my nail
video career I made a video on glitter
polish payoff and basically showed how
to maximize opacity of glitter polish by
applying it onto a makeup sponge that
will absorb excess clear jelly or
whatever color the jelly is and leave
behind more glitter or in this case
flickies sponge all the figis and all
the glitters and then after I'm done my
slicky sponge fest I just peel off
simply peel like the mess didn't even
happen you don't have to add a quick dry
top coat here but I do for two reasons
one because it makes the nail smoother
to paint detail on and two because it's
easy to rub off if you make mistakes so
this is just some brownish acrylic paint
I got from the local craft store and
some white acrylic paint I'm trying to
match that weird ivory color lace on the
bag so I just take a little Brown and
mix it in to try and get the same color
as the bag ooh science chemistry I don't
know so I bought this really fine detail
nail art brush the JNA dance 24
something and I got it because I see all
these fantastic amazing realistic nail
art painters using it and I just thought
to myself if I just had that brush then
I could just paint exactly as awesome as
they can but it's not working why isn't
this working I'm not painting these tiny
little fine details it's not working I
don't
I want my money back it looks like I
just drew like a button and a couple
weird lopsided bows that I'm trying I'm
really trying so once upon a time in my
olden days I also made a quick trick on
how to get smoother lines for painting
so you can click on this link right here
it'll take you to my oil and a nail art
brush hack so can you tell yet that I'm
a fraud that I can actually paint small
detail like all the other nail artists
in the land yeah whatever it's okay I
just do gradients an abstract err and
pretend I can paint so I just double up
on some of the acrylic paint spaces so
that it's filled in so I realized that
before you actually let the acrylic
paint dry if you just take a little
toothpick and start to pick out the
little pieces where you kind of went too
far or you do too much or got a little
paintbrush happy you can actually pick
them off and make the lines more clear
kind of just shaves off the paint and
you can just brush it off when you're
done so there you go a little trick for
people who actually can't paint and I
think I'm done here my wrist is tired
okay
add a nice glossy top coat to make those
flakies and Hollow shine and there you
go you look like you go out and actually
flashy mani that's life appropriate I
would say well thanks for watching and
stay tuned for my next video on how to
pretend to be a nail artist
