ninja is I would sent this really smart
invention that picks up crystals really
easily it's called the crystal katana
and it's made by crystal ninja
that's the coolest company name ever you
can find their products on crystal ninja
calm it's basically a pen like utensil
that's made out of wood and it has a wax
tip that makes it super easy to pick up
Swarovski crystals gems or other
rhinestones without leaving any gross
waxy residue behind more on that later
so first I'm going to start with the
bling the fuck out accent nail someone
recently commented that I was like the
badass version of cute polish I like
that that sounds about right
I'm good with that if you are paint your
whole nail black and now become
mesmerized by some pink holographic year
hollow polish of course it's color
gloved miss bliss little miss bliss
better have her game face on tonight
because she's going to be rivaled by the
one and only Swarovski crystals I
painted all my other nails except for
the accent nail with this pink hollow
apply a quick dry top coat onto your
pink hollow nails because we're gonna
add nail vinyls on top of those later
for now let's overdo it with some light
filters and talk about the crystal
Catana tool so when I first got this in
the mail I was pretty impressed I mean
look at that packaging it came with the
cool workplace matte
rolled out the carpet for you let's try
that handle fancy pen trick failed so
what do we got here I got the crystal
katana tool in a case an instruction
booklet thing for ASCII crystals in the
mat the mat has one hell of a badass
chick on it and she even tells you what
the mat is for I don't know what
material you would call this kind of mat
but it reminds me of a mousepad it's got
a little grip to the bottom of it which
is nice so it won't fly it around one
you're working and now I know how to
glue like a ninja wait no I don't I
should probably read the instruction
booklet crystal ninja Oh hugs used to be
ugly until I saw these stem kicks toe
stick dubs speaking of cars the girl
behind the crystal katana who's actually
a ninja I was trying to be in the
Guinness Book of World Records for the
most number of Swarovski crystals added
to a car I'm not even kidding she's
actually doing that and this is a shot
of her live feed Oh what is that an iPad
case need pack a bed a centerfold oh you
go shoes too oh yeah there's actually
instructions in here and whatever we'll
figure it out let's play with the
sparklies there's a healthy assortment
of different types of Swarovski crystals
in here we have butterflies and some
diamonds ten minutes later I sorted out
all the crystals for you so you could
actually see what's in it you're welcome
I'm not even sure what you would call
this color of stone kind of looks like
multi Chrome to me you know what I'm
saying nail polish freaks changes colors
in the light then we got some classic
crystal diamonds some pretty pink stones
and some opal stones those blue ones are
shaped like nipples from 3d looking
diamonds all right I'm eager let's test
this tool am i picked you up girl BAM I
picked you up too no effort
oh yeah did it again she won't even come
off even when you try and shake her like
a stage five clinger dear crystal katana
I would never want to date you but I
will use you in
nail-art I'm going to show you how much
better the katana picks up crystals than
some other random products I found in my
stash that I haven't touched in months
this is a so-called white wax pencil
that I got from a store that starts with
Warren and ends with pretty either that
or Amazon or Ebay or somewhere cheap
from China like that so it picks it up
relatively well every other time but if
you press too hard it leaves a white
waxy residue on your crystal because the
pencil actually comes off on the sparkly
this is not cool the only place white
eyeliner ever belonged was on my inner
eyelid back in 1999
here's another cheap-ass cool I got for
a couple bucks only from the same place
I got the white pencil it was called a
gel pen because it's supposed to have
like a gel pit for something sticking
out of it but I never saw any gel tip do
you see one nope it's not even hollow in
the back so I don't know what happened
there clearly this ain't gonna pick up
anything call it manufacturers defect if
you want either way it doesn't work back
to the crystal katana that actually
works because it's a waxed tip that
means it will wear down eventually but I
asked the owner how long that actually
means and she said a tip lasts a hundred
thousand crystal placements so basically
it'll last you until you're done with
nail art as a hobby and decide to pick
up knitting cuz you're 80 boo sparkly
and blurry
stop getting distracted Christine so the
other side of the crystal katana has a
metal tool that you would use to secure
the crystals in place firmly into the
nail so a store that calls itself pretty
once told you that these were rhinestone
and you bought them and you were like
what those aren't even shiny can we just
compare this plastic crap to real
Swarovski crystals for a second doesn't
take a glitter expert to know the
difference here now does it
look at the olden days where I told
myself that these are actually pretty
the Kattan is gonna get rid of you she's
gonna take you all the way you gone
goodbye y'all have a little visit with
the garbage now how do we apply the
genuine sparklies to the nail you could
use nail glue that would let it stick on
your nail for a really long time
but because I change my nails so often I
really don't want to spend the time
picking off that glue so I'm just gonna
use a regular old clear polish and let
the crystal Kattan and do its work and
stick it right on there I use the other
end of the tool to secure the crystal
down further
keep moving quickly you don't want your
clear polish or nail glue to dry you can
also use the metal end to gently push
the crystal around if you kind of put it
in the wrong place go Catana go Catana
she's so easy to work with I love her
oh I think that I found myself a
cheerleader the cotton is my number one
crystallizer that did not sound one bit
like how the song rhyme part goes did it
check this out
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam I work really fast
when I'm under the influence of sparkle
we got room for more on the sides right
and why not let's go all up poke
someone's eye out next time I'll use
spiky studs and actually do that oh yeah
that's one badass sparkly turtle shell
if you ask me take that Rihanna bitch
better have my bling okay let's not do
something as ridiculous on our other
nails so we're just going to accent them
with crystals but first we got to start
by outlining a nice little black section
I'm gonna make it a chevron and we're
going to end up putting the crystals
over the black Chevron so I got a space
out the nut vinyls just enough so that
the crystal fits perfectly in the middle
size looks good to me oh wow it's the
first time in history then my
fingernails actually match on both hands
take a screenshot cuz you'll never see
it again I paint some black polish in
between the vinyls and peel them off now
in this case instead of adding a clear
polish just on the black Chevron which
would make it look messy I added a quick
dry top coat over the entire nail to
give it a nice full seal work quickly
with your crystal katana and stick on
those crystals I use the metal end to
help space them out properly a little
bit because obviously I don't know how
to pre calculate that in my head when I
put them on in the first place
alright we're looking good ladies so if
your school is one of those schools that
bans the wearing of nail polish I
recommend you revolt by wearing these
nails to overthrow the school's
administration you'll be talked about in
history forever
it's simply history class that is
