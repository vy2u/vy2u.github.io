everyday well well hallo everyone it's
me christine again oh my god
I am hair who know it's like that time
you guys send out a head legs simply tow
logical now you learn I have hair very
very long hair so long I could like put
it under my eyes when do you guys sent
me this hallo hairbrush to my P o box
and I'm so happy because I finally get
to use it on camera and this simply hair
loss of course tutorial I showered and
blow dried and then straightened my hair
last night because I knew it would take
way too long to do today and let's be
honest straightening this hair take
about as long as a trip to polish
Mountain there have been so many
requests from you guys for me to do a
simply hair illogical video and let me
get this because you know I have such
great hair talent with the way that I
wear my hair on a day-to-day basis and
it will kind of no surprise to you that
I would like holographic hair please
there we're done okay now I'm going to
put effort into this don't worry all I
want is a head full of real hollow and I
don't mean that fake must be
trying to pretend that pastel metallic
hair in different colors everywhere is
hollow it's not holographic
there that's obviously what stage does
not watch my video the only way to have
true holographic hair since I don't
think real hollow hair dye exists is to
amputate tiny pieces of holographic
tinsel and somehow get it into my scalp
which Paulo spaghetti
welcomed in them exactly like a hair
extension man you go like this cut cut
how do you put hair extensions but first
I think we need a haircut
well I draw did YouTube
hey is your hair long enough to do this
why are we lo mo surely la la la so what
I do to cut my hair every few years and
brush it to one side and pull straight
to the bottom now we have these little
slit ends suckers to cut off really
quite simple from there you just pretend
like you're cutting someone else's here
I tend to cut my hair like this like
using a tapering or feathering as you
can call a feather onion hair tutorial
win it makes it look more professional
fun fact when I was in grade school I
used to do this and cut the dead ends
off my hair in class it gets really
addicting just finding the dude and then
coding it all yeah bitch you going to
die I mean I know you already did but
you gonna die again isn't it weird how I
have pieces done at the bottom that are
so much later than like the rest of my
head it's because the very ends of my
hair still have memories of being died
back in high school I bleached my hair
myself but no one told me that that
required so much maintenance so when I
got old I just decided I have I had no
more time to that he'll never be a
real youtuber Chris yes would you like a
haircut solitary no you would be so
proud and it's a DIY I wonder if they
spelled it right nope
snapchat fan knows the struggles and
then we're going to take the bang that
aren't really bangs we all just want a
nice fresh shrimp got to look fresh when
you ask the hairdresser to take off just
a little bit and they actually listen
first we're going to divide our hair
into smaller sections how about we bring
you in a little closer so you can learn
better so basically just take a little
section of hair you split it into three
and then you braid bars are so few hair
tutorials on YouTube there's way more
makeup videos and way more nail videos
also but those aren't mine but where are
the hair videos okay people want to know
how to get cool hair too so
that's my contribution well all right
one eternity later now I just realized
that these pieces of hollow tinsel are
actually quite a bit shorter than the
length of my hair so we're gonna have to
get creative I remember what I learned
at camp correctly you're supposed to tie
them in a knot at the top of the braid
oh no I'm at the end of my hollow rope
okay well this looks like now I
remember why I never do my hair you know
I don't understand I used to be so good
at this hair wrap was back in the
day I can I was the girl that people
asked to wrap their hair with string I'm
great at those friendship bracelets too
let's try one more thing this
holographic thread weave it through the
bridge I'm trying it out this way so
that I don't have to tie it into my hair
since it looks like tying holographic
 into your hair is too slippery you
don't want to spit when you want to add
some more you just kind of poke a hole
in the braid all that through and
then keep on breathin okay I think I
kind of figured it out it's cute it kind
of curls at the bottom so let's do some
more braids because this is fun way to
spending my Sunday night how about some
pink colo hair trust me if this wasn't
killing my goddamn back I would put way
more strands of hallow in and do a full
head of hollow maybe next time I'll have
to hire a hollow helper see instead of
split ends I have hollow ones okay I did
as many as I could what do you think
what do you think what do you think
even though it's not really a full head
of hollow I think this actually looks
pretty cool and maybe a little trashy
but that's what kids say in school these
days right I'm so hollow trash today I
whip my hair back and forth I whip my
heart on the back and soft so tomorrow's
Monday and I feel like my boss is
getting now I had a lot of fun this
weekend oh my god I have to go to work
tomorrow because I am adult it's fine
you know like I'll just put on a hat and
no one will notice feel like after all
these years I have finally reached cool
kid status you know I may be 28 but I'm
making up for lost time
oh wait wait seemed Hollow when the
Hondo gang at everyday bro follow every
day bro all oh I'm so cool
what's our gang name what's up puddle
crawlin I mean I guess hollow sexual but
trying to be a bit more creative so
let's just put er s at the end of hollow

Hollow Earth but if you a hater don't
mess with me and my crew I'll digit you
