follow can you go hello everyone it's me
Christine with no H again yes I'm still
going to wear this blue shirt despite
the eyeliner stains thanks to my
boyfriend I don't need to remind you all
of my struggle my search for real
holographic makeup we have seen many
examples of makeup company using the
hollow name in vain they think they can
cook Veda into purchasing their
holographic highlighters holographic
highlighter trend I love it holographic
highlighter trend I just want a goddamn
actually holographic highlighter why is
this so hard
I'm tired of fake news so I'm going to
DIY it myself
kill me now so I've showed you guys in
other videos how in bonel world there's
this magical drug called linear
holographic powder and you can snort it
no you rubber buff it straight onto the
nail and it creates this mesmerizing
shifting rainbow I would like exactly
that as my highlight please and that
suggested by many of you in recent
comments why don't I just use this nail
powder on my face wow that's so smart
let me preface this with a disclaimer
this is not meant for your face for
your skin just for your nail so don't
put it on your face I mean it or else
people die horrible death in cream
polish hell are you scared yeah good now
don't be stupid like me okay I'm going
to try this because someone needs to do
this for science it's very important
I've accepted my role of hollow martyr
please remember me now since these are
all powders I could just take a little
fan brush and then dust it on but it is
my understanding that even when you're
using this stuff for nails it is not
good to inhale the powder okay put it on
oops but just for science even when I
try to dust it on my hand it's not
really sticking to my hand kind of just
flies everywhere
doesn't even really look hollow anymore
look filter it also comes off like super
easily but yeah this is count so I'm
going to make our I'm going to try a
liquid hollow highlighter partly because
I think that will help contain the
hollow powder so they won't just slide
everywhere into my Airways and also
because I kind of have the feeling that
it will make the hollow more
concentrated because it'll be wet goal
is to make something like these cover
effects enhancer drops in the color fake
hollow so I bought all sorts of
different oil because science bitch also
got a glass dropper bottle thing first
let's try jojoba oil or yo-ho-ho ba yo
mama I don't know how to pronounce this
 got to be a hundred percent jojoba
oil which is also good for your now so
mine is oh speaking of my nails we
haven't talked about what's on my hands
believe it or not it's a multi chrome
glitter that shifts all the way from
green to pink and purple it may not be
hollow but it's fabulous I'm just taking
a little scoop EULA and we're gonna mix
some of your mama oil
to see what happens I don't know what
the hell the right ratios or guess we'll
find out soon this is just a product
development stage ok don't yell a new
it's a magical hollow pool this might be
a little bit too oily I'm fully aware
that the macro view of this doesn't
really make it look hollow and that's in
part because I have a ring light right
here so duty purposes ring lights guys
up for living Apollo because there's a
diffuser around it and the light itself
is not good it's just not good for how I
don't ask questions let's see if I can
take this problem oh yeah there we go
now you see yeah let's try it on our
hand first it looks kind of grey safe Oh
oh my god I look so pretty with the
right lighting I think I got to work on
the formula a little but we're getting
somewhere next step I found this oil at
the drugstore
L'Oreal facial oil conveniently named
never open boxes with your nail it's not
worth the risk
take a little scoop eula uncut patter
for you do a little less oil this time
see how that works
oh my god I just want to bathe in this
 oh baby I'd go skinny-dipping a
mess let's just paint them on right
beside our last test swatch I don't know
what do we think do we see a difference
it might be because we used less oil but
the one with the L'Oreal face oil does
seem more pigmented more hollow it and
the last type of what we're going to try
it is body oil
let's mix that together hmm
yeah soup's on kids follow highlight
number three huh I think that one is
actually more pigmented but I think
that's just because I added more holo to
that sample oops now I wonder if the
other two have dried I see nope does oil
ever dry like I don't even know what the
 is in here that makes a draft
probably one of the ingredients I can't
pronounce let's analyze the test
subjects shall we interestingly when I
go back to the first oil that's the
Dodoma or whatever it's kind of gone a
little yellow who peed in my hollow if
we take a look at the face oil it
actually appears to have dried up a
little and now that the body oil has had
a little chance to sit it's drying up a
bit but definitely not as much as the
facial oh so what are we going to do
class we're going to use this rigorous
scientific evidence to inform the next
steps in this research project and make
the ultimate liquid holo highlighter so
we're going to put a bunch of this in
bits you want to watch cool because I'm
going to show you
in the science queen now let's tap in a
little bit of hollow powder at a time
happening captain Eddie
chicka chicka hi baby
I'm a hollow and a bottle baby you gotta
rub me the right way huh let's just dump
the whole thing in here cuz I'll go why
didn't you record the measurements
Christine you are terrible scientist oh
my God look at it
yeah the beautiful waterfall of hollow
and now you drink oh yeah yeah I think
we have done it's my friends we have
found a hollow cure behold a true
holographic I like some may call it a
hollow later and now time to duck update
on my hand though I don't have any
visible reaction to the hollow powder
just to be sure let's wipe it off and
see if I have a ration pan looks all
good and fine actually it's just quite
soft and moisturized soft like a baby's
bottom away since we haven't talked
about what's on my other hand it's a
beautiful turquoise aqua crown and yes
there is Halloween it's quite faint it's
like it's lost in the ocean I'll write a
business tag it's time for business this
Beauty Blender is dirty so we're going
to cut the sponge perfect looks like a
carrot drop the hollow directly on the
sponge and now pray for me
ho-ho-hold oh my god oh my gosh hold on
let me turn down the nice one yeah oh
here we go I'm trying to blend this in
with my existing makeup but a skin tone
isn't really silver so it's not really
the left for Lance if I die at least I
look fabulous
alright iPhone show us the rainbow isn't
working is it working come on now
rainbow yes no I just want to go to the
hollow god I think your makeup company's
made this for real they might use
ingredients
helps them blend into your skin better I
don't know what those are I'm not going
to put any on my lips or anywhere closer
to my eyes because death not that I'm
feeling any reaction or anything on my
skin that really just feels like oil but
science doesn't know yet what is in
hollow that makes it so dangerous come
on in baby get close to my
all right everybody back up you're
freaking me out cheese beauty she's
great she has cool so it kind of worked
like also not really what I was really
picturing was not glitter it was fine
linear holographic pigment like we use
in the nail powders to buff on the nail
on my face it is hollow in some lighting
but not mostly it looks a bit more
hollow in the bottle the other thing is
that it settles quite quickly but I
still believe that one day a makeup
company can make this work come on
science we've come so far but yet not
far at all I will continue my search my
quest for real how will makeup and don't
forget to comment down below and let me
know how went when you try it out this
DIY hollow highlight that was a test
you're not supposed to do it don't be a
dummy youtuber use only cosmetics that
are safe for your face on your face and
it's not even worth doing it in my
opinion because it didn't really turn
out that great but that's what simply
face logic goal is here for bringing you
mediocre beauty tutorials make sure you
subscribe for more all right I'm gonna
wash these potentially harmful chemicals
off my face now even though Hollow
shouldn't be harmful thanks so much for
watching and I'll see ya
