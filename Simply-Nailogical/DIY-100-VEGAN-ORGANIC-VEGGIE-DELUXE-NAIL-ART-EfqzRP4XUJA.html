servings of vegetables today hallo
everyone it's me Christine and I've been
thinking last week I did some chocolate
nails and those aren't very healthy you
know so I thought it's definitely time
to detox my nails by having my nails
drink tea
just kidding that's stupid we've got to
feed them vegetables I want to be a good
role model and promote healthy eating
your mom always says you need to eat
your vegetables and you should always
listen to your mother so we've seen lots
of different nail trends like bubble
nails furry nails men she is the pioneer
of that one and scorpion nails but why
not vegetable nails am i right it's
totes on trend with the vegan movement
I'm so vegan you already know in the
veggie lane from lettuce to potato
why am i singing I should be posting
pictures of these vegetables to my
Instagram and telling everyone what a
healthy lifestyle I have to make them
feel bad about themselves look at my
vegetables feel bad about yourself look
at my vegetables feel bad about yourself
at first I thought of doing these
raspberry nails but I think it's been
done before and I really wanted to be
original and unique and authentic and
just live life in the moment you know
now let us begin with this 100% organic
responsible ethical local organic
homegrown organic nail art tutorial
first we're gonna start off with some
vegan cuticle oil i said vegan not
virgin and you're just gonna pour a
generous helping of that vegan oil all
over your nails it's really good for you
you are instantly so much healthier
rabbit around don't be afraid to get
messy but also remember you have to be
pure and innocent I'm just using a meat
basting brush to spread the oil around
did I just say meat aha sometimes I get
so angry I feel like I could kill people
oh man she my furry friend oh hello
there you're wondering what the hell
mommy's doing aren't you oh look an
onion weird okay bye
so next we're just gonna start slicing
up some of these veggies
wait should we be cutting up these
vegetables that's vegan cruelty no no I
cut the sticker I'm so sorry
this
red pepper looks spicy cuz it's red yo
these celery stalks have a natural
gradient white and then it's green and
then it's white and then it's green you
could cut them up this way and get these
little cyclone thingies or you could
dissect them this way and kind of curve
it around your nail hey its curved just
like my nails I am so offended by this
eggplant because it has the word egg in
it and eggs are from animals also why is
this not purple on the inside I bought
this literally because I thought it
would be purple yes that pointing ah but
if we peel the skin we can't harvest the
purple I'm not gonna cut this onion
because I don't want to cry again oh
look at all the pretty colors of lettuce
what did the vegan say to the meat eater
let us be friends just kidding the vegan
didn't want to be their friend guys
mushrooms are so weird I don't think I
have mushroom for these on my nails
and besides mushrooms are drugs trucks
are bad ooh
so this is kale that's a really nice
purple in it is this what kale chips are
are these kale chips someone please tell
me carrots
those are good for your eyes it's
keratin that's in carrots right that's
good for you right I'm just using an
evil slicer tool to peel the carrot like
no big deal oh hey I have an honest
question if you're a vegan and you don't
tell anyone that you're a vegan are you
really a vegan that's enough vegetable
murder we're gonna move on and start
painting our nails
I mean wait no no we're not painting our
nails from putting vegetables on our
nails God Christine ooh what's that
hollow green polish on my other hand
it's a beautiful deep holographic
emerald green hollow and it must be
vegan because it's green so next I'm
going to take my cute little pieces of
tail and I'm gonna wrap them around my
finger because we're gonna make a cute
little kale skirt I'm using some
double-sided tape because I don't know
how else to stick vegetables together
there we go just adjust the skirt a
little bit you don't want to show your
private parts now now we're gonna shove
some carrot down the kale skirt get in
there don't make me force these
vegetables down your skirt next we're
gonna apply some glossy taco down the
center I mean no tacos are evil and
we're gonna use our crystal katana to
pick up some pepper seeds and you
thought the crystal katana was just for
picking up rhinestones don't forget you
can get 10% off the crystal katana with
my code simply 10 for all your pepper
seed placing needs if you flip the
katana around there's a handy little
metal tool that you can use to perfect
the placement of the seeds be careful
don't hurt them though and you're done
that's it it was so easy I freaking love
these vegetable nails this tutorial was
not meant to offend vegans okay although
it still probably will I really just
wanted to put veggies on my nails and
make a social commentary about something
that is funny to me please don't protest
me and don't worry I didn't waste this
food right after this video I
immediately made a salad and ate all of
it y'all never know when I'm being
serious or when I'm being sarcastic make
sure to stay tuned for my next nail art
tutorial I think I'm gonna do fruit
nails please don't leave me alone don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
want to join the vegan nail art
vegetables on your nails move
thanks so much for watching all of you
all very much see y'all next time bah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
