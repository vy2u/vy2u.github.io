to make your own black sheer polish only
a million other nail bloggers have done
this performing but what's another one
now before all the hungry haters out
there jump right down to the comment box
to tell me that my nails are yellow you
don't have to I already know to make
your own custom black sheer nail polish
all you need is a bottle of straight-up
clear polish I'm using Sally Hansen's
invisible you've also seen me use
Revlon's natural now clear nail polish
is not the same thing as clear topcoat
clear topcoat will be much thicker and
for this purpose you want your DIY shear
tint to be thin and easily buildable
like normal nail polish not like taco
the only other thing you need is your go
to black creme plain nail polish just
hold your black polish brush over the
clear polish bottle and drop a couple
drops in start with just a couple drops
of black polish at a time because that
this exercise control Z will not undo
the one too many polish drops you may
have put in when you were too excited
whoa look at it fall in this is science
kids but
how to explain it focus its business
time and now you've got to shake it up
just shake it up or shake it like a
Polaroid picture for those of you in my
generation test your laboratory results
on a white piece of paper you see just
how dark your black tint polishes keep
adding a couple drops at a time and
testing and then adding and the testing
and adding until you're happy in the end
I added somewhere between twenty and
thirty drops of black polish but I can't
remember exactly because I didn't count
now to put it on my nails wait a second
my nails are dirty look how yellow they
are that's disgusting no oh I don't know
where to begin you can just watch my new
video on why yellow nails don't matter
if you think people with yellow nails or
the some of the earth and you need to
watch my new video be careful though
you'll find out some educational
material on how yellow nails aren't
actually a bad thing which will then
prove you wrong
and we all know haters like being right
haters gonna hate yellow nails gonna be
yellow whatever moving on
apply your newly made DIY sheer black
polish on your yellow or not yellow
nails doesn't matter
that's one coat and I decided to add a
second to make it a little bit more of a
deep black
I'm bored let's add some holo
holographic pop codes and hit the link
down below for y'all and although it's
hollow effect is so strong that she can
barely see the sheer black anymore still
think it looks pretty cool it's kind of
got a sneaky and lack sheer
hollow attitude to it speaking of
you can check out my fishnet
flaky nails if you're feeling a little
naughty
alright y'all see y'all next time y'all
sexy little kittens I don't know why I'm
sayin y'all all of a sudden it's kind of
fun word to say oh that's American
Plus Canadian oops see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
