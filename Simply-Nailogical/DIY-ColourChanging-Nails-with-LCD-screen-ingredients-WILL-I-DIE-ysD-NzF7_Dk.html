where I experiment with some crazy
fucked up shit on my nails so you don't
have to is it a distant cousin of the
unicorn a rabid insect a majestic beetle
or maybe just what's in your TV screen
and your cell phone and whatever else
other LCD screens you have that you
press that make really cool colors and
that you shouldn't be pressing because
that's bad for it don't do that but yes
what's on my nails right now is the same
shit that's inside your TV screen and
your computer monitor it's called liquid
crystal and that's where LCD comes from
liquid crystal displays Wow what do you
know that makes too much sense of course
your TVs and other screens are made up
of a whole bunch of different layers of
shit but liquid crystal is somewhere in
the middle now because I am NOT a
scientist and I actually don't know
anything about this I'm just gonna
quickly show you this Wikipedia page
about liquid crystal displays did you
get it to get it good now if this weird
ivory paste I'm showing you in a bottle
right now is liquid crystal how the fuck
does it do all those magical
color-changing things the most concise
definition for why it does that that I
could find is this one and yet that's
still not English to me but basically
from what I understand it means when you
press down on the liquid crystal it
pushes the shit around and makes it
reflect light at different angles
causing it to change into cool colors
and shit subscribe to my channel if you
want me to be your science teacher now
because you're a smartass your next
question is probably is this shit safe
for your nails
let's look at the ingredients
I don't know what the fuck any of that
means there's also very little
information online as to whether or not
it's safe to put on your skin I'm also
pretty sure they're not FDA approved for
use in cosmetics so basically you should
not do what I'm doing right now but I'm
willing to take the risk for you to test
out this potentially deadly substance on
my nails if I don't upload a video next
week you'll know why but in case you
want to get some of this shit and you're
gonna put it on other things other than
your body parts and you won't sue me for
it I put the link down below where I got
it and I even got you a discount code
that's right use code simply to save
some money because I don't know how this
works first we got to do some
experiments that's right it's time to do
experiments apparently it works best
with the black base so first I'm just
putting some black polish on a nail art
mat then I'm applying the liquid crystal
with a random paintbrush it doesn't
apply that smoothly like nail polish we
have very high standards let it dry
probably took about 20 minutes and now
for the touch test ooh ooh did you see
that yeah wow that is freaking cool
according to the instructions you're
supposed to seal this stuff with a clear
protectant in nail language I think they
mean a glossy taco so we're just gonna
go with that
immediately after applying it a kind of
went black but then about 10 minutes
later it was all sorts of different
colors and when I press it it makes it
more blue
here's another test swatch without the
glossy taco and as I rub it it goes from
green to blue all right I think I'm
understanding this so let's level up
nail swatches still not my real nail
still testing just applying some black
nail polish and what I've done here is
tried out different thicknesses of the
liquid crystal because I wasn't sure if
I need more or less let's check in on
the ones on the right yep they're
definitely working I'm going to apply a
quick dry glossy taco on one half of the
test nails and clear nail polish on the
other half now if you've seen my videos
before you know that there is a big
difference between the two a quick dry
glossy taco is much thicker than a clear
polish and it has stuff in it that makes
it speed up the drying process
there's different chemical composition
or whatever can also see that they have
some kind of impact on the color of the
liquid crystal stuff weird the science
is real so for whatever reason all my
other tests kind of failed and they lost
the color changing effect mostly staying
black and blue so let's try something
new how about using black acrylic paint
instead of black nail polish the kerlick
paint might have less of a chemical
reaction with the liquid crystal because
nail polish has more chemicals in it and
my reactive really haha I don't know I'm
just making this shit up okay once the
acrylic paint was dry we'd paint on a
thick coat of liquid crystal for this
nail and a thinner coat on the next nail
let it dry it took about half an hour
for me now I'm going to apply a glossy
taco on one of them and clear nail
polish on the other about 20 minutes
later the kids must have done drugs or
something because the shit is wack let's
touch them oh so what I'm learning is
that the more you touch them the more
blue and black you make it how about
this thick one that I have yet to put a
taco on ah that's the most satisfying
thing I have ever seen I don't think I
can stop touching it now that we've
completed all those experiments I think
I'm ready to put it on my nails I got
the skills I have the knowledge
no I don't who gives a fuck let's
proceed I didn't film this part but I am
wearing a peel-off base coat under this
to help protect me and also for peel
porn stay tuned until the end now I'm
just applying some black acrylic paint
with the paint brush on my nails acrylic
paint dries super quickly so when that's
dry I started applying the liquid
crystal because I wasn't sure if this is
gonna burn my skin off I did take
precautions and scrape it off my finger
when it starts to dry it looks really
cool oh it's like a natural gradient and
about 15 to 20 minutes later my middle
finger looked like this I'm just gonna
add a second coat because I feel like it
needs to be thicker to have a super
multicolored effect and clean the skin
prevent the cancer yada-yada about 20
minutes later they looked more boring
and brown let's investigate so if I
touch down gently it starts to turn the
copper and brown parts more green and if
you push down even more it makes the
green blue
now let's seal everything with a quick
dry glossy taco so crazy how it changes
the color right in front of your eyes
Wow
science why didn't I pay more attention
to you in high school all that looks
like shit but don't worry 20 minutes
later my nails look like this
so obviously there's some kind of
temperature impact on the liquid crystal
because the tips of my nails are cooler
than the face of my nails and when you
rub it it does even crazier shit so some
of you might be asking well isn't this
the same thing as thermal nail polish
and scientifically speaking no it's
definitely not show me a thermal nail
polish that does this kind of shit from
what I understand the liquid crystals
can be affected both by temperature but
also by pushing them around and changing
the refraction angle of the light which
changes the colors at least that's what
I understood so in that sense it's sort
of similar to thermal nail polish but
it's kind of more of a scattered effect
once you start pressing on it and
playing around how about some blow-dryer
action this is going from room
temperature to hot air and stuck my hand
in the freezer for a few seconds and it
looks like this it kind of reminds me of
when copper oxidizes on
buildings now I'm just blowing some more
hot air on it and woohoo my nails are
literally an earth topography map please
do you remember those right those were
so colorful and pretty oh I know now
let's dip them in some cold water
experimenting is so fun whoa
see I don't just do stupid videos okay I
teach you things this is actual science
open your eyes look at the science it's
right in front of you let's put an ice
cube on it wow that's like pushing it
and making it cold those liquid crystals
must be freaking the fuck out but does
with every science experiment fair it
must come to an end and you probably
lost as you can see my experiment is
starting to rip up and looking back at
the footage I know I am directly
responsible for this I failed to
completely seal the nail with the glassy
taco leaving the liquid crystal
vulnerable and exposed to water which I
don't think it can mix with the water
kind of deteriorates it and yeah shit
falls apart from there all the other
edges of my nails are good so I'm
assuming it's just because I missed a
patch of glossy taco and this is the
part of the video where the new people
confirmed that I am crazy because it
sounds like I'm talking about putting
food on my nails what a good time for
peel porns and yeah let me see you peel
girl whoa that's a peel like I've never
seen before what's happening it's like
shedding it
in layers I guess this makes sense
actually because you don't just want to
take it all off at once you know you got
to be strategic about it firstly take
off the glossy taco layer tease you just
a little bit then we try and peel off
just the liquid crystal layer but it's
hard because our bras and panties are
sucked to it all right well let's just
take it all off we're here now and then
you go to struggle with them pasties tip
won't get unstuck
this nail on the other hand got naked
real quick it was not messing around
with that multiple layer bullshit not as
soon as I took it off my nail it changed
from blue to green almost immediately
Wow the science never ends oh hey there
other hand I almost forgot about you I
was so distracted by the science stay
tuned for one of my next videos which is
going to show you how I did these nails
and they are actually nail art not just
weird random bullshit videos hope you
enjoyed this simply science lesson 101
be sure to go tell your science teachers
all about liquid crystals I'm sure you
know everything you need to know now
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
