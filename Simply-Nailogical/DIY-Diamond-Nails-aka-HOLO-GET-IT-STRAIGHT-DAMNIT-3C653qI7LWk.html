pretty sure they mean shine bright like
a hollow well hallo everyone it's me
Christine again before we get into it
quick announcement the hollow certs are
back by population after months of you
guys asking to bring it back we asked
the hollow gosh and they were like yeah
we will bring them back for you so if
you've been wanting one now's your
chance to grab one epic whimper well and
now on to the video there's something
that's been in the mail news media
lately and I think we should investigate
diamonds nails so they call it they're
going to be your best friend Nicky what
do you mean they're not real diamonds
what you lied to us
news media shocking apparently the
diamond nail trend originated from
Korean male artists male underscore you
know Stella you can find her on
Instagram or in Korea excellent video
evidence apparently she is also the one
responsible for the shattered glass male
trend last year interesting very
interesting but the diamond nails mm-hmm
mm-hmm beautiful beautiful beautiful and
hollow I must have it but how does she
do it what I do know is my nails need
this 3d hollow me to Annette Gilbert 32
me too let's investigate the secret code
Google shall translate it for us die
Armin L that is of no help now what does
this mean the charm bursts okay then
what about this I do not need a diamond
ring I do not know same-same longer code
I posted how profile link what what
that's just a bullshit Mary Claire
article you lied to a Instagram now we
must do our own research this looks like
a blog why the mail not Eunice tell what
is this this is her website she looks so
hot
and I'm looking and I'm looking I don't
understand too much code okay
wear a diamond nail on finding his
models and runway bullshit after so much
research we have found literally nothing
by the way I didn't know I'm a
researcher in my day job I should be
fired in any case I love a good
challenge and you know what I think
diamond nails look like this exact
silver holographic nail file Wow
what a fucking mystery let's begin I'm
starting out by adding a peel-off base
coat because there will be people torn
at the end of this video I promise I
know this seems quite opposite but the
first thing we're doing is adding a
glossy gel taco
that's right gel topcoat because I don't
think this diamond look would work good
enough with regular polish because
regular polish ruins foil and it also
doesn't really build up in the same way
that gel polish does and you tear your
gel polish in the purple alien spaceship
lamp now I'm applying some foil glue
this is some kind of sticky glue that's
specifically designed for use of nail
foils you can get that shit on Amazon I
put some links below
not even that sticky of a glue it's just
sticky enough can lift up the foil takes
about a minute or so to dry and when it
dries it goes from a blueish tint to
completely clear gotta wait for the glue
to turn clear because that means it's no
longer wet but just tack and tacky is
what you want for the foil to stick to
now that we're in the clear cut up some
pretty easy to find basic silver
holographic nail art foil you can get
lots of places online I don't make the
same mistake I made a long time ago when
I first did this you got to place the
ugly side down on the nail and the
pretty side is facing up press down on
the foil with enough pressure that it
starts to stick to the nail but oh wait
a second what's on my other hand
it's a beautiful purple jelly hollow oh
yes I was before but I'm still wearing
it because it's beautiful keep pressing
down the hollow foil because the point
is to get it to stick to your hole now
you'll see that the foil may even start
to lift up that's a good thing because
it means that the pattern has
successfully transferred onto your nail
peel it up gently and
Tigers little because I am wearing a
peel-off face coat but BAM that's the
first step of diamond nail but why do
they call it diamond nail when they are
so obviously hollow nails so fill a
cutie-pie hate the media build-up the
effect to make it a bit more 3d and to
fill in the spaces where the foil didn't
transfer I'm now applying another glossy
gel taco we read back out of a kit ball
minute add another thin layer of the
foil glue wow look at how much that
looks like a unicorn skin pretty that's
actually a nice effect end of the self
Wow glue please don't dry you look cool
like about one minute later it's the
acceptable amount of dry and khaki and
so we're going to add another layer of
the hollow foil it has to be a new layer
it can't be the same one you used last
time because once you use it it lifts up
the hollow don't worry about it most of
these foils are cheap as shit make sure
the second time around you're focusing
more on the sides of your nails and the
tips because that's probably where the
foil is least likely to stick especially
if your nails are really curved like
mine so I struggled a lot with that we
all know this too pretty
oh of course I fucked up the tip you can
try and save it by putting some extra
foil on your blank spot but doesn't
always work in any case when you are
happy you complete the look by adding a
glossy gel taco again fake fake fake
like a cake cake did you guys see my
cake video I'm good I need dinner and
I've decided to add a second final gel
glassy taco to really bring out the 3d
effect you own I mean it gives it like a
more solid bubble effect on the foil
projecting it and yeah science it or
something look at all of my holographic
foil scraps you are not scratched to me
I will keep you forever and cherish you
and well would you look at that King
Diamond nails on my now
I honestly don't think it's any more
complicated than just slapping on some
holographic foil on your nail I
anticipate that a lot of you are going
to ask you to do this with regular
polish and I always say that yes you
could do it with regular polish but
you're probably not going to get the
same building up kind of 3d effect of
adding multiple layers of glossy gel
Paco
and the other challenge is that regular
quick dry top coat tend to crackle these
kinds of foil to kind of dull them and
makes them less shiny and less Hollow
and the hollow deserves to be treated
with the utmost respect I agree with
most of you though that gel nails is
kind of complicating you're like what's
the clamps no but I found that it's
actually not that bad to just use gel
topcoat you can get at home UV gel limp
pretty cheap now on Amazon and if all
you're using it for is the taco like I
do sometimes and it's not so bad I
assure you it's not so bad but I would
like to know that I'm not the only one
who takes I cracked the code on how to
do diamond nail
let me know down below in the comment if
you think I am or if you think I'm just
wrong and there's a whole other way to
do that let me know in the comments you
know what I realize though about
quote-unquote of diamonds and nails not
only is there this kind of shattered cut
up diamond pattern there's dozens of all
sorts of kinds of patterns of hollow
foil and you could have a whole lot of
how little fun with those possibilities
oh shit and guess what you could also do
colored diamond nails with different
colors of the very same hollow foil I
have just uncovered the secrets of life
you are welcome and now it wouldn't be a
true simply illogical video conclusion
without some peel porn oh and you guys
know how satisfying it is to peel off
something that has gel on it ah yeah boy
the way the gel solidifies into a turtle
shell and then pops right off Oh get me
every time
beautiful beautiful new collection to
add to my peewee bag what do you know
the underside looks like antiques
alright guys I hope you enjoyed this
video and don't forget if you wanted a
hollow its new your hollow sexual real
hollow foiled
you can grab the mouth or a limited
times down below it's a link in the
video's description box thank you guys
so much for showing so much love and
support to t-shirts like you guys are
wild Hollow sexual savages alright
