swear this is not cocaine hallo everyone
welcome back it's me Christine again and
today we're gonna do some dip powder
nails because bloat of you keep asking
me to do them first because I don't
trust any of this shit I'm gonna put on
my favorite peel-off base coat so I can
peel this shit up
hopefully afterwards normally I would
use the hand I don't give a shit about I
call her Cindy but she's wearing
something so pretty and I didn't want to
take it off so I'm sorry tutorial star
hand you're gonna have to be the guinea
pig today so I found this dip powder on
Amazon I put the link below but it's
expensive as fuck so I don't recommend
getting two came with a lot of
instructions that's good because I have
no idea what I'm doing
step 1 sanitize hands my nails are clean
okay
you very much use a fine drill bit or
buffer - what no you know apply liquid
number 1 oh that's not mysterious at all
they call it the pro base ok as soon as
I open this bottle my eyes started
burning this shit not only smells it
actually burned my eyeballs so don't
look directly at it and odor-free my ass
after applying the pro base dip the
finger in the powder yeah we gonna do
the dip this parts fun this is really
the reason why I wanted to do this I
just wanted to dip my nail in powder I
don't do that normally so so it's like a
true first-time experience you know when
I ordered this particular shade I
thought it was way more purple than it
is appearing to be maybe they put too
much flour in the mix and the powder
factory I'm not sure anyways I just fan
dust the excess powder often I have a
vampire bite apparently now it doesn't
even say this in the instructions but
according to all the YouTube videos I
watched about this you're supposed to
repeat these steps with the pro base and
then the powder until it's opaque enough
you know what this purple is boring me
so I'm going to create a gradient with
the purple and some hollow powder we
just gonna do
the tip just the chat ladies and
gentlemen just the tip get it in there
yeah get it nice and covered yeah dig
that sand honestly the powder isn't even
completely Hollow I think there's hollow
with a bunch of other white shit that's
not hollow disappointed again the
picture made me buy it as I dust it off
it's getting a pig but it's not 100%
opaque so we gonna dip one my time take
your pro base apply your pro base dust
your purple powder dip into the hollow
powder
I love dipping see how it's mostly not
hollow in this powder pool dust it off
and do a little blendy blendy Wendy when
the base is dry that's when you can go
to town with the dusting and get all the
excess powder off now I think we're done
what do I do next apply a generous
amount of number two activator on all
five fingers just five why not ten and
here we have bottle number two kind of
looks like a matte top coat so I noticed
that it feels really bumpy literally
feels like sand but oh what's that on my
other hand oh my god it's King rose-gold
bitch that's what it is
this was limited edition last year but
people loved it so much that they
brought it back it's jam-packed with
tiny copper or rose gold whatever you
want to call it I was trending little
flakies it's not hollow but it's awesome
and shiny is fuck stop getting
distracted
step eight once dry shape the nails with
a file a drill can be gently used to
remove a halt our drills ever gently
used I don't have a drill and I would
never use a drill on my nail so that
step use a buffer to smooth out nails
have cus customer the fuck so I think
the idea is you're supposed to file or
buff the nail down so it doesn't feel
like sandpaper so I have this buffer
thing and I really don't want to use it
it's giving me serious anxiety it I
never buffed my natural nails because
that will literally take off layers of
your nail that's why my nails are yellow
because I don't buff it away
anyways I suppose what I'm doing here is
okay and not a risk to my nails because
it feels like I'm buffing off mountains
of rock hard wet sand ah hahaha the
buffing sand cringe
my nails look like how people's nails
look when they go to nail salons so I
rinse them and I think the nails are
pretty smooth anyways I don't really
care for not gluey smooth let's move on
to the next step apply another coat of
number two alright number two it's your
lucky day again looks like a matte
topcoat not really sure of its purpose
it also made my eyes burn just just a
note step number 11 apply number three
finish gel the bottle doesn't even have
the number three on it I was expecting
the number three to be on it so this is
like a glossy taco yes it is finally now
shit's looking a little smoothing off
there's a lot of steps number twelve
wait 15 seconds then continue on the
same hand and apply a slower more
detailed coat of number three okay so
basically add a second glossy taco
that's topcoat two new people here you
should subscribe for more really helpful
nail tutorials that you're definitely
going to do at home then you got to
repeat the steps and oil and scan a
barcode and there you have it dip powder
nails done at home by yours truly
someone who isn't actually a nail
technician and has no idea about any of
this shit I just put on my nails if that
wasn't clear already the pinky is kind
of DUP gotta admit I did that one first
and it turned out a little thick a
little lumpy but I got the hang of it by
the time I did the second nail for never
having used this ship before I think I
did pretty good at fade from the non
hollow purple to the sort of hollow
silver you'd think I was a professional
haha one thing I noticed is that this
shit is thick as like this bitch she's
real thick you know what I'm saying the
natural see curve on my nail has been
made into a tighter see because this
stuff is so heavy here you can see the
difference in my C curves from one hand
to the other I know right the powder dip
one is tight it really feels like I have
cement on my fingers or maybe just
acrylic nails I don't know is that what
acrylic nails feel like actually what
the hell is in this anyways is this
acrylic did I just put acrylic on my
natural nails oh me if I can't peel
these off without any
image I'm gonna be real pissed all right
now let's try and take them off
everybody say a prayer for me so I just
hopped in the shower because all the
water will make it easier to lift off
the nail Paley's that's the hope anyway
now I'm just gonna lube up my nails
I mean apply a lot of nail oil it helps
soften the skin and loosen the pili up
and I can already feel was really really
stuck to my nail around the edges it was
like been cemented but thanks to the
water and all the Lube and a lot of
patience I was able to carefully pry
them up and finally get them to pop off
whoo thank God I don't gotta soon nobody
today it looks like a turtle shell like
a really hard purple sparkly turtle
shell let's do it again because you're
really enjoying the peel porn if you
like to watch me appeal for you you
should watch my peel porn videos I've
made too so far this one was stubborn as
fun we got a man she hair men she's my
cat oh all it hurts pulling on my nails
oh okay
we did it cool five dip powder peeling
nails to add to my collection let's
touch them Oh oops
these are the hardest P leaves I have
ever peeled off my nails usually they're
really soft and you can kind of bend
them a bit nope these ones are rock-hard
and now for my overall review I don't
like this and I'm not gonna use it again
there were so many pink steps when you
could just paint your nails with nail
polish that would be a lot easier and I
don't understand what's in it even the
Internet let me down and I couldn't find
a clear answer based on how it feels and
smells I think this is some salon level
shit which I don't really like to touch
on my natural nails because I'm afraid
of it eating them would you consider
getting dip powder nails I mean the
dipping part is fun but the rest of it
not a fan
let me know below in the comments tell
me I'm not crazy and that you probably
don't want to do this either alright
guys so I got a dip so uh thanks so much
for watching it I'll see y'all at
