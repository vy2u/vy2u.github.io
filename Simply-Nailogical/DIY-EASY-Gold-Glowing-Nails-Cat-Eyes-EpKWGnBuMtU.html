ain't messing with no broke holo graphic
foil on your nails
hey hey hallo everyone it's me christine
again and today I've got some bomb-ass
gold hollow nails yes hallo yes glowing
yes I also have some very important news
I'm on Twitter I'm a bird you should
follow me there I know I'm really late
to the Twitter party but you should
tweet me and I'll tweet Twitter you back
I'm also on snapchat have been for a few
months I'm pretty much an expert at
using all the filters there so you
should also follow me there yes join the
snap BAM first off its base coat time
other nail artists feel like add a
regular base coat to make your nail
polish last simply analogical be like
how to peel off face because we're going
to peel that off your hand
next up make your nails black I'm still
using my favorite black from what's the
best black polish drugstore edition but
I am running out the bottle is like half
empty we're half full depends on how you
look at it either way I may just
continue my search for the best black
again so let me know down in the
comments if you have a suggestion for
one I haven't tried yet green multi
Chrome oh I think got multi Chrome
sexual right now so you can stare at
this multi chrome porn that I ended up
putting on my nail but in the end I
didn't really knew that also this stuff
is completely unnecessary but I wanted
to show you the porn anyways so pretty
though for our I'm a reptile next up is
the gold haul of foil yes I got this
super hollow gold foil along with a foil
glue from bundle monster I've put a link
down below it's in a kit of different
foils
and don't forget you can use my codes
simply for 10% off get some holo and
save some money then buy some more holo
with that money you just saved
lifecycles of a holo sexual so after
applying one thin coat of foil glue you
just gotta let it dry until it's a
little tacky you'll know it's completely
dry when it doesn't look
and it just looks clear then you just
cut up a little piece of foil and press
the foil down on the nail with the
pattern colored side up if you do it the
other way it's not gonna work I fully
admit I did that my first time and I was
like what the am I doing wrong
see I teach you life skills on this
channel you're welcome when it's all
pressed firmly on the nail you're gonna
rip it off like a band-aid
if only band-aids were Hollow now
originally I thought that there was no
way this gold foil was going to
completely cover my nail and that's why
I painted the green multi chrome
underneath because I thought you'd seen
like lines of it yeah everything
underneath this was pretty much
unnecessary who cares
look at the hollow honestly if you're
feeling lazy just slapping on some
hollow foil like this is super easy to
do and everyone will be amazed at your
nails and ask where you got them done
and then you'll be like bitch I do my
own nails but wait if I put a topcoat on
this will it kill my hollow vibe because
I ain't gon let that happen and now it's
time to do some tests and simply Mia
logicals nail experimentation lab first
I'm applying foil glue on a white piece
of paper very pristine environment we
require in this laboratory transfer the
foil onto the paper peel off the foil
now add more cuz that doesn't really
work ooh pretty shiny rainbow colors yes
last time around some of you guys
suggested that I try out picture
polishes foil topcoat why didn't I think
about earlier I don't know and you can
sort of see a tiny bit of clouding but
I'm not really sure let's let it dry and
try another experiment
peel off base coat yes sounds weird I
know again maybe a tiny bit of clouding
but it's really hard to tell so I let
them dry a little bit and I think it's
pretty clear that both of them did cloud
the foil just a little bit maybe the
picture polish one clouds the foil a
little bit less so let's add a regular
quick dry top coat because you know how
shitty that is and then we can compare
yes so the regular quick dry taco ate my
Hollow I still think having no topcoat
on the foil is best and leaves it the
most Hollow but you got to put some kind
of topcoat on it or also all the foil is
going to flake off I'll just go with the
picture polish one because it's called a
foil topcoat and the peel off base coat
one I'm not really sure how that's gonna
work as a topcoat maybe it will just
peel off the top of my nail does that
make any sense
before I did the tests I was an idiot
and put a regular Kris dry top coat on
one side of my pinky and the animal
agency is garbage and ooh we haven't
discussed quite yet what's on my other
hand it's a pretty non-traditional
simply analogical color I admit it I was
kind of feeling some happy springtime
colors okay this is also a picture
polished polish a picture polished
polish oh my god it was designed in
collaboration with Kelly Marissa you
guys should go check her out on you
to some pretty awesome nail art
tutorials and I'm just gonna go ahead
and finish top coat in my nails with the
foil topcoat I also just wanted to talk
for a minute about how I've been doing
some kind of stupid videos lately yeah
yes I have some of you guys are actually
scared that I was turning into a makeup
channel have you never heard the sarcasm
in my voice
but no silly I'm not turning into an
actual makeup channel and even though I
like to throw in some punny videos
sometimes I'm not deviating too far from
nails so don't worry I'm just having a
little fun okay and it looks like
there's a lot of you who actually enjoy
this random fun that I have on this
channel find that I get quite a lot of
comments from you guys saying that you
don't even do your nails or you don't
like nails and you still watch my weird
 this is all anecdotal of course so
how about we gather some empirical
evidence and see if that statement is
still supported if you didn't know I'm a
data nerd that's what I do in my regular
full-time conventional office job so
let's do a quick survey it should have
popped up on YouTube right about now so
you can click that little info card
thing and answer the question I will
share the results on Twitter because now
I have it and I will use it I will so
make sure you vote make your voice heard
now let's make my nails into cats next
I'm going to freehand paint weird I know
right some cat eye shapes onto my nails
I got this idea from nailed by Cambria
on instagram who got this idea from KRV
nails on it thank you to my fellow crazy
cat ladies for inspiring me despite
being a self-professed
not so good freehand painter these were
actually pretty easy to paint I know
right weird and then I just used a nail
polish brush of course cheating anywhere
I can paint on the little eyes sliver
thingy and then add a white dot with the
dotting tool I didn't know how to draw a
tiny evil eyes on these tiny cats so I
just dotted onto mine now I added
another coat of the picture polish foil
top coat because I was really trying to
protect the foil before adding an actual
regular topcoat but then on my thumb I
added that regular quick dry top coat
over the foil and it ruined it um so
yeah what the hell man whoever said that
you can put a foil top coat and then put
on a regular quick dry top coat was
wrong my nail looks like a scaly reptile
and not in a cute way
so never mind the regular taco I think
I'll keep my hollow cat eyes Hollow
thanks these are so evil and badass I
love
I wore them for like a week I didn't
find a head any early chipping with this
top coat so that was great but then I
did this but on makeup which got into my
nails for whatever reason the baking
powder wanted to bake inside of my top
coat so then I peeled them off obviously
because they were no good for me anymore
and yeah at this time I'm not gonna play
peel porn music because this peel is not
worth the peel porn music I find one of
the things that makes your nails peel
off super satisfyingly and perfect in
one shell is when you've added a really
thick glossy top coat on top of your
nails but in this case I didn't so it
didn't peel off in one nice solid piece
I'm still gonna keep these peel ease
though follow me on Twitter and snapchat
and Instagram and Facebook and Tumblr
and YouTube and all the other places I
have things alright guys thanks so much
for watching see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
