Mar hallo well hallo everyone it's me
Christine again Happy New Year and
welcome back to my channel with by far
the best nails I've done this year thank
you thank you very much don't these rock
like a geode today's video is sponsored
ya by the popular indie polish line
cirque colors or suck if you want to be
classes that i have been a fan of since
i'd tried them in my fetus hollow sexual
days cuz i mean well hollow and now i've
got their limited edition six piece
facets collection all beautiful
scattered hollows in jelly bases with
holographic flakes and i've also got
their 2016 limited-edition holiday
collection some of which includes super
shiny reflective chrome pigments and oh
that rose gold i die
obviously you don't find this kind of
stuff at the drugstore no you find it
online check the link in the description
box I'll show you where to get these
circus made in New York City USA and
they are for free vegan and cruelty free
yay manche oh yeah look at that whole
flaky porn oh isn't it amazing that
companies still wanna sponsor me when I
talk like that
I'm in love with suss all lost alright
now let's jump right into it and do the
nails I'm starting off with a peel off a
scalp because there's gonna be peeled
board at the end of this video
no for real dough state till the end
it's really good I promise in my head I
had really wanted to do marble stone
nails that looks like a geode so I
thought why not try a water marble come
on now it's 2017 New Year maybe I can be
a witch Donald Trump is gonna be the
actual president of the USA maybe I can
water marble
ow shut up Christine and look at the
flaky spread in the water it's so
beautiful
I'll wait that's not what's supposed to
happen dammit i'ma keep on trying though
I'm not giving up I've only found like
18 different ways to cheat a water
marble but yet I'm still here not
cheating well that's not the look I was
going for oh so pretty okay I'm not
giving up damn it it's like it's frozen
I try so hard can't seem to get away
from water marble girl I try so hard I'm
not a witch I'll never be able it ain't
my fault cuz I tried to no no it
actually is my fault I just suck at this
this I'm out a con it just wasn't
the look I was going for you know when
you have something in your head and you
can't make it come to life in reality so
I tried again by doing drag marbles this
time but I'm not going for a drag marble
or even a water marble look I want like
a geode nail you know what I'm saying
with the layers of the rock but not
necessarily symmetrically marbled okay
Christine this is not working time to go
on the internet do two nail art let's
find someone who's done this better than
me hmm now see most of these look
free-handed and I'm not free hanging
 we need something easy people easy
but beautiful breezy covergirl aah Oh
exactly that's what I mean that's what's
in my head except Hollow now where does
this leave me where is the tutorial Oh
read it read it to do to do to do this
tutorial is great for explaining it oh
let's see
who do we have here it's my simple
little pleasures she once tried to teach
my boyfriend how to water marble white
touch barely touching the surface I'm
taking notes here no you're not though
it went well for him but I still never
learned in any case this is what I want
she calls it the drift marble technique
as far as I'm aware this is where this
technique first originated and I've
linked her video
down below now I'm going to show you how
I did it I'm using a yogurt lid because
what we're gonna do is we're gonna pile
a bunch of nail polish on the yogurt lid
and then move it around to make it swish
together and first we begin with one of
the hollows from the Sirk facets
collection make six large pools of your
first Hollow and add a drop of a
different color hollow in the middle of
the pools and you're going to do that
with all the different color polishes
your hollow heart desires now this does
not have to be perfect okay that's the
beauty of this technique and now for the
fun part
don't let it dry and while it's still
wet you're just gonna lift up the yogurt
lid and start tipping it around oh yeah
girl let those hollows slag oh my god
this is so mesmerizing haha who needs
therapy when you can just drip marble
hollows everywhere basically you just
keep swirling it around till you get a
pretty pattern that you're happy with
we're not dipping our finger into this
no we're going to let it dry flat on a
table just like that and then we're
going to use it as a sticker in the
meantime you can make more sticker
decals on another yogurt lid for your
other nails I'm gonna go ahead and say
this is by far one of the easiest ways
to get a marbled effect on your nails
that doesn't require water or something
very difficult pretty much anyone could
do this do you know how to pick
something up and move it around well
then you could do this even if you know
 about in hillard I feel like the
Sirk facets nail polishes already look
like gemstones in a bottle so obviously
it makes sense to turn it into a rock
looking thing when you're done you got
to let those dry into stickers that
we're gonna peel off I let mine dry for
about five hours
so go about your day mmm what should I
do let's play with some hollows look at
that beautiful icy dream this one's
winter bloom from the Cirque 20:16
holidays collection that I wasn't able
to fit into my geode look cuz I had too
many colors oh this one looks like a
vampire that sparkles Hollow and the Sun
oh it's just me now these two are the
metallics that have a beautiful foiled
chrome II look which one do you like
better the icy silvery blue chrome or
the rose gold chrome let me know in the
comments let's have a little war Wow I
don't think my nails
have ever been so sophisticated all
right let's peel them off and get back
to what we came here for five ish hours
later my decals appear to be dry I don't
want to wait an entire day or two for
them to die or else they're going to be
stiff and they're gonna crack you want
them to be just recently dried so that
they're flexible and you can peel them
up like this except that one was not
completely dry don't do that now here's
the twist I thought that the design on
top of the lid was what I would be
putting on my nails but then I flipped
it over and oh my god that looks so much
cooler beautiful beautiful little geode
and uh whoo-hoo wait a second what's
that on my other hand it's the beautiful
rose gold polish by Cirque that I've
been wearing all late last year in other
videos because I love it so much
rolls gold so sexy okay back to work
just look at the underside of the decals
that I'd created beautiful you kind of
take a chance on these because sometimes
you turn it over and it doesn't really
look that good and now we're gonna cut
them out and put them on our nail just
like stickers I'm using a peel-off base
coat to make my nails sticky you could
use a regular base coat up to you press
down the decal take an orange stick or a
toothpick and gently press around the
cuticle line so you can kind of outline
the edges of the nail could use a metal
cuticle tool to kind of cut the decal
off to size but I find if you do this
you can accidentally stab yourself so
don't do that unless it's with a
thousand degree knife you could also
take a tiny pair of scissors and cut
carefully around it use your finger or
one of your tools to help smooth out the
edges this will especially be important
if you have curved nails like mine and
the most important step to sealing the
decal on your nail is to take a cleanup
brush dipped in a bit of acetone this
kind of melts the sides of the nail
polish so that it doesn't just pop off
like a sticker and now it is one with
your nail finish off by adding a quick
dry glossy taco of your choice and bam
would you believe I did these nails
without water no free hand and no
pre-printed nail art wraps well you've
seen this video but if you hadn't I dare
you to do this drip marble technique
with hollows and then go ask your
friends and family
how they think you did it I bet you they
will have no clue if you have your eye
on these beautiful hollows and metallics
don't forget that these two collections
from Stuart colors are a limited edition
so they're only available until they're
sold out so if you're looking to grab
them get them at the link below before
they're gone for good circ also makes
some really nice creme polishes if
you're into that including their
bestseller that also happens to be my
favorite one KOTOR black creme polish as
you may have seen compete with other
black polishes and by what's the best
black polish video but I know what
you're really holding out for a girl you
want to see that peel pour oh yeah
peeling that gemstone right off my nails
hey now they're like a collector's item
he flipped them over you see the other
side of the pattern of the drip marble
that I didn't end up using that's so
cool dude alright guys that's all I got
for you today since it is the beginning
of the year why don't you guys leave me
some comments down below
