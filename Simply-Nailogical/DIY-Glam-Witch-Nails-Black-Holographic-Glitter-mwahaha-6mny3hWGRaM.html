already pay myself today
I'm a witch bitch bitch I'm a witch
bitch I'm a witch bitch that could go on
forever as you very well know Halloween
is upon us
and so I thought I'd show you these
witchy witch nails in case you want to
do them yourself for Halloween or any
other time of the year it's up to you
now the first step to being a witch with
these claws is to get some fake nails
that are very pointy a very long that
will send people running far away from
you when you say you want to be their
friend I have too many of these packages
because they kept sending the wrong ones
and yes my nail pili popped off if
you're a part of simply snap squad you
would already know this follow me on
snapchat bitch also if you haven't seen
my Halloween vinyls nail art video then
you should go watch it right after this
so despite my best efforts these are the
wrong kind of fake nail they're called
half tips because they only are supposed
to go to half your nail and that's why
they're not rounded out like you would
expect them to be to fit at the base of
your nail your cuticle so we're just
gonna fix that by cutting them and
shaping them ourselves cuz I don't got
time for this shit Amazon they're
perfect sure don't you want me to be
your nail tech now if you actually want
to wear these nails out of the house all
night then you should be using a form of
nail glue not what I'm using which is
peel off base coat so I can get these
the fuck off of me right away I'm
pressing them down as if it was glue and
pretending like these heavy motherfuckin
fake nails are going to stick now we're
going to paint our long ass nails black
this is my favorite black polish
recently I made a video about that too
you should also watch that and the time
that it took me to paint this one now I
probably could have gone to polish
mountain and now for the best part we're
going to sponge on some black hollow
whit
if you're new here black challah which
is one of my collaboration nail polishes
because I was like why the fuck is there
no black hollow glitter polishes there
needs to be one now there is one your
darkest most fucked up dreams and
prayers have been answered
you are welcome so while I was dab dab
dab it on my nail started to pop off
yeah about that the funk soul brother
what so add another coat of black
challah which just make it all smooth
extra hollow for the win and the last
step is to add a nice thick coat of
glossy taco so you can shine like the
witchy bitch that you are am I supposed
to wrap the tips of these I don't know
they're so pointy I've never experienced
this before just for fun uh here's how
much the fake nails don't fit my nails
my nails are obviously very curvy and
these fake nails do not fit my curves
they are obviously shaming the curviness
of my nails I am offended but who black
olives Beckley you who pretty and dark
and awesome and evil and huh this black
hollow gives me life I mean it gives me
death okay the next step to having witch
hands is to put a bunch of shit all over
your hand to make it look weird or scary
these are fake temporary tattoos I got
them somewhere from the Internet's I put
the link below are they supposed to be
henna I'm not sure are these patterns
henna eye you're asking the wrong person
okay all I know is that they were black
and kind of mysterious looking with
their shapes so that's why I decided
they made sense for this which hand look
okay if I am wrong and they happen to
represent a religion or something that
I'm unaware of and I have offended
people I apologize in advance but it's
Halloween so give me a fuckin break you
know how to apply temporary tattoos
right or do I need to tell you are you
even watching this video to get actual
information on how to do this look or
are you just watching this video because
you don't know why you have no conclude
peel off the backing of the temporary
tattoo after I drowned it in water
that's right witches you heard me I said
water we're going to see if you float
and if you don't float then then you're
just gonna die sorry Oh people were so
until
legend centuries ago okay so just keep
adding those black fancy looking
temporary tattoos up your fingers there
actually was a legitimate trend recently
called cuticle tattoos where you would
put a tattoo right by your cuticle down
your finger since I didn't have any more
of those fancy swirly ones I'm going to
use these triangular ones cut it to size
now we got to make sure this one's good
because it's on my middle finger which
is the finger that most people see peel
it off and oh that's like gray that's
not very black moving on let's add this
moon and circle side thing can we please
not pay attention to my other hand today
because it is looking ratchet and I am
highly embarrassed thank you I am
obviously showing you all the peel shots
because you come for the nails you stay
for the peel porn and there you have it
my hand is ready to scare your parents
and now I have truly become a black
hollow witch now watch me struggle
trying to pose with my black hollow
witch black color glitter polish it was
very difficult to do this what the fuck
not even going to try and wipe my ass
nope I am NOT since I used to peel off
base coat these came off way too easy
but if you want to wear fake nails and
you don't want to use nail glue because
that's a bitch to take off try using
double-sided tape I was surprised how it
actually works pretty well yes if you
push it hard enough it's gonna pop off
but I don't think it's sticky or strong
grip enough to cause damage to your nail
bed and that's what most people complain
about when they use nail glue because no
glue is really just superglue under a
different name and you want to keep your
natural nails on fleek you know what I'm
saying
yay oh nice and yellow like candy corn
oh I'm so sexy when I'm naked
okay everyone that wraps it up I hope
you have a bitchin Halloween and
remember to stay safe and eat all the
candy thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all at about
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
