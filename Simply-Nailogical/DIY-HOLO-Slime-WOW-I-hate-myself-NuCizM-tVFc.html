hello everyone it's me Christine again
so many of you guys like so many
requested that I do a slime video but
not just any slime hollows why because
what is the point of slime and to not
Hollow
right so I did a lot of research I
watched a fuckload of DIY slime videos
on YouTube it was a great learning
experience and here we have all the
ingredients I wasn't sure about that
borax bullshit so I'm going to try
another methods we got sensitive eyes
saline solution I don't know what that
is for baking soda I also don't know
what that is for measuring cups clear
glue long as I'm not putting it around
my hand food coloring mixing utensils
and bowls and shit and less than at
least an assortment of hollow glitter
well some of them are just glitter
they're not hollow but we're not going
to use those apparently slime videos are
one of the top growing trends of 2017
that's right kid
slime is in fashion wear it on your head
and although we all know that I'm quite
the fashionable person already
I gotta get with the trend and make a
pink slime video I wrote down some notes
on the back of these passive-aggressive
notepads
crying a little bit extra cook just to
keep you on edge
so people do this check it out finally I
can call myself essentially slime logic
I've waited so long can you hear it
unfortunately the lighting is not
optimal for holo so let me make it good
for you that my friends is how you make
slime oh my god I just had a brilliant
idea what if we mix the three hollows
fun together
lay them all side by side let's just
twist them or some shit - big evolve for
me to work with you know how hard is
this to mush slime around with nails I'm
gonna have to punch you instead you got
a need it you know what I don't need in
my life
slime DIYs there now looks like a galaxy
safe
well this is fun
I'm also never doing this again because
didn't you know DIYs are dead hallelujah
all right now that we've got our amazing
looking hollow galaxy slime what am I
supposed to do with it
hold on a second let me ask you tube ten
things to do with your DIYs line no no
no this is just how to make fun I'm
going to know what to do with it what
the fuck do I do with this so let me get
this straight
there's millions of tutorials on how to
DIY your own slime but there's nothing
on what the fuck to do with it what do I
do with this now internet look what is
up I mean really like who makes a video
with no point to it with that want to
touch it with your bean toes don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
more great content thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all next Lamba
