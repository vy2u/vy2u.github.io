well hello everyone it's me Christine
again eh eh now that's one Canadian
stereotype I actually live up to
recently I've been seeing a lot of is
Canada even real means where people who
live on tumblr comment on a number of
practices that supposedly take place in
Canada as if Canada were some kind of
carefree theme park that was just too
good and just too fun to be real
you are fake news I'm here to tell you
that Canada is Canada actually exists in
fact I'm literally in Canada right now
at this very moment
specifically in Ottawa Canada which is
the capital of Canada it just so happens
that our Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's
house is just a short drive away from me
I'm not even kidding
okay odd it was pretty small now one
name in particular that caught my
attention was the maple syrup
taffy on snow me on tumblr of course
that's where all the deep thinking goes
on you better not be fucking with me
Canada is this for real it is all too
real and so I saw a few of you tweeting
me asking me if this was actually real
and I replied confirmed every winter
there was some kind of winter festival
where there would be a maple taffy booth
and they would just pour it on the snow
and you buy it on a stick for like $2
and you know what that's what we're
gonna do today it's a maple taffy
tutorial bitch
hey do you like my pants it's really
quite simple all you need is maple syrup
and it has to be 100% pure maple syrup
not that Aunt Jemima fakes are a
bullshit okay no it's not the real shit
don't even bother you're also gonna need
a pot and I don't mean the kind of pot
that's gonna be legalized across the
whole country this year haha is Canada
even real some popsicle sticks a candy
thermometer or something that you can
dip into the syrup to read the
temperature
fresh snow and it's got to be fresh a
baking pan or some kind of wide tray to
lay the snow in a stove or a heat plate
and lastly and most importantly you're
gonna need an adult to supervise because
before the maple syrup gets cold it's
gonna get hot so Man Man Man Man
I'm ready that one get the snow honestly
you don't use the yellow snow okay or
the dirty snow on Twitter I saw a lot of
comments of people confused about why
you would use snow as if snow itself is
unsanitary I kind of get the
misunderstanding maybe in some countries
or places where there's less snow all
the snow you get turns dirty like in the
street with cars but in Canada you have
so much fresh snow to work with this
shit ain't dirty it's fresh from the sky
now that we freshly packed the snow
we're just gonna leave it here so that
it's ready for when we need it
once we heat up the maple syrup okay I'm
cold
let's go inside step 2
or the real maple syrup in a pot no
measuring required just kind of guess
how much you want to enough to have a
sugar high turn your stove on and turn
it on high then you gotta wait until it
comes to a boil now you gotta be careful
because this shit bubbles up when it's
hot you don't want to let it overflow or
you will have a very sticky mess on your
hands so you want to heat the maple
syrup to 235 degrees Fahrenheit because
that is the perfect temperature for
making maple taffy starting to smell so
good we gotta be safe no kids in the
kitchen okay we're just gonna pull you
over here in your pumpkin there we go
okay then I'm gonna let you do this one
oh yeah yeah
nice good technique have you done this
before every Canadian has it stripped me
on the side it's fine the really hot
maple syrup is hitting the snow it's
starting to solidify so it's getting
harder
so you stir finchy see the kids love it
ready for the fun part it's where we get
to roll one so you got to stick your
stick in and then you're gonna roll it
up oh no I missed some of it I got to do
this kind of quickly I think we waited a
little too long but this is also thing
that people do they just leave it right
in the snow and then they literally eat
it like this yeah the snow actually sort
of adds to it it's like not a bad thing
to get like some of the crystals snow on
it you can also make snow cones like
this it's stuck in my knees again - hate
me that's why we have free health care
here our teeth are ruined by maple
toffee anyway this is super easy to do
we just messed up in the sense that
you're supposed to pour and then
immediately roll it on to your pops you
talk too much been balling who are you
pointing at me in the middle
hey babe I ganging up this is how you
make boys stick in Canada simply sugar
shack I make you maple toffee on a stick
only 50 cents enough to have an
appreciation for the real shit if you
tried to make this with Aunt Jemima
bullshit well first of all I don't think
it would work because of science and
chemical composition but second of all
that shit is garbage doesn't that stuff
just like corn syrup it tastes so bad
Jemima I love Canada that's pretty nice
they also do this kind of stuff in the
northern states of Vermont Michigan I
think there is a maple syrup industry
there too but 70% of the world's maple
syrup apparently comes from Quebec which
is the French province of Canada do you
know that it's important or
internationally important statistic I'm
ganna die it was actually like a maple
syrup cartel and like a black market
that's all the crime we have in Canada
it's just dealing with this from the
black market no this is from legitimate
sources this way can't stop eating it
help me are we done well this was yummy
a very tasty play hockey after this
let's go get a beaver table let's let's
go get a beaver tail it's about a boot
time no one's feeling that I've
literally never heard someone say a boot
but a absolutely is true we use it as an
expression hearing I say it a lot it's
like you're gonna get me my tea later
hey hey she's looking man she no stop it
that's for mommy it's mommy's breakfast
lunch and dinner hey hey
it's like saying right right ain't that
right yes cream on sheet well pity shoe
shoes save Rebecca beaucoup de Jonge
okay
pase no part to the moon dead complete
marveling come watching we should give
you lessons later okay finally I can
teach you something can I see your
wallet what for Donetsk why students I
got to pay the maple syrup dealer bags
now another is Canada even real type
theme I've seen a lot of it's about our
Canadian money it's so amazing that it
does many magic tricks such as it's kind
of indestructible you can't rip this
literally cannot rip the Canadian dollar
bills actually we don't even have dollar
bills okay we have five dollars and
that's the minimum Looney tune you do
feel good I'm a loony I got loonies and
toonies the other magical thing about
Canadian money is that it's Hollow
look at that shit okay we got the
Queen's face and she's rainbows you also
have colorful money like it's not all
just like this no it's like this binge
and another reason why Canadian money is
so magical that tumblr cannot believe is
that their waterproof
I just thought your money should go for
a little dip just a corner look how much
YouTube money you think we have we could
just be ripping up dollar bills on
camera it is true that this is worth
like five dollars Canadian Canadian
money even when it's less because where
it seems like you had scissors you could
cut this I know but most people don't
intentionally cut money it's an accident
let's hear a savage how do we get you
deported the last magical fun fact about
Canadian money is that allegedly they
smell like maple syrup is Canada even
real I've never heard it kind of does
but we also have yeah they definitely do
have a bit of like a synthetic sweet
smell to them it's straight earlier in
the day before we opened up any maple
syrup I swear to God we both agreed that
it kind of smelled like I'm sure it's
all in our head no no no no no let me
get you an internet resource so a lot
it's really quite fascinating because I
thought that was just bullshit like
someone just said that I would money
smelling maple syrup that's just stupid
waste of money to make something scented
like that but in 2013 the National Post
which is a major newspaper in Canada
wrote an article called scratch and
sniff cash this is real news in Canada I
would like to know once and for all if
these bills are in fact sent it says an
email from a perplexed citizen for the
record bank official Jeremy Harrison
says no scent has been added to the
banknotes I think it's all in your head
when you're told something is going to
smell like maple syrup then you smell it
you want it to smell like this yeah yes
listen to these people I could smell the
scent once but not all the time I bet a
couple friends that cannot find proof is
it just me who's writing the Bank of
Canada to ask this the Bank of Canada
initially withheld all the public
respondents about the new polymer bank
notes citing privacy concerns Trump
never tweeted about it how will we know
if it's fake news think I'm a figure you
know what if your hand is real no in
Canada instead of laundering money
organized crime just washes the money in
maple syrup and puts it back into
circulation a snow watch that money in a
mixer Oh make that money oh yeah okay
are we done here you've just learned the
history of Canada simply 53 less than
101
actually I've seen some of you guys
tweet me examples of when you had a
history project to do on a different
country other than yours people chose
Canada and they would like put a picture
of me to represent not superwoman she
lives in the US now she left she's a
traitor
all those Canadian youtubers leave
they're all moving to a nice we are in
the gold I just don't really fit in in
LA not sure why is it cuz you're a song
I mess up all right well if you haven't
subscribed to my channel yet it's a boot
time age alright everybody thanks so
much for watching and we'll see y'all
later
