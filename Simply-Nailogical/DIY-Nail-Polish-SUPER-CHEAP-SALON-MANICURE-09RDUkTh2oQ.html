Christine again and welcome to another
video with my face in it this time I
admit I didn't put that much effort into
my face they're too big for me these
come in different sizes sorry to
disappoint you did put on some
highlighter though can you see if you
see it you see are we not I'm so pale
today I'm gonna do something that I
thought I would never do yeah I white
nail-polish DIY do it yourself do it
yourself
yes that's Rupert's nail polish I can't
wait the Christine yeah why is our older
age on YouTube didn't you know this this
is going to be great please subscribe
and alright first I do a makeup tutorial
and now I do a DIY video must be having
a youtube identity crisis help me so
I've seen a few just a few DIYs on
YouTube myself and yeah I think that
DIYs have gone from actually helpful
home and garden home projects and such
to what the actual fuck to prepare for
this video I'm watching a DIY right now
I this squishy thing is so useful
you're right back I'm going to make this
myself right away
there's some other potential useful DIY
videos looks like hello ma fille dyed
her nails with kool-aid oh yeah Corinna
Garcia put lipstick on her nails now I
know what to do with all that makeup I
just bought whit her forever maid KFC's
edible nail polish hey I emailed KFC for
their nail polish and they never
answered me maybe Breeland can send me
hers and Natalie's outlet did some dumb
as fuck nail hacks it's nice to see
someone is taking this as seriously as I
am found myself a troll buddy actually
all of those are related to nails maybe
they might be useful I don't know I
haven't seen them yet I don't see you
guys wash them let me know below in the
comments always wondered though when
glitter forever 17 named herself -
chimney hollow glitter or just glitter
glitter live questions I need answered
before I die okay now it's time to begin
which one of you wants to be my
volunteer okay you want to play you
wanna play some games yeah we could be
like the movie sock
put this in your stomach that's really
fucked up Christine first I should put
my hair up because shits gonna get messy
ooh maybe next I'll do a hair tutorial
yeah so many good ideas to make your own
nail polish
you won't need nail polish the irony I
know
bunch of eyeshadow you don't care about
anymore or buy some new ones that you
don't mind smashing into tiny little
pieces a hammer to do said smashing a
total thing to excavate the eyeshadow
pigment cup for water marbling some
loose hollow glitter so you can actually
sit through this video because there
will be sparkles let's do this bitch
steam doesn't herself part one okay
we're gonna need two cameras up and yes
y'all can see exactly what I'm doin so I
have these really old eyeshadow palettes
that's not a pallet eyeshadow single
eyeshadow things I have green pink
yellow brown and fur ball used to have a
blue but then I smashed it from my
makeup for no I legit bought these 15
years ago they say holographic on them I
must have been hollow sexual my entire
life first you're going to pick a collar
paper color any color let's pick this
one because it's called Palace sunset
romantic motherfucker you're gonna take
your clear nail polish that you had to
have bought at the store oh you're the
way is now it's time to break things
take out your anger on the YouTube where
you hate the most
just whatever you do don't hold the
container with your hand in your nails
cuz then you might smash your nails but
I would have to have a funeral so no yes
die woo and you have take a piece of
paper got to include that in the things
you will need list and you're going to
roll yourself a little doobie and stick
it into the bottle in there and start
pouring this shit in oh this is so messy
Christine stop concentrating so hard
people will think you're being serious
aw dammit none of it went in it will
fuck that thing I'm just gonna pile it
in myself I shadow is everywhere except
on my eyes and you're gonna close your
bottle that's time to shake that shit up
and look at that like a highlighter for
your nails let's test it shall we
are you ready that was too much I can't
really see it did I mention that these
were edible Baba this is not a very
efficient method look I'm gonna make my
own nail polish what because I don't
have enough so I thought I should make
my own that's a good idea
I know right kind of got duochrome eh
look but definitely not hollow Oriole
you don't know what hollow means
obviously yeah so this application is
great on the first coat but a beautiful
purple that is so I got some of this
loose hollow glitter that I think it's
from Halloween 2002 and we're just gonna
tap it and just tap it and hollows
really stand out in it and I think it
has a great smooth finish on the nail
stop looking at my thumb okay stop
looking at my thumb I didn't make that
nail polish I made this nail polish this
black hollow polish is called black
hollow which cuz I named it obviously
and I had someone who actually makes
nail polish for a living make them but
I'm pretty sure I can make one just as
good let's try I love a challenge
well we mustn't spill you sacred black
hollow which don't come after me
how did it get so liquidy where did I go
wrong I know let's mix colors free in
this yellowy gold color add some holo to
it tell a piece flying everywhere not
that I have a problem with that um yeah
so just keep in mind that the polish I
was going for was a really green
Shrek II color maybe if I made this
bottle into a big jelly sized thing that
I could cut up I would be the next big
DIY er wow that looks so great
I am legit obsessed obsessed obsessed
with this look aren't you guys you guys
must be so obsessed ooh I almost forgot
to do my thumb don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you are gonna do it
yourself
alright since I just made myself four
amazing nail polishes why don't we
compare them to real nut polish and see
just how good a job I did yes so there's
a lot of Hollow and the one that I
bought from the store but you can still
see the hollows in mind if you look
really closely okay they're in there I
swear I did do for making a green hollow
not bad right not bad not bad not bad at
all real nail polish may look way more
hollow but it's just the shape of the
bottle okay if mine was in a square
bottle it would look just as good oh wow
what happened there oh I don't think to
the bottom no that's not supposed to
happen and there you have it DIY nail
polish no never do this first of all
looks like shit second of all you
literally would have just bought nail
polish to make nail polish that looks
worse than actual nail polish that you
could buy for less money than what you
spent on the amount of products to make
the nail polish that you just made in
your DIY I wasn't really long and
confusing sentence Christine even adding
hollow to it didn't make it good it's
just sad because hollow usually makes
everything better there are some things
you just shouldn't make yourself this is
one of them so after this experiment
I've decided that I'm not going to
become a DIY Channel nope I'm gonna most
DIYs are fucking dumb and no I'm also
not becoming a makeup Channel cause you
are so gullible
who knows maybe I will
take another random weird-ass
unsolicited video if you like that feel
free to be my friend and subscribe I'm
done with you thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
