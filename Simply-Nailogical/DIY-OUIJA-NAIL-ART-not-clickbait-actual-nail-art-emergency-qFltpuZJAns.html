go hello everyone it's me Christine
again and Minji today we're gonna show
you how to do these spooky a Ouija board
nails so you can communicate with the
spirit world this Halloween and after
you're done watching this video make
sure you go watch my other video where I
force been into contacting spirits with
the a Ouija board the link is down below
and as for the nail art this took me
like six hours though okay I tried
really hot first we start off with a
peel off base coat it's invisible just
like ghosts oh shit we got a man she
hair next we're gonna paint our nails
with a smooth black linear hollow polish
and we're gonna use two to three coats
for full opacity for an accent now I
went with a light ivory cream now add a
nice thick coat of glassy choco and this
isn't just because I really enjoy adding
nice thick coats of glossy taco okay
this is actually a very important step
in order to do what we're about to do
next now it's really important that you
let that glossy talk a fully dry out
even if you're using a super quick
drying high quality ceiling glossy taco
like the one I use I would still
recommend waiting like half an hour to
an hour because you want it to be
completely completely dry because if
it's not fully dry you won't be able to
do the toothpick trick which is very
important if you don't know how to
freehand and you draw like shit alright
first I'm gonna take some white acrylic
paint here's a quick tip if your brush
is frayed out like mine just add some
nail oil to it I use my handy little pen
you should all have made one of those by
now because you all watched my how to
grow your nails video right now I'm
trying to paint the Sun on my middle
nail well half of the face of the Sun
and this will be a challenge because I
am NOT the best at free handing anything
art
thank God for the toothpick trick
because the glossy taco is fully sealed
I am easily able to scratch off acrylic
paint before you let it dry lots of
people ask if you can do this with nail
polish and no you cannot because nail
polish won't scratch off and if you use
acetone then well you'll just ruin
everything underneath of it
acrylic paint is also much easier to
work with when you're doing detail to
freehand work I mean not that I do it
that often but when I have basically if
you suck at art like me but you really
want to try drawing something on your
nail then use acrylic paint okay fuck
nail polish never thought I would say
that but in this context it's okay okay
I do not know how to draw faces but what
does the Sun have on its face in the
picture it looks like she's got some
wrinkles you see the Sun don't need no
Botox because she's out living her best
life there we go we got some big cheeks
that's cute to make my oh we do board
nails more authentic-looking
I now take the ivory creme polish and
paint it over top of the white acrylic
paint if you screw this part off you
won't be able to scratch it off so don't
fuck it up okay
after several long minutes of not
breathing I think I somewhat pulled this
off whew okay let's move on to the next
nail now we're gonna draw the moon this
time with some black acrylic paint and
I'm breaking out the toothpick already
yes don't judge me drawing the moon's
profile was particularly tricky um I
just kind of sat there with my
paintbrush with hesitation for a long
time how do I proceed
damn this moons brows are slaying and
yeah those are supposed to be lips not a
ballsack how did that happen and then a
name of fitting in with the skinny
little lines aesthetic on the game board
I drew some skinny little lines on my
nails okay onto the pointer now which I
thought would be best suited to be the
OE drew pointer so basically take your
white acrylic paint and draw a heart
sort of then take some of that ivory
boring creme polish and cover up the
white heart now we're gonna start
building the magical ball in the middle
okay I know like the real pointer is
just a glass see-through thing but I for
some reason thought it would look cooler
is like a magic 8-ball hold on a second
because then I got carried away and
decided to try and spell out Luigi with
a paintbrush and it didn't look like a
weed yeah it looked more like oh oh no
look at that you can't scratch the
acrylic paint off of nail polish I don't
even listen to my own advice I tried to
save it okay I was desperate to save
this because this has already taken me
so long but it deserved to die
you know really I just didn't want to
disrespect the ghosts or the oeg ghosts
because I wrote her name dim ugly okay
we just used some white acrylic paint
like white out and covered back up with
creme pretend like it never happened
let's move on to another part of the
nail I've thought it would be cool for
the little eight-ball thingy to have a
multi chrome base so when you move it
around it's all shifty and 3d looking
and then of course how could we forget
adding some hilum taco so this is a
holographic flake topcoat so it's a bit
chunkier than your average hollow
topcoat you'll see in a bit how I'm
gonna turn this into a magic ball but
first I added a glassy taco to the heart
part in hopes of smoothing it out so I
could attempt to write oaj again
everyone please say a prayer for me dear
ghosts of Oita please let me write out
your name perfectly
okay I had to do the rest off camera
because the angle is just so hard to
follow we can breathe now after that I
was overconfident and added I don't know
what the fall this is supposed to be it
looks like blinking lights that are
screaming help me why did you just this
up after all of this effort undo undo
undo undo if only it was that easy okay
here we go again Christine let's keep it
simple so then I took a dotting tool and
just added some dots all around that
mystery sphere in the middle to kind of
bring the whole a we'd two board
together finally we're gonna add a nice
thick coat of glassy taco because I need
some good positive energy okay and after
about 16 layers of paint it still it'll
actually looks good it's really smooth
thank God
let's add a nice thick coat of glossy
taco to all of our nails mmm don't
forget to wrap the tip wouldn't want the
spirits to get out and here's what I did
on my pinky it's a pentagram which
actually makes no appearance on that we
do board I just thought it looked cool
and dark and evil okay now we're going
to make this ball pop and we do that by
adding a little drop of gel polish and
then curing it under a lamp
so it becomes a bit raised on the nail
and then we're going to repeat that a
couple times so we can build it up a
little higher because I want people to
be able to rub the ball then it'll be
like hey I can tell your future just rub
my a ouija ball on my pointer nail ha ha
and then and then they run away so I
kind of fucked up here and I put way too
much gel taco so it kind of ran down
like a melting iceberg oops but it's
clear so no one will notice hopefully
and there we have it a weed zaborg
actual nail art and check out my thumb
you like my nails bitch yes or no the
black hollow underneath is pretty subtle
so I'm adding my iPhone flash here so it
really comes to life in to be honest I'm
really digging this jabal see how the
polish at the very bottom kind of shifts
because it's a multi chrome and then the
hollow flake taco adds a whole new
dimension when it moves around in the
ball I wonder if ghosts like Hollow
if they do then I will be their friend
now remember how I painted my nails with
the glossy taco before I put the acrylic
paint on want to know something cool
that was a black light activated glossy
taco now Maya we genell's can glow in
the dark so the ghost can find me and
then we can blade together at night yes
the effect looks much better on the
thumb and the ring finger and that's
because those nails were a really light
base coat with black acrylic on top of
the black light activated glass attack
up there so many words English the other
ones are a little muddy or looking but
whatever it's so cool okay they're
glowing
