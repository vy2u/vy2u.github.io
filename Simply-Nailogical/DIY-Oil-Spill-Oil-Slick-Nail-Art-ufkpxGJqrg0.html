and it feels so weird because it's been
so long since I've done a regular nail
art tutorial I've done a lot of randoms
comedic recently drama
John the broom bad shot you'll have to
excuse me I have to get rid of my system
sometimes anyways I'm back with some
actual nail art today so let's get
cereal I'm starting off naked like I
usually do but I quickly wanted to
address the break that didn't become a
break on the side of my nail just over a
month ago I posted a video on how I
almost broke my nail but it didn't
actually break you can go watch that
other video if you want to see the
horror story anyways what looks like a
nail fracture if that's the thing has
grown out quite a bit right now but it
still hasn't actually split like the
nail is not detached where you see that
line it's still completely together I
know it's really weird you'll already
know what saved my life if you watched
my other video and starting off with a
peel off base coat like I do most of the
time because I want to save this man
here and put it in my creepy bag okay I
took notes from you guys and I actually
found wet and wild black creme nail
polish while I was visiting Florida when
I posted my what's the best black nail
polish from a drugstore video a bunch of
you said I should have tried this and so
now I'm trying it and I'm not very
excited with what I'm seeing no what is
this no matter what color your natural
nail whether it's yellow light pink
Smurf blue whatever you probably want a
black polish that covers the nail in one
coat because it's black which means it's
the darkest shade of all which means it
should be the most opaque so why aren't
you doing your job it's totally possible
that some of you out there have had this
polish and it's opaque for you but
that's one of the problems with math
traduz nail polish sometimes there's
batch inconsistencies and I guess I got
a shitty batch now on to more important
things rainbows rainbows
we're gonna do some rainbow nails I've
been wanting to try oil spill slash oil
slick nails for a really long time now
but I could not find what the hell to
use to put on my nails to make it look
like that and then the unicorns must
have spoken to me because I randomly
stumbled upon these nail foils called
rainbow swirl which I found from like
the cheapest nail store ever I put the
link down below and this is where we
take a piss charlie it's a magical
rainbow of hope and Wonder and urine you
basically just take this roll of foil
and cut it up into little pieces that
kind of take your nail but I seem to be
having technical difficulties because I
can't even use these scissors correctly
ah there we go
use Russian magical scissors and all
your scissor problems are solved you do
not have to cut them up to fit your nail
exactly they can be a bit bigger you'll
see why soon next you're going to need
some foil glue I got mine at the same
place I got the foils now I've used foil
glue before but this foil glue is very
different because if you look at it very
carefully you will see that it has
special magical powers or it looks like
I'm shining one of those CSI lights that
they use to detect sperm on it but I
have no such light why does it look like
it's radioactive so weird now you need
to apply this mystery elixir on your
nail very carefully and thin even coats
are also kind of pools at the tip of my
nail like you're seeing that I
accidentally did when the glue is
completely dry it will turn clear and
when that happens you can go ahead and
press the full right on don't smoosh it
around on your nail gently press it down
once and oh what's on my other hand this
is a very strange sighting coming from
simply illogical it's brown shimmer gel
polish that was not applied very well
what all will make sense in a future
video continue to smooth out the foil
around your nail and if your nails are
very curved like mine that you're gonna
have to press around the edges as you
keep pressing it down you'll see that
the plastic part of the foil will start
to lift off your nail when you feel like
you press down everywhere peel back that
backing and I didn't get everywhere you
can sort of go back and fill in any
spaces that you have missed but it
depends on
the end result look you're going for in
this case it kind of messed it up a
little because it's not the exact same
color of oil spill in that location but
I'm not redoing that nail so let's just
try it again on a different nail and see
if we get different results and this
time around I just wanted to show you
guys how cool this blue stuff looks I
need this white stuff that looks blue
over black when it dries yeah
look at that time left I'm pretty sure
this would glow under a black light
be right back gotta buy a black light it
just dawned on me that using nail foil
for your entire nail is like nail art
for lazy people but hey I mean art is
art a foil is a foil and unicorns are
unicorns sometimes I make sense in my
head and peel it off and bam what a
shiny
I forgot to scrape off the glue before
hehehe and that was one of the most
easiest nail arts I've ever done on this
channel there's actually no orange in
the foil it was just a reflection of the
t-shirt I was wearing at the time but
just something to note generally about
these kinds of foils is that they look
best in indirect light meaning you don't
want to be shining a ball bright on them
because then you're gonna get these
glare patches so you want to angle my
nails back a bit and the light isn't
shining directly on them you can see the
oil spill pattern more clearly and now
the number one challenge of using nail
foils is what topcoat can I put over
these without ruining them you know what
time it is
it's experiment time it is time to do
experiments and I just very quickly say
though how frustrating it is to try and
angle the paper correctly so that the
lights knock everything up anyways I got
it so what I'm showing you right now is
trying out a bunch of different glossy
top coats I'm not going to list every
single one I tried because I don't
remember but the point of this
experiment is to see if any of them
don't make the foil crack like you're
seeing on the screen they're all
cracking I even tried a real gel polish
top coat thinking it might be inherently
different because of the formula but it
still made the foil crack nothing is
working must do more experiments another
random top coat clear polish but not a
top coat yellow stop
which is supposed to be a base coat a
regular clear base coat and they all
 with the foil in their own ways
so I decided to try some hollow top
coats here's one super disperse
scattered hollow top coat here's a bit
more dense hollow top coat and another
hollow top coat and as far as I can see
it was a bit easier to tell in person
than on camera every single thing I
tried made the foil crack so basically I
gave in and just decided to try yellow
stopper on top of the foil because I
thought it was kind of cool and it gave
it a little bit of a bluish tint but
then on my other now I thought well
let's just try a hollow top coat I'm
using this one and then see how they
compare because they're still rules that
all your nails need to be done the exact
same way you can see the obvious blue
tinge that the yellow stopper gave the
nail on my right but I think it looks
pretty cool and obviously would look
cooler if I put a hollow topcoat on top
of that I can't help it it's my hollow
sexual tendencies add a final glossy top
coat on top of everything because I
don't know I just had a habit of doing
that to make everything super shiny and
this looks badass as
this isn't just an oil spill anymore
it's an oil spill inside a galaxy yeah
even though the combination of top coats
and I put on top of my nail at the
end did make the foil crack it didn't
dull it still very shiny and maybe
that's because the final top coat I put
on top I'm not sure but I would like to
put it out there that if you guys know
of a glossy top coat that does not crack
foils please let me know in the comments
because I've been really feeling soil
nails lately and on another note I just
want to say thank you guys so much for
500,000 holo sexuals all to be fair
maybe not all of you are homosexuals but
if you aren't and I will surely convert
you soon I do plan on having a massive
think you giveaway but I'm probably
going to coordinated with my 1 million
followers on
so Graham whatever that happened so make
sure you're following me on Instagram
because that's probably where I'm going
to announce it so it's a little easier
to run giveaways that way but it's gonna
be great and jam-packed with holo of
course so thanks so much for watching
then I'll see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
