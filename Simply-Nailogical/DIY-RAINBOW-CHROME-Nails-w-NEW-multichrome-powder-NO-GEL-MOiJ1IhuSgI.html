again and oh look it's that silver
chrome powder pigment stuff you've been
seeing everywhere on YouTube now I know
all of y'all have been tweeting at me
and snapchat and me and all the all
doing all the things to me to do these
chrome nails so here they are but I'm
bored I mean they're just shiny silver
the silver chrome let's get some rainbow
magic color shift in Chrome's yes so
today I'm gonna show you the same kind
of chrome irreflexive stuff you've been
seeing everywhere in silver but in multi
chrome colors and I am so excited and
the best part is this is using regular
nail polish and no gel so this company
send me all this professional I
don't know why
including this gel lamp which plugs into
none of the outlets on the entire
continent on which I live what is this
I've never seen it before I tried to
swap out the cord and it doesn't fit
anyways
struggles aside let's look at the
beautiful rainbows oh my god they're so
pretty
which one's your favorite guys
don't know about you but this is the
kind of powder I want to put up my nose
but seriously what is this witchcraft oh
my god it's red
oh my god it's green oh my god it's red
again it must be Christmas I'm gonna try
this out first with gel polish and then
with regular polish let's get started so
I'm going to start off doing it the
traditional way and that is to use gel
polish and thanks to my other
experimental video I know that I can use
a peel-off base coat under these gel
nails next step is some black gel polish
now I am not used to applying gel okay I
find it weird that it never dries it's
just weird it's unnatural okay so I put
it under my lamp that isn't the lamp the
company sent me this will come into play
later after that's cured cured from what
disease I don't know I'm applying a
second coat of black gel polish here the
disease one more time then we're gonna
add a gel polish taco now that's simply
no logical ish for gel polish top coat
for those who are new here you should
really subscribe and get to know the
weird ways in which I talk and we gonna
bake that one more time now
I'm adding some liquid latex around my
nail before I put the powder
everywhere because I thought it would
minimize the mess of the powder look it
dried all by itself yay next I'm using
this really cool silicone tool I really
love the feeling of this it was so
squishy but firm at the same time and
we're just gonna scoop up the multi
chrome powder oh my god my words cannot
explain how satisfying this was
No look guys it's green and then it's
purple and then it's green again Oh
color shifting unicorns take me now then
according to the instructions are
supposed to use it to gently but sort of
firmly press down the powder into your
nail in this case you're pressing it
into the gel topcoat so I did this for
like a really long time and I never saw
my reflection where's my face I cannot
see it after a while I just gave up and
peeled off simply peel Lac no big de
yell because I needed to do something
that felt good I thought maybe adding a
final glossy gel taco would make it
reflective but it just made it glossy
what the hell man what the hell this
does not look like those pictures I've
seen they're super multi chromey and
color shifting so that's obviously
working actually as they are now they
remind me of already-existing multi
chrome polish I have many of them but
they ain't reflective like a mirror so
I'm gonna peel them off and try again
while I do this I'll let you guys know
that I did contact the company and I was
like it's not working why isn't it
working I don't see my face and we went
over the steps that I took to get this
and yeah I did something wrong of course
apparently it really matters what type
of UV lamp you use because the one they
sent me that I couldn't use because of
the plug is supposed to work with their
particular topcoat but I use their
topcoat and another random gel UV light
that obviously didn't operate at the
same light frequency I don't know okay
it's like science in a nutshell the
powder didn't get reflective because the
gel topcoat under it wasn't properly
cured it obviously still had a disease I
hope to get the right lamp to do this
again with gel because that's the way
it's supposed to be done so make sure
you follow me on snapchat and Twitter
and I'll update you guys if I try it
again but the good news is for now I got
it to work with regular polish so I'm
starting off again with a peel off base
coat then just one coat of my new
favorite regular black creme polish
y'all are interested the link is below
then so I'm told you can't you
a regular glass and taco you have to use
a water-based taco okay let me speak
English for a second apparently a
regular top coat will destroy the
chromatic pigment but a water-based
topcoat is gentle enough to just add
what's like a sticky layer on top of
your nail so I let that dry for about
five minutes and now with time to test
it again are we gonna see the magic I
want to see the magic and holy as
you can see it's obviously working I
think a lot of this is about technique
as well you need to push it down firmly
enough that it's like really getting in
there and sticking but not too hard or
else you end up scraping it off but
being me I obviously struggled with just
the middle finger just the fingernail
that's supposed to be the star of all my
tutorials no matter how much extra
pigment I added or how much I push down
hard into my nail it was just some black
spots that the green chrome refused to
stick to and obviously it worked
perfectly fine on all of my other nails
can we just - just look at that for a
second look at how beautiful that is
determined to make the chrome shine as
effortlessly as my other nails seem to
do I took it all off and redid it a
second time it still didn't work so I
redid it a third time and still what the
hell man this nail is cursed why can't
you be like this nail or this new
doesn't make any sense so I thought
maybe I'll add another water-based taco
on top of that and try and shove the
pigment into this layer and yet it kind
of worked but it didn't really work and
then I did it a fourth time and right
now you're thinking holy Christine
you're so committed to your experiments
and yeah we got the patchiness again and
honestly I wasn't frustrated as you are
watching this but what I like to do on
my channel when I'm not doing really
dumb that makes your brain rot is I
like to show you all my mistakes and the
ways in which I up partly because
well I'm also a human and I'd like you
to think I'm a human but mostly because
my mistakes are valuable to you and you
will learn what not to do
except in this very rare case I don't
know what I did wrong so I can't tell
you what not to do Paul in experiment
without a conclusion the worst kind at
this point it was like way past my
bedtime so I just peeled off simply peel
like no big deal so I could go to bed
faster and yeah obviously I gave up on
this meal damn son overall that looks
really freaking cool
you're supposed to top coat it with a
water-based topcoat but what the hell
kind of science is happening on my nail
now there's so many things in this video
I just can't explain so I feel like a
failure to you any scientists out there
please leave some comments below and for
me what the hell is going on it didn't
really do that weird separation thing on
my middle nail though I'm gonna guess
that's because there's like three layers
of this topcoat already on this nail but
finally we're done and it's with regular
polish which makes me even more proud
even though there may be imperfections
is it not perfect yeah maybe
is it colorful yes is it reflective hell
yes
does it look awesome you know it bitch
yeah it was a bit of a struggle for me
to get to this point but I definitely
think it's something you can get better
at with practice practice makes perfect
they say and they're always annoying
when they say that overall I think this
looks really cool and I haven't really
seen people using these multi chrome
powders yet but oh you thought I was
gonna leave this video without putting
holo on something you thought wrong
actually on a silver nail I just decided
to add a little hollow taco and you can
see right away that any topcoat is going
to make the reflective chrome pigments
crinkle so this answers your question
about what it would look like with a
regular top coat I mean it does look
kind of cool like that crinkled and
Hollow
but it won't have the same flat mirror
effect they also want to let you guys
know that after I wore this for a day
and had a shower this happened well
now what's interesting is that it's most
cracked on the same nails that the
water-based topcoat was applying the
worst I think what happened here is that
when the nails weren't sealed properly
with the water-based topcoat water from
the shower got under the topcoat and
started messing up the chrome pigments
I'm not really sure what the solution is
if it's anything like nail foils and
adding a regular quick dry top coat on
top of everything might protect the
chrome stuff better but it would also
ruin it by eating it and turning it into
grainy foil my thumb seems to have
turned out the best weird give this
video a thumbs up for that I guess this
is one of the main reasons why these
chrome pigments are meant to be used
with gel polish and not regular polish
but being me I had to be a rebel let me
know down in the comments if you guys
have any suggestions about how to make
this better work with regular polish and
let me just anticipate your next
question about hollow powder and the
answer is yes I have it and I'm gonna
try it soon keep your little hollow
horseys patient and thanks so much for
watching this video and I'll see y'all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
