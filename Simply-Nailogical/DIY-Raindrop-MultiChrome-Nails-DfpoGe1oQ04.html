cry
look look at that multi chroma shift I'm
shook haha damn I just published my
greatest hallo Hits Vol - why couldn't
I've waited for this gem
well hallo everyone it's me christine
again and no that's not actually water
on my nails but it could be I've seen
this technique around for a long time on
Instagram think we call it the water
droplet technique not sure raindrops
shiny blobs sure but let me guess you
may not even be here for this nail art
tutorial you might just be watching this
video to find out the winners of my two
million YouTube subscribers giveaway
not to worry those are gonna be
announced at the end of the video so
first you can watch me do my actual
nails I know holy shit this never
happens so I'm starting off with the
peel off base coat because I'm gonna
peel it off and add it to my bag now I'm
applying one thin coat of black gel
polish and if you're asking if you have
to use gel no you don't you can use
regular polish but I'll show you why I
didn't commit this black gel polish
though is not opaque at all lack milk so
with gel polish you got to put it under
a fancy purple alien light thing and
then that cures it as they call it
basically means it makes it hard and you
have to do that for every coat so I've
cured one coat of black gel polish and
now I'm applying a second coat to make
it actually opaque baking and caring and
baking and Keurig now I'm applying a
glossy gel topcoat because the magical
chameleon multi chrome powders work best
over gel topcoat we gonna cure it again
to avoid some of the mess from the
powder which is one thing I absolutely
hated about doing this the last time
around it gets all up in your cuticles
I'm using one of these purely apron
thingies last time in working with these
powders I found that putting liquid
latex around my nail actually kind of
ruined the shiny effect of the powder so
not doing that this time so there's a
few different ways to do this you could
use your finger one of the fancy
applicators or an eyeshadow applicator
like this today I'm going with a basic
bitch approach then you just rub it on
that's about it what's funny though is
that I still use eyeshadow applicators
that look exactly like this on my eyes I
know you're not supposed to do that
you're supposed to use blending brushes
but those don't work for me okay I'm
still working on my simply faced logical
when you're done and the magic is on
your nail you can peel up the apron dust
some dust ease away now we're gonna add
another glossy gel taco to seal the
powders in this will make sure that
there's no water damage that gets into
the powders which then basically blew
them up so you need this step and then
you cure the taco one last time and
everything's fine but before we move on
to the raindrop step I want to show you
guys my attempt of doing this with
regular black polish underneath not gel
so that was my favorite one coat or
regular black polish and I put a gel
topcoat over top a regular glossy top
coat won't work with the powders but a
water-based topcoat would work as I
showed you in my hollow powder nails
video I do find that these nail powders
are stronger or shinier if you will over
top of a gel topcoat as opposed to any
kind of regular polish so that's what
I'm doing and one important thing that I
fail to mention because I'm not a nail
tech why are you even listening to me
for tips is that the gel taco you use
has to be a non wipe gel which basically
means you don't wipe some alcohol shit
on it to remove the sticky layer this
mysterious sticky layer yeah the no wipe
gel topcoat there is no sticky layer so
you can go ahead and apply the powder
right away after curing they sell all
this shit on Amazon I put some example
links down below in the video
description box and now for the reason
why I realized it may not be the
smartest idea to use regular polish
underneath it all is that you get these
little rippling effects and based on
some preliminary research I think this
is the result of the black polish not
fully drawing because regular polish
does not solidify instantly with the
curing machine-like gel polish does so
gel polish and regular nail polish are
really not
compatible really shouldn't be used
together I mean I'm not an ell tech but
I read that on some nail tech blog so
they're probably right anyways if you
want to avoid any potential weird shit
forming under your nail under the layers
like what's happening to mine I
recommend using all gel polish but look
at the shift' do you forget about the
deformities look at this shit
whoo boy girl oh by the way this magical
powder is available internationally now
before was really hard to find and now
it's really easy to find I made it super
easy for you by giving you a direct link
below you're welcome oh no did we forget
what's on my other hands oh shit my
nails are so much shorter if you follow
me on snapchat you would have seen the
trauma actually wasn't that traumatic
it's fine cuz it's the hand I don't give
a shit about isn't this teal Hollow
flaky polish nice though yeah okay back
to the all gel based nails to do the
raindrop effect I wanted to make the
background a little match so I would
have a contrast between the shiny
raindrops and the background so I'm just
applying a matte topcoat on top of the
multi chrome oh it's not shouting
anymore I'm so sad now I'm taking some
gel topcoat I put it on my nail art mat
and I'm just taking a tiny brush and
painting dots on it pretty and simple I
said it was easy I didn't lie you could
just use a dotting tool if you want but
I kind of wanted to play with the
different shapes and sizes and I was too
lazy to go get my dotting tool hey
that's the actual truth what's cool
about doing this technique over a multi
chrome base specifically is that the
bubbles of water like spheres reflect
the multi chrome at all different angles
so it really helps bring out the fact
that it shifts colors you're not seeing
that right now from this angle because
this angle is full-on light in my studio
that's not a studio it's just my condo
looks like a sassy reptile now we're
just gonna cure it so we can make the
balls hard but and now let's get some
shifting porn in it Oh a whole new type
of nail porn shift porn I think this
technique is pretty dope if you ask me
and it doesn't have to be raindrops or
little circles you could paint on
whatever you like it does
make your nails a little 3d which is not
only cool when people ask if they can
touch your nails like a creep but also
because it reflects the Rainbows of the
multi Chrome under it and so many
amazing different ways
lighting is key for multi chrome nail so
if you do this look make sure you raise
your nails up to the light and then down
low and then up and down and and
basically just just do a dance oh you
