again do you ever watch any of my nail
art videos and get overwhelmed at how
much time it would take to actually do
them yourself yes same sometimes you
want your nails just lay and you don't
want it to take all day you know what
I'm saying
you just want a quickie no quick and
dirty you want to get in and out your
cheap ass don't want to pay no bitch to
do it you want to do it yourself so how
about we do that together right now but
first a quick life update from your
friendly neighborhood Canadian I went to
America again recently specifically Los
Angeles I met a lot of fantastic people
went to some fabulous places and was
doing fancy things all over town if
you'd like to know more you can watch my
vlog on my second channel simply not
logical it's where I post random shit
also if you care at all about my life
you could follow me on my other social
medias that's where I tend to update
people on things I do and don't do and
now for the quickie since these were the
nails I wore to LA I used a shitty peel
off base coat so they wouldn't fall off
on the red carpet because that would be
embarrassing you'll see why it's a
shitty base coat when I trigger you with
some terrible peel born at the end of
this video stay tuned
first I'm starting out with one coat of
this ridiculously opaque bright pink
linear holo it is fabulous I put the
link down below I recently did a
sponsored video with his collection and
I'm dying I'm dying it's so good I don't
even like pink okay but I like this next
we're gonna seal her in with a nice
thick glossy taco don't let Donald Trump
grabbed you by the taco people ask me
all the time which glossy taco do you
use and I use one that's often sold out
because you guys are Savage but I did
put the link below so if it happens to
be in stock when you check it and you
want it you should get it before it's
gone it's my favorite glossy taco
because it dries super quick and I love
using it with nail vinyls next and
that's what we're doing right now okay
the simplest thing to slay all day I'm
using a deep V nail vinyl I put the link
for that down below I know what's on my
other
and it's exactly the same phone thing
holy shit you're a longtime subscriber
on this channel you know this never
happened
history has been made then you're just
going to smooth down that nail vinyl so
you can get some nice clean edges with
the nail polish and now I'm painting
around the sides with my favorite black
polish in my last video I had a
competition of twelve different black
polishes and this one was the winner
really important to have a super opaque
black if you want to do things like this
so all you need is one coat to peel off
that now vinyl well the black polish is
still wet do some cleanup before it
dries you don't want it getting out
crusty that's gonna ruin your life now I
know these nails are already sliding but
we're gonna make them slay even more by
adding some black hollow which
holographic glitter this is the best
most badass black hollow glitter in a
nail polish form I've ever seen maybe
I'm biased because it's part of one of
my collaboration collections or maybe
it's just fucking badass did you think
that I kind of wanted it to be a little
bit of a scattered glittery effect so
that's why I'm just painting it on
carefully with the brush and not
sponging it on like I might usually do
and then that's really it quite simple
it's just a pink hollow dagger in a
black hollow world it's ready to stab
your heart out like a motherfucker
makeup artists lay with their winged
aligner and we slay with our hollow
nails bitch finish off with a nice thick
coat of glossy tack at home that's top
coat in case you still don't understand
what everything and you're done this
design is easy enough to do on both
hands trust me because I did it on both
hands and I normally never do nail art
on my other hand and it's one of those
looks that can slay from up close or
from really far away because when you
blur the hollow magical should happen
this is me trying to pose with both my
hands one of my hands is really good at
this because it does this all the time
the other one not so much
you're fired it's okay we can't all be
hand models but no matter how terrible
you are at hand posing you know you go
all slay all day with hollow nails all
right and that's that for a quick and
dirty slay slay bitch slay nail art
tutorial comment down below how you slay
it life I I would like to know thanks so
much for watching and i'll slay y'all
later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
