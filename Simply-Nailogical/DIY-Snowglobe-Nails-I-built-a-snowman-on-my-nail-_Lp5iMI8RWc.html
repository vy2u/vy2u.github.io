come on let's do our nails
I rarely upload nail art anymore it's
such a chore I should change my channel
I used to do tutorials and now I don't I
wish I could tell you why do you want to
do some nail art I don't want to do just
nail art okay
simply holiday Hits Vol one coming soon
well hallo everyone it's me christine
again and today we have something even
more ambitious than an L our tutorial on
this channel it's more like a nail
building tutorial because I built a
goddamn snow globe on my nail in the
past year so I've seen so many of you
guys request that I try out snow globe
nails or aquarium nails which are very
similar in concept let me show you
so I've seen snow globe nails around for
maybe a couple years now and it's
basically just a fixing a hollow ball
hollow for not the right type of hollow
and you put it on your nail and fill it
with some glitter and liquid and you
shake it around and it looks like a snow
globe and then aquarium nails is pretty
much the same thing but it's a flatter
shell as opposed to a more circular
round ball oh my god is that polish
Mountain what the fuck they only really
work if you have naturally very short
nails and then you build on a fake nail
because you need to fake nails that are
both clear so when you put them together
you can see the aquarium stuff swimming
around inside the nail so yeah for that
reason aquarium nails won't really work
on me because I have naturally long
nails that are not see-through but I can
do snowglobe nails which kind of look
like a clear version of bubble nails or
like clear polish Mountain anyone
remember those videos hey oh God as you
guys may know I am NOT an actual nail
technician and I have very little to no
knowledge about professional nail
building shit so I took to YouTube to
find out how the fuck to build a snow
globe I mostly relied on this tutorial
by Absolut nails and what she did is use
the tip of an applicator dropper bottle
as the mold to create the top of the
snow globe she put some saran wrap over
it and then dipped it in some builders
gel which again fancy shit I don't know
anything about and dun-da-da-dun she
made a snow globe do we think I can do
this challenge accepted I've got a
dropper applicator thing from all my
nail oil adventures it does look like it
would be the perfect size next
take some saran wrap and cover up the
head Dexter style bitch you gonna die it
wasn't really staying put so I took an
elastic and secured it around the head
for murder
would now absolute nails used building
gel but I don't know what that is and
I'm kind of scared to use it so we're
just gonna use a plain old glossy gel
taco because I understand it so I
slapped on one coat of that and baked
that shit for a minute and ooh do you
notice what's on my main hands I'm still
wearing my simply custom men's dress
shoes powder mix from my last video now
I assume that building gel is a lot
thicker than just a glossy gel taco so
we're gonna do two coats to be sure time
to unwrap my Christmas present Wow it
kind of looks like a jellyfish whoa so I
had a little bit of trouble trying to
pull the plastic wrap from the snow
globe but I eventually very carefully
separated them and look it's the perfect
size for my thumb since I have very
narrow nails I'm gonna use my thumb to
build the snow globe on because two
youtubers all that matters is the
thumbnail and now we got a build a
snowman I'm gonna make it out of jail
so I tried to build a snowman out of gel
topcoat and maybe my snowman looks a
little melty or deranged but he's my
snowman and he is special to me so then
of course we got to paint him white and
since I don't have white gel polish and
this is regular polish we're just gonna
cover him with some silver hollow
glitter gel polish because then that way
we can cure him of winter I wish I could
cure Canada of winter that would be nice
snowman's gonna need some eyes so he can
see all the hollow and a carrot as a
nose that is lopsided it's okay it gives
him character look at that my little
snowman pet and now it's time for some
thumbnail
I don't think you've ever seen Mac
they'll take it off before I'm applying
a peel-off base coat because my plan is
to be able to peel off my whole nail
later and maybe save my snow globe nail
for my pee wee bag but you'll have to
stay tuned to see if that works then
we're going to apply just a nice hollow
blue as the base and let's do a gradient
for old times sake I'm just putting some
liquid latex around my nail to protect
my skin from the mess and let's make a
blue to silver holo gradient because
it's very winter wonderland and also
hallow witches of the utmost importance
so in about a minute or two after the
liquid latex dries you can take your
makeup sponge and dab dab dab the
gradient right on the nail because you
got a dab dab dab to make your nails
look fab then we gonna peel it off haha
you two please don't you monetize me
thank you oh my God look at that blend
I'm amazed I remember how to do this and
let's add a hollow flake taco so it
looks like sparkling snow in the night
now I'm adding a glossy gel taco so I
can seal that all in and harden it up
before we attach our snow globe men and
then we just stick our little snowman
down on some wet glossy gel taco look at
him he is so cute and we're just gonna
add some more gel top coat around his
ass so he does not go anywhere let me go
fake that shit for a minute
again the snow globe had a lot of rough
edges from taking it off for the plastic
wrap so I trimmed those down and now the
most important part the crucial part to
making this actually look good is
cutting out a small opening towards the
base of the globe on one side only
because we're gonna use that to inject
the liquid into so you want to have that
opening face upwards because gravity and
now we're gonna stick the snow globe
down onto the nail by applying a glassy
gel taco all around the edges everywhere
except that small little opening this is
very tedious work I apologize if the
camera angles were not ideal now we're
gonna bake him for a minute
Oh mr. snowman is gonna be so baked
after this he gonna melt to make sure my
snow globe was super secure I took some
more glossy gel taco with a small
dotting tool just ran a bead all around
the base of the snow globe to get it to
stick to the nail and always baking in
between
and now it's time to start loading up
the snowman's helm with lots of glitter
first we're gonna add some iridescent
glitters because they look like snow
don't worry we'll get to hollow next and
I just kind of shove them into mr.
snowman's home and now what do we really
want snow to look like obviously it's
hollow so I took some loose hollow
flakes and shoved those in the dome as
well because I think these would make
one of the most beautiful snow storms
humanity has ever witnessed and now for
the liquid part so it seems like whether
it's snow globe or aquarium nails people
are using baby oil as the liquid so I
stole some oil from a baby and then used
an eyedropper to inject it into the
little opening it was absolutely leaking
everywhere but I was just crossing my
fingers that the oil was just flowing
everywhere because my applicator was not
small enough to go directly into the
opening and so it was just overflowing
from the sides but we will see okay we
will see the true test is coming final
step is to seal up the little opening
with some more glassy gel chaco and then
bake that shit for a minute and everyone
hold your breath is my nail gonna pop is
it all gonna spill everywhere
well the snowman have no home oh my god
it worked I am really impressed with
myself okay I did not think I would be
able to do this because I'm literally
just using gel top coat which isn't
really that strong on its own if I poked
this bubble it would probably just crack
I noticed when I tried to shake my thumb
around the liquids and all the glitters
inside don't actually spiral around the
globe like you see in a real snow globe
so that's kind of disappointing but
maybe the globe is just too small for it
to have that effect
I don't know physics or something I'm
just proud that I was able to actually
seal all this in when I filmed this
tutorial it had just started snowing
here in Ottawa Canada and look how nice
my mr. snowman globe looks in the night
and now let's see if I can peel this off
and keep it as its own pili without
bursting the globe
oh my god no I stabbed it no I'm sorry
mr. snowman you are going to die now so
I guess the base of the nail just wasn't
solid enough or I poked it by accident
oops can we have a cleanup in Aisle
three please well even though mr.
snowman's globe environment has been
completely destroyed I'm still gonna
keep him in my pili bag I hope you guys
enjoyed watching me tackle the snow
globe nail I honestly thought I would
fuck up approximately 18 times trying to
do this so I'm kind of proud but mostly
surprised that I was able to make this
snow globe in one shot without any leaks
until I tried to take it off now are you
gonna build a snowman
let me know in the comments below
alright guys hope you're having a happy
holidays and thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
