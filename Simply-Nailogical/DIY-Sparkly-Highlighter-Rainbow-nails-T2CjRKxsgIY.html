today I've got the brightest sparkly of
coolest nail design done with
highlighters because why use nail polish
on your nails when you can use school
supplies but look don't they look so
juicy like candy and so delicious I
licked them and I didn't taste good so
don't try that now before I actually put
the stuff on my nails I did a few
experiments and I'd like to show you
those experiments because we believe in
science on this channel if you don't
care about my experiments then you can
skip ahead to this time code but you
should want to watch them because it's
basically like your science class in
school but way more fun so we'll leave
it up to you watch all my video or do
your science homework so what you've
been seeing is the brand new simply neat
miracle mat and it's what I'm going to
use to perform my experiments on those
of you who saw my other video on a
similar mat yes the uber mat is exactly
the same as the simply neat mat when it
comes to the silicon material bundle
monster also has one too
I'd say that the only real difference
between them is that this mat has these
raised circle things it becomes like a
little swimming pool for acetone or
acrylic paint or glitter and all sorts
of things so they don't go all over the
place for this tutorial I won't need
this part of the mat but it may be
something useful for you so if you want
to mat like this honestly any of these
three will do I put the links for all
three down below and you can check them
out and decide what's best for you now
look at us sparkly silver hollow an
effort to make the highlighter Sparkle I
wanted to paint them over top of a
hollow glitter but first which hollow
glitter do
yes and I think it's pretty obvious that
the one on the left is way more
jam-packed with silver hollow glitters
even though I'm trying to pump up the
brush on the one on the right it's just
not quite as satisfying I put the link
down below to my favorite and now I'm
applying a peel-off base coat because
anytime you wear glitter you're gonna
want to peel it off first because it's
annoying to take off otherwise and
second because it's really satisfying to
peel it off speaking of satisfying
peeling things I'm applying some simply
peel around my nails so I can easily
sponge on the hollow glitter and not
have to worry about making a mess all
over my finger why am i sponging on the
glitter because that's the best way to
put glitter polish on your nail and get
maximum glitter coverage the makeup
sponge acts as a sponge go figure to
absorb the jelly in the Polish leaving
more glitters behind ooh so much spongy
goodness and then I simply filled it off
like no big deal oh yeah back to
experiments we should probably actually
start those I'm using the less
concentrated silver hollow glitter for
my experiment because I don't want to
waste my favorite one and I'm just
filling in a bunch of boxes on the mat
with the silver hollow glitter cuz we're
gonna do a bunch of different
experiments with the highlighters on one
of the boxes I added a quick dry top
coat because I'm curious to know if the
highlighters actually go better over top
coat than just the glitter let's label
this so I don't forget I am drawing
upside down now check out my shitload of
highlighters who knew there were so many
kinds let's just call this regular
highlighters liquid highlighters and gel
highlighters weird let's start off with
regular highlighters because I know
you've all seen these before
you know highlighting your textbook that
you don't actually read they're applying
okay but I think I'm getting a little
bit of pooling
I'm looking for as in its not really
infiltrating all through the hollow
glitters it's kind of like sticking in
some sections but the colors are
blending together quite nicely and all
up now it's like a sparkly rainbow
gradient I love it let's mark it with an
R for regular and now let's try liquid
highlighters liquid highlighters were
always my favorite kind of highlighter
in school because they are so much more
satisfying with their juicy inky flow
look at all those juicy colors can
someone please also confirm that this is
their favorite kind of highlighter for
the same reason so I don't feel like
such a crazy person either way look at
how awesome this result is yeah these
highlighters are clearly way more
saturated in color they're brighter and
more vivid and they blend together
better than the regular highlighters you
you are so basic I label it L for liquid
and I don't even know if highlighter
comes off this matte I hope it does and
on to the last highlighter gel
highlighter it kind of looks like a
thawing popsicle or maybe a shaved
carrot
okay this color is weirder than a
highlighter should color it reminds me
of a wax crown crayon I know I say
crayon like crown whatever blame it on
the Canada well this looks like
either that or a delicious snow cone
that I kind of want to lick this
highlighter doesn't even draw properly I
wrote a G I swear there's a G there look
see I told you you to actually learn
something useful for school don't get
gel eyeliners all right now let's take
our favorite highlighter type the liquid
one and try it over taco because an
experiment isn't finished until you've
covered all the possibilities and I'm
getting a weird cooling effect
presumably because the topcoat acts as a
resistant barrier let's try the gel one
again just for shits and giggles it's
still ugly okay both of these
experiments failed let's go back to our
winner so now I'm taking the winning
highlighter set and colored by color I'm
gonna draw on a rainbow it's really that
simple when you put on the next color if
you overlap it a little bit on the
is color they get a bit of a blending
effect so it's like a real gradient to a
girl that pink is so pretty and look at
that purple blend it's magic and then we
do the orange and then the yellow don't
forget the tip I decided I want the
colors to be a little bit brighter so I
just went over some of the colors a
second time just make sure when you're
doing this that you apply light pressure
with your highlighter tip and don't like
stab it into your nail I did that on my
other finger and this is what happened
when you're satisfied with your colors
add a glossy top coat and now everyone
at school gon be jelly of you wow so
beautiful and Hollow and rainbow and
sparkly and how the things that are good
in this world and how easy was that and
took like zero time to do it on my nails
once we got past all the experiments in
fact it's so easy and take so little
time that you could probably do this in
class
just thought I'd plant that idea in your
head don't tell your mother that part oh
yeah I should probably clean up this mat
so it's really easy to clean these mats
you just peel up the dried polish oh no
we forgot to look at what was on my
other hand today how could you forget
Christine I can't for the life of me
find who suggested this but one of you
on YouTube said I should do a what's on
my other hand thing and today it's this
gorgeous black hollow it's got hollow
glitter in a black hollow base with
gorgeous flakes throughout and you can
see all the colors of the rainbow I put
the link down below for this polish and
that's it for today's what's on my other
hand as it seems a lot of you are
curious to know stop procrastinating
start cleaning I just took a cotton pad
soaked in acetone and rubbed it all
around the mat and it took off the
highlighter no problem thank God that
would be pissed if I ruined this scrub a
little harder to get the glitters off
and bam your mattress clean and you can
start all over just when you thought I
couldn't make this video any longer I'm
gonna make it even longer with some peel
porn cuz its
just oh so satisfying to see me peel it
off you my favorite peel off base coat I
love you all right thanks so much for
watching and see y'all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
