again and holy my nails are alive
it's been almost three full months since
I posted my last real nail art video and
wow this guy's going to be so excited
when he gets to watch all my new nail
art videos when he wakes up in the past
three months I've posted 20 videos on my
main channel there were pretty much
anything but nail art as you may recall
my last nail art tutorial before the
tragic death in my family the broken
betrayal
we shall not speak of for it is too
painful with a unicorn nail art so it's
only fitting that I mark my three months
later returned to nail art with unicorn
inspired nail but unicorn inspired as
for Starbucks standards which basically
looks like cotton candy mush and tastes
like birthday cake and sour fruit and it
doesn't have hollow but here we are
you've seen all those Starbucks unicorn
drink videos popping up on YouTube
Starbucks and getting a lot of free
promo huh I mean not that you guys do
that every single day on my snapchat but
whatever so I'm going to give Starbucks
some free promo now after the drink is
done and sold out haha a quick mail
checkup three months ago this
happened to me and broke my soul five
weeks ago they'd grown out just enough
so that I didn't have a crash down the
center of them and now today they look
like this
yay but all thanks to time nails grow
it's amazing
yes I am working on how to grow your
nails video but I need more time to let
them grow out fully middle nail is still
slightly curved on one of the sides so
it's not quite as square as I usually
like to file my nails but oh my god
what's that on my other hand it's a
beautiful light blue hollow with
holographic flakies in it my god it's so
pretty it could be in a Starbucks drink
alright let's get into it shall we
I'm starting off with not a peel-off
base coat where is Christine and what
did you do with her because I figure I
might like these so I'm going to want to
keep them on for a while and oops I
already forgot how to paint my nails add
a white creme polish base coat to help
make the colors pop now cover all the
white in pink yeah
then I thought well maybe this pink is a
little too dark for the drink so I took
this lighter pink which is not opaque at
all and just did one thin coat over top
there sure I'm adding some liquid latex
around my nail so that the next part
isn't so much a it's almost like the
color green of the Starbucks trough
totally did that on purpose let the
liquid latex dry a couple of minutes and
now we're going to get our magical
colors using some purple first we're
going to put a bit on a yogurt lid or a
nail art mat or your parents table up to
you take a big Ishmael art brush dip it
in some acetone preferably 100% acetone
and then you're going to dilute the nail
polish with the acetone essentially
turning it into a watercolor nail polish
I've done this technique before with my
rainbow smoked nail art and I thought it
worked out pretty cool so I'm going to
try that again then just lightly dab it
on just trying to create a messy cloudy
look really now let's go back in with
the pink add some acetone and this just
helps blend the edges of the purple and
the pink bit better I don't even know
what the fall goes in the drink to make
it purple and pink sometimes they're
just purple and sometimes they're mostly
pink who really knows now we're going to
try and replicate the dripping blue
syrup I'm taking a smaller brush dipping
that in acetone and diluting this cyan
blue color and it just hit me that this
is basically a cotton candy stone marble
look if you were Melanie Martinez this
is what you request for your kitchen
counters you can kind of soften up the
lines of the blue by going back in with
a bit more acetone and letting it cool
around the line and this technique is
great you know if you're a freehand
painter like myself because it's all
about abstract and make a mistake and
just cover it up or pretend it's part of
the artwork sure there see beautiful
kitchen counter oh spend so long I
forgot you can't stick your fingers
together with liquid latex and now we
got to put the whipped cream on top
because what's a starbucks Frappuccino
without it so I'm taking some white
polish diluting it with acetone and then
ripping up a piece of the makeup sponge
and dabbing that and the diluted white
to then dab on the tip of my nail so
it's kind of like a French tip but
whipped cream ewwww
and now you're gonna peel your lac no
big deal
oh this is what happens when you
waited too long so the nail polish kind
of dried up a bit that's okay we just
gotta flake it off
maybe this now will be better peel porn
for you yes whoo let's try that again
I've had better so to get up the little
flaky bits you can just gently very
gently scrape around the cuticle and now
we're going to seal it all off by adding
a nice thick coat of glossy chaco oh
yeah don't forget to wrap the tip and
then scrape off all the excess around
the nail because Christine forgot how to
paint her nail and there we have it a
Starbucks unicorn Frappuccino on my nail
isn't it appetizing don't you want to
lick them I don't answer that you know
what this unicorn drink is missing those
unicorn skin oh would you look at that
there's unicorn skin right behind me
don't worry it was a hundred percent
ethically harvested yo what if Starbucks
had gotten limited-edition cups lined
with unicorn skin missed opportunity
missed opportunity so naturally I had to
go get the drink so I could pose with it
and by I I mean been oh thank you
the spills of blue weren't quite as
perfect as they are in the pictures in
fact there wasn't really that much blue
at all but it's good enough it'll have
to do so I know the Starbucks unicorn
frappe drink is now over but I'm totally
going to go into Starbucks with these
nails and show them to her versa and be
like you like my nails if you miss
making these drinks now I love the
unicorn theme and the colors but if
there's one thing missing we all know
what it is it's time to add a hollow
taco I mean how can you have unicorns
without any Hollow there that looks so
much better I see I feel better you know
I feel at peace now
Starbucks you shoulda thought of this
first because look how beautiful that is
this is how a true hollow sexual takes
their coffee
all right guys hope you enjoyed this
actual nail art tutorial I'm still going
to be doing a lot of fun stupid videos
