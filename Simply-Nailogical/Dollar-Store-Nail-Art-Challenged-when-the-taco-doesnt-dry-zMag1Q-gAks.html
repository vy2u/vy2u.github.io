hello everyone it's me christine again
I've seen so many comments from you guys
asking me to do dollar store nail art
and I thought to myself that sounds like
a really fun challenge to do now let me
just be clear this isn't a video where I
challenge myself to shop at the dollar
store mother this morning I am NOT above
shopping at the dollar store in fact I
love the dollar store what do you think
I buy all my cat poop bags okay I get
all my follower aking paper there that's
how I wrap all my Christmas presents and
just like wrap things in life to make
them prettier but I will say that the
dollar store probably doesn't curate the
best quality products for nail art so my
expectations are low but I'm up for the
challenge y'all and so yesterday I went
to the Dollar Tree to begin my nail art
shopping spree
while I was in there I noticed that
items were in fact not $1 everything was
a dollar 25 could be inflation or it
could just be the currency conversion
from u.s. to Canadian dollars right off
the bat I was particularly happy to find
a lot of affordable hollow items Hollow
unicorn skin and cartons can hollow
unicorns and after getting momentarily
distracted by the hollow I went straight
to the beauty aisle one day will be
beautiful person they had some fake
nails some nail care sort of and lots of
nail polishes most of the nail polishes
were creme finished and they were
generally in the pink to reddish orange
hue range with very little exciting
colors and sadly there was no holo I
mean I guess that makes sense holo is
not cheap now I wasn't really familiar
with the brands of nail polish I found
at the dollar store and I was somewhat
surprised I didn't find any knockoff OPI
or Essie polishes because that's
something I've definitely seen before in
the dollar store
there were many interesting nail
products for grating cheese or your feet
why does this a brightening eye color
and then there's a picture of nails what
is this how does I feel them perfect I
was looking for that that nail well I'm
gonna need a base coat do they have a
peel off nope I found a taco and it's
purple why my god it's a pedicure set
hey man can I give you another spa day
if any beauty gurus are looking for a
quick tip I got 20 of them for you in
this pack I don't want to do this don't
make me do this no I don't wanna know
hey look there's an elf on the shelf
is there a Mensch on a bench super dry
like my sense of humor
Kathlyn yeah now unforgettable if
someone else hates on the length of my
hair I will block you sassy and cheap
just like me if you can be my squeeze to
my baby's toy so I wouldn't trust that
the new rapper in town it's tattoo boy
okay move
I wasn't really finding many nail art
supplies a couple stickers and bows but
there weren't any brushes or nail vinyls
or other types of things I could
actually do nail art with I thought I'd
tried the arts and crafts aisle wow
that's so ecstatically pleasing yet an
artist's dream I know you're wondering
what I'm wondering would you be my
friend forever and then I got distracted
again
why aren't you subscribed look at all
the trolls it's like the comments
section what why weren't these around
when I was 7 and wanted to play with
fires I'm a holographic horn I'm gonna
ask the mechanic if he can't install
this in the car you're not allowed on
YouTube anymore oh my god that our CEO
Beauty jacksFilms is here everybody
could I get one axe to go please thank
you I get a hundred dollars for a dollar
25 this video was sponsored to you by
play money play money I'm surprised that
the staff didn't kick me out first story
I actually did try and do the same sort
of dollar store nail polish video many
years ago when I was first starting to
put my face in my videos you guys are in
the dollar store now I should probably
clean up this mess
should I clean up this house and I did
get kicked out just as I was observing
counterfeit a/c polishes they're not
real because they don't have a sticker
at the top that says the name or color
or on the bottom it is you can't see
here and then the video just never made
it to the internet anyways back to
yesterday's trip it was time to cash out
and here we are sixty two dollars and
fifteen cents later and I got forty four
items that's a pretty good damn deal I'm
gonna think of it do we even need dollar
stores anymore when you can just shop
online at the virtual dollar store we
call wish okay so I didn't mean to
include this in my purchase this is not
for nails this is just for me to roll up
my change and bring it to the bank
all right that's speaking first let's
get some good vibes going with the
raspberries get a scented candle smells
not good enough to eat I guess I gotta
take my nail art off no this is one of
your guys's nail arts that I recreated
and I've had it on for over two weeks
now I don't want to take it off but I
guess it kind of works out that I hadn't
used a peel off base coat when I did
these because now we can test out the
dollar store nail polish remover DeLong
salon formula flammable keep away from
heat and flame okay made in Canada
really got some cotton pads too also
made in Canada what our there margin so
good I'm confused
alright we're gonna need some cuticle
oil to help protect the skin while using
nail polish remover however is this mate
Vancouver British Columbia Canada I'm
kind of shocked that that's now three
out of three items are made in Canada I
was mostly expecting all of this to be
made in China and I mean that just for
economical reasons because is just
much cheaper to mass-produce over there
and then you can actually list it for a
dollar twenty five and still make money
oh my god this cuticle oil is awful it's
like it doesn't soak in it just travels
along your skin like a bead of water on
a water resistant surface now you're
gonna have to witness what's on my other
hand these are not my nails actually
you're looking at someone else's nails I
can't possibly be mine someone else
anyways I'm bored let's open this
whatsoever party perfect I can use this
to summon Ben man wanna have a tea party
there's only a dollar sixty-nine okay so
I was just in the middle of digging on
me oh my god alright well now that I'm
naked all the dollar store had to file
nails was emery board nail files you
guys have seen any of my nail care
videos you know that I wouldn't touch
these with a ten-foot now because they
are basically really coarse sandpaper
doing this to myself what why I can't
look oh no but I need to look oh my god
what I knew it I knew it I regret
everything the dollar store broke my
nail what the what the dollar
store
how do I sue you okay let me think this
through this probably happened he's not
just because of these shittiest files
but also because I wasn't using a good
cuticle oil that helps to hydrate my
nail as I was filing it so I was filing
really dry nails which is not good and
they were extra dry because I had just
used
polish remover which on its own may not
be so terrible but without the
combination of that and a good hydrating
nail oil you end up with it now I broke
in the corner and I don't know how to go
on with my life
but that's okay we're gonna proceed
anyways because life still isn't so bad
first I'm just gonna apply a primer base
I believe it's for your nails and while
we're waiting for this base coat to dry
why don't we paint my other hand how
about this neon yellow that just looks
like liquid highlighter marker I think
some of you guys have noticed that my
nails have been a little bit shorter
these days especially on this hand
that's because I moved I moved half my
life so far so I'm sleeping and eating
somewhere else but I'm filming and
painting my nails here I'm gonna move
this half of my life soon so you should
start seeing videos in my new space
shortly anyways it's hard to move and
you know help with that kind of
when your nails are so long and you're
like I'm sorry I can't do anything now
we're gonna add a glossy taco ooh my
favorite part this feels like a very
thin glossy type y'all know I like my
glass the tacos nice and thick all the
new people to my channel are wondering
how I got so many subscribers see how
she dries alright I gotta think for a
second what kind of nail art can I do
with the spread we got here from the
dollar store I seem to have a lot of
pink and green nail polishes not many
tools to use for nail art although I did
get some brushes hmm oh I know I'm
thinking watermelon nails
let's no I already nicked myself
goddamnit you were supposed to drive oh
my god this is awful you see that look
at that I just fingerprinted myself on
this let's start off with some
white nail polish as the base she better
not be too milky oh actually that's not
bad
holy
who made you billy illy cosmetics french
manicure now oh that's why every time
you buy why are those white nail
polishes that says it's specifically for
the French chip manicure it's always way
thicker so there you go there's a nail
hack for you that's actually useful
first we're gonna paint on some
watermelon pink watermelon serve large
and we're gonna paint the whole nail but
leave a gap near the cuticle where we're
gonna fill it in with some green for the
watermelon rind
we got three options of greens I'm gonna
go with this one lime sizzle gel gel gel
polish Billy gel effect gel effect oh ho
I see you can't fool me Billy let's try
using a paintbrush oh my god these
brushes are rock solid and the bristles
are breaking off well this is so rough
and so brittle feels like my split ends
looking good not so bad not so bad now
unfortunately I couldn't find any black
nail polish at the dollar store but I
did find black acrylic paint and if
you're ever looking to do fine details
on your nails acrylic paint works
perfectly now if this were any other
nail art tutorial I would probably want
to draw a line in between the green rind
and the pink part of the watermelon just
to clean up that messy painting edge but
this is the smallest brush in the pack
and I can barely make the seeds any
smaller than this so I forgot about the
California nail jewels oh my god this is
completely dried up come on man I want
my dollar 25 back how about we add some
unicorns Stan first add it over the
whole nail and while it's still wet pick
up a nail jewel and put it right in the
center there perfect
but now let's try out these glamour
glitz because I'm representing my
country made in China what just be
careful because this hand still
isn't dry Keota here we've got Billy
Cosmetics purple purple haze
excuse me what this is red are you high
yeah Oh Canada our home and native land
true strong and they used to make us
sing that in French every single day for
eight years in grade school all right
well you know what's next
gotta add a nice maybe not so thick coat
of glossy diamond cosmetics super true
he couldn't use this before maybe it was
in my broke
Oh hacks video from like two years ago
sure been stuck for a million years
unopened ten million years spent on the
shelf
waiting to be bought at the Dollar Tree
been banned I can't open this
okay now let's steal this watermelon in
with the nice thin coat of glossy tacos
all right how did I do
there's definitely some nail polish
colors I didn't get to incorporate into
this look but overall I would say that
these turned out pretty close to what I
expected however the fact that a lot of
these products were made in Canada might
mean that my dollar store nail art
experience might be very different from
yours if you're in the States
I'm just guessing that US dollar stores
don't have many products that were made
in Canada nothing is made in Canada
anymore only rare gems like me why did
you buy these Christine well this was
fun except that part where the elbow
broke my nail but other than that we're
gonna survive I think generally I am
someone who is willing to spend a little
bit more on nail care products and nail
polishes that's because that is
something that is really important to me
and we can all decide what we want to
invest a little bit more on you know
I've gotta allocate our expenses within
budget and if you haven't noticed I
invest a lot in my nail polish
collection and I save my money in other
areas such as the fact that I still have
an iPhone 5se stop making fun of me
please thank you I just like the smaller
phones please never break before you
leave make sure to subscribe press the
bell alright everybody thanks so much
for watching and I'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
