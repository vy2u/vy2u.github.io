else would it be and today we're gonna
put dragons on our nails now this look
is actually called a triple scales
gradient whoa I mean that's what I
decided to call it a year ago when I
made it up in my head but it kind of
looks like dragon scales to people who
have no idea what I'm talking about so
I'm just gonna coat with that for the
title of this tutorial now I'm showing
you me applying my base coat not because
I want to invite comments of ignorance
about my lol but because I want to show
you that for once I'm not using a
peel-off base coat and instead I'm using
a regular sticky base coat because I'm
going to be doing a whole lot of feeling
off of nail vinyls and simply peel stuff
around my nail and I do not want to risk
peeling off this nail art as I go cuz
it's a lot of work as you'll see
whenever you're doing a gradient where
different colors will overlap each other
it's best to test out how that's all
going to go down on paper first so
usually I would suggest layering darker
colors over top of lighter colors but in
this case I did the exact opposite
because this gold is so metallic and
very rich in pigment and it's by quote
from Shoppers Drug Mart Yakko Canada
started from the bottom now we're here
so I just start off by painting my nail
with one base color which based on my
executive decision making is the darkest
color if you happen to not know how to
paint your nails properly you can also
use the cleanup brush like I do I get
mine from twinkle tea because they are
excellent and they do not break down
with acetone don't forget to use Mac
code simply for 10% off because
got to save money for hollow now simply
peel if you've never met her before
ladies she is your best friend when it
comes to doing gradients simply peel is
the reason why you may even consider
attempting this nail art because
otherwise you'd be like hell no that is
way too much mass all over my cuticles
just get her up on in there real nice
and close so you don't have to do barely
any cleanup
she also sparkles when she's dry because
she is an angel or a vampire I don't
know I forget the rules
grab a latex free makeup sponge and
we're gonna start applying the nail
polishes in order of the gradient oh my
god this red though it's like a vampire
sucked out all of my blood and a
unicorn's came in it that was highly
inappropriate remember you got to make
this gradient very narrow because you're
only gonna paint a third of the nail
with this particular gradient so this is
where you got to put your strategy hat
on and plan in advance and make sure
that you're focusing your first
gradients super close to the base of the
nail because you're gonna need to leave
enough room to make your second and then
your third gradient oh my god wait stop
the polish on my other end is so pretty
though I'm instantly regretting my
decision to use Reds in this why didn't
I use green dragon scales why well I
guess you could do the same manicure in
green or any color combination you want
so I'm just repeating the sponging on of
the first gradient section scale you
section thingy because I want it to be
nice and opaque and right away while
your nail polish is still wet you can
peel off simply feel like no big deal
because the peel is so satisfying I'm
gonna do it again and my other finger
because it just
so good and I wanted to show you it
twice oh and also the reason why I
showed you that was to show you how well
she works and why you need her next
you're gonna apply a quick dry top coat
and this is not optional you must do
this if you don't do this step then you
can stop at this nail art level one
right here and exit the game goodbye
make sure you let it dry completely I'm
talking like 20 full minutes as long as
it's a good quick drying top coat
because now we're going to add nail
vinyls yes you can really use whatever
kind of pattern nail vinyl you want that
has an interesting shape in this case
I'm just using chevron slash zigzag
whatever you want to call them finals
from twinkle tea to get kind of like a
scaly effect the second section of the
scales gradient will begin right along
the edge of the vinyl so I'm just
masking off the sides of my nails and on
the other side of the vinyl with some
more simply feel because you never know
if I'm gonna be messy because by this
point the nail polish from your sponge
will already be dried up you just cut
that section right off and bam you got a
fresh sponge remember to keep your
gradient color layers very narrow
because again this is section 2 of 3 we
still need room for a third one at the
tip of the nail so a tip here is no
matter what color you've chosen to start
at the base of the nail always use that
one to start at the base of the sponge
too because I know that I put the gold
right at the edge of the sponge when I
go to sponge it on my nail I know
exactly where I'm placing it in relation
to the nail vinyl so I only needed to do
two coats again because this polish is
super opaque and then I just peel off
the simply keel and the nail vinyl while
the polish is still wet and we're
getting there we've got two of three
dragon scales and we're on our way to
breathing fire of course you could stop
here if you have short nails but because
my nails are super long right now I'm
gonna go for all three yeah going for it
gonna do it yeah add a quick dry top
coat and let dry completely because
we're gonna repeat the exact same steps
we just did accept further down the nail
I know if you're doing this at home it
must be lunch or something by now and
you're probably really hungry but don't
worry just give it another two hours and
then you can eat your sandwich I don't
really need to be adding simply peel
around the sides of my nails because
there's like no space to be even put it
there but I can't stop putting it
everywhere it's so satisfying to peel
off okay I have a problem you will too
when you get it again make sure your
gradient is super narrow on your sponge
because at this point you're probably
looking at your nail like oops um I
didn't leave enough space at the end of
my nail because I didn't think enough
ahead did I that's why not everyone is
good at chess okay and for some of us we
will only ever be good at checkers peel
all that off and oh yeah you would
dragon you so fierce Queen Bay would be
proud add another glossy top coat and I
swear this is the last one I promise I
often get the question but isn't that
too many coats of nail polish isn't it
too thick that is just not good and
honestly I've never found that doing
this many coats of nail polish and top
coats makes my nails feel any thicker as
long as you've properly applied your
base coat
wrap the tips with the Polish and the
top coat then your nails aren't going to
be any more prone to chipping then if
you did a manicure with half the amount
of coats the overall thickness would
also depend on the nail polish formula
that you've chosen to use so for example
it would not be smart to do this kind of
scaled gradient with a thick glitter
polish that wouldn't make any sense so
you can use the same scale gradient
technique with different types of nail
vinyl shapes and you don't have to do a
triple scale gradient but you can do a
double so it looks like this with
regular Chevron nail vinyls or like this
with starburst vinyls or like this with
two different types of gradient colors
with wave vinyls or fire vinyls yes I
love these ones and here's some proof
you can do exactly what I did on my
nails today
two skills but on very short nails I did
these like a year ago you can also go
crazy and do four scales of all
different colors or go even crazier and
do a reciprocal scale for you yes I know
it doesn't make sense but I also made a
video on it making more sense you can go
watch that too
either way you play that gradient dragon
girl you slit now here's to hoping my
tutorials make more sense this year than
they did last year if you do a scaled
gradient on your nail don't forget to
hashtag scaled gradients so I can see
them one day in the future All Right see
y'all later back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
