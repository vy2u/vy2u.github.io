shit please send help and rescue thank
you well hallo everyone it's me
christine again and today we're gonna
test out some new salon chrome kits by
sally hansen you guys requested i review
these because they are widely available
in the drugstore and everyone wants to
know if they work or if they work like
shit but first I have to sing you a song
it's beginning to look a lot play hello
new merge Lincoln bio a cozy sweater
tradition they're only limited edition
so quick you better shop the link below
so these are nail powders and they come
in five different shades mermaid or
Sehun don't mind the French peacock
gunmetal rose gold and holographic who
you know Mama's likes that one now those
of you who watch me for nail art know
that we've seen a lot of different nail
powders and flakes come out in the last
year or two and they've mostly all come
from indie nail brands or direct from
China from nail art suppliers or
otherwise just not readily available in
the drugstore 2017 you gotta buy
everything online so that's why I think
these Sally Hansen nail powders are
somewhat of a big deal beauty media also
seemed really excited about the launch
of these powders I think partly because
Sally Hansen was marketing them as an
alternative to going to the nail salon
the kits were also advertised on Sally
Hansen's Instagram let's see what
Christine dings about - and they
appeared to have sponsored some nail
bloggers who posted video tutorials
using the powders let me just be clear I
think sponsorships can be a great thing
because it means big companies like
Sally Hansen see the value in supporting
influencers like nail bloggers but I
think we'd still all agree that if an
influencer didn't like the product it's
unlikely the brand would allow them to
express that in the sponsored post
because at the end of the day it is an
advertisement that the brand is paying
for basically you're usually not allowed
to shit on a product if you're being
paid to promote it so with that said
this video is not sponsored which means
I can say whatever the fuck I want who's
ready for simply savage logical I'm just
kidding I'm already biased haven't even
started the video yet whoo okay let's
get into it
each salon chrome kit comes in a box and
includes instructions on the back a
special topcoat the nail powder one I
shadow applicator I love these and the
hollow kit also includes two additional
bottles which the other kits do not
clewd apparently you're supposed to buy
them separately that's a black base coat
and a clear taco let's try the mermaid
powder first the instructions say to
start with two thin coats of Sally
Hansen's black polish in black II oh wow
milky black polish my favorite please
kill me now by the way I'm just using
some nail test swatches because we've
got a lot of experiments to do today
with two coats of black it's mostly
covered still a little bit sheer but oh
well the instructions say to wait two to
three minutes until it tacky then I can
go ahead and dip my sponge applicator
into the powder and rub it gently on the
nail watch effect appear to be a time
kind of under well now we add a layer of
this special effect topcoat which to me
just looks like a water-based topcoat
which means that it's probably designed
to act as a sealant for the chrome
effect powders because adding a regular
tatha right on top of the powdered layer
would probably crack and ruin it or just
reduce the shine oh look now I have
mermaid on my brush now we got to wait
five minutes for a minute will last step
the final seal with Sally Hansen's
topcoat
it actually looks more shimmery and less
pure chromey than it did before I added
the two top coats interesting
interesting interesting so let's hold
our analysis until the end and go ahead
and try the other four types of powders
this powder looks very similar to the
last it will probably just yield a
slightly different hue why you know it's
more purplish blue rather than green I
can tell you right now I'm not really a
fan of this type of powder because it's
not actually chrony it basically just
tints the black and while it is shiny it
is nowhere near as chromia some of the
other chrome powders i've tried like if
you wanted real multi chrome nails then
you should get actual multi chrome
powder it's a far superior cut powder in
my opinion now let's try gunmetal so
this powder just looks like cocaine guys
I can't stop with the drug references
it's really hard when all I'm do is play
with powder all day what that is very
strange to me like again if they really
wanted a gunmetal silvery chrome look
then they could have went to the
actually chrome powder supplier I don't
know to me this just kind of looks like
a shittier version of the chrome powder
and yes you may be noticing some denting
we'll talk about that in a bit
rose gold okay this one looks so pretty
though like 2013 Michael Kors watches
the powder itself actually looks really
nice I kind of want to put it on my eyes
I don't understand where did the the
rose gold part go this just looks like a
pinkish purple version of the others
this does not look rose gold to me at
all especially not compared to what is
presented on the package now maybe they
put a different color polish under it
and you can absolutely do that and it
will change the color but the box says
to use the black so
okay here's the last powder and we got
to ask ourselves the really important
question is it really hello oh my god I
know myself and I say that so right off
the bat the powder does look like it's
real hollow it looks very similar to the
other hollow powders that I've used the
less tested out oh my god yes I see the
rainbows and you'll notice now more than
the others had a lot of difficulty
actually applying it on the nail because
the base kept kind of coming up and
sticking to the applicator we'll go over
the challenges next but to answer the
most important question yes it is real
hollow can you imagine that a major
brand labeling something with
holographic correctly now I was curious
if we really have to use the Sally
Hansen Blackie oh because honestly it
kind of sucks so I applied one coat of
my favorite black polish that's right
only one coat I let it dry for a bit
just so it was tacky and then I tried
buffing in one of the powders and yeah
the powders didn't really stick the same
way that they did with the Sally Hansen
base so I will give them that I'm not
sure you can use this with any nail
polish you want as the base coat now
what about the fact that I kept getting
dents as I was applying the powder box
says you got to use light pressure only
which I did but honestly I found it
really tricky to fully buff the powder
into the nail without disturbing or
pushing up the base because it is tacky
after all and that's why you see a lot
of dents which are not the result of a
shady powder but rather the result of a
very challenging application method and
so for that reason I decided what if we
tested these nail powders using gel
topcoat because if you put the nail
powders on top of a cure gel topcoat
it's so much easier to apply and it
yields a much smoother finish in my
experience as a nut nail professional
let me walk you through it in case
you're new to gel tacos black base coat
doesn't matter which black it's just
regular black polish not gel then apply
one coat of no wipe gel topcoat that
just means you don't have to wipe a
sticky layer after curing then you got
to bake that shit for a minute
and I feel like people think these
devices are very hard to come by when
they're actually readily available for
pretty cheap off Amazon
put some links to the gel tacos and the
caring machines down below in the video
description box after just one minute of
caring you can buff the powder in it see
how much easier that looks I mean maybe
it doesn't look so different from you
coming from the perspective of watching
me do the sunscreen if you compare it to
the Sally Hansen method using regular
polishes applying it over a gel taco
it's just so much smoother looking let's
try the hollow oh look at that
super easy smooth application I did this
experiment in part so we could see the
true quality of the nail powders without
the bias of a potentially shitty
application method such as using the
regular polishes the Sally Hansen method
way so in other words this is what the
powders look like at their best the
hollow one actually looks pretty damn
good so good that I want to compare it
to powders from indie brands so I redid
some swatches and from what I can tell
the Sally Hansen hollow powder is pretty
good quality I would say it's just as
Hollow but the particles aren't quite as
dense as some of the other ones I have
and generally speaking it just looks way
better over a gel topcoat than the Sally
Hansen method
here's me redoing some swatches just to
show you even more what I mean
exact same salad Hanson holographic
powders used on both swatches on the
left it was applied over a cured gel
topcoat and on the right the same powder
was applied using the sally hansen
method with regular polish i
hypothesized that the tacky base layer
doesn't really allow you to properly and
fully buff in the hollow powder because
it is sticky and it's not smooth and
thus it doesn't yield a truly reflective
kind of Cromie looking finish ok let's
go back to these more iridescent looking
powders because i have an experiment
these sally hansen ones look very
similar to these other ones I have from
born pretty store that were like 10
times deeper I am really curious to see
how similar these are or if they are the
same thing the born pretty store ones
are not properly labeled so I have no
idea which shade this is I'm just using
the gel taco method because it's the
easiest to see how the powder actually
performs and they look pretty similar to
me
maybe the born pretty one is slightly
more saturated in color but honestly
it's looking pretty similar let's try
another shade this is so much fun being
a detective
last time I was a hollow glitter
cappuccino detective and today we
inspecting nail powders okay that color
is off so that's not the exact same
shade at least let's try another one
that's pretty damn close I mean we don't
have any definite conclusions here but
they look pretty similar and considering
that the Sally Hansen ones are made in
China I would not be surprised if they
have the same supplier now I was so
disappointed by this rose gold that
doesn't thing with rose gold here is
what is much closer to a true rose gold
chrome finish powder again it's from
born pretty store for like very little
money and this is what I thought that
the Sally Hansen powder was supposed to
look like obviously it's not a dupe
I just think Sally Hansen ordered the
wrong shade from China alright I think
it's time to finally put some of this
shit on my nails although it's gonna be
really hard because my nails are
currently multi chrome and topped with
diamond flake taco
but get excited ladies and gentlemen
cause it's time for some Pele it's been
a long day watching this long-ass video
you deserve it alright we're gonna do
this the Sally Hansen way but I am still
gonna start out for the peel off base
coat don't tell them
one thin coat of Sally Hansen Blacky Oh
polish
I still want to die now we need a second
coat wait exactly two to three minutes
and now I'm gonna start with my pinky
finger and buffing the hollow powder oh
you know I was gonna go for Hollow
but then for some reason I struggled so
fucking much
trying to buff this stupid powder into
my nail the tacky black polish was just
like too tacky but also not tacky enough
in some areas so the powder was either
not sticking because the Polish had
dried or it was sticking so much that it
was actually ripping up with my sponge
applicator and I was not going hard okay
you know like I like my hollow and I go
hard usually I'm honestly not trying to
make this product look like shit I just
really struggle with this type of
application method and I don't think
it's that easy for the average consumer
so if me someone who's used like dozens
of different nail powders can't do this
properly not sure how the average person
walking into Ulta or Target will find
this experience when they are sold on
the idea that they can do it themselves
perfectly and they don't need to go to a
salon now for the skeptics out there who
are probably gonna comment you didn't
try let's peel it all off and do this
again please accept my apologies for the
cringy peel porn it was too wet
this time we're gonna use a regular base
coat instead of a pilaf just in case
that happened to be the problematic
factor in the last experiment apply two
coats of Sally Hansen black polish
waited just over two and a half minutes
I tried to be even more gentle this time
and was more padding on the hollow as
opposed to rubbing it it's almost like
any time you actually try to rub this
shit in the applicator just lifts up the
base but the problem is if you're not
truly buffing in the hollow powder then
it kind of just looks like you've dusted
a bunch of Hollow on your nail until
you're not getting that really nice
clean linear hollow smooth finish
god dammit Sally how did the sponsor now
bloggers make this look good because I
don't understand
maybe I just really suck at this regular
nail polish application method but I
personally find it so much easier to
apply it over gel I feel like sometimes
people are really overwhelmed by the DIY
gel method that I showed earlier and
honestly I was one of those people at
first I was like gel polish that that's
complicated and like for professionals
but really it's not it's super simple
and it's not that expensive to just get
one lamp and a gel taco and that's all
you need if you want to play with these
kinds of powders any of the powders the
hollow the multi chrome the shimmer
whatever I highly recommend trying it
over a gel topcoat you can use regular
polish underneath just let it dry fully
trust me the application will go ten
times smoother as it is not susceptible
to shitty dents and smudges like this
method right here all right Pham let's
conclude I mean in some parts it applied
pretty smoothly but for the most part
not so much my nails look like I
actually dove in the hollow trash may
that's a good thing if you're looking
for a distressed grunge look but it's
not really using the hollow powder for
what it can truly offer which is a
beautiful smooth linear hollow finish
alright so in conclusion what I
recommend these Sally Hansen chrome kits
to you the answer is simply no and aside
from the hollow powder I find that the
payoff and effect of the other four
powders were pretty underwhelming well
there goes any Sally Hansen sponsorship
opportunities I'm guessing that was a
done deal ever since Rob said this on my
channel oh it's Sally Hansen that bitch
on that note thanks so much for watching
and
see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
