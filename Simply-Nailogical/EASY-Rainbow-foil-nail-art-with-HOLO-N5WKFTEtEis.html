got some holographic nails cuz what else
do you see on this channel but first
everyone is asking me where is part 2 -
how to cheat a water marble I assure you
it will be up sometime next week ish and
then they'll be a part 3 the next week
ish after that and maybe a part 4 it
depends now back to today's very
important lesson I started out with a
plain black base coat because I knew I
was gonna do something with rainbow and
hollows which look best with black it's
basic science now my objective today was
to try out nail foils and this was one
of them look at that amazing black
hollow but it didn't really work out and
I ended up using this rainbow one
instead not to worry I will personally
take you through all my trials and
tribulations so this is what they call
foil glue and it has no labels anywhere
so I forget where it's from and because
it's glue I immediately begin to hate it
I thought it would be cool to make my
entire nail black hollow foil so I just
put the glue everywhere you gotta let it
dry just until it's no longer white take
your nail foil and you're supposed to
stick it directly onto the nail ugly
side face down that's the side that's no
Hollow boo but look let's not forget
what's on my other hand
today I'm sporting a classic silver
linear hollow that every girl
boy or cat needs in their collection
it's really a timeless classic I put the
link below now back to this I pressed it
firmly down on my nail but hey funny
story the first time I tried foil nails
back in Christine fetus days I put the
foil on upside down and I put the shiny
part on my nail he doesn't that make
sense he put on your nail what you want
to transfer on your nail but I guess
I've never even been good at things like
knowing which way to put printer paper
in a printer so maybe you shouldn't
listen to me anyways now I go to peel
off the foil and well I guess I
shouldn't be wearing a peel-off base
coat on the bright side if you can't get
your peel off base coat to peel off now
you know what to do so then I kept it to
feet and started over with a regular
base coat I hate when I have to get a
regular pink polish my nails in black
again put on the glue and then I put the
black foil over top and it did the same
thing and just wouldn't transfer it I
forgot to film it so you don't have any
evidence and you'll just have to trust
me believe me it makes me so sad to the
black hollow foil was a lot and then I
needed some guidance so I obviously look
to a hollow topcoat get the way Charlie
got the way so I slapped her on a
freshly black polish nail though wasn't
sure where I was gonna go from here but
that's part of my process okay it's like
my nails are part of a galaxy in outer
space minus the dying part because of
the air or lack of air I'm not sure so
my plan from there was after I let a
quick dry top coat dry I took one of
these triangles cyclone nail vinyls
Illuminati confirmed
stick it on my nail and then add the
foil glue on top of the vinyl forgot to
film that part I decided to try some
rainbow foil because I know it's worked
in the past remember these nails
probably not
these were before the simply analogical
voiceover era again anyways this was
clearly not working I suspect it was too
challenging for the foil to completely
lay itself down flat in between the nail
vinyl spaces and I peeled it off and it
looked like nothing I did it on another
nail and it looked better but the
pattern I was picturing still wasn't
there and again I had to remove my nail
polish with nail polish remover is
terrible repeat all the basic steps and
so finally I came to my senses and
decided it would be best if I just stuck
with a simple design good idea simply
now logical
so I filled in a simple deep v-shape
with the foil glue and right away peeled
up the nail vinyl remember to let the
foil glue dry just until it's not white
lightly place the foil over top of the
sticky part with the colored side up and
you see that slight separation of the
foil from the film itself that's what's
supposed to happen and what did not
happen with the black foil that failed
me when it's pretty obvious that all the
foil has transferred onto your nail just
gently peel up the film and voila that's
so cool
now we must address a common fear that
nail E's have when using nail files will
a topcoat dull the shininess naturally
it was time to do experiments I test
first with a linear hollow topcoat and
then a clear quick dry top coat and then
I realized oh wait I'm dumb because I'm
testing on the clear film part but it's
the foil underneath that's actually on
my nail how to test you so I put some
foil glue on one of my silicone mats and
then I put the foil on top of that
what it looks like when your genius idea
isn't genius I guess it has something to
do with the silicon not wanting to stick
science is holding up this experiment
I'm going to proceed anyways I try to
click dry top coat a linear hollow and
it's clear that this linear Hollow is
definitely dulling the foil so I tried a
couple other different types of hollow
top coats because I'm not keeping up on
the hollow and I settled on this
scattered hollow because it did not dull
the foil and come to think of it this
scattered hollow works out pretty good
for this design because it kind of looks
like I'm on an outer space mission I
added a glossy top coat on top of the
hollow which wouldn't affect the foil
because it already has a layer in
between it how cool is this brush though
I'm testing out a new glossy top coat
but it's not even out yet so there's no
point telling you what it is one day my
children one day now welcome to the
Space Jam here's your chance
hollow dance that's a space down alright
alright alright I could not find a
karaoke version of that song because
that song is like it's ancient as I am
anyways hope you liked this video and
