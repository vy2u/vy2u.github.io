oh my god hello everyone it's me
Christine and today's the day where the
cats out of the bag
that's right I've come up with some cat
nail vinyls three different kinds for
you because I am an obsessed cat lady I
can't help it
Benji is so proud right now you can find
my new cat designs at the link below in
the video description box and you can
only find them there unless someone
steals them please don't steal my ideas
thanks Kay bye and I'm starting out with
a white creamy base coat damn Kristine
back at it again with the white base
coat okay that joke is so old by now I
know everyone is sick of damn Daniel I
know the feeling you get when you
realize that your boyfriend is the one
who ruined your simply peel tips you
don't know how to apply it simply feels
you're not supposed to keep dabbing on
it I think we shouldn't be yes it is the
evidence of his guilt is very clear in
my my boyfriend does my nails video you
can check it out for yourself I place
all the blame on him pretty sure he just
didn't close the cap of the bottle Oh
boyfriend it's a good thing I like you
so I actually tried to save my simply
peel by microwaving it but it didn't
work at all and it just turned into a
warm squishy bulb it was kind of like
lactating with glitter weird luckily I
still had a good bottle of simply peel
but the brush was stuff from some other
event a long time ago but apparently you
can actually by simply peel replacement
brushes from the cynthy peel website has
no matter how good the latex product is
sometimes latex just has a mind of its
own it feels like drawing up and being
all crusty so I just jammed the new
brush into the cap and ah beautiful
perfect new satisfying bottle of simply
peel yes I know my nails are a different
color which doesn't coincide with this
video
sometimes I publish my videos in the
wrong order that they were actually
filmed so timelines may seem like they
don't make sense anyways now that I've
rescued simply peel I'm gonna slap her
all around my finger to prevent her from
said death by gradient and I'm going to
be doing a returning gradient which
means that the color on one end of the
gradient will return to the same color
by the other end of the gradient I don't
know if the rest of the nail art
community uses this term I started using
it and I just use it because it makes
sense in my head okay give that a little
dab dab dab on the nail this is why I
hate cremes and we're just going to
repeat that gradient process another two
or three times because these polishes
are not opaque at all now for the white
the white is very opaque the Pink's are
not by the time you're done your nail
polish is all thick and nasty so you can
just go ahead and peel off simply peel
like no big deal and do any little extra
cleanup you may need to do now on two of
my nails I decided to do a different
gradient because why because why why
probably so I could just show off my
peel again for you peel porn now I had a
quick dry top coat cuz we're gonna add
nail vinyls not the brass new models to
ever be invented I'm so excited I can't
contain myself can you tell always let
dry for at least fifteen minutes if
you're using a good quick dry top coat I
put my favorite at the link below in the
video description box and here's the
first three different cat nail vinyls
yay I mean yeah these are kind of like
Chevron's or stripes or french tips
except they're cat ears so they're way
better and I'm gonna fill in my little
cat head with black hollow because what
else is appropriate nothing nothing else
is appropriate there's definitely more
than one way to use these caddy or
vinyls you could also use them as a
French tip I'm totally gonna do that and
make a video on french tip nail art that
isn't boring one day I got so many
commitments to you guys make sure to
peel off the vinyl while the polish is
still wet and round you slay kitty cat
slay this final is the actual full
complete head of the cat not just the
ears and these are cats were vinyls
look at that cute little tail don't you
just want to pull it use cat swirls are
pretty versatile because you could use
them whether you have long nails or
short nails so I can fit two of these on
my long nails but if you have short
nails you can definitely fit one of them
no problem so the idea is that this will
fit on any size nail bed whether it's
narrow or short or long or wide whatever
cat vinyl equality for all these are so
much fun to peel though that's my
favorite part
but you know it's even more fun to peel
these ones these are cat cyclone nail
vinyls and oh my god Cyclones are my
favorite if they can make you dizzy just
by peeling them and then you get sucked
into their kitty cat trance on a serious
helpful note using a flat tool it's just
a cuticle tool as I'm doing and rotating
the sheet around as you press the tool
under one layer of the cat cyclone is
probably the best way to remove a
cyclone from a vinyl without ruining
everything then you just pick it up and
you're good to go
these vinyls can be a little bit
trickier to place but I like to start by
pressing down on the head of the kitty
cat and then adjusting the edges of the
ears as you go around the cat's icons
are a little bit bigger than the cat
swirls oh hey there it's about time we
asked what's on my other hand it's a
dreamy champagne platinum flaky polish
with holographic particles in it that I
kind of want to take a vacation in it
looks like a sandy beach of heaven
life's a beach where hollow back to the
cat by the way this black hollow is
really opaque I barely need to do one
coat well obviously I'm just doing one
coat but you know what I mean right like
you can read my mind so I don't need to
say things there's no point in this
voiceover you just know what I'm
thinking isn't that correct and now
we're gonna do what we're all thinking I
want to see you peel that kitty cat
Kristine peel that could eat cat wait go
back a second how cool is it that you
peel the cat by the tail
I find that so amusing nananananananana
cat man that's Catwoman to you bitch now
I'm adding a glossy top coat to seal in
this accomplishment in my life where I
have finally achieved Kat vinyl goals
now these like super kids don't they I
mean they're pink and everything but
there's a touch of badass with the black
hollow so I'm still okay I'm still sane
but I feel like they're missing
something
manche what do you think men Chi
obviously I'm missing men she'd the cat
Hollow polish how could I do cat nails
and not use that polish that is just
rude that you didn't think it was
possible for a cat to have their own
nail polish if I mentioned a cat's
hollow glitter that she designed all by
herself at the link below please don't
hurt me if it's sold out you can save
yourself from some anger by signing up
to be notified when it's back in stock
so that way home to kill anybody to get
this damn polish it often goes out of
stock because all the hollow sexuals
keep buying it but I expect it to be
back in stock soon should I even explain
what I'm doing or you guys know what's
going on right here right yet yeah you
do it's just a little fancy glitter
gradient correction hollow glitter
gradient and I didn't really know where
to add mentions holo on my other nails
so I just kind of put it inside the cat
head where to put the hollow this
struggle is real I can't fit that much
hollow inside of the pussycat head I
added a final glossy top coat I know
this is like the third time because I
want the hollow glitter to be embalmed
in my nails okay that's really morbid
wait a second no it's not I have nine
lives
anyways actually probably more than that
because Hollow gives you immortality I
am immortal join me on my quest to
locate the land of eternal unicorn peace
and freedom and we will fight some tiny
monster okay guys thank you so much for
watching and if you want to buy my
