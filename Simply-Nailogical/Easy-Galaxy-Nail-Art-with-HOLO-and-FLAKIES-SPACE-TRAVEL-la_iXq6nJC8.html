are doing crazy weird on their
nails because it's Halloween and I'm
gonna do a design that I'm going to sing
is for Halloween but really people do
this all year long galaxy nails because
we want the sky on our nails because we
are aliens clearly I always start off
with a black base coat or other dark
color whatever I'm using a black that's
discontinued so there's no point in me
telling you what it is because then
you're just going to be sad I'll find a
new black that's available for you one
day take one of those makeup sponges
that you usually use for gradients and
rip it apart like a mad person ah why
you know come apart
you're ruining my storyline I'm going to
use three new a England holographic
babies two of them are hollow but almost
get your simply PLL girl yet you've been
waiting for this haven't you simply
feels a liquid latex barrier that I'm
gonna use around my nail on my skin
because I'm gonna make big mess if I
don't and probably like yourself I'm
lazy and I don't want to clean up a lot
of mess there's really no order or logic
to the right galaxy nail design but I
like to start with the color that you
like least since this one doesn't have
hollow but just blue shimmer it
automatically goes on first it's also
probably not a bad idea to put on a
greyish or whitish color first on your
galaxy so it'll look like clouds or
something wait there's no clouds up in
the galaxies aren't scientists
astronauts people out there who know
what I mean you know what I mean so
whatever blue blue hollow my good so
pretty yes how deep is your Hollow
is like the ocean rainbow in motion yes
it is it's awesome
my holo is always as deep as the ocean
look at that
Wow so pretty sponge your next color on
and kind of layer it over your previous
color so you get kind of a fading effect
Wow
voila you are an artiste look at that
it's a masterpiece and you'd basically
do nothing so far yeah this paint gonna
pack a punch in this galaxy love this
dark raspberry cranberry color pink you
can find it at the link below in the
video description box along with the
rest of this new a England collection
blend your third color again by layering
it over your second and/or first color
again there's no science to this galaxy
can pretty much just put a clusterfuck
of colors anywhere you want in whatever
pattern just make sure you don't cover
up all the black because it should
probably resemble an actual galaxy at
least a little bit no galaxy is complete
without flakies that you thought I was
going to say stars didn't you flickies
are pretty much ground up stars from
space anyways so I think it's only
fitting that we put these on our nails
next this is from fun lacquers new
magical flaky collections we also find
it at the link below and that very
useful video description box first I
applied one coat of the flaky Plus holo
nail polish because we can't have a
galaxy without holo either but we need
more more flaky so many buddies I cannot
ever have enough see what did I tell you
these flaky czar anti-gravity yeah look
at that color shift this one is like a
green magical alien that landed from
Venus or Mars or Uranus if you're a
hater I want to maximize this flaky
payoff so I'm gonna take a little sponge
and dab it on down the center of this
nebula or other space terminology
reference that I've forgotten because I
haven't been to grade 8 in 10 years
probably more than that I'm also really
bad at math keep sponging it on down the
middle
much as you want and then pilaf simply
feel like no big deal except I totally
screwed up here because I waited too
long and the pink hollow spongy part had
too much time to dry I'll just fix that
with a toothpick like how I fix all my
life problems my cuticles are looking a
little dehydrated though from this space
mission so just take one of my empty
nail oil pens and use the residue on the
tip of the pen to just give me a little
bit of hydration you can also find that
at the link below in the video
description box what do you know holy
 Christine shut up you're so
annoying there are links below we get it
despite what I said earlier I guess I
should probably add some stars I just
really don't like painting or drawing
because I can't do it well look even the
acrylic paint doesn't want to get wet
for me why do you not draw smoothly I
don't know
does acrylic paint suck it like dries up
after 2 seconds anyways
try and draw tiny little stars but don't
make them too big like I'm doing right
here and trying to fix with the
toothpick again you can also take a tiny
tiny dotting tool and add a couple
little dots to make it seem like there's
other stars that are even further away
but you can't wish on because you'll
never be close to them all right let's
pop coat that top coat not taco
yeah trying out this new glossy top coat
I also got from a link below in the
video description box it's actually
pretty good it's the same brand as the
peel off base coat i use all the time
look at that shine so glossy so
satisfying oh yeah give me some of that
Doppler flaky shift these are totally
extra galactic masks gravitational
supernova terrestrial telemetry
hyperbolic orbiting magical and minutia
galaxies nails I just totally googled a
list of astronomy words so I can try and
sound smart truth is I'm just a data
analyst
not a space analyst but will dream of
being astronauts one day don't we
oh wait no one does that anymore oh
that's right we all dream of being jenna
Marbles
alright so that's shiny flaky galaxy but
everyone knows that when you put flakies
on your nails
you've got to matte all the flakies
eventually I'm using Essie smack about
you top coat to mattify this manicure
mattify is a verb that means make things
not shiny anymore
basically by modifying your nails it
just means that you're not going to have
any hard lights bouncing off the shiny
glossy top coat which means that you're
also going to be able to see the flaky
better but it also means that you will
sacrifice some of the hollow because
it's going to make it dull and less
rainbowy
generally I find that by modifying a
manicure that's sparkly you're going to
dull some of the color and it's going to
look less saturated but flakies they'll
look oh wow
decisions are so hard when you're an
adult alright there you go you got some
galaxy nails on your hands so many
different ways to do the Alex your nails
use whatever colors you want but a
better app holo and a federal flakies
that's the only criteria for it to be
awesome
now what do you think glossy galaxy or
matte galaxy comment down below let me
know cuz I care about you like I care
about holo
yeah on another wavelength bye
