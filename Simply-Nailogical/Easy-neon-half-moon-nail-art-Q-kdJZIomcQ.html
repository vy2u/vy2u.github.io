simple nail art for a change it's a half
moon mani as we like to call it in the
nail art freak world which basically
means that it's just a semicircle at the
bottom so yeah I kept things simple for
a bright neon summer look both polishes
are from Live Love polish links are
below as always I'm using Color club's
french tip nail polish because it's so
much creamier than those milky white
other polishes of their in the world
apply a quick dry top coat you should
always do this before applying nail
vinyls that way you won't rip off the
base polish when you go to peel off the
nail vinyl so let it dry I usually wait
about 15 minutes and then I'm using some
nail vinyls here that are half moon or
semicircle or whatever you want to call
them like whole reinforcement shape and
I'm just placing it at the bottom of my
nail and painting on a models own polish
called shades and damn girl you need
shades this polish is bright it's a
super intense creamy neon coral pinkish
reddish orangish I don't even know what
color you call this but it's amazing you
should definitely have this color and
your neon polish collection this summer
pull off the nail vinyl right away to
get a nice clean line and then instead
of using an angled eyeliner brush and
acetone I often just kind of push off
the nail polish while it's still wet put
the toothpick around the edges if it
happened to get on my finger now let's
make things a little more interesting
because this would have been so boring
to me otherwise I'm using a dotting tool
from Live Love polish it's model's own
brand and I'm just kind of dotting the
white dots around the moon shape and I
ended up wanting them a lot bigger than
the dotting tool actually was so that's
why I'm kind of dabbing a couple times
around in a circle
so not really a perfect circle but
whatever in the middle the dots I'm
adding one of my favorite loose hollow
glitters this is a teal or aqua colored
hollow glitter from twinkle teeth don't
forget to use my code simply for 10% off
your entire order do it now buy all the
loose cleanings then I'm bored so I'm
just gonna add some more white dust cuz
why not
so it took a smaller dotting tool and
add another line of dots and I'm like
hey I'm so bored let me add another line
of smaller dots and then I was like okay
Christine you should probably stop
that's enough add a glossy top coat and
there you go some super easy nails for
summer or any time of the year I don't
really care if it's summer I'll wear
neons all the time I wear these in my
office job I don't care all right well
thanks for watching guys see you next
time well actually I won't see you and
you probably won't see me I don't know
but you'll hear me so thanks for
listening I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
