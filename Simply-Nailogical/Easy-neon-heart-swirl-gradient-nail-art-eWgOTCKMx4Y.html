tutorial because you haven't seen enough
neon stuff on my channel yet today I'll
be doing a super cute heart gradient
thing and it's actually so easy to do
because all it is is using a nail vinyl
and a makeup sponge as per usual I'm
starting off with a white opaque base
coat and I'm using Color Club French tip
it's designed for a french tip nails
well obviously but I use it as a white
base coat like a regular nail polish
because it's a lot thicker than your
average white nail polish like this
milky yucky mess like I don't want milta
on my nails I want like creamy like
white out white remember white out like
from grade school when you used to paint
your nails with liquid white oh yeah
don't what
you remember occasionally the French tip
formula does get a little thick and
harder to work with so when that happens
just take some nail polish thinner throw
a few drops in the bottle shake it up
and you're good to go add a quick dry
top coat because if you don't your nail
vinyls will rip up the base coat and
then your nails will look ugly make sure
you wait at least 15 minutes before
starting to use nail vinyls before I
start sponging on colors with a gradient
and make a huge mess out of my fingers I
apply simply feel latex barrier and you
can watch my little hunger games for
peel-off products at the link in the top
left corner you want to see who came out
as the winner and spoiler alert it would
simply peel you can by simply peel from
the link below the video description box
and if you ask me if it's worth it it
definitely is and you really need to buy
it to find out do it papaya I do it now
once the liquid latex is dry which takes
only 23 minutes I grab my heart
swirl nail vinyls from twinkle tea calm
these are super cool and super cute and
like I could not draw a heart on my
nails if I tried so that's why nail
vinyls are really important for people
like me and probably people like you
you can use my code simply to get 10%
off your entire order I used to have
technical difficulties we could call it
removing these nail vinyls from the
plastic so what I found was easiest to
do without mucking up the vinyl and then
having it stick to itself and then it's
a waste new I don't use a whole other
vinyl is to take a small metal tool on
say don't even know what this tool is
for I think it's a cuticle pusher I'm
not sure but basically any tool that's
flat and semi sharp enough to start
peeling up the vinyl from underneath so
if you do that and rotate the sheet
around as you go then you'll get the
right part of the vinyl to start
unpeeling itself and then just take some
tweezers and pull it up when you're done
yes these vinyls and all the swirly ones
aren't super easy to work with but
they're also like not rocket science
like really guys just like take your
tweezers and like move it around as you
need you can see here you can kind of
change the width of the heart if you
wanted to and then you can easily just
adjust it to what best fits your nail
press down everywhere on the vinyl so
that it's secure on the nail and then
make sure to leave a little bit of pale
behind so that it's easy to peel off
when you're done it has a tail like a
cat cats have tails and I love cats I'm
using three neon polishes from Live Love
polish and the link to them is below in
the video description box I've really
been into gradients that don't make
sense lately like yellow doesn't
necessarily fade to bright coral it
doesn't really say too blue either but I
don't really care I kind of like the
third different take that makeup sponge
and dab dab dab on the nail stop dub dub
dub dub
dub dub dub dub so neon after one coat I
know
repeat for a second time as soon as
you're done your last gradient sponge on
the nail take your pair of tweezers and
peel up that little cat - now this is
the fun part kids and this is why I like
instead of you doing your homework you
just tell your parents like but killing
vinyls is so much more fun than masks
and all that work that you just did was
so easy and like everyone will think
you've hand-painted hearts on your nails
but really you didn't you just cheated
and use nail file personally I don't
think using nail vinyls is cheating in
the nail art world I think it's genius
and anyone who says using nail vinyls is
cheating is an idiot cuz it's so much
fun let's watch it again on my other
nail yeah you know that that's hard here
oh it's so pretty if a tiny bit of
gradient mass gets left behind have no
fear the cleanup brush is here so I'm
using my brand-new cleanup brush that I
got from twinkle tea and I was super
excited start using it because my other
one got eaten alive by acetone first I
just take a toothpick and kind of push
out any large clump ease and then I take
the cleanup brush dip it in a hundred
percent acetone and start going around
the edges very carefully for that
perfect round finish them a few people
have asked me before why nail artists
leave a gap between the cuticle and the
nail it's because they clean them with a
nail art brush and a stone start doing
it yes you because acetone can dry the
skin and leave it with a weird whitish
look you got to hydrate it before you
take pictures now oil is the best way to
do this and I usually use my bliss kiss
nail oil pen but I found that it's too
easy to add too much nail oil then all
the sudden you got greasy hands and no
one wants a picture of super greasy
hands so instead of using a full nail
pen I'll use one of my empty ones
there's still a tiny bit of
I left in the brush but it's just enough
to add a little bit of hydration without
making my nails look like a Kim
Kardashian photoshoot you can rub it in
to help spread the oil around and add a
glass of topcoat now every time you see
something sticking off with something
else you're just going to go on appeal
at aren'tcha
after I took these pictures I decided I
wanted to see what it looked like math
because neon math is so in these days so
I added a se matte topcoat and there
yeah it looks pretty cool Matt - what do
you know alright thanks for watching
make sure you stay tuned for next week
when I'm gonna do a water marble that's
right you heard me
I committed atomic my to doing a water
marble for a weekly nail art challenge

done cuz I really don't want to do this
so make sure you tune in next week to
see how not to water marble or mostly so
