yeah I figured I would do something like
that because that's what all the cool
kids it's like actually reputable
accounts on YouTube are doing so anyways
here's my mani for today it's kind of a
badass edgy gradient if you ask me so I
co host a weekly challenge on Instagram
and today's prompt was fishtail so
nothing about fish it kind of looks like
a braid and I think people confuse this
as a braid braid fishtail herringbone I
don't know I don't even know if I got
this right is this a fishtail nail art
world I'm not sure in any case this was
my second attempt at the fishtail menu
because I did this one first and it kind
of just looks like one of those color
blind tests where you're supposed to
figure out what the pattern or the
number is and I still can't figure it
out I kind of thought it turned out like
a nail fail so I didn't make a video on
it but why don't you guys tell me do you
like this enough do you even want a
tutorial on this because if you say yes
then I will make you one and let's get
started so white base coat using my
all-time favorite white color Club
French tip the link is below I got it
from live lip polish and after I do that
I put on one of my favorite liquid latex
barriers simply peel to protect my skin
from the messy gradients Brady and
monsters are everywhere so you can find
out more about this liquid latex magical
potion by clicking that little corner
link thing and watch my video if you
haven't already heard me speak for 16
minutes
you really should it's really a good
time I promise I picked these three
bright colors I got from Live Love
polish because they are awesome and I
know that the gradient doesn't really
make sense in like a rainbow fashion
where you might do like pink and then
purple and then fitting to blue because
like that makes sense with color logic
but I don't really care
because you know I just thought it
looked prettier this way okay we can all
be different it's fine
dab dab dab with a makeup sponge then I
peel off my simply peel and yeah almost
perfect I mean like I can't always be
perfect with my peels every time so
every now and then I do get a little bit
of Polish up in my cuticle so I tend to
just take a toothpick and gently push it
out and then I'll use an angled eyeliner
brush with acetone later okay I'm not
the poster child today for gradients
with no mess give me a break
quick try top coat because we're gonna
put on some nail vinyls next let it dry
approximately 50 minutes or so so before
we move on to the Neva as i want to show
you this part of the many that I did
that I hated that I changed later
I'm accent now I kind of thought it I
wanted the reverse of what I ended up
doing I thought that that would be cool
you know just till I have something
different and yeah so I painted this and
then I tried to make the lines thick
like the striping tape with and it's
just like wasn't yeah it just wasn't
doing it for me I don't know so never
mind and I took it off and I started
over
shit happens okay back to the middle
nail I took some stripes nail vinyls
from twinkle tea and you can use my code
simply for 10% off do it do it use my
code by all the Navajos let's see how
many people will buy just because I said
go buy them so I like these nail vinyls
because they're thicker than striping
tape and I wanted to make more of the
gradient to actually show so I found
this random black sparkly polish it's
NARS Nightcrawler and I think I've had
it for like eight years I don't even
know it's why the cap is really
disgusting but it's so pretty like wow
like it's black and it's like a galaxy
so I just thought you know it was time I
meana try something other than hollow
because this is not hollow because
there's no rainbows if you don't know
what hollow is then we can't be friends
so I just painted on over the nail
vinyls do not let it dry and then take a
pair of tweezers and peel up one nail
vinyl at a time starting with the ones
that you put on the top of the other
ones you know what I mean like I can't
use words today there you go look how
cool that looks badass yeah so you can
see I switched my accent nail back to
the rest of the mani I showed you this
in my last video but let's show it again
so I just cut the edge of the polish
soaked sponge off and then I have a
fresh new sponge to use next time okay
look at all my sponges they're so pretty
hey this little sponge went to the
market this little sponge came to okay
I'm sorry I haven't slept very much
today add a final top coat and you're
done make sure to leave a comment below
if you actually want to see a video on
that Nessie daughter cure fishtail color
blind eye test mani because I made the
video so I might as well show it because
that's like a complete waste of my time
anyways thanks for watching and then she
says yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
