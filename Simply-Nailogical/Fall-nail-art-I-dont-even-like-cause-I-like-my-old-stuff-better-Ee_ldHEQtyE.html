perfect for the fall season
except I don't like them at all and I'll
tell you why they may have gold hollow
glitter and that's pretty much the only
thing saving them from boredom but the
pattern itself is kind of meh I mean
look at these other plot nails I did
when I was a fetus even though the
lighting is terrible in the hand pose
makes me want to throw up the pattern
itself looks pretty good same goes for
these ones but that's probably because I
still live head from Burberry even this
pattern looks better but again I guess I
stole it from a coach scarf oh my god
can we just take a second and die over
how wrinkly my hands look I think I've
gotten younger since then actually I
mostly credit the nail oil I use daily
for my skin rejuvenation if you will I
put a link down below in the video
description box to my favorite nail oils
that actually appear to save your hands
- that's an interesting color palette
choice primary colors for the wind oh
look another coach plaid inspired nails
I'm so 12 yes well it's true that my
nails and photo-taking skills have
greatly improved since then for whatever
reason my plaid design skills haven't oh
well let's do this anyways because you
guys want a video I start off with a
burgundy base coat of an OPI color from
the Gwen Stefani collection but I forgot
to photograph and put in the picture
lineup of nail polishes oops
applying dark highly pigmented colors
such as this one is a life threatening
experience
is you got to be on your game girl make
sure that you do not flood your cuticles
don't paint too close to the cuticle and
you should be safe for any tiny mishaps
where you want to even out that line I
use one of my many cleanup brushes from
twinkle tea nice and smooth there we go
I look like a professional all of a
sudden add a quick dry top coat and let
it dry because we're gonna add nail
vinyls oh my god simply no logical you
are so predictable I have some highly
versatile straight up striped nail
vinyls from twinkle tea which you can
grab for 10% off with my code simply oh
look there's a mention here I'm
basically just creating guidelines on
both sides so I can paint a stripe that
has straight lines because I can't do
that without these it's just like
bowling okay my balls always go in the
gutter so I need me some gutter guards
now bow down to my blessed a England
magical beauties or they have come down
from the elusive castle to be painted on
my nails this is Tristan which was
incidentally named after the maker of a
England's cat obviously I had to buy it
because a cat was involved fill her up
right between the lines and you've got
yourself a holographic ocean one of the
reasons I love a England Hallows is
because they have this very deep
holographic appearance like projecting
on to you from the deep ends of the
universe peel it off and you got a
straight line yeah I'm going to cut up
my striped nail vinyls so I can not use
as many of them going forward because we
all know I can't paint
and so I gotta use nail vinyls to guide
when I'm trying to do here gonna paint
some perpendicular lines using a
England's Briarwood oh wow I love this
it's like the most beautiful rich a
Belgian back and do my god oh I love it
having technical difficulties tell me is
for you guys though cuz it's like a
smallest section on my nail I have to
paint ever I also spot another mini hair
these a England hollows are also
basically one coders it's a beautiful I
love them so much
okay so this is one of those times where
I tell you not to do something but I do
it anyways don't stick nail vinyls on
top of nail polish then it hasn't had a
quick dry top coat put over it cuz it
will probably lift it up but if you like
to live dangerously like me and trying
to save time making this video the skin
so freakin long then try it at your own
risk
I did try and do stick apply the nail
vinyl a bit by dabbing it on my skin
first oh yes hey England's st. George or
one of my favorite teal dark hollows to
slap that on real good men she is
jumping behind me peel it off really
carefully and make sure you don't peel
it up okay
we did it guys oh my god
mirakl don't try this at home things may
not go so well I pick a little excess
off first with a toothpick and then
clean up the rest with a twinkle tea
cleanup brush dipped in acetone how'd
that get there you get off the bag they
can clean up brush now I'm going to add
some weight acrylic paint stripes to
this plaid mess because I thought well
it really needs some contrast otherwise
you can't tell what's going on I use
acrylic paint because it's easier to
paint with and control and obviously as
I'm a cheater
steady you be steady girl I don't want
to have to bring the toothpick out on
you oh I'm so bad at this I can't even
draw one line and one go I have to do it
and like multiple attempts so the line
is never perfectly straight alright add
another quick dry top coat because we're
going to add more nail vinyls on top of
this and I really don't want to risk
picking it up again you can only live
dangerously so many times in your life
before you die
all right so what I'm trying to do is
add stripes of gold but the reason why
I'm putting a line as on is because I
want to sponge on the gold and not get
the gold on the other parts the nil that
aren't supposed to have the gold
christine you make so much sense today
with your words whoo what's that on my
other hand it's a pretty lilac Hollow
oh yeah that's color clubs cloud9 you
can find it at the link below in the
video description box with a whole bunch
of other hollows like this one fun
lacquers million-dollar dream fiance
ain't got nothing on this oh yeah rich
gold follow good or come out at the
bottle and taking now let's see that
again
all you swim so good let's travel deep
inside a bottle see where the gold came
from whoa whoa changing focus getting
really hot with all this changing focus
thing going on you know it's making my
mind go to crazy places oh my heart is
racing okay that's enough I got it work
take some liquid gold and dab it on the
edge of a sponge just a skinny little
tip part of it because you're gonna
slide that down in the middle of the
line guide thingies you have to be
really careful when you're doing this or
else you're going to accidentally sponge
over the edges of the guide line so
maybe I should recommend putting tape on
the side so that you don't do that but I
was too lazy so I took the hard risky
way because I'm a badass you don't
really have to use a sponge here you
could just paint it on but I find using
a sponge helps soak up the excess jelly
and leaves more glitters behind so it's
like maximum glitter yeah scale up the
vinyls to reveal the golden lines who
cares about the yellow brick road when
you gotta go
some of the glitters were trying to
protrude the lines I created pesky
little glitters so I just kind of shove
them over to the side with a magical
metal tool thing I don't know the name I
accidentally left a little spot in
between the white so I just use it to
pick and put that there like never hat
now let's add some more gold glitter
lines going the other direction Oh using
a sponge here is way too risky I
definitely do not recommend this in fact
I shouldn't even be showing you this
footage but then my videos would be like
all other nail art tutorials where you
watch the video and then you're like I
didn't actually see how you did that I'm
just going to use a regular brush to
paint it on because I'm too scared all
right that looks good
I'm sick of using stupid tiny vinyls so
let's just put it on with a toothpick
whatever my nails are so curved you can
clearly see the side - anyways add your
final glossy top coat what's that like
number three number four I can't count
all right there you go you got some
mediocre looking flat nails on your
hands the gold saves it but the pattern
is still kind of black the moral of the
story here kids is that even if your
nail and hand photography skills improve
sometimes your skills and foreseeability
of what the design looks like just don't
now here's to hoping that my next video
is actually a bad design that you want
to bother trying to recreate on your
nails
now go jump in some leaves or something
see you next time bye
