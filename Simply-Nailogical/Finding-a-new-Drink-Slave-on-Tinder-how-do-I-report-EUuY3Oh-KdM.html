because I don't want to be mean well
hallo everyone its maker seen again and
you'll be happy to find out that my hair
is doing quite well after last week's
experimentations was simply hair logical
unfortunately I can't say the same for
other aspects of my life
it's time for a life update you may have
noticed that Ben hasn't been bringing me
tea as much anymore did we break up no
but we've just been really stressed and
really busy and ultimately I haven't
been getting as much tea as I would like
all you want is a treat and all I want
is tea we are so much alike anyway so
some of my single friends have told me
about this thing called tinder
it's like kinder but I'm still waiting
for my surprise and I'm hoping that on
this tinder I might be able to find some
qualified people to bring me Starbucks
hashtag not sponsored hashtag just
addicted all right let's do this shall
we
tinder simply go and get it yet 17-plus
good I'm 29 now I have to admit that I'm
a tinder virgin
I have never downloaded tinder I've
never swiped right I don't really know
what that means I just hear it as an
expression in fact the only swiping I do
is wiping up to shock the link that the
beauty gurus told me to buy to make up
roster oh goody we done open login with
Facebook what did facebook hijacked
tinder to allows the app and website to
share information about you know I just
want a drink slave and privacy please my
first name is Christine with no age your
age will be public the little teenage
boys will know I'm too old to be on this
app my best pic is oh I know there it is
allow tender to access your location is
this like an after stocking people I
want to be notified when the understand
does that mean he likes me how does this
app even work what if I swipe down I'm
not ready to meet people yet where's my
profile show me

add more pictures perfect let's just
Google myself and find some pictures

never done this before
are you someone who

so good that's quite all right
I prefer it that way just the tea please
my legs search for people I need to
search by qualifications this is not
meeting my needs
why can't I see like a map of all of the
options this how is it a match so
quickly like do these people sit on
their phones new matches 99 likes 99
people already like you why why did I
keep trying to sell you some shit I'm
kind of curious if I'm gonna find
someone that I know one here it's like
dad is that you who's this guy and why

unlocked rewind YouTube rewind what
you've unlocked a super light yes oh
look we got a lot of messages from dogs

you studying
I'm studying tea leaves I have access to
teeth that could potentially rock your
world
who is this Norman person 7 foot tall
Instagram model bad boy Oh sounds like a
douchebag alright oh but he rescues dogs
with learning disabilities in a spare
time it's almost like you do think that
do not seem like such a douchebag
good do you like tea this is getting so
exhausting like retyping things and
having conversations for 20 different
people I think I'm gonna have to resort
to copying a base I mean a pick-up line
that I can use on everyone hello there
are you someone who can get me the tea
select up copy that
hey look at the mo more money mo
problems so did you get me the tea I'm
really good oh my god this is disgusting
this is what people do on this app how
do I report report report boring where's
your mother okay now where was that I
was copying and pasting two people
innocently looking for someone who could
bring me tea and that's all I don't want
any funny business okay just a grande
classic try tea latte with almond milk
from Starbucks
can you handle my order I got to keep
going back to check my messages this is
so hard to manage so many people on the
goal all at once Norman says it goes by
muskoka chai oh my god did he say Josh
it's like sitting in a gazebo next to
the lake at a cottage but in a cup oh
that all sounds great but do you live
close to a stove Alec says low if that's
what you want I could probably swing
back that's all I want Alex
God that's it seems easy enough I know
right
are you a grande or of a D if you were a
teen what kind of tea would you be I
think that's a really good screener
question how do you feel about almond
milk I believe I have the urban foraging
skills necessary to procure you the de
you dug like an academic I like it have
you ever been employed as a Starbucks
barista let's go have tea then no no
that's not how it works I need you to
bring me 50 are you asking me out
what No ooh I'm simply asking for you to
be my drink sing what don't you
understand it oh these people are
useless why is it so hard to find a
goddamn tea match it's called tinder
with the tea another alec says we are
talking about the kind that you make
with hot water right I'm just checking I
don't know if T is now slang for some
kind of weird drug no that's hollow
learn something new every day you'll
have to come and get it goodbye Ryan
just tea nothing else yes nothing else
god damn it I think Ben's home I mean
it's quick how do i how do you delete
your neck nothing don't worry about it
is that my tea would you come join me I
really need you right now erupted are we
having some problems

you break me up with me on camera
oh you be my only drink place you need
to give me a little bit of context here
well should we tell em I went on tinder
okay it was awful oh shit there's a
female well I gotta check that maybe you
invite her over in the three of us have
a good time get your own dinner as much
fun as this was I think it's time to
delete my gender and gasps please let us
know the reason you are leaving I have
had a poor experience on dinner because
you're the only drink slave I need and
you're so special to me that I made you
wait this one's mine hold on I got you
your shrieks hey babe look it's even
colored like a Da Vinci latte oh yeah
boy
do you wear your drink slave on your
body you gotta hand out these uniforms
to perspective drinks list none of them
deserve it honestly who wants a shirt
you can grab yours now at the link down
below in the video description box and
100% of the proceeds will go directly to
Ben's fun for getting it deep I'm just
trying to support you bitch oh we're
going to support you don't take your
drink slaves for granted because you
don't know if they're gonna be around
friends speaking of what else is not
gonna be around forever
it's these shirts and buddies because
this new band it's women in addition
sorry we couldn't afford to make this a
a long-term thing okay so you can get it
for yourself or you can get it for your
own personal drink slaves and then they
should definitely tweet bad on Twitter
so they can relate to each other about
what it's like to be someone else's
