so remember when last week I was
bitching about this ugly mani that I did
that I hated enough that I redid it and
it this way instead yeah well I listen
to the people because I love you all and
I made this tutorial anyways cuz you all
said you wanted to see so even though I
consider this fishtail color blind test
looking really confusing like drunk dot
a cure on my nails to be kind of like a
fail just because like it doesn't really
look that good I'm making a video
anyways just for you guys just so you
can get a laugh out of how dumb it looks
as always I start with a white base coat
I use color club french tip from live
love polish and get it at the link below
I add a quick dry top coat because we're
going to add some tape next let it dry
for 50 minutes and then I just use some
rolls of striping tape I think I have
like 1800 of these rolls and you can
pick them up from twinkled tee and you
can use my code simply for 10% off but
you can also find them on eBay Amazon
and the black market probably I don't
know if you've worked with these
striping tape rolls you know that they
are a bitch to work with so I just cut
off little pieces before I begin and I
stick them on the top of a nail polish
back I'm starting to make the fishtail
design outline basically so I'm just
adding them kind of like in a staggered
fashion and it looks like a braid some
people call this herringbone I think it
just looks like silver and hollow so I'm
not really thinking about what to call
this right now because look at them look
at them dance look at my fingers dance
with how those dreads like spiders
sparkly spiders so I realized though
that having these long sparkly hollow
spiders on your fingers can actually
like stick into the polish on the nail
beside it so I just trimmed them down so
that doesn't happen I use dotting tools
that I got from live lub polish in a
models own nail art hitch that has a
whole bunch of other stuff but let's
just talk about the dotting tools so
they have a round metal ball head and
there's two sides see there's actually
four different sizes of balls for all
your different ball size needs I just
dip it on the Polish brush and start
dabbing away and refill
when you need to so I started with this
color green because I thought it was
like
and then I'm going next with purple for
the look I thought I was going for
doesn't matter if you hit the striping
tape in fact it's probably better if you
overlap the striping tape because the
goal of this data cure official idea
idea I say I do was to cover all the
white space showing except for the
fishtail part so keep dotting away with
your next color this is some color club
I figure what it's called but it's
pretty I'm adding a punch of orange
because I thought that would look cool
and I think at this point I was using
the smaller ball on one of the dotting
posts just to give it some variation
keep filling in those white spaces and
then there was just a few spaces left of
white that I thought needed some other
colors other than the orange so I just
kind of switched around between the
colors and nature all the white spaces
were covered grab some tweezers and peel
off the striping tape one by one
starting with the ones that you laid
down last and now you'd think that the
Polish would be like super dry by now
because like it looks dry if you
actually look at it and that the
striping tape would like peel off all
weird and get messy but that didn't
happen for some like Voodoo reason I
don't know I guess I was having a good
day on the peel off tape part of the
many but obviously a bad day on the idea
execution part so at this point my mind
was just confused from staring at all
these dots so I just covered in a glossy
top coat and thought well that was fun
look if I move my hand around really
fast it's like a super I test for old
people and that's that if you think this
many looks fabulous then you should
probably get your eyes checked thanks
