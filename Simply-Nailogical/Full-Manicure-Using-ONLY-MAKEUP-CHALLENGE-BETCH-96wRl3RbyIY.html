hallo everyone my name is Christine and
you usually know me as simply now
logical but recently I did some simply
face logical and put some shit on my
face ok took a picture go check her
shirt cook which you guys loved so I
thought well what if I put the shit on
my face on my nails yeah sounds like a
great idea to me before we get started
have you checked out my new second
channel simply not logical yet we just
uploaded a new video doing the hundred
layers challenge but this time it was
with my boyfriend Ben gum and it didn't
go so well I would like to thank Liz of
Polish to Liz for suggesting this Manny
with makeup challenge to me it's time we
defy conventional norms of beauty and
put that makeup on our fingernails soul
face challenge with kids makeup or
highlighters or liquid lipsticks ain't
got nothing on this bitch alright so to
start out we're gonna need a really good
primer as a base coat I'm using this
stuff to take the oily look out of my
nails and then you're gonna want to let
that soak in for a couple minutes
unfortunately this clown cream makeup
was the only white makeup that I owned
but you got to make do with what you
have right ladies and gentlemen just
apply the white base to your nails I
mean you could really go with any color
but I like to start off with a clean
bright white canvas if you're using the
shitty cheap stuff like I am then you're
probably gonna need two coats to make it
fully opaque beautiful next I'm gonna go
in with some dark purple matte liquid
lipstick because it's the only color of
liquid lipstick that I have that isn't
red and then you're just gonna gently
line the tip of the nail what's called
the smile line hey it's like a smile on
your lips it's like lining your lips
it's really the same thing
unfortunately the white creamy should
underneath doesn't dry too well and so I
needed a couple coats of purple because
it kept blending in and making it
lighter purple we don't want that so
next we're gonna make the white part
really wet by adding a little bit more
of white because we're gonna
put some glitter on it yeah I got this
iridescent snowflake like beautiful
eyeshadow shimmering shit and I'm just
gonna use an eyeshadow applicator to
pick it up and dab it right onto the
nail dab dab dab glitter and shine will
make you fat keep on dabbing that
glitter train until the white part of
your nail is fully covered in fairy dust
next you're gonna grab your favorite red
liquid lipstick I'm using this one from
funny graveyard girl cuz she's my slob
Queen and you're just gonna take a tiny
little liner brush and make what's like
a very pointy red dagger object down the
middle of your nail next you're gonna
take some pink makeup that will last
forever and dab it on to the red because
I really wanted these to be pink spikes
but I just don't own any pink liquid
lipsticks the struggle is real
now we're gonna line this bitch okay we
got a ladder I'm just taking some black
liquid eyeliner and lining around the
French tip of my nail except it's
bleeding into the white snow god damn it
this is what happens when a dog pees in
the snow find that red spike too to give
it more definition cuz why is it not and
now it's time for some hollow yeah and I
wish makeup came in actual hollow like
this box is presenting itself to be but
this is the best I got so we're using
this lips which iridescent unicorn oil
bullshit
oh this looks familiar doesn't it if you
saw simply face logicals
Oil Spill lip tutorial then you will
have learned this amazing technique that
I'm showing you right now yeah bitch and
now while this looks absolutely amazing
it's time to turn things up and glow the
fuck up it's time to highlight and
contour my friends I'm just gonna go in
with some light highlighter cream down
the center of my fingers and then we're
gonna add some darker contour creamer on
the sides of the fingers because you
don't want your fingers looking like no
sausages do ya
that would be a note then you're just
gonna go in with your overpriced beauty
blender and blend that in is it blending
or is it dabbing or is it both life
questions I will leave you with and now
there's no such thing as highlighting
and contouring without highlighting but
first what's on my other hands what is
this what is this weird thing it looks
like is it is nail polish that's not
makeup who even thought in the first
place that painting the clear things
that grow to your fingers and letting it
dry and sit there with a good idea who
came up with this shit I want to know
and now it's that time where I realize I
bought the wrong foundation to match my
skin tone so we're just gonna go in with
some more lighter highlighter type color
in the middle of my fingers when that
bitch and beautiful
now where were we Oh highlighter yes how
could I forget you're just gonna go in
and dust that shit down the middle of
your sausages and oh oh girl and you
know I don't do no tutorial without
going all out that's right it's time to
glam the fuck out of my fit and nails
hand out of my hand we're gonna take
these beautiful iris Beauty lashes and
then we're gonna cut them up because we
got to fit them to size you know how
important that is
grab some eyelash glue put it on your
mini lashes oops that was too much and
we're gonna stick those pieces of
eyelashes right on just below the nail
to really make the nail pop you don't
want to tick away from the nail you just
want to make it pop okay and they're
beautiful your fingernails are now
snatched like your face if you guys want
a tutorial on this look just let me know
in the comments down below don't forget
to give this video a big thumbs up
because we're trying to get it to two
likes I honestly think this is the best
look to come since my polish mountain
and even the lipstick mountains that
came after that so if you want to join
in and you want to out makeup me don't
forget to hashtag menu with makeup so I
can see and so everyone else can see and
