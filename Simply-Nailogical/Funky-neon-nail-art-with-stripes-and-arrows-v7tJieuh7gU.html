talk in my nail art video switch I don't
really know why cuz personally when I
watch nail art tutorials and people are
talking it's really annoying and I kind
of just want to tell them to shut up and
just show me the nail art already so in
my ugly pink I mean pretty pink leopard
nails I did not too long ago included a
little bit on choosing the right white
nail polish so I'll just show you guys
again so you know how a lot of white
nail polish is really milky yeah
this is what you don't want you want
creamy nice white nail polish like this
one on the right the easiest way to find
this nail polish without searching
through hundreds of different companies
for the perfect white nail polish is
just to buy a french tip nail polish and
what that means is that there's certain
companies who make nail polish meant for
the French tip manicures and they're
really thick I don't know why nail
polish companies didn't think of this
before
just take your friendship nail polish
and call it white nail polish to cover
your entire nail not just the tip the
problem with french tip nail polish is
that the brush is often really thin
which is the case with color club
aurélie and a couple others so all i
did was just switch the brush and there
you go you have a white opaque french
tip nail polish but with a thicker
regular brush so we're going to start
with the bleach neon striped bass I'm
using a yogurt lid container as my nail
polish palette so I can get it really
messy now don't really care what happens
see yogurt was good for something so I
just apply a little bit of each color
one at a time so it doesn't dry out too
fast on my yogurt lid and take a thin
striping brush I got this one from
winstonia store link below and start
with one color at a time from the
outside of the nail working your way
across to the other side of the nail in
between colors I clean my nail art brush
by dipping it in a little bit of acetone
swirl it around and then I wipe off the
excess with a paper towel this isn't
really a proper way to clean your brush
and you're supposed to like use water
and so
or care about them or something but I
don't really care because I don't have
time so I'm just going to wipe it
acetone and go
and you're done put a nice juicy top
coat on top of it all and then let it
dry and go pay your cat with your other
hand that you're not painting or if you
don't pay your cat because you don't
want their hair in your nails everyone
and it's all dry and for me it takes 15
minutes but it depends on the topcoat
that you use take your nail vinyls and
stick them on and what I usually do when
I want a pattern where they're equally
spaced is I pick up a whole bunch of
them I applied them all on the nail and
then I take every other one off the nail
and keep adding to the end I don't
really know how to explain this with
words again talking in a nail art video
kind of useless right here is an example
but whatever just watch what I'm doing
and I took some straight nail vinyls to
give me that clean edge on the side of
these arrow chevron thingies and paint
it with black and quickly peel off the
nail vinyls well the Polish is still wet
if you wait till it dries then your
nails will look hideous trust me before
jumping to your topcoat you should
probably wait 15 minutes because the
second you apply top coat over a freshly
painted black it's going to smear
everywhere and then you'll have to do it
all over again and you're going to hate
me for not warning you but I just warned
you so you won't have to hate me and
there you go you've got some really cool
summer crazy nails on your fingers well
I hope you guys enjoyed this video but
more importantly appreciated me talking
in this video as per your request I mean
really though we could have gotten
through this tutorial in like a quarter
of the time if I wasn't talking and
being annoying but for some reason you
guys like me being annoying
so I mean comment below if you want me
to continue being annoying while talking
and I might just listen to you thanks
for watching
and listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
