YouTube looking for glow in the dark or
black light nail polish tutorials and
what did I find a bunch of DIYs of
course I'm sure they're all great so I
went to the Internet and yes my
suspicions were confirmed you're not
really supposed to put that glow stick
stuff on your body no you're not
thankfully there's nail polish companies
who know a lot more than the random
person does about what's okay to put on
your nails what's not okay I'm not gonna
get too much into the science of it I
don't wanna bore you to death now do I I
don't know about you but I don't really
trust a lot of those DIYs and personally
I refuse to risk my nails with that
anyone remember this thread banger
Corinne vs. pin episode yeah now Polish
companies who make it for your nails on
the other hand that I think I can trust
and so coming directly from someone
who's made over two 200 oh my god Wow
I've made over 200 youtube videos about
nails I have no life and my
professionally unprofessional opinion if
you want your nails to glow you should
buy a nail polish designed to do that
and not make it yourself but you can
apply the nail polish yourself and does
that satisfy your itch for DIY
so I picked up these four different
glowing products three of them are
colored nail polishes we got yellow pink
and aqua blue and this one is actually a
topcoat what I put the links to all down
below so you can find out where to buy
glowing if you want to glow - first
up I put a peel-off base coat on because
I'm in the testing phase this is simply
an illogical slab after all let's try
this pink one it looks like pepto-bismol
and regular lighting not gonna lie not
my favourite shade and it's definitely
not the most flattering on me cuz these
strange little dots in it weird is that
like the granular stuff that makes it
glow in the dark I really don't know how
to do science things work
anyways let's test it I can't see
anything this is going great so far I
can see you with a black light though so
that's good I think that I think this
polish is supposed to be going the dark
and not just black light activated if
you didn't know these purple looking
indigo bulbs are black lights if you
happen to be interested because you want
to have a late night Friday night glow
party with your nails and yourself I put
some links as to where I got these
blacklight products on Amazon down below
in the video description box wait a
second why is my pink holo glowing this
is the Twilight Zone have I entered
another dimension that's this polish I
had no idea that some hollows could glow
under a blacklight but hey what can I
say hollows do magical things in any
case I tried adjusting the settings of
my camera with this pink glow in the
dark polish and it did actually glow in
the dark without the black light but yet
it was kind of faint now let's play with
glowing top coat oh wow oh my kaha
what this top coat shines brighter than
your future yo this is awesome you
can barely tell that there's pink
underneath but who cares because look
how bright that glows that's insane
under regular lighting it looks like a
top coat it's clear you know
see anything funky going on but as soon
as you turn on a little bit of black
light BAM you see that glow girl you see
it good how about some late night rave
peel horn for you it doesn't feel the
best when it still kinda wet
next let's try this blue one this polish
is actually a lot nicer and it goes on
pretty smooth and I think you could
definitely wear this by itself without
any weird lumpiness or whatever that
 was okay let's out pull yeah that's
a gorgeous glowing blue by the way this
is a picture polish collaboration shade
with oh my gosh polish she is huge on
Instagram and you can also check out her
YouTube channel she does a lot of
glowing mani so if you like to watch
these on screen definitely go check out
her channel just to clarify this polish
is only black light activated and it
does not glow in the dark let's put some
glowing top coat over it cuz why not
oh I love this now I'm just gonna
put it on everything it's like a hallow
top coat get your glowing taco tio get
your glowing tacos this last polish is
apparently a true glow-in-the-dark
polish meaning it should be lit up with
blacklight and just in the pure
blackness darkness let's add a third
coat yeah this looks good looks good to
me
blacklight absolute darkness blacklight
absolute darkness
it definitely glows in either setting so
you can wear this to glow-in-the-dark
mini heading or to a Batcave your choice
and I'm just gonna add a topcoat of this
glowing stuff because I basically can't
stop now I'm radioactive don't with
me
yo so this is cool and complete darkness
it goes back to just looking like
glow-in-the-dark and again under normal
lights or sunlight or date
it just looks like a regular topcoat
there is no difference now let's have
some fun kids yes science is fun I put a
bunch of different things on my nails
we got a multi chrome some flakies over
black Paulo and just pure white creme
polish under black light
none of them are special of course
except the fleas are kind of shining now
let's add the magic top coat to all them
and see what happens
over holo it does nothing sadly it makes
me so sad
whoa when you put it over flakies you
can see the flakies under it that's
actually pretty cool don't flood your
cuticle though hmm
reminds me about one time I used gel
polish I got it in my cuticles I don't
know if that's gonna make this
experiment better or worse and I don't
know why I thought this would be cool
but putting it over multi Chrome doesn't
really do anything so there we have it
definitely putting it over pure white
yields the most glowing nails ever
outside you need to be careful when you
use this because it will show all your
cuticle mistakes here's what it looks
like with blacklight and normal lighting
still pretty cool
and with no backlight whatsoever it just
looks like how it looked before I put
the magical top coat on also this top
coat dries hard as a rock like wet I
think it's pretty much the exact same
formula as the regular quick dried top
coat that I use just with added glowing
 now we gonna peel it off and yeah
it's not peeling off in one big shell
because I was really impatient and I
only peeled it off like I don't know 5
10 minutes after I initially painted
this on and I got to do you know I
got nail art to do speaking of nail art
I hope you guys enjoyed this glowing
nail tutorial video because in my next
video I'm going to show you how to do
some nail art with this crazy polish
