this Stamper today I'm gonna unwrap for
you one of the craziest things I've ever
seen in Stan phenomics or stamp
manometry can penology whatever pick
your discipline this massive giant
Stamper that's pretty much the same size
as my hand is called the mochi Stamper
or the mocha or mo sheer mochi I don't
know and you can get 10% off with my
code simply yay codes the Oliv codes it
has a plastic holder bottom and the pink
stuff is a semi squishy silicon stamp
yes Bish's dance feels so good to touch
I just love squishing things one
important thing to note before you start
stamping with this giant monster that
the squishy pink thing needs to be
sitting down flush in the plastic holder
I'm using a paper towel to push it down
because I don't want to put all that
french-fried grease all over the
Stanford another important thing before
you begin on your stamping adventures is
that you should wash and Prime the
Stamper head first first I rubbed it
with a little bit of water and dish soap
dried it off with the paper towel and
then it took a mr. Clean Magic Eraser
wetted a tiny bit and then scrub the top
of the Stamper
this helps buff the shine out of the
Stamper and you actually want there to
be no shine you want it to look a little
bit matched that way it'll pick up the
image a bit easier you can also use a
lint roller assuming it's not covered in
cat hair to give a final clean sweep to
your Stamper to make sure there's no
tiny little hairs before priming after
priming shiny not shiny add good just
for fun let's compare this giant cur to
other types of stampers my big pink
Stamper could eat this little pink
Stamper probably eight times and this
green guy he just can't compete in the
length Department against my giant
Stamper now what the hell do we stamp
with this giant Stamper that's a great
question how but I show you I got this
endless supply of stamping plates
that'll probably never be advanced
enough to use also from bundle monster
they sell like a million different
it's ridiculous see how some of them are
the perfect fit for the mochi Stamper
you could in theory stamp this entire
extra-large plate in one stamp if you
want it to and if you were really good
of course you're gonna need stamping
polish here's a rainbow of them they are
all neon and super opaque but let me
just change the lighting so I can
actually show you that there he on
because my camera doesn't like to show
you that they're neon alright we got
everything we need let's begin start off
with a peel off base coat because we
want to be able to peel this shit off
when we're done because who doesn't love
the peel porn except I forgot to record
me peeling it off I'm sorry no peel born
today I decided to try one of the bundle
monster stamping polishes as a regular
nail polish because why the hell not I
love breaking rules stamping polishes
probably do not self level and apply as
nicely as regular polish so there is
that to consider just out of curiosity I
decided to paint my nail with the bundle
monster black stamping polish too but it
dried so weird what is this it looks
like tar so I learned my lesson and I
just covered it with regular black nail
polish next we're gonna take some simply
peel and apply it around our nails and
no we're not stamping quite yet
there's still one more step before that
because I just love doing simple nail
arts that are very straightforward and
easy to follow we're gonna do some dry
brushing dry brushing because who
doesn't love to paint like a
two-year-old now it's time to use your
amazing freehand skills and paint a
masterpiece this is my
now add some more colors to give it some
variety and depth and real meaning I'm
not just an artist okay I'm a graffiti
artist let's add some pang everybody
loves pang now peel off simply peel like
no big deal and leave that artistic mess
behind I've decided I'm gonna go with
this pretty damn cool graffiti inspired
plate from bondo monster it was created
in collaboration with Madame luff you
may know her from Instagram go follow
her
thanks to my last stamping adventures I
have learned that we need to remove the
blue film from the stamping plate in
order for it to work just wiping it down
with a little bit of acetone and let's
get to painting and scraping yeah I'm in
a rainbow mood so I'm gonna make a
rainbow stamp because I can or maybe I
can't we'll see if you scrape it a
couple times back and forth it will help
blend the color so it looks more like a
gradient stamp I press the giant Moche
stanford over top of the plate and yeah
um what did I do wrong let's try it
again I like to show you guys all of my
fails so you can see what not to do
because I think that that really helps
in the learning process just for
experimental purposes I decided to bring
the stamping plate to the Stamper so the
opposite of what I just did and see if
that worked it did not it did not work
at all and if at first you don't succeed
you can clean it off and try again you
can clean it off and try again try again
and again this time I'm going to try
rolling the Stamper from one edge of the
plate to the other as opposed to last
time where I just pressed the Stamper
flat down in one push on the plate and
hey looks like rolling it work I did it
again to see if I could replicate that
success and to prove it wasn't just a
fluke rolled the mentee Stamper over the
stamping plate did I just say men gee
yes I did and bam it actually worked
again so this is the fun part where you
get to stick your fingers on the squishy
Stamper it's probably best to use a
rolling motion if your nails are quite
curved - like mine remember you got to
work quickly with this part you can't
waste any time
or else the polish will dry on the
Stamper and then it won't stick to your
nail this one did not turn out so well
good thing no one ever looks at my thumb
I was surprised there really wasn't much
of a mess to clean up
and the polish that was left over on my
skin all I had to do was take a dry
brush and kind of push it off so now I'm
gonna do some black polish stamping over
top of my amazing dry brush graffiti and
I'm really just repeating the same
process as before except it's less
exciting because it's black and not
rainbow one reason why I think this
giant Stamper is pretty cool is that you
can do all your nails at once if you
wanted to because personally I really
hate cleaning off the stamping plate
with acetone like 17 times perfect I've
always wanted a tattoo of a nail polish
bottle on my finger to take off the
tattoo all you got to do is use some
double-sided tape or just regular tape I
realize that you don't need to apply
simply peel when you do the stamping
because for whatever reason the stamping
polish just comes off this easy like
this like what is this
you are defying the laws of nail polish
you can finish off the little stamping
stragglers with a cleanup brush dipped
in acetone if you like and now we're
going to add a hollow taco because I am
bored
that's what recently I found myself to
be obsessed with this particular hollow
topcoat because the hollows are
dispersed so you can still see the
polish underneath I got it off Amazon
and I put the link to this one down
below
ooh pretty hollow on street art hey
remember when I wrote the word hollow as
Street arts
I apologize and that concludes my random
ass colorful graffiti look please don't
