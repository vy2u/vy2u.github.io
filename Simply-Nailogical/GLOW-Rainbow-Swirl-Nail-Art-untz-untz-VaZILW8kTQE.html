week and a half ago when I post up this
get glow nails video I told you I would
be doing glow nail art next yeah well my
nail broke and we had a funeral
sometimes tragedies just ruin everything
I also promised you a giveaway for a
fitting 1 million homosexuals on YouTube
and that will actually beeps next video
bye bro I really liked playing with
these glowing nail polishes so I made
two different nail art looks for you
let's get started for the first one I'm
applying a white nail polish as the base
and yes my camera settings are still
terrible because I'd optimize them for
the glowing part not the part with light
in it on my ring finger I'm going to
paint on a hollow multi chrome because
why not
next I'm going to add this black light
activated glowing quick dried top coat
to my white nail and then just a regular
quick dry top coat to my green hollow
nail because we're gonna add now vinyls
next oh my god it's been so long since I
said that oh my god nail vinyls glow
well I don't even want to use them I
just want to look at them under the
light basically what I'm doing is using
nail vinyls to create some negative
space between glowing polish and not
going polish you can find nail vinyls at
one of my favorite shops to get now
vinyls I put a link below they have over
like 200 different designs what like
it's crazy and before it dries let's
just quickly paint some hollow mold to
come over that because I'm addicted I
can't stop with home fYI this lighting
sucks for hollow though so just ignore
that now this is the fun part of nail
vinyls you get to peel them off while
the polish is still wet don't wait for
it to dry or else it'll look like
movie buddy like a cyclone
she can do it all night long whatever
that how that a song went yeah I'm old
okay all right turn the lights off yes
and the black lights on oh yeah that's
right I forgot to mention that was a
black light activated quick tried top
coat so right now I have one two three
black lights glowing right now now on my
ring finger I'm gonna apply a mermaid
nail vinyl and paint the glowing black
light top coat on top of that wow this
is so cool to do enterplak lights I'm
never using real lighting again I got to
work quickly because these quick dried
top coats dry quick say that 10 times
fast peel it off and bam you're a
mermaid that got poisoned in a
radioactive spill I think the coolest
part about this black light activated
topcoat is that it's invisible you can't
see it under normal lighting so with
that logic you could paint on secret
messages that will only be revealed when
you turn on the backlight I just figured
out how you can cheat on your history
test you're welcome
there's no rule against black lights in
exam rooms right right right I've seen a
lot of polishes that glow under a
blacklight but I've never seen a glossy
quick dry top coat that's clear that
also glows under black light I'm pretty
sure this is the first time I've ever
heard of one I put the link down below
for you guys because as per usual I
often use polishes that are hard to find
you can only get them online
note to self the blacklight topcoat
shows up best when painted over a
regular white polish that's why for my
nails appear brighter than the mermaid
one alright let's do some more this is
so much fun this time let's cheat at
water marbling cuz that's one of my
favorite pastimes and I'm gonna use one
of my nail art mats I put a link below
for that too
so I can play around with some drag
marble designs look it's a water marble
without water
I actually already did a design exactly
like that in another video so let's try
something different
yay for trying new things Christine I'm
gonna try this spiral design which I
remember first seeing on Instagram by an
account called lack vid pretty sure
Sveta Sanders also did one I love these
drag marble designs so much I started
posting them all on my future account if
you didn't know I feature a lot of other
videos that aren't mine on my Instagram
account simply not logical because some
bitch took simply me illogical and if
you make Instagram nail art videos you
can hashtag your stuff with simply not
logical and I might see it and post it I
just love sharing other people's work
because it makes me happy when they can
do things that I can't can't water
marbles alright so after a shitload of
dragging and experimenting to try and
get the exact design I wanted I've got a
beautiful array of options to use and
not enough nails to put them on oh look
some of them even glow in the dark
oh yeah that's right I forgot to mention
I was using a bunch of other glowing
colored polishes if you watched my intro
to glow nails and you could see all the
polishes on their own once the polishes
100% completely dry and I mean it
actually has to be dry her else's will
fail I'm gonna gently use some kind of
sharp flat tool to scrape it up from
underneath and pull it up and slowly
don't break it don't break it oh it left
a stain interesting it's the stain of
the unicorn babies to adhere what is
essentially a sticker or a decal or a
Duke cow whatever pronunciation you
prefer to your nail first you're going
to apply some clear nail polish or a
quick dry top coat to make your nail wet
and sticky use some kind of tool to push
it all down on your nail and take a
slightly sharp metal tool preferably not
a scalpel we don't want murder here
gently cut around the edges like Grey's
Anatomy if the edges look a little
savage like this don't worry we're gonna
fix that soon use some tiny Russian
scissors if you like to cut off the
excess around the sides do some more
tailored trimming and then you're going
to take a cleanup brush dip it in 100%
acetone for it to work best don't load
it up too much you don't want to flood
your nail with it just enough so it
helps melt the sides of the nail polish
sticker and now it's time to party yeah
rave raving is so much fun I have been
to so many of them I socialize with so
many people all the time uh yeah yeah
yeah how cool are my nails though they
are so cool right I think I like these
better than the vinyl ones because they
include so many different colors and if
I ever actually did go to a rave people
would ask where I got my nails done okay
I guess we should add a final glossy top
coat just to seal it all in so it
doesn't start peeling off I'm just using
a regular clear one so it doesn't affect
the glowing Ness of the polishes
underneath guess it's not completely
necessary but it does give a nice glossy
shine and regular lighting and it helps
seal everything in so it doesn't chip
these colors are kind of barfy in normal
lighting though I don't really like it
this looks like I'm gonna have to carry
my blacklight around alright guys I hope
you enjoyed these two different nail art
looks using glowing polishes thanks so
much for watching and stay tuned for the
big massive hallo giveaway in the next
video coming up and I'll see y'all later
