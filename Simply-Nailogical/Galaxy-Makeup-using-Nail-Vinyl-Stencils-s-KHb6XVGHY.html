here's my dance in the space damn hello
everyone it's me Christine your favorite
beauty guru as you are well aware
because I cry about it in every video
it's growing out as you can see since
aya to my little remedy to try and save
my life but for now it's just too hard
to work with my new so we're going to do
our faces I love makeup makeup it's how
much - please lovelies will take over
truth be told I kind of missed her money
then I thought what could I do on my
face that I normally would do on my nail
which the canvas you know basically the
same thing and what do I have a lot of
fur now that's safe to put on your face
now vinyl
I always drop them everywhere now fine
sorry oh look at that look at that step
we're going to put them to good use so I
have seen this done on Instagram before
where I think makeup artist we're using
nail vinyl but maybe they weren't male
vinyls maybe they were makeup face
vinyls I don't know essentially you use
these little patterns as a stencil you
put them on your face and then put
powder and color on top and then
you peel it off and then you see the
shape how about we go with a galaxy rose
because I got a ton of star vinyls
and then some swirly and unicorn I
already have some base on my face
go to someone else's tutorial for that
so let's just get started with these
star vinyls put this right there
oh okay there we go I'm just giving you
the finger so you got to make sure that
press down real good and that you added
a glossy taco before no that's not how
this works Christine is kind of lifting
up a bit at the corners tonight I think
that's because my face is oily let's
take some squirrely whirly at low looks
like a little sperm me yeah buddy
oh it's cool I should just leave it like
this I know I can't smile it's gonna
make them come on thanks for that cake
add one of these stars on my eyeball I
know I can't blink
let's stop getting carried away with
putting all the line on the latex and
let's can put some powder over this
instead of using brushes sorry I'm going
to have to keep the sidecar using
brushes to put the powder on I'm going
to use these eyeshadow applicator have
you seen my makeup you've been doing a
wrong video I teach you many things
first I'm going to start off with this
matte purple stain my eyes last time I
used it so I'm going to use it again
instead of brushing it on you're just
going to dab it on if you brush it
you're probably going to pop off some
final and we don't want bad do what you
got to blend it without blending it you
know what I mean I already have this one
I'm popping off no next you're going to
take some navy blue pop that right here
maybe lose barely Navy it's too hot hot
pink put it down
why not it's so often but where did it
go okay well that reveal of kind of
underwhelming because I didn't get to
peel it oh yeah now we get some peeled
porn but wait the ultimate feel phone
yet oh my god yes oh not the best skill
set on my eyeballs but you know I've
moved so give me a break because
continue doing whatever you would
normally do on your eye makeup to make
it look good I went a little bit
different on this side because we had a
unicorn
I think I'm doing much better on this
one so far when you think cactus makes
perfect my beautiful friends whose we do
a little purple contour kinda looks like
a bruise doesn't it before I peel them
off let's put some of the Cirrus it's
powder everywhere you're add essence
shadows to get the dru galaxy effect
this is the most interesting contour
look I've ever done don't forget the
highlight to come here because was oh
not all right the big reveal left peel
we saved the best final to peel for left
look your eyelid ah oh yeah oh my god oh
I'm impressed with myself right now
trial number one child number two yeah
I'm starting to feel that beauty guru
confident feel good don't know what the
hell is going on down here but creative
expression okay
can't blend this part of my forehead
because I have a scar there because I
was an idiot child what else can I put
nail vinyls on my lip that's right I
have two giant canvas to work with
yeah sure well Dada Dada Dada Dada
shadows just could either look really
stupid we're really cool guess you'll
lose the first to find out oh yeah
there goes nothing let's just finish
that up shall we
I didn't the iridescent shadows over a
dark matte liquid lipstick Oh a school
has done that so those were white lips
15 now let's do some finishing touches
okay friends what do we think be honest
now attempt number one okay times number
two much better cap number three let's
just forget that ever happened to you
the mandatory narcissistic montage
say welcome to the Space Jam here's your
chance
do y'all dance here's my face please
will raise the space yeah so this is a
great look thirdly parent-teacher
conference hey girl
you wearing space pants because dad
asked Oh was out of this world I'm an
astronaut and my next mission is to
explore your rank you could catch me in
space how about that looks like I've got
punched in the mouth by an alien or
adopted aliens don't forget to head over
to my second channel simply not logical
where you're going to learn why this is
important I teach you many things I'm
not even being sarcastic you may
actually look let me know down in the
comments if you're going to use this
technique in your daily makeup routine I
