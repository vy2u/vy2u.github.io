looking nails for you not sure what to
call them but how about gradient
intricate diamond 3d cube pattern I
don't know I was 100% inspired by the
amazing Lucy of Lucy's - and I totally
stole her idea it's fine as a giving her
credit so it's not stealing
okay but obviously being me I had to
incorporate a gradient somehow to make
it even more complicated I start with a
white base coat and I've never said that
before and any of my video tutorials
it's color club's french tip and the
link is below then I'm going to smack on
some simply peel which is a liquid latex
barrier that I use to peel off the messy
gradient stuff and you can watch my
video if you haven't seen it already
which you better up cuz if you didn't
we're not friends what's the best peel
off stuff we'll show you what is the
best peel off stuff I'm applying to neon
--is-- coral orangish colors from lip
love polish
below to a makeup sponge that I'm going
to son John the nail and make a gradient
with now these two colors are actually
the only colors in this entire mani
because it's just black and white aside
from this and I know what you're
thinking we're simply now logical what
have you done there and you want to know
what I'm thinking you don't even know my
real name do you it's not simply no
logical it's Christine oh my god I had
one name so now I'm a peel off my simply
peel and she's given me a little bit of
trouble today she's not in the best of
moods but that's okay because I just
take a little toothpick and pick out
those tiny little pieces that get stuck
and then I take my new cleanup brush
from twinkle cheese which you can use my
coat simply to get 10% off and it's
awesome so far I haven't seen any stupid
little bristles fall off or pray or go
to the deathbed because of acetone when
you clean up around your nails with
acetone though your skin dries out and
turns white and it looks ugly for
pictures so we got to fix that so I just
take an empty pen of nail oil this is my
favorite kind bliss kiss and I use the
empty pen so it just gives off a tiny
little bit of oil not too much I'm
adding a quick try topcoat because we're
going to use nail vinyls next and then I
let it dry for about 15 to 20 minutes
hey look let's use some nail vinyls not
like I've ever used those before
so I peel off the Shepherd on skinny
nail vinyls I got from twinkle to calm
and use my coat for those two and place
it on the nail
and I'm actually going to be strategic
about this placement you'll see so I'm
placing the first one just smack in the
middle but when I put the second one
down I'm actually going to make the
points of the chevron zigzag things
touch so they're like make it out now
vinyls are making out so I'm just going
to continue that on both sides of the
nail so that it actually forms a bunch
of mini diamonds press the vinyls down
very firmly around the cuticle so you
can make sure it's secure and then on my
death I'm distracted by the hollow I'm
wearing
take my white polish again cover the
vinyls and quickly peel off the vinyls
the reason why the white polish is
looking a little stringy when I peel off
the vinyls is because I'm working under
a really hot lamp so tip don't work
under a really hot lamp if you don't
have to oh my god what's happening it's
the fear of peeling off your entire mani
with the nail vile don't worry it's only
because I'm using a peel-off base coat
that's right I use peel off base coat
under all my manis because I want to be
able to take them off really quickly and
change my nails every like two seconds
right so now comes the hard part of
using a striping brush and free-handing
the design yeah camera layout nail
vinyls for this part so I just take a
small striping brush dip it in black
acrylic paint and I'm just going along
outlining all the diamonds in black and
this is hard because as you name
remember I can't actually paint okay I
mostly rely on nail vinyls in the
gradients to distract you from the fact
that I can actually paint my tip to all
my fellow imposter painters up there is
to use a really long striping brush when
you use a longer brush it's a lot easier
to paint a straight line I don't really
know how to explain it's like the
physics of the longer brush versus a
shorter brush or something I don't know
come on who's a physicist who can help
me with this please leave a comment I
don't know why the next step is to fill
in the little zigzag things with a line
that kind of makes it look like a 3d box
I guess that's where Lucy stash got her
idea to call it a 3d cube mani but
obviously I had to be different and call
it intricate diamonds because that makes
so much more sense okay I'm super sick
of painting little lines aren't you
super sick of watching me time to add a
taco and finish this stuff I'm using
ESI's mad about you matte topcoat
because
thought it was kind of retro cool for it
to be Matt kind of like a 70s couch or
something out of Mad Men there you go
many intricate box gradient Chevron
diamond things and if I shake my hand
really fast it looks like kittens are
flying don't you see the kittens look
it's enough to collusion I see tiny
kittens flying on my nails well thanks
