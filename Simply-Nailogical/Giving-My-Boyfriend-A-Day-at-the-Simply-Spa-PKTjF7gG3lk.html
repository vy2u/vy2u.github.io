well hallo everyone it's me Christine
the sock again and today we're going to
have a spa day hold on a second
bye-bye I have a surprise for you
that was angry Ben why don't you come
over here we gotta have a talk
where's that Betty's yep you know what
Ben you do a lot for me yeah I was gonna
list all the ways but you bring me the
tea almost every single day you put your
face on a shirt so I couldn't exploit it
for profit
yeah where's my proceeds and most
importantly you injure perpetual
embarrassment by being with me I think
it's time and I do something nice for
you I'm gonna give you a day at the zoo
I saw this fabulous day at the spa
deluxe get set online and well I thought
you know I could test this shit out
myself and just you know have fun with
this child's toy but why would I want to
waste such an experience on myself when
I could do something nice for my
boyfriend you sure that's
age-appropriate
ages 8 to 98 it actually says that I
can't deny that I'm in that age range
shit here 99 sorry grandpa so sit back
relax relax
we're gonna have to make been
comfortable I know you're you're clearly
not comfortable we have this glamorous
robe I might have stolen from my hotel
I'm not sure this is like dust I'll make
sure it's secure with more than I'm an
accident this is gonna put my feet on my
own face yeah all right now I got Zozo
from from the Ouija board
where's those Oh hmm bozo and now we
need some nice relaxing music
let me know what you're gonna do in
folks but we're not securing anything
now before we get started on the
treatment I think you're gonna need some
teeth what if I leave well you're gonna
I'm gonna lock you in
does anyone remember when this was a
nail Channel what happened it's a bunch
of the daddies on the table people idea
like you know when I was younger I
thought I wanted to be like a writer or
like a public intellectual
now you move on my name it's clips of me
eating a cake with nail polish in it
you're asking up our cats when Christine
started this channel
it was clearly just a way of occupying
her time because she's always been
someone who just needs to always be
doing something you can never relax I
mean how many youtubers with almost 5
million subscribers are going into the
office in the morning to you know work
their desktop it's crazy I guess what
I'm trying to say is I need a vacation
I don't know if I'm gonna take Christine
with me maybe you weren't going back
Cheers
usually the rule is to not drink with
the customer but I make exception okay
well now that you've had oh my god now
that you've had a few sips of a beverage
banana man why do you like bananas so
much I don't like bananas so much go ten
boys we have specialty no-name chocolate
syrup what service I even think pant
your mouse alright let's jump right in
I'm good there's instructions how to
give someone spotting well I know let's
start with the foot bed
well I'm expected to blow up my own
footbath making the veins pop out in
Florida that's not good for beauty you
can weep at some nice hot water why is
it so clean your dirty dish we have we
always like to give we always like to
give our customers a little taste of
what's being used on their feet which
was that a little bit I'm sorry I bought
those socks last week they were really
expensive okay okay you're so picky how
about some tacky water oh when we were
in LA last year in Christine film 2
collaboration with Tati they asked if we
wanted anything to drink we go there go
get some water they open the fridge and
there's like 12 different kinds of fancy
water this is all you need to look like
or do you need those pills - okay
goodnight bye why would you blindfold a
client because it's better if you don't
know all right I think your feet are
sufficiently why are they red too big
for this cell using a face cloth - are
you flexing your toes so hard trying to
show off your toe flanks oh my god look
at that shit you could donate that skin
that's only loose cuz you stabbed it off
with me I don't think you're qualified
for some reason I thought like oh god
this is gonna be disgusting like
touching her feet but Christine
discovered a new king today I'm just
having the time of my lives dry dead
skin on my nails now I don't so it's not
a problem anymore
you're welcome oh I could really use
like a few more hours of work don't mind
I'm just gonna take a little break
now we can take these off throw them out
what kind of establishment is this we're
gonna have to charge you extra for
having next we're gonna do what all
beautiful people need what each other
says we're gonna have to fix this I will
try to fix you you gotta pull all your
hairs back to prepare the face first we
gotta shave it
if you open your mouth I will jump it's
not doing anything okay it's finally
working but this is like shaving a
carpet so are you just giving me a clean
shave are you leaving like a goatee or
something Oh open up
I got these little face Fraser's no this
is what jenna Marbles oh yes baby this
is like what they do in the barber shop
okay could you actually be careful like
you're pulling them out you're not
cutting them that may be better no like
a wax and they won't go back it's best I
can't believe this takes so long oh it's
you
I'm done with the shaving part of this
took me a neckbeard try to give me like
a rub rub okay perfect you're prepared
for the next trip this is the last
treatment right peace and tranquility
that's what you're looking at
cucumber wars true true while we wait
for the know while we wait for the
peel-off mask to dry

manicure you'd like I've had such a
great time here thank you shaken up way
too much of your time
give me your hands will you put on the
press onion again said I only got one no

face ready oh my god it's like I'm a
brand new first Wow you should have a
make me get up before and here's the
after all right Ben why don't you rate
the simply spa services like the shaving

offer that's the foot bath was okay
until my feet started changing color as
much as it seems like I hate these
experiences clearly there's something
that keeps me coming back for more
