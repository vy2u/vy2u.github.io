again so we all know about hollow
glitter nail polish right you can dab
that shit on and your nails look Sam but
have you ever tried just dunking your
nails and loose craft hollow glitter and
hoping to get a similar effect
you added a glossy taco but there was
still something about it that just
didn't look good it's kind of rough and
bumpy but most importantly it's not
reflecting all the beautiful rainbows as
much as it does in the jar of hollow
glitter well I've got the solution for
you I'm going to show you how to do this
instead of this that's right I'm
actually going to teach you something
this video wow it's a miracle it's
called the glitter burnishing technique
no not vanishing like with water marble
which is burnishing essentially you just
buffed the hollow glitter into the
surface of a khaki nail I'll get to that
part later and what happens is the
glitters end up flying flatter on the
nail as opposed to pointing in all
different directions flat pieces of
glitter make for a smoother nail surface
and the hollow tends to look better
because there's just a more visible
shift in the rainbow spectrum now I've
seen nails like this on some of the
professional nail salon accounts and I
was always wondering how the fuck they
got the glitter that smooth and then
about a year ago I watched angel from
twice stars video about this and I was
like holy shit litter burnishing no
kidding took me a while to make this
video but here I am now to share with
you how to get the most beautiful hollow
glittery effect at home let's start off
with some hollow glitter porn
look at all that color so hollow so I've
got three different brands of hollow
glitter I'm going to try for you today
and I put links to everything I'm using
in this video down below in the video
description box so be sure to check that
out if you want to see where I get my
shit I tried to only get hollow glitter
but sometimes it's hard to tell on
websites what's real hollow and what's
not you guys know the struggle but just
in case you're new here let me show you
straight up gold holographic glitter
versus plain gold no holographic glitter
gold hollow and rainbows boring ass
goals no rainbows silver hollow glitter
versus boring silver glitter green
hollow glitter versus iridescent green
glitter iridescent because it does have
a shift but it's not a hollow rainbow
shift pink iridescent glitter with a
green shift purple iridescent glitter
with a green shift and here's some blue
iridescent glitters and can you spot the
blue hollow yes yes there it is look at
the rainbow
magical fantastic you can varnish any
kind of small size glitter into your
nails it doesn't have to be hollow but
on this channel it has to be hollow okay
let's begin the biggest question is how
the hell do you burnish the glitters
onto your nail and get them to stick
I've painted a bunch of test nails in
black polish so we can experiment
together and figure out exactly how to
burnish just so we have a control nail
I'm just adding a regular glossy taco on
the nail to make it wet and then I'm
going to take a dunker with a fan brush
into the skull of good or oh so that is
funny
and where were we dump it on the wet now
and here we have again a chunky not so
linear hollow rainbow looking glitter
now it's okay but it's not great you
know what I'm saying you may just have
seen the busing technique used before
where people buff those fancy Chrome or
holo nail powders into a gel topcoat
that was just cured so let's try that
out and see what happens I applied a
glossy gel taco place - tint for a
minute and let's see if we can bust oh
yeah it's not really sticking everywhere
and this was immediately after I took it
out of the curing station so it's not
like I waited a while sticks to some
parts but not others and then when you
buff over top of it the glitters just
kind of fall off anyways so doesn't seem
that secure to me I tried the same thing
again using a silicon head tool which
you may see more often used in
professional nail videos but same thing
doesn't really want to stick to the
cured gel all right I tried let's move
on
what about sticking the glitter right on
to the wet polish I tried this just to
be able to show you that this isn't the
best option because you're going to end
up picking up some of the wet polish and
making a mess of the glitter let's try
this varnish and bond base coat which is
supposed to be for buffing the nail
powders into the nail it applies similar
to a gloss jaco but it feels much
heavier and thicker I waited about 1 to
2 minutes until it was tacky and then
buffed the hollow glitter in gently this
is definitely working better than the
rest so far but as I continued to buff I
could feel that even with a gentle
buffing motion it was moving the polish
underneath around kind of like poking at
jello for me that makes it really tricky
to work with because you could easily
press too hard and get all up
we just want hollowing on house we don't
want to fuck shit let's try something
else
what about a peel-off basis I've heard
that some people have been using these
to apply a nail powder so I wanted to
try it for glitter burnishing again I
waited about 1 to 2 minutes
and then started gently buffing the
glitter in it definitely worked and
appeared to cover all of the black
canvas below but when I compared it to
the other swatches it looks strangely
light in color
is it just me or did the pilaf basecoat
kind of dull the hollow and we can't
have that no we must continue our search
so last step I'm going to try the yellow
stopper base coat which in my opinion
does absolutely nothing to reduce or
reverse yellow nail it's literally just
a bluish tint in base coat that may give
the illusion of less yellow nails but
after about 1 to 2 minutes it's actually
quite tacky when it dries so it looks
like buffing in the hollow glitter works
pretty well with it I also found that it
didn't move around like jello under the
surface so I think I like the yellow
stopper base coat for glitter burnishing
and just for the sake of science let's
do another yellow stopper now and this
time burnish in the hollow glitter was
one of those fancy ass silicone tools
does it work any better hmm
it kind of looks the same to me but I
find it riskier to use these silicone
tools because they have a harder surface
and you could accidentally stab the wet
nail with the tip of it so my preference
is still the eye shadow applicator
because it makes it easier to go gentle
on the nail surface and it's a good
thing I have a fuckload of these and now
for the fun part all the colors of HA lo
I promise we're going to varnish my
actual nails in this video but first I
want to show you the range of all these
magical hollow glitters because look at
them
you can also burnish different sizes of
glitter in your nails too I would
consider these hollow glitters some of
the tiniest in size all the ones on this
nail swatch are from born pretty store
by the way which is very hidden mist in
my opinion but I tried out a bunch of
different teeny hollow glitters using
the yellow stopper with an eye shadow
applicator burnishing technique and I
think these look pretty damn off hey
what do you know this hot pink hollow
even looks exactly like the new hot pink
flash version of the hollow shirts we
just recently released you didn't know
we now have the hollow shirt in three
different colors of hollow yeh I put the
link for the shop down below your some
more colors of the teeny burnished
hollow glitters and by the way these are
all finished with a gel topcoat just to
seal them in and make them really shiny
I'll show you that in a bit
look at on the collar a little glitter
parn here's a random hack for you if
you're ever playing with more than one
glitter you can easily reuse the same
eyeshadow applicator by sticking it on
to a lint roller to clean off the
glitters Wow now let's take a look at a
slightly larger size of hollow glitter
these ones are all from twinkle tea I
put the link for them below and I used
the same kind of glitters in my hollow
glitter tears makeup look and in last
week's video where I did the glitter
burnishing technique on a fucking pigeon
spinner
who knew pigeon spinners could be so
beautiful because these glitters are a
bit bigger you do see more of the base
polish color underneath so if you're
using a larger glitter I would recommend
choosing a polish that's similar to the
color of the glitter to wear underneath
personally I like not the tea Gnaeus but
a slightly bigger hollow glitter because
they just sparkle more from a distance
like this fucking fidget I hate it but I
love it please someone help me use
hollow glitter swatches are so beautiful
that I feel like I could upload an
entire video just showing these swatches
in slow motion in an hour long repeat
video and look I did some nail art and
made of litter stripes now that looks
professional as shit please give this
video a thumbs up be proud of me last
step let's take a look at using slightly
bigger glitters to burnish oh my god
that is a tongue twister these ones are
all from solar color dust they sell a
couple different sizes so I have a bit
of an assortment here but most of them
are on a larger side at least as far as
eligibility for burnishing is concerned
again it's going to be a bit trickier to
cover all the spots on the nail with
bigger glitters but you could easily do
two coats I'll show you that in a bit
okay I don't know about you but I can't
take it anymore I want this shit on my
nail I'm just starting off with a peel
off base coat because there will
actually be peel porn at the end of this
video stay tuned hello sexual friends
again just make it easier to show you
guys how the glitters rub in I am using
a black polish at the base but you
definitely don't have to hollow glitters
are opaque and will still be the same
colour no matter what color of polish
you use underneath add a coat of yellow
stopper base coat make sure you get the
tips as well so you can stick
and after waiting about 1 to 2 minutes
it will be tacky to the touch a wait a
second we haven't talked about what's on
my other hand it's a beautiful combo of
multi chrome purpley pink polish with a
stunning holographic slate taco over top
I was wearing these nails in last week's
video but they are so fucking beautiful
that I wore them for at least a week oh
my god I want to live in this bottle ok
so where were we
now that the base coat is tacky we take
our eyeshadow applicator dip it in the
hollow glitter and gently burnish or
buff it into the nail I like to use a
dab and then rubbing motion to kind of
pack it on first and then gently rub it
in just move it and straighten out all
the glitters on the net I'm going to do
a vertical gradient with two different
colors to have a little fun again
packing it on and then gently rubbing it
in now you can keep going and bring the
two colors closer together towards the
center to make them blend into each
other and don't forget the tip when
you're happy with it you can easily dust
off all the glitter that fell onto your
skin with a fan brush and you should
also do this on your actual nail to get
rid of any glitters that didn't stick
properly so this looks pretty good
but two coats of hollow glitter will
make it look even better so I put on
another coat of yellow staffer waited
one to two minutes and repeated it all
over again dab and then rubbing in of
the hollow glitters make sure you cover
up all of the bare spots dust it off and
while we're at it I'll show you what I
did with the other nail I tried out some
different color combos although these
two teals turquoise hollows were so
close and Colour that you could barely
tell that I'd put two different colors
of hollow on the same nail on the
pointer nail I used some bright pink and
light pink hollow glitters and I think
just one turned out pretty cool when
you're all done you can use your finger
to Pat the glitters down on your nail
just to give it one last chance to
settle in and lay flat on your nail and
now to seal it all in we got to add a
nice thick coat of glossy Jack oh I'm
using gel topcoat here because I wanted
it to be super shiny but you can use any
kind of regular choco although I would
recommend using two coats if you use
regular glossy choco because the glitter
does eat the topcoat a bit look how it
looks under the gel lamp that's some
alien shit beautiful stunning now do you
see the vertical hollow rainbow gradient
I was going for it's for when you can't
decide what color hollow glitter you
want on your nail so you use them all
fYI I had used just the mid sized
glitters to do this nail art I listed
the exact shades of hollow youth in this
final look down below in the video
description box and that's it if you
don't think my nails look amazing then
you need to leave let me know down below
in the comments if you see yourself
actually trying this glitter burnishing
technique at home I would like to know
if my education is transferring to your
brain and now for what I promised you
some hollow glitter peel home girl it's
so extra satisfying when you cured it
with a gel taco it all just sticks
together and one big big glittery piece
oh my god I will keep you forever in my
pili bag necklace question and with that
I hope this video has satisfied your
hollow sexual needs thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
