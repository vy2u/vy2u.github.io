voice is a little raspy today that's
weird this is probably one of the
simplest nail art designs I've done in
my life
but I was bored so amid video pin for
you guys but look it's how a Polish look
at this beautiful mo purple toned linear
hallo guys they call this linear hollow
polish because it's a no I'm I don't
know in any case it shines like rainbows
but hits like that's all that's
important to me when it's a hollow yeah
put it on my nail who cares if your
nails are yellow you could hollow on
them and then they're not yellow anymore
it's like magic and now I say thank you
to all the hollow gods in the land for
giving me this polish to cover up my
yellow nails with and to shine no way
the haters dear haters lalalalala I
can't hear you cuz there's hollow in my
face look at these blues hollow glitters
no gasps seriously it got silver and
black yeah badass bitch right here I got
these from my favorite nail tool slash
supply store twinkle t-dot-com if like a
bajillion colors no I'm not even kidding
they literally have a bajillion
different options of
oh Claire and because I love you all so
much I got a special treat for you you
can use that code simply to get 10% off
all the holo glitters you buy or
anything else for the storage doesn't
really matter so you're gonna need a
clear polish not a topcoat why not a
topcoat
because the topcoat is thick and sticky
and it dries too fast and for this
exercise of placing glitters you won't
be that fastest therefore you need to be
using a clear non quick drying non
topcoat nail polish so I'm basically
doing this video to show you guys how to
do a glitter placement for beginners but
I'm not an expert either because you can
tell the way I'm aligning the hexagons
are really fully lined up are they no
they're not in any case all you do after
you swipe on your clear polish is you
take a toothpick you lick the end of it
to make it a little wet and then you
pick up each hollow glitter one by one
and stick it on the sticky part of your
nail that you just made sticky with the
clear nail polish and then all you got
to do from there is draw a couple shapes
or lines or whatever the hell you want
it could be a
disaster of glitter randomness rainbows
for all I care
in this case I just did some random
black and silver holo lines that kind of
look like sideways teeth seal it in with
the glossy taco sometimes it's best to
put two on so the glitters don't pull up
another important thing that beginners
doing glitter placements should know is
that the glitters you use need to be
solvent resistant that means that the
colors won't bleed when you apply top
coat these ones from Twinkle P are
definitely solvent resistant which means
they're good to use other ones from
sketchy suppliers such as eBay or Amazon
where you really never know where it
came from could be off the back of a
truck and Shannon for all you know may
not be as high quality and might bleed
when you apply a taco go with what you
trust people god bless america and there
you go that wasn't so bad was it
this didn't take me five hours unlike
this good replacement for three hours
unlike this good replacement probably
took me eighty 45 if you want to know
how to take this glitter stuff off your
nails easily you can watch my other
video on how to take good or stuff off
your nail easily
alright that's all I had for today guys
but here's some video of my challenge a
lot of you have been commenting that you
miss manche at the end of my videos i'm
so sorry that i replaced mangie with
nail porn okay guys like I needed a
fancy-looking
and too late don't you understand in any
case when I do talking videos in the
future I'll definitely try and pull her
up to the camera for you ok have a good
day bye yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
