users may already know is that Instagram
has been implementing a lot of changes
and is going to continue to implement
some more changes for better or worse I
guess I don't really know what the hell
they're doing but all I do know is that
I personally along with a bunch of other
people who have said so have seen a
pretty significant decrease in activity
whether it's likes on a photo or video
even video views that you can see now
and definitely a decrease in the rate of
growth of followers that's not helping
to unlock the giveaway so I need you
guys to help me please help me unlock
the giveaway by giving me a follow on
Instagram
you haven't already I really hate when
people always ask you to follow them
because it's so annoying
so curium being annoying thank you for
putting up with me let's continue I was
inspired by the cycle and emoji to do
these nails because it is so random I
mean really who thought of this emoji
but naturally I had to make it a
gradient and confusing because I've been
slacking on the typical simply no
logical nail art lately first we're
gonna start out with some creamy polish
I know it's not hollow don't worry we're
gonna add some hollow soon because to
mess this bottle up next we're gonna
apply some simply peel because everyone
wants to see me peel it off like no big
deal I'm using a linear blue hollow from
one of my new favorite brand of hollows
because they are so opaque the only bad
part is is they're often out of stock so
here's to helping they're in stock when
I post this video you can check out the
link below hate me if they're not and
I'm just sponging it on my nail in a
vertical gradient because that's the
kind of mood I was in even though it was
pretty much opaque in one coat of
sponging I like to do two coats of
sponging because then you get a nicer
blend down the middle and now we gonna
peel off simply peel like no big deal
except I miss some don't mind that oh
shit this is the worst kind of polish
you can get in your cuticles because it
is so pigmented hello this is your
cuticle speaking I am very angry with
you right now
next you're gonna add a quick dry top
coat cuz we're gonna add nail vinyls
next oh it feels like it's been so long
since I've said that oh how I've missed
you these are called easy cyclone nail
vinyls and you can find them at the link
below in the video description box and
the reason why they're called easy
cyclones is because they're easy to get
into bed no I'm just kidding you're sick
because the width of the spiral is
thicker they become a little bit easier
to peel than the original cyclones like
these ones I still really like the
original cyclone vinyls though because
you get a lot more loops if you
I mean there's also heart cyclone nail
vinyls that are shaped like hearts and
even kitty cat head shaped cyclone nail
vinyls did you know that I helped design
these all the different cyclone vinyls
are awesome but it just depends what
kind of look you're feeling and today
I'm feeling cyclone emoji and these ones
look most like that next I apply the
cyclone vinyl flat down on my nail by
this time the top coat is dry because
it's been like 20 minutes
oh what's that purple on my other hand
it's a beautiful indigo royal purple we
near holo and those out-of-place spots
everywhere yeah I did that on purpose
it's called the artist's look next we're
going to apply simply peel one more time
all around your cuticle to protect your
skin because we're going to do another
gradient now a lot of people ask me why
couldn't you just keep the simply peel
on from before and you could but I would
say that the nail polish from before
your previous sponging action would get
all dried up and crusty on top of the
simply peel and it would peel off a lot
harder when you eventually want to peel
it off here's an example from some
really old footage of a nail design I
did so long ago this was back before
simply peel existed but simply peel
liquid palisade or any product it
wouldn't matter if you peel it off when
the polish on top of it is dry it's
gonna look like this shit here's a
random rare look at my mind sometimes I
like to plan out my complicated
gradients on a mat or a piece of paper
first so I know how it's gonna look when
it all goes down
if the polish on your sponge is starting
to dry up it's best to just cut that
part off and get a nice fresh new sponge
love me some fresh cut sponges this time
we're gonna paint the colors on the
opposite direction although it really
doesn't matter because you could just
flip the sponge around Wow
magic and we're going to sponge the
colors on in the opposite direction that
they appear underneath the vinyl this is
what's called a reciprocal gradient
because it's like opposites
does anyone remember opposite day I used
to love wearing my pants backwards and
just keep doing the dab dab dab until
your gradient is fab then you're just
gonna start peeling everything off this
is the fun part I try and feel things
off in the order that's easiest it might
be the simply peel first and
I feel vinyl in this case that kind of
just came together oh oh no oh that was
close okay we're good it almost peeled
off my peel off base coat oh oh shadow
sure no no please I really don't want to
redo this
oh my god I just pulled that off that is
crazy
I should be in Ocean's eleven I don't
really know what I'm gonna do to fix
this out cuz it looks like a bunch of
bumpy weird shit but I am determined I
will never give up I have a major
love-hate relationship with my peel off
base coat I hate it when you do this to
me but I can't stop using you let's just
see if I can pad everything down and
pretend this never happened and I'll
move on and forgive you I think this may
have actually worked so I just added a
glossy top coat and no one will ever
know what happened
see I could have just not showed you
that entire part and just pretended it
was perfect all along could have done
that
all right emoji creators what do you
think of my new reinvented gradient
cyclone emoji I'm still waiting for
gradient nail art emojis and hollow ones
speaking of follow this mani feels like
it's missing something hmm
what could it be only a Hall of sexual
knows the truth
oh yeah it's a hollow table d'hÃ´te have
you seen my wets the best hollow topcoat
video yet you should definitely go watch
that if you want more info on all the
hollow top cuts in the land well just 11
of them it actually rated this one a bit
lower on the scale but I kind of changed
my mind too because for some cases like
this nail art I wanted the particles of
hollow to be dispersed so you can still
see the nail art underneath and I think
this one is perfect for that but I still
find myself needing to add two coats so
I can get a little bit more hollow
action there now these nails are perfect
now I can really hypnotize you into
subscribing to my channel if you haven't
already because there's hollow on my
nails near allosexual and before you go
it's healed porn time that's right I
just had a shower time to get naked no
need to be alarmed that my nails have
watermarks in them it's completely
normal because I just showered and
drenched my entire body in water
remember how I said I had a love-hate
relationship with peel off face cuts
yeah well this is why I love them and
why I can't stay away from them because
it's so fun to build things
and you can collect them and keep them
forever because a creeper I'm a creeper
you are all my victims alright guys
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
y'all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
