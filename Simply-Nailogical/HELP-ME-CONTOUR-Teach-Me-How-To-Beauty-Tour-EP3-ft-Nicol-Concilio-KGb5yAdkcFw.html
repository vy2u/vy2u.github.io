using a lot of cream and foundation and
contour cream I love so you guys have
pointed out more than once that I don't
know how to contour it is true that I
look like a dirty potato so I would call

her face is always what's the word they
use cut cut we're gonna go for the
challenge today which is cream contour
okay wet wet contouring okay powder if

putting my primer on this is know who
does that like spread it I thought it
was a technique for like wake up um so
what foundation do you have what
we'll just go with it so this is my
foundation stick not contour stick right
but they're the same they're just
different names just marketing yeah
pretty much
really okay so I don't I've been on a
lot girl so my I'm sure I'm gonna put on
a lot to come I got a you know Stephanie
I want a Beauty Blender what's wrong
with this what about a few minor
marbling oh my god it's a water marble
blender oh my god I hate it so I'm just
gonna start by just you know applying my
foundation it's so satisfying to is it
why should I just put this everywhere
well yeah I mean then I take my Beauty
Blender blendy blendy Wendy look at you
blend in you're doing great you're doing
great sweetie now I look less dead okay
I wouldn't say you were dead before but
you do look even I'm just dead inside my
gosh I hate to say you're not the tart
girl take not sponsored no no where's my
cotton I feel like I should put more on
I do this like a little triangle II kind
of thing upside down triangle thing on
the top there just to kind of highlight
I always wondered does that sound like
Illuminati thing in the beauty Club
everyone does triangles and I'm here
just like putting blobs
can I get a little bit on the Cupid's
bow too but then now I have no lips so
just going in with the beam under and
kind of doing a light hand do you use a
light hand to make yourself look fast
Sheena are you ready for the contours
yes for the contours I'm ready for the
contours would you like to use Fenty
Beauty RiRi guru go color oh my god that
is dog can I test it sure do you mind
okay so I'm gonna teach you baby steps
okay all right so here's the thing all
right so let's start with the forehead
first okay so usually when you want a
contour is like right here it's a
matchstick what if you light it on fire
I know I don't understand them so like
where my scar is character don't go
over it anymore
guys I just did my eyebrows what do you
think perfect
feel where your cheekbone is the hollows
of my cheek exactly just go like that
perfect stop go back and forth yeah
perfect
oh it does really burn see I told you
girl we - Wow
go for your forehead you want to blend
down but for you cheeks you want to
blend up like this that's why your
followers will say yeah
wait they've known this whole time
you're supposed to blend up and they
didn't tell me savages that's why they
want you to fail Christy show me how to
blend up so just kind of go
like this with it just blend up like
that yeah perfect and then okay wait a
second you're getting a little happy you
don't really want to wipe so like you
were like I was waiting right so we're
just gonna dab it a little bit just like
you're doing my nails are you doing a
gradient I'm doing a gradient so you
guys can see like it's a very subtle
contour but oh yeah girl will you do
that oh okay I would use something
that was more cool toned on you but
since I don't really have that like Kim
Kardashian
this is like cool and warm as well oh
that's the one what's like nothing in it
would you guide me wait now it's a day
now it's an a just be serious no I just
need to see the Sarge so do you want to
contour your nose yes I would like to
learn I think I am already know but I
don't like this so that's a highlight or
weird where do you feel like you want it
I mean I don't know you guys tell me
what's wrong with my house maybe we can
make it a little perfect yeah all right
you're just so much closer because my
nose is bigger and then I can just kind
of like square off the bottom like a
chipmunk exactly just kind of square it
off we're gonna do a line right here
perfect stop perfect oh I love this
drawing shapes in life you like it yeah
and then this summons the imagine yeah
it definitely needs blending at the deep
in all fairness I did give her a little
dark shade guys but I don't have a lot
of light that's ironic and all
fairness now I get it I think you're
ready to move on to the other side so
now we got to get the know I'm a little
bit concerned what's wrong up and down
like this okay not bad blend a little
more so now the only thing left to do is
just to kind of set the face
I have Laura Mercier yeah okay and then
do you have a fluffy brush on you this
fluffy and that is fluffy what do you
use that brush for my face okay she has
like slight powder in there just dunk
your brush in there set your whole face
of it so are you always good at makeup
no let me find a photo I feel like I
could pull one up for you I'll find some
you want we can add some powder what do
you mean I'd powder you mean oh I'd
powder contour yeah so wait you can do
cream contour and then put powder
contour on top let's do it let's do it
all I'll kind of brush your oh okay it
says contour tap off the excess that's
my favorite part
fill okay making music work in little
circular motions I'm touching my cheek
so lightly yeah perfect
beautiful that looks really pretty feel
like you're just done so you need a
brush that looks like this like your
eyeshadow this is what I have those a7
brushes in hand perfect bring it up a
little bit more yeah bring it up so this
is like giving yourself a nose job yeah
pretty much does a little harsh you kind
of blend it no no my god she's never
gonna make it
do you have a sand brush I have an air
conditioner cheese glue what about like
the button on the tip here okay
I'm so happy you asked that because I'm
gonna show you okay so I just take my
finger and I dip in tip just the tip
just the tip oh oh look at that
highlight it's so pretty so I thought I
didn't try this eyeshadow palette
are you part of it I love the hallo on
the packaging
I'm gonna watch simply face logicals
trick this I learned from Tati where you
get it in a crease yeah where you apply
it on your eyes you look like a bronze
