man nails are on fire and if it's not
too much trouble could you please bring
along some of those attractive
firefighters like the ones and all those
calendars you know girl you know what I
have on my nails today is a scaled
gradient which means two gradients
adjacent to each other one on top of the
other but the gradient is going in the
same direction therefore it's not a
reciprocal gradient about a year ago I
started this thing on my blog called a
gradient guide where I tried to make
sensible my madness and fabrication is
different gradients but it's kind of
outdated and no one likes to read blogs
anyways but you can go there if you're
looking for a definition
Early's my definition of different kinds
of gradients let's get started uh don't
you hate when people say that I'm
starting with my favorite white polish
as per usual and yes I know my nails are
a lot shorter that's because one of them
broke when I was trying to help build a
nail polish shelf as I broke a corner
off my nail trying to help I guess we
just shouldn't have tried to help at all
well I simply feel peel off stuff around
your nail as one of you put it simply
keel is the condom of nail art it's your
protection on girl shit's gone get messy
once your simply peel is dry after a
couple minutes take your makeup sponge
then slap on that red orange and yellow
nail polish make sure you focus the
middle of the gradient towards the
bottom of the nail
ended up doing two gradients one on the
bottom and one on the top yeah I'm just
saying words that don't make sense now
but as you watch the video connection
and it spins will next times and you
will need to listen anyways
add another code of those firing colors
these polishes were so opaque it only
took two coats take your tweezers and
peel off simply peel like no big deal
she was sweating up in here give that
condom a little kiss goodbye before you
throw it in the garbage apply a quick
dry top coat we're gonna put on nail
vinyls and if you don't apply a quick
dry top coat or you put on nail vinyls
and you're gonna peel up your entire
manicure and it'll look like yeah
fire nail vinyls there's actually a few
different styles of fire on the sheet I
got from 2050 you can find these at
wowt.com and you can use my code simply
to get 10% off if you use my code you're
a smoking hot individual stick the
vinyls on towards the middle bottom ish
of the nail and then apply some simply
seal around the edges for some more
protection and I just use a piece of
tape though too lazy to keep using
silicon whatever it is really matter
tape or something feel at the bottom
just mask off your area so you don't
make a mess take your sponge and cut off
the dried polish to get a fresh one so
that didn't work out so well did it how
your sponge again if there's still nail
polish in it there we go
fresh new sponge red orange yellow yay
fire colors also the colors of the Sun
and McDonald's are sponging dis gradient
on in the same direction as the gradient
underneath it so right at the bottom and
the yellow at the top apply a second
coat to build up opacity heal off the
simply peel the tape and the other side
of simply peel you got to take the nail
vinyl up upwards so the Polish doesn't
kind of drag the new layer from side to
side
it's getting hot in here so peel off all
your vinyl I am getting so hot I'm gonna
peel my vinyls off read a comment below
you even know what song I'm referring to
apply a nice tap code and look at that
your nails are literally on fire the
coolest nails ever oh my god what this
what is this color shifting chameleons
alien oh my god oh my it can't be
is it is it unicorn pea oh my god it is
it's the ultra elusive way too
overpriced clearance 230 cells on eBay
for a ridiculous amount of money no I
didn't buy this myself my boyfriend
bought it for me a year ago because he
wanted me to stop by nail polish and
thought that buy me the most expensive
one would mean I wouldn't need to buy
any other nail polish he was wrong
anyways I realized I had never used this
before and thought maybe it's time so
I'm like look at that Scott like
redshifting magic on it I should put it
over fire now look even more fiery and
that was very underwhelming I don't know
like it's just it's not doing it for me
you know I was expecting like magical
unicorns on fire screaming but there
just kind of looking at it kind of
turned the yellow dirty and it looks
okay on the red but I guess it would
look better on a darker color I should
probably do what you're supposed to do
with the scenic car key which is apply
it over black or another dark color or
just use four coats of it by itself
perfect and far easy coats as they say
right
in a case have you guys heard of unicorn
pee before do you even know what the
hell I'm talking about maybe it needs to
be its own video who wants to learn the
history of unicorn key please comment if
you want to know the history I happen to
know it very well but very well I mean I
just made it up in my head thanks for
watching and enjoy my new sexy nail porn
