again and if you live on the internet
like I do then you may have seen what
has been named the Diamond cappuccino
if you are low sexual you know that's
not diamonds okay
that's hollow hollow see Oh which is
short for holographic which is code for
magical shifting rainbows for at least
the past two weeks my twitter feed and
Instagram tags have been completely full
of this diamond cappuccino I don't even
drink coffee and I need this right now
now where the fuck do I order one okay
Starbucks are you there it looks like
what they've dubbed the diamond and gold
cappuccino are available at a coffee
shop named coffee by de Bella in Mumbai
India I personally have not seen any
other coffee company do this before and
I'm wondering why I didn't think of this
first I want the hollow in my tea please
so it looks like the only place you can
get this is in Mumbai but that's a
little far from me in Canada so before I
booked my flight to Mumbai I'm gonna try
to make myself and by making myself I
mean oh no no no I'll take a hollow
glitter cappuccino please okay so we got
to figure out how to make this this is
really important it's not really clear
what they're using to make it look like
hollow glitter and I haven't been able
to find an actual tutorial for this why
would there be a tutorial there not a
youtuber they're just companies selling
a drink yeah good point
I guess they wouldn't want to give away
their secrets but I'm gonna find their
secrets bitch
mange mange what are their secret in
order to figure out what the hell they
used we did a little digging the
director of coffee by de bellas says
that coffee lovers shouldn't be worried
about drinking their sparkly new
creation the glitter they use is made
from a combination of crystal sugar
mixed with edible food coloring that's
heated together to create a signature
shine
then I stopped their Instagram to see if
they spilled their secrets get it
spilled like coffee or tea a lot of
people were asking can you drink it is
this safe to drink and they were all
assuring them of yes you can drink it
and to one commenter they replied we
make our own glitter which is made by a
proprietary process from crystal sugar
but basically I gather that all we need
is crystal sugar right that's what it
sounds like god we got lots of different
colors of crystal sugar pre-made because
this bitch don't know how to make
anything in the kitchen it's very easy
to make your own colored sugar by the
way wait this is just sugar with food
coloring basically pretty much and as
far as we can tell crystal sugar does
not come in hollow or anything other
than one solid color the coffee company
was making two different glitter
cappuccinos one of them was the hollow
silver glitter and the other one was a
gold glitter which was not hollow which
honestly looks a lot like this to me so
I think first we're gonna try to make
the gold one using this just to see if
this sugar method works and then after
that we're gonna try something else to
get a real hollow cappuccino
so really big mugs - I Hank spilled milk
so it looks like when they start off
pouring there's a little bit of espresso
mixed with a tiny bit of milk already
and then kind of like a floating layer
of hollow glitter and then they pour it
and the glitter kind of floats up
accordingly
you wanna cadurci know it's ready okay
so first we pour a little bit of
espresso and just kind of sprinkle it on
top
show us your latte I would there it is
I don't know how the Fanny art could
have been made well you didn't even pour
it at the top did you even try yeah I
was going like this that's what they do
let's try this again and by let's I mean
you kid I got sick of it actually yeah
it's right you did were like the phony
stuff what if you like like this there's
a heart
just stuff it's trying to water my I
still can't do it
of course sugar is going to dissolve in
a cappuccino you should try it some kind
of has like the sheen or this look of
like gold leaf on the top layer more
like a shimmer or metallic sure I'm
thinking at nail-polish tears and you
could do this kind of sparkly or a
shimmery cappuccino with any color of
sugar there's this kind of silvery grey
one here that would be the closest to
the Diamond cappuccino but ultimately
none of the sugars or any food coloring
that we can find comes in holographic
but what some food brands or cake
decorator stores do have that is
actually holographic is something called
disco dust and I think that's just like
one of the brand names for a product but
it's basically food contact safe hollow
glitter so one of the articles that
talks about the coffee
literally links you to a website that
says if you want to try to make this
yourself you can buy edible glitters
here but it links to this website that
sells these disco dusts which are often
mischaracterized as edible when really
they are non-toxic or food
contact safe so your body is not
digesting them
decorations really is what they are my
first thought when I saw the diamond
cappuccino footage was that it was bit
stuff until I read them saying that it
was sugar and food coloring mix I've
actually seen this stuff before because
when I collabed with Yolanda from how to
cake it is that hollow and I asked her
if I could eat it no there's no such
thing what is for food not toxic but
it's not technically edible so in other
words you can use them to decorate your
cakes and shit but like don't eat a lot
of it and you ate a lot of it and that's
what I did it tastes like burning you
give me hollow and you tell me it's like
food contact safe I interpret as edible
people in the baking world are very
aware of these products it is supposed
to be for decorative use it's just not
toxic so it's not a huge deal if you do
consume it but it's not edible at the
end of the day I'm pretty sure they are
a polymer right there a plastic one
article on edible versus non-toxic
glitter says glitter intended for cake
design usually called disco dust does
not differ at all from the giant ten
ounce tub of made in China glitter you
can get at the craft section at Walmart
that's reissue what I'm not an expert we
are not experts on like cake ingredients
and shit so we can't say for sure so I
think we're all curious is if we were to
put this into a cappuccino does that
look like what the design of cappuccino
is hmm hey come on you get back to work
Oh could you get the milk and not spill
it everywhere
whoa a little bit goes a long way
oh my god that looks so good
that totally looks like it simply just
looks like hollow glitter on top of a
coffee
it's simply hollow glitter that's the
secret and it's not melting right
because it's you know plastic I mean I
guess at a certain point plastic
wouldn't melt if it was hot enough now
that it's a diamond
aka hollow cappuccino using a not
approved for consumption disk or does
glitter I think we should acknowledge
what everyone's probably thinking using
the non edible disco dust makes a drink
that looks very similar to the Diamond
cappuccino currently being sold unless
we're completely mistaken and these
actually edible sugar crystals exist in
the holographic shade or food coloring
or sugar on its own existing holographic
and please let me know because I have
not been able to find any of them and if
there was a food dye that made things
holographic the next 100 videos on this
channel I'll be about making different
food hollow right yeah like we want this
to be true it seems that it's either the
case that this random coffee company in
India invented or developed a
holographic way of dyeing sugar sugar or
they're just using a product that a lot
of people in the baking world are
already really familiar with that is
sort of dubious in terms of whether it's
safe for consumption or not where a lot
of people have kind of been confused
about whether it's something you should
learn on although they've replied in
Instagram comments that it's edible and
that it is a proprietary mix of sugar
and food coloring you don't know maybe
they do there is there something else I
have a mission for any hollow sexuals
out in Mumbai
go to a coffee buy develop but go
undercover don't tell them order this
Diamond cappuccino take a spoon
you're gonna extract the glitter use a
paper towel hold on this parts a little
messy what you trying to say I'm science
science thing if you have a strainer
that's great but if you don't you're
just gonna go like this and then inspect
it very closely and send me lots of
macro photos because if it looks like
this then maybe it's this but we don't
know for sure and we don't want to be
sued so we're not gonna come to that
conclusion do you want to separate I
kind of do you know I hate coffee
well clearly gonna die no but clearly
people can drink this we wouldn't be
seeing these you know bubbly stories
about this cool glittery coffee drink if
the people were drinking it and dying I
mean like I had it once and I'm fine
don't spill the hollow oh you got real
hollow lipstick beauty guru here's
another thing though doesn't dissolve in
your mouth it's plastic it's kind of
like eating safe and that just seems so
strange to me like you wouldn't you have
people drinking it noticing that it's
not like dissolving in your mouth but we
didn't find that many posts of people
like visiting and trying like it doesn't
seem like there's a lot of evidence of
people actually going and ordering even
though they said that they sold a
hundred thousand cups of it okay let's
try that again
you get the eye where's the art milks
not foamy enough what if we just cover
like the missing spots and more Halle
that is art this looks like a non edible
diamond cappuccino
registered trademark clearly we aren't
capable of doing latte art or any kind
of art like nail art but honestly the
best art of all is like full hollow so
I'm pretty happy with this if I drank
coffee this would be gone by now but you
wouldn't drink this because it's plastic
we could do something cool with these
like a rainbow pattern raucous please
woody yeah it is actually this is a
youth extra-large actually fits here you
and your kids can be pooled in Palo
style and where's yours it wouldn't fit
under your uniform that's okay I forgive
you disguise
feel like it would look better if you
just did it on top at the end like that
now that's the hot new cappuccino trend
mm-hmm a lot of sugar can I have like
just a very sweet lizard okay I'll see
you later Ben all right class so what
did we learn today
if I were told this were safe to consume
a lot of I would put it in my tea every
day I would like to put that shit on
everything and if I could make my tea
Hollow and actually drink it I would
definitely be giving you guys a tutorial
haha subscribe I'm sorry
so I think we may still need to book
that flight to Mumbai do you think they
tell us if they were just putting
plastic and coffee I don't think they
would legally tell us that hey if this
company has invented holographic edible
glitter then I would like to see proof
that's a million-dollar idea yeah you
should be selling that I will invest
immediately mass markets available to
everyone five percent real hollow sugar
instead of like a rock or whatever yeah
I'm gonna be off you want to play with
their Ouija board it's almost 3:00 a.m.
I'll hang out with Zozo in here what
about the baby
it's water marble you throw it out
actually I think it's still alive
okay Ben's gonna go for ten runs now and
I'm gonna go to sleep cuz I didn't drink
any this I'm wide awake
I see home now I've been like hard it's
in my cup okay alright guys thanks so
much for watching and we'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
