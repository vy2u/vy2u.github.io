spilled ho hello it's me sistene again I
mean simply face logical today recently
I've noticed an increase in videos in
the beauty community where people draw
on their tears and it makes me wonder
beauty community why are you so sad is
being that beautiful so depressing
so I decided today I want sadness on my
face too so we're going to do glitter
tears but not just any good or tears
although glitter tears I got so many
different colors of hollow glitter right
here in front of me I'm gonna have so
much fun
crying them out of my face I've already
put some base shit on my face that
you'll have to go to someone else's
channel for that and start off with some
brown and turn that from upside down it
literally tastes doing my face makeup
first eyeshadow always falls on my face
how do you prevent this beautiful people
ho hey I have a beauty hack for you if
you have really dry skin on your eyes
like I do every time you put eyeshadow
on it it just emphasizes your dry skin
just take a brush and you know kind of
trying to shave the dry skin off and yes
I did put moisturizer on my eyeballs
first yo genius but it doesn't change
how my eyeballs like to sleep I'll never
have skin like tacky now for the fun
panic I'll heirs bought this because I
thought Mickey you tutorials use it all
the time I see a beauty blogger use I
buy what beauty bloggers use I'm going
to start off with this purple ha
it's like a stamping plate I always
forget the fucking plastic on top all
right good it's all on my first order
I'm actually come to think of it maybe
this isn't such a big problem because
we're gonna cry down there pretty soon
our just one blend eyes evenly
ban ban thank you did you drink half of
it no not yet it's a long process yeah
mark gun I'll see you tomorrow thanks
for the tea this pink is not obtaining
as pink as I wanted to be but oh wait I
saw this video on this channel called
simply not logical and I learned about
the eyeshadow applicator hack that's
right we're going back to 1992 here oh
yes Pat that shit on look at that
pigment beauty bloggers have been lying
to us all these years on social media
because I just want to save all the
beautiful secrets for themselves
typically the gradient you guys know
what those are you watch my nail videos
No yeah I didn't think so thread these
days it's like I upload a nail or
tutorial and people say Christine you've
changed you just can't win off of insane
pink right in the eye that's it
stab yourself in the eye we want to cry
colors okay oh god what did I do
I don't think there's any fixing this
now let's put some shit under our eye
because that's where the tears are going
to go and now we draw in our own rooms
how cool would this be if I put like
blue and purple in my eyebrows is that a
good idea or is that a terrible idea
let's find out
oh my god I kind of don't hate it maybe
I should dye my hair purple and now time
to cry so now to get into the spirit of
crying you're going to concentrate on
all the money you spent buying makeup
products because a beauty guru told you
to and then when you tried them yourself
you could never make it look that good
struggle is real it also helps to decide
in advance what level of tear you're
going for you know you want a boyfriend
who dumped you before prom tears broke
your nail level tears that one's rough
youtuber crying about ad revenue tears
those are some waterworks or if you
think you're emotionally strong enough
finished watching 13 reasons why tears
oh boy oh boy I'm really just doing all
of these tears so wide and ridiculous to
cover up all the purple shirt that fell
on my fist earlier now I'm going in with
a purple frosty kind of highlight shade
and we're just going to highlight the
tears we want our sadness to glow the
world needs to know how sad we are
that's how you get the views you want to
be a youtuber you're going to crash all
the comments be like Oh Christina shame
60 face logical so shady here now I'm
just going to cover up the purple that
went on my nose because that was not
supposed to be part of the look now I'm
just going to take this clear I glue by
yo fee I've never heard that before when
you guys send me this to my PL box it
says hello makeup those a lot it usually
is so I'm gonna do a little dab these a
little eye shadow applicator to stick on
the hollow and she what are you getting
shit man that kind of works what I wanna
impress myself add some more glue let's
create a cascading hollow glitter
gradient because my too has changed
colors as they snow from the pain in my
eyes what do you think what do you think
big
hey shit hollow comin over eyes hollow
coming over wherever just whatever you
do don't put glitter in your actual
eyeball don't try this at home okay I'm
just killed professional here now
naturally your tears will well up and
concentrate themselves towards the inner
tear-duct so that's what we're trying to
go for here real natural tear look to
give it a more three-dimensional look
crease can add some bigger chunkier
pieces to Pat out wow this actually
looks kind of cool what happened I'm
feeling this it I'm feeling that bad all
right let's do the other eye stunning so
now I suppose we should put some fake
lashes on cuz I am just so bad at it and
I need practice I don't know how the
beautiful people do it stab themselves
with hair into the rivals it sounds so
simple but I can never get it right so
I'm going to trim them because they're
always too long for my tiny eyes I'll
shit what side you supposed to trim the
inner or the outer I never remember not
that I ever looked it up
wish me luck oh my god like what the
Saltman all concise am I not using good
glue what am I doing wrong I should go
on and teach me how to beauty to her
just like kidnap or for beauty gurus to
teach me all their secrets
I got dark pretty fast
okay that's the best we're gonna do how
does it look holoku ture kind of look
like a holographic vampire just call me
William
Pollock in the eyes note ten out of ten
would cry hollow glitter again tbh I'm
kind of living for this I want to die
for this look I mean no I'm living which
one is it
I mean I think honestly beauty gurus are
confused we should be concerned
sometimes they want to live for their
looks and sometimes they want to die and
cue the montage alright guys what do we
think this look it's great for Halloween
or just every day of your life if you're
a howl of sexual hello it's me out there
where any other day I would attempt to
hollow glitter placement on my lips like
that with artist Vlad ma but not today
