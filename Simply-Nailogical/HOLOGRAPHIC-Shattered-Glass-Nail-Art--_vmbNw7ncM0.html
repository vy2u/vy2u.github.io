still a little sick but look at all the
rainbows and the magical gloves flex on
my nails these holographic shattered
glass nails beat all the shattered glass
nails that have ever existed before this
I'm sorry - the girl in south korea who
first started the idea of using
cellophane on nails a shattered glass
because hollow just trumped you so first
you're going to need some iridescent
cellophane and I went to Michaels and
found both of these colors so obviously
I bought them both because I couldn't
decide I've seen a couple nail artists
already try this effect but most of them
used a thicker and more rigid type of
cellophane that will make it more
difficult to apply to your nail and it
won't last as long so you don't want
that don't get the packaging that says
iridescent tissue or cellophane tissue
or the one that looks like a pack of
flat unicorn worms because these are
both super thick what you won instead is
this very type of thin cellophane mine
were labeled transparent or iridescent
packaging wrap and I got this pretty
pinkish whitish one that shifts to
greens and blues and also the super
elegant badass red / maroon one that
also shifts to green and kind of goldish
yellow but wait what's on my other
handle I'm distracted by all things
shiny I can't help it this picture
polish Bordeaux by Neil
because we are drunk in love mail I
think you mean drunken love on hollow
nails but I'll let it go this time now
back to the magical cellophane I'm
pretty sure that if you peeled a unicorn
skin off this is what it would look like
don't get a sunburn charlie the people
are gonna peel your skin anyways I'm
doing all this on white and then black
fabric because I was really curious how
these different types of unicorn skins
react on different surfaces
you see they both have magical
properties that react differently so
just cut up your unicorn skin don't
worry they just shed it it's not harming
any actual unicorn into tiny little
asymmetrical imperfect pieces and you
can just kind of do this butcher
technique I learned where you just kind
of chop all around in the big pile to
get smaller pieces when you're feeling
lazy and if you don't want to pick up
tiny objects because they're so tiny so
much magic and this video so I'm
applying my favorite peel off base coat
because I really don't want to take
cellophane off the facet oh and I have
no idea how that's gonna go down and if
you were thinking about telling me how
ugly my yellow nails are you don't got
to worry about it because I got a
magical unicorn whose powers will turn
idiotic taters into a pile of hollow
glitter next I'm applying my new
favorite drugstore black which I just
discovered in my latest video because I
want the most badass holographic
shattered glass nails ever and we need
black to make that Hollow pop and now
it's experiment time it's time to do
experiments first let's see what the
different unicorn pili skin types look
like over black the red cellophane looks
greenish and kind of orange whoa let's
try the pink to green unicorn skin it's
also looking green but a little more
blue but I also forgot how to focus my
camera there we go
now we can see a clear difference
between the reds
Hanover black and the pink cellophane
bring me the hollows Dexter we must
bring the hollows into the lab I'm going
to test out to different Molotov coax
the one on the left is more dispersed
like the hollows are further apart from
each other and the one on the right is
more concentrated I mean the one on the
top now is more dispersed than the one
I'm going to put on the bottom is more
concentrated sting stop changing your
camera angles you're confusing your
audience oh my god I just discovered a
magic trick by putting holo over a
cellophane it makes it disappear holy

okay let's repeat the same experiment
but put the holo topcoats on the black
polish first and then put the cellophane
unicorn skin on top of that because you
got to explore all the possibilities you
got to cover all your grounds if you
want to be a good scientist so this is
weird even though it looks like I'm
randomly applying the pink in the red
cellophane all over the map I was
actually just applying the red on the
left-hand side and the pink on the
right-hand side maybe they were at a
slightly different angle on the camera I
don't know you know you can't explain
all the secrets in the world when
there's unicorns and Hollow involved but
oh my god magical secrets unlocked oh my
god are you seeing this turning purple
it's purple my god it's purple dear NASA
I have made the most amazing discovery
to date when you layer Unicorn skins
over hollow the true colors of the
universe are unlocked so obviously I
decided to go with the purple magical
unicorn witchcraft combination and I
decided to go with the more concentrated
of the two hollow top coats because why
not go all out girl you can find the
magical links for these magical
holographic top coats that I showed you
in this video in the magical description
box down below so after one generous
coat of my hollow top coat while it's
still West I pick up some shards of
unicorn skin with a toothpick one by one
I just picked them up
from the end of it to make it a little
wet and I decided to just place them
like randomly with no particular pattern
because that's the beauty of the
universe its randomness I guess for the
coolest effect try and place them close
to each other but not completely
touching because I kind of like to see
the hollow peeking through around the
sides of the glass if you know what I
need so sometimes it look purple and
sometimes it's just Hollow
magic everywhere all the time just make
sure not to push in or poke in with your
toothpick because then you'll mess up
the hollow topcoat below instead just
gently place the unicorn skins on the
wet Hollow and then you can kind of use
the side of the toothpick or your finger
to smooth it out and that's it really I
mean look we're almost done I don't have
much else to tell you you can cut the
unicorn skins to fit your nail around
the edges if you need to and most
importantly don't forget to seal this
black magic into your soul with a nice
generous coat of glossy top coat I'm
using this super shiny awesome one that
has a gel effect even though it's not
gel polish you can find that at the link
below as usual and kind of let that dry
for a little bit and mesmerize yourself
by staring at your nail for
approximately 20 minutes or 30 or 40 or
50 however long you can be entranced by
magic color for well no you only
actually need five or maybe ten minutes
to let the first coat of glossy top coat
dry because then you're going to add a
second glossy top coat this is very
important because you got to make sure
all those unicorn skins are sealed right
into your nails because I mean the
unicorns already lost their skin once
and they'd probably be really sad if you
lost their skin too bad there's so much
badass black magic extraterrestrial
unicorn witchcraft magic going on in my
nails right now I can't handle it I mean
look how it looks in different lights
look at that I'm you know looks like
stained glass all those magical colors
rainbow lasers are on my name
I am now invincible back off get your
own unicorn skin look what happens when
you shine only one light sideways on
your nails you got all these magical
colors popping out and in the dark oh my
god I am basically radioactive so one of
the concerns raised by other nail people
who tried shattered glass nails was that
the cellophane started killing up within
one day but not mine can because I chose
the right kind of unicorn skin you gotta
know your unicorn
I wore this manicure for 4 entire days
and that's with a peel off base coat
there was a bit of wear but this one was
totally my fault that I just ripped a
piece of cellophane off and I was bored
at work and a tiny bit of chipping on
the corners of my nail but that's partly
due to my nail being super curved and
susceptible to chipping especially when
I'm wearing a peel-off base coat I also
always make sure to seal the tip of my
manicures if that makes sense it helps
it stay on longer but overall my unicorn
skin nails stayed on just fine and then
I sadly filled the moths
with my favorite feel of base coat
because there has to come a time when
you have to part with the unicorn in
order to appreciate its eternal
majesticness I had just showered so I
think some soap or something got
underneath my nails and made some weird
concoction with the peel-off eight go
and my peel-off base coat faceoff videos
coming next week ahead get excited now I
know you're sad I took these off but
don't worry they are forever preserved
in history because look at this look at
this masterpiece
well alright now it's your turn to do
shattered glass nails but remember go
hollow or go home see you next time bye
