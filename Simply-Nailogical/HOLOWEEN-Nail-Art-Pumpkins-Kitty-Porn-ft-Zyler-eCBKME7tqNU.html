has in nail polish and I has no nail
polish
why does now she get all the love where
is my love that is it I command my own
nail polish I make it so Hollow it
invoke many existent she'll question a
copper hollow because I am second best
or third best whatever it matches my
coat of looks orange fur now you must
take my picture for Instagram
do you want to pet me do you want to get
hollow sexual with me well hello
everyone it's me christine again and
that's right i'm so happy to introduce
that my second cat Zeiler the one
everyone always forgets about has his
own nail polish now whoop
xyler the cat is a bright copper 100%
hollow glitter and it is available
exclusively online today I put the link
below in the video description box
here's a quick comparison for color
reference for you we got a gold hollow
glitter dialers copper hollow glitter
and men cheese baby pink hollow glitter
and you know what is either the cat is
the perfect polish for the fall season
and the Halloween season and that's why
today I'm going to make some bomb-ass
Hollow pumpkin heads on my nails
starting off with the peel off base coat
as per usual on my accent finger first
I'm going to apply one thin coat of
Zeiler the cat's Hollow and there's a
cat hair pet got stuck in the Polish
Zeiler next I'm putting on a cuticle
protector thing
these ones are latex free so if you have
a latex allergy you can use these
instead of the traditional liquid latex
I put a link down below for these neat
little bits aprons I don't know what are
we calling these again the idea is that
you cover your finger and protect it
from what we're going to do next which
is load up some Zeiler Hollow on a
makeup sponge let the sponge absorb a
lot of the clear part of the Polish
leaving a big glittery gongshow behind
what then you're just gonna dab dab dab
it right on the nail make that hollow
fab you know what I'm saying this is the
best way to apply glitter polish to get
it super opaque I've been doing this
since I was a fetus oh look at that
terrible filming quality and now you're
gonna peel it off and thank God that you
had some shit on your skin or else the
glitter would be particularly hard to
take off
next I'm applying something that isn't a
glossy taco I know what the it's a
product that's new to me and it claims
it leaves a super thick plush finish
it smoothes out mattifies and
essentially primes rough glitter nail
polishes like this one let's let it dry
and see how it works so the idea is that
it's supposed to dry matte you'll put a
glossy taco on later because it's a
thick formula it's supposed to have
filled up all the little spots in
between the thick pieces of glitter it
feels smooth it looks smooth I think it
kind of worked some people may not
notice but I think it works next we're
gonna use some of these two cat nail
vinyls that I helped design how to break
your anything place it firmly down on
the nail and paint in the cat head using
my most recently discovered favorite
black nail polish you can watch my other
video on that now I know sylars head
isn't black it's orange so this is kind
of the opposite of what I should have
done but I do whatever the fuck I want
okay leave me alone black cats make
sense for Halloween anyways okay so
we'll just go with that reasoning I
tried to make some eyes but then I made
them too big and then I decided the eyes
should be yellow and kind of glowing and
evil unfortunately I'm not the greatest
tiny freehand painter so I went back and
forth a few times trying to make the
eyes look perfectly evil next we're
gonna make these pumpkin heads and the
easiest way to do that because you all
know I love cheating is to use some nail
vinyls in the shape of a circle I've
stuck them on one of my nail art mats
and oh what's on my other hand it's the
same goddamn thing that was on my other
hand in last week's video if you would
like to slay with your nails watch this
video that just popped up in the corner
thingy and you'll know how to do this
now we're gonna fill in the little
circles with sadler the cat the makeup
sponge method is probably the best
method here there was really no point of
me painting it on first sponge all that
shit down and then peel off the vinyl
for a nice clean circular edge since
hollow glitter might get kind of brittle
and crack once we try to peel it up I
like to add a little bit of clear polish
just to make sure it all sticks together
so now we're going to let that dry and
move on to the rest of the nail starting
off with just one coat of my favorite
black polish it is so black I love it
and I'm gonna stick on another apron
thingy around my nail to protect my skin
because we're gonna do a quickie
gradient let's try some blue
lack lend them a little bit together so
I'm kind of feeling like I want to make
it look like a Halloween sky you know
dark and scary maybe a wild clown will
appear be careful kids you better leave
all you better run and leave all your
candy to me just to be safe
peel the apron off around your skin and
do any cleanup if you need to as you can
see I'm not really worrying about the
mishap at the base of my nail because
that's where we're gonna put the pumpkin
Hollow pumpkins what Cinderella should
have got in the first place just
applying a thin coat of clear polish to
make my nail a bit sticky and stick down
your Zeiler hollow circle press it
firmly into nail and we're gonna turn it
into a pumpkin kind of looks cool as is
like planet Mars now I'm going to take a
teeny tiny paintbrush and paint a teeny
tiny pumpkin stem and how about some
cute Tori Lea little leaves because I
don't know try and make this less evil
okay it's we got to think of the
children remember the fucking kids okay
let's go over those toilet it'll things
with some green paint and I think the
stem is supposed to be brown or dark
green or rotten or dried-up I don't know
oh now this pumpkin needs a face steady
hand Christine steady hand I'm trying to
paint a triangle better try harder huh I
won was slightly bigger but moving on
how about a mouse and now let's make
those weird buck teeth that traditional
pumpkin carvings usually have and
bippity Boppity fucking Boop there is a
hollow pumpkin brought to you by Zeiler
gonna steal it all in with a nice thick
coat of glossy taco
don't forget the kitty cat
right now what are you gonna be for
Halloween a cat no one is ever a cat for
Halloween you're so creative Tyler is
very proud right now he is very proud of
my nails he wanted you all to know this
if you're going out trick-or-treating
this Halloween season or if you're gonna
be out as an adult
just freaking drunk and havoc on the
streets make sure that people know it's
Halloween and wear your hollow nails
okay they'll look like this in the dark
with a little bit of light and that is
badass
people will know you're coming from a
mile away because your nails are awesome
if you want to grab sylars polish I put
the link down below and I really
appreciate it
we sent mentee to college but we didn't
send Zeiler yet cuz you know what he's a
smartass he doesn't even need it but we
do appreciate your support
