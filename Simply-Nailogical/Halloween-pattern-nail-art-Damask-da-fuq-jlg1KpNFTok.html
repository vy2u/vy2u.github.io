a trek one or the other get ready for a
slightly Unepic Halloween nail art
design I don't got no patience today so
let's get right to it you guys have
missed this white polish haven't you I'm
applying my favorite white polish on Max
and Bill because I felt like it being
different from my other nails don't ask
questions
but look orange howl oh my god guys look
at this it's called seductive marmalade
you know what you want to do to it can't
put it on your toast this warm rich
orange hollow induce sparkly polish is
perfect for Halloween but also for the
rest of foam because it reminds me of
pumpkins and fall foliage and other
things that you like to throw up in the
air you can find it at the link below in
the video description box and lucky for
you it's up on pre-order right now mmm
yay gimme some of that good orange
jell-o this is one thin coat followed by
a second somewhat generous coat the more
coats you put on the more opaque you
will be
and more hollows you'll see look at
multi hollow dimensionality add a quick
try top coat and let it dry because
we're going to put on some striping tape
next not really a necessary step but if
you're me then you sometimes do things
that are unnecessary
check out my hollow striping tape I hate
these stupid striping takes it takes me
like 20 minutes to find the stupid end
of this so cute
tape Oh finally do we go uh everything
is okay now guys hello makes everything
better
anyways I like to cut up a bunch of
pieces and put them on the top of a nail
polish bottle so I can easily take it
off Lulla hey England sleeping palaces
on my nails oh my god this is one of my
favorite rich purple hollows look at
that hollow so deep like the ocean you
can find a England holographic polishes
at the link below in the video
description box ok enough distraction
let's get going so you don't really need
to apply the striping tape down in this
kind of grid pattern I'm just putting it
on as a guideline to draw on my design
so it's evenly spaced take some black
acrylic paint because painting with
acrylic paint is a hell of a lot easier
than painting with black nail polish try
it and you'll see why I take one of my
new nail art brushes I got from twinkle
to look at them so pretty dip it in the
black and let's test my ability to paint
before I start painting my nails
yep not so great so my goal here is to
paint like damask damask DMS
I don't damask whatever design on my
nails so I Google it to get an idea of
what kind of pattern it is and the first
thing I noticed is that oh
all of these are extremely intricate how
am I going to paint this I don't know so
there's a lot of swirl thingies and I
kind of have these things that stick out
and make them look really elegant
oh to make this design more
Halloweeny I'm first going to start
painting out Halloween characters in the
middle of my supposedly damask design on
this now I've chosen to paint a little
bat because Batman is cool and I wish I
had a Batmobile to give him some eyes I
just take a toothpick and kind of pick
out his eyes yeah guys it's not animal
cruelty if it's a picture of something
on your nails okay don't worry
now I'm going to attempt painting
something spirally and fancy looking
like damask and I don't know okay oh my
god I really can't paint freehand
anything else can I I know you guys have
heard me say this before and you're
probably getting really annoyed like
Christine shut up we know you can't
paint but you're still good oh yeah look
I'm so good I don't know how to not
block the camera while I was painting
this obviously it was my intention to
block the camera but it kind of just
happens when you're painting awkward
freehand designs at a really awkward
angle with the camera blah blah blah so
I take off my striping tape and think to
myself wow I really didn't need to put
straight
tape to use as a guideline at all did I
let's just fix the bass swing because
Pat's have wait longer winks than that I
don't know how I'm going to fix the rest
of this can I just say that I really
hope no one is coming to this channel
and hopes of finding a talented freehand
nail artist because that's not me
however if you are looking for a
talented freehand artist whose work will
blow your mind away and make you believe
that you will never be able to
accomplish such things because you're
not that talented then I highly
recommend some of the French nail
artists out there such as tell topes
cherry nail art or Tashi no Hana I'm
some predicate Palantir say bloggers la
who dividend a hug out a Magna buzzy
your nail goals and y'all are impossible
to achieve nail goals mad props and
respect to all the French nail artists
out there okay back to Canadian nail art
reality and once again I'm pretending
like there's a point to these striping
tape gridlines maybe if I paint the
black over the orange hollow base you'll
see less of the freehand imperfections
because it's not as much contrast I'm
going to paint a cast in the middle of
these ones because black cats are a
symbol of Halloween I honestly don't
know why people don't like black cats
and consider them bad luck and associate
them with Halloween and scary things
like what are you saying if men she was
black you wouldn't like her you would
think she's bad luck like this is just
racist guys don't be racist against cats
black cats are people too I just decided
that this tutorial is very redundant and
you don't need to see this part add a
glossy top coat to help cover up all
those imperfections the thing with using
acrylic paint though
that after one coat of top coat it has
this weird textured effect because I
know acrylic paint absorbs top coat
weird something to do with science so I
always apply a second coat top coat to
make it nice and glossy all right there
you go you got some subpar Halloween
nails on your hands there's something
wrong with the white nail though I just
can't put my finger on it oh yes yes I
can there's no Halle wanna duck and take
my favorite hollow topcoat at the link
the video description box and apply one
thin coat over my nail to give it that
rainbow shine so many rainbows oh my god
it doesn't even matter if you can't tell
what patterns are under it who cares
it's hollow alright I'm feeling a little
bit better about this manicure after all
I'm going to try and do some better
Halloween nail designs for you guys soon
I promise for now I linked a couple
other nail art designs you can use for
Halloween in my nail porn out robe talk
to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
