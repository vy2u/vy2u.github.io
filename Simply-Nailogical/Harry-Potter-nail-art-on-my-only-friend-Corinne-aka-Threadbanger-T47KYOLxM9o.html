hello everyone it's me Christine again
joining me is me Corrine what up
Internet
we're gonna do our nails so oh oh yes
let's get started shall we
hey what do you do I mean if Monty burns
from the Simpson that's what I started
doing but then you snow I start I do all
kinds of looks like the claw or like a
velociraptor mmm that sound attack all
right are they okay so nails may be
painted or some point so today I'm gonna
paint your nails because we couldn't
think of any ideas to do together and
you've never done Harry Potter nails
before so as na ya no book Harry Potter
the world are both but the books always
better have you seen any of the movies I
think someone dragged me to one once but
I thought it was Lord of the Rings
well then so I'm not sure there you go
we can take the quiz to find out what
house you're in what house I'm in your
house yes where's my phone I got a
Google oh wait well yeah I guess we
could just take the next like 10 hours
to watch all the movies first what so
I've never had nail art done before Wow
sad life you live Wow
so pretty and sparkly I mean Halloween
let me see your nails
come on you're making my subject they
look nice yeah these are much better
than my sisters so I've got my hollow
pouch I carry everything in life around
in it oh my god okay I'm not gonna push
back your cuticles no it's too much
worthy yeah that bad
see look right now I'm wrapping your
tips I wanna see the colors I brought
for you so excited I smuggled them
through customs
oh now finals oh because I can't really
draw these little cat ears yeah that's a
special brush yeah it's a to clean up
your cuticles you know you know anything
like to get the paint off yeah right
yeah
shut up children what's happening out
there someone's getting murdered put
those children there get a job kids
I'm kind of job they're like 12 get off
my lawn go on Instragram so this finger
it's gonna be a lightning bolt and it's
gonna be gold hollow underneath there's
like lightning and harrypotter like
lightning strikes and then the magic
happens
know whose name shall not be spoken
cuz he's so evil that you don't want to
say his name because you invoke his
spirit and I don't see him golden all
the more worries are you bitch and come
on out so I'm painting um silver it's
gonna be opaque later don't worry it's
just the first coat is always less
opaque and then we're gonna sponge it on
I was worried what's a Golden Snitch it
is in the game of Quidditch whoo it's
the Wizarding game of Quidditch
erm sticks The Seeker mmm Golden Snitch
the game will be one Quidditch team and
he catches the Golden Snitch and it's a
really pivotal part of the story I need
to like look at Hollow to wake me up
this is a trick you better listen up I'm
sure you can learn that ok good dungeon
they call it the dab see when I think of
dab I think of something totally
different what it's illegal oh is it
like a street name for drugs your your
video will be Devon to Ty's diff we
start talking about that ok not that I
know anything about it it's just like
I've read a lot of articles you know I
don't know it dad dad dad we're gonna
make your nails fab this is a glossy
taco case you were wondering so it's
really thick and glossy oh yeah
let me see that taco horn well to the
reference chart we got to paint this
Illuminati Deathly Hallows oh the
Deathly Hallows mmm like Hollow
exactly I need acrylic paint because I
cannot paint with actual nail polish I
like to add my saliva it adds good luck
Oh
oh I probably shouldn't move during this
huh yep wow that was really good I'm
impressed it's a great fuckin line its
ability good oh it's okay I could fix it
a little trip all the toothpick trick I
don't know what that means
well you're gonna find out so when you
make a mistake all you gotta do scratch
it
it doesn't look like a triangle shape
but it looks like a really cool other
shape kind of that's like not even
straight sorry it's because I'm sideways
yeah but I'm reading excuses I sure
that's the Elder Wand what the Elder
Wand what so you press the Neve I know
down and we can do that thanks to our
glossy taco we take some black the rest
is really quite simple I could do with
Matt's clothes let's try it
where's the brush I don't know it did
not work out well at all do you do it
before it dries you have to pull it off
yes you're getting an A in my class
already we must work quickly like
Quidditch they don't think that no it's
not a big deal it nice yeah and what am
i doing the scholars colors of the house
mm-hmm
the house can lists the Ravenclaw house
colors it's like this color would you
say I'm sure I'm guessing you're
choosing that because there's holo in it
yeah again is that the secret to getting
a really clean line yes you could use
regular tape if you want but as
professionals use nail vinyls hands on
the level that you're going for Wow
seal it up right now I'm gonna make a
gold ball it's part of the game of
Quidditch and if the seeker catches this
ball they automatically win the game
uh-huh
oh my god that works so much better on
you than it ever has on me alleluia
alleluia oh yeah brilliant here yeah I
should start a singing grill do you
wanna
laughs I have a couple hit track I think
yeah really I think it would be great I
just really said do it that's a lot
easier than I thought it was gonna be
this is like surgery did you go to a
special nail art school yeah YouTube we
got to make the deathly hallows Hollow
hello if you hear me
although can you yeah so that will
sparkle in the Sun that's beautiful oh I
know now we're gonna add a glossy taco
on all your other nails my nails have
never been so beautiful
