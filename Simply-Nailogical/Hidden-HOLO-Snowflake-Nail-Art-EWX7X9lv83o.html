aren't these nails snow cool hello
everyone it's me Christine again and
welcome back to my channel where today
we have a video about actual nail art
and not something stupid
it's a fucking Christmas miracle hallo
shit I'm calling these wintry Wonderland
nails hidden hollow snowflakes because
in some light you can't really see the
snowflakes but when the light hits it
just right bad mother fucka Wow
yeah I said the nail art was serious not
me start off with the peel off face cut
and only I'm applying some baby blue
hollow it's the only one I had not
really a fan of this particular polish
because it's not that opaque but we're
gonna do a hollow nighttime gradient
over it so no worries just sticking on
my cuticle pili apron tape to protect my
skin from all the nail polish dabbing I
don't do shit in the kitchen but this is
one apron I don't mind wearing I just
want to point out that for this tutorial
I'm using only hollow nail polish it's
like the best video of ever made look at
that blue and black linear hollow though
oh they're so thick and rich and juicy
my god
I've used these in another video and
I've said it before these nail polishes
are bomb they are so opaque and so
hollow I love them they're great for
gradient ink
they're not always in stock because look
I mean look how good they're but I did
put links below and where you can find
them then you just keep dab dab dab into
your nails be fab and then you gonna
peel like no big deal
pretty flawless except for a tiny bit
left by my cuticle so I'm just taking a
cleanup brush dipped in acetone to get
that bit off and now it's time to make
it snow in hollow I'm adding a glossy
gel topcoat because we're using that
magical silver holo powder it works best
in my experience over a gel topcoat as
opposed to a regular nail polish top
coat now you're not technically supposed
to be using regular polish and gel
polish because regular polish doesn't
dry the same way that gel polish does
and so by even carrying the gel polish
in the LED lamp doesn't mean that the
regular now
under it is dry so if you do this just
make sure that your regular nail polish
had a crapload of time to dry beforehand
I left mine for like half an hour I've
learned so many things about gel polish
and fancy professional products this
year are you proud of me now we got to
make the hollow snow flakes by taking
these snowflake nail vinyls stencil
thingies pick a place on your nail where
you think it's gonna look best and press
it down firmly and oh what's this on my
other hand it's a beautiful grey
scattered flaky hollow polish oh my god
what that's right it's tiny holographic
flakes and a great jelly based perfect
for this mysterious hollow sexual who
likes to keep people guessing Oh haven't
you missed me the old school simply
illogical who actually does hurt nail
now we're going to take that magical
hollow powder last time I use this
particular one was when I did Joey
Graceffa snails and now I finally got
this magical hollow crack delivered to
my cold my very cold Canadian doorstep
all you got to do is use some kind of
eye shadow applicator to just push the
hollow in the snowflake that's it you
just got to rub it in a little make sure
not to go outside the boundaries of the
nail vinyl stencil now while there are
ways to use the nail powder with regular
polish and what's called a sticky base
coat doesn't really work with nail
vinyls because the nail vinyl would just
pull up that sticky base coat you need a
nice smooth glossy but hardened surface
for the nail powder to stick to it also
a surface that the nail vinyl can lift
off of without killing anything under it
up and remember I'm still wearing a
peel-off base coat and the nail vinyl is
not peeling shit up because the gel taco
is so hardened and resistant to nail
vinyls peeling it up one little trick
you can do if the nail vinyls were
giving you a little bit of trouble you
got the powder in places that shouldn't
have been is lick the end of a toothpick
make it a bit wet and just scratch the
excess powder off gently alright one
last haul of snowflake on my nail as a
shout out to all the special snowflakes
out there who got offended by literally
everything in 2016 we thank you special
snowflakes for giving us material to
make me
of May 2017 bring you happiness and a
sense of humor when you're done you can
dust off the challah powder with a fan
brush and or wet the tip of a q-tip and
just wipe it off your skin and now we're
done top it off with the final gel taco
to seal in the hollows mmm
gel topcoat poor women bake it one more
final time all right guys that's it now
you've got some Crouching Tiger Hidden
hallow nails you could have of course
just use regular silver challah polish
to do the snowflakes
I think the hollow nail powder makes it
so striking up it's the beautiful I love
it so much hope you all have a Merry
Christmas soon and a happy holiday
season I'm going to sing you a song now
ready on the twelfth day of Christmas my
true love sent to me twelve minutes

art vinyls I'm a genie windy pilaf big
