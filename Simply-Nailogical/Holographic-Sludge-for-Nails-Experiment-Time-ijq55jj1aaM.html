video time to put the nail back in
simply now logical well hallo everyone
it's me Christine again long time no
nails okay I'll stop and today we're
going to play with some hollow sludge on
our nails I found it fresh up in the
hollow mountains
obviously I had to get because I need
things that are all Owen squishy
naturally so this stuff is technically
called rainbow linear paste and by
rainbow stamen hollow oh so many words
to describe it highly concentrated
acting power oh I like the sound of this
already I got this hollow paste from
this shop that sells a lot of pigments
for DIY nail polish and other crafty
projects there's a link to their shop
down below in the video description box
it's also the same place I got that
crazy LCD color changing stuff from that
I used in a video a couple months ago oh
look it's me on the top of the packaging
a hollow troll so this my friend is a
very powerful hollow ball do not put the
hollow ball
I mean well no that's exactly what we're
going to do let's play whoa what is that
do you see the rainbow coming through
you're wondering what I do on the
weekends it's this stuff all right
friends it's experiment cam that's right
it's time to do experiments I got a
bunch of fake snail swatch things
because my own nails have betrayed me
here's a short life update for you my
nail is pushing through growing out a
bit but the brake is still too far down
to suffer through any kind of
experiments and sorry we just can't put
it through that kind of trauma right now
so we're going to paint a bunch of these
sake now sticks with black polish
because Hollow
always looks best over black and now
we're going to add a gel taco so you can
add a nice clean seal to the nail before
we start putting on some hollow stuff
make that shit for a minute and I'm just
going to first try what people normally
do with the nail powders and that's take
an eyeshadow applicator but dip it in
the hollow sludge and then gently buff
it onto the nail blue interesting looks
promising but as I keep on buffing it it
seems to be getting duller and duller
why why let's hollow why
I mean it's still hollow but it's a very
silver hollow you know what I mean it's
like two gray but how could we judge
this without any hollow reference point
I know we got to be good hollow science
Christine the science Queen King the
science we need so let's compare the
hollow linear paste to a bunch of
different hollow nail powders also
stayed to the end of this video if you
want to see some hollow witchcraft first
up let's try this hollow whose powder by
twinkle teeth same deal as before you
put on a regular black polish and then
you add a gel taco maybe bakes it for a
minute take the eyeshadow applicator and
put it on your eyes I mean put it on
your nail off that powder into the nail
oh yeah
Paul is looking good I may do another
video on a whole assortment of nail
powders that I have let me know down
below in the comments if you want to see
that but for now I did put links down
below in the video description box if
you want to find out where to get all
this shit next up from the same company
of the hollow sludge is the solar color
dust pure hollow powder that's how I
like my Hollow fresh uncut pure 100% oh
yeah that was a fun weekend oh yeah you
guys want to party with me now don't you
I also got this face hollow version of
the powder it looks much grayer kind of
hoping it looks like a black hollow
rainbow I have yet to see that but it's
not really working the way I thought it
would yeah maybe this powder isn't
intended for this particular use
sometimes these powders are supposed to
be used as pigments that you mix and
nail polish bases but hey I'm just
experimenting okay don't get mad at me
now let's test out this hollow powder I
got from nails 21 which is a very
hard-to-find brand from Portugal I think
it was the first hollow powder I ever
played with if you want to see my first
time there's a link for that video too
oh god just so hot oh I'm getting hollow
sexual right now now I anticipate that a
question might be how does this compare
to just regular silver hollow nail
polish why do we got to use powder well
let me show you this is probably one of
the staple linear hollow polishes now
don't get me wrong it's great
and I love it but the hollow payoff of a
hollow powder is quite different than a
haul of polish I guess you could say the
polish is a little more subtle I didn't
put it over black because it's supposed
to be opaque in two coats anyway now
what about a hollow taco I just like to
say those words let's be honest this is
my favorite linear hollow taco and just
one thin coat over black you get this
BAM dazzled hollow effect and here you
can see everything we just did compared
in one shot
clearly the hollow powders are the most
hollow since the hollow flame as they
call it is most intense can you handle
the hollow now I'm kind of just
satisfied that I wasn't able to make the
hollow sludge work okay why are you so
we call of sludge what I'm probably
doing something wrong so let's play
around shall we what if we mix it with
some clear polish Oh imagine they let
you do this in school you would all get
AIDS so I'm just going to apply it
straight on with a paintbrush and yeah
kind of underwhelming
not going to lie I mostly look silver
which is not as good as hollow but
interestingly when I started brushing
the remnants of the hollow sludge off
the paintbrush the hollow came to life
so it looks as if you need to dilute
this to actually have it be more Hollow
if that makes any sense this is where
you look up real instructions or some
scientific evidence on this phenomenon
that I know nothing about all I can say
is it's beautiful this is what my skin
will look like in my next life
now what if we mix it with some colored
jelly polish that is kenton clear polish
whoo baby pink holloman she would like
that it's a very understated pink color
but it doesn't satisfy me obviously now
what if we water it down oh my god
what is that did you do that second of
magic oh my god water down the hollow
why didn't I think of that water plus
holo equals life duh
so the holo effect shows a lot better
when it's watered down but I know it
looks kind of distressed maybe that's
not the ideal look but I think it looks
cool oh and hey wait a second what's
that on my other hand it's Hollow sludge
on my fingers don't ask me if I licks
them later so then I went to grab some
more water with my eyeshadow applicator
and discovered that the Hall of gods are
real oh my god Hollow can really walk on
water would you look at that
Oh
can you water marble with this oh my god
let's poke it out yet not really it just
looks like I'm breaking hollow ice
that's what I do with new people when I
meet them I don't just break the ice I
break the hollow ice because it was a
terrible joke let's move on let's stir
that shit up and oh my god you've just
entered the Hollow Twilight Zone every
time I add a little bit more of the
hollow sludge it just goes through and
makes all the water Hollow it's amazing
like look at the science what the fuck
okay I suppose we should do something
with this so I tried dipping a nail into
it like how witches would generally
water marble and that looks pretty cool
it's looking more Hollow and it's moving
it's moving let's try that again oh yeah
I normally don't dip my fingers into
water but when I do it's for Hollow oh
look I made an accidental inverse french
dip in the middle of my nail what if we
just take the little particles and get
kind of a water spotted effect Oh nope
nothing all right just one more time mom
I just want to go in the hollow pool and
cool not perfect I got some bubbles but
and here are the results of the hollow
sludge experiments
I'm sure the water ones would have
turned out better if I had a witch on
hand unfortunately I don't right now but
as you can see compared to the linear
hollow powders the hollow floods got
nothing on it I mean it all depends what
you're looking for maybe you want a more
subtle hollow glow I don't know we can't
be friends though now I anticipate that
you guys are going to ask me which
hollow powder is the best and honestly
they look pretty damn similar to me I do
see a very slight difference though one
of them appears to be more densely
packed than the other two in fact those
two look almost exactly the same one of
them is just a lot easier to get in
North America here's the denser packed
hollow up close I mean they're all great
I don't know why you want me to say okay
all hollow satisfies me in ways that non
Hollow does not
and all of this just makes me sad
because I can't put it on my broken nail
right now but I can do some experiments
for you guys so let me know down below
in the comments if you want some other
experiments allied nails watch down
because I'm just as up for them as I'm
up for making highly irrelevant videos
like simply face logical simply play
logical and whatever else the hell comes
from my brain but I'm glad you guys are
having fun watching me have fun - shut
up - all your mushy comments they're so
mushy but I appreciate them alright guys
that's it for today thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
