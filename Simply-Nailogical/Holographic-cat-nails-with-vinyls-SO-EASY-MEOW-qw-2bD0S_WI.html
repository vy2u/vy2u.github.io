cats on my nails maybe you thought I was
going to freehand some cat faces on my
nails you would have been wrong do you
want a teen cat head silhouettes on your
nails
well now you two can have them with
these cat nail vinyls from twinkle teeth
but first pay your respects to the
hollow this is none other than color
club's classic harp on edge
silver linear hollow Oh yeaa girl I'm a
harp on you it's a very strong token
silver hollow that everyone needs in
their collection you can find it on
mentees favorite nail polishes page yeah
that's right did you guys know my cat
has her favorite nail polishes on one
website she's very special
so aside from the hollow for this
relatively simple look I used a bright
neon pink and a black nail polish first
let's apply the hollow on the nail oh my
god so silky smooth look at that
flawless application that's just one
coat guys one coat hollow wonder now
personally I believe that one coat
wonders can only be wonders if they're
Hollow
look at that rainbow action guys add a
quick dry top coat because we're gonna
add nail vinyls next my god how many
times have I said that sentence cuts say
it's so often that when people call me
on the phone that's what I tell them
instead of Hello
when you're done take a few minutes out
of your busy and stressful day to stare
at your holographic nails here's a
scientific fact for you the rainbow
pigments in holographic nail-polish have
been proven to improve one's overall
mood and general sense of well-being
empirical evidence brought to you by
simply illogical simply peel you've come
back to your mother good girl you know
where your place is in this life it's on
my fingers I know you guys have been
commenting that you miss simply peel
because she hasn't starred in a tutorial
for almost four or five videos now she's
acting up a little bit she's a little
annoyed that I've been ignoring her your
behavior is excused today Missy screw
you soon flip you like a cat nail vinyls
look at them there's so many cats on
stickers I got them from twinkle because
where else do I get my nail vinyls for
cat heads are severed and they stick in
your vinyl just simply stick it on the
back side of the vinyl sheet and then
they'll come on
place the vinyl down on the nail and
then use some scissors to cut around the
edges to make it a little easier to peel
off as you can see I still don't have
the right scissors nope laziness now
we're gonna do a weird-ass gradient that
I don't think I've ever done before
kind of like checkers except pink and
black so it's way more interesting than
it came of checkers for you or checker
player when you were a kid or were you a
chess player oh I see how it is you were
a checker player who pretended you
played chess like the smart kids weren't
you so the trick with this kind of
gradient is to not blend it everywhere
up and down in side to side like you may
do with the normal gradient cuz we blend
it all around and mush it all together
and it would end up looking like
whatever color or black and pink me
what is that like brown I don't know
whatever it is it's ugly so be careful
to only dab straight down on your nail
when I was doing the very sides of my
nails with my nails are really curved I
was just using one of the far edges of
the sponge peel up the nail vinyl
carefully to reveal dem pitches peel off
simply feel like no big deal
simply peel you have failed me today
what's your problem you little bitch
let's put different nail vinyls on my
other nails cuz today I'm on crack yeah
I can't focus
these are swirly and fun I got these
little swirls from twinkle tea to you
obviously I thought it would be cool to
put four of these swirls on my nails
because do I really need a reason do I
seriously need a reason to tell you why
I decide to put things on my nails do i
no didn't think so
take your beautiful beads barred and cut
it off the sponge so you can make
another beautiful piece of art you don't
have to do this if your sponge is still
wet and you're moving from nail to nail
but because I take a lot of time like
horsing around with my cats in between
filming each nail it dried up the sponge
so I had to cut it to make a fresh
sponge for the next one that I filmed
which is this one these tutorials are
really misleading okay they make you
think it we did all this nail art in
five or six minutes
it's lies I told you it's all lies we
spent hours out into vagon me five
minutes of your pleasure do as many
coats as you
to do now have some fun peeling up the
little squirrel guys oh my god I hate
when that happens
god we almost had a disaster there as I
mentioned I always wear a peel off base
coat so that's what happened
he law simply feel like no big deal and
you get back there you go
fucker now here I have like a defective
peel if I obviously failed to press the
vinyl down completely so I can kind of
fix that by taking a cleanup brush that
I got from Twinkle t as well dip it in a
tiny bit of acetone drain out excess
acetone on a paper towel and very very
gently just pick up the extra pink or
whatever color if you have any extra
nail polish around your nail at all then
you can just use the same brush with
acetone to clean it up did you guys know
that I never do the nail art you see on
my other hand yeah this is why my other
hand is my trusted working hand and you
never see it because it's always working
cut the sponge again because it's really
satisfying
then you can line up all your pieces of
satisfaction and stare at them for a
little while yeah I'm going to the race
who's ready race it to the hollow
my fingers are dancing attempting cats
and my fingers don't forget throw on a
glossy top coat to make your home mani
shine and look awesome and I am
officially a crazy cat if you didn't
know that already from the pajamas I
choose to wear to bed and after work
starting at 5:00 p.m. and there you have
it this was officially the easiest way
to put cats on your nails you're welcome
now if you'll excuse me I gotta go find
some sunshine see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
