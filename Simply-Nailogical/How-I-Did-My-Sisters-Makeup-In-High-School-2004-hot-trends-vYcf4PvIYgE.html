again and here hello everyone is me
christine again okay you're fired
just kidding it's you great sister I'm
back by popular demand
so recently I've seen a lot of trends
where people are recreating their old
makeup looks but I don't really have
many makeup looks from high school that
are anything interesting or that I took
pictures of but what I do have are
pictures of when i did my sister's
makeup in high school oh this could be
bad so here's the thing about us they
need a little backstory song about us no
no no not a song story when we were in
high school I liked to experiment with
makeup except not on myself and I mean
not true go on except not on myself but
on my sister I was her guinea pig so
when we were young teenagers and we were
barred on a Saturday night we had fun by
doing crazy makeup looks and mostly me
doing her makeup for some reason I was
an aspiring makeup artist okay I needed
to practice my craft look how far I've
come
you've got nowhere I've been nominated
for two beautiful person a water one I
didn't think so
ready for the show no okay first what am
i doing this is the beginning of the
night before we got started you had
braces oh this is so funny to me that I
just took pictures instead of helping me
she took pictures you're having a great
time oh so what do you think of this
first love
although I do love the headpiece that
was a hair scrunchie no that was meant
for like going around your feet and put
it up this reminds me of when I did your
makeup recently the aquamarine love
maybe that's where I subconsciously had
inspiration from look at those
cheekbones
damn no this is me realizing what's
happening like please help me actually I
think you're pretending to shit on the
type oh my god so she asked me for a
Jessica Simpson makeover and this is
what I gave her she liked me Jessica
always had blue eye shadow you have
Elijah we basically look like twins
there what like we're we smoking
absolutely nothing so here we have look
number two that's what I call smokey eye
wow that gold really makes my eyes pop
those Canadians do our parental units
we're not available that evening they
aren't making sure we receive and that
was fine but we're getting off track
today's mission is to recreate the look
i did on my sister in high school which
one you want to slip the coin which
one's gonna be easiest to take off
Freddie let me take a closer look at
what I did
thank you I just remembered something I
have to I have to get somewhere it's the
next surprise I have for you no more
surprises this is from 57 years ago
this one is like one of my favorite
camera it's all dusty it's all broken
it's not done I think it's time to
through why do you still have this how
much wood these could go for it now
should we sell them on eBay pretty sure
this is the exact same glue that pigment
I also have some more recent makeup just
in case I didn't have that every single
piece of makeup from 2004 well I
certainly hope you don't that's called
being a hoarder
I'm just really prepared thank God I
kept this makeup or else we couldn't
make this video legit yo I went to going
with the sponge just fellip what if it
goes on my face and my face
disintegrates I never want to put makeup
on again wow that's so fascinating
sponge applicators died in front of our
eyes
rest in peace sponge applicator guess
when I found some brand new sponge
oh great okay get ready ah I think
what's really great about this makeup
look is you don't really need it to care
too much I feel dead inside so we got a
little shadow coming up here going
around the eye under the eye bags you
know I just always want to make other
people beautiful yeah so we're just
gonna go in with a little bit of a bluer
because I think I had a different blue
as well but I threw that out
unfortunately I want this to be it's
accurate it's possible so we're gonna
try and get a true color match this was
the Pigman we had back in 2004 everyone
yeah perfect
it actually does it doesn't look like I
used any actual eyebrow product on you
it just looks like brown eyes that you
smeared everywhere this is Mary Kay
brown eye shadow in coconut brown still
think you're off you're not as good at
this beauty thing than you think
we just gotta blend just a little look I
have a new wrinkle from me
same at the same wrinkle right yeah oh
my god you knew because our parents did
this to us every time they said
something wrinkles get man think of the
13 mad at the ranked all so we're gonna
move on to your cheeks so this line you
don't want to blend yeah like that yeah
oh shit
you could cut a bitch with those chico
many paparazzi's see if you can catch me
next I think I'm starting to look more
and more like Bella Hadid
what do we think what do you think I do
not have that hairpiece because I'm
pretty sure I threw it out when I
realized it was trash where did we get
those probably the dollar store oh we
got everything else like the makeup that
we gotta save money you know kids
you tell them money don't grow on trees
here you go ma'am put your bathrobe on
Jessica
keep it down
I'm Jessica ma'am what do you think of
my new look what do you think I'm
waiting I know are you speechless right
I also got your favorite then brings me
things too I think great sister idea
hang on my bangs out of my way here I
think what do you think you don't think
much I think it would be a fantastic
idea if I did the other look so that we
can both be from the 90s are you
hijacking my video right now yeah let's
do it
bit we're gonna do the best smokey eye
YouTube's ever seen you ready B yeah I'm

the gold under oh my god you're such a
bad makeup artist I like to do my own
