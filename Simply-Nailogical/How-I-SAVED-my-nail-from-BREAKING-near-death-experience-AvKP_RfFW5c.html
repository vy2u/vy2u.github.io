okay well maybe I didn't actually almost
break it that way but I was stuffing
presents and other crap into the car and
totally bent my middle nail forward and
started screaming because I thought it
broke but it didn't break this is what
my nail looked like a couple days later
once I took off my nail polish see that
little white line that's where it bent I
filmed these clips before doing other
nail arts you'll see them soon enough
but at the time I didn't know I was
gonna make this video and then I was
like why am I not going to make this
video so I made this video later a few
days later after my near-death
experience this is my nail up-close
after having showered which explains why
there's some clear spots in my nail if
this happens to you don't worry clear
spots are actually quite normal whether
your nail is wet or not but it's very
common in water-soaked nails but because
my nail is wet you can see the point of
weakness more clearly that the rear car
wheel I mean my idiot self stuffing
presents cause now my nail is completely
smooth it's not sticking out or actually
ripped but it's obvious I have some kind
of rupture in my nail fibers or what we
could call a fractured split as opposed
to an actually broken split nail and
it's not ripped underneath either whew
here it is again a few hours later after
some of the water dried out and you can
still see that sliver of sadness but
despite jamming my nails so hard and
being sure it had broken it didn't break
and there was no need to repair a ripped
nail fast because it didn't rip holy
 mind blown and now here's my
secrets this liquid gold in a bottle
otherwise known as nail and cuticle oil
made with jojoba oil jojoba jojoba
jojoba ho-ho bio oil I don't know how to
pronounce this just read the words on
the screen I put a direct link to this
oil in the video description box it's
actually gonna be on sale on January
12th and they only do that twice a year
so it's your lucky day maybe unless
you're late for this video and it's not
your lucky day
I use
this oil regularly between two and five
times a day or so at work and at home
because this magic oil keeps your nails
strong but flexible flexible is the
keyboard here this oil has a similar
chemical composition to sebum oil which
our bodies produce naturally which means
that your nails will actually absorb
this oil unlike kitchen oils and other
cheap cuticle oils that don't do
anything since your nails can absorb
this oil they will become more flexible
and resilient and this is a good thing
so that if you put too much pressure on
them they'll Bend instead of snap oh my
god the bend and snap
no no not bend and snap just bend no
snap thanks now imagine this if I were
just using a nail strengthening base
coat which at the end of the day makes
your nails hard then my nail would have
bent over my finger and snapped kind of
like this I've personally experienced
this in the past and was always pissed
off when tips would just snap right off
but I haven't used a nail strengthener
in probably over a year for this exact
reason instead I use this magic oil that
has become my crack but my addiction is
validated in the fact that it literally
saves my life every day now it doesn't
matter what length your nails are we all
know they can break at any length
imagine if my nail broke where it wanted
to break and how painful that would be
that's still on the fleshy part of my
finger
but not today evil objects in life not
today
in addition to using the oil there's a
few other things that help promote nail
strength and flexibility as well such as
avoiding letting water soak into your
nails so please still shower wear gloves
if you're doing dishes or better yet get
someone else to do the dishes for you
and another super important thing is to
stay away from bleaching products this
includes baking soda and hydrogen
peroxide whitening toothpaste bubble
white and all that other anti yellow
nail bleaching crap I see so many
YouTube videos on and I literally want
to yell at all of them if you bleach
your nails you will weaken your nail
fibers and the next time you do things
in life and bash your nail into
something it'll probably break this also
explains why yes my nails are yellow but
I don't give a because I'd much
rather strong and resilient yellow nails
that don't break easy and bleached white
thin peeling nails that break all the
time besides how you supposed to do
amazing nail art and glitter up your
nail if it's breaking all the time guess
what when your nails are yellow and
strong you just cover it up with nail
art and glitter and then there's no more
yellow anyways whoa your mind is blown
again ok I'm done but yay another video
where you actually learn things that are
useful now you too can get in on my
crack oil addiction by getting your own
oil I put the link below and the oil
also comes in a pen which is really
great for on-the-go nail hydration and
don't forget this oil along with a bunch
of other nail care products will be on
sale on January 12th alright thanks so
much for watching and stay flexible girl
see y'all later bye
