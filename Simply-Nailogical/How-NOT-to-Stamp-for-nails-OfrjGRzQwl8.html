you're gonna get a nail art lesson and
well not much but since you're a sadist
and love watching people fail you'll
probably enjoy this video anyways not
too long ago bundle monster reached out
to me to try out some of their nail art
stuff and given that bundle monster is
widely known for their stamping plates
and stampers galore I was like oh
this means I have to learn how to stamp
doesn't it but first look at all this
stuff is semi watch I don't even know
where to begin Bob I need a nap oh look
they tested it for me thanks guys
I put the links and descriptions for
everything you'll see in this video in
the video description box down below so
go ahead and click those links and he
just is overwhelmed as I was when I went
to their website and opened this package
also you can use my code simply because
I don't have any other codes that sound
different than that a bundle monster
store link down below for 10% off
whatever you want from the store
yay savings for more hollow obviously
being of hollows they sent me some too
oh yeah I'm feeling better about this
experience already okay enough with the
rainbow distraction I start off with my
favorite peel-off paste coat cuz I know
I'm gonna have to start over many many
times yeah yeah my nails are yellow blah
blah blah watch my other video but look
now they're hollow they're not yellow
anymore so this is a Stamper and so is
this and this jellyfish creature and
these little squishy candy looking
things but I thought about putting in my
mouth for a second I read somewhere in
cyberspace that you have to prime your
Stamper or something or whatever before
you start to stamp but I'm more of a
figure it out yourself version and I'm
also too lazy to take anyone's advice so
I'm just gonna start out by taking
bundle monsters black stamping polish
and putting it on the plate thingy that
haunts me every day on in
gram I scrape off the Polish with one of
the plastic bundle monster scraper
things and yeah Christine good for you
for listening to other people okay so
your plate should probably not be blue
when you go to start stamping yeah you
got to peel off that protective film oh
my god that sound is so sad is fine all
right let's try this guy I lay down the
Polish I just scrape it so seamlessly
and roll over the stamp and no but it's
not even coming off on paper I don't
understand why so then I just took some
acetone and rub down the Stamper and
then the plate too
oh yeah look it's so pretty I put Bundle
monsters hollow blue on my other hand
but this is before my fingers got ruined
by acetone from cleaning all the
stamping utensil wow it's making me even
more pasty or white I didn't think that
was possible let's do this again okay
swipe Stamper nope does anyone else
watch house of cards every single time I
say Stamper I just keep thinking of Doug
Stamper you'll notice I'm wearing gloves
now cuz I'm a princess and I don't want
to be cleaning these things with my
hands let's try this drippy number this
time I'm using bundle monsters more
credit card like scraper things instead
of the plastic scrapers and I think I've
hit my credit card limit
try it again clerk try it again and holy
 oh my god I did it let's put it on
paper and
even working on paper I don't understand
I think it's because I'm waiting too
long and between changing camera angles
and it's drying in between operational
constraints are so challenging you know
look at me I learned something from the
internet lint rollers now serve a cooler
purpose than collecting your pet hair
for worship look it's a maze amazing
that I swiped it and it transferred so
good let's put it on my pinky
because pinkies matter the least and I
don't know what happened I'm feeling a
bit Russian today so let's do something
that I'm clearly not ready for and do
some gradient stamping because look it's
cats and flowers well that didn't work
out too well did it yeah it bundle
monster also sells nail vinyls so let's
play with those to increase my poor
self-esteem right about now oh I
forgot to put on a quick dry top coat
under it because my mind was in the
stamping zone
why does a stamping gods height may pay
drunk squares let's see how you perform
mm-hmm hungover much let's try you
because you got arrows that go in more
than one direction oh my god she said
point erection holy I did it
but it's crooked Rosa's because they are
girly unlike me and how ironic designs I
like least work out the best so take it
off just take it off let's switch it up
and try this food plate because I like
food and food likes me oh yeah Florida
oranges and soju say and yes so
beautiful
a hollow orange like you've never seen
one before I seem to be missing the size
of my nail though
whatever details details candy yes I
need sugar in my mouth well that's
certainly not perfect but hey I'm
getting better let's try the shattered
glasses on because it's badass and
therefore it should work for me and bam
it's on my nail like it's actually on my
nail okay I know it's not perfect but
I'm just happy about the progress I'm
making right now okay be happy for me
too
alright now let's take this all off and
do it all over again let's try some
plain colored base coat so all the
polishes I'm using again are from bundle
monster these ones are technically
stamping polishes and I'm not really
sure if there's a rule against using
them a straight-up polish but if there
is then I just broke it I also appear to
be breaking simple rules on how to paint
your nails properly good thing that's
not what this tutorial is about what
it's a water marble on a point I was too
excited I forgot to film scraping the
two colors across I used one of those
massive stampers that are bigger than
your eyeball for this and clearly I need
more practice water marble plate I'm
just not ready for you yet I don't want
to hurt your feelings so I'll come back
to you later when I actually know
so this is what a squish you Stamper is
off so it's glitchy and this is what a
somewhat squishy rectangular stamping
head thing looks like I get the
impression everyone has their own
personal preference about what level of
squish they like if you know what I mean
and the shape that they like their
squish to be in - personally I'm kind of
feeling this semi squishy pink rectangle
one right now look at me now I can tell
everyone I can pre hand flowers I love
you pink squishy Stamper you do best
yes oh yeah I'm on my way to stamp town
Telia gala I'll be there soon okay quick
recap I think we did pretty good on this
round but I'm feeling particularly
overachieving today so let's try some
more oh my god so much sparkles look I'm
so distracted now what's stamping I got
cocaine for fairies shove
this is so satisfying right now I can't
even explain it such a good feeling oh
 I glitter came everywhere
oh well let's just pretend that was
intentional in setting the steam cuz
it's Christmas on my nails and there's
cocaine snow falling from the sky hey
angel in the snow my
under a lot of low dipping my new friend
and she's my very own Christmas hope
well that was weird let's do some chic
elegant stamping over that sparkle nail
cuz ooh la la so effortless so chic my
god you think I'm brunch
I like this arrow ish design so let's
try it again but not put it on crooked
crap doughnuts love me I don't know what
went wrong there
where'd the bottom map go so I realized
that the reason I kept putting this
dance on crooked was because I was
rolling this damper over my finger on
the table because I was worrying about
filming it for you guys
turns out that's bad don't do that and
do this instead this is a clip from
bundle monsters own video and it's very
helpful as you can see to bring the nail
to the stampers you have more control
over the placement of the design after
all my video is how not to stamp and
finally I don't really care how this
last one turns out if it's on my nail
then it's good enough for me perfect
don't even know what it's supposed to be
I'll just slap some glossy top coat on
all of them right about now and call it
a night
or a weekend rather cuz that's how long
I spent doing all of this and there you
go we got ourselves a mani that has no
discernible theme or anything at all to
tie it together it's pretty much just
random I also thought you'd like to know
that I smudged my thumb on my nose and
now if we could all just please take a
moment in pair respects to this nail art
graveyard I've got going on in front of
me there's literally a mountain of
acetone soaked cotton pads on my desk
and frankly I'm surprised I didn't get
the munchies I was so high off all the
fumes lesson of the day kids drugs are
bad but also stamp in a well-ventilated
area especially if you're a new Stamper
who's learning because you're going to
be doing lots of trial and errors mostly
errors I think my lint roller turned out
prettier than my nails okay quick recap
on life lessons learned in this video
stamping can be easy once you know how
to do it don't forget to remove the
protective film from the plate before
starting be patient and actually follow
other people's advice they probably know
what they're talking about
practice makes perfect unless you're
Russian then you're just born perfect
try all sorts of different things
different plates stampers squishy thing
Madhu's Stamper heads may work
differently for you depending on how
curved your nail is it may also be
necessary to test and prime your Stamper
before you begin but I'm not an expert
on that so I'll let you search that up
on YouTube yourself and find another
video that will actually inform you
practice practice practice did I mention
that you have to practice to get this
right hey I mean if I got it eventually
then certainly you can - I think bundle
monster is an awesome place to get
started if you're looking to explore
your stamping side of your sexuality
they also sell basically all the other
nail art tool things anyway so you can
think of it as your one-stop shop for
your nail art crack addiction you can
find everything I use in this video at
the helpful links in the video
description box down below and don't
forget to save your money with my code
simply and then go buy some hollow
glitter with it if you try stamping and
fail like I just did then use the
hashtag how not to stamp on Instagram so
I can take a look and we can feel bad
about ourselves together please
subscribe to my channel if you like my
videos and if you don't send still
subscribe to my channel because you're
eventually going to like them okay
thanks for watching see you later back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
