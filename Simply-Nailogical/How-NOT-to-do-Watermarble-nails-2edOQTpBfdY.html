that I said I would never do my advice
to you on how to do a water marble is to
watch this video and see how not to do a
water marble first things first
start with what you know I apply a white
base coat with color clubs French tip
because I'll be doing at neon water
marble or trying at least I got water in
a cup now what how to watch
there's too many pages out of water
marble with the water what back to other
things I know what to do
I applied simply peel latex berry around
my finger because I know shit's gonna
get messy now like I've seen girls
covering their entire hand almost so I'm
just gonna cover my entire finger
because I'm not sure how Matthew this is
gonna get right like we gotta prepare
for battle when you're not sure use
protection a lot of it am I supposed to
be putting it like under my nail like on
the other side of my finger I don't know
but just you know better be safe than
sorry kids it sparkles when it's dry and
now I'm ready for battle spirit fingers
will guide me through this hell oh look
I found a Benji hair in my water that's
a good start this is one dangerous game
I'm just gonna start with color Club
sweet getaway a neon pink and drop it in
the water cuz that's what you're
supposed to do right I don't know why
they're not spreading and and I don't
know this kind of looks like a science
experiment gone wrong
whatever just testing guys just testing
but the polish doesn't spread I'm taking
risks and trying more colors I've added
models own bikini floss gloss sweat and
floss cos bikini coral and they're not
really spreading they're kind of just
like getting diluted and whoa what is
that it's like a planetary explosion
well this is clearly not working out but
like I'm just having fun guys look it's
like a mini water marble it's a tiny
mini water marble in a really big Cup
let's play tiny bit resembles what
people do okay you know I'm just kidding
I'm just kidding like this doesn't count
this is not count next why is there like
little drops of polish at the bottom of
the cup how do you stop the polish from
sinking not helpful not helpful
keep going till I get a circle come on
circle what the hell are you doing stop
back so I'm definitely noticing that
some brands are creamier than others I
read that somewhere online but I didn't
pay closer attention this is just
practice guys just practice moving right
along why is the water so dirty and hard
to clean then she's gonna help me I
can't do it maybe mention how to water
marble for cats I'm just gonna stick to
two colors cuz like I don't need to
pretend that I know what I'm doing let's
keep things simple I read somewhere on
the internet that if you take a
toothpick and spread out the outer ring
the inner rings will spread out it's
like a magical drink of water marbles I
actually have something resembling a
bull's eye oh my god praise the Lord
gotta act fast now swipe crap move the
cup swipe swipe
that looks disgusting let's just pretend
I was just experimenting once again at
this point I'm totally blaming the
polishes I use for my failures so let's
try some others and blame it on other
polish I'm using a thin striping brush
this time and seems to work better than
a tiny dotting tool look it actually
resembles some of the designs I see on
Instagram it's like a flower look I even
swiped it the other way that's like some
complex shit still looks disgusting
though alright let's try a new color
this is SES I'm addicted it's actually a
pretty gorgeous neon aqua blue but like
nothing is happening like how many drops
is that like four and like nothing
happened
so clearly color Club is way better than
se like look at that like what the hell
just disappeared inside the circle se
you suck for water marbles blue I will
not give up on you let's try Nell zinc
Baker Street and she's fading same thing
just adding red into the water just go
swimming why don't you like it's the
freaking ocean this is more like a
science experiment to me than a water
marble because like different formulas
are doing different things is pretty
exciting like which nail-polish will I
drop in next it'll make the whole cup
explode I'm too stubborn and stuff on
this pink yellow blue color scheme so
I'm gonna keep trying it even though I'm
failing finally I have a miniature
lopsided bullseye forming okay even
though I can't get my circle straight
like this is not not so bad not so bad
kinda looks like a tornado help I can't
stop adding colors yo guys that looks
pretty cool pretty freakin cool okay
should we try this should we do it okay
so like I'm just supposed to like dip my
finger in it or something I'm just gonna
use my pinky let's see how this works it
uh help I can't decide which way to dip
it this is I have so much anxiety right
now let me just go for it okay
like what the hell and peeling off the
peel ruined it
like it wasn't ruined before man gee
teach me how to water marble okay I'm
gonna stop trying to be a hero and I'm
just gonna stick to two colors I think
I've learned my lesson I don't even care
if this is like the smallest water
marble to dip a finger in ever
I'm trying it with my pinky I did you
did she dip we dip you dip dip it in the
water what are your secrets okay like
what the hell it's all messed up on my
nail but I can actually see a pattern on
my skin clearly God hates me I've had
enough I am a warrior I will defeat you
wait look the pattern even looks like
actually pretty good guys like it's
looking good
ooh trippy it's like I'm on LSD okay I'm
cheating I don't care anymore
don't judge me you know what whatever
like I've seen people make water decals
with water marbles because clearly
dipping my nail in them is failing me so
I'm just gonna like let it dry and
that's what I did for about an hour and
I'm just gonna like pull it out very
gently of this stupid water filled Cup
and lay it on a plastic sheet okay now
what do I do with it though I what do I
do with this I don't know what to do
with this now let's try cutting it I'm
like super nervous or breaking it here
taking you know their five hours to make
the same pattern so I think you're
supposed to put taco to like make it
stick on the nail I don't know I've
never done these kinds of vehicles but I
just used like clear polish now what do
I do I have like a huge pin on my nail
so I try and press it down
I don't have those magical scissors that
it seems all the Russians on Instagram
have like why don't I have those I have
to use like these clunky scissors that
you're supposed to use for like
children's arts and crafts and they are
not very helpful
I've seen people just kind of dissolve
the sides of the decal with acetone and
cleanup brush like man this is nasty
like ooh why do people do that Kim like
beyond annoyed so I'm just gonna pull
off my simply peel right now it's like
that damn like I can't take this anymore
I can't
Oh cleanup sucks look at though my water
marble specimens back to the lab let's
try using this serial killer esk scalpel
thing I don't know why I didn't think of
that in the first place it's a lot
easier to handle than a large pair of
scissors that cleanup actually went not
so bad now let's do the middle now and
this one really matters cuz it's the one
that I'm gonna give everyone the finger
with oh I'm so over this let's just talk
out this shit and get out 18 million
hours later I have three nails that kind
of look like I want a marble cut really
I cheated and a pinky that I just didn't
change because I don't care anymore I'm
done alright guys I think it's pretty
clear now why I don't do water marbles
because they suck I'm just kidding
lots of people can do water marble it's
really good but those people aren't me
and to all the people who can do a water
marble I really want to give you a high
five in the face thanks for watching and
taking some joy in my failures you sick
people see you next time when I probably
will give you a tutorial on how to
actually do something instead of how not
to do something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
