a well just remember that nobody's
perfect or whatever limb they tell
you in grade school in today's tutorial
I'm going to show you a bunch of things
you might fail at when attempting to be
a gradient hero almost everything that
could go wrong did go wrong so not too
long ago I posted these Canadian flag
nails and asked you guys if you wanted
to see what I'd call this blue and mint
nail fail you said you wanted to see it
what a leading question though really
would someone who really didn't want to
see it take the time and effort to
comment that they didn't want to see it
ha no in any case here's the nail fail
this may look pretty cool to some but
I'll show you how it's borderline nail
fail because sometimes a nail fail isn't
just about the end result on your nails
it's about screwing up at multiple
points throughout the process start off
with a seemingly simple step of painting
your nails one color this is floss gloss
glow star a minty creme fail number one
know how to paint your nails one color I
don't even know what happens there I
blame it on the camera angle what's your
Excuse next up add some simply peel on
your skin to avoid failing at messing up
your cuticles you can watch my helpful
video battle between six different
peel-off products or you can watch my
more recent and less helpful video on
how to refill your simply field you will
learn absolutely nothing so to make this
middle slash returning gradient business
I call it returning since it returns to
the same color on two ends I thought I
was being clever by cutting the sponge
to exactly fit my nail because if I just
put exactly what I want to appear on my
nail on the sponge and then press it on
my nail it will be like a magical
projection right yeah not so much this
ended up causing some bad color bleeding
probably caused by
involuntary side-to-side sponge action
thing that I'm too used to doing and all
my other gradients ill number two don't
always trust what makes sense in your
head I tried a new method of just using
two strips of colors instead of all
three in my recent tended a flag nails
and it worked out much better kind of
hard to explain but if you just watch
that video length up in the left-hand
corner you'll see why this method is
much better for less bleeding of colors
moving right along I can recover right I
go to lift up my simply peel and what do
you know there's a sticky bastard if you
watch my videos and you've seen this
happen many of times let's be clear it's
not the fault of simply peel it's the
fault of my peel off base coat problem
is I'm too stubborn to use regular base
coats and remove my nail polish with
acetone or nail polish remover like most
normal people in the world so unless you
like torturing yourself and feel like
redoing your complicated gradient just
use a regular base coat so when you use
the peel off base coat and then put
simply peel right beside it they end up
sticking together and can sometimes peel
off the base coat when you go to peel
off your simply field this would apply
to peeling anything including simply
peel or other liquid latex products
around your nail and peeling nail vinyls
off the nail do add a quick dry top coat
before adding the vinyls that's a good
thing that you should do do apply simply
peel again before doing a second
gradient to make things even more
complicated do recycle your sponge by
cutting it for a fresh edge do buy all
your nail vinyls at wowt.com and use my
code simply for 10% off do lift a bunch
of nail vinyls up at once then proceed
to weed out every other one to get
perfectly even spacing so at this point
you're probably thinking that things are
going pretty well so far aren't you I
applied the opposite order of the
returning gradient on my fresh sponge
edge and I was like this is going to
look so cool it's going to be so trippy
and everyone's gonna be like oh my god
how did you do that except that it looks
like a milky cloud with stickers there's
more than one thing going wrong here
we got an opacity problem where the mint
just does not want to layer nicely over
the blue and we got a formula mixing
problem because the royal blue shimmer
doesn't really want to play nice with
the mint green creme fail number four
use polishes you know are opaque fail
number five avoid mixing polish formulas
if I had used two creme polishes or two
shimmers things probably would have
worked out better I was so desperate to
get these colors to blend I tried to
force it by sponging on way too many
coats that I can count don't do that cuz
then it'll just get really clumpy and
gross fail number six don't do so many
coats especially over nail vinyls the
polish that's left is all thick and
goopy it's like a bunch of chevron scabs
and the gradient itself is now not well
blended it's very smushed and it's
uneven Mitchie you're trying to record
but since I went through all this
trouble let's just cover it up with a
top coat and pretend like it's totally
fine in better gradient news some of you
have been asking for a remake of my
one-minute scaled reciprocal gradient
tutorial that makes absolutely zero
sense one of these days I will remake
this video or something similar to it
with voiceover and hopefully it will
make sense for now you'll just have to
watch the 1-minute video approximately
18 times
hopefully this how not to do a
complicated gradient tutorial gave you
some tips on what not to do when
gradient ink I just made a verb it's
gradient a maybe one day I'll make a
video on how to do it right thanks so
much again for watching guys and please
remember to subscribe so I can get a
fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
a Canadian penny the fun menses college
education of course see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
