your nails look like when you take out a
hater well I mean not that the hater had
hollowed glitter blood because they're
obviously a loser and their blood
doesn't sparkle what I really meant was
while you were busy taking out the hater
you accidentally cut yourself on
something irrelevant and then you
started bleeding hollow glitter because
you are a progeny of the unicorn species
all right let's get bloody I'm going to
start off by changing my nails a nice
base coat of white polish so far this
tutorial is normal since I'm going to
paint paint on my hand I had to use
something that wasn't going to kill me
and that's why I chose acrylic paint it
says it's non-toxic and that you can
clean it with soap and water but as
you'll see I did none of those things I
saw my nail from nail decor paint her
entire hand with acrylic paint so I was
like well if she did that and didn't die
clearly I'm gonna be okay
whose sparkly rainbow Hollow I mean
brushes that's what we're looking at
yeah you got to find a brush to paint on
the red paint look at me practicing my
blood drips it's pretty hard to mess it
up isn't it we'll get into the hand
slash finger painting part of this
tutorial later but for now let's start
with the nails there's really not much
science to this part basically just
painting on a pattern of a bunch of
different blood drips but remember
you're going to cover them all in hollow
glitter so it doesn't need to be that
perfect just as long as it kind of looks
like it was dripping something keep in
mind the fact that you're going to
continue the dripping beyond the nail
onto the finger so have the drip kind of
protrude towards that direction thing
where you're going to continue it and
words come out of my mouth
just look
do paint all your other nails the same
way but make sure your blood drips look
a little different on each nail because
no bloody hater adventure is the same
probably best to add a second coat of
acrylic paint because this acrylic paint
sucked oh my god too thin is terrible
hello its me I was wondering if after
all these years you'd like to meet just
pretend there was a gel background music
playing over that who are we kidding
anyways I discovered hollow like two
years ago so I don't need to meet her I
know her very well alright how do we
stick these suckers on our nail I'm
going to use the clear polish not a top
coat because top coat will dry too fast
and clear polish gives me more time
because I'm slow and then after you put
some clear polish on all you got to do
is take a toothpick lick the end of it
to make it a little bit wet and then
pick up each hollow glitter one by one
and tack it on the nail one by one I
recommend working in small sections so
your clear polish doesn't dry up it's
that time in every tutorial where
there's too much video and not enough to
say so let's just listen to some music
I just use my finger to secure the
hollow glitters down on the nail no my
god it's blue Hollow I seen you before
and now you got to repeat all those
steps on all your other nails or just do
one nail if you want that's fine then
it'll be an accent bloody nail whoa look
at that ghost action guys
yeah I'm sorry I hired a ghost for the
rest of this tutorial because I got
really lazy and you know what's coming
next yeah that's right we got to put
glitter all over our hands too because
there's no fun and not being extreme I'm
using simply peel which is a liquid
latex then I'm going to put on my finger
to protect myself from random chemicals
so my first idea was to paint on the
bloody drips with the paintbrush and
simply seal but then it did this so
don't do that because you'll ruin your
nice nail art brushes so instead I
roughed it the hard way and use the big
thick brush in a simply peel bottle to
paint on the drips because then I'm
going to paint acrylic paint over this
which kind of defeats the purpose of
using non-toxic paint because liquid
latex is supposed to protect your skin
from toxic stuff - I don't know okay
full disclosure I'm not a makeup artist
and I do not know anything about
special-effects makeup or whatever just
a nail art it's okay I don't even know
what it means to paint things on my skin
so it's probably safer if you don't
listen to anything I'm saying or
recommending and do this at your own
risk I will not be held liable if you
ruin your hands or die I think the main
reason why I decided to use simply peel
under the acrylic paint and glitter shit
is that I knew was going to be really
challenging to take off so by using some
we feel makes it all that much easier
look it sparkles when it's dry well
since I ruined this stupid brush I might
as well keep using it to paint on the
acrylic paint over top of the simply
peel blood drips another good reason for
using simply peel for this kind of thing
that I'm just going to pretend I knew
all along but really I only realized
later is that because it's liquid latex
it's flexible which is a good thing
because you flex your fingers even if
it's unintentional now I don't know for
sure but I would imagine that if you
painted your entire hand just with the
acrylic paint and then you went to go
make a fist with your hand all the paint
would probably crackle and look gross
around your knuckles and all the creases
in your hand
it might even flake off and look all
disgusting I don't know let's off nail
decor a nail decor what did you do after
this did you just wash your hands or did
you try and move them around what
happened we want to know all I know is
that the paint didn't crackle up when I
moved my fears around and I'm going to
attribute that to my intelligence in
deciding to you simply feel beforehand
all right now it's time to wait seven
more hours of your life by putting
hollow glitter all up and down your hand
so originally I thought it would be
enough to just apply more acrylic paint
and then stick the little glitters on
while it was still wet but it wasn't
enough they just kind of flaked off
right away so I did something I don't
think you're supposed to do which is put
nail polish on your skin but I got
simply peel under all that shit looking
out for me so I'm invincible now you're
probably thinking Christine this is
going to take you 37 hours to complete
you are so dumb you should just pick all
the glitter up and just smack it on all
in one go oh yeah smart ass well I'll
have you know that I tried that and the
result was that it does not look like a
good glitter placement for someone with
those UD alright now back to the only
way I know how to make it perfect and so
basically just continue that for another
7 hours on all of your fingers and
in the meantime I'll ask you guys what
are you gonna be for Halloween I'm going
to be a nail artist because I'm not
going to be doing anything on Saturday
night other than editing more tutorials
for you guys but for those of you who
are going out either to get free candy
or get shit-faced wasted while you look
all sexy are you going to invest as much
time in your costume that's only like 5%
of your entire body and I only did one
hand you really think I would do both
hands with this ha ha ha the ghost is
back for Halloween this is Halloween
this is Halloween Halloween Halloween
Halloween yes this is what my bleeding
emotions look like so sparkly and now
we're going to waste more time by
outlining all that bloody glitter in
black acrylic paint to give it that
extra pop you know
alright so practice a little bit on your
container lid I like to do that before I
start painting anything and I discover a
cat hair what else is new thanks men'she
so just take your detail nail art brush
and black acrylic paint and simply
outline all your drips of blood I'm most
likely going outside of the simply peel
lines here with the black acrylic paint
but since this acrylic paint is
apparently non-toxic then I am 99.9%
sure that I'm not gonna die oh yeah we
gotta outline the black on our nails too
I almost forgot I had nails first check
in their skin painting was getting me
way more excited this is proof that
ghosts exist I have no idea why that
happened to my camera I'm not even
kidding like there's no film or filter
over it was there now it's gone now it's
gone where the hell did it go like don't
know ro
shit happens when you kill a hater I
guess finish outlining any remaining
bloody drippy glitter anywhere else on
your fingers and finally we have reached
the last nail in this episode triathlon
dive run here it's also easier to make
sure that the blood drips on your nail
and on your finger are lining up
properly by just adjusting the black
outlines and there we go oh my god
bloody ha la boca and in Boca Boca Boca
Boca Boca Raton I know the only thing
missing from this mani is that it's not
shiny well I mean like the hollow
glitter is sparkly and shiny obviously
but I mean shiny as in like glossy Joe
defect shiny so that's exactly what
we're gonna do just so I wouldn't have
like ridiculously thick nail polish top
coat on my finger i watered down some
pre-existing really old taco with some
nail polish thinner and then put that on
my skin because I thought well it's
probably not going to kill me that much
even if it penetrates sembly peel
because I ended down a lot right so it's
like thinning down the toxins you know
so I won't get stage 4 cancer I'll
probably just get stage one cancer
that's not funny don't joke about cancer
then I used a normal non watered-down
glossy top coat on my nails so I keep
forgetting I have nails it just seems so
small and unimportant in relation to
this massive finger canvas I've just
discovered and this is the final nail
guys on
how am I actually finished I feel like
I'm in a dream I'm so high on fumes
right now but damn girl this look is
badass everybody don't be jealous of you
on Halloween night especially those
little sluts you know the ones I'm
talking about the ones you probably
wanted to murder here's a small tip make
sure you do it with your hands behind
your back so that the police don't
discover fragments of your soul left on
the crime scene see how I can bend my
hand and still use it like a normal
person in life isn't that great
yeah it is I probably should have
mentioned before we started this
tutorial that the prerequisites for this
tutorial was having no life and after
Halloween is over you're probably asking
yourself how the fuck do I get this shit
off my hands well I'll show you in
another video yeah I made another video
because I know you guys want to see that
peel porn action so you can head on over
to my other video tutorial on how to
remove glitter from your skin I hope
everyone has a happy Halloween and
remember girl you slay those haters you
slay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
