water marble Queen I'm just kidding so
you're probably here because you've seen
a bunch of videos on YouTube where women
perform witchcraft in a bucket of water
that's ironic because I thought witches
died in water I guess that makes me a
witch because I certainly died when I
tried to attempt this many many times so
I was like that this Gollust
I'm gonna beat the system how about I do
a water marble that's not even a water
marble this is how to cheat at water
marble part 1 use water marble designed
nail vinyls as of the day of making this
video there's three different water
marble design vinyls that you can get
all from twinkle tea calm I put the link
down below and you can also get 10% off
with my code simply because we also know
how to cheat at the money's game ok
let's do this first I'm applying simply
peel around my nail because no this is
not even necessary to do a water marble
nail vinyl I just felt like making this
design more complicated because I can't
put and meet simply filled because I'm
going to put a gradient on the base of
my neck by the way I am using a latex
free makeup sponge that's how I think
you're supposed to put on your
a stew sponge the colors on my nail as
for the simply peel and all the nail
polishes used in this video you can find
them all at the different links below
down in the video description box
now we gonna peel off simply peel like
no big deal okay got it girl even know
what accent I'm supposed to be like
crack addict to accent channel now add a
quick try top coat because we're gonna
add nail vinyls next I feel like it's
been so long since I said that sentence
and it brings me such satisfaction to
say it I'm gonna try out the floral
water marble design first little tricky
to get the little pieces inside of it
out so just kind of stick it on the
other side of the final packing and the
small little pieces will peel out in
English doesn't matter cuz you just see
what I'm doing in the video now put it
on your nail it's so easy I know now I
like to make different cuts around the
vinyl because it kind of helps it give
way and it's easier to press down
smoothly on your nail especially if your
nail is curved like mine oh my god what
is that black hollow magic in a bottle
that's right a snail porn it's magical
rainbow nail porn it's a hollow space
orgy and I want in on that orbit so bad
you can use whatever polish you want to
cover on top of the vinyl but it's gonna
be way more awesomer if you use a
magical hollow polish you can find this
flood of a black hole rainbow polish at
the link below now you have to use your
brain to fill up the nail vinyl I know
it's asking a lot fill it up in the
direction that will make the vinyl come
off easiest which is the direction I
just did the job Christine had
explaining why you do things
if you have a tiny bit of polish that
went outside the lines and on your
cuticle not to worry just use a cleanup
brush I got mine from the same shop I
got these Lionel's and then add a glossy
top coat so you can lock in that secret
well it's not secret anymore because I
just told you but you know what I'm a
nice person and I like to share my
secrets and just think of all the color
combinations and possibilities or we
could just stick with this one this one
looks great as it is well okay that was
so much fun let's do it again but with a
different type of water marble nail
vinyl this time I'm starting out with
the creamy white base coat mmm I love it
when that cream slides right on my nail
I'm using my hands-down favorite white
nail polish I put the link below it does
get a little bit thick and so that's why
I end up cleaning up the cuticle area
but it's well worth it for this creamy
payoff now add a quick dry top coat and
fill in the blanks that's right we're
gonna add nail vinyls next again now
here's a different water marble design
option you can use if plural water
marbles aren't really your thing looks
like we've got lots of Wi-Fi slap some
simply peel around your nails because
we're gonna do a gradient again but this
time we're going to change it up and do
a gradient over top of the vinyl if you
accidentally simply peel onto your nail
just take a toothpick and gently push it
off stick on that water marble vinyl
according to how you want that design to
turn out on your nail isn't that great
that you can actually predict how it's
gonna go down
unlike traditional water marbles where
you dip your finger into that cup and
what comes out is a mystery let's do a
rainbow of bright colors because that is
an accurate reflection of my current
mood I am so happy right now that all I
got to do is dab dab dab that water
marble onto my nail squeezing an entire
rainbow onto my
now was quite challenging because the
space is not that large I added a second
coat of spongy Brainbow goodness it's
not your best fig Kristine not your best
fade but I couldn't help it I was just
too excited to get to the peeling part
one tip would be to do this quicker than
I did it yeah I took my sweet-ass time
just being amazed at the fact that there
was a water marble vinyl that existed so
that's why I have a couple little gooey
stragglers that kind of snuck out a
little edges there I cleaned them up
just a little bit adding a nice glossy
top coat will smooth out all of that
hard work and hell yeah you got a water
marble rainbow on your hand my blending
technique was not on point today them
look at that thing key and so there you
go now you learn secret number one how
to cheat out water marbling and here's
my message to everyone who can
successfully water marble with water
before we go I think we need to fix
something and that's add some hollow
topcoat on to the water marble
I'm currently collecting hollow top
coats for a future video on what's the
best hollow top coat but I thought I'd
try it out here that holographic sticker
though I think it's even more
holographics and the actual hollow
topcoat solution in the bottle which is
quite liquidy in fact it kind of reminds
me of water no ooi water why anyways
this hollow top coat is not that
concentrated but I guess it depends on
the look you're going for and I did not
want to cover up my rainbow magic but
rather compliment my magic trick
performance
and then added a final glossy top coat
because honestly I wasn't sure if I
could trust that hollow top coat to
perform as a top coat does that make
sense
alright now let's just take a moment to
reflect on how awesome these water
marble nail vinyls are ironically even
though my channel name is simply no
logical I tend to do a lot of overly
complicated nail art that almost no one
is going to try and attempt themselves
but this one is actually simple
literally just take a sticker that looks
like a water marble you paint over it
and bam you're a fuckin Russian and
that's it for today's edition of how to
cheat a water marbling please be sure to

alerted when I upload the next one and
if you're not subscribed to my channel
