and how's about a quick recap for all
the new people watching today so you saw
all these great videos on YouTube about
water marbling and then decided to give
it a go yourself and then you dipped
your finger in that bucket and it turned
out like shit so last week and my how to
cheat at water marbling part one video I
showed you how to get the water marbling
look without doing any of that water
crap and because we big cheaters at life
I'm going to show you a second method
and how to cheat at water marbling part
two you're going to need a silicon mat
there's a couple of them in the nail art
market these days but right now I'm
going to use this one because it has
this special feature called the create
and contain circles we'll be exploring
them shortly and we'll also be exploring
some heroin stay tuned so basically a
silicone mat is perfect for applying
nail polish on it because it won't dry
and then you can drag a design into it
you could do the same thing directly on
your nail sure but if you're like me
then you're probably gonna fuck it up
more times than once by using the mat
you're making your own decals decals
whatever and that way you have an
infinite number of times to get it right
it's also great for making decals for
your other hand not that I ever do my
other hand but some normal people do
but what dragging tool should I use I'm
gonna test out all them for you because
I love me some experiments I'm trying
out a striper brush first and basically
what I'm trying to do is mimic the
common water marbling pattern that looks
like this
obviously the brush is making it look
like shit though next let's give the
striper brush another go but this time
I'm not pressing down as hard I'm just
giving it a lie
touch on the surface it definitely works
but I don't really like how thick the
brushes so I've seen some professional
water marble errs use something called a
water marble tool and obviously I don't
have one of those but they look like a
dotting tool to me so I'm just gonna use
a tiny dotting tool see what happens I
feel like it wasn't tiny enough this
time I'm trying a sewing pin and oh yeah
that looks good you think I was a
professional whoo let's go the other
direction I see people do this all the
time and I want to be just like them oh
that looks like such a delicious cake I
wish it was edible now I'm trying a
safety pin that I just bent to fit but
it's a little bit on an angle so I found
it a little awkward to drag it with the
camera in front of me and not tip my
hand in a puddle of what nail-polish
still looks good though and just to give
everyone equal treatment I'm trying out
a small nail art brush slash detailer
brush go home drag marble you're drunk
so by the way if you haven't figured it
out yet these aren't water marbles per
se they're called drag marbles or dry
marbles because you don't got a play-in
no harder to make this magic it's not
the best you've ever seen
but practice makes perfect as does being
Russian and using a bunch of different
polishes some creme and some hollow of
course so I can play with the formulas
and see which drag marbles the best
let's do some more because I love
wasting my nail polish oh good here's an
example of what not to do don't press
down too hard with your dragging tool or
else you'll break up the Polish like
Moses and the red seed I am looking for
Wi-Fi so by now I've decided that I like
the sewing pin the best but it was
really awkward to hold up stupid ball so
I made myself a new invention chop the
ball off the sewing pin shove it into
the back of an eraser I wasn't quite
sure how to maneuver this around without
stabbing myself so I put an eraser on
the other end now who wants to grow some
marshmallows
I took the eraser off of the side that
was the pointiest and then shove the
other eraser back into the end of the
and mrs. MacGyver and I'm ready to drag
it's actually pretty challenging not to
press down too hard with the needle when
you're doing this because I feel like
anytime you have a sharp pointy object
in your hand you just feel inclined to
stab something you know what I'm saying
I should probably explain how I've been
cleaning my utensils you can wipe off
some of the excess polish on the mat
itself or dip it in a cap filled with
acetone and then rub it off on paper
towel oh wait what am i doing that's
what these circles are for you're
supposed to put acetone among other
things you want in these circles so you
don't have to use a cap like I just did
good job Cristy you really know how to
demo a product wait a second
if I can put acetone in here then I can
put water in here holy shit I have a
genius idea and it involves shooting up
not drugs
silly shooting water what if I inject
water into these little circles and make
it like a miniature water marble Cup
without the mess of the Cup and all that
bullshit because of the silicone mat
surface the water didn't want to spread
it wanted to stay in a tiny bubble so I
had to push it out with the syringe and
make it spread and looks like I'm gonna
try to water marble after all and I
still suck at this
yo what if you could suck the water out
from under the water marble and that way
it would dry fasters you can turn it
into a deagle just pretend the water
marble looks good okay now I'm excited
let's try this again I feel like a legit
scientist right now I mean I'm doing so
much science I've got a petri dish a
silicone mat working space station a
professional-grade syringe but shit that
looks terrible whoa it's like an amoeba
a hollow amoeba I think I almost felt
that one up on purpose just because I
wanted to suck out the water from
underneath because it's so satisfying
okay let's try this again with boring
car and polish because I feel like it
probably water marbles better but what
is that see why did that happen
to that one ring no circles I do stay in
uniform and dragging the Polish is just
not working for me
I'm deflating it like my emotions okay
that's it I give up I suck at real water
marbles so I'm just gonna put out a
call-out to anyone who can actually
water marble and has this mat please try
this yourself try it and then tag me on
instagram tag me on facebook take me on
youtube tag me on snapchat oh I don't
think you can do that do whatever you
need to do to try out this technique and
get it to work because clearly I just
don't have this talent oh by the way
this isn't actually a heroin syringe she
used it for men she's medicine when she
was a sick little baby okay back to
reality I guess we got to figure out
Matt marbling look at that stop motion
action Christine have you not learned
anything stop dragging so hard feta
would not be proud of you I do like this
color scheme though so I've decided to
stick with these three primary colors
well I guess pink isn't a primary color
is it to made those rules anyways you'll
pardon my french but this looks amazing
but I guess that's what happens when you
try and drag marbles like 72 times these
are the three colors I ended up going
with I put the links below except for
one of them because you can only get it
in Canada sorry the rest of the world
now watch me drip kill it now watch me
drag dry okay now watch me drip drip now
watch me drag drag and you
with ooh watch me watch me ooh watch me
watch me ooh watch me watch me and now
we let dry and step away from the mat
because we've inhaled too many fumes
look at that pretty matte also I got a
second camera so I can show you this and
show you my camera setup how cool is
that
simply analogical at work in the lab so
I think I waited maybe 20 or maybe 30
minutes before peeling them off but
there's two different ways you can peel
them off one is just peel it off with a
little tool like what I'm doing here
but I realized that it wasn't really
working out that well because it kept
getting a little bit stuck and it didn't
want to come off in one clean pull and
then it started ripping in the middle
and was ruining my artwork so I was like
well crap I should probably find a
better way to get this off when in doubt
do what the Russians do at least the
parts that don't require actual talent
and in this case that meant putting on a
quick dry top coat over top of the decal
letting that dry for another ten minutes
or so and then peeling it off I was kind
of hoping that I didn't have to use a
top coat because then I'd be wasting
like eighteen times as much but in the
end it peeled up a lot better with a top
coat so I'd probably recommend doing
that if you don't want to risk ruining
your beautiful designs top coat not taco
why do you guys think I'm always saying
tacos stop thinking about food go eat
something also I need to warn you about
a Polish that I now know stains a
silicon mat the mat would stained a nice
neon greenish yellow and it would not
come off with acetone I probably should
have read the warning about staining
polishes I guess life gave him lemons to
stay in things with but guess what
staining will not affect the
effectiveness or use of the map
whatsoever it's literally just a stain
Wow this strangely reminds me of
something I have to repeat in every
single one of my videos anyways so I
filled up the rest of my top coated DIY
water marble decals and I realized I
only use shimmer polish I thought about
putting
follow-on it though I really did I
really thought about it but I decided to
probably cover up the water marble
looking design which was kind of the
point of this video so I didn't want to
take away from that okay I prepped my
nail first with some peel off base
because how you always lose it that's
why and I went to look at all of the
scissors that you guys have sent me to
my P o box and I'm so grateful that you
want me to be Russian so bad thank you
so much now that I have like six pairs
of Russian scissors no one needs to send
me anymore please keep them for yourself
so you can do this I just chopped out a
nice-looking square that's gonna fit
right on my mail that I rounded it cuz I
wanted it to perfectly fit on my nail
like I see Sveta doing all the time how
does she get it so perfect every single
time you're gonna need a base coat or a
nail polish whatever anything to make
your nail a little bit sticky before
putting on the deagle and just start
pushing down on it with the rubber
cuticle pusher or whatever tool you can
find did we forget what's on my other
hand oh shit look what's on my other
hand it's a bunch of random hollows
because my hand went a little crazy this
will all be explained in a future video
I swear it will make sense later just
not now now I just look crazy it's fine
so you're supposed to press down on the
decal and kind of like spread it out so
it fits your nail but look how curved my
nails are and the decal does not want to
fit on the seeker I guess this is one of
those times that having a really strong
C curve really sucks but never mind that
why did no one warned me that using the
Russian scissors and cutting this close
to your cuticle is really scary I feel
like I'm gonna cut my skin off yeah so
I'm mad struggling to get this to fit my
nail right now who knew this would be
the hard part
no new another trick to putting on
decals I've seen people do is just take
a cleanup brush dip it in acetone and
then use it to kind of push down around
the edges
of the decode that way the Polish kind
of sinks into and founds down to the
male if that makes any sense I'm still
having difficulties smoothing us out
though because my nail is soaker when
you've messed with the deagle enough and
managed to get it to fit on your nail
add a glossy top coat and now you're
done and ready to go be friends with
Sveta and you can also go break to all
your friends about the awesome water
marble you just did on your nails even
though you won't have these water at all
but a quick reminder to anyone who can
actually water marble please try out
that create and contained circle water
marble thing I did and turn it into a
decal I really want to know if it works
because my evaluation of it can't be
trusted alright alright I hope you
enjoyed how to cheat at water marbling
part 2 and stay tuned for part 3 that's
right this is gonna be another part of
this thanks so much for watching then
I'll see y'all in about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
