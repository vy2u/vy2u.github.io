and if you know any struggles of being a
nail artist it's the struggle of trying
to water marble in that goddamn cup and
because no one likes pain and suffering
I decided to give you guys some tricks
so you've seen how to cheat a water
marbling part one and then part two if
you haven't go watch them you have a lot
of fun in them but it's now time for a
third new pole technique in how to cheat
at water marble art three step it on
your nails use a stamping plate I got
this one from bundle monster and it has
eight different water marble inspired
images but first you got to learn how to
stamp so you can go watch my how not to
stamp video and then not do that and
then you'll know how to stamp I'm going
to do two different looks for you guys
using this plate we're gonna start off
with a relatively simple one simply a
logical and so I started off with my
favorite white polish as a base I put
the link below on where to find that so
I could have the freedom to add whatever
colors I wanted freedom so this is plate
B M XL to ten by bundle monster I put
the direct link down below for you so
it's easier to find and you can use my
code simply for 10% off anything you
order from bundle monster so next you're
going to need some stamping polishes and
ever since figuring out stamping I
actually learned something and decided
that this big sticky squishy Stamper is
my favorite kind of Stanford before we
stamp on our nail I'm going to protect
my skin with some simply peel I put the
link down below for that too it only
takes maybe two to three minutes to dry
so you can go ahead and get stamping now
I'm gonna try something that's
definitely out of my league but I really
want to try it anyways and that's
gradient stamping so when you have two
or more colors down on your plate you
take a credit card type thing and swipe
the plate you roll that Stamper over the
image and oh yeah a deed must act
quickly though you have probably five or
ten seconds to roll the wet stamping
polish from the Stamper onto your nail
and now it's time to peel off simply
feel like no big deal oh how I miss
saying that you have any random
stragglers I found it was pretty easy to
just pick them off or you could use a
cleanup brush with some acetone let's do
it again because I am so proud of myself
for not only stamping properly but also
doing a gradient stamp don't forget to
clean your plates with acetone in
between stamping sessions oh hey look
what's on my other hand it's a really
boring Essie polish that I talked about
in my two hundred dollar nail polish
what the book video that's right this
nail polish may or may not have been
worth two hundred dollars at one point
go out to my video and you'll understand
okay let's keep going cuz this is so
much fun and I'm so good at this right
now yeah good job me peel it off yeah
I feel so good yeah
and now you're done so all you got to do
is add a glossy top coat so that was
easy AF look I didn't swear
nine-year-olds are you happy now I'm
just fucking with you I'm so gonna swear
because I am 27 years old I am NOT 9 -
all the children who asked me to stop
swearing on my own channel please go ask
your parents to supervise you online and
also my youtube channel is the least of
your special snowflake worries I mean
have you seen best 4 or redtube not
something to go there but just saying
that worse things than my videos exist
now if you're still uncomfortable with
my use of swear words and some of them
are even sceptered then that's totally
fine because bad words are subjective
what's appropriate for me may not be
appropriate for you YouTube videos do
not revolve around you and your personal
comfort zone okay and if you're under 13
how the hell do you even have a youtube
account in order to leave comments
legally you're supposed to be 13 to have
a youtube account so who's in trouble
now and there's plenty of other happy
and safe malar channels that you can go
watch instead shout out to cutepolish
now here's some porn filled porn that is
yeah you guys like seeing this for some
reason you're a bunch of freaks okay now
it's time to cheat yet again at water
marbling but this time with a different
stamping plate pattern you're gonna need
a silicon nail art mat I'm using the
miracle mat I put the links below a
bundle Mansour also sells one called the
Lotus mat so you can check that out as
well if you want but do what's on my
other hand it's so delicate and feminine
what's going on today I'm squirting a
combo of a beautiful pastel neon
turquoise aqua blue topped with
iridescent unicorn dandruff look at that
beautiful shifty shifty Ness
but the links for these polishes in this
Haring down in the video description box
below you'll get back to what we were
doing so now I'm going to use a black
bundle monster stamping polish and I'm
going to use the same squishy Stamper
because I love it so much it's so sticky
and squishy and satisfying and I'm going
to use the heart looking water marble
because Valentine's Day is coming up and
I need to buy been a present tool your
Stamper over that water marble heat and
then you're going to roll your Stamper
on the mat over top of a quick dry top
coat that you applied earlier but I just
didn't mention because I was talking
about something else and do it again and
again and again and again because you
have five nails I maybe you should do a
10times because you probably have ten
nails that you paint so what I'm going
to do now is called reverse stamping or
advanced stamping and I'm going to use a
tiny tiny dotting tool I got from bundle
monster to fill in the spaces of my
stamp for whatever colors of nail polish
you want to use on your mat I'm putting
mine in the create and contain circles
hey has anyone tried that water marble
trick in the circles yet and then you
just take your tiny dotting tool and
start filling in the shapes as you wish
you going with a red and pink color
scheme here because that's Valentine's
eat ish I ended up skipping adding the
pink on the decal on the bath oh because
it ended up being kind of redundant
you'll see why soon before peeling it up
I have seen people put another quick to
our top coat down and then peel it up
but I was kind of curious to see if it
would just come up without doing that
extra step and it did it came up fine
but just out of curiosity I did add a
quick dry top coat over top of a
different nickel just to see if it would
peel up any different and they peeled up
the same naturally this one would be a
little bit thicker though but I found
that doesn't really matter so I know you
think my deagles were messy but the
trick is once you turn the deagle around
you see more of the black so you color
it in the lines and it should look a
little better except I'm not that good
of coloring in the lines apparently but
before I put these on my nails I want to
show you a second way to do the exact
same thing I just did but without
needing a mat in case some of you out
there don't have a mat you can do it
directly on the Stamper I found that it
was a bit easier to take the Stamper
head out of the stamping thing and put
down on the math well on a card and then
on the map because it'll make the
silicon bubble and this way you can
still rest your hand on the table rather
than painting in mid-air unlike what I
did before where I left some space is
clear you can just fill in all the
spaces with exactly the colors you want
to appear on your nail just wanted to
show you a few different ways to do the
exact things because there's so much
cheating going on on this channel
unlike the DIY decals on the mat for
this one you have to add a quick dry top
coat over top of the stamp or else it
won't be able to pull off in one piece I
found it dried pretty quickly maybe in
15 minutes or so and then when it's dry
you just take some tweezers and peel it
off it's where I used to be better at
coloring in the lines when I was little
now back to my actual nails you're gonna
want to paint those I'm painting my pink
because I wanted it to be black and pink
and red and then you're going to need
some tiny Russian scissors to cut up the
decals and I have six tiny Russian
scissors thanks to my hollow sexuals
from around the world at first you can
kind of just guesstimate how big your
nail is and just at least cut the decal
out into some size that make sense
to potentially put on your nail I'm just
testing it out for size right now I'm
not actually putting it on the nail and
so the pink polish underneath was pretty
dry when I did this but just a tiny bit
tacky so it could stick and let me see
what I was doing cut up your decal just
a bit more if you need to and then I'm
going to add a very thin coat of quick
dry top coat I realize now that adding a
quick dry top coat to your nail as
opposed to a fresh coat of polish is
actually better for sticking on a tickle
because that way the color pink won't
get all smushed up as I try and maneuver
this
stupid nail cuz my nails so curved it
makes things so challenging you can use
a plastic tip cuticle pusher or just use
your finger to smooth down the decal on
your nail and then take your tiny
Russian scissors and cut as required and
this cleanup brush dipped in acetone
trick is definitely a must if the edges
aren't going on smooth you're basically
melting the decal into the Polish layer
underneath which is what you want to do
to make it all one thing once you fit
and smoothed out the decal as much as
possible to your nail add a really thick
coat of glossy top coat Wow
beautiful guys look at that it's love
staring into your eyes I honestly
thought I would never get this far with
stamping because I struggled so much
when I first tried it but look at this
guys I am basically related to Sveta and
yo gala just sayin but it can't be love
if there's no Hollow
yeah I had to add a hollow topcoat I'm
sorry I couldn't help myself but now
we've got rainbow heart what is love
hollow don't hurt me
don't have me no more okay I think I've
inhaled enough acetone today please
remember to subscribe to my channel
because there may or may not be a perk
for thanks so much for watching and see
y'all holla sexual later ba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
