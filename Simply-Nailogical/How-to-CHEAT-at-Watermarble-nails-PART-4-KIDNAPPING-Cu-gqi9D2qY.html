you're wondering why my face is in this
video after all this is a nail tutorial
not a face tutorial and that would be a
good question I don't know I just
decided to put my face in it just so
we're clear we're all here today you
everyone out there because we hate
watermark Elaine well I suppose we
secretly love them but we hate
everything involved with doing them and
attempting it and the frustrations
behind the water marble is real we don't
even want to put ourselves through that
any more because that's called self
torture and we value our self esteem and
self worth more than that
and we also believe that anyone who can
do water marbling successfully in a cup
is a witch who shall be burned or drown
in the water marble cup how fitting so
by now you've seen how to cheat at water
marbling parts one two and three and if
you haven't then you should probably
watch them before this video because
this video is part 4 and if you know how
to count then you know which order to
watch them in part 1 part 2 part 3 I
always wonder how youtubers do this so
perfectly like how do they know in
advance where the stuff they're gonna
put on the screen is going to show up
how do they know that my face is
probably covered by a thumbnail right
now lots of people have been asking me
to do newspaper nails and I'm over here
like hello I do not read the newspaper
oh I read the news just not on a piece
of paper because I have this really
great invention called a cell phone and
also a computer and a laptop
occasionally I will come across someone
who is a very avid social media user and
like knows their stuff when it comes to
technology but then they read the
newspaper and I'm like that literally
makes no sense what are you doing why
let's challenge our brains a little and
use technology to be smart to do our
nails okay we're going to be smart yes
yeah now I know there's lots of witches
out there who can water marble
successfully because I've seen evidence
of this time and time again on the
Internet's
I see all those beautiful designs done
those demonic cups of water and what
kind of
wanna take their head and put it in the
water drama John the broom bad shot
right
no violence Christine no violence stop
with the violence so then I thought what
if I just take a picture of someone
else's water marble in the cup and put
it on my nails why did no one think of
this before I don't know smarty that's
the Canadian saying they have a smart
heart step one while on the internet
locate videos or photos of desired water
marble patterns on the cup as performed
by witches Sveta Sanders - Cala my
simple little pleasures all your water
marbles will be mine
how does she even do that which step to
print off those water marble patterns on
plain white paper using a colored ink
printer so man she's not friends with
the printer apparently well at least
it's not my good hand man gee I guess
maybe you shouldn't include your cat
when you try this at home
step 3 cut out your stolen water marble
prints with scissors to fit the size of
your nail ha ha ha ha
step 4 paint your nails with a creamy
white nail polish perfect in one
actually easy coat step 5
get a cup you don't mind ruining because
we're going to pour some alcohol in it
not that kind of alcohol you drunk
people rubbing alcohol cut the cup so
it's shallow enough to dip your finger
in and pour in the alcohol don't drink
it though
step 6 dip your nail into the cup of
rubbing alcohol I'm okay with this
because there's no nail polish in this
stuff
step 7 work quickly and apply the stolen
water marble print to your wet nail with
the ink side facing down hold it down
for 20 seconds honestly this is probably
the best water marble cheat of them all
stealing is great and finally step 8
peel back the paper to reveal your
genius stolen water marble nails well
how did this not work I don't understand
Google said that this works well I do
make Google shame so much shame the only
thing left to do I suppose to get that
true water marble witchcraft is to
kidnap a witch now where can I find the
best witch I can I might as well make
the most of this kidnap so I should
probably find someone who can water
marble can also drag marble and a whole
bunch of other things gone kidnap a
witch go on a kidnap a witch witch witch
witch witch witch gonna Russia so we're
here in Russia this is Russia oh it's
cold and I just saw Lenin's tomb it was
interesting the Kremlin's over there and
I just doc Sveta online and
all right let's go look that's my look
tea water marble I know you seek water
marble do it go and that's how you cheat
a water marble it's really quite simple
okay everyone I thank you all so much
for tuning into my accidental how to
cheat at water marbling miniseries and I
sincerely hope that if you're a water
marble cheater like myself that you try
out all four methods and see which one
works best for you and just be confident

actually water marble to achieve life
