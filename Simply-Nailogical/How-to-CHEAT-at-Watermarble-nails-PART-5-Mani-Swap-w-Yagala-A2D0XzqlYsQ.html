art thief hey guys what's up hello hallo
everyone and guess what looks like I
finally broke the water marble code
that's right bitch okay so if you're new
here let me break it down for you for
decades and decades I have struggled to
achieve the water marble perfection on
my nails well let's not be dramatic it
was more like several months
disenchanted by my repeated water marble
failures I set out to break the water
marble code by cheating at it I've been
through so many water marble witch hunts
I failed at dipping the fingers in the
water thing found refuge with nail
vinyls drag marbled myself to a fallacy
of redemption damp the fuck out of water
marbles and kidnapped a Russian and then
I also forced my boyfriend to unlock the
powers of water marble and he actually
did it and then I was like well my life
and now it's time that I reveal to you
my next secret in how to cheat a water
marble park
I am kind of an obsessive person welcome
to my channel please subscribe it took
me a really long time to figure out but
I used a printer and I cheated
okay so full disclosure I stole this
water marble from a Russian obviously
you guys know yeah gala right well we
decided to make a Manny swap out of my
staff so I didn't feel as bad about the
crime I committed me and yeah gala go
way back
anyone remember shit nail artist say
this was her and this was me
and now here we are now I have four nail
polish shelves Galina
that's your yellows real name told me
that she was gonna try and speak some
English in her video which you can go
check out I put the link below so I
thought well I should probably try and
speak some Russian in this video to be
fair oh okay let me try this don't laugh
for bear Kiva yeah nyah a nice idea what
that sounds like Japanese I can't
pronounce this right let me try again
for pelvic Jana nice Enya shaloo shit Co
Basso vocal Bukhari Tia taxco Yahoo GU
so granny's sloppy Lee's Saxony you beat
yeah how'd I do on my way to being
Russian excellent great you gotta paint
your nails why because we're gonna put
colors on white and color show up over
white yay English look at that one coat
wonder like what this is my favorite
white but you got to apply it like a
mastered skill polish a plier and have a
little patience the next step is the fun
step it's the stealing step you're going
to go to youtube or whatever tube no
just just just YouTube just YouTube kids
and you're going to find a picture of
water marble that you really like that
you want to steal ironically enough a
lot of the things that come up when I
search water marble are my videos on how
to cheat it well that's not very helpful
is it okay I'm just going to search for
a gallows page because I already know
that I want to steal one
first here we go yes I want that on my
nails and guess what I'm gonna get it on
my nails bitch so find the part in the
video where that witchcraft shit is
happening in the cup try and find the
perfect moment to pause the video the
stupid bar is in the way then you're
just going to zoom in as much as you can
with your mouse thingy or whatever and
then take a screenshot and you're going
to copy that screenshot onto a Word
document or something else you can print
and as you can see I am doing a lot of
proper measurements about how to size it
to my nails yes these are very proper
this is a good way of doing it next
you're going to get some clear
waterslide decal paper that's made for
inkjet printers I know what a mouthful I
did some research to try and figure out
which kind of decal paper was best for
nails because some of them are a little
too thick and I ended up getting these
ones off Amazon I'll put a link to the
exact ones I bought down below in the
video description box and I got to hand
it to Becky who left me this comment a
couple months ago I think she knew what
I was trying to do and I had a cheat at
water marble part 4 video that turned
into a kidnapping crime so thank you
Becky my printer is not dirty at all I
cleaned the house all the time
okay so then you're gonna print your
stolen water marble on your decal paper
make sure you have it facing the right
side in your printer and bam you're
going to pop that stolen water marble
baby out of that printer except this is
taking a really long time one mistake
that I did make that I want to share
with you guys is that the first time I
printed the stolen water marble I just
printed it at whatever default quality
setting and yeah it was really granular
and it didn't really print that nice so
I printed it again and this time made
sure to change my printer settings to
best quality and set it on glossy paper
I don't know what that does but it makes
it better see I told you this tutorial
would be somewhat helpful next you're
going to get a glossy taco wait no
that's not what you're getting not at
all you're getting clear nail polish not
a topcoat and you're gonna cover that
entire sole in water marble in a clear
polish now during my research I did find
that the internet was suggesting I spray
my decal with a clear coat they meant a
clear coat in a spray can meant for I
don't know like outdoor wood furniture
what do people use this stuff for but
I'm not a fan of spraying liquids
everywhere so I decided to use this
clear nail polish and I'm happy to
report that it worked perfectly the
reason why I didn't use a regular quick
dry top coat is because I'd heard make
the decal shrink so I used a clear nail
polish so that hopefully that didn't
happen you don't need to cover
everything you printed just the parts of
the design that you think you're gonna
put on your nail and oh what's that on
my other hand so sparkly and pretty and
kind of elegant but also hollow at the
same time it's a formula x polish and I
got it from Sephora because where else
do they sell formula X do they sell
pharmanex anywhere else I'm not sure
funny story when I first heard formula X
I thought it was a sex tape and then I
found out it was nail polish and I loved
it immediately back to the water marble
cheating gonna take some tiny Russian
scissors how fitting and cut out the
bulk of your design and here you can
kind of guesstimate how big each little
piece needs to be to fit your nail but
definitely cut them out so they're
bigger than your nail and then you can
cut them down to size later then you gon
drop them in couple water oh I just got
haunted by my boyfriend's exceptional
water marbling skill set
continue boycotting the water marble
rituals by throwing your stolen water
marble designs into a cup of water
ground water marble bitches drown drew
I'm finally getting my wish now I
thought the next step is going to take
like at least a minute but it happened
pretty much immediately the deagle
started separating super easily from the
paper flatback singing and bam there's
your water marble decal that was easy so
I was surprised by how easy that was and
I wasn't expecting that to work out very
well so I just started putting them down
on my nail art mask for now okay now
here's the last step which is probably
the most challenging part because so far
this was all so easy I know you can
thank me later essentially you need to
trim it down to fit your nail kinda like
a nail wrap except you got to do the
work cutting out the wrap I found that
it was really easy to manipulate the
water decal because it was still wet and
it was kind of malleable and flexible so
just take your tiny Russian scissors and
be really careful try not to cut your
skin oh my god is always my worst
nightmare and ever so gently cut around
your nail do these colourful plastic
flexible things remind anyone of fruit
roll-ups mmm delicious childhood
breakfast memories so you don't have to
trim down the deco all the way to your
nail leave like a tiny bit around all
the edges but I'll show you why later it
was probably a better idea to leave even
a little bit more anyways you'll see
next you're gonna remove your decal that
you've just custom shaped to your nail
see it's not stealing if I made it
custom fit for me then you're going to
take some clear nail polish or topcoat
doesn't really matter I just used the
clear polish because it was lying around
slap it on your nail and use that to
adhere the water marble on to your nail
press down the water marble decal slowly
and spread it out carefully so you don't
get any air bubbles singing now normally
I complain all the time about my nails
being so curved and being unable to
press down decals or anything flat on my
super curved nails but these decals
actually hug the curves of my nails
super well I guess you could say this
decal paper is really flexible once it
gets a little wet the next step is to
take a cleanup brush dip it in a honey
percent acetone and then use it to press
down on the edges of the design to seal
it in around your nail using the acetone
is key because it helps to dissolve the
decal a little bit and that's what you
want to do is dissolve it into your nail
basically that sounds bad but it's
actually not a problem at all and I'm
doing the same thing around the sides of
my nail in my cuticle and finally you're
gonna add a nice thick glossy taco
because you're getting hungry also
because you want to conceal the fact
that you printed up this design and
stuck it on your nails jst Alero sukhiya
Lezama
water marble Kogut or even nemo steady
astana vite menya seichas wise water
marble water marble and russian that's
my only question but yeah so basically
what i wanted to say was fuck you water
marble if you weren't sure this is my
middle finger I'm giving it to all the
people who can water marble in a cup so
you can tell up close a little just a
lead hole that it's printed but blame
that on my crappy printer remember when
I mentioned that I thought top coat
would shrink the water marbles you go
well it did shrank the water marble
decal after I'd already applied it on my
nails so now you can learn from my
experiences and know that you need to
leave a little extra room on the decal
around your nail before you apply a
topcoat because the top coat is going to
shrink the deagle that's right I'm still
saying decal like the way you guys like
to hear me say words alright let's get
real these nails are great and all but I
am distracted by the background because
Hollow time to put a hollow taco on my
nails yes of course
Christy keen can't go a tutorial without
doing this now you know you're an addict
when beautiful just beautiful committed
like a true criminal the neons haven't
really been showing that well under all
the lights so I change to lighter on for
you guys so you can get to enjoy the
neon
yeah look at that superb right in your
face bitch a stolid bitch and that
concludes my how to cheat a water marble
part 5 who could say I'm an expert in
this make sure to go show you a gala
some love for her actual water marbling
skills go subscribe to her youtube
channel and check her out on instagram
that's where she slays the nail art
world and I just want to stress real
quick before I sign off here if you're
gonna steal someone's water marble print
it and put it on your nails you should
probably give them credit for coming up
with the water marble design in the
firstly after all they are witches and
they can probably cast a spell on you or
kill you so you better be careful also
because giving credit as to where you
got your ideas is a good thing to do as
a human yes do it do it thanks so much
for watching and I'll see y'all later
