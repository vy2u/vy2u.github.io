we're gonna get naked and stay naked for
the entire video and also file our nails
now before I go on I need to stop some
ignorant in its tracks and acknowledge
that yes I'm very aware that my nails
are yellow and I've already made another
video on why my nails are yellow and why
it doesn't matter it sucks that I
basically have to repeat myself in all
my videos but some people never learn
back on topic lots of people ask me how
I files last shape my nails but before I
show you how I need to explain how a lot
of the shape of your nail bed like how
wide or narrow or long this part of your
nail is you can't actually change you're
born with whatever size nail bed you
have and that's it you can't change well
you're not born with it like a baby and
then your nails stay the same size they
were when you were a baby but you get
what I'm saying hopefully you also can't
change the natural curve of your nails
some people call this the C curve that
probably stands for the Christine curve
because as you can see my nails have a
very strong curve basically it's how
flat or curves your nails are if you
look at them from this angle you also
can't change any natural warping of your
C curve or your nails so for example
when my nails get really long like they
are right now my C curve gets tighter
and the left side of the curve of my
middle nail pulls in more if you have
super tight C curves like me then using
nail oil regularly will help soften that
curve when it gets too tight I put the
link down below for my favorite nail oil
a strong C curve isn't necessarily a bad
or good thing some people like the way
it looks and some people prefer flatter
nails a strong C curve is really only a
problem when your nails get too long and
they start to curve too much in words
and therefore risk breaking easier or if
they're digging into the sides of your
finger that can hurt overall just know
that it's actually quite normal to have
wonky or weirdly warped nails we just
all have naturally different shaped nail
beds that we can't change
we just got to live with it and deal
with it after all we're not born with
perfect symmetry and less you're Russian
of course then you're born with perfect
nails and the rest of us hate you
bla bla bla bla bla okay now for what
you can change is the shape of the free
edge of your nail and we're gonna do
just that but I didn't even mention look
what's on my other end of my guns the
prettiest baby olive blue ever like a
unicorn sat on a robin's egg and this
was hatched there are so many different
nail shapes out there you go wild with
different nail shape one nail shape
isn't better than another it's just
completely about personal preference
unless you have bubble nails that's just
stupid
according to my number one trusted
online source for all things nail health
slash nail care I put the link below
usually the most flattering nail shape
is the one that mirrors your cuticle
line my cuticle lines are rounded but
they're kind of square at the same time
and it just so happens that I like to
shape my nails as rounded squares or
squirrels as some people call them okay
let's do this I'm gonna go from this to
this it's not that much shorter I know
okay but I still like my nails kinda
long for nail art first things first
do not cut your nails don't use nail
clippers or scissors because you'll risk
splitting the nail and drinking it in
places you don't want it to break run
away from the Clippers they are evil if
you cut or clip your nails because
you're too impatient to file them then
I'm gonna guess you haven't tried a
glass file yet glass nail files are way
quicker at filing down the nail with the
right amount of pressure and they also
leave cleaner edges than your regular
course Emery boards I use this glass one
and I got it from my favorite nail care
shop I put the link below again now this
is how you should actually file them
file in one direction from corner to
Center here oh my good she said one
direction contrary to popular belief do
not file straight across in a seesaw
motion doing that will put a lot of
pressure on your nail and the filing
back and forth motion will pull your
nail from side to side remember that
your nail tips are the driest part of
your nail and if you file straight
across back and forth you risk splitting
the ends if you ever find that your
nails are catching on something like a
sweater or even
your hair then it's probably because you
had a free edge whether at the top or
the side of your nail that had a tiny
split even if it's just a hairline split
you don't notice yet but it could
develop into a bigger slip kinda like a
chip in your car windshield
oh you don't drive yet cuz you're 12
okay well you'll understand one day file
the sides but only if you need to
obviously if your nails are too short
for this then you don't need to do this
in fact you really don't need and
shouldn't file the size of your nails
unless a you have a very strong C curve
like I do my nails will actually dig
into the sides of my skin and that can
even hurt filing them helps soften that
C curve or B you have wide nails that
flare out at the top and so you would
file the very top of the sides to make
them more rectangular I think it's
obvious but maybe I should also point
out that you're not filing down into
your skin or anything this is only the
part of the nail that is naturally
lifted or exposed now I'm going back to
filing down the tip of my nails again
filing in one direction oh my god she
said one direction again from corner to
center because a glass file can really
take off a lot in one stroke make sure
to stop every few strokes and assess the
length and evenness of your nails so you
don't make them shorter than intended or
make them uneven when I'm getting close
to done I flip my hands over so I can
gently scrape or push out the filing
scrag lers from the underside of my nail
you may have less of this nail shavings
collector effect going on if your nails
are flatter and less curved than mine so
once you push them upwards then you just
turn your nails around and you can kind
of file the little shavings off so now
you're done with your glass file so you
can put that away but you may still have
a tiny bit of unevenness and fine tuning
to do so next I actually use this random
nail buffer I have but I don't use it to
buff the top of my nails don't do that
unless you want to weaken the layers of
your nails don't buff your nails but
rather because the nail buffer has a
super high grit I use it to refine the
edges of my nails with a lot more
control since it's definitely not going
to be filing anything down and a
can't weigh like the glass file this is
when I round out the corners just a bit
into a squirrel Ville shape since this
is the kind of nail shape that works
best for me both practically and
aesthetically in my opinion I've tried
super square nails before but I found
that the sharp corners were always
snagging on things and breaking and also
sometimes digging into the side of my
skin and I'm a baby I don't need that
unnecessary pain and then you're done
really just go wash off your hands of
all the nail shavings at this point some
people have asked me what the little
dents in my nails are and it's because
I'm a butcher and always use this metal
tool when I'm taking off my polish with
the peel-off base coat I mean I did that
thirty-two times for you guys when I
made these peel-off videos so I should
probably stop using the metal tool I
keep meaning to find a wooden stick
thing but I can't find them in the store
that's under my building and uh laziness
anyways the dents are so shallow that
you don't even see them through polish
so I don't really care because just like
yellow nails I cover them up anyways now
on the topic of general nail care I know
the last nail care video I made his
super old but honestly I still use
mostly the same thing the key is oil oil
and more oil I put a link to my favorite
nail care oil and a bunch of other
articles that I read and trust with my
life and my nails on all sorts of topics
below like how to keep your nails from
breaking how to keep polish on and stop
chipping and all sorts of
mythbusters-style articles like do nails
need to breathe is acetone a safe nail
polish remover and whether strengtheners
actually help or harm your nails hint
they harm them go read the article so
you may have a little reading to do and
I know that's asking a lot from a person
who watches YouTube videos but all the
articles I linked are super short and to
the point because people need the
knowledge about the nails and about the
filing of the nails so now you take this
knowledge that you've retrieved from
this video and you please in your head
you keep it in your head and you use it
when you do your nails
thanks so much for watching and
listening and retaining information see
y'all later bye
