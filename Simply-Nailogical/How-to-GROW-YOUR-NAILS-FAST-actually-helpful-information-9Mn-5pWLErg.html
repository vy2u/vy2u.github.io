there right now with hacks or gimmicky
buds that will tell you to do all sorts
of crazy things to make your nails grow
like rub garlic on your nails I've seen
salt just put your nails in water and
just a bunch of drugs into your body
grow your nails overnight in a week grow
your nails fast now what is it what does
fast mean though you cannot grow your
nails a meaningful length fast it's just
scientifically doesn't make sense so in
my opinion I am typically a person who
doesn't believe pretty much anything an
infomercial will tell you I think a lot
of things are is what I'm
trying to say here's what we know fam
different people's nails will grow at
different speeds there's just so many
factors external and internal body can't
that can contribute to the speed at
which your nails grow and I would just
like to clarify that I'm not a nail
expert I'm just a nail obsessed person
I'm not a doctor so I would not be
qualified or able to tell you if you
have any vitamin or nutritional
deficiencies then I contribute to slower
nail growth or to sweep your nails over
that is something that happens some
people do have major nails and it could
be a result of vintage chip so if you
think that that's you then I would
recommend that you talk to your doctor
about oh now that that disclaimer is out
of the way as you can see I've got
receipts in the form of long ass nails
so in my own experience you gonna learn
some today this is gonna be a long
video yep here's the case study I broke
my middle star tutorial nail On January
28th 2017 terrible way to start off the
year I know because the brake was so low
in my nail bed it would have been way
too painful to cut it all the way down
there so I filed it down a bit and then
patched it up temporarily you can see
how I did that in my my life is over
fixing my broken nail video talk about
dramatic youtubers I then let it grow
out with the patch for about another
month and a half and then towards the
end of March in my I'm moving on life
update update video I could finally
sever off the broken part of myself was
time to start over my friends I filed
down all of my nails so the middle one
didn't have to grow through the hard
times by herself grow through get it
okay I'm moving on then we were starting
from zero I took a picture of my nails
every single week for five months what
do you mean it wasn't overnight yes
that's how long it took me to grow my
nails so let's watch that time-lapse
again while I shut up because it was
just so fascinating
sidenote if you're new here and
wondering why my nails are yellow it's
because I wear a lot of dark pigment and
nail polish I don't often wear base
coats designed to prevent staining
because I were a peel off base coat
instead I don't bleach or whiten my
nails and I never use a buffer to shave
off the stain because that just
weakens your nails the color or stain of
your nails doesn't actually matter
doesn't affect the strength of your
nails unless of course the yellowing is
a sign of another health problem which
is not the case with me because you see
it's not yellow right near the cuticle
where the nails growing out I've just
accepted that I would rather strong
yellow nails than weaker white nails
that have suffered through bleaching and
buffing kind of looks like Donald Trump
upside down haha by the end of the 5
months I measured two point one
centimeters and at the beginning I don't
know how much I measured because I'm an
idiot and forgot to do this but thanks
to the power of editing I'm just gonna
superimpose one picture on top of the
other and from this we can deduce that
my nail growth journey started out at
1.4 centimeters on the middle nail which
means the total growth of 0.7
centimeters in 161 days which is a
growth rate of about 1.4 millimeters a
month that's about half as slow as what
Google says snails grow in a month so
either my nails grow abnormally slow or
the top information on Google is based
on fake news to be fair I did do some
minor filing over the five months just
to keep the nails even but Christine I
can wait four months and my nails keep
breaking all month think about what you
were doing the last time you broke a
nail something with your hands I'm
guessing the last time I had a serious
help break I was trying to lift a desk
I should have had been move the desk for
me there are many things in life that we
do that can cause our nails to break so
you can either just not do them or you
can try and find another way to get the
task done for example don't open
packages with your nails
that's what knives are for don't open
cupboards with your nails do use your
knuckle or another part of your hand to
open the cupboard instead got an
eco-friendly toilet like I do don't
press down on that danger button with
your males use another object to press
it down instead how about this lint
roller sure I mean I did ask men'she to
push it but she was too busy trying to
swim in the toilet don't open that pop
can with your nails use a spoon can't
break those nails I need them to scratch
Mickey do you want your nails to die use
a random object to split the edge of the
keychain and then start rolling in the
other keychain don't wash makeup brushes
okay no if you have to have your hands
underwater for long periods of time like
when you're washing makeup brushes or
doing the dishes I just never did the
dishes so that wasn't gonna be an
example make sure to always wear rubber
gloves and protect your nails from
unnecessary drowning in water
you're still gonna hate cleaning those
 makeup brushes though don't use
your nails to press buttons in life do
use your knuckles give me knocks bro
give me next and if you must use your
nails to do things in life but are
afraid of breaking your nail
why not use your other
yes I know this may be silly if you care
about the nails on both your hands
equally but everyone has a favorite it's
not lost on me that I'm basically
suggesting that you just do less in your
life if you don't want to break your
name but honestly that's just the truth
the less you put your nails at risk of
breaking the less they're gonna break
there's also some proactive measures you
can take to help reduce the risk of
breaking do the voice-over always wear
nail polish that's right keeping nail
polish on can actually help prevent a
nail break because it adds an extra
layer of protection
kinda like a splint to the surface of
your nail naked nails equals break-in
males
know it's not just me trying to Ford my
pro nail polish agenda wearing nail
polish all the time in combination with
some other factors we'll talk about next
can really help reduce the risk of
breaking your nail and if you go to a
school where you're not allowed to wear
colored nail polish just wear a clear
nail polish or a glossy taco by itself
or a matte taco so that at least your
nails have something on them nail polish
also helps lock good oil into your nails
and keep water out of your nails more on
both of those next never shower naked
yes that sounds like it makes no sense
doesn't it because when you shower you
get deaf now
elzar stop to flatten just like duck
smells there's a danger oh to find you
there's a no break right behind you what
to do be careful with your water can
actually make your nails quite weak when
they're super soaked and wet let me show
you like getting naked just after a
shower the nails get flatter because
they're flooded with water when your
nails are super wet like this they're at
a high risk of breaking so you best be
very careful with those duck nails after
a shower one thing you can do to help
keep water out of your nails is the same
as the last tip always wear nail polish
and make sure the tips of your nails are
wrapped with the polish I have another
more detailed video on that so basically
don't shower low jk don't shower with
naked nails use nail oil all the damn
time this helps keep your nails flexible
so that if you do things in life with
your hands and your nail was at risk of
breaking and snapping it may just flex
instead of snap some nail flex is good
flex this has saved me more than a few
times where I was positive that my nail
broke because of the pain I felt in my
finger but upon inspection it was
perfectly fine it just bent but didn't
crack I made a video on that a while
back obviously I can't guarantee your
nails are never gonna break if you use
nail oil sometimes just happens I
personally think the oil has saved me
more than once and helps my nails stay
both strong but resilient at the same
time - snapping what kind of nail oil
you ask not all oils are created equally
you should look for one that has jojoba
oil in it or jojoba where how are the
 you want to pronounce this but in
fact it doesn't even have to say nail
oil it just has to say jojoba oil
preferably 100% or pure jojoba oil
because jojoba is the oil that is most
similar to the oil our body's produced
natural which means it can absorb
through your nail plate better than say
vegetable oil which would just sit on
top of your nail yes other oils like
coconut oil olive oil apricot oil and
whatever and have great skin and cuticle
benefits but based on my personal
research and viewpoint those kinds of
oils don't do much for your actual nail
I decided to experiment
and buy large bottles of pure jojoba
because hey if that's the most important
ingredient then why don't I just get the
100% pure directly from the dealer
right my dealer being Amazon also it's
so much cheaper this way you can get a
giant bottle for like ten to fifteen
dollars when I first tried it out I
thought it was a little bit too liquidy
so I got some vitamin E gel which is
just naturally a little bit thick I mix
them together into a glass bottle
dropper that I also bought off amazon
debt shook and that made the consistency
a lot better for me you could also put
the oil mixture in an empty clean nail
polish bottle and then it's like you're
applying nail polish that's fun or you
can make your own nail oil pen this has
got to be the most convenient way to
apply nail oil and remember to do it
regularly
I bought a ton of these handy pen
applicator contraptions off Aliexpress
because at the time I couldn't find any
on Amazon but now I see some I'll leave
some links to those pens below if you
want and you would just fill up your
pens with the oil from your dropper
bottle snap the pen tip on perfect then
you just turn the bottom of the pen
until some oil comes up this makes
applying the oil a lot less messy and
then you can leave a pen everywhere in
your life so you always remember to do
it in your purse by your computer on
your nightstand even at work or school
once you apply it you just rub it in I
recommend applying the jojoba oil
multiple times daily but even if you
were to just apply it once in the
morning and once before you go to bed I
think you'll see a difference after
regular use sometimes people ask me if
you can put this on while you're wearing
nail polish and the answer is yes you
can't just put it around the edges where
your cuticle meets your nail and don't
forget to put it under your nail so that
the oil has somewhere to absorb into
your nail I just want to add that some
companies who sell and market and oil as
for your nails might try and tell you
that using pure jojoba oil isn't good
enough because well they're trying to
sell their own products so I'm not sure
how much weight we can give to that
statement
I have no stake in jojoba oil there is
no benefit in me telling you guys to buy
pure jojoba I don't own it to Joba plant
or invest in jojoba stock so for almost
a year now I've been using my DIY mix of
pure jojoba and vitamin E Joe and I have
personally found that it's had the same
good strengthening and flexibility
benefits as any other nail oil I've
tried that was sold and marketed as a
nail oil and bonus jojoba oil has
amazing benefits for your cuticles watch
me transform Ben's nasty cuticles I
forced him into letting me apply nail
oil to his nails for a month
haha and look how much better shape his
cuticles are in now you want beautiful
cuticles then you used a Joba oil are
you still here you want some more
information for your brain perfect
because now I'm going to talk about
avoiding nail hardener / strengtheners
common misconception many people think
that nail hardeners are strengtheners
will make your nails grow faster the
truth is that they have no impact on the
growth of your nails now growth has to
come from inside your body a
strengthening base coat will just sit on
top of your nail which is just dead
tissue and it cannot actually promote
growth from within your body so since
these treatments don't promote growth
what do they do they make your nails
hard for most people using a nail
hardener or strengthener can actually be
counterproductive to growing your nails
because it can lead to your nails
snapping and breaking more easily this
used to happen to me so often a few
years ago when I was struggling to grow
my nails out and was using a nail
strengthener as a base coat under every
single manicure thinking that it would
help my nails grow once I stopped using
a nail strengthener my nails stopped
snapping so frequently if you're always
wearing a nail strengthening base coat
and you notice the corner or tips of
your nails are just snapping when you
accidentally knock something it's
probably because your nail is too hard
and it's not getting enough oil to stay
flexible if this is what's happening to
you try skipping the nail hardening
treatments and just use a regular base
coat and of course lots and lots of nail
oil however there is a caveat for some
people if your nails are very thin like
paper a nail strengthener may
temporarily help repair them by giving
them a bit of a boost of hardness if
that makes sense if you have very thin
nails and think a hardener may benefit
you try it under your manicure for a few
weeks but always make sure to use it in
combination with nail oil your nails
will get stronger but also flex when
they need to ultimately I see nail
strengtheners as a temporary solution
for people with extremely thin nails
think of it as a recovery treatment
it's like antibiotics don't take them if
you don't need them because if you do
that then it may cause more harm than
good
so doctors tell me I don't know too
your nails you can't bite your nails I
know that's easier said than done for
some but if you are someone who has had
trouble from stopping yourself from
biting your nails
here's a couple tips try using an anti
nail biting polish which you can find
from your local drugstore or off Amazon
it's basically just clear liquid that
tastes bad with the hopes that you won't
want to put your fingers in your mouth
anymore or you could paint your nails
Hollow because who would want to ruin
such a beautiful manicure not us no or
of course you could put ours in to nail
art that you won't want to ruin nail art
Lowell or bite something else this
sounds stupid but if you've tried
everything and just can't stop you're
biting habits because you really just
want to bite then shift you're
biting onto something other than your
nails yes this is terrible for your
teeth but hey I'm not a dentist I'm just
a youtuber okay
now wanna borrow a pen you could also
just chew gum to keep your mouth busy
it's up to you if you tend to bite your
nails because of dry cuticles or hang
nails make a point to take care of it
properly in this case I've got a piece
of dead skin that I'm gonna carefully
cut off it's important to tend to your
nails properly so that way you can
resist biting them like a goddamn buffet
if you have a tear in your nail bed like
Ben does here and it's constantly
snagging on things which makes you want
to bite it you may need to use some nail
glue and nail repair powder to fix it up
then file it to smooth it out add a base
coat or whatever not a hardening one and
there you go now you won't have a need
to bite it it yay the N putting
vegetables on your nails is also an
option because who wants to eat
vegetables gross and if all else fails
bite someone else's nails and finally
consider what nail length is best for
your lifestyle if you play a lot of
sports or musical instruments super long
nails may not be so realistic
remember that short nails aren't a bad
thing and it can still look really damn
good if you take good care of them it's
all about what works best for you but
hey if you don't do much or you just
work in an office or your student
writing your essays all day then you
could probably get away with long nails
you're just gonna annoy
your neighbors for me I'm at the point
where my main star tutorial hands
tutorial
what tutorials is getting too long where
I am now afraid of it breaking I only
grew them so long for the thumbnail okay
we learned a lot that was too much
information let's do a quick recap class
who would like to go first oh that's
right I'm here alone one nail growth
takes time it's not gonna happen in a
week you're gonna have to wait months if
you want to go from nubs to long ass
nails to don't break your nails I know
that's easier said than done but as I
hopefully demonstrate it to you you got
to slow down and go to think am I gonna
break my nails if I do this okay maybe I
shouldn't do it maybe I get someone else
to do it for me man three always keeps
nail polish on for never shower with
naked nails and be careful when your
nails are wet because when you shower
you get duck nails step 5
use a jojoba based oil all the time to
keep your nails flexible fix for most
people you should try to stay away from
nail hardeners or nail strengthener 7
don't fight your nails
because if you bite them then they're
not gonna grow and finally eight accept
and keep your nails at a reasonable
length that suits your lifestyle not
everyone will be able to live their
daily lives with long ass nails if they
I don't know play soccer or whatever
other sports they use your hands know
soccer is not one of them you get what
I'm saying
growing your nails is kind of like
school if you do your homework every day
and study you will see results over time
there's no foolproof cheat hacks to
getting through school successfully and
there certainly aren't any to long
healthy nails either you got to put the
work in love
simply mom logical and who does your
brain hurt despite how long this video
is I'm sure there are some questions
that I just didn't answer so if you have
another question that you really wish I
answered please write it down below in
the comments I hope that I did this
video justice and
you guys found it helpful if you did
give it a like what do I hate myself so
much for saying that
