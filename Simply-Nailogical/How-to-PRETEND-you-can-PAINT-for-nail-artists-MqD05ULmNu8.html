setting a terrible precedent
everyone's gonna expect me to do weird
things on camera now excuse me while I
drink some Snapple crack drink one
Balance Snapple a day and apples not
even paying me for this do you realize
how annoying it is to put on makeup on
the weekends I just want to chat for a
second about how proud I am of all you
youtubers for your comments on my last
video excuse me well I go off tangent
like all other youtubers talk about a
video for five minutes that you didn't
click on there were less than ten idiots
who commented negative stuff on my
American pride nails video can't say the
same for Instagram I swear every time I
read through my Instagram comments I get
stupider now back to today's video so
many people think that you need to be
creatively endowed and have blessed
artistic fingers from birth in order to
be an amazing nail artist but you never
are right well I got good news for you
fun fact number one half the fun of nail
art it's pretending that you're a
talented snooty artist I got two
techniques to show you today that work
real nice and one nail art design and
I'll show you how you can fake it til
you make it
technique number one painting ever
wonder why it is that some nail artists
can paint the tiniest of details and the
straightest of lines on their nails and
you're just sitting there making a big
mess of your nails thinking but I don't
understand they told me in grade school
that not even great artists could paint
straight lines
your teacher is lied to you now here's
how you can pretend
B&amp;amp;L artists you can actually paint
higher a tiny leprechaun hello there
could you please paint my nails become a
French person in fois cause you're
divvying best con says it's just a way
exhale and a pendulum use only find
those fancy expensive brushes that all
the talent is nail artists used guys I
got the pure color ten and four just
nail 24 dance brush once you buy these
brushes they will give your hands
magical powers and super French
abilities just tell everyone you could
free campaign if you wanted to but that
you prefer to use more abstract methods
to challenge your artistic abilities
because you defy the normal
interpretation of artists so you can
express the deeply conflicted nail
artist inside of you instead of freehand
nails you do more challenging things
like complex gradients the art of the
vinyl and the singular placement of a
colony of glitchers oh wait those are
all my tricks
don't overcomplicate things and try and
paint realistic portraits on your nails
just paint silhouettes this is a
silhouette so is this and this it's easy
enough to just paint an outline of
something and then color it in with
black and you can act all like that's
the effect I was going for it's the art
of the shadow haven't you heard
once you paint your shadow art there's a
toothpick to erase all your mistakes and
shape whatever mess you just drew into
something that makes then technique
number two dry brushing this is one of
those kinds of art where you can
literally make a complete mess of
everything and call it abstract art
meanwhile everyone's like Oh
they are so creative similar to the
concept of ikat nail art where you just
treble and call it art
dry-brushing means painting like a
two-year-old who ran out of paint
pretty sure that's how dry brushing was
invented anyways some French mural
painter was probably like sheet sheet
the guys I lent out the bank and I must
finish painting the King so to preserve
the paint he just filled up the brush
with a tiny bit of paint at a time and
then changed the course of history for
artists everywhere
damn made-up history lesson brought to
you by me now that we've covered two
realistic options and how you can
pretend to paint and actually succeed at
it let's watch an actual nail tutorial
shall we check out these funky nails
this is what you're going to learn to
create I'll be using all the colors of
the rainbow and white polish as always I
use my favorite white polish as a base
coat this was the winner of my white
polish games video you can watch it that
link in the left hand corner
I'm going to apply some simply peel
which is a definite must for all people
pretending to be nail artists because
you can be messy with it
you can't find this stuff in stores guys
you can only find it online I put the
link to my favorite shop below let's
start with art fir two year old this is
what dry brushing looks like my brush is
kind of dry to get your brush like that
just take out the polish brush and wipe
off the excess polish on the edge of the
bottle to get it even drier you can go
crazy on a piece of paper now that I've
got little to no polish on my brush just
start lightly swiping it towards the
base of the nail both directions
horizontal and
whatever you want to learn if your brush
was accidentally too wet just take a
toothpick and pick away at some of the
paint orange comes next in the rainbow
repeat the same technique of barely
painting your nail I like to kind of
overlap the colors a little bit so it
looks like a dry brush gradient the only
time you'll ever see me using yellow on
my nails is in a rainbow why is this
called posh there's nothing posh about
this green Revlon especially without
dangly bastard who did you do do I'm
painting like a two-year-old I hate when
this happens
stupid tap I forgive the detective cap
because this blue is so pretty
this is one of those times when a red
toned blurple looks nothing on camera
like a does in real life
ya feel the peel oh it feels so good I
have a confession to make you know what
this is I've been in the closet for a
while and I feel like I should probably
share with you that I Christine up
simply illogical I'm a hollow sexual I
can't help it I'm addicted yeah it's a
rainbow on rainbow oh my god that makes
it a double rainbow this is my favorite
hallo taco then she put the link in the
video description box below for you
funny hello I want to paint making your
new good bean toes touching collar add a
quick dried top coat because this is key
to performing the next step correctly
let it dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes
I would probably safely say an hour -
because if you don't then you could risk
picking it up with the toothpick you'll
see next part 1 of how to pretend to
paint complete
I wish letters I get in the mail
actually came rainbow like this even
though this rainbow may appear
distressed it's having a gay old time
take a fancy overpriced paintbrush and
dip it in black acrylic paint I'm just
kidding I'm using a brush from an
inexpensive brush pack I got online now
you're going to outline your nail with
the black acrylic paint one of the
reasons why nail artists tend to use
acrylic paint to paint details instead
of using actual nail polish it goes on a
lot smoother and you can layer it and it
won't get lumpy if things aren't going
that well in your line isn't that
straight don't worry about it cuz I'm
going to show you the toothpick trick
next is to do - just making my line
straighter
ol√° I can't paint and I made a mess
wait a couple seconds to let the acrylic
paint dry just a bit and then take a
toothpick and scratch it right off
random shape time I'm using a different
longer striping brush here because
striping brushes helped me to paint
longer straight lines but it still
doesn't mean you're gonna do it
perfectly so just take that toothpick
and scratch the black off where you need
to I am painting random lines and shapes
that make no sense
oops I made that line too thick let's
add a second line to balance things out
if it weren't for the topcoat that I
dotted before I wouldn't be able to
scratch the acrylic paint off with the
toothpick I added another triangle okay
should probably stop now before I cover
up all the rainbow add a glossy top coat
to protect your masterpiece now I find
that no matter what talk coat you use it
tends to sink in kind of weird to the
acrylic paint you can see it's a bit
textured so I always add to talked codes
when I painted with acrylic paint now my
nails will be shiny forever and there
you go with just two simple techniques
you've learned how to fool everyone into
thinking you're an amazing painter
some of you have been asking for a nail
polish collection video and I will do it
one of these days how about I'll do it
when I hit a thousand polishes in 10
time at 870 now this entire shelf is
hollow this is my boring show be right
back
gotta go back some hollows kidding
that's hollow mom loves matchy
don't fight it just take it thanks so
much for watching guys and while I have
you and tranced buy my cute kitten face
could you please subscribe to my channel
so I can raise money to buy manche 1/4
of an eighth of a half of a chicken
treat see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
