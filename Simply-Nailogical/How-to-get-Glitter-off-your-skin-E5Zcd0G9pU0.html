these bloody glitter nails and fingers
by watching my other video what do you
mean you haven't yet well you better
click on my other video because I want
double views wow the honesty here today
is amazing
so simply peels basically my secret
weapon to removing all things that are
difficult to remove such as gradients
but also bloody glitter that you cut all
over your fingers because it's
technically a liquid latex I'm pretty
sure that puts me in the same category
as like special effects makeup artist
watch out glam and gore and made you
look I'm coming for you cuz I got that
peel porn and you know it yeah
I got exactly what you need
death dead okay I'll stop making nail
polish related popular song remixes I
promise oh yeah so what's going on here
yeah that's right we're peeling off the
simply peel stuff that I put under this
glitter clusterfuck of Awesomeness
and it's really quite that simple yet
just peeling it off yeah it's so easy I
just love it it's relaxing it's a great
form of therapy if you had a stressful
day I mean sometimes I just put simply
heal randomly on different parts of my
body and don't put anything over it and
I just feel it off because it feels good
don't mind these acrylic paint straggly
bastards
apparently acrylic paint can be removed
with soap and water so I'm not going to
listen to that and I just licked the end
of the q-tip with my mouth and took it
off with my saliva as I was lazy and the
sink is so far Hey look I guess you
could wear this less extreme version of
bloody glitter nails if you wanted to
like a normal person and not paying your
hand but while we're here why not peel
off our nails to some dumbass sounds so
weird someone who doesn't know anything
about nail polish okay
maybe like what you're gonna peel off
your nails that's disgusting it sounds
painful and then we're like no stupid
it's a peel off base coat it makes
removal super easy and I put the link in
the video description box to my favorite
peel off base coat for you and while
we're on the topic of stupid people
yes my nails are yellow and no nothing
is wrong with them they are completely
healthy they are just dramatically
stained because if you haven't noticed I
do my nails a lot even though I already
made a video explaining why yellow nails
don't matter and what it actually means
and why it's not a bad thing people
still to this day comment a whole bunch
of crap like you should give your nails
a break they're so disgusting don't
touch my food well you don't worry
little girl okay because I'm not going
to be serving you shipped ah that's
better I'm all clean feeling refreshed
and back to being yellow again now what
should I do with all the stuff I just
peeled off my body well I'm gonna put it
in a ziplock baggie and then put it
under my pillow of course did I mention
that I was a psychopath
so yeah it's perfectly normal I've just
saved all of my manicures that I've done
using my favorite fuel off base coat and
I shut them all in the bag because I
mean like how much fun is this bag it's
like a bag of memories of joy every time
I'm feeling sad I just open this bag and
take a big ol walk down memory lane and
think of all those good times ahead
changing my nails alright that's enough
for today don't forget to subscribe to
my channel because you too are also a
freak don't lie I know thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
