how to make not just any nail video
tutorial but amazing nail video
tutorials whoa it's like a paradox of
video tutorials first things first I use
an actual camera which means that I
don't film with my iPhone or Android
phone or any other kind of phone sorry
Zack and therefore I do not use an app
my camera may look profession on an
actual photographer and I rely on Google
to teach me all the things you don't
need to use a big fancy looking camera
like this one here to learn anything
from this video even a point-and-shoot
camera would apply to what I'm going to
show you today
but if you are planning on shooting and
editing videos with your cell phone then
you should probably just stop watching
right now unless you want to see my cat
this is a black piece of foamboard I
picked up at Michael's you can get it in
a few different colors like white and
lots of people use hollow or sparkly
backgrounds which can create a nice
blurring background glitter effect I
tend to just use these sparkly
backgrounds for nail photo shoot
backdrops you can find these sparkly
backgrounds at Michael's or most other
craft stores they cost between 50 cents
to a few dollars per sheet personally I
like to use the black foam background
because it's not a problem if you make a
mess on it every now and then I'll have
some nail art casualties in the form of
polish all over my black foam board so
when that happens I just move it around
or flip it over
well that sides already ruined so never
mind that but also because we don't want
people to get too distracted by the
sparkly awesomeness and instead have the
nail art itself pop in your face it's up
to you what background you film on but
any of these options are probably better
than a paper towel I can't use natural
daylight because as you can see I'm
literally in a cave or a back room of a
condo that doesn't have any windows and
I live in Canada which means that
there's no Sun ever I only use two light
sources and basically their bulbs that I
picked up from my local photography
store these two bulbs are 50 200 K which
means 5200 degrees Kelvin which is a
measurement of temperature color
so while 8000 K is really blue in color
3000 K is warm and yellow 5,200 K is
somewhere in the middle and is said to
be the closest to simulating daylight I
screwed these two light bulbs into two
very standard desktop lamps that I
picked up from Home Depot I actually
don't use a lightbox I tried it once and
I wasn't liking how it diffused the
light so I stopped using it and my cat
started using it before I get into my
camera let's start with the tripod this
one's mine and it's more heavy-duty than
your average tabletop tripod and
therefore more expensive but you'll see
why I think it's worth it soon with this
tripod it's very easy to adjust the
height change the camera angle and
adjust the camera rotation look at all
the measurement thingies this one also
extends into a full-size floor tripod so
here's an example of a crappier but much
cheaper tabletop tripod it tips over way
too easily with a full-sized heavy
camera
it's like mine after a couple months of
use the joint started to give out and
crack and now some of the pivot tourney
thingies are permanently loose and I
can't tighten them at all anymore
also this tripod can only be adjusted so
high and for my camera setup this means
being way too close to the nail for my
lens to be able to focus now for my
camera it's a Nikon d50 300 and there's
a lot of buttons if you're not using a
DSLR then this probably won't look
familiar but just so you can see there's
a whole bunch of options in the menu
never mind the actual buttons on the
camera boo shutter speed aperture ISO
and a bunch of other stuff at least for
my camera I know I need to make sure
that the manual movie settings are on
this allows me to change a bunch of
things like light exposure and aperture
in the middle of filming another thing
is to check out what your frame size or
frame rate is so I always choose the
highest which is 60 P which basically
means 60 frames per second which means
it's going to look the smoothest there's
movie quality I just leave it as normal
and a bunch of other things you can
choose with my camera see how it's way
too dark I just change the ISO to a
higher number you can also change your
shutter speed or aperture while you're
in this screen view but I won't go there
for now
now four lenses see how far back my
nails are from the actual camera yet how
close they show up on the screen that's
because I'm using an 85 millimeter lens
this lens is more powerful than the
standard macro lens that's sold with
this camera which is a 40 millimeter
lens I'm going to show you the
difference between an 85 and a 40
millimeter lens so here's my 40
millimeter lens I've snapped it in and
even though my hands are at the same
distance of the camera look how far back
they are on the screen I prefer the
nails be much more zoomed in
but with these kinds of macro lenses
they don't have a zoom feature they only
have a focus feature so no matter how
much I turn the lens thingy around it
just goes in and out of focus but it's
not actually a zoom function if you want
to zoom lens then you need to buy a lens
designed to zoom but then you lose some
of the macro capabilities of macro
lenses
to make my nails close up to the screen
I'd have to raise my nails this high or
get a different tripod that allows the
camera to go closer to the ground
remember that crappier tripod that
breaks really easily it actually adjusts
to a good height with the smaller 40
millimeter lens basically you have two
main options if you have a DSLR use a
smaller cheaper lens with a crappier
tripod or a much better but way more
expensive lens with a better tripod but
if you spent all your money on nail
polish yeah well then you might have to
go with the cheaper lens
I edit my videos in iMovie which is a
very straightforward program that comes
with any Apple computer even if you have
a PC there's many iMovie equivalent
programs designed for windows computers
in iMovie on the left hand pane I've
created a video library and called it da
to cure hit import media you'll see the
little pie chart loading and then select
the video files that you want to import
hit import selected just ignore this
flakey video that I was making
previously you're going to hit file new
movie I never use a theme there's
different themes you can use and then
name your movie whatever you want scroll
through your film and pick whatever
sections you want to include in your
video so I'm just going to add some
brush porn here to speed it up or slow
it down click on the little turtle thing
and you'll see options of making it fast
slow or custom which I like to use or
you can pick your own percentage there's
also a whole bunch of other functions
like kneading the sound which I like to
do in my videos because I put music on
that changing the panning or the
cropping of the video and a whole lot of
other good stuff
most things people want to know is how
to add a watermark
so it's really quite simple in iMovie
you just go to titles and then I usually
pick the one that says lower third as it
means it's going to appear at the bottom
of the movie you lay it over your film
then you hit the text button to edit the
text and type in whatever you want
you can add any clips you want from your
film role and you can trim them in the
timeline which is that bottom interface
thing to add music you just hit iTunes
if you have iTunes that is I don't know
what it would say if you don't all the
songs you have in iTunes will be there
and you can use the little search thing
at the top if you're looking for a
specific one but I'll just take a random
one and then you pick the section of the
music track that you want to add to your
video and you can crop it in the
timeline - to export your video this is
important you go to file share file and
then it's going to give you a preview of
what your video is going to be and it's
going to say the size I always pick 720p
because doing it this size means that
once it's a 15 second clip it will never
exceed the 25 megabyte attachment
required to send myself the video by
email you can use the higher resolution
one if you're going to upload to YouTube
though you can change the name if you
want pick where to save it and hit save
it'll make your movie and then it will
tell you when the file export is
complete so then you can find your video
wherever you saved it and it saves as an
mp4 file which is compatible on all
social media platforms and there it is
to share your video on YouTube you
literally just hit upload and yeah I'm
going to stop there but to upload it to
Instagram which is what most people want
to know you literally just send it to
yourself if you're using Gmail then
Gmail allows up to 25 megabyte
attachments all of my 15-second videos
which is the time cap for Instagram
video posts are under 25 Meg's so I can
easily send them through Gmail then hop
on your iPhone or iPad or Android or
whatever phone you're using to upload
stuff to Instagram go to your email
download the video
and post-it
it's really that simple
now that you have amazing nail videos
made how do you get more followers with
them I only know enough about Instagram
on this Facebook hates me
but here's my number one tip use feature
hashtags feature accounts are accounts
that feature others videos here's some
great ones that I know of when you read
their bio you'll notice that most of
them tell you what's hashtag to use like
this account that has a massive
following and there's so many others
like it hey that's me don't get
discouraged if they don't repost your
video right away sometimes they'll
repost videos of mine from months ago so
it's really kind of random and lastly
there's my new feature account where I
share nail videos but also nail humor
posts because we didn't really need just
another nail video feature account did
we
whew that was the longest however many
minutes of your life just for that
here's my top six tips for making
amazing nail video tutorials do it right
get a real camera or at least a
point-and-shoot and don't use your phone
don't be shaky get a tripod good
lighting I can't stress this enough
invest in some good bulbs they're really
not that expensive backgrounds just
think about the possibilities editing do
it right with the computer program and
forget about apps if you really must use
an app I've heard that people use these
but don't hold me to it share share
share your amazing hard work and
dedication because after all you just
wasted hours of your life and one last
thing it's no surprise that I have no
advice to give on how to do voiceovers
because clearly I struggled with that
with this video if you like this video
or at least just like my cat being in it
