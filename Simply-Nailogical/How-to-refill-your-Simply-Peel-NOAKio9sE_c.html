simply illogical slab get your pen and
notepad out because you will be taking
some very important notes in today's
class please give a warm welcome to my
teaching assistant mentee the cat she's
very good at complex equations and
chemical compositions give another warm
welcome to my second teaching assistant
xyler when she's eldest and only brother
Schuyler actually knows what pi means
now let's begin today's lesson in
today's class you're going to learn four
different ways to refill your simply
peel liquid latex bottle when you're
running low you think you don't need a
how-to video while you do because
refilling a semi liquid substance from
one bottle to another is like rocket
science what is simply peel you ask
claps it's that amazing magical staff I
used to peel off the crapper on my nail
and all my other tutorials back in the
Dark Ages when you were a fetus nail
artists use paint brushes and acetone to
clean up those nasty messes around the
nail but ever since the liquid latex
revolution nail artists have been
rejoicing everywhere because now they
can clean their cuticle area and keep
one of these such magical liquid latex
products is simply peel
a creamy substance and a polish like
bottle equipped with a polish like brush
it even tells you when it's dry and
ready to go by sparkling in the Sun like
a vampire for more information on
peel-off cleanup products you can watch
this video which will show you in more
detail what the liquid latex height is
all about find out which products get an
A+ and which products get a big fat fail
back to the point of today's
instructional video when you're running
low on your simply keel bottle the
economically friendly answer that
ensures optimal effectiveness and
quality control is to pick up a large
bulk sized refill bottle if simply peel
at the link below in the video
description box this large bottle holds
four times the product of the applicator
bottle but is almost half the price for
the 2 ounce value because you're buying
in bulk
moving on to important stuffs of today's
lesson how do we refill this bottle
method number one invent an elaborate
siphon contraption gather a bunch of
straws
preferably multicolored ones for best
results shove the ends of the straws
into each other to make a bunch of straw
extension if your nails are too long and
you fail at this step move to step 3 get
your significant other who doesn't have
any nails to build your elaborate straw
siphon contraption for you
rotate and twist your contraption as
desired to make an overly complicated
shape the more complicated the shape the
better it will work
things may get messy in the next step as
to put on some scientist gloves take off
the bottle cap on your applicator bottle
don't let the brush fall off the table
uncap the refill bottle place the
receptive end of your siphon contraption
firmly over the end of the refill bottle
spout siphon the liquid latex from the
other end of your invention using a
suction motion provided by your mouth
try your best not to drink or swallow
the latex remember that the bottle does
indicate it is not intended for internal
consumption once you fully fill the
siphon contraption with liquid latex
transfer the receptive end of the straw
from the refill bottle to the applicator
bottle
now blow using your mouth to release the
mixture please note you might need to
blow very hard to initiate transfer
try your best not to let your assistants
tamper with your materials you may never
get them back at this point I'm
wondering if I accidentally filled my
siphon contraption with blue based on
the behaviors exhibited by my past
method number two drop the liquid latex
into the bottle from a very high point
to avoid ingesting the mixture elevate
yourself approximately six feet from the
drop-off point below leave the simply
peel applicator bottle open and ready to
receive the latex air delivery simply
drop the simply peel in you may want to
shake it up high to speed up the person
please note this instructional video
will not be held liable for any messes
you may make in your house method number
three use telekinesis to transport the
mixture from one bottle to the other hey
I mean if this guy did it with this
chair over a hundred years ago then
surely we can do it no problem
concentrate really hard and use your
mind power to raise the refill bottle up
and release the latex mixture into the
applicator bottle please note this
instructional video is not responsible
for your inability to perform
supernatural powers method number four
for the liquid latex directly in from
the refill bottle into the applicator
bottle
when the applicator bottle is now full
tap both bottles and be sure to shake
them up because that's a thing that
scientists do liquid latex
troubleshooting
I am dried up does not compute if you've
got lots of dried up liquid latex gunk
on your applicator brush have no fear
the toothpick trick is here simply take
a toothpick and start to prod and poke
at that piece of dried-up disgusting
latex is the latex stuck in a big nasty
wad around the top part inside the cap
don't worry about it just poke at it
with a toothpick and it'll come out you
can also kinda clean your brush this way
just by poking at the latex as luck may
have it these are the pig brain for my
next experiment
genius I know right it took a lot of
science to figure all this out now that
you've seen four different scientific
methods on how to refill your simply
peel go forth and choose a method that
works best for you
if this video seemed useless to you
remember that you guys asked for it in
the comment section of my last video if
you're wondering where you can get
simply peel I put the links to the only
places you can find it out online below
in the video description box this video
and its directors producers actors or
other affiliates will not be held liable
for any nonsense material taught in the
so called lesson simply peel should not
be orally ingested in doing so may cause
kidney disease heart failure stomach
ulcers bowel disorders cancer and in
some cases death approximately 80% of
Koch in this video should not be
understood as truth no cats were harmed
in the making of this video thanks so

useless content I'll release next class
