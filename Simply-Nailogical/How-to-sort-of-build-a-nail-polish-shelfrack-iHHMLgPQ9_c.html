nail polish elves no I mean my boyfriend
Ben built them for free but same thang
same thing so I've seen other YouTube
videos show you how to build a nail
polish shelf with foam boards and a glue
gun
no don't do that treat your nail polish
right and build it the shelf it deserves
you may have seen my double shelf nail
polish collection behind me in my
previous video but I outgrew that space
and approximately two months
so we built two more shells and now
there's a total for covering my entire
wall here is my boyfriend Benjamin and I
going on a nail polish shelf building
adventure this video may not actually be
helpful in teaching you how to build
your own shelf wood lots of wood lots of
different sizes of wood it was white but
we made it black with flat black spray
paint apply wood back board thing a
large rectangle of black fabric to
upholster the rectangle thing with spray
on adhesive to stick the fabric to the
back board scissors a pencil a ruler
it's clear but I swear it's there a
measuring tape thing don't do that
a hammer box of finishing nails hey look
it's my nails in my nails the thing that
checks if things are level one of these
things that detects aliens in the walls
there's one studs mean wood apparently I
don't know pink rubber gloves I'm just
kidding you don't need these that box of
easy anchors and screws it was easy
until it was hard a power drill thing a
person who can actually build things hi
hey that's not Vinci you gotta sacrifice
someone's nails and as long as they're
not yours so where are we going to that
near the Gulf Stone
thought you said we were going to the
movies no I said we were going golfing I
thought you said we were going to
Petsmart to buy savory salmon dinners
for men G no I said men she was coming
with us to build nail polish ups so
where are we going today to build and
nail polish shells do you even know
where you're going no where's Home Depot
you ready for this
the Depot's live here does she know that
the debug live here let's go find some
wood oh my god there's so many colors
guys look glitter
I'm gonna put it on my nails why does
this say glitter are these people stupid
wait what's that for to paint the show
live black nail polish lasagna okay
hollow glitter
that's not hollow litter jelly Crowley
something there Elliot you failed at
least proofing you just found new deli
let's go by there's so many carpets here
let's go she just needed to buy four for
the bag what's not black though I want
the black wood my own to some wasps
wedding dress
those are way too tall out how many wood
ingredients do we need you need enough
material for two shelves
they're called ingredients sure ply
don't bother me mmm-hmm and yeah sounds
like it's cute Judd he's into the MDF
already twelve feet long and you need
pieces that are 22 and 3/4 of an inch
long so we needed enough for 20 of those
seconds all right so I got three 12 foot
long and one 8 foot long that should be
more than enough
there's too much math in that
looks like a spacestation
there's the shuttle this guy thinks he's
the astronaut this machine is angry I
like cutting things I should put that on
now what are we gonna do build a nail
polish oh yeah you let me surprise you
let the screw the other guy look my god
I did I'm really intelligent I'll have
you know this we're going to Dairy Queen
our fabric Bo fabric land a berkland
multiple and fabric it's a baby that
won't shut up I want it to go feeling
you get when we have a nail fit I don't
want to take these off anymore
we could use wood glue but I'm lazy so
we're just going to start nailing things
together simply nail Michelle we're
gonna simply nailed it that's right so
after the top and bottom every fourteen
point eight centimeters if you want to
put eight shelves like we've done on
your other ones doesn't look like it
holds a nail polish but I have
faith what is going on with your
cuticles this is not okay
the better you do a job of measuring at
the beginning the less likely you are to
make mistakes later I can't even hold
this though cuz my nails will get in the
way nailing things with my nails I'm so
scared okay
I'll let you finish now why isn't it in
the middle it's close enough beautiful
no no this happened last time see how
that shelves kind of came a little too
far you could kind of just try to bend
them in a little and round the corners
this isn't what like a real person who
knows what they're would do
are you saying you don't know what
you're doing so you are recording no ass
founders need cake this is where some
stamping polish I'm gonna die is
exhausting
my finger was hurting looks like we
should have worn simply peel and you're
painting
Chris wake up we have to finish building
that nail show Chris let's go wake up
your mom what are you joking it come on
let's go
get some clothes on and let's go pajamas
oh my god it's mom run really long but
they tell me it's easy you have seven
lives she's stuck in my hair the best
part about being a nail artist is that
no one cares what you look like we can't
all be fabulous let's all eat the grass
together these your kids no I just found
the one street I'm so good at this
iris hurt so much we never learned this
is the extent of my knowledge of sewing
hi
what happened Spray boy spray beautiful
I made it myself
look at this pattern dad I'm so fancy
what's behind this door
really do some therapy
stay out somewhere important
what are we doing now put the back shelf
home from work now I gotta get to work
ready just kidding I'm not doing this it
has no nail polish so it's at make sure
not to miss the actual board money nail
or else this will happen so long as the
board is flat and it's okay to lie your
nail polish is on hello good stuff
so remember how been reminded us to
measure things every fourteen point
eight centimetres if you want to put
eight shells like we've done on your
other ones so if we did a good job
measuring the better you do a job of
measuring at the beginning less likely
you are to make the six like we've done
on your other ones better you do a job
of measuring like you've done on your
other ones less likely you are to make
mistakes less likely you are to make
mistakes so that doesn't make any sense
does it
he accidentally installed one two little
shelves that made the shelf space gap
thing too wide meaning that it didn't
match my already existing nail polish
shelves and said he was so mad that he
wanted to rebuild the shells all over
again and I was like oh it's fine I mean
like whatever no one will notice that
they don't line up do it yeah rebuild
the shelves yeah do it do it so a week
later I had two matching shelves there's
actually time to install them
easy anchor it's as easy as getting
someone else to do for you oh my god mom
look there's so much space for hollows
and lonely over there little fourth
wheel shelf you want to go with your
brothers and sisters catch you okay
we'll fix that space between you and I
spent approximately eight hours
