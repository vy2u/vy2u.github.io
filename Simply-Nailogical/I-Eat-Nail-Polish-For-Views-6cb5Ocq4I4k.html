voice nice and crystal clear I finally
upgraded my audio equipment do you like
the sound of my annoying voice better
now well hallo everyone it's me
christine again and today we're gonna
eat some nail polish because internet i
don't know i don't know why actually i'm
doing this because you guys asked me to
you ask me you ex mate to eight to the
nail polish so i got it i'm gonna put
you in my mouth if you're new here I
know what you're thinking oh it's just
one of those stupid edible videos again
subscribe if you hate edible videos so
this shit is called kid licks this is
for children there's no instructions so
these are nail polish and apparently
they're edible
so edible in fact that you can bake a
cake with it in fact we did that on my
other channel simply not logical you can
go watch us try and fail to make food
with nail polish it's not click made if
it's true right off the bat the
consistency does not look like nail
polish in fact it looks like baby food
what's this baby food you should be
called baby licks now that's weird
all right let's get to swatching i'm
gonna put these on my nails just for you
oh my god all that's weakness these
expire how old are these truth be told I
got them like a year ago
oops most things I eat don't expire like
cereal or oatmeal packs or mr. noodle
cups I don't know what that black thing
is but it can't be good anyways let's
watch oh oh shit it's dripping the brush
is bent on this one defective I don't
think it's a one coat wonder I'll say
that much this smells so bad like it
smells like dead babies it's not an
appropriate
okay so first impressions I would say I
really like the coverage it applies very
evenly on the nail
maybe we need two coats okay let's we
got to give it a fair review I even have
a youtube channel someone remind me why
I even do YouTube again this is fucking
nasty all right beautiful
who wore it better me or glitter forever
and now we've tasted
you want to do this fuck me oh my god oh
my god oh my god oh my god so I'm pretty
sure that's expired but it's not nail
polish if it expires in a couple months
like that's some bullshit right there
this was so disgusting that I'd probably
rather eat actual nail polish
preferably hollow all right let's do the
green next which is probably a bunch of
kale or other pretentious green
vegetables I'm not even gonna smell this
one we're just gonna paint it on we're
just gonna slap it right on why are all
the brushes DUP this one literally
smells like fake a swamp baby threw up
and then took the shit and in it's
throw-up hahahaha nice visual I know
you're wondering like why am I still
putting this on my nails if it's clearly
expired nasty but I do it for you you
can see the little tiny pieces of kale
or green or bacteria I don't know I have
a message for everyone who asked me to
do this is that who's disturbing me Oh
what do you know it's Rob from thread
banger he says how tall are you what I
don't know what kind of drugs the two of
them do together but I would like some
at this point I'm really happy Ben
hasn't brought me Starbucks because I'd
probably throw it up you know what I'm
gonna do Ben's out buying all the baking
supplies right now to make a cake with
this shit and I'm not going to tell him
that it's obviously expired and
disgusting I'm gonna make him taste it
first let's see if he still likes carrot
cake after this I don't care how much
someone is willing to pay me I am NOT
putting this in my mouth there's enough
other stupid channels that you can go
watch but weird things
her mouth I am NOT one of them all right
I saved the best color for last this one
is like jam actually that one is the
best coverage so I think we found our
winner for the swatch part of this video
if you're looking for a nail polish that
can do it all one coat red organic and
edible buy this baby food this one looks
nice I like this one a lot but you know
what it needs a hollow taco see this is
why I've been calling a topcoat a taco
all this time because a taco is edible
they're beautiful edible for the hollow
sexual I'm just kidding don't eat actual
nail polish your dummy alright so I hope
you enjoyed my review I read these 10
out of 10 screaming children and there
you have it another video you've watched
that is not helpful to you in your daily
life at all don't forget to watch the
baking a cake with nail polish video on
my second channel hurry up
someone else might beat you to it hahaha
please subscribe to my channel because I
care about you that was weep that was so
weak leave me a comment down below
saying which of these three flavors you
would take a little taste though if you
were locked in a room forced to watch
edible videos on YouTube for 24 hours
see there that or have a lick the choice
is yours and thanks so much for watching
this video I'll see y'all later
