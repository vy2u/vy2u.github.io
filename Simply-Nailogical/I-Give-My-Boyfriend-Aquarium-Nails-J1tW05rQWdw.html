to be a nail tech it says for
professional use of it what kind of ink
thing well hallo everyone it's me
Christine again and you say hello hello
there hello there
hallo it's Hollow hello you're going to
hell so you guys remember when I did my
snow globe nails well Ben really liked
them and so I said you know what I would
like to do but haven't had the chance
because I didn't want to destroy my own
natural nails aquarium nails which is
kind of like snow globe nails in that
they have like liquid floating in the
middle of the nail except that with
aquarium nails you need to extend the
nail with a long clear thing where a
snow globe nails there is just like a
bubble on top so all the videos I've
watched on aquarium nails use someone
with little to no existing nail and then
they build a nail extension with clear
gel or acrylic so that the whole nail is
see-through I already have long nails
that aren't see-through yeah and I also
don't really want to bound with gel in
acrylics on my own natural nails but you
know whose nails I wouldn't mind taking
that risk what's the risk oh nothing to
worry about it I'm sure it'll come off
alright first we're gonna need to take
care of those cuticles what's wrong I
can't be seen with someone with cuticles
like this I do things with my hands oh
this is so satisfying
oh then doesn't it feel good it feels
better when you're not talking
I'm so glad you returned to the simply
spa man you gotta bathe my feet and
champagne - yeah whatever you want as
long as we're gonna pay for it what are
you actually doing then how are you
gonna go get me tea like this really
nasty motherfucker right there
if we're gonna need to perform surgery
looks like you'll be dead half the job
normally I would say never cut your
cuticles except Ben cuz it's not taking
care of them so much that there's like a
giant pieces of skin that won't scratch
off any more you probably have more nail
polish in this room than most nail
salons do right yeah good point see I
could run my salon out of my home based
business could that be legal sure you'll
do the taxes it'll be fine that's the
fucking nail tech below what do I do
it's like the dentist gotta put in my
portfolio oh absolutely
[Laughter]
no they look so much cleaner your skin's
nice and push back that's I don't charge
for those okay next step is I gotta
watch a tutorial
you didn't do this before aquarium now
what do we got eight months ago 14
million views newest aquarium now new
technique the best is coming soon
hey everyone I am here to make another
aquarium nail I'm going to be using a
European square to cut off a number a
straight flush with the edge of the
smile line what's the smile going to use
I feel I'm doing some platform this will
help to seal up this tank here seal that
tank that's gonna be our tank yeah yeah
fix up the sides here supposed to drill
and just be careful and lucky I don't
have that we have to make a plug with a
little hole in it
if you wonder why it gets flagged as
only friendly for teenagers gosh guys
syringe and just paint the back of the
tank I think I got it never done this
before
no I'm gonna test this out unlike a fake
hand or something for nope that's what
your hair oh these are the like shaping
guides or guards they only come in pack
of 100 cuz I guess
I'm not there yet I'll get your only
client it's like a bib it's like it's
wearing a wizard hat yeah though look
we're done look at this brush so
professional that's the first thing I
think what I see that much first one is
gonna wow oh my god oh oh my glob and
this is the moment I'll be coming out so
we're basically building you and now
like build-a-bear better now you have no
idea what you do excuse me do not insult
the staff here now we're gonna make that
shit full weight also gonna cure the
whole thing yeah okay homegirl all right
let's see oh it's still sticky that's
not what slows Evan the instructions say
cure for three minutes under laughs oh
yeah make that shit for three minutes
upgrade what makes this one better
really no it just seems to you like a
stronger wattage or something um I'll
ask a professional man she might be
quiet I'm gonna add a little bead down
the side that's wet so this will stick
to it
that's mushy I trust Denis John 65 you
have never had any fish they would have
died gotta connect the space in between
your own nail and this nail tip
face the tweet now we cut the corners so
there's stuck stuck real good
that she's never coming up it was hot
out it's just because it's on your skin
something started burning yes no what
it goes away I feel like okay find
second alright don't burn your patients
Katie the little more bills do you trust
me
no I mean why you're not just doing this
on yourself
kids please don't do this at home please
visit your trusted local nail technician
or else you might burn the boyfriend I'm
just kidding in our laughing matter
Stephanie you're really hurt should we
try and split this no how do I know that
it's fully sealed this it's the only one
way to find out what do you fill it
water I actually thought it would be
water when I did the snowglobe nails as
well but apparently when you do that it
doesn't have this like cool floating
oily effect so the trick is to use baby
oil this is what we use the oil of the
babies you know how they make this they
take babies and then they squeeze it
just like grapeseed oils from great that
looks like a real juicy Johnson's baby
look on the back it says we love babies
música homely baby say popcorn at will
you will mineral perform solo po and
film sofyan pretentious can this work
please detritus young le mama phone
conference at Johnson's to Joe Lou a
delicate that's right they're clinically
proven clinically proven to miss your
baby only we got some iridescent
glitters hallo ladies they actually
didn't have any fish what I got a bag of
fruit come look for the bananas I'm
gonna take the glitter shovel it in hmm
now we have some mermaid scales which
are like little iridescent flakies so
that's fun that's fun I'll give me at
least a couple seashells she sells
seashells down by the seashore
good job like a pineapple under the sea
duh of course
okay ready for what the baby oil extra
virgin baby but is it leaking anywhere
on this side somewhere all right
emergency surgery okay we're gonna take
care of you little buddy maybe some more
builders gels and all I got to do the
glassy gel taco over everything anyways
I hope you layers gonna polish around it
just like it's gonna fall everywhere
that's not no bad that's not a good idea
ban no mr. nail
now I'm gonna paint the back blue so
that it looks like a fish tank you know
it may not be and
in which fish can live because there's
no water to work don't lose okay now we
gotta steal quick quick so now what we
gonna do since it's perfect we're gonna
decorate the surface of the ocean oh
he's sliding let's do it and then you're
gonna bake the fish out 400 degrees
Fahrenheit at the center of the oven am
i boring you see nail art always looks
better on somebody else's nails you want
to buy all the Polish but I never go on
sale just look at the room Arab Jew
there's acetone on the floor the glitter
is all around you it pollutes the ocean
floor
under the sea turu turu under the sea -
- and so what do you think feel a little
oily here it's a bonus no extra charge
I'm particularly impressed with my
skills considering I have zero knowledge
of acrylic or builders gel the fact that
I was able to build this and it seems
like it's not leaking anymore I think
I'm pretty sure you're a qualified nail
tech now yeah aquarium she says there's
something fishy about that nail and I
can't can I put my paw in it like
nothing when two men Cheers oh how do I
get this off I'm not sure if I'm
qualified to take this off then wouldn't
that work then cringe Wow it's gotta get
you something - well
that's for your protecti aliens all
right ready to go for a dip I need
gloves for protection
nice she's in my will at water brother
looks much like that it's gonna take as
long to take off as it took to do it all
right everybody

oil still is thanks for coming to the
simply spot that'll be five hundred and
forty dollars American okay you know
