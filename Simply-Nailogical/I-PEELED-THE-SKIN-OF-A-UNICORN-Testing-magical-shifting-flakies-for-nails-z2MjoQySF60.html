nail channel that will actually be about
now well hello everyone it's me
Christine again and it's true I've been
kidnapped I'm being held hostage and I'm
being forced to make actual nail art
videos against my will so now that
that's out of the way who wants to play
with some flakies flaky flaky so many
teens ladies but first did you buy a cat
shirt or a cat hoodie I need to know
that you bought clothing with cartoon
images of my fluffy children on them
it's for a pets charity because I want
to send other cats to college too and PS
I brought back the holo shirt but colors
this all my new merch is available right
now I put the link down below the cats
are limited edition so make sure you
grab it before it's gone so this magical
flaky stuff is not glitter and it's not
hollow it's actually unicorn skin yes
that is the technical term for it then
cut unicorn skin please see these three
videos as reference okay it's more like
loose iridescent flakes or scales or the
skin pale ease of the Unicom I'll link
to all the different kinds of flakies
and other stuff I use in this video down
below so make sure to check out the
description box for all your ethically
harvested unicorn skin consumption needs
first things first let's prep our
plastic models for the experiment in one
nice coat of black polish paint on a
bunch of models and oh what's that on my
other hand it's a gorgeous royal blue
holographic polish with holographic
rectangles and iridescent glitter I mean
look at that shift to pink Wow
look very closely there's 50 shapes of
Hollow in there I'm going to show you
what I tried first which was wrong but
I'll show you anyway I applied a glossy
gel taco and then cured it thinking the
flakies could be buffed onto the nail
like the nail powders are so it capped
on the unicorn skin and then buff them
in and yeah unicorns no likey they
mostly just disintegrated good news for
you you don't need any gel shit all you
need to apply the flakies is a good old
nice thick coat of glass decaf
oh so stinking so glassy I tried
applying the flakies with the silicone
applicator thing application could have
been better
what about an eyeshadow applicator I
have hundreds of these after simply
faced logical showed me the way of
makeup uh yeah no oops what about a fan
brush I used to be a fan but now I'm an
air conditioner oh and then I
accidentally knocked over the entire
goddamn container of the rare unicorn
skin I'm probably going to be publicly
shamed on social media for this sure is
pretty though
now this is some snow I don't mind
shovel and get back to work we got nails
to do how rare I know right now that
we've nailed down the best possible
application let's look at the different
breeds of unicorn skin first up is
greenish bluish flaky from twinkle feet
well these are the ones I was just using
but now I'm going to use them properly
flake it till you make it
you know what I'm saying so you pretty
much just dust the unicorn skins onto
the nail well the glossy taco is still
wet beautiful now add another nice thick
coat of glassy taco to seal all the
unicorn skins into your body
Wow a good time transform and that my
friends is why unicorn skins are in such
high demand on the market today I mean
look at those magical shifts from green
to deals the purple to blue Wow now
let's try these play keys I got from
Dollar nailers these unicorn skins are a
much thicker cut they're less flexible
and they remind me pretty much exactly
of iridescent cellophane or gift wrap
paper from Michaels these are beautiful
but Pesky's help to pin down you know
what I mean and you got to really load
on the glass to tacko to tame this
unicorn
just stunning you could probably even
scratch yourself with the surface of
your nails all the next psyches are from
born pretty store which you can get off
Amazon and put some links below and
there's no way of identifying them or
what shade your colors type of skin they
are because there's no fucking label in
any case I got them in nine different
shades of unicorn they'll lift estimate
these ones are more similar to the
twinkle key ones they're thinner and
more flexible than the harder Philippine
ones but they're still kind of rigid and
a bit crinkly they're not that seamless
or flat even when you light them down on
the nail does that make any sense it's
more like crinkled up cellophane as
opposed to nice flat sheets of it next
flaky shade again I don't know what this
one is called but it looks green so
let's go with that pretty kind of icy
green with a splash of pink a glossy
taco horn should make a compilation of
just that and another one this one also
looks green I'm kind of getting bored of
green flaky right girl
in fact this almost looks the same as
the firstborn pretty one I used maybe I
success maybe it is I don't know oh look
more green yay this one is a bit more
limey green as opposed to a turquoise
green if you will it's amazing how when
you put a glossy taco over something it
really changes the color wow look at it
like enhance the saturation are those
yellow flakies holy shit nope they're
purple so what I learned in doing this
experiment is that when you take a look
at the flakies in the container that
come in because the container is usually
white or clear the apparent color of the
flakies is actually going to become the
opposite color once you put it on black
it's amazing
unicorn skin science blows my fucking
minds
Oh glossy taco for the wind farm are I
mean I know at this point you're
probably thinking
leave some unicorn skins for the rest of
us and yeah what about the unicorns
right
someone had to peel a poor unicorn skin
every season for a year in order for me
to make this video oh look it's yellow
green skins I bet it's going to turn out
pink yes thank you color wheel ooh I
like this one it's very pretty
whoo this one's giving me serious
mermaid buzz got like a flash of reddish
pink in there I mean no unicorns would
be offended that I called them mermaids
and another one pretty and another one
okay this is the lastly key oh wow this
one has a hint of the bright purple
unicorn skin species let's take a quick
look back at the first year we did
because they were very similar in color
I think the born pretty store ones have
way more color options but I personally
prefer the texture and appearance of the
twinkle tea ones just because they're
flatter less crinkly there's more of a
depth to them on the nail and you can
really see the different layers of
unicorn skins now that we've played with
so many unicorns let's have a little fun
shall we what if we make a unicorn skin
gradient this is super easy nail art to
do you literally have no excuse glass
attack oh that shit and bam you got
yourself a blended unicorn you could
also choose to apply the unicorn skin
smart sporadically for a less dense look
Alex pretty it looks like little bits of
gold is catching a car let's try the
same thing I'm just using the end of an
orange stick or you could use a
toothpick and do a gradient again it's a
picture unicorn skins are fantastic but
they're missing one thing so you know
what's next girl let's add a hollow taco
oh yeah here's a larger glitter hollow
taco and now I'm going to try a smaller
hollow glitter hollow taco oh that's so
pretty
galaxy unicorn vibe now what if we add a
matte taco fun fact adding a matte taco
over iridescent flaky gives them a whole
new look from the whole other dimension
because the matte taco reduces the shine
it really allows the edges of the flake
used to stand out what if we put them
over Hall here's a purple linear hollow
wow that looks pretty I mean it kind of
hides the hollow but you see a peek
through but what about over colors just
throwing the more crinkly greenish
likies over a nice
genta pinkish-purple what about over a
nice bright baby pink wow that one is
very iridescent looking Joey Graceffa
would love these
now what about over white now that is
really cool it looks like an opal what
about over royal blue holla this team is
fun it's pretty but I'm kind of
underwhelmed at this one what about over
aqua blueish green that's really nice
the reminds me of the iridescent pink
bubblegum one I don't know why I picked
the orange play keys to go over this
dark screen this either really works or
it really doesn't you tell me I'm trying
those same oranges corals like he's over
top of white and wow that is really
beautiful that's probably my favorite
over white combination how about a
gradient is kind of a sunset gradient
beautiful so pretty look at all the
possibilities friends holy shit I just
remembered I have actual nails let's
paint them my little baby nail is
growing in isn't it so cute I just added
some peel off base coat and now one coat
of my favorite black creme polish a nice
thick coat of glossy taco and I seem to
have some little bits of unicorn skins
tucked in my taco instead of using a fan
brush I'm going to use the point of an
orange stick you could also use a
toothpick to do a more precise
application because I think if you apply
with a fan brush you risk accidentally
layering like six or seven flickies in
the same spot and that doesn't really
look as good you want to have less flaky
but spread out more evenly look at the
melt right into the glossy taco it's
like when you were a child and you stuck
your tongue out for snowflakes
I found it worked best to gently tap
down all the flake use of my finger
first
and then take a fan brush and give it a
light dusting around the edges so any
flakies that are sticking out will spray
it off oh I realize I stepped this part
so we're just gonna fix that and now for
my favorite part a nice thick coat of
glossy tack
Oh baby it's so wet I mean what wow it's
like an ocean of unicorn skin such depth
such magic I wish this particular type
of flaky came in different color because
I like the texture and appearance of
this unicorn skin breed rather than the
other more crinkly one but you know what
I could do to make it even better add a
hollow taco Oh Christine you are so
predictable oh my god this is the best
of both worlds and have the magical
mystical shifting depths of the unicorn
skin and you have the beautiful spark of
the hollow brain box kind of amazing
because when your nails are under
indirectly you would see more of the
unicorn skin and then when they're under
direct light like your iPhone flash for
example you're going to see the pop of
Halle
it's beautiful it's perfect I love it it
doesn't even need art on top of it
because it's and of itself is art
alright everybody I hope you enjoyed
this actual email related video for a
change
leave a comment down below letting me
know if you did also let me know if
there's other things like this out there
that you want me to play with and
experiment with because question the
science Queen and don't forget you can
grab a cat hoodie or t-shirt or some
holo t-shirts there until now I put the
link down below in the video description
box I really appreciate all your support
and thanks so much for watching I'll see
