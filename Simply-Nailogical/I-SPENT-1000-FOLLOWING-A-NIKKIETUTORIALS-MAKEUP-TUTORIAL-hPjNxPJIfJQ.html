Mercier flawless fusion ultra long wear
found a yes I bought the exact same
foundation shade number and all because
I'm not interested in matching my skin
okay I want to look exactly like Nikki
well hello everyone meet Christine again
and today I am simply faced logical now
we're all familiar with the I tried
following beautiful person XY or z z--
makeup tutorial trend right and you've
probably been wondering why I haven't
done one yet because trying to be a
beautiful person is my part-time job
well surprised because I've been
scheming all this time to do it but it
required much planning in order to
execute it properly so here we are
months after the trend was a thing you
see the one thing I noticed in watching
all of these attempts to recreate a
beautiful person's makeup tutorial was
that the person doing the recreation
often didn't have every single product
that the beautiful person used I'm
definitely not gonna have a lot of the
products that she has but that's
something I do not have I don't really
have a lot of the products that Geoffrey
start using so I don't have that so I'm
just gonna go into my looks way
different than Christine and they wonder
why the recreation didn't turn out
perfectly
you see haha fools so two months ago I
research and hunted down the exact same
products used by none other than
beautiful person legend nikkietutorials
in this
tutorial sorry for the yelling it was in
capitals
so I ordered everything in the
description box and it took almost two
months for all of it to show up I'm a
Canadian dorsum and it also took $1,000
that's Canadian dollars but whatever and
that's even with using Nikki's discount
code wherever I could which was almost
everywhere but I got a bunch of new
makeup to play with so I'm excited I
really hope I end up liking all of this
all in the name of beauty because I have
her tutorial and now I have all of the
exact same products that she used on her
face Nikki move over because today I
will become you I will replace you my
face is ready and I've got some pimples
to join me today just in time for me to
film an up-close makeup tutorial yes I
picked at them shut up YouTube
Nikki tutorials hmm why are there often
- Nikki's and her thumbnails yeah I want
to go from that to that
hello guys hello guys welcome to winter
wonder weekday 4 it's the most
oh I thought it was fun to just sit down
and do a classic makeup tutorial video I
wanted to do Christine proud and just do
a hollow snack name okay I'm calm I'm
calm and professional let's get going
money for priming I wonder if I'm making
a true Instagram Legends is not gonna be
priming using the far Sally unicorn
essence got it oh I still go to my mouth
well don't put it in your mouth
apologists told me to punch test
everything and I told her I wouldn't be
beautiful person you little bitch okay
unicorn essence check what's next oil
control product and this is going right
on gotta go get into the zone of the tea
I love oh my god that is a giant this
bunch she did not list in her
description box it seems I am not the
only one frustrated that she doesn't
list this sponge a lot of people have
conspiracy theories about what she
doesn't list the sponge she uses Nicki
what is the sponge Oreo they they tell
us despite interior everything well
understand use this one because it's all
I have how does she do this without like
a goddamn headband how do any of the
beautiful people do this with their hair
down and nice and straightened and they
don't get makeup in it I don't
understand holy shit
wow this is like really yellow I thought
she was like a pink undertone lady like
me damn it now in full Nicky style we're
gonna cover our lips I'm honestly
surprised at how different of the skin
tone I guess Nicky is for me I thought
we were pretty similar but well I need
to blow my nose but I can't ruin my
foundation without them doing my
concealer oh oh that's some good
concealer it's like my whole eye
disappeared
you knew this step was coming huh no I
didn't the fit me loose powder in oh
five I'm gonna start oh I think she just
dips it in she dips it in prime my
eyelid using the select cover-up
concealer I'm putting in effort okay I'm
putting in work and I expect results I
don't look exactly like Nikki by the end
of this tutorial I'm gonna report her
channel for fraud okay this has resulted
in my eyes being extremely shaky let's
hope it'll all be made better with the
next day the first shade of going in
with is by the Zulu palette by drew vias
place and I'm applying this into the
crease using is the wave a 2 x 7 but
when did she do her eyebrows did I miss
it the first are gonna prime my eyelid
using this one where did you do it
well I'm gonna need that tutorial Nikki
so we're gonna have to find another
video of you doing your eyebrows first
we're gonna go into this the 4 up to
pick mint palette what she just skipped
it again what the fuck I am convinced
that someone else does her eyebrows for
her video or it didn't happen Nikki two
years ago three years ago six years ago
so we're gonna learn from her two year
old tutorial but I'm gonna use the
eyebrow products that she's listed in
more recent videos here's some swatches
it's a good match right
tapping it in and then filling in in
between the lines carve out the bottom
of my brow seems to be making my eye
concealer base extremely gay all right
well eyebrow intermission is over let's
go back to the tutorial the first shade
of going in with is by the Zulu palette
by Drew place and I'm applying this into
the crease using is the wave a tutus I
got it
alright I guess we're going in so
pigmented oh yeah
warning my eyes are under construction
hi to go in with the yellow okay yellow
doing so on a Mac two to one brush is
Mac your to one skin this is one of
those looks that looks atrocious till
the very last step basically you're
saying I should expect that I will do a
shitty job what brush are you using Nick
it's not this one because this is orange
now are you sure I can't just use my
trusty eyeshadow sponge applicators
please look like shit it's going into
the dubious placing magic palette and
I'm gonna go in with the magic palette
because we have lost all stickiness from
a pine the shadow over top of the base
I'm reapplying a bit of that concealer
to get the stickiness of the maximum
coverage
she's just rubbing the concealer in and
it turns dark where's me lugs here we go
concealer I'm still are
deep breaths Christine remember who you
are theologically we got this and I
personally love this shade even though
it's hard to blend but I love it how did
you blend it the concealer makes it
impossible to blend well I think this is
the most I shadow I've ever put on in my
life I am the Tiger Rag what's next now
I'm cutting the lit using a little bit
of that same concealer and more
concealer what is this me and my fingle
Ozzie talk to us and I'm doing a
spotlight smokey eye so it's just
focused on the center taking this shade
right here lending it in and also on the
inner portion here didn't he ever do 100
layers of makeup video oh yeah I guess
you wouldn't need to cuz she does that
every day look at all those creases
you're almost 30 years old it looked
like a very hot mess all this time but
now still kind of does glitter primer
and then finally sticking the hollowed
glitter overtop holla party holla potty
so those silvery hollow flakies you see
her using are listed in her description
box the only problem is the whole
website is written in a language that I
do not understand but after using Google
Translate and looking at the actual URL
of the website
BB's nail design it seems to me like
this stuff looks a lot like the hollow
flickies that we've used on our nails
and I don't think you're supposed to put
this stuff on your face I tried to buy
the exact same one that she linked
except it was sold out so in that event
we're gonna use what I think is maybe
the same shit I'm not gonna advertise
what it is because you probably
shouldn't be doing this I consider this
experimental beautiful person science
please do not attempt at home
dermatologist hates me so sad oh so
while the beautiful person lights around
me suck for showing the true rainbow
properties Paulo but don't worry I'll
give you sexy low Lipshutz litters
quickly highlighting my brow bone
highlighting the brow bone
smoking out that waterline using a black
coal this is my shoe II got it oh no not
the water line please oh and smoking it
out using a black shadow and - also
vegetable side it cuz I'm off the head
bitch I had to buy a third dubious place
palette just to get this black okay what
do I do next Nikki so it's been very
long and intense but you made it and
it's finally time for lashes these are
dull Beauty lashes in a vine
BAM dammit he left what eyelash glue are
you using she didn't list it so I had to
get my own I got this one House of
lashes because beautiful person mani MUA
told me that this one is good which eye
is this left oh man I can't do this in
film I'm sorry
it'll always be a mystery how I didn't
get these on properly I'm gonna bronze
next to neck and powder in medium dark
bronzing well isn't bronzing the same
thing as contouring like what the
difference
if you want to look like Nicky you gotta
be like Nicky you gotta act like a Nicky
a nice glowy blush I'm working it back
oh that's pretty
I like that I'm glad I got that time for
baking oh yeah I love me a good cocaine
beard
what's next Nicky guide me for my
Cologne that'll be taking this dull
beauty dull light highlighter and shine
no like a diamond unfortunately I was
very disappointed that this particular
highlighter was sold uh because now it
means that I will not look exactly like
Nicky however I did buy two of her own
khalad highlighters this better fucking
make me look like Nicky oh shit I think
I think I put too much is that even
possible
okay we're getting towards the end of
this triathlon shoe a long wear lip
cream liner right everyone bear with me
you might have to increase the screen
size on your monitor because we're gonna
try and trace my lips from this
foundation all over them
so I think the prerequisite for this
step might have been to get lip fillers
I'll put a bunch of shit on my face for
beauty but I will not inject things into
my face for beauty
I think I'm beautiful with or without
lips wouldn't you agree
for lipstick I'm gonna take this L'Oreal
balm ah urban Safari nude tennis I'm
pretty excited because this is my first
fancy designer bow man product it's not
a purse or a dress but it is a lipstick
and I am gonna put it on my face and I
will instantly be worth $10,000 oh my
god I'm twitching and then over top to
add some color this Finity beauty lip
gloss and to seal the deal some setting
spray he'll do I want to seal the deal
with you
did not breathe let me know in the
comments down below what you think of
this look I love wait a second why don't
I buy mascara if she never used mascara
I cannot wait to see you tomorrow for
day five so I hope that's asked you then
why no mandatory narcissistic montage
it's supposed to be mandatory oh well

nothing like myself but that was the
point right down in the comments below
