and welcome to another video you may
have recently seen my friend Sofia
attempt to recreate one of my many many
nail tutorials and you know what she
actually did a good job she even gave us
a bit of a show at the end there here
it's coming here we go hmmm how I
personally was pleased anyway so I
thought I would return the favor on the
21st of January
Sofia Nygaard published a video in her
questionable fashion decision series
where she wore an 8 foot long mohair
tube and then I thought to myself now
that is the sock I aspire to be
I'm the most sentimental sock you have
ever seen you see the suck is my
aesthetic when I wear sock like clothing
I feel like I can pull the hood over my
head and just escape from the world and
all the people in it and today thanks to
this majestic creation I'm going to
recreate Sofia's video and go full suck
so I searched for the sock I ordered the
sock and then I got the suck all the way
from Bulgaria where evidently the
greatest socks dresses live oh yes I
bought two socks because who buys just
one sock it's a pair of socks Wow look
at the Knitting guys it looks like a
bunch of little mini braids oh my
grandma is so jealous right now
now Sofia often brainstorms on how to
wear such questionable fashion items but
I know right away how this one is meant
to be worn falls off mode engaged
this is amazing I am a lonely
caterpillar one day I hope to become a
beautiful butterfly oh this is so warm
and cozy shit yep this is pretty much
the only way to wear it man my am my
what do you think what do you think okay
I'm gonna need you to be Tyler today oh
so you're gonna need to be sweet and
supportive and not make fun of me let's
go be hard
I have Woolies in my mouth you wanna
make out yes I'm gonna meet you at the
other end ready
hello there another video you're really
doing a good job of capturing what makes
the FIA's video so great haven't you
figured this out Sophia's approach to
YouTube is to give oh shit I'm wearing
for like five minutes
the blue one might look better because
it'll really bring out my eyes which
aren't blue why'd you get to it you
can't just buy one suck duh
you dance into it it's more effective
I'm in a sock case of emotion despite my
emotional comfort to being alone in this
room without other humans I'm going to
wander into the world for the day and
see what life has in store for this sock
first it was off to Starbucks because
this sucks gotta have its tea now
normally I would send my drinks late to
get it for me but today I wanted to see
what life would truly be like as lived
by yourself
he also has fur in it then it was time
to go where the people were in downtown
Ottawa in my homeland Canada there are
many different Canadian tourist
attractions here but today I became one
of them
is that thing a cheetah no why am i
irritating you all right let's go to the
mall just kidding I look fabulous I hope
they don't think I'm gonna steal things
with my giant
in the mall I wanted to see if I could
find other socks like me I did see some
blended knits that somewhat resembled me
and I spotted my cousins the hand towels
it's always good catching up but I was
desperate to find my immediate family of
socks so it was off to the lingerie
floor
baby what do you mean point zero sucks
all have a point I'll protect you here I
ended up in the men's socks section and
got some weird looks but I knew what to
do you're really blending in there look
like an old Russian woman I made friends
with some mannequins and met some sock
fans along the way I even took a stab at
modeling and let's be honest I was doing
a great job modeling more material than
the six of these other women combined I
was a sock on a mission not sure what
for but on a mission nonetheless
stop on a shopping trip
after my morning tea I had to find a
washroom and then it was time to get
some reactions now I expected that
people would be interested in my sock
because how could you not be intrigued
by this wooly figure slinking around a
shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon
in Sephora my sock even drew a bit of a
crowd because everyone wanted to know
how to look like such a beautiful sock
all right
we had enough fun today no many people
wanted a photo with me in my sock
obviously because they Anders never seen
such a fabulous sock and wanted to store
this moment in their memory forever no
problem
some even agreed they'd wear it
themselves would you wear that
that's a lie Lincoln Sofia may have worn
this sock as part of her ugly clothing
series but I can test that I like this
up a couple older women seem to have a
thing for my sock
and of course there would be other
people who gave me weird looks or just
ran away
but socks weren't always perceived as
weird as they have served a purpose
since long before any of us were born
which brings me to the next segment of
this video it's time for a short history
of the sock the modern word sock
originated in the 13th century and was a
term used to describe a late slipper
that represented a symbol of wealth
among the nobility but this type of
fabric worn around the foot has been in
and out of fashion since the beginning
of human civilization one of the
earliest known surviving pairs of socks
was excavated from the oxy righteous
region of Egypt these socks were divided
into because at that time humans had not
yet evolved and they only had two toes
on each foot in the Middle Ages socks
were believed to have analytic powers
providing spiritual protection from harm
and literal protection from the cold
these heathens wore socks for their
ostensible protective powers
specifically to ward off the bubonic
plague and also because they were a lot
more comfortable than simply walking
around barefoot in the 1930s people in
North Carolina were executed for wearing
socks and sandals at the same time
today in 2018 socks are a fashion
statement and a metonymy for the modern
aesthetic you can see socks being worn
by the likes of Rihanna Hugh Grant and
even Ryan Gosling in the modern world
the benefits of this breed of giant sock
extend well beyond the feet one key
element the sock gave me was the ability
to avoid social situations which I
really appreciate it was also incredibly
awkward trying to give people hugs
so in a way the sock displaced the
awkwardness from me on to the sock and
people just laughed instead of thinking
that I was insane it was kind of perfect
in a way not fully being able to shake
other people's hands or give them hugs
or other forms of social interaction
this is something Sofia also saw as an
advantage of the sock back into the room
I go so part of the appeal is the exit
strategy somewhat ironic that I felt
this soft protected me from social
situations but in turn it also made me
more social because I was just more
attractive to other people during my
outing as a Sox if he had tweeted that
she was filming something extra and so I
replied me too
it's important to note that the sock was
very long and probably better suited for
a person much taller than me I often
found myself having to pick up my sock
and hold it while walking around so that
it didn't drag on the ground and I had
to be especially careful with it on
escalators as the day went on the sock
grew looser and became more of a workout
to hold up because my weak ass founded
quite heavy to wear this for an entire
day it was heavy and I was sweaty the
advantage though to carrying all that
material around was that the sock was so
cozy I couldn't help but take a nap
almost everywhere I went
being a soft was pretty exhausting so we
decided to stop for some good old
Canadian fruits in it was warm and
tender just like me and it was tricky
trying to use my hands and having to
poke my fingers through the sock holes I
poked my fingers through so much I even
popped a bee lead well to Pili's
actually some mohair on my fries another
challenge was trying to eat without
getting a wooly hair in my mouth
dee-licious
a brisk walk outside was next I think
you just ruined a bunch of tourist
photos and boy was I sure glad I was a
sock because it sure gets cold fast out
here in Canada maple and as the day
turned into evening people were
gathering with their friends and family
to enjoy a night out on the town I on
the other hand walked home to enjoy my
night alone in the safe recluse of my
sock oh and Ben can come too I'm coming
in it's nice and steamy in here I feel
like the baby at the end of 2001 a Space
Odyssey relationshipgoals don't listen
to her
we should also acknowledge the aftermath
of the sock journey which includes
having hair everywhere the blue Woolies
stuck to my black cotton outfit and they
floated away in packs when they picked
them up lint rolling the hairs was very
satisfying though despite the infinite
number of wooly blue hairs I will find
on my body over the next few months I
would still wear this again ultimately I
think my affinity for the song is a
manifestation of my nihilistic worldview
and my desire to return to the womb and
be unborn thank you guys so much for
