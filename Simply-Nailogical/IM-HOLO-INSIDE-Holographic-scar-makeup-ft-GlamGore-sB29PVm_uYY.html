links hello everyone it's me Christine
again and beelzebub what my key from
Glenn League or you know who she is she
beautiful person look at her so you guys
know I've been going on my teach me how
to give you tour oh wait you slow down
no bill maybe I decided to change things
up a little bit I don't want to be
beautiful today and that's why we got my
key from glamming board we got my key
here's the thing about like you okay she
does a whole bunch of glam but a whole
lot of ugly and that's what makes her
channel very special I have no problem
so I'll ask Mikey to help me here today
because I would like to cut open my skin
and show my real true self because I'm
hollow inside
one day I will be a beautiful person but
not today
so I saw this post on Instagram by SFX
Grace and I thought it was amazing and
I'm like that's me okay I need my
insides to match my outside so instead
of teaching me how to beauty you're
gonna teach me how to ugly ugly I like
it yeah Norfolk this is so much more fun
already it let's do it excited
I brought some hollow you fell me the
hollow so we have a whole bunch of
hollow nail foils and it's basically
thin foil so I figure we could just kind
of tape it to our skin and then we would
create the oh you think you can we did
yes ever on taking glue and glue it tape
yet glue what so basically things we can
use to do this is latex that's a smelly
stuff it turns into rubber stuff so you
can use this for nail gradients we have
nine percent alcohol which we can use
for the paint to drink and to drink
perfect get wasted brushes blood
it's like painting a nail oh look at
that
it makes the foil turn different colors
makes the holo more hollow it's hollow
from the other side
yeah cool okay perfect we did it I've
seen you do this and you baby show major
nope wrong already
okay what do you do you like this
through the center but I didn't even
know cotton balls could be unrolled oh
now you okay yeah
cool and then we can use strands like
this can basically cover the tomato
inside yeah they're so long and doctor
like okay I'm gonna watch you first lay
some down here we go you know great no
I'm thumbs of us I can sorry I got
carried away with so much fun so into it
I didn't take some of your car and
you're gonna lay it down along Billy
tips then Jake more latex and fully
saturate common so put it on top yes you
can also start pulling here at the edges
where your gutters yeah and it'll kind
of give it more of a PC look instead of
a really straight oh yes oh wow you're
already look at you blasting through the
steps and they're not hurry up
I have like an urge to peel this off
though it feels good to feel it off oh
we need to let this dry anyway a plus
technique I'm guessing
so we need alcohol ja perfect
I'm thirsty 99% gets you drunk really
fast that's how I did in the university
and so we're going to take this
you're gonna dip it in your alcohol then
you're gonna pick brews colors with this
alcohol palette so you can kind of fill
in the skin color with that so it's like
a water color so you can build back yeah
so it's not pigmented right come on guys
looking good so good yeah it's a lot
it's a little excessive now we had blood
whose what is that your last victims I
see too reckless
it's like Jam just kind of like powder
around it a little bit it takes away the
shine of the latex which makes it look
oh yes yes so is this like baking powder
no it's it's legitimate makeup that's
what I meant
bake my face now yeah this is your more
hip than I thought oh thanks I've been
studying you hey ever so it's just to
kind of mattify it yeah so it's like a
matte taco but powder and you done
that's amazing oh my god high-five wait
did you do my face yes it'll go much
faster
here the ugly narcissistic montage
Halloween mom so I gotta ask you guys
what do you think why don't you guys
judge in the comments what looks better
my hand or what Mikey did on my face I
mean from here at all of the same to me
yours looks better it looks more
realistic mine is just too wide of a
slit like how would this happen you're
concerned about realism yet there's
hollow foil underneath is realistic to
me and my people what's wrong
if you want to do some more special
effects stuff you had more sophisticated
stuff in this make sure to check out my
keys channel glam and gore the link is
down below if I get this subscribe also
don't forget to check out the collab we
filmed on Mikey's channel what did we do
Mikey it was wild let me check it so now
my favorite part we're gonna do some
peel porn
it's a safe Mikey since you are a
consenting adult yes you should take it
off the proper way with isopropyl
myristate yeah but I always peel the
liquid latex off and that's why we're
gonna live like on the edge right now
all right let's peel ready
oh you're stuck I didn't get the hollows
stuck on me what the cuz I'm really
hollow inside all right well you two
