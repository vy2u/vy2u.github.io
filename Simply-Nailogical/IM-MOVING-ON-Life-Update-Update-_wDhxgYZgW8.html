I don't think you've seen this clip
enough times yet so I'm going to play it
again as you all know recently I gave
you guys a life update because I broke
my fucking nail okay guys look at this
and now empathize with my tragic life I
made another video showing you guys how
I thought i fixed my nail but I didn't
really fix it did I it was just a
temporary solution a band-aid that I
could wear until the breaks grew out
enough that I could cut it down look at
that nail gap it's sexier than anything
I guess I've ever seen before we take
this off I'm going to play doctor and
assess the situation we can see that the
nail break has grown past the fingertip
on one side it used to be this one and
if I push down my fingertip enough we
can finally see the break on the other
side oh that one was beep another reason
why I can't really wait any longer is
that my C curve is like a really hard C
the two breaks on each side have
obviously served as a point of weakness
for my nail and so they're pulling and
bending inwards way more than my nails
would naturally do normally I can say
one of my nails in my future but I
cannot sit in this one it's so tight
Roger Jesus yeah oh but hey wait a
second what's that on my other hand it's
a beautiful purple polish with shifting
pink shimmers and some scattered hollow
from a brand new brand I put the link
down below a brand new brand and I have
to say it's quite collapse I don't know
if I should be allowed to wear this now
because I had used gel polish to keep
this on and check a cotton pad soaked in
acetone pressed down on my finger and
wrapped in tin foil to protect it from
alien for whatever reason I only left it
on for a minute and so it only partly
dissolves and looks like a newt oops so
let's try it is that game now I'm oiling
myself up with a nail
oil pen that I made myself because the
acetone dryness makes you look nasty
here we go again and this time I
actually left it on for 10 full minutes
oh there we go now there's still a lot
of gel shit and some nail glue it
appears left on my now so I got to
gently scrape that off but the good news
is I'm not feeling any pain from the
pressure of doing this so that means
that the nail break is probably just
past my finger enough that it doesn't
kill me oh look at all that nasty glue
shit see what I mean by temporary
solution it's entirely possible to just
patch a broken nail or use some nail
glue or the tea bag approach but for me
I always feel like it's a liability I
always have to be more careful because I
know it can bend inwards or break easier
I just prefer to just chop it off when
it's possible and not painful to do so
and start fresh the break is still
pretty low but it's not danger level low
like it used to be and the other side is
doing a lot better it's time to perform
surgery my friend with the direct nail
clippers
normally I would never use these and
I'll show you why in a minute but in
this case I don't really have a choice
because filing it will probably just
hurt more Oh sir I don't want to let go
man here look at that glue lifting up it
just wanted to come off oh oh oh my god
hey maybe I'll keep this nail shape and
now for some final clippings now I'm
just going to take a glass nail file and
smooth out the edges and isn't it
interesting which you can see the trauma
caused from the nail break as evidenced
by the little slope in my smile line
that's the white pit part towards dandy
or now or in my case the yellow pit part
so yes my nail is scarred my emotions
are Scott until I can put this behind me
and move on from the trauma and we can't
just leave the middle finger over the
family looking like this so we're going
to have to file the rest of her family
down from sorry guys I'm going to take
this opportunity to show you why you
shouldn't use nail clippers because when
you do that you're now my actually split
below the spot you intended to clip and
this is because you're putting so much
pressure and stress on your nail it may
snap fray or break lower than you meant
to but I just did that to demonstrate
and then I filed them down the rest of
the way when my nails is this short my T
curve relaxes by a lot so it's barely
see anymore how am I supposed to spell
my name on snapchat I haven't had my
nails this short in such a long time
that the sensation of putting my finger
tips on objects is so weird to me how am
I supposed to scratch my cats huh wow my
nails may be short but their length
won't stop me from being myself man I'll
know what to say okay positive clouds
about moving on tumblr what do we got
sometimes you got to let things go for
better things to arrive yeah that's good
I am in the process of becoming the best
version of myself forgiveness is a gift
you give yourself that doesn't really
make sense in this context but nevermind
happen for everything it is what it is
it's not what it should have been not
what it could
then it it is what it is what the fuck
are you saying okay fuck this we go and
do what we want we don't need no
bullshit positivity clothes to feel
better instead we're just going to slap
some black hollow wig down on it
that's all we need really apply a peel
off base coat pin on your first layer of
black Halloween now load up a makeup
sponge with some of that good black
hollow dab that shit on that damn damn
damn oh yes I'm starting to feel like
myself again
I had one final coat of it cuz why not
let's go out and to stick coats of nice
and glassy taffeta oh yay don't forget
to wrap the tip and since I have short
nails for the first time in a long time
I can show you guys how to fix what
happens when you wrap the tip if your
nails are short enough that your glass
attacker gets on your fingertips as soon
as you swipe it on take an orange stick
and swipe it right off your skin if it
didn't come off completely then just
take a cleanup brush dipped in acetone
and gently rub it off see it is possible
to wrap the tips with short nails
very important everyone must wrap the
tip now I'm slapping on some nail oil
all over so I can help my little guys
grow and I am going to make a video on
this in a couple months when I've
actually grown my nail so stay tuned for
that but look at my nails
is mesmerising this beautiful I believe
we can recover from this my friends I
would like to give a shout out to all
you out there for your unconditional and
unwavering support during this very
difficult time in my life thank you for
appreciating my videos even if it's not
me painting my nails you the best man
alright then thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
