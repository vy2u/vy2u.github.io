everyone it's me Christine and as you
may already know we did it we reached 1
million hallo sexuals on Instagram and
to celebrate I did these Instagram nails
oh and we're also having this minor
giveaway just a small giveaway the
giveaway is being hosted on Instagram
but you can go watch my giveaway video
on YouTube to see what you can win this
giveaway ends on April 24th so if you're
watching after that don't worry you
might be able to unlock the next
giveaway anyways in my giveaway video if
you have superior holo identification
abilities you may have noticed that I
was sporting some holographic Instagram
nails so let me show you how I did these
nails because everyone wants to put the
Instagram logo on their nails I'm
starting off with a peel off base coat
because obviously I need to be able to
peel off this milestone so I can save it
so now I'm applying a black polish which
is nothing to do with the Instagram
nails that you just saw I actually did a
whole bunch of crap on my nails cuz I
had an idea to make some things with
foil but it didn't work out at all but
as you guys know I like to show you my
fails so that pink with some liquid
latex from bundle monster and I added
some foil glue and some hollow gold foil
oh my god see now this is where I
thought I was extremely clever by
drawing the number 1 with liquid latex
she couldn't really tell it's the number
1 I also drew the letter M on my other
nail 4,000,000 like 1 million 1 M you
know
letters worked at first and that was
just a complete disaster I don't know
what happened there
I don't think foil glue agrees with
liquid latex just put it that way I
tried to save the messy outlines by
adding a pink foil but yeah teton work
either what the hell is this I'm not
sure what that gold hollow foil sure has
potential I'll have to use it again
sometime so I peeled it all off because
I was not satisfied this is not the way
to celebrate 1 million homosexuals
and we gotta start over peel off base
coat then we're going to make the
background of the Instagram logo which
is supposed to be a boring beige but
we're gonna make it Hollow I'm using
this beautiful nude champagne hollow
that is sure to convert Instagram to
hollow sexuality like honestly who
chooses a plain boring creamy face is
the main color in their logo why would
you ever do that it is so boring
but even beige isn't boring when it's
hollow at a quick dry taco because
you're getting hungry oh yeah
linear hollow comes to life under the
light I love you so much
the reason why you just added a quick
dry top coat because I should probably
explain things to you is because we're
going to be adding acrylic paint next an
acrylic paint is easiest to apply over
top of a topcoat that has dried so that
you can scratch it off if you up Oh
guys help me I'm distracted I can't get
away from the hollow look at all the
rainbows it's over ha ha ha so next
you're gonna take a brush that paints
I'm using the double zero one from
twinkle teeth then you're gonna paint
some brown acrylic paint on the tip of
your nail just the tip nail videos are
so easy to make tip jokes in let it dry
in between coats because you're going to
need to apply two or three coats of this
paint to make it look opaque and like
you just dip the tip of your nails in a
pile of perfect Instagram your logo
is so attractive
next I'm taking a much skinnier nail-art
brush and mixing a little bit of black
acrylic paint with some white because
we're gonna paint the outer ring of the
lens now this is why I never do free
hand because do you see how my hand is
shaking literally having a panic attack
right now the filling in the circle part
is not as stressful so that's a nice
break and I don't know is that a circle
is that a circle guys does it look like
a circle to you it's kind of uneven
actually maybe I should make it bigger
and even it up I don't know this could
be a terrible decision Kristine why do
you do this to yourself you always make
it work now the lens is much bigger than
I originally intended it in between
colors you can just rinse off your brush
with water that's one of the reasons why
I like using acrylic paint when you're
doing tiny details like this which I
rarely do anyways because it also
requires a lot of talent the other
reason why I prefer to use acrylic paint
instead of nail polish when painting
tiny things like this is because then
the tiny elves are on my side no really
though it's because acrylic paint is a
lot thinner and therefore smoother and
that makes it just easier to apply
because nail polish can get a little bit
goopy and you can't scratch off nail
polish like this can you it's the
toothpick trick does anyone remember
that from one of my super early old
videos use a toothpick to erase all your
mistakes and shape whatever mess you
just drew into something that makes
sense
so next I'm gonna take a little bit of
black polish black pop no no it's not
polish it's acrylic paint Christine stop
it you're confusing the people makes the
black acrylic paint with some Brown
acrylic paint because we're gonna make a
slightly lighter part of the lens if
that makes sense acrylic paint dry so
matte weird now I've got to make the
little white reflection thingies in the
lens so that it looks like a lens except
I am very nervous doing this part this
is what's going through my head huh
don't touch it
barely touch it oh I'm shaking don't
 it up please okay we did good now
stop touching it and now it's time for
instagrams half-ass attempt at a rainbow
so we got blue green yellow and red
nails are so curved which makes this
very hard if you're new here I say this
in almost every video this is a seeker
it's when your nails look like a C the C
stands for Christine of course to
counteract the curviness of my nail I
just made the red stripe a little
thicker because you're not gonna see
like half of it and we add the yellow
stray and then the green stripe and then
the blue stripe yes I am still
experiencing much freehand stress I
can't take it I hate it shoulda used
nail vinyls now we got to paint that
weird thing that sits under the rainbow
I don't even know what that is I think
the word insta is supposed to be written
under there but there is no way in hell
I'm going to paint that all right on to
my other nail now I'm trying to make
orange because that is the color of
Instagram notifications except for some
reason red and yellow don't want to make
orange like what is this this looks like
salmon color the color theory principles
I learned in grade 3 are not working
suppose I could just use orange nail
polish but painting with acrylic paint
is so much easier then we'll just have
to do with this ugly muddy color orange
so I'm just painting the rounded
rectangle notification box thingy except
I'm painting it vertically as opposed to
horizontally because there's no way it
could fit on my nail the other way
around add a couple coats of that nasty
color orange and now I'm gonna try and
paint follower icon and then one em
everyone hold your breath hold your
breath right now
what is that it's not the cleanest of
lines but it works okay and now just do
a little shake do a little dance while
you're painting on the one
some people find freehand painting
relaxing or stress relieving I don't I
find it extremely stressful it makes me
want to break down into tears I'm always
worried I'm just gonna everything
up with one stroke well the toothpick
fix my mistakes no not really because
you can't scratch acrylic paint off of
acrylic paint okay whatever I'm moving
I'm gonna paint a little quotation
thingy at the bottom of the notification
bubble and we're done
whew it only took me five hours of
stress and now we must protect the inks
to peace by adding a nice thick coat of
glossy taco your fingers can't function
anymore and you get the top coat all
over your skin simply take an orange
stick and wipe it away add the glossy
tacos on all your nails clean up the
glossy taco from all your nails now you
see how after the glossy taco dries it's
a little bit bumpy acrylic paint always
does that I don't know why so whenever
you do use acrylic paint make sure to
add to thick coats of glassy tacos so
basically you need two tacos to seal in
your design and give a beautiful shine
jk jk I'm JK look it's my Instagram
nails with my Instagram except I filmed
this before I hit 1 million what do you
think I work that fast no I get the
impression that not everyone even knows
that I have an Instagram account but the
truth is I started my nail stuff on
Instagram so if you're only watching me
on YouTube and not follow me on
Instagram you should definitely go
follow me on Instagram that's where my
sassiness first started out I mean it
started out in Instagram captions and
then it came to YouTube later also some
people seem to be concerned that
Bellaire impersonating me on Instagram
these are all the accounts I own I also
run simply not logical which is a
feature account where I post other
people's videos and you can use the
hashtag simply not logical for a chance
to be featured and men'she the cat
that's my daughter she posts herself and
Zeiler the cat that's my son he is a
cynical prick sometimes and I hope you
guys enjoy these Instagram nails
obviously you don't have to write one em
in there you can write whatever you want
oh hey we forgot to do what's on my
other hand you guys think I forgot
didn't you oh of course not I did
I'm wearing this gorgeous purple vibrant
Hollow that is one of the polishes up
for grabs in my giveaway this is
probably the sexiest linear holo ever
because the color is so bright it's
brighter than my future alright guys

supports me and all the crazy I
like to do on this channel and on my
Instagram there would be no simply no
