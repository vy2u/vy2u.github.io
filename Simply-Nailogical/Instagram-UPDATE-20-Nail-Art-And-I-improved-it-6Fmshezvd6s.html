would be nice to ease into this video
tutorial with some peel porn rub me down
with that oil girl hmm poke it under a
pillow me don't mind the meji air oh
let's do it again once do you peel for
me girl
peel the peel is real I just want to
collect all your peel ease keep them
under my pillow now that you are
officially confused with what's the hell
kind of video you're watching you should
subscribe to my channel you will always
be surprised I promise now does anyone
remember when I did these nails and then
said this the new Instagram update is
hollow we asked for hollow and they gave
us rainbow so close enough Instagram
will come around to its hollow sexuality
eventually okay but for now I just put
my own hollow taco on it to fix their
logo it's also a gradient and if you
didn't know that's the only kind of nail
art talent that I have let's get started
with the peel off base coat yay except
I'm still wearing these nails as I make
this tutorial so you're not gonna get
the peel porn at the end I'm sorry guys
that's why I put a different field horn
at the beginning next add some white
polish because colors show a best over
white rainbows are good but not when
they're in the form of nail polish stuck
to your skin so protect yourself go with
some liquid latex put it all up around
your skin and up and your cuticle while
you're letting that dry for a couple
minutes you can go pick up some neon
polishes I actually really liked
instagrams color scheme okay I'm proud
of you even if PowerPoint was your
inspiration I'm still proud but even if
PowerPoint makes that gradient look easy
it's actually a lot harder to do it
yourself on a sponge without a computer
so I tried my best to match the colors
and placements of the gradient behind
the new Instagram logo and well we'll
see you can test out the sizing and
stuff just by dabbing the sponge on a
white piece of paper
to the pit does it fit okay kind of
works alright let go just give a little
dab dab dab to that instant and yeah see
what I mean it's not as easy as
PowerPoint for any beautifully blended
gradients you're going to need to do
several thin layers of Polish I mean
polish dabbing you're better off doing
multiple thin layers of the gradient and
just letting the polish dry a little bit
in between each layer and doing really
thick gloppy coats of the gradient
because it's just gonna turn into a mess
kind of like that other thing I know a
lot about putting multiple layers on
yeah I'm starting to make better and
there's a cat hair again there is no
escape eight layers later when I was
finally happy with the gravy influent it
was time to peel off simply peel like no
big deal
so much peeling on this channel yet and
this is the unfortunate time when you
push too hard with your gradient sponge
and you put the shit in your cuticles
anyways lucky for me that yellow was a
stamping polish which means it's one of
the most possibly opaque polishes ever
and now I have yellow cuticles for life
I know how Big Bird feels self next
we're gonna add a quick dry top coat
which is crucial to doing the actual
part of this nail design that makes it
Instagram logo inspired you're gonna let
that dry like Melanie Martinez when she
gets out of a bath of soap then you're
going to take some white acrylic paint
because we're going to be painting with
it so you'll also need a paintbrush
I just realized everything is white on
the screen so you can't really see what
I'm doing
sometimes I add a bit of water to the
acrylic paint because it makes it easier
to work with and now I'm just going to
practice my freehand painting skills and
this is what a rounded square looks like
now remember if you want to use the
trick that I'm about to show you you can
only take the acrylic paint on if the
top coat underneath is fully dry so
actually did the second part the next
day but you could do it probably an hour
after depends on
you're quick to our tacos in any case
watch me draw a square I'm sorry you
know not everyone has a steady hand guys
talent comes in many forms one of my
talents is problem-solving and I have
figured out what to do when I fuck up my
nails and I'd like to share that talent
with you because I truly believe this
challenge is a highly transferable skill
this is one of the tricks I showed in my
20 DIY nail art hack you take a
toothpick and you gently scratch off any
mistakes you made your lines too thick
no problem your edges weren't round no
problem you scratched off something you
didn't mean to scratch off no problem
we're gonna fill it in shortly because
the acrylic paint kind of turns to dust
when you start to scratch at it all you
got to do is just dust it off with a dry
brush and yeah so basically you could
just keep going back and forth with
adding paint and then scratching it off
and adding more paint and scratching it
off again as you continually try and
perfect that rounded square at some
point or another you gotta call it quits
so I think that's right now for me I'm
done next you're going to draw the
circle inside the rounded square
Instagram is so creative with their
shape if you can't fit a square peg in a
round hole can you fit a round peg in a
rounded square hole Instagram you must
answer mate to be honest this doesn't
even look like a camera it's like a
donut with a rounded square like a
cronut but a rounded square donut a row
nut aronia yes I'm so hungry now wait a
second what are those fancy blue nails
doing all this toothpick action it's
time for what's on my other hand and oh
my god first of all please excuse the
fact that I've had this nail polish on
for over a week so it's kind of grown
out but this is one of the six new
colors of my own collaboration
collection of nail polish I don't write
well what what and this one's called how
deep is your hollow is it like the ocean
well it's not called the
carts homie called the first part but
you may remember why my brand-new
collection is a collaboration with fun
lacquer one of my favorite hollow
glitter makers and it will be released
on May 21st and yes I'm gonna have a
nail porn dedicated to my new collection
you just gotta give me some time to edit
that nail porn because I got to give it
some tender loving and care but in the
meantime you can follow me on my 1,800
different social media platforms to get
all the latest updates in the collection
including speak peeks of my own pictures
and videos I'm so excited there's no
Mahalo
okay stop it Christine you must focus
you must finish these nails that you've
committed to doing earlier in this very
same video finally we finish off this
strange looking logo with a white dot
and now it looks like a dishwasher or a
keychain or maybe an earring I don't
know and yeah now it's pretty obvious I
did way too many coats on my middle
finger and that's why the purple is so
much darker than the other fingers it's
no going back now and now to give
Instagram the update it always deserved
but it never gave itself despite the
billions of dollars it has in its
offshore accounts we're gonna make
Instagram hollow again well not again
but just make Instagram hollow when
you're done you can add another regular
click dry top coat to seal everything
all in and make it super shiny now that
I'm done and my nails are insta flake I
really hope that Instagram doesn't
update its logo in a week and render
these nails irrelevant again you hear
that Instagram listen up the only update
you are allowed to add is a holo update
Instagram two-point holo you know what's
weird though even though the app is all
rainbow it's really just leaving because
the actual app once you click into it
it's very plain and basic and white and
I don't see any other rainbows of
all these amazing nail art posts oh yeah
this cage isn't mine my personal page is
simply no logical and this one
accidentally not logical is my feature
page oh that's my face though make sure
you're following me on all the social
media and hey oh if you're not
subscribed to my youtube channel here's
