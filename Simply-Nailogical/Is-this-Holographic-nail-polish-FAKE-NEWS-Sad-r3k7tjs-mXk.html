everyone it's me Christine again don't
mind my makeup I was trying to be edgy
just pretend it's not on my face today
we have some very important business to
discuss
recently together we've discovered that
a lot of makeup companies have been
using the word hollow short for
holographic to advertise things that
aren't hollow and you know what we can
kind of turn a blind eye and forgive
them because we know makeup companies
they just don't under
but you know who should our nail polish
companies but then I saw this
you
I don't know about you but this looks
like click base to me but I had to buy
them for research purposes first
impression they come in three colors
purple blue and pink interesting how
they are all called unique hmm six
dollars ninety cents Canadian eh that's
the case oh it has you me any good
Canadian would notice that French is
incorrect it should be fabricate Jose
judging me okay shame shame how about we
read the description together
holographic nail polish featuring a pink
shade and a cap with a brush applicator
Wow I'm glad that there's a cap in a
brush applicator that comes with this
nail polish no reviews where's the
hollow section once let's take a closer
look shall we
I see purple shimmers and blue shimmers
and this one and I would've thought pink
but more like blue green shimmers in
that one but I don't see any Hollow sure
it's pretty and I would call this
iridescent shimmer because it shifts
slightly in color but there are no
actual holographic pigments in this
goddamn bottle what is so hard to
understand in case you're new here I'm I
gotta do a better job by presenting it
this is hollow okay
it has magical special pigments in it
that shift the spectrum of the rainbow
Paulo can come in different colors but
at the end of the day they're all still
Hollow they're not lies and so I
question
you know why they put holographic right
on the front of the bottle but should be
fair enough complaining let's hold off
on the roasts for a bit and put these on
our nails because I love torturing
myself what a shame I have to take off
real hallow foresee a colo mmm peel porn
that you didn't know you were getting a
show today I'm applying some peel-off
base coat first because I know I'm going
to want to peel the shit off my nails
immediately me no bias researchers yes
my nails are shorties again do like
NATO's cube polish versions now we're
going to corrupt them with this bullshit
let's turn the blue first
oh hey wait a second this little
asterisk on the file there's a footnote
at the bottom that says we know this is
in holo we just want to capitalize on
the holo market oh oh wow now let's do
two coats so we can see the final
results nope don't not Hollow
this is Hollow little my friends Oh Oh
what is that what's on my other hand
it's actually fucking Hollow no way it's
a beautiful light blue polish for
shifting purple shimmer tossed with a
hollow taco who creates this fantastic
beautiful whimsical effect and ended
triggers no one of all companies you
would expect this nail polish people
know what
hollow it this is just another case of
fake news very sad who made this who did
this who is responsible for this
distributed by forever 21 I suppose
they're not really a real nail polish
company should we tell them all so now
we know that forever 21 will never
sponsor me after this this is an April
Fool's joke right generally I don't
believe in dragging people or companies
you know because like it's just me but
he's deserved to be dragged behind a
pickup truck on a road of gravel with
zombies eating them are you sure you're
not from a makeup company could be sure
sound like one with these lives they
obviously dropped out of hollow college
otherwise they would know better you
know what happens to fake news products
like this they get it put in the hollow
of shame roast and well we have
concluded that this is false advertising
I will not stand by these alternative
facts looks like we'll have to see you
in court this should actually be a crime
this is illegal I'm allowed to say that
after seeing these and experiencing them
I feel personally attacked they are
insulting my religion you know what
forever21 I'm disappointed in you I've
seen all those pouches we know you sell
all these hollow things it makes me sad
when people use the word holographic
to sell shit and then customers buy it
not knowing the truth we don't need this
kind of negativity in our lives
no we don't I would say can't see the
haters finded by the hollow but they're
not fucking hollow when will the torture
and they didn't just write hallo okay it
says hallo
Grassi how dare they do follow a full
name on the bottle I'm going to do you
guys a favor and share some safe words
that companies like this can use instant
iridescent pearlescent opalescent
color-shifting or just stings blue pink
or purple why don't you teach us a
little more about actual hollow don't
mind if I do
look it's purple Hollow another purple
Hollow
matte purple Hollow pink hollow light
pink hollow not pink hollow little
Hollow a light blue hollow not blue
hollow and just for educational purposes
silver hollow and black hollow there you
go kids
now you're fully educated now based on
my experience with these types of
iridescent shimmer polishes I would say
that they often in fact look better over
dark colors or black so let's give that
a shot because again tired of roasting
everything here's the purple shimmer
over black very galaxy esque
and when you put the blue over black you
get pink yes I use this blue over black
to get it and then when you put the pink
over black you get blue quite the mind
sprite I mean they are pretty it's just
nothing new we haven't already seen
before in nail polish land but they
definitely not hallow
we need to kill them and make it look
like an accident
simply murders logical now you can't lie
to anyone else Kenya and that's where
non holographic but label collagraph the
colleges go to die sometimes you just
don't know who you can trust anymore
it's a sad time we live in if you're
looking for actual hollow nail polish
and I mean the good shit the real shit
you can find a bunch of them
I feel like down below in the video
description box I have the same links in
all of my video description boxes
because I believe it's very important to
spread the hollow message we are not
Homo sapiens we are Hollow sapiens all
right guys
hollow sexual out of the building don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
want to follow the hollow path and
thanks so much for watching I'll see on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
