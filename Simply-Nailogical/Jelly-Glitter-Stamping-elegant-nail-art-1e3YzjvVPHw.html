gonna try making nails on a mat yeah I
don't know how this is gonna go over
either but uber chic reached out to me
recently and sent over all this stuff
and seduce me with hollow glitter and I
was like okay
uber chic is an indie stamping plate
company that started about a year ago
and they also sell some other nail art
stuff but their biggest product is the
uber matte which apparently they
invented after ruining furniture so now
that I know how to stamp well sort of
let's play with uber chic stampers and
plates but first its experiment time on
this matte thing because I got to figure
out how the hell to use it first before
I show you how to use it look you can
use it to test color combos although I
always know that any holo color
combination is a good one because it's
hollow and there's rainbows and you can
use the uber matte to make drag marble
decals or decals Nicole's decals decals
at whatever I don't care how you say it
but it's like all those Russians you see
doing this except we need to do it on a
mat multiple times to practice clearly I
don't know what these patterns are
supposed to be but I never said I was
trying to do anything that looked good
but you get the point of how you can use
this mat then you would just peel them
off when they're dry and hoops I think
this is why you're supposed to put a top
coat down first on the mat
all right let's experiment with
something else how about some stamping
look I have excellent aptitude and this
time I put a top go down first
well now I'm kind of making a big mess
all over my bad but it's fine because
it's not on my table it's on my net and
I'll clean it up easily soon just wait
so after I've scraped and stamped my
stamping plate I take the Stamper and
roll the head over the top coat on the
mat and now you can create a little
canvas space just for yourself to fill
in the stamping faces with different
color hollows this technique is called
advanced or reverse stamping and I'm
just using a small dotting tool to fill
in the flower petals you could also use
a small paintbrush I'm lazy and I'm not
cleaning my tool in between colors but
I'm just wiping it off on the mat
because I don't care you'll see soon how
it's really easy to clean up this is
almost as fun as filling out all those
sailormoon coloring books I used to do
when I was a child when you're done and
it's all dry about 10 to 15 minutes peel
it up very gently see how the top coat
looks so nice see why you need a top
coat it's so necessary flip it over and
there's your DIY decal yes don't worry
guys the holo isn't gone once you put it
on your nail and then add a topcoat the
holo order of the universe is restored
I didn't put this on my nails because
that was just for fun along with all
these other experiments that I did that
didn't work out too well and now I've
got a mess all over my mat but what do I
do
not that much actually it's super easy
to clean just peel up any large pieces
of dried polish and then take some
acetone or nail polish remover and just
wipe away the rest of it with the cotton
soaked pad the uber matte is completely
resistant to acetone and nail polish
remover now if only my house were this
easy to clean okay let's begin for real
and we're gonna make these nails now I
start off by applying top coat down on
the mat in five different spaces I'm
gonna do for each of my five nails but
if you're a normal person then you
probably want to plan for ten nails then
I just take some black stamping polish
this one from Mexico I had pretty sure
its car paint and scrape it over the
plate using an uber chic credit card
like thingy I'm pretty sure this is the
Excel sticky Stamper head by uber chic
that I'm using cuz it's kind of sticky
but what the hell do I know bugs
stamping I don't know all I know is
that right away it had to roll the
Stamper over the top coat on my mat and
then look at all of my creations next I
take some sheer jelly polish and I'm
just gonna make a very sheer blend with
green on one side and right on the other
cuz Christmas is soon these are
definitely like the kind of nails you
would wear to one of those upscale
dinner parties that your boyfriend
stuck-up parents are hosting at the
Country Club you know like the opposite
of an ugly Christmas sweater party oh
yeah I have nails I almost forgot let's
paint them I'm just using some OPI
silver chrome polish as a base because
I'm gonna cover it in silver hollow
glitter this is uber chic CIP lists
silver holographic glitter dust but I
really wanted to use the black holla one
but I knew that it wouldn't work with
the black stamping in any case just dump
your hollow glitter over top of your wet
polish and use a fan brush to lightly
brush it off your finger glitter may get
everywhere but when life gives you
glitter make glitter coke lines and
be sure to split it with your friends
because after all the holiday season is
the time of giving
here you go friends sniff up you're
welcome I just cleaned up the coke party
with the uber chic credit card thing in
my fan brush and put it back into the
container for next time okay back to
things on the mat peel off your
self-made decals carefully and then the
idea is that you're gonna stick these on
your nail over top of the glitter so
that the glitter shows through the clear
part of the jelly thingy you could just
stick this massive piece right over your
nail and then cut around the edges and
just solve for the edges with acetone
but I prefer to cut it out beforehand as
close as possible to the shape of my
nail before sticking it on mostly
because I still can't find those magical
Russian scissors just take some topcoat
or clear nail polish and put it on your
nail to make it wet so that the decal
will stick and just press the deagle
down gently all around your nail to
quote-unquote seal the edges you just
take a cleanup brush dipped in acetone
and gently press around the edges of the
nail add a final glossy top coat to
bring out all that holo sparkle under
the jelly decal and bam this is the most
elegant and sophisticated my nails have
been since ever well that was pretty
easy and awesome right there's so many
possibilities with this matte you can
find the stamping and glitter product
and the uber map that I used in this
video at uber sheiks website I put the
link down below and don't forget you can
use my code simply for 10% off your
entire order thanks so much for watching
guys bye hollow bye hollow bye hollow
