you guys on my videos about how I remind
you of other people I mean what is this
can't we just all be individuals I would
play the audio of some of them to give
you a reference point but I'm afraid of
the YouTube copyright police you Taylor
Swift's people so apparently a lot of
you think that I'm a wannabe jenna
Marbles and then I copy everything she
does I just want to apologize for that
because I did not realize that she was
the only sarcastic female allowed on
YouTube my bad my bad I did buy some red
