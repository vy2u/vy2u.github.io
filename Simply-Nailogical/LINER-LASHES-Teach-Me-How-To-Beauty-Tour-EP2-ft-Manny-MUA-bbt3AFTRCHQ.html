masculine like I'm here today because I
would really like to learn how this to
do my eyes I would love to teach you
wait I gotta say your line if you don't
like it don't you watch it yeah what a
beauty guru I personally think you're
amazing at your staple liquid liner and
then you always have on fake eyelashes
yeah always they're fake right those are
real yeah I would definitely think I
looked like neutral eye or like
something more bold than the eye and
then always be always having wings and
always having lashes I have my makeup
with me here okay great so I'm gonna try
and copy you mm-hmm
I'm so excited oh so excited into
something sickening but like very
everyday evening I'm okay sickening okay
come are feeling a little hot I'm ready
oh we're going straight to hell we sure
are
yeah so are I'm already game already
going big I brought brushes in this in
morphia they look like a morphic use use
code simply for 10% typical well no or
you so many of you later do okay guru I
by 87 brushes because digital tell them
to I didn't bring all a 7x no 7 using
for about 12 years
well we're not going to use that okay oh
I seen that already right but first
need a primer eyelid this is an
important Optimus Prime Amazon Prime oh
just a little lid of you tog referred
that goddamn so you have eye primer no
kind of yeah to be living here in my
nails don't agree that he's going to put
it on to the center they go up fire all
the way up to your brow bone that's not
that oh my god does it matter what color
this is this is like a skin tone skin
tone so we kind of want it to be more of
a skin tone shaping if you have a convey
near eyelids I you painted yours from
coke to now we're going to take a big
fluffy brush you're going to wipe it
over just to get a little bit of a sick
idea yeah I mean you really it's guys
it's hard to mess up primer just me real
hard okay guys so now are we ready going
with a fluffy brush
that's not fluffy enough so I'll fluffy
we're going to take a color like this
I'm going to dust off all I love seeing
this happen
yes literally we're just invested on
what's on the outer corner is one
deposit more color there this is just to
have a transition color down brick I
think you're freaking technically is up
here no it's not that is like that's
where you're that's where your brow bone
ends that's our end I should your eyelid
fold is here yeah
oh orbit bone guys really sit wherever
it Bob
orbital bone oh my god to call that is a
crease right there it's all going to
turn into wrinkles there's a lot of
adults oh no I don't do that no you
don't really do that as what's in Canada
or a leaf is not offered like when
you're in the grocery store here I feel
like a good you like a banana all we
also sell motox easy so it looks really
pretty super easy super natural we're
get a little bit a stress on the outer
corner press lightly on I'm going to be
a little like slight just back and forth
motion into the crease I can only tell
you're depositing or Chloe looks great
you can see there's more definition
outer corner I'm doing a great job okay
great I looks really really good I'm
very in fact how would you grade me I'll
give you a good deep V I can do better
than that
let me check out yours all right I give
you a b-plus
right right three colors it's really
really easy really simple and very just
like you can do it every day think I
have time for that shit
maybe okay I don't want makeup Monday to
Friday
but I need to be a beauty here okay shut
up okay so what you're going to go in
with is this guy right here
I'd like to your complexion to your
lighter complexion things really stand
out really nicely a ste white girl you
are you are here are your white bitch
where's my Starbucks
mm-hmm-hmm okay pick up some product as
you can see why don't you use one of
these but they're so good I like packing
know the shimmer no I swear I've done my
five makeup videos your logo what we
want to do you want to have an intense
eye you can spray it with Express or
spray with Tennant water sorry or not
spritz it with a little boom I have
nightmares because it looks like spray
nail polish there we go oh my how are
you were going to take it about two
right here even when your eyes are open
you can still see it that's the goal you
want to be able to have your make no you
don't want to get out here because we
got okay
shit I I'm sorry getting a little
carried away
no I thought I was born with it maybe
I'm just maybe not a me so it's like all
the following I you only have little
specks here yeah so we want to avoid
that that's like fallout so it's kind of
it's kind of hard to wipe off sobota
like fallout boy mm-hmm fallout girl or
something lightly blend back and for it
mm-hmm yes like that
yeah I'm really liking are you doing
greener yay so what would you grade me
on the eyeshadow b-plus
I thought I was improving the question
go and I'm doing here now it's the
Kahuna
I have liner I never use it make up
forevers professional aqua liar I
believe I got it when I would mix team
is that 16 you know how like things say
they're expired it but they're not that
really fine I'm not going to die right
no you're going to be fine are there
like chances you don't start towards the
inner corner you start you want to start
towards the outer because usually the
outer is more thick and tricks man
that's what they don't tell you that's
what the beautiful people don't tell you
maybe you should supervise I will trace
along your real lashes boom
so what do you do right it's I the inner
tears where I cry at nights for me I'd
like to go a little bit past a very real
lashes up ground like right here yeah is
that normal
I don't that's it yours already in there
oh is it okay okay yours is like already
like yours is great like I think you
didn't find out that you're getting a
name I'm getting it at 100 yeah man
thank you Ben Ben got the tea what do
you think what do you think what do you
think not done about what do you think
anyway looking good right thanks man
so a wing with this is a lot easier to
do than a wing with that like to feel
mind go to a smaller pump in your sense
this is a sponge I like you move along
so okay so because that's literally a
felt-tip pen all the liners are the same
it's just marketing right black or what
I'm gonna watch you first okay so I
suppose I'm just going to click in slow
motion
Wow that's a line that's a fucking
laying don't let it fly away now uh I
know he just follow it in wow you make
it look so easy how it is you you shit
that looks good okay now I'm nervous the
other stuff I was like I got this
I'm good good but now like for me this
is more of a settling for me I would
usually take it out farther it's not all
it's cuz it's more sin to like if I want
it to be more intense I'd be like it
senses your fear boom you can like
butyrate doc you wanted to you're gonna
drag it it let me reload some a room
that's great really that's not too much
mm-hmm okay there you go that's a lot
like I think it's really bold for you
like is that intense mm-hmm it was the
other way fair well mine is sharper
we're going to make your sharper to
achievement yeah how can I keep your
concealer or foundation and just taking
some concealer then from the bottom of
your liner we're gonna sweep it back and
it just kind of cleans up everything hmm
oh my God look at that it's already
sharp it's ah yeah that's it just Pat it
on and boom you just take a little punch
it's a gradient Wow good I get an A I
get it I'm not really doing the winged
liner that often like I think you can
forever
I know Jerry 16 years old whoever
stabbed yourself in the eye like many a
time really many times what do you do do
you call 9-1-1 or no I just scream
that's giant that's a love once you get
the eyeliner crack but you can't give it
up yeah no I know you better try
cleaning it up and see what we got next
in eyelashes mm-hmm they're the curl
your lashes first of course what it's
corny lashes your real lashes
oh that's fingers did you go into your
eye the Kate week okay to your eyes oh
if you just go like this and
yeah mascara yes yay I'm appears well
that's um not fun just check does so
I've worn fake lashes a few times or
have tried to wear them and each time I
can't get them to stick on my nine ball
or I stick them like in the middle of my
eyelid you trim them yes especially for
your eye shape when you're of a small
because that's what everyone donated
need to trim them you want to trim from
the outer corner there's a lot of extra
space that's a lot right a lot so cut
that off perfect yeah that looks better
yeah much better so now you can use a
lash glue I always suggest a house of
lashes lash glue it's really intense
really strong on some lashes
okay washes washes they're in my diorama
where they make it mmm that were old
you're not gonna know they're like can I
guess I'm lashes on me honest yeah wait
at least a good 10 to 20 seconds you
don't want to apply right away because
not any stickiness oh so that I have
people go yes they have to wait a bit
amount of time press against the center
of my eye I'm so quick that yes so now
that's press off the center what you
want to do is you want to make sure the
inner part of this so wait a second you
put the fake lashes on your lashes we
think we put it on your skin so but it
is going technically washes yes I've
seen people do that oh my god section my
fingers but is dry do it soon uh-huh I
think I got it whoo look at that lash
where do you disaster what I depend the
best I've everything less should look
like after you Thomas oh let's go g Cote
mm-hmm that wasn't so bad
but life is on when you want to yeah
will be like once a month
no my lifelong dream is and my journey
to be a beauty guru what I want to pay
vacation oh we do a lot of them have a
very like one are you always good at
makeup no you can go back at all the way
