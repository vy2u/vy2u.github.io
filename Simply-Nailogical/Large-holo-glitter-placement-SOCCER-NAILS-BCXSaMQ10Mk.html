nails what else is new actually this is
new because it's hollow glitter
placement which means that I
individually placed every single one of
these hexagon-shaped loose glitters it
only took me about three hours of my
life which was a lot shorter than the
last glitter placement I did because
these glitters were a lot larger so it
took less time in any case don't do this
unless you're really bored yes my nails
are yellow we've been over this please
watch this video before you comment
something really stupid
I start off with the blue holographic
nail polish as a base this is I love
nail polishes honor rolls whose on the
honor roll comment below but it really
doesn't matter what she uses your base
polish color anyways because we're going
to cover the entire thing up with
glitter using to loose glitters from
twinkle tea one pinkish one and one blue
you can use my code simply for 10% off
your order of anything you die whether
it's hollow glitter or not hollow
glitter but if it's not hollow glitter
and we're not friends
sprinkle t cells these glitters in a
couple different sizes this is the
largest size they sell and I think they
call it the maxi size the worst part of
doing a glitter placement is cutting up
those stupid little hexagons into tiny
pieces you can fit it around the edges
of your nail this is probably why I
don't do glitter place much more often
but this is what you're supposed to do
to make it look good take a pair of
cuticle nippers or small scissors
those and before you get started chop a
couple hexagons in half you're gonna
need them and it's better to get the
worst part over with first kinda like
doing your homework before you do your
nails just kidding your your nails first
before we put them on the nail let's
decide what kind of pattern we're gonna
do I went with a soccer ball pattern
because it's kinda like summer even
though I've never played soccer my pink
glitters are supposed to be the white
parts of the ball and the blue glitters
are going to be the black but as you can
see the hollow just kind of makes it all
look rainbow so there's not really any
soccer ball pattern left is there
blinded by the hollow soccer is
irrelevant start by taking out a bottle
of clear polish not topcoat and add one
thin stripe down the center of your nail
only do one stripe at a time because the
clear polish will dry quickly start at
the base of the nail by picking up the
loose glitters one by one with the edge
of a toothpick you can lick the edge of
the toothpick to make and sticky
make sure to refer to your pattern
template before you put on the wrong
color in the wrong place roof of that
one fit right to the edge of the nail
that was lucky just adjust them by
moving them around a little if you need
to move it on to the second string add a
line of clear polish again and start
with your second row and here's that
dreaded part where the pieces of glitter
don't fit on your nail anymore thank God
you cut up all those pieces beforehand
right all right you get the idea right
super speed
why won't you fit I'm going to make you
fit stupid hexagons
what a stupid shape I don't even know
what the shape is anymore whatever next
and around the cuticle area is an
equally dreaded part of the glitter
placement so shove it in there like it
was meant to be
since my nail is actually quite curved
as opposed to flat I got to push the
glitters down with my finger and there
you're blinded by the hollow you didn't
even notice the mistakes around the
sides of the nail add a nice thick coat
of glossy top coat oh yeah who doesn't
find this satisfying girls look at that
shine look at those frame bows so many
rainbows I want to jump in them let's
watch that again on my other nail oh
yeah well you bring out all the colors
of the rainbow in me let's add a second
glossy top coat and no but seriously out
a second top coat because it helps to
seal in the glitter so they don't
accidentally come off in your daily life
and damn the world just forgot who Kasia
was I think these are definitely
appropriate for back-to-school now you
can just tell your gym teacher that you
have soccer on your nails so you don't
actually need to play with the rest of
the class oh there's a glitter in
my hair let's try and fish it oh yeah
why did I even try except the glitter
herpes and live with it well that looks
pretty sparkly doesn't it in the end you
probably didn't really need to make a
soccer ball powder did you as you could
have just put random colors of rainbow
holo all over your nails and it wouldn't
have mattered so some of you guys were
asking if you could send me stuff which
is kind of creepy but okay so I got
myself a p.o box which means you can
send me anything you want at this
address in Canada as long as it's legal
so in other words don't pull a van Gogh
and send me your ear I don't really want
any ransom letters and
I definitely prefer not to be sent in
rocks but feel free to send me stuff
related to nails or letters professing
your love for manche or just treats for
manche yeah that's right you can send
anything you want to men she is address
and I will be sure to give it to her if
I get enough ridiculous mail I may or
may not make a video on boxing at all
and hint hinge send me stuff alright see
you next time tap for some porn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
