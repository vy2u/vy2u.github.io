do not put your lips together hello
everyone it's me christine again welcome
back I'm simply faced logical also known
as simply now logical but in this video
I'm gonna do my face instead of my name
I'm a serious makeup guru okay don't let
my cat ears and all the nail polish
behind me fully I got a new camera can
you tell you see every little freckle
now I expect this camera to make me look
like nikkietutorials
is it working yet is it working yet I
ordered this to my house for some reason
I saw a bunch of my favorite Beauty
youtubers snap chatting about it and
 so I was like well obviously I had
to get it because there's hollow in it
you know what I'm saying
you can't not bar all I know is that
there's the shiny metallic eyeshadow or
lipsticks or body paints but they look
really cool and they come in a few
different colors I can't believe they
treat you is just decoration I want to
clear something up because I first saw
these advertised as holographic
eyeshadow pigments by some news company
that obviously isn't hollow sexual let's
be clear a gold sequins in the package
are in fact holographic but the
eyeshadow pigments or whatever are not
they're just metal as they were marketed
as metal I don't you just hate it when
people call ding hollow and it's not
disappointed they will never understand
they will never understand us it also
came with some water stuff in a little
water bottle when you mix them together
it looks like liquid metal Wow okay now
it's time to put some on my face
since simply face logical has already
done a video on how to put makeup on
your face you can go watch that video
alright let the fast-forward
begin I don't know how to raise the
other one now that I have a face - the
highlighter and the mascara we'll do
that later time to play with the metal
so I'm going to use the copper one as
opposed to the bronze one cuz they
looking almost exactly the same how
about we start with the creme copper
shadow first I'll put it on my eyeballs
what kind of brush are you supposed to
be used to put this on I use this
brush for some earlier I'll just
wipe it off alright here we go
Wow Oh shiny yeah I know I'm a beauty
guru cuz I'm saying yes I'm not really
sure why I did red here huh just like
red okay I'm just gonna bring it up a
little onto my really massive eyelids I
know you're so jealous of how much space
I have on my eyelids it's not like when
I fully open my eyes you know in order
to see it all gets covered and you can't
see all my hard work anyways I'm gonna
take the powdery version of it do it on
top of that now we know what they did
with the penny when they took it away
they ground it up and put it in this
makeup oh that's right okay umm
they took away the penny in Canada
because doesn't really make sense who
the buys anything for one cent or
with one two three or four cent
denomination nobody America still has
the penny though
then you just tap it on just pat pat pat
there's definitely that fell all
over my face I think they call that a
Fall Out Boy so you kind of have to just
like pack it in real hard
I'm just get I could put my eye
and just stay there bitch I'm Chinese
okay um how about we get even crazier
and put some like gold over here just
just be guys okay that's why
again I'm gonna start with the cream
because it's kind of sticky and kind of
wet I think you're supposed to use
something sticky or wet to stick powder
to I don't know I have three even washes
Jen I think you're gonna get actual
helpful beauty tips and advice from my
video but it looks pretty though so
that's all that matters I'm gonna put it
in the corner right here that way when I
cry I'll cry and gold I'm going
wild someone stopped me now let's do the
other eye all done now I realize that I
totally missed the opportunity to mix
the liquid with the powder and put
that on my eyes oops
don't worry we'll try that on my lips
let me finish off my eyeballs it came
with this black marker pretty sure it's
a sharpie or works really well oh yeah
now I really look like cat and now it's
time to put some eyelashes on my
eyelashes this is the look on my face
when I know doom is coming I hate this
 hmm are they sticking to me if I
have to hold them here just gonna ruin
oh my man works so hard on I mean simply
face logical is pretty good at many
things but one thing she is not good at
is putting on these condemned lashes
when did take lashes even become a trend
like I remember the days where you just
load it on a blow to mascara and called
it a day very sure that I pointed this
one too much down because it feels like
it's stabbing me and I okay now let's do
some highlighter bats I want to glow
bought this glow kid because a beauty
blogger told me so wonder if Pat McGrath
or whatever his name is has come out
with highlighters I would like that
simply the glue no strings you had a
little shine and if you ever saw her you
would see her blow her nose close her
now because I want to glow even more I
got this we're gonna use it for another
look sometime soon but for now pretty
doesn't really go with the like warm
coppers I got going on here but I'm
getting let's add some more
highlighter
cuz I'm an ice cold bitch oh yeah can't
stop won't stop going all day all night
yeah bitches don't know what hit him in
the face
spoiler alert it was my clothes oh ah my
highlights are brighter than Trump
America's future I don't even really
know what this brush is for totally the
wrong brush oh should I make my neck low
it's not even make sense is this what
you want
alright now that I'm going like a boss
let's do the final part of this makeup
look which is putting this on my
lips with the liquid oh I forgot to
do the lower lash mascara oh you just
blend it in and it makes it look like
you put like black eyeliner there yeah
sure now let's make some liquid metal
 oh wow
oh it's kind of cool oh why does it
sting
it kind of stings that's not good right
I'm gonna wipe the gold off and we're
gonna do this again uh yeah now the
telephone companies know where all their
stolen copper wires when was I supposed
to put on lip liner with this because I
don't have one quite this color oh yeah
over draw the lips
yeah that's Kylie Jenner seeing these
yet she hasn't you can that she's coming
out with these lip kits next it's
actually dries kind of nice knit to go
all over my teeth just Lilla I consider
that an improvement from last time it
looks like I ate a radioactive mermaid
it feels like nothing anymore in it it's
not even sticky Wow am I giving a
meaningful review it all right now
look
have some mental more fun by adding some
gold to the middle like this
cool bro cool and now it's time to
pretend that I didn't just wake up in my
house and do a tutorial for no reason
and that I'm gonna take it off in 20
minutes but that I was actually going
out and that's why I got really glam so
we're just gonna put my hair down for
that do
oh come on hair you're so naughty oh I
just realized my earrings don't match at
all let's fix that there we go so I
would say this look is great for a first
date and everyone will know if you had
your first kiss also you don't even need
to try to be the trophy wife you already
are because your lips are gold
my lips look like I drank from the
sunshine hey maybe that's a good thing
and it'll make all the other beauty
gurus smile more in their pictures is
that it being all like I had tea for
breakfast nothing else just tea don't
eat much
can't you tell morphe using the code
bitch yay yay now not that I'm that
qualified in makeup or have reviewed
many makeup products at all actually
this seems like it's probably one of the
most metallicky lip things in the entire
world that I have seen that you can
paint on your face is that true I don't
know comment below you tell me you know
what it's still not hollow and I would
love to be able to put the holographic
equivalent of this on my lips like make
it this shiny and metal but add
holographic pigments you know what I'm
saying like rainbows rainbows that dance
yeah my career as a beauty blogger will
only take off when that happens anyways
umm I'm probably never gonna wear these
again because I don't wear makeup unless
I'm making videos like this which kind
of sucks because these were inexpensive
I think I got my money's worth I wonder
what it would look like if I put this
 on my nails this on my nails is a
brilliant idea I think I'm gonna go make
that video right now if you want to be
notified when it's up you better
subscribe to my channel you know what
I'm saying
don't forget to like up this vid
if you want simply face a lot to go back
for another jaw-dropping look thanks so
much for watching and I'll see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
