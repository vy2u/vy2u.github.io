news of mind outbreak which happens to
be seven months after we held a funeral
for the last family tragedy may you rest
in pieces I know you're still in shock
thinking how could this happen and what
the fuck are you going to do now
Christine you're a goddamn nail Channel
and I second those emotions girl I feel
you thank you to everyone for bearing
with my drama because I'm ready to talk
now first let's get into what the hell
happened but everything was happy and
I'll la-dee-da with my unicorn rainbow
nails and then I decided it would be fun
to film a makeup tutorial because I have
a face so why not so in order to do that
I got to move my desk in my nail cage
back for the right camera angle so
stupid fucking me decided to be a hero
instead of asking me been to healthy and
move the goddamn desk and then tragedy I
had reached around the corner of the
desk and in trying to lift its weight I
press too hard with my fingers match my
nail right in the goddamn center of it
mother filmed out right
after I realized that what had just
happened was not a nightmare reality
began to set in and I fix it who I put
on a fake me who I am PK is my youtube
career oh it was time to take off the
nail polish and his chest again and holy
shit damn it stung like a bitch for
whatever reason this was one of the few
times that I wasn't wearing a seal off
base coat so unfortunately I had to use
nail polish remover to get the nail
polish off I spent probably more than
half an hour carefully taking off his
nail polish because every time you rub
back and forth it hurts like a bitch do
you see how far down that crack goes
yeah I'm surprised I wasn't bleeding
ironically I couldn't get some of the
hollow glitters out of the cracks oh
they're still there I am one with the
hollow hollow shall be in my bloodstream
forever but silver lining or shall I say
hollow line my nail did not split
completely across thank the hollow gods
so I decided that I can probably save it
for now at least until grows out did you
imagine ripping off your nail at that
point I'm gonna cut the pain the pain
the emotional pain well now it's time to
figure out what the hell to do from here
kind of a liability walking around with
long ass nails like this that are split
at the middle and could rip off at any
second so I decided well you're gonna
have to go now you're gonna have to cook
I initially tried to start chopping it
down with some nail clippers but where
did vice don't do that then I decided
well maybe I'll file my way to recovery
but oh no even that was painful because
the nail filed pushing the broken part
of my nail back and forth which was then
as a result of digging into my skin so
it was time to get a little handy and
build myself a little splint so that I
could found my nails without as much
paint you know what I'm saying the
mary-jane hey maybe I should use some of
that to cope with the pain huh
I mean what by wrapping my nail and a
DIY splint of cotton and electrical tape
I was able to safely file the tip of my
nail down without a completely murdering
my nail bed now clearly I did not file
it down all the way to the break because
that is just too far into my nail bed
and it would be too painful to exist so
now I'm going to try and be a hero and
save what I have left of my nail because
I believe in the power of hollow the
only problem is the breaks are on both
sides so the nail is pretty large I'm
going to do one side at a time let's
start with the side that's not so bad
just applying some nail glue and then
holding it into place with the q-tips
oops
glue sticks to a q-tip and then the idea
is that you dip the wet glue into this
powdery shit which kind of bonds to it
sort of like a tea bag it's similar to
the tea bag six you may have heard of
for broken nails but just not a tea bag
because I use my tea bags to drink my
tea if you'll follow my snapchat you
know that tea time is all the time
powdery shit and the nail repair kit
kind of bonds to the glue it turns into
a solid if you can file down great
explanation Kristine tell us again now
let's do this side and holy
that hurts so bad I almost called the
wambulance there's literally glue under
the skin of my nail at this point but
dive into that white powder and you'll
feel immediately better Christine
Wireless I'm on a dog references anyhow
videos there should be no drugs on the
internet dust off the blue because the
party is over sorry I couldn't help
myself well now there's nail glue in the
cracks of my nail the powder combined
with the nail glue is supposed to
basically cement the shit together and
now we buff it down just a little
because the glue shit isn't even at all
it's like a bunch of shit
decided to do two rounds of said nail
glue and cocaine just to make sure that
everything will hold itself together
buff it down a little bit now I can
actually file my nail without pain
because the sides are stuck together now
so that's a good sign and then it was
time to file down all of the traitors
siblings I'm sorry guys you had to go
short to family sticks together
know what I'm saying definitely looks a
lot better and it feels a lot better so
now my plan is to cover that shit up
with gel and basically let it grow up
I'm applying some gel base coat that
I've never used before because I'm so
used to peel off base coat let's see
real big fat shit for a minute and
strangely it is sticky
why are you sticky I do not have enough
experience with gel polish to understand
I don't got time for this
so I took a little bit of acetone and
tried to rub it off and use the gel taco
instead because it's probably the only
professional nail tech product type
product I know how to use it's not
really supposed to be used as a base
coat but it solidifies and does the job
and all the nail techs please shut up I
know I'm not doing this right let me
live now I'm doing probably a nail techs
worst nightmare and adding regular not
gel nail polish over the gel chaka
because it's black hollow
which is what my soul and my emotions
look like right now during this tragic
time in my life to top it all off I'm
going to add another gel taco so it's
like a sandwich mm-hm see maybe I did
that on purpose it's a gel taco sandwich
you look at taco sandwich make that shit
for a minute and there we have it the
short nails simply my illogical broken
what never defeated
you can definitely tell that the middle
finger is worked not gonna lie and I
think it's probably best if I just let
this tragic break grow itself out
naturally I don't want to keep removing
and adding nail polish to mess with the
brake further you know what I'm saying
I'll let that shit heal some time but at
least they're hollow so I can guide
myself through the darker days of life
feel better
middle nail feel better oh but wait a
second what's that on my other hand to
better shape than my other other hand
it's a beautiful multi crown that shifts
from purplish to oranges to yellow is to
greenish and well look at that beauty
why don't I wear these more often all
right guys I want to thank everyone for
your support and your prayers in this
very difficult time in my life of course
I'm going to keep uploading YouTube
videos but at least for the next month
or so I'm going to have to scale back
just a bit on nail art because I don't
have a good clean canvas to work upon
anymore it's damaged it needs time to
heal to look forward to Mars keep it's
shady video I mean look forward to more
great I'm inspiring positive content as
long as I have managed to make someone
laugh then I am happy even if it's just
me laughing at myself with that said
thank you so much for watching guys and
I'll see you next time bye
