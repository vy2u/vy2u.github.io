well hallo everyone to make her seen
again look at this the space is so big
it's so wide that you can hear the echo
three times I can actually spin around
because now I have room to do so I
apologize for the echo we're gonna have
to figure that out maybe once I fill up
my shelves with my thousands of nail
polish they don't just you know absorb
the sound we got all my nail polish
right here waiting to be unpacked but
before we get into that I gotta tell you
about my shells we've hired a local
cabinet building company here in Ottawa
to help us design and build the shelves
also this isn't sponsored and we paid
for the shelves but actually come to
think of it it's kind of like you guys
helped to pay for the shells every time
you watch one of my videos and you get a
little add we get a little money and
then we take that money and we go spend
it on your clothes so we shall declare
that this video and these shelves were
sponsored by you guys Thank You Janice
Thank You Cara thank you Tom for
watching my video they may look just
like plain old black shelves but they're
actually quite expensive because a lot
of work goes into designing them to
custom fit the space and then build them
exactly how we wanted them if it were
that simple we would have just gone to
Ikea first we met with the shelf
designer that's we planned out the
shelves on their 3d rendering program it
looks like The Sims basically you'll
have lower storage all over here we'll
make these so that your couch is just
below it so it's the entire wall the
entire wall will be filled with nabla
Wow so this is real carpentry yep here
is your secret boyfriend oh my god
any one Directioners out there now I
knew I wanted a shelf big enough to
allow for expansion of my collection so
we decided to line this entire 11 foot
wide wall with shelves from left to
right and it goes all the way up to the
ceiling basically I wanted the
Jacqueline Hale of closets but for
nail-polish I chose a matte black finish
so it looked pretty much exactly the
same as my old shelves I don't like
change kind of prefer a black backdrop
because it helps make the hollow polish
and then we got some cabinets down at
the bottom that's where we're gonna put
the creme polishes I don't think the
designer thought that this shelf was a
good idea for resale considering how
it's pretty much permanently stuck to
the wall now but you know what it's not
a problem because I'm just never gonna
move again once the design was done the
shelves got sent for building slash
painting and then the install day was
finally here xyler was pretty excited by
the lasers and honestly Salvas I do you
see what they're doing they're using
lasers to see how straight the walls are
like how cool is that is the fuch matrix
electricians were also needed because we
had some electrical wiring done to power
a couple transformers that we hid in the
cabinets under the shelves to power some
LED lights that lined all 13 rows of
shelves
looks like Twizzlers don't misspell it
that's how I was gonna spell it but it's
like nail polish
yeah maybe lining it with lights made it
overly complicated and far more
expensive but when it comes to my nail
polish it deserves the best treatment
there is we're gonna power it up later
first the lower cabinets went up to act
as a support and apparently walls are
never straight so they had to do some
shimming on the back boards of the
cabinets and shelves which basically
means shoving behind them so that
they said flush to the wall
isn't it amazing I learned things about
construction and then they just lifted
up the shelves just like that easy right
against the wall they don't let you know
it fits okay
then tried to help them put up the
shelves but I was like then you need to
relax it's okay
so have you ever built or installed a
nail polish shelf before many many doors
and frames and no nail polish units the
first what's wrong with people the back
of your shirt says simply yeah like you
I also wonder if the shelf builders just
thought I was a crazy person there were
a couple finishing touches left like
adding some fillers to border the
shelves nicely the lower cabinet doors
went on and Zeiler was still supervising
men she was hiding she hates other
people she's kind of like me they also
made us a bunch of little shelf inserts
so we can have like a double layer in
each shelf and there you have it - my
friends my new nail polish shells
then it was time to move we packed up
all my nail polish in about seven hours
you can see that really exciting process
in last week's video I'm not breaking a
nail
movers probably also thought I was a
crazy person please be careful if anyone
breaks any of my nail polishes I will
break them we can't forget this set of
nails and then we said goodbye to our
old home I'll miss you nail polish room
we're okay in there
the desk has arrived we're keeping it
well would you look at this I got my own
red carpet for my own sweat pants
fashion show yep it's not that much
judging me I think this is funny my role
John you been that's one of the old
shelves
there's the news yeah holy it and
now here we are now I gotta unpack
hopefully nothing broke please leave a
prayer down in the comments it will
change the outcome
you ready this is a dangerous weapon I
should not be trusted with that where is
that ban by you okay
that's right see how to train your
drink's legs I'm really looking forward
to it like I'm not kidding this is
really exciting look back to that I know
what you're thinking you're probably
like Christine you can't even reach the
top shop well Carol let me show you with
this simple three-step stepladder I can
reach all the way to the top this is a
good opportunity to actually
how many bottles of nail polish I have
guess we'll find out soon exactly how
bad this problem has got by color or by
brand that is the question
I'm gonna do the same thing I had at the
old place and organized by brand because
I find if you do it by color that's
really hard because there's all
different types of colors of HA but also
because I personally find it just looks
missing
not one break yet take that everyone who
said my packing strategy was extra I saw
some comments saying why don't you
destroy your nail polish in the plastic
men it'll be a lot faster would you
throw your children in a plastic bin you
bad mother it's like a surprise what
brand I'm gonna find what brands in this
burrito
oh it's soya oldest oil girl how are you
doing its bit so that where do we put
yours ayah you see you can't go in the
middle because that's prime real estate
we're gonna have to put you over to the
side hello it over here in right field
unwrapping nail polish all over again
where do I put you what do I do with you
exactly like what my parents used to say
to me when I was growing up should we
put you ESI's like that girl in high
school
see I got quite the personal history
with polishes I have so much nail polish
that nail salons are jealous simply no
logical nail salon danger oh my god it's
a Chanel polish
this my food you bring me food so I can
survive on dougie up good boy
have you been counting as you go so
that's something you might have to do in
both lose a healthy food Ben my rabbit
okay what's next
I'm getting too old for this
oh my god I have so many shells to feel
great
anyone remember when kind of Jenner came
out with the sinful colors nail polish
do you think her nail tech uses this
when she gets her acrylic nails I'm not
sure about that
oh my god the unicorn he made it you
know how rare this is for rare that no
one cares anymore
oh you doing great just a kick Aybar
you're like my hair started off looking
like a nice braid and now it's this is a
hollow beg that one of you guys sent me
to my p.o box custom made for men gee
now we got a chest today oh my god she's
going in she's inspecting to make sure
its real hollow we got to give her time
in space you know she's gotta touch
everything with her face for at least
three hours before she fixes buttons and
stuff hello that strategy put all the
brand's in my pocket and we take them
out I need it yeah there's like six
other from that brand I just don't know
which box it's into it's really annoying
that I can't like find all six pieces of
that
okay the color gloves and there's a
domino effect and all the job needs such
a first world problem
I can't organize like three thousand
bottles you don't like how I did it no
she's right he's gonna have to redo it
oh I think I need to update my will for
my new nail polish oh they're not here
don't worry I'll leave them to you have
you found any broken ones from the move
no expert packing

say to the class

great time cheers to that

hollows last night I'm allergic to the
ocean it's impossible dead by now if
there are people who are actually
allergic to nail polish my heart goes

space here haha Taylor Swift don't come
for me in the past people of asking what
happens when there's an earthquake isn't
this a dumb idea
there was like never earthquakes where I
live in Canada please don't jinx me so
one thing I like a lot about them is
that this room despite being like fully
brand new and professional kind of looks
really similar to my old nail polish
room yeah actually I'm looking at it on
camera ice cream right now it's kind of
shocking how much it looks the same you
know when they say they're like
top-shelf liquor or Tata shelf something
as if it's like really good yeah you got
some top-shelf polish up there
well no cuz I can't reach so I actually
put the ones I don't care about that
it's strange to see the gaps in the
shelves yeah we're gonna have to do
something about that oh yeah I'm gonna
need to buy I think it's starting to
feel like home except we're missing one
thing yeah what's that oh I'll put you
in charge of this one actually I don't
know you sure you wanna hire a
professional is stud there actually

batteries out to put it in the kids

Oh baby yeah let's guess how many
polishes I have and then we're gonna
count after the fact is he was close
yeah been counting no this is like
guessing the number of jellybeans in a
jar sort of thing yeah except more
exciting if I guess closer we get to go
on vacation I got so much to organize I
guess closer I get to embarrass you in
another video it's like it's gonna
happen anyway okay on the shells I think
you have 1,650 so don't do the prices
right thing and just guess one more than
that well you went first so I would you
say I said 1650 1651 before we reveal
the answer pause the video guess in your
head let's see how well you do
