video and actually get a nail our video
and that's the one time my intro card is
relevant okay well hello everyone it's
me Christine again and today we're gonna
play with some funky nail polishes that
make a bunch of bubbles or spots when
you apply them over another color this
particular line is by sinful colors the
hypnotic transforming topcoat collection
which came out in August of 2017 why did
it take me so long to play with these it
doesn't matter just look how cute my cat
is so sinful colors release five shades
of these magical transforming top coats
or tacos as we say here and they claim
it gives the nail an acid-washed melted
or distressed look in a single brush
stroke lots of you guys have asked me to
review these and buy lots of you guys I
mean only three of you guys whose
comments I could find does that you
won't even want this let's give it a try
I'm applying regular white polish and
while it's still wet I'm gonna lightly
paint over it with one of the
transforming tacos wow that is actually
some cool scientific shit right there
oh my god it's mitosis the cells are
dividing now I'll show you all the ways
this stuff doesn't work because it's
really easy to follow you can't apply it
by itself over nothing it just applies
like a shitty uneven polish if you do
that you also can't apply it after your
base color is dry because the science of
that will not yield the magic little
bubbles just ugliness a really thick
coat of this stuff also doesn't work
because it's too heavy and the bubbling
doesn't come through and painting it on
like you would a normal second coat of
polish where you repeatedly stroke the
nail for even application won't work
either because the transforming color
will just blend in with the base color
and now we look in like milk and so
apply any base color you want abnormal
polish and while it's still wet take the
brush of the transforming taco and wipe
off half the polish so there's just a
small amount left on the brush then
apply it with a light touch on the wet
nail and don't do too many strokes now
that is cool is right Benjy mange mange
let's try it on my nails yellow regular
polish as the base and here's me
applying it incorrectly as if it were a
second coat of regular nail polish it
mostly just blends and doesn't really
look like the desired effect of bubbles
so don't do that
and this time I only stroked my nail a
couple of times with the taco and didn't
put too much pressure on the brush okay
you got a go gentle and very lightly but
I did find it tricky to get an even
distribution of the spotting effect
because it's really hard to get the
edges and near the cuticle area of your
nail when you're limited to minimal
brushstrokes and I guess sinful colors
agrees it's tricky because in one of
their ads they literally do supply the
nail polish on a flat surface instead of
nails more on that technique later okay
kids now let's try it over black ignore
the little bits of white that's from
double dipping oops it looks cool but
the contrast isn't as a parent over
black as it is over white how about some
blobby cure style nailart wow look at
that 2015 simply analogical bitch coming
through there's definitely a lot of cool
possibilities here and I find this
pretty beginner level and easy for most
people to accomplish but I know what
every hollow sexual is wondering right
now since the top coats don't come in
hollow can you use them over hollow
let's chat
and weird it's like not reacting well in
the holographic solution the fuck sinful
why you so sinful I'm gonna hold my
judgment now and we're gonna try the
whole shade range overall I'm kind of
underwhelmed by this boring color
palette I wish there were seven Aeon
colors or something more fun because
although these colors are fine and most
of them look pretty good over white you
can't really see them that well over
black if these came in neon colors it
might look better over black but this is
all we got you can put the transforming
top coats over neon colors of course but
I still find the stoppers themselves
kind of lacking in opacity and
saturation they are a little dull and
thin and formula oh wait there's more
sinful colors was not the first to come
up with this effect surprise surprise
some of the hardcore nail fanatics out
there might remember that in the summer
of 2016 when Russian nail polish company
dance legend came out with pretty well
the same thing that sinful colors came
out with a year later these dance legend
ones are hard to come by in North
America at least I had to order them
from a supplier in Europe and get them
like two months later I think these ones
actually perform a bit better in terms
of bubbling than the sinful color ones
sad and they also come in black and
white which i think is almost a must to
have those as staple shades instead of
being limited to some odd mostly d
saturated colors and I found that the
dance legend colors looked a little bit
brighter over black but wait there's
even more does anyone remember OPI black
spotted I believe it was one of if not
the first nail polish in 2012 to give
off the Spotted effect the only
difference was you were supposed to
apply it over dry nail polish so clearly
there's some differences in formula
there I did not own this polish before
but I bought it specifically for this
video so I can test it and because it's
so old and rare now you can only find it
on eBay and I think maybe I might have
got a fake because I could not get it to
look anything like the pictures anyway
it's just for your own historical
reference OPI did come out with a
spotted like topcoat effect polish back
in 2012 back to the hollow because I
have not given up no let's see
hmm it kind of worked but also kind of
met wow that did not work at all yeah
kinda looks dirty or milky yeah
maybe a bad color choice but the bubbles
are too hidden this one looks like a
murder scene and just know it is with
great sadness my friends that I have
come to the unfortunate conclusion that
these transforming tacos just do not get
along with holo my condolences everyone
please leave a like and say a holler
prayer and now let's play on a mat
because like sinful colors own
commercial for this stuff I found it a
lot easier to manipulate the placement
of the bubbles and get a nice wide even
spread without the issue of working
around curved nails or having cuticles
and you know edges actually around your
nail this is what's called making nailed
Eagles yes I say dqo strangely did you
miss it tickle tickle tickle tickle okay
okay anyways by applying the polish on a
silicone mat you have the freedom to
make and manipulate whatever designs you
want however many times you want which
is great if you a fuck I also tried the
smooshing effect by squishing the wet
polish with a ziploc bag or a plastic
wrap to see what would happen
wow that's how you make art people this
is how you just smush paint around and
then I squish wet polish with a clear
jelly Stamper because Instagram now
artists told me - Wow looks like a
jellyfish you can also make your decals
on a yogurt lid or a small plastic
surface and then tip it over to create
falling patterns in the paint this is
called the drip marble technique which I
did almost exactly a year ago in this
video on this channel believe it or not
you can create some really beautiful
shit this way just by using gravity I
mean look at that art okay then the idea
is that you make a bunch of these decals
and you can pick the ones that turned
out the best you let them dry on the mat
or the yogurt lids before you peel them
off I've
recommend giving them about four hours
for drying time to make sure they're
fully dry but also still flexible if you
wait too long like overnight
the nail polish might be too hard and
will just crack like this so keep it to
a few hours max so the decals are still
nice and flexy flexi oh wait a second
what's that on my other hand
yes I've switched my other hand nail
polish in the same video but who cares
look at this beautiful Brown linear
hollow polish oh yeah it'll be a sexy
chocolate Hollow baby right now I'm
feeling more than just in the nail
polish experiments mode but I'm feeling
in the nail art mood rare I know
so roast me this shit is so fun and easy
to make and you know what every decal is
a new experience and four hours later
now we gonna peel it off cuz it's time
to do our nails before that I just want
to add a quick note about working on a
Mac which I find so easy and many people
ask how to clean it you can wipe it down
with acetone no problem but I have a
special trick just let all the polish
dry and then rub a lint roller over it
it's like taking cat hair off of your
sweatpants perfect and now what do you
say it's time for some people
first we apply a peel-off base coat
because bitch what else
one coat of base color nail polish I'm
going with the turquoise look and while
it's still wet you're gonna stick the
decal right on the nail you can press
down with your fingers or with a tool as
long as it's soft and here's where you
can see why it's so much easier to work
with decals that didn't overly dry and
we're still flexible it really helps to
be able to flex the decal around any
natural curves in your nail and you know
what bitch my nails got curves they've
got some serious see curves okay they
curvy ladies then you're gonna take some
tiny Russian scissors roebuck and cut
off the excess decal from around the
nail tippity-top and it don't stop for
the final touches you can prior trim
some scraggly pieces off with a metal
cuticle tool and then take a cleanup
brush dipped in acetone and line it
around the edge of your nail to help
melt and seal the decal right onto your
nail as if it was a second skin this is
especially important for the tip of the
nail so you can have a nicely wrapped
tip which is very important okay by
melting the polish to become one with
the under edge of the nail as if you
applied the polish on the usual way no
one will ever know it was a decal
because no one says decal like that and
while stunning who is she
no but really who is she this is not
simply an illogical or the Christine we
know mm yeah that turquoise stone with
some rose gold Sparkle oh so classy what
happened to know what would make these
nails look even better though adding a
hollow taco oh my god okay nothing has
changed at all and then we gotta top it
all off with a nice thick coat of glassy
taco there now it's perfect just a
subtle sprinkling of scattered hollow
taco in the end I didn't even use any of
the sinful color magic transforming top
coat shades I just found the black and
white ones from dance legend to work
really well and they were just generally
more versatile but I'm curious have any
of you guys use these special magic
transforming spotted top coats let me
know in the comments below if you have
or if you want to try them or if you're
just in shock that I just did nail art
this is not a prank bro well alright
everybody thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
