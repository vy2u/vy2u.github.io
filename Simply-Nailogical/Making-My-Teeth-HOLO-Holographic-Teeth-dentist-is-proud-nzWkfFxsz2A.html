favorite thing I've ever put in my mouth
it's not weird well hello everyone me
Christine again did you hear I was
nominated for a beautiful person award
can't say I'm surprised because I've
come up with some really original
signature look tada
beauty girls I said I was coming for
your job it wasn't lying
alright so so it's no surprise that I
like ha-lo I've made a lot of things
hollow in my life my tears my YouTube
play button a goddamn pumpkin Hollow
seeing glasses
it's hollow bro DIY slime still hate
myself for that one I wore head to toe
Hollow for a day on Sophia's Channel I
was coated in a hundred layers of hollow
glitter nail polish on thread bangers
channel and configured spinners but
there is still one thing that I would
like to make hollow they you probably
wouldn't have guessed if it weren't for
the title or thumbnail of this video my
teeth a few months ago I came across a
YouTube video that showed you how to do
DIY holographic teeth I don't know what
the rest of the title says but the first
time I watched it I was very confused
because it's not in English it's in
Russians probably one of those talented
Russian male artists might have to
kidnap her video is by good Anna let's
try some Auto translated captions
resource also would you pinnacle for us
you just got the scooter kidney I don't
have one of those because I am unsure
that it is harmful to health okay so I
think she's at the dentist directly to
your friend I don't have any of those
what is M this is so sad I was fine so I
think she's putting on a glossy jail
taco now yes
shine bright like a bacon sham right
component plan okay so because it still
wasn't clear to me what exactly she did
I emailed one of my russian intelligence
contacts special senders she's a famous
nail artist in water marbling which
please keep my Russian contact on the DL
okay
I wouldn't want Trump to find out about
it and then like tweet it or some shit
so I asked that what the fuck this woman
was doing and she replied I will help
you with pleasure
so it's vet - speaks Russian but her
first language is not English so it's
still not a 100% translation but I
appreciate her trying to help me out
first she went to the doctor and he made
a cast of her teeth check then she was
helped to fill the gypsum to this form
oh shit cuz a gypsum fertilizer okay I
don't think that's correct
gypsum cast was covered with wax so I
got a shitload of dental wax that we're
gonna melt because you can put this in
your mouth gel base white gel top
without sticky layer holographic powder
then top coat I think I got this BAM
thanks feta for helping a girl out and
thanks good Ana for inspiring me I'm
gonna make a bad simply version also if
any of you happen to speak Russian
please go watch good Ana's original
video I'll leave the link down below and
tell me what she actually did because it
may not be what I end up doing I just
want to have the most beautiful smile
it's what I'm doing first is painting a
very thin layer of the melted dental wax
directly on the mold of the teeth
because this is what's gonna make the
gel pop off the teeth when I'm done
hopefully now I would have tried to use
it peel off base code but I don't think
you're supposed to put that in your
mouth so we're gonna use dental wax
instead I think it's fully coated
although it's hard to tell because the
wax is white now in the Russian tooth
artist video she applied what I think
was a white gel polish but I don't have
that but I do have a black gel polish I
mean my experience the whole powder
shows it best over a black base anyways
so we're gonna try that okay put it on a
little you're gonna live my suspicion
and my hope is that once this is all
cured with the gel UV lamp then it
should just pop right off of the wax by
the way this isn't really meant to be
like a tutorial for you to recreate at
oh please no one put gel polish in your
mouth also I don't even know if this is
gonna work yet so it's not such a
helpful tutorial anyways and now we're
gonna bake it for a minute I'm carrying
it from a life of boring beige smells
weird so if you haven't used a gel
polish before basically it dries
instantly because of this magical little
purple light gel
easy that's like the worst sound effect
ever and now we're gonna add a glassy
gel tack oh that's right you're so
hungry
you heard taco didn't you and this parts
a little tricky because you got to cover
all of the black but it's hard to tell
where are you already covered and where
you didn't because the gel taco is clear
let's get baked again I got some challah
powder mixes right here so just as we do
with the hollow powder on the nails we
got to find an eyeshadow applicator oh
here's one can I just have them laying
around everywhere because they are my
favorite beautiful person utensil then
you just gonna dip it in your hollow and
rub it on your teeth
yo fuck the tooth fairy bringing you
money and shit under your pillow there's
a couple tiny places where I'm
the Del Taco the holo isn't sticking to
the teeth whoops but that's fine it'll
just look like you know you got a little
chip in your tooth I have one of those
already see I'm trying to dust off all
the excess powder but I don't get loose
hollow powder in my actual mouth because
I'll tell you pretty you might be poison
I hate wasting this stuff hey anyone
want to do some lines and now we add
another glassy gel taco
so I apologized that the hollow looks
like shit under this lighting because I
have this ring light and soft foxes and
shit that's what happens when you
beautiful person in training I have to
have the right lighting to completely
over expose my face
imagine this doesn't pop off
I don't think this wants to come off
shit what what am I supposed to do now
now the part where the hollow teeth were
actually taken off of the mold isn't in
good Anna's video so I'm not really sure
if she just popped it off her it's kind
of really mushy it doesn't want to pop
off and like one solid piece like my
nail police where's the peel porn
but I got a plan me what's that sound is
it the sound of I should have done this
first because it's the way easier so
this is what the dentist made using this
mold it fits perfectly to my teeth well
not really it's a little big yes I
realized by doing this I'm gonna ruin it
but I don't really give a shit for a
minute I had to go to plan B to work not
anymore
walking into your dentist's office like
bitch I fixed up your equipment we gonna
get crunk tonight bitch sticking it
right in the molar like a cavity I wish
all my cavities were Hollow Ben how do
you like your soft supple cuticles what
did you guys see in my how to grow your
nails video and they been put on my
crack oil for a month I'm just gonna
cure it again one more time for extra
protection
later oh my god
I did it I put it in my mouth so um if I
don't upload this video then you'll know
this was poison and I died
hey I think my dentist would be really
proud time flight like a diamond don't
forget to brush your hallo kids this
feels good - the fact that I can't speak
properly you're kind of falling out
that's fine it's just like my grandma
it's been 84 years and I'm still in love
with Halle why I have bluetooth when you
can have hello - ha ha ha you're so
gummy you know where Hollow looks even
better in the sunshine
okay well this was fun this is the kind
of quality content you subscribe for

and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
