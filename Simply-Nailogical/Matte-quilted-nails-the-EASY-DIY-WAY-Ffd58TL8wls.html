and today I've got some matte quilted
nails for you because I don't know why
oh well wait a second
some of you did ask to see more matte
nails on this channel but no one asked
to see quilted nails hello dad just say
Lowell really first I start off like I
always do and apply a peel-off base coat
because I don't know if my first attempt
is going to work now what boring colors
can I use to paint on my nails I don't
really have a plan yet so I'm just
painting my nails pink like every girl
does when she doesn't have a planet like
that pink just dried to a raspberry
color weird I add another coat because
I'm not quite sure if I'm colorblind my
camera's crazy or I'm just crazy and now
it's time for simply peel the condom of
nail art I need her to protect my skin
from c9 new nail polish because I've
decided that I'm gonna do a gradient I
know don't question me also very
important news you need to know that on
January 12th simply peel along with a
whole bunch of other nail care products
will be on sale they only do this twice
a year I put the link below so don't
forget to mark your calendars January
12th nail stuff sale your life is
complete your walk look at how such
boring colors can look so juicy on a
makeup sponge by the way did I mention
that I got a new macro lens for
Christmas I know I'm wasting its magic
on a creme
but don't worry it'll see hollow soon by
the way I always put the links to my
camera equipment down in the video
description box below so this is
basically just a two color gradient
obviously you don't need to explain this
Christine but sometimes I feel like I do
because I don't know the intellectual
capacity of some people who watch these
videos it's dad look at my dad bitch
down come my dad bitch daga my dad bitch
dad my dad bitch I like to do a couple
coats and a bunch of thin layers because
it makes the fade between the two colors
real laughs why do I occasionally do a
southern American accent I don't know
it's just fun okay let me talk how I
want to talk y'all and then you gonna
peel off simply peel like no big deal
okay I'll shut up now and then I moved
my hand away for whatever reason
probably to check Instagram and thank
God I must have foreshadowed this moment
and therefore I think myself for putting
on a meal off Facebook the most
effective way to get it off though is to
add a quick tried topcoat first to this
disaster that's on my nail and let it
dry for like a couple minutes I think I
waited three or four minutes because I'm
really impatient and oh my god I have
found the magical wooden sticks
I must have previously been blind at
Walmart but now I no longer have to hack
up my nails with metal objects you can
watch my other video on what's the best
feel off face coat but I did put the
link to the one I'm using down in the
video description box and I also made a
second video on peel-off base coats
force Watchers and what I'm doing right
here would basically apply because I'm
taking this off like well before any
pictures were taken but you get the idea
and yes the nail polish is removing kind
of muscley but that's expected because I
didn't let the nail polish dry or the
topcoat really dry in a meaningful way
and then I redid all those deaths again
but it's okay it was meant to be because
we get to see me simply peel like no big
deal one more time
if you have a teeny tiny bit of nail
polish left over just use a cleanup
brush I use my nigga from twinkle tea
and you can use my code simply for 10%
off Christine you are especially
annoying today shimma shimma better
cheese - let me MA let me clear
something up before everyone goes boo
hollow cuz this is not hollow this is
called shimmer you see magical sparkling
rainbows above a notion that unicorns
are crossing by walking on water no then
it's not Hollow
I am also so unhelpful today and one of
these days I'll make a video on what
hollow is but just trust me when I tell
you this is not it but it's still cool
ok sometimes I like things that aren't
hollow I know it's rare but it happens
ok where the hell was I going with these
nails again oh yeah
quilt nails so I went to search those on
YouTube and I found this poor doo de
janeiro gender Sadie supa addict Revenue
Manager Pompidou Doh issue mm dr. Sheila
% EP value antipodal Luba just VB
languages mm pasta speci C obviously
French witchcraft that I can't do so
then I found this other video by Kelly
Marissa aka the nail polish challenge
your matte topcoat take my flosser and
I'm just gonna start creating diagonal
line and I was like that I can do so
you're gonna need some dental floss or
tool things these ones are
high-performance so they're gonna do
really well I had to go out and buy
these from my local drugstore because I
don't use these on a daily basis once
you have your floss or tool ready to go
you're gonna add that matte top coat on
your nail and watch the shimmer
transform matte top coat doesn't do
hollow justice anyways but it makes
shimmer look pretty cool so that's why I
chose shimmer maybe 30 seconds or so or
after the nail looks like it's
completely matte you can start taking
that flossing tool and put it to actual
use
just gonna do a kind of crosshatch
design because I'm so original right now
now when most people do the Flossie
quilted technique I don't think they
actually press the floss deep down
enough that you will see the natural
nail exposed but I did it by accident
and then I thought you know what it
actually looks pretty cool since the
purple part of the nail has pink under
it from when I did the gradient when you
press the flosser through you see the
pink pea coat and since it looks
fabulous to me let's just say I did that
accidentally on purpose since my nails
are super curved at the tips see this
video for more on my sexy c-curve it was
a little challenging to kind of wrap
this straightedge floss around the sides
and also near the cuticle yeah I like
stabbed myself more than once in my
finger let me just tell you that the
smallest nail of all the pinky was the
most challenging to do I put lots of
dents in my skin during this tutorial
but keep going because remember beauty
is pain and when you're done putting
dents everywhere you've got yourself a
royal cushion at least that's what it
looks like to me but because I'm a
hollow sexual and I can't help it I had
to add some hollow glitter somewhere so
I just took some quick dried topcoat and
applied it with a toothpick at the
intersections of the quilt and stuck on
some hollow glitters if you only live
one and bam I am Queen now where is my
palace someone please direct me to my
multi-million dollar palace I can not
find it and then I was bored so I just
added a glossy top coat out of sheer
curiosity to see what it would look like
it's pretty cool if you asked me that
the 3d effect remained after I glossed
it up but I'll leave that question up to
you guys what do you think looks better
matte or glossy and now that I've put
these flossing things to use my dentist
will be so proud the next time he asked
me if i flossed enough i'll just say
well my nail did and then he'll think
I'm insane and tell me to get out of his
chair and I'll be like gladly bye bitch
bye I hate you ok well thanks so much
for watching I'll see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
