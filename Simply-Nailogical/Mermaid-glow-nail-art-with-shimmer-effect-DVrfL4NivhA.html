again and today i'm a mermaid
let's go swimming oh yeah new porn yeah
before we begin i need to tell you
something very important make sure you
are subscribed to this YouTube channel
because that 1 million subscribers we
will unlock to give away full of hollow
polish if you're new here hallo is a
good thing and you want that so
subscribe so you can get it I'm starting
off with a peel off base coat because
I'm gonna give you what you want give
you some peel porn at the end of this
video yet next I'm going to add some
gorgeous holographic royal blue glitter
to my nails and it will be the base of
this mermaid design you know you're a
real hollow sexual when you recognize
this polish as one of the polishes from
my recent fun lacquer collection this
one's called how deep is your hollow
question mark and it along with its 5
hollow counterparts in the collection
sold out so fast you guys literally
broke the internet on release day
websites went down and people were
savage if some is in stock at the time I
posted this video I will put some links
down below in the video description box
and if not there are some still
available for pre-order which means you
can reserve your own there will be no
hollow sexuals fighting or rioting in
the streets do you guys hear me so as
you've been observing I've been sponging
on this holographic glitter with a
makeup sponge you can do it this way
with a small corner of the sponge and
just be really careful to only put it on
your nail or if you're really messy and
lazy you can put on some liquid latex Oh
whoopsie huh let's just rub that right
off oh wait a second what is that pink
it's time for what's on my other hand
this is not for my collection
I know I'm so bad at promoting things
but nevertheless it's a gorgeous bright
pink linear holographic polish they'll
link it down below normally I'm not a
huge fan of bright Barbie pink but you
know what if it's Hollow then
automatically love it now where were we
where were we oh yeah that's right we're
gonna sponge a crapload onto our nail
all at once ready yeah look at that so
much easier you can go back a couple
times and fill in any empty holes and
then when you're done all you got to do
is peel off simply peel like no big deal
mmm I love peeling things I'm gonna add
another coat just because and let's have
a dance party they're already here want
me to care okay now we got to use nail
vinyls because I'm going back to the
thing that I'm really good at these are
mermaid nail vinyls they are so easy to
use and I get them from my number-one
favorite nail vinyl shop I put the link
below as with everything else in this
video now here's a trick that I
personally haven't used yet you put the
nail vinyl down on a silicone nail art
mat you grab an array of pastel e
mermaidy colors that I would normally
never use because they are boring
you paint them over top of the nail
vinyl and now here I'm gonna make a
gradient without actually doing a
gradient I've seen people do this with
gel polish so I'm pretty sure I can just
try and figure it out with regular
polish so I'm kind of half-ass blending
them together sort of again does that
look like it's blended sure why not and
right away you got to peel up the nail
vinyl to reveal the mermaid fins not
fins what are those scales scales
yeah there's gills good job Christine
and then you're gonna do that a total of
five times or 10 times assuming you want
to paint all ten fingernails like a
normal person I've seen quite a few nail
artists use this nail vinyl on a nail
art mat technique but the last one I
remember seeing is from Sveta Sanders
she is my queen and inspires me to live
now we're gonna play with some mermaid
pigments ah-hoo hollow packaging now
I've seen this sparkly dust floating
around on nail tech pages and people who
use it on gel nails and such it should
have suggested to me right then and
there that I am not qualified to use
this did I listen No so before my
mermaid scales dried I just dusted the
cocaine for fairies I mean mermaid dust
I mean what is this stuff again all over
the scales with a fan brush to get the
glitter to stick to the polish
whew so pretty yes yes I love sparkles
iridescent everything
Carn so my thinking was that I only
wanted the mermaid scales to have the
mermaid just and let the middle of the
scales are in between the scales be
translucent so that's what I'm trying to
do here is kind of shove them out of the
spaces because there was supposedly
nothing to stick to except the mermaid
dust wanted to stick to silicone for
some reason next to turn this into a
real life decal that we can peel right
off the mat we got to apply some clear
polish not too long ago I was applying
quick dry top coat and then peeling it
off but I realize now that clear polish
is a lot better when you're making a
decal because it makes it more flexible
and less hard and rigid but that means
you got to be patient and let it dry for
a really long time so be patient by
young unicorns seal off your sticker
very carefully oh I'm just doing it
slowly because I like peeling add some
clear polish to your how deep is your
hollow blue hollow glitter nailed to
make it sticky and then you're gonna put
the mermaid into the ocean where she
belongs
sorry Ariel you are no longer allowed to
walk on the beach and pick up hot guys
okay
that's enough then you're gonna take a
cuticle pusher or something soft you
could also use your finger and you're
gonna press the mermaid decal down into
the ocean and by now everyone is
noticing my mistake with the mermaid
pigments clearly the mermaid dust stuff
did not cover the entire scale yeah I
know I think my mistake was letting the
polish dry on the mat a little too much
before I added the mermaid skin dust
stuff to remove the excess of the
mermaid tail you gotta do some surgery
I'm sorry
Ariel you were just not good enough for
Instagram take your little scalpel or
cuticle pusher thing and just gently cut
around the sides of your nail I know it
sounds really scary don't cut your
cuticles or your skin but just kind of
dig around in the clear decal thing will
gently remove itself use some tiny
Russian scissors if you need to trim off
some stubborn excess and then the next
step is really important to making it
look like you got your nails done
somewhere and you didn't just butcher
them yourself you're going to take a
cleanup brush and dip it in a hundred
percent acetone and then you're going to
melt the sides of the decal around your
nail this will give us that nice
seamless look everyone will ask you if
your nails are faked and where you got
them done when you're all done you can
add a nice thick coat of glossy top coat
so nice to watch it go on but also
because it helps protect everything and
seal it all in fam
Ariel got a facelift and she never
looked better so unfortunately due to my
super direct light setup I was unable to
capture the true beauty of the mermaid
pigments as they shift in different
lights I think the first time I saw this
kind of pigment stuff it was on
nikkietutorials nails I don't write a
makeup channel and I was like damn girl
I want your face glow and your nail glow
and naturally I just couldn't keep
things simple and I had to do some
overly complicated version of mermaid
nails if you follow me on snapchat you
would have seen me show off these
mermaid scales in real time in this snap
in this snap video if you're not
following me you should because I show
you things like this and more and more
and yes that's right it's simply an a
logic half without the elf because they
didn't give me enough room don't bring
it up it's still annoys me don't get me
started on Twitter okay
I could only have me illogical on that
don't even ask me why I promised you
some peel-off porn at the beginning of
this video now I'm gonna give you some
peel-off porn right now oh yeah little
