excuse me do you know what time recess
is okay thanks well hallo everyone it's
me christine again a mangie she is ready
for the holidays and yes I know my
makeup is crazy today but did I have fun
doing it yes anyways it's getting to
that time of the year where we reflect
on trends over the past 12 months in the
nail world if I had to name one thing
that kind of blew up this year and just
never stopped coming it would be nail
powders and in the YouTube world we've
had lots of different stupid trends but
one of my personal recent favorites
would have to be the mixing things
together trend as you may recall back in
April of this year I posted a video
where it makes 500 of my hollow nail
polishes together to see what color we
would get at the time I was inspired by
hello May fee makes 160 of her nail
polishes together and now here we are so
for everyone who doesn't watch me for
nails that's most of you
nail powders are often used to make the
hot new nail trend of having a shiny or
reflective smooth nail finished
basically the powder is buffed into the
nail with a sponge or a flat and soft
tool to give it that smooth shiny finish
this technique used to only really be
done by licensed professionals in a nail
salon but in the past year we've had a
bunch of different indie nail shops sell
these nail powders direct-to-consumer
and with that came a bunch of YouTube
tutorials to teach people how to do it
themselves and then all of a sudden you
got big box brands like essence and
Sally Hansen who caught on and started
selling nail powders in the drugstore
that shit hit the mass markets I tell
you the government is now taking the war
on nail powders very seriously you knew
they were going to be drug jokes in this
video shut up alright so what are we
waiting for
bring out the powders
manche I said break out the powders
myself and we've got here 15 different
iridescent nail powders nine silver
hollow nail powders six silver chrome
powders twenty multi chrome powders
eleven holo multi chrome powders and
eight coloured chrome / other types of
powders that did not fit into any one of
these preceding categories and that
brings us to a total of 69 nail powders
no I did not plan that that's just what
it is okay now for all those interested
in the research methodology let me just
briefly explain my selection criteria if
the powder had any form of chunks in it
or you could actually distinguish like
the different pieces inside such as
glitter or flakes it was excluded it was
hard to kind of draw a line between
what's a nail powder and what's a
glitter or a flake because sometimes the
pieces are so small that they could
almost be a powder and some of them even
perform like a nail powder but you have
to draw the line somewhere and as the
principal researcher on this project
actually the only researcher wait no I'm
not we have our research assistant Vinci
I just decided to keep the scope
somewhat narrow and only choose patterns
that were very finely milled or finely
cut you know like something you could
snort now looking at the selection of
powders we have here I would hypothesize
that we would end up with a very
colorful base because Multi chrome
powders are over represented in this
sample I would think that there's also
gonna be a hollow finish but given all
the multi crumbs I kind of have no idea
what actual color this will look like in
the yet and this is so much science I
think it's time to bring in Christine
the sign Queen Christine the science
queen Chris Chris Chris Chris Chris I
scare everyone away even my cat hey
these are gonna make lines and my makeup
so we're gonna have to put them on my
head so as in any professional
laboratory you're gonna need some
scientific mixing components as well as
very accurate measuring devices here we
have 1/8 of a teaspoon are you ready to
the end part the sea of powder sealed
for my protection sealed for my ok maybe
on second thought and I do need to wear
these everything is contaminated and
another bachelor or a master of science
only of the arts
so there's 1/8 of a teaspoon spoon is
honestly still a little big I feel like
I'd be wasting a lot of powder so I'm
gonna try and do half of an eighth of a
teaspoon which is also a sixteenth of a
teaspoon Wow look at that heck here we
go
I feel like I have on head a lot of
powders that I've never even used what
kind of a dare hold drug dealer would I
be oh yeah sure take iridescent powder
number three I mean I've never used it
myself but I hear it's a great time
alright now we moving on to hollow
powder this is the hard shit the good
stuff now I know it looks gray and kind
of boring but you gotta trust me once
you buff that shit into the nail it
comes alive you know sometimes people
say that going to school doesn't teach
you real life skills but excuse me do
you see all of the skills I am applying
right here right now now let's do the
silver chrome powders these were the oh
geez at least as far as I remember it
was the silver chrome powder to hit the
nail powder market first
okay we're done - silver crumbs and now
we move on now to the multi crown
these are definitely one of my favorite
types of powders basically a multi
chrome means that it's a chrome finish
so it's shiny or reflective but it ships
between multiple different colors and
not in the way that holographic things
reflect a rainbow spectrum but just
shifts in color depending on the angle
of the nail and the light I guess you
could say the same thing about Hollow
but it's very confusing it takes years
of research okay so this one would be an
orange to red multi chrome you can't
open in you know gee I need your supreme
being strengths oh yes thank you thank
you thank you you got some olive green
to gold multi chrome and all sorts of
beautiful beautiful colors so those of
you who are new here fun fact I'm a
crime statistics analyst to everyone who
starts laughing because they think
that's not possible you're an idiot on
YouTube and honestly yes it is really
cool
just like this
everybody hold on they must do a little
cleanup that's why I mentioned we gotta
stay sanitary in the lab next up we have
our Hollow multi chrome Packers these I
gotta say are a beautiful hybrid wait a
second
I wonder if these special hybrid powders
is really just a mixture of all the
extra supply that they couldn't sell it
playing dirty they playing dirty this
isn't really terrible but I just had a
thought
if you were to actually take all the
different types of drugs in the world
and mix them together what kind of trip
would that be I believe that respecting
your country or state's laws is
important but having a sense of humor is
not a criminal offense you know what
should be illegal though people without
a sense of humor how did we even like it
on this topic Oh too many powders for me
okay we're down to the last line oh shit
I think this one's kind of hollow oops
who coded this in the wrong category
mange mange mange
one of my best interpersonal skills is
being really easy to work with hi to my
boss and the final powder well would you
look at that on the top of the unmixed
sample we mostly see the colored powders
and the multi crumbs and hollows have
been kind of pushed around to the sides
of the glass and the iridescent powders
are lying at the bottom but what will
they look like all blended together
let's find out time to answer one of the
most important research questions we've
had on this channel you ready
kind of just looks looks like dirt whoa
oh no don't spill it shake shake shake
whoo I'm gonna get secondhand hollow
from this it looks like a very dark grey
maybe a tinge of brown base but I can
definitely see the iridescent and hollow
flakes scattered throughout when I add
my phone flash I don't know why I
hypothesize that it would be like bright
colors obviously when you mix a bunch of
colors they make black I should go back
to elementary school and now it's time
for the most important test what does
the mixture of 69 different nail powders
look like on my nails so I've already
prepped my nails with some plain black
nail polish and my preferred way to
apply nail powder is over top of a cured
gel topcoat so first we're just gonna
make sure there's no excess powder on
the black oh wait did you notice what's
on my other hand
it's a stunning magnetic multi chrome
polish you may have seen me experiment
with these polishes in a recent video
they are fucking magic and that is the
only conclusion and now we apply a nice
thick coat of glassy gel taco so then I
take my LED alien portal machine and I
faked that shit for a minute and now
immediately after we've cured the nail
and it's still fresh-baked we're gonna
take our eye shadow sponge applicator
and dip it in our custom powder and then
just buff it into the nail whoa that's
so cool that's so pretty
wait Ben are you there do you haven't
seen anything I've done right no cuz
you've been out all day yeah getting me
tea no I mixed 69 of my nail powders
together what color do you think they
made answer the question it's gonna be a
purple ho come look is it hollow yeah
it's got a little bit of hollow in it
obviously you dumped like way too much
of oh no no y-you scientific
measurements but it's kind of like like
a brown suede gunmetal like this would
be really nice in a men's dress shoe
okay anyways we're gonna do the rest of
our nests Thank You Ben
and we're gonna add a final coat of
glossy gel taco to seal the magical
mystery all into the end result of
mixing 69 of my different nail powders
yields a very unique custom finish its
base is like a slate gray color with an
undertone of brown elegance and it's
definitely got that chrome effect going
on it is very reflective understated but
beautiful I feel like I could wear this
to the office and not be questioned now
what am I gonna do with this custom mix
of powder sell it obviously
hey I got some simply special custom mix
not drugs
snail powder alright kids don't do drugs
hey boys how you doing don't be shy I
got one for everybody
fifty bucks a baggie but if you say my
code simply I give you 10% off you want
to nail powder how about you you look
like you could use a little nail rubbin
how about you gentlemen and I offer you
some nail powders no okay maybe next
