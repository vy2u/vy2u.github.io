internet for making me do this
hello everyone is me Christine again
recently I saw a video in which hello
maybe mixed all of her nail polishes
together to see what color they would
make and I thought to myself now that is
fucking science I must do this and who
better to stimulate you intellectually
them simply nerd logical Christine the
science Queen Christine the sides
please Chris Chris Chris bread bread
bread Chris Chris Chris Chris Chris P
class everybody calm down
that's enough you got the beakers and we
got the nail-polish specimens thousands
and thousands of them okay for the sake
of time and my sanity I'm going to
narrow the scope of this experiment of
it and mix all of my hollow nail
polishes
because Hollow remains one of the great
mysteries of science and I'm just trying
to advance science okay show me the
Hollow
so much for narrowing the scope am I
supposed to work in these conditions so
that any lab counterspace the rules are
polished must be hollow parts the
holocene is a bad idea I'm going to mix
two because one for me and one for you
you guys got any hypotheses though
what's the final end result color will
be aside from hollow write it down in
the comment so if you're wrong I'll
embarrass you in front of the whole
class I know what some of you might be
sick excuse me doctor simply nerd love
where'd the rest of it go well know you
might be thinking that this is a waste
of hollow but sometimes hollow must be
sacrificed in the name of time I don't
get a chance to walk on the moon in my
lifetimes and I'll know it's okay
because I did this getting - yeah sorry
it's in the name of science Ben I know
this seems like a lot of work but I'm
convinced I'm gonna find the hollow cure
there is no room for error no there's no
saving here now I'm bored
how about we look up some terrible
science jokes on the Internet did you
hear that oxygen went on a date with
potassium it went okay ha ha ha want to
hear a joke about sodium math I have to
make all these bad chemistry jokes
because all the good ones are are gone
I'm going to leave now
something really dark deep down inside
of me just makes me wanna pour up the
entire bottle now despite using a whole
bunch of different types of nail polish
I wouldn't call this a heterogeneous
solution not how my genius either it's
hollow genius and that's actually the
entendre through jokes in one eye laughs
what my own jokes because somebody has
to fun facts when I was in grade 12 I
first thought I would go to university
to be a pharmacist but then I saw all
the math involved and I was like see
y'all later back my falling asleep or am
I getting high really should have hired
a lab assistant and she - she where are
you
you know how they say that it's not fair
that youtubers get paid more than
doctors here's an example of why are you
watching this video when you should be
doing your homework the correct answer
is this is your homework and your last
one
pollo taco why do I do this domestic and
I present you all of my hollow nail
polishes in a cup unmixed
would you like a drink and now we can
cast your hypothesis because earlier in
the video I asked you to guess what
color the hollow polishes would turn
when you mix them all together let's
hope you remembered what she said is I
wasn't listening we have a scientific
thermometer for no particular reason
just that it looks cool with all this
geek hardware shut up okay here we go
amazing that this didn't turn like ugly
shit brown because Hollow is beautiful
the French what do you think what do you
think what are you seeing what do you
think
then come have a sip I made you
something special Ben this is your home
today and we got to take your
temperature oh my god let's take the
hollows temperature 23 degrees is that
normal are you sick it's beautiful but
it's missing one thing
more Hollow I thought we're here now
and now we got our preserve our
scientific specimen by pouring them into
nail polish but because I can't just
throw this shit out I don't have a
funnel so right for me oh yeah I'm high
bitch I should watch this
earth through a pilaf Mack existing
pouch being a little southern
motherfucker
and we saved them of course for science
Wow
second code hey I should do a Polish
mountain with this shade since I have so
much of it
well girls that's some pretty purple
don't forget to add a nice thick coat of
glossy taco and why am I talking like
this is a real tutorial what the salt do
I even do with all of these I should
smell them one-of-a-kind limited edition
only I wanted eight bottles made all the
fuckin hollow in one bottle that's
that's the name of it also known but
probably too long to print a label for
so I'm just gonna skip those so I sell
them when I could give them away oh shit
giveaway oh shit there's nine bottles
okay no this rest is eight why does can
i count myself drunk that's right
eight of you are going to win this
actually no I mean seven winners because
I'm gonna keep one all you got to do the
enter is ready to comment down below
make it funny
above that tell me a joke and if I like
it I'll message you on YouTube can you
even do that maybe you should leave your
Twitter handle in your comments so I can
DM you on Twitter I really thought this
out can you tell competitions gonna be
rough so you better get started thinking
of some clever startups to start ask
what man you drunk
kristinia drunk go home but I have home
but wait there's one more thing I wanted
to do think we got to make a porno with
how are you you like that if you're so
mad about me wasting polish then cry me
a river a Polish river
alright I'm better Hank so much for
watching and I'll be honest
ah ah goodbye you're going if I stand
fast enough all I see is hello my god so
dizzy the world
