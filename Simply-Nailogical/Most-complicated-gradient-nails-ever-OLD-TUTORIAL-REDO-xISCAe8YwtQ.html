everyone it's that time when Christine
which is me redoes a tutorial that I did
a year ago because the one I did a year
ago
made zero sense as you're looking at
these nails you're probably thinking to
yourself holy mother of how does one
even do that well I showed you a year
ago in a minute and four seconds and no
one understood imagine that so without
further ado here is jenna Marbles doing
her nails now I'm just kidding Jenna's
not here sadly she's not you I used a
whole bunch of colors from the rainbow
and I'm not gonna name them all cuz I
can't remember holy shit look how not
yellow my nails were a year ago clearly
I was a beginner back then and didn't do
my nails often enough now I'm a seasoned
nail artist and I do my nails so often
that there is yellow as the Sun okay so
that was me painting my nail white good
job and now we're gonna begin with the
first of approximately 54 million
gradients the first gradient is gonna go
in one corner of the nail that makes any
sense and although you can't actually
see what I did on my nail cuz I didn't
film it
I had actually put kids glue around my
nail to help protect from the gradient
if you ask me today I would tell you
that kids glue sucks and looks like
sperm
it also takes 12 minutes to dry so I
would use simply keel instead I've grown
up so much in only a year keep putting
on a bunch of light coats of the same
color gradient
I ended up doing four coats to build up
opacity but here's the trick kids all
about gradients don't load up your
sponge too much with nail polish and
effort to make it opaque on the nail
because that's not gonna work no no no I
don't think so
the secret is using a whole bunch of
thin light coats sponging on the nail
and then letting it dry like a minute in
between each coat I just switched to my
next nail in line with a totally
different color gradient so by the time
I got back to the middle nail it was
totally dry and there were no problems
add a quick dry aw what am i doing why
didn't I peel off the glue first oh this
is a terrible idea don't do this because
then the topcoat will just get stuck in
the glue and then it's gonna create a
disgusting mess like inside your
cuticles Oh Christine why Christine why
I guess I thought I was being smart by
putting on that glue barrier first and
using it for the entire manicure now I'm
using a bunch of striping tape to create
a pattern because I didn't have many
nail vinyls back then imagine that a
year ago now vinyls were something you
couldn't find everywhere on the Internet
now that the vinyls are all placed in
kind of this sunburst pattern thing I
don't really know what was going through
my head I often don't know the things
that come out of my head we're gonna do
the second gradient which is the same
coloring as the first gradient but just
the opposite colors flicked so flip the
colors and then sponge the colors on the
corner of the nail again after your
first gradient it will look like you
just ruined everything and there is no
discernible pattern it's okay don't
worry it's gonna work out you just gotta
use the thin gradient layer trick I
promise you dab dab dab one more time
and another time and now the fun part is
you get to reveal that reciprocal
gradient witchcraft hot so satisfying
killing these off and seeing that I
didn't fuck up
what is this ghost action do you see
that there's like nothing holding the
end of that certainty but what the fuck
is moving oh oh my god I don't know what
and that is so fucking weird this is the
second time it's happened to me in my
videos but this was filmed a year ago
I've been haunted retro actively I
didn't even know ghosts could do that
but I'm cool with it it's fun yeah so
you see that gunky nail polish it all up
in my cuticles that's because the glue
mixed with the topcoat when I was
putting it on in the wrong order did all
sorts of weird chemistry things so look
at me just removing nail polish with
acetone life used to suck didn't it
I had another quick dried top coat
because we're gonna do more gradients
yes and let it dry ladies and gentlemen
and you can watch this cat claw clip
that I've had for a year in my tutorials
and I don't feel like I want to change
it because it's kind of nice to pay
tribute to simply an illogical stare Cup
2014 so that white piece of tape is just
a French tip guide thing and then I use
some green painters tape because I like
to paint everything including my house
around that's my nail and why am i
off-camera I don't know okay there we
are we're back we're ready to go Hey
look it's different nail art when I had
time to paint nail art on both my hands
alright now that your nail is wrapped up
like a cocoon we can go start adding
gradient one two three that's right
Caribbean number three here we go now
this gradient color order should be the
same as the color order from gradient
number one because gonna be a scales
gradient this is like part two of the
reciprocal scaled gradient and I'm
making no sense and the point of this
tutorial was to make this tutorial make
sense a long time ago I made a post on
my blog simply analogical calm called
the gradient guide and there were some
pictures that help explain this or don't
help explain this one of the other but I
thought at the time of writing it that
have made a lot of sense so you should
go check it out if this isn't making any
sense in hopes that my blog post will
actually make sense to you hey maybe you
read better than you watch I mean I
don't know many people like that in fact
I would much rather YouTube how to do a
math equation can actually read a
textbook am i right am i right at right
all right now come out of your
Coon because you are ready to be a
butterfly young one more
not quite yet but soon that looks pretty
cool just does is doesn't it I snapped
this picture on my iPhone because I
thought it was really cool Batman but no
no gradient is ever enough for simply no
logical we go to outdo ourselves we're
so crazy
add some quick-dry blah blah left dry
and then add some more pieces of tape to
your nail this time the goal is to cover
up and protect the bottom corner
gradient because now we're going to do
another gradient on the opposite corner
side of the nail so you're going to add
more pieces of striping tape over top of
the little line so you have some before
and then kind of make those lines extend
beyond onto the new gradient so that the
lines look like they're continuing you
know what I mean you know you know
you're following okay let's go or you
could just leave it like this and call
it bondage nail art up to you now cover
up that corner side thing with some more
painters tape now we're going to sponge
on gradient number four finally this is
the last one and I just realized that I
found a new clip every single time that
I show you painting nail polish on the
sponge clearly I had no idea how to be
efficient a year ago either alright so
that was one sponge down coat now
number two that's not quite enough so
let's try number three god lilac why you
know a pagan up here's code number four
who do not satisfy me and code number
five let this be the last of them before
I pull my hair out all right looks good
now we get to peel everything off yes I
love feeling things I know you do too I
especially know that you love watching
me peel things which is even weirder so
fly out of that cocoon girl for the
second time I guess and then peel off
all those spaghetti strings off your
nail one by one you got to be careful
because you don't want to mess it up but
you also don't want to peel them off too
slow because then you're gonna let the
nail polish dry and then it's going to
turn all crusty the nail polish must
still be wet when you're peeling off
anything okay so we're just gonna go
back to the dark ages again and use some
acetone to clean up a lot of nail polish
around the size of our cuticles mm-hmm
oh the luxury of living in modern times
I tell you simply peel I owe you
everything girl why does it appear like
I don't even know how to put on top coat
okay how many times have I stroked my
nail what is this like 7 8 9 10 11 12
what the Christine why don't you know
how to do anything back then and we're
done finally I think that this actually
took me six hours back in the day of
doing this but it was totally worth it
because look how awesome that pattern is
right the ironic part is that I wasn't
going to redo it today because I knew
that would take me another six hours and
I would rather do a glitter placement
that takes me seven hours instead okay
and that's enough for your brain to
absorb in one YouTube sitting I'll see
you next time then bye
