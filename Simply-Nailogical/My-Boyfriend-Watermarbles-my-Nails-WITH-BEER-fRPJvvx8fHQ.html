some videos hope you've accepted the
challenge to water marble I don't know
why cuz that's like suicidal but it's
your life oh I feel pretty confident do
you think you're up to the challenge
pretty much just dip in your fingers and
paint right yeah that's pretty much it
it's really quite easy
it sounds pretty easy just search
Russian watermark blurs I want one in
English though so I understand what
they're doing maybe I should talk to
someone who does know how to water
marble what oh hi should I call you
Colette are my simple little pleasures
hi I had no idea he was gonna do this I
don't know what to say I just say hello
everyone it's like a collab by accident
except she's on a computer whenever you
talk it's like a water marble who came
up with water I think you did right
I didn't oh shit I was wrong on one room
temperature water easier similar
finishes together like use all cream
polishes or all hollow all light touch
barely touching the surface remember
that okay
I'm taking notes here no you're not
though alright well I'm feeling pretty
confident confident I've only tried it
like a bunch of times and made six
videos about failing but yes maybe some
people are just naturally gifted

video we're not supposed to show people
or failed oops I've been getting so many
comments each you got a watermark really
you need to teach Kristine how a
watermark if she can't cuz I complain
about it like every video we actually
just spoke to myself a little pleasure

be many like pro tipping this shit
stop saying pro tip no tip look I'm like
all my commenters Oh Ted Oh Ted Oh Ted
Oh Tim it's cool if want to mention
people from other channels and stuff on
your posts but it has nothing to do with
the conversation
yeah but everyone's also mad that people
mentioned me on their nail art post they
mention you a nail art right yes
so or something hollow so it kind of
makes sense yeah but Dan and Phil are
youtubers and I'm a youtuber
right that's enough it's not enough of a
connection sorry guys but Ben has
decided protip not okay
tagging me on a bunch of nail artists
post is okay I'm just kidding

angry and offended it's weird why so
sensitive

it go to your head keep your ego in
check I mean it's not perfect okay it's
not perfect I need more of a challenge I

going on Anna do some milk marble in
sparkling water marbling and some beer

Thursday take science very seriously so
we shall test all the solutions you want
me to pick some hollows to do this one
yes this is a challenge you must you
must follow through on the challenge you
know that show on MTV that's what this
is it's very American feeling patriotic
don't live in America yeah but you know
there's solidarity you know our
neighbors to the south unless Donald
Trump gets elected then we are not in
solidarity go to it I still believe in
Nate Silver who the statistician your
said he had no chance of winning no one
knows what you're talking either code oh
it's like champagne you got to pour it
really quick across all the glasses no
anyone ever teach out of poured beer no
I just took shots of hard liquor as a
child people already think we're so
Canadian and then you buy this it's
apple juice kids I feel like this is a
cooking channel now I should do a drunk
nail art tutorial okay we're starting
out with sparkling water I'm sorry we
didn't feel move what oh I'm not jumping
oh I just realized my nails aren't naked
oh well let's just water marble over
this hollow quicker quicker red red whoa
the bubbles are like making fun
whoa-ah do another silver yeah so I'm
getting so sorry I'm so excited all the
bubbles are you putting in
that looks so good though careful coach
a dip I don't have simply peel on ah
conclusion
sparkling water works now we know it
pretty cocky over there champ your
marble move head move ah this is how you
get your nails drunk what does the
carbonation do scientifically speaking
what is it doing what's happening looks
like the Pepsi logo oh I forgot to put
simply peeling again what are you doing
whoa ah stings like Dima that's very
eczema I'm outside like the way you love
to hear it being said for the third test
we're gonna try milk marbling that one
is not gonna turn out well I feel so bad
putting holo and milk the hollows like
you traitor you traitor
all right looks like milk marbling is
not a thing oh that does not look good
no I'm so sorry the hollows mad at me
the milk is now part of the design if I
ever try to water marble myself again
what are you doing don't you remember
how much of your best it made last
you're just in the code so why did you
want to do that can't water marble with
spray paint nail polish and you also
can't do much else with spray paint nail
polish except for vandalize property
when it gets dispersed in the water it
looks so pretty it's like a whole
magical world I wish our oceans would
look like that full of pollution
although is not pollution we have to
water marble with watermelon juice so we
think about it shouldn't taste so good I
look so cool ah ah ha ha I think this is
your best so far your best spread oh my
god don't mess it no don't don't overdo
it don't know it isn't going on my thumb
unfortunately it's gonna be but we've
seen that's the best one
like someone screenshot this so that
everyone can be like simply biologicals
boyfriend did oh the camera design until
gentle gentle watermelon sir forward now
that is American vote for Ben for
president
all right are we done I am honestly
impressed by your skills and I can't
believe that you pulled this off I mean
the milk one looks like shit but we all
knew that was gonna happen
yeah I mean it looks all right I'm so
hungry right now this has literally been
like five hours this mansion
there's no one here
come at me bro
yogurt marbling he's all sound weird
anything
