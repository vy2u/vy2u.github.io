like this naked family well hello
everyone it's me Christine again and
I've seen a lot of you guys ask me where
you yourselves could find a bed well
guess what I found another life boy this
is Ben's Brooke Ben's tired of my shit
so he sent his brother in his place to
put up with me so what did you do wrong
what did you deserve I've had my dad
paint my nails my sister paint my nails
then paint my nails and I thought today
was the day to have my boyfriend's
brother paint my nails excited mostly
scared honored I think you meant honored
yep
yeah terrifyingly now everyone knows
that Ben's thing is doing the taxes but
what you don't know is that his brothers
thing is math you literally have a PhD
in math don't generally so first we're
gonna have to peel off my nails and I
don't know how bad it's gonna feel about
this his brothers have to do you know
what feel poorness oh no well um do you
understand what you have to do I get the
I just scraped the fingernail off
can you just like stabbing me
Oh success you didn't leave her in great
condition well you did okay I mean we
got one full peel out of that it was
opened on you
they've all been ugly bugs it's art I'm
sure the people out there want to know
are you single 33 you're a 33 shit and
you're single shit here's my naked nails
gross all right what do you want to do
to me would you pick we picked wouldn't
peel off a scope
we shared a bedroom for a long time do I
want to know this story let's say for TV
you know we just talked about girls 13
you know 10-time oh girls man that was
probably talking about monkeys Ben loves
monkeys good he loves bananas the most
he does yeah oh okay I knew there was a
reason why he love bananas lucky monkeys
was young Ben's like defining
characteristic why because he had
nothing else interesting about him do
you have any embarrassing stories about
what Ben did as a kid oh I think mostly
have embarrassing story is what I did to
Ben as a kid does that count
yes I'm interested in this one time I
told Ben that I copyrighted all of the
names of his stuffed animals I had to
change the mini bride wait what he names
his stuffed animals I guess I just
learned what copyright was so I just
wrote copyrights like a boo-boo which is
the name of his monkey so you knew about
copyright when you were what 13 that's
right everyone's on Ben's Instagram and
sake
copyright or booboo I copyrighted it
first well it's actually from Disney's
line oh all right
we gotta pick some colors I have a small
selection yeah heard of this Hollow it's
good you can stick all of them can pick
whatever you why it's free don't touch
that one I'm just kidding look closer I
don't mean like empty I mean like it's a
hollow it's really really dark hollow
that's just black do we need two hollows
or is that do you want to double their
magnetic yeah you can yeah sure oh yeah
oh my god you're just like Ben hey Ben
you got this for me does Ben do this on
camera no bang tolerated that Ben always
does this with the little milk things at
a restaurant I want it to go that he got
for me hey you want to see what the
magnetic dish since you're like petition
great that is really amazing okay what
do you want to paint can we use all of
them you can use all thousand seven
hundred and sixty-four that's a really
good number
why square something that's really close
to like a famous number from famous
Indian mathematician was invited to
England and he shows up and there's a
taxicab and there's some number on the
taxicab and it's like something like so
four-digit number one thousand six
hundred and something and the British
mathematician remarks it's too bad
there's such a boring number on this
taxi cab and then the Indian guy says
well actually this number very
interesting it's the least number that
can be written as a sum of cubes in two
different ways or something sound cute
there's chained together you get a
bigger cube and that's the swing an
infinite number
infinite number but you can only add
together a finite number of full number
cubes uh-huh that's why I went into the
social sciences
do you ever offer tea services what do
you mean tea services thank you do you
know how to get people the team pick it
up and then move it to a person yes this
is your subtle way to tell me to get you
a tea or we could just ask that because
we're busy bad
I am was there a nickname for been
growing up I didn't really have any good
nicknames like Benji was me nowhere else
to go
I'll have a dark roast coffee no sugar
cubes but several mathematical cubes
can I get my chai squared please that
was really good
chi squared that's so this is gonna need
a few code oh I see but that's okay
we're learning here we have some parts
there's some stars spirals I don't know
if we have any like long division sign
isn't this cheating
you should just call using down my nose
cheating now I see why you might be
thinking right if you want to use nail
vinyls then you have to put a glossy
taco on and let it dry first oh hi Sally
that really like does I call him as a
low-rent why it's a Star Wars joke do
you like Star Wars as much as that likes
bananas oh I'm actually the knows what's
the joke here so take this glossy taco
you watch some of my videos that's my
favorite part can I just pour out of the
bottle no is there anything mathematical
about polish which we got here that was
one thousand seven sixty four bottles
bottles is it about an average of like
13 milliliters per bottle let's say
excuse me mister PhD in math okay for
those listening at home there's no
numbers in math PhDs yeah there's like
maybe the number one and two and E and
PI those are the only numbers you need
so if your math teacher talked to you
about other numbers just forget about it
so what do you do did you calculate
infinity actually yes that's one of the
first things they make you do in math
school what's the answer
what's the question what's infinity it
turns out there are many different
infinities the different sizes within
these some are bigger than others
infinitely many different sizes of
infinities if they need infinity oh
that's infinite to the infinity where
that would be okay to Heidi toss a penny
well you can't really calculate infinity
you know I just can a computer program
counter infinity oh great question give
me your answer
what is infinity uh I think affinity is
unknowable I think anything could count
to infinity because it's infinite right
so how do we know it exists actually
that is a great question we don't know
that exists we have to assume that it
exists this is built into the
foundations of mathematics that you
assume maybe for the X
the epistemology of math see sociology
matters to your decision to whatever you
do don't watch that numberphile video
about how the sum of all positive
numbers is negative 1 over 12 because
that's just ridiculous
oh yeah absolutely ridiculous you can
use that it's copyrighted I'm gonna cry
take my garbage why don't you want to
lose I thank you for the coffee
haters my ability to drink is something
wrong with your phone
I just like to enjoy it with all of my
mouth full oh did you ever think that
your brother would be famous on the
Internet
oh boy of any of the three of us my
siblings and I I thought then would be
the least likely to be an internet
celebrity why is that I've never really
seemed interested in like you know like
fame fame money and fortune are your
parents proud of Ben oh I don't know
proud is the word I would use maybe
confused I'm also pretty confused
I remember grade 10 man try not to do it
too thick or else it's gonna bleed okay
it's blue thick you don't want it to
bleed
don't let it get hurt oh my god I can't
look there's so much pooling better let
that dry no no this way you have to feel
it up now well it's wet because if you
let it dry it will get stuck but another
worked oh it's such a good job oh shit
not bad it was it meal or genius I'm
gonna have a hotel complicated me
illogical yeah we're just gonna draw a
little math symbol here about my old
times
yeah tensor that's not infinity oh yeah
I'll do that next
it looks like an eight sort of like a
snowman do I get that yeah yeah then you
say okay bye
okay well it wasn't to be an infinity
sign but now is this no matter what's
discipline that's not infinity infinity
is more like words and I couldn't do it
in a single stroke
you do to infinity then there you go
bitch check that out my infinity is
better than yours yeah bitch
when you said you would just colored it
in yeah I look better before I color it
in its gonna put a dot in the middle
join you use a dotting tool that's fun
well I think they look great you're just
missing my thumb okay why do you want to
paint on it oh just have to do you sound
like Ben Ben it sounds like me thank you
looks really bad actually yeah I just
said that to be nice little Ben here
looks just like him what do you think
Internet looks like him that's Ben
everybody now the last step to seal in
this beautiful manicure tacos it's fun
it says fun on it that's what we're
having do you think you're gonna paint
any meals again after this no I should
never again you think you want to I
would you rate your nail creation here
compared to what Benny did on my nails
which was the Andy Warhol banana design
oh yeah yeah okay so let's be real here
I mean I think this is obviously not
great my best work I think it's pretty
good you put your own personality into
it that's true I didn't just copy
anywhere all copy right that's right Ben
always stealing the copy right Ben Ben
and your Warhol that's like a 6.5 let me
dude pretty good points deducted you're
thundering exactly yeah if only he'd
been more original
