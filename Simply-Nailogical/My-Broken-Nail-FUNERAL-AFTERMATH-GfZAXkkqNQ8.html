traffic that's so strong so passionate
in this bed of hollow
it was a beautiful ceremony thank you
all so much for coming now that we have
all had the chance to properly mourn the
loss of my now it's time to deal with
the reality of a broken nail on a tofu
shop old oh I must interrupt this video
with a very important message because
yesterday when I took this video
screenshot there was nine hundred and
sixty thousand of you guys and today
less than 24 hours later there's a
million of you what I guess the
floodgates of hollow sexuals have opened
up and everyone's just having a huge
coming-out party today aren't you I'm so
proud of you guys
now I promise you guys a massive hollow
major ridiculously big hollow hollow
hollow ultimate giveaway at 1 million
subscribers on YouTube and you're gonna
get that giveaway but since this came
very unexpectedly and I have had zero
time to prepare because the game way too
bad it's probably gonna take me a week
to film the giveaway video but don't
worry giveaway has been unlocked
the lock is just stuck it sniffing it
will be unstuck soon I promise
and I just want to say a big thank you
to you guys for subscribing to my
weird-ass nail our channel that
sometimes I don't know
but take you so much okay back to the
video broken nail on a channel entirely
dedicated to nails you want to know
what happened don't you well for those
of you who follow my snapchat you
already know but for those you who don't
let's have a brief recap pibil relive
the trauma so one night everything was
fine and I was talking about how long my
nails were getting then I put on some
black Hollow which because it matches my
soul and this was just after publishing
polish Mountain and from that I got a
lot of new snapchat followers so I
thought I'd introduce myself hallo there
anyways I was talking about going to
work desk job like a normal adult in a
productive society being a smartass
can't really snap while I'm at work
because that is confidential bitch
so bye and then as soon as I got to work
and went to unlock my cabinet drawer
thingy
this happened
so yeah basically I was reckless and I
used my pointer finger to try and rip
open the door that I thought was
unlocked but it was really locked so
then I kind of just flung back on me and
they broke my nails it was so mean to me
but also I was stupid for using my good
hand and not even thinking about what I
was doing Christine ah so yeah it was a
very traumatic day for me as you can see
but I got lots of support from you guys
on Twitter so I'm honestly so grateful
and honestly you guys are hilarious also
add me on snapchat so I don't have to
show you my story on YouTube so you can
just see it on snapchat where it's
supposed to be shown yes all right back
to the reality I got to do something
about this I thought about putting on
some kind of patch or some kind of tip
extension so that I could preserve the
length until it grew out but honestly
this one time I went to a salon to add
some fake to the tip of my nail and
it looked like garbage and I'm never
doing that again
I also felt because it kind of broke off
a whole corner of the nail and some of
the layers seem to have come off on the
part that didn't fully break it wouldn't
really work if I tried to patch it up or
at least it wouldn't last very long so I
just decided to bite the bullet and cut
it down currently ridiculing myself for
posting this video in January the last
time I had a really bad nail break was
back in January 2015 and that's when I
had that fake tip on and took it right
off because it was stupid
so yeah breaking my nails is not
something that happens to me often at
all but I guess sometimes you just can't
avoid it I would have rather it be my
toenail in fact next time I open a
cabinet I'm going to do with my toes so
I don't risk my fingernails okay let's
cut this trader down I tried to use
scissors but yeah apparently I forgot
how you cut nails because I never cut
tails cuticle scissors will not cut your
nail don't work how do you
all Clippers at first because it was
just otherwise impossible to file picked
up one of my glass nail files lucky for
you I have a whole video on how to file
and shape your nails you can watch out
if you want more details because of the
way the break happened I didn't really
have a choice and I had to round out the
one side of my nail I should probably
pop my nail polish off shouldn't I Oh
would you look at that the way my nail
broke is revealing that only the surface
layer of my nail was yellow yes I'm not
a smoking crack addict after all keep
filing it down and come the inside cuz I
haven't had this shirt on now in years I
also just want to point out that my nail
did Bend a lot lower in the nail bed or
higher depending on the orientation that
are showing you this in because you can
kind of see a white scar line if you
will that's now going through my nail
just about on the smile line what that
means is that my nail actually bent a
lot lower in the nail bed when I hit it
on that stupid cabinet but luckily it
didn't snap that low it just snapped at
the edge of the tip of the nail which
was probably a lot drier and yeah
happens when you go to work so I'm not
going to work anymore I quit two bent
nail scar in my nail also means that it
will be a point of weakness until it's
fully grown out so I need to be more
careful now and also get other people to
do things for me I will never do
anything myself again and that's that
you got an uneven nail yeah I figure
I'll just leave it
asymmetrical looking like this until I
can grow it out a bit to then make it
more of a swivel shape because that's
the kind of shape I like on my nails and
now let me put some black hollow edge
back on my nails so I can pretend that
this never happened
what do you mean when nails shorter than
the other I have no idea what you're
talking about
at all I do have at least two nail art
videos that I'd already filmed before my
nail Jeff so you're gonna see those put
out in the next couple weeks don't be
alarmed plant health don't grow that
fast but after that yes I'm gonna have
filed down my nails to all the same leg
and I will take this opportunity to do
some nail art for short nails yeah
everyone always asked me this question
so yeah now happy that Christine
brokered out okay and all seriousness
guys short nails are not a bad thing let
me just make that clear
I personally I'm just used to long nails
because I like to stab people with them
okay so I'm hoping that in a couple
weeks when my videos with my new shorter
nails start coming out it will be a good
thing for you guys because you'll get to
see me do some nail art uncharted and
maybe the world will be a better place
yes probably yes
all right guys thank you so much for
attending my funeral I really appreciate
it subscribe to my channel because it's
free and I'll see y'all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
