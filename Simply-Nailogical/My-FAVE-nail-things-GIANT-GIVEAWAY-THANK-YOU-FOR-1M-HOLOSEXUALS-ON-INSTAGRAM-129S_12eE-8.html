sexual why is there like dust everywhere
been cheap Siler so many hairs 1 million
that that's to 1 million Paulo sexuals
on Instagram what an achievement for the
hollow sexual community I am so proud to
have helped lead this movement now why
do people call us hollow sexuals that's
a good question and it's mostly because
of you guys
a long time ago in one of my videos I
said the word hollow sexual and the
hollow sexual and ever since then people
started writing I'm a hollow sexual who
else is allosexual and personally I
really enjoy this term because it came
kind of natural you guys just started
saying it I didn't force it upon you and
it's also very inclusive because you
guys are hollow sexuals but so my we're
both hollow sexuals we're in this
together we got a major giveaway going
on to celebrate 1 million followers on
Instagram I'm gonna show you all the
goodies that 5 winners are gonna win
shortly but first let me blab on a
little bit about how much I appreciate
you guys and some youtuber machines love
speech speech I know everyone is waiting
for some amazing really inspirational
speech I'm not sure I have one of those
but I'd like to say a few words it's
crazy to think how much nail polish all
this behind me yes it's not a green
screen see it's not a green screen has
changed my entire life I don't think
it's even been 2 years since I've been
blogging about nail polish I mean I've
always enjoyed doing crazy things on my
nails ever since I was 15 in high school
I was the girl who would paint a
different color Sally Hansen prism on
each fingernail so I just looked like a
crazy teenager which I was and I was
completely oblivious to the online world
of nail art and nail art tutorials until
just a couple years
ago and after I finished my thesis for
school about two years ago in January if
I remember correctly I decided I wanted
to start putting pictures of my nails
online and I did that on Instagram and
on my blog simply an illogical calm that
no one goes to logs are dead hogs are
dead but what I also spent a lot of my
free time doing after I finished school
was watching funny and entertaining
videos on YouTube jenna Marbles
grace Helbig superwomen Lilly Lilly
Lilly even graveyard girls does this
thing really work so I was definitely
drawn to the comedians if you will on
YouTube and I really liked the stuff
that they did and the way that they made
people laugh and it wasn't too long
after I started my youtube channel which
was just pretty useless it was just one
minute tutorials no voice over no cool
editing pretty boring that I decided
that I wanted to do something different
with my channel and now I had the time
to do it because I was finished school
and just working full-time that you know
I got I got time to make the YouTube
channel working full-time it's fine
nail art and weird comedy twisted comedy
together and it became the strange
hybrid genre known as simply no logical
because I haven't seen it anywhere else
and now this channel and everything
about it is a major part of my life it's
what I spend all of my spare time doing
a lot of you guys will ask me can you
upload more or say things like well
so-and-so uploads three videos a week
why can't you I don't understand I'm
gonna unsubscribe and I feel like I
already work all the time to produce
these videos and they take a lot longer
to make than most people think
I do put a ton of effort into the actual
filming of my videos there's nail
varnish little effects different angles
professional editing software which can
take up to three evenings after work to
edit one video and my videos are longer
my videos are usually between 6 &amp;amp; 8
minutes sometimes 12 minutes if it was a
funny video where I was just having fun
it's so hard to decide which fun to cut
and so it is really hard for me to do
more than one or some
times two videos a week because I do
work full-time I know a lot of you know
this about me because I've mentioned it
before but I just feel like I need to
say it because people just assume that
youtubers only do YouTube and I don't
think that's a fair assumption and it
puts a lot of pressure on people like me
who have a full-time job to put out more
content I would if I could guys I would
do three videos a week if I could but I
can't unless you want me to die or not
sleep which would end in me dying
anyways that was a rant and a half on
the other hand it makes me so happy when
you guys write things like oh I never
clicked so fast because you were
obviously really excited and of all the
things that make me happy from doing
this obviously I wouldn't be doing this
channel or any of the stuff if I didn't
enjoy it is the reaction from you guys
I've never really considered myself some
kind of influencer or public role model
or inspirational anything at all kind of
just been in the background I sat in the
back of class I sit at an office desk
where I look at nobody all day so it has
been a bit of an adjustment for me to
see all these people get so excited when
they see my stuff and see their
enthusiasm when they write to me
sometimes it makes me nervous it really
does but it also makes me really happy
to be able to make you guys laugh not
just learn things about nails that's not
where my channel ends I don't think and
even if you're not laughing with me
because of the silly jokes I make you're
laughing at me because it's so dumb
either way I'm fine with that and I like
that and that's why I enjoy so many
comedy type youtube channels because
they're meant to be silly and funny and
you know just have a good time
have some fun before you die and that's
in my banner and this this only works if
you're on my channel homepage I've
received some emails and handwritten
letters to my P o box from you guys that
really make me all warm and fuzzy inside
I've even had dads write me emails
saying how much their daughters love to
watch my stuff or that they watch my
videos as a whole family event and when
Dad asked me how to build a nail polish
shelf for his daughter and I just think
that stuff makes me so happy to hear
that you're
your family's involved and bribing them
to build you nail polish shells and
Bayou hollow yeah you go girl you go and
it also makes me happy when I see people
who may have been otherwise
uncomfortable to share their hobby with
the world by that I mean I've had men or
young boys email me saying I'm a boy but
I'm really inspired by your videos you
make me laugh and you make me feel
comfortable with the idea of wearing
nail polish and that also means a lot to
me okay this is getting a little too
sappy we went from fun to sappy
stop it Christine what is this I'm
getting all like red and patchy because
this conversation is so sentimental that
and also the lights the lights are all
so hot humor and laughter is one
of the best medicines and I think that
just sums up my channel I mean yes some
things I do are stupid and you're never
gonna do it yourselves
but did it entertain you just a little
just a little then mission accomplished
and if you don't like my stuff because
my voice is annoying I can't change that
unfortunately I do get lots of hate on
my videos and in discussion groups on
Facebook and forum boards and yeah it's
ups it sucks because who likes to be
hated on but I'm old and I've been
through this before ten years ago in
high school so I feel like I've dealt
with worse all right
bla bla bla Christine bla this was the
most serious video I've ever made weird
so weird most of your guys's comments
make me so happy they make me smile a
lot of them make me laugh guys are
pretty funny who you all got a sense of
humor I love it everyone's like shut up
