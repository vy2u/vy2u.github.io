doing my face grow that tickle that your
armpit well hallo there so a bunch of
you suggested that I do a blindfolded
mani challenge I'm going to do the nail
art because I love a challenge because
this is a nail art channel sort of if
you're new here you should subscribe I
don't know what this is let's pretend
it's a dance now normally I would use my
other hand aka the hand I don't give a
 about because it's not in my
tutorials but I've been wearing this
nail polish for 14 days so far and I'm
kind of doing a test to see how long I
can wear it for so yeah if you're
interested in those tips on how to keep
your mani on forever you can watch my
other video the lazy girls way on how to
make a bun perfect a little sassy bun
sippy sippy the only thing I'm missing
is a blindfold and actually gonna like
what I'm about to ask him I need a
blindfold
with this it's an American flag why
wouldn't I have it don't use the tribute
whist no that's offensive I'm trying not
to be offensive okay I'm just gonna wear
the American flag instead doing origami
here I can't see how stops can you turn
this on like ions I don't know a banana
it's recording and is there is that
recording okay okay where's my hand here
here we go guys oh my god so rad I
thought I was so used to painting my
nails that I could do with my eyes
closed guess not I bet I'm like as good
as you know Oh what did you do
oh you look like such an idiot just
right now take a picture of me on Sam
check it guys I've been kidnapped
can't you see the reflection in my eye
oh my hand I don't know where to return
look a little left a little up there you
go
since I'm colorblind right now hey I'm
like you now Ben oh it really affects me
it actually does
you can't pick out nail polish properly
is this pink there's this big whatever
if you didn't think this channel is
stupid already then you certainly think
it now oh this is really hard just so
you guys know I challenge you all to do
this 100 coats of vine cold nail polish
challenge
just kidding never do that let's do a
gradient I'm so ambitious so right now
I'm just applying my liquid latex around
my nail maybe or on my nail I can't tell
looks great
are you laughing at me did you dare
laugh at your fellow Americans I didn't
really have a plan with this nail art so
I don't know what I'm doing this all
right now we're gonna add a glossy taco
on this nail cuz we're gonna add nails
next all the nail polishes are like not
where I put some future hollows right
they feel like hollow I smell like howl
well they must be Hollow fan I can't
find the cream where's the light cream
is it on the other doing no is this a
trick what's on the right what's what's
around here it's avenge II oh we got a
nice gradient on the sponge to look good
a little more green we're just gonna dab
dab dab now it's time to peel it off
yeah oh I can feel the porn oh no did I
get it on my Manny that I was trying to
keep for 14 days yeah um so oh I just
tripped every word in that maybe put did
I not put simply peel on great you
serious I got star vinyls cuz I'm a star
okay now I'm gonna peel the vinyls can
you feel it I can feel them but this
one's been peeled already right but I
can't feel the ones that that haven't
been killed ironically it feels like
it's struggling like it's too much it
looks like a star to me that's
definitely a star which one's blue yeah
which one's blue I'm cutting the sponge
is it under the camera don't you just
let pour it out onto the smooth no why
wouldn't you ever suggest that wasting
precious hollow not like I did that for
my intro or outro card at all I'm
putting it over the vinyl what does it
look like I'm doing beautiful yeah it
feels like it looks really bad I'm gonna
like pick off my skin cuz I don't have
no depth perception or or vision because
of what I'm trying to do is get some
pink hollow you know that likes trick
where they try to put to your fingers
together and you can't that's what this
is where's the brush I don't know
because it's not my body so I can't feel
that they're touching actually I don't
know they're touching but fries I trust
me feel for the brush why
oh my god some
did it yes victory is mine yeah
that's the end of a dottingtool get it
girl oh I'm getting so much of that pink
Paulo all right so we already this this
nail is done and looks great I think
it's just this one that we're missing
and well this is a lot to take in
like a lot to learn in one video but I
know that you can do it you're special
just like me found that I don't think
there's paint on it anymore doesn't feel
like you don't think so no can't find
the hole oh there it is slid right in
okay so what do we got is this that's a
gradient got a daughter cure yet nail
vinyl stars and I think this is a
gradient oh I didn't paint my thumb
start laughing em you're making me laugh
and that's why I'm screwing up it's
beautiful believe me okay Donald even
the haters and the losers I think it was
your best work then strip Oh something
fellas there's a rush on this one okay
what are you gonna draw I can draw a
smiling face
looks good right perfect
on to the next I think I need a hollow
taco look at that like the design really
comes out when you put a hollow taco on
doesn't it don't be afraid to get it on
your skin use your whole body as canvas
I can see that seriously oh yeah don't
know never follow any advice I give on
this channel I don't want to be sued
does it look like it's finished what do
you think then I need your opinion the
green could use a little something I
think okay maybe some glitter oh I want
the one that looks like coke use your
nose and find the blue oh this is gonna
be fun
he passed me the fan brush mister
assistant this isn't a game there's no
way glitter can look bad so maybe she
just don't dip your whole hand in
glitter then maybe I will that's a
vintage simply net illogical vintage
what do you mean what's that supposed to
mean my are you calling me old remember
when he used to do nail art now you do
your stupid videos
I'm gonna take it off now oh my god it's
so bright that's a good look for you
though
yo this is style like this I
didn't even look at my own I can't
believe I was that bad like really I
mean the good wood makes them wood cool
actually
