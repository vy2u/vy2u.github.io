Tuesday's an article and yes if you're
wondering my life has come to this we're
going to play games on the internet
for money you surely have heard the
tragic news that recently I broke my
nail as a result I have completely run
out of ideas for what to put on this
channel and so here we are
mi it doesn't sound like I'm screaming
at sounds like I'm screaming to myself
but I can't hear myself really what how
do you even wear these with earrings so
why don't you guys sit back relax grab a
cup of tea and watch me paint my nails
on the internet but not the way you
normally see that happen
let's play by the way I'm not making fun
of PewDiePie because I love him why
eight does that mean is four
eight-year-old facial games oh I'm not
sure if that one is appropriate for this
channel
what's happening oh we have to clean our
nails oh yeah they're so disgusting but
is that am i bleeding oh oh it's a rose
fat oh how nice
okay well I'm never using some clippers
on my nails so let's try filing wait
wait a second
are you saying that in order to do my
nails I must use a nail clipper
that's it this I quit you can you can go
die now goodbye okay all right Christine
stop being so dramatic
and we need to again take a bath bitch
Crown Vic okay
Oh No and now it's going to let me file
my nails understand nothing is happening
to the nails they look exactly
now you're gonna force me to use the
small buffer aren't you game is evil do
not recommend food Lube in a hand with
that
what no it looks like a water marble
now we're ready to go kidnap the Russian
because we're wearing them well what's
that in telephone no it's just a shower
for your hand what happens next
can I paint my nails Lauren is Saul born
Oh nail polish Wow guys I feel complete
again I want our flu what if I want
white
this game is offensive to me this is
strict in my choices so this isn't
really a paint your own nails the way
you want game it's a paint your nails
the way the computer has already coded
game but it's under the illusion of
choice so I bet you all kids who play
this pink that they're choosing what is
happening we have reviewed many things
on this channel such as children's nail
toys and we have determined that not
only our children's nail toys alive so
our children's nail online internet game
what has society come - oh it's glitter
where the hollando click click fast what
I don't I didn't want the moon there
what is this oh look now we're drawing
stars if I was drawing her illusion of
choice but no choice at all tells me
where to put things because it knows I'm
a child can't believe you don't what is
this a glossy taco
yeah it is an elastic at gun because
we're gonna and now but I know next hold
it together Christine the middle finger
my favorite again what if I want there
to be a hole in the middle what if I
want that it's not the same thing we
just did
no okay slightly different looks those
are many gradients what are we doing now
computer why don't you tell me dad dad
dad is that it's not a hog taco oh my
god that's gotta be Hollow right those
little rainbows in the in the
you guessed me you guys really need more
variety in your nail polishes I mean
after all you are a game that can make
up any combination of things what is
this
what happened do we break our finger why
am I using medical tape Oh No oh are you
kidding oh no oh no oh no oh oh no
what's happening I thought I thought I
left you behind me anyone who doesn't
know nail art or my channel watching
this thinking why are you making ice
cream what is happening here my friends
is that the computer game has decided it
wants to put us through the torture of
water marbling now we mix I'm not even
doing anything
that's not even how you water my oh just
even a computer can't figure it out
stick it in of course they make it look
that easy but um we all know the truth
with this I'm gonna have me out of
hollow taco just cuz it was to mock me
all right let's do the pinky gradient
and that's not even how you do it
properly
um okay now I have five nails that are
all different
next Sailor Moon oh now we get to
decorate ourselves oh my god it's just
change giving me joy
ooh I like this one fancy bigger Vegas
is beautiful so stylish I'm ready for
Fashion Week I don't understand what
what is this
no I want to save this okay well I
think I might have accidentally deleted
my Medicare so uh
 how do people wear these things
my users oh well that was a highly
entertaining game I'm sure you got just
as much out of it as I did come to think
of it I would be a terrible less player
do you think cutie pie is annoying when
he screams in the gameplay well I would
be even more annoying but where's the
Wow whoa

also a beauty channel noun did you hear
that I mean YouTube said it so gotta be
true all right rose
