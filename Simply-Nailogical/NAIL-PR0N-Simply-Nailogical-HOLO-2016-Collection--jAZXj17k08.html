god it's true it's real I have my own
collection of hollows my life is
complete I can now die goodbye just
getting got to stick around to enjoy the
porn introducing the simply an illogical
fun lacquer collection 6 polishes three
colors and two finishes it's available
now online at an Internet computer
machine near you I put some link down
below in the video description box and
this is an infomercial yes it is that's
what it's starting to sound like
Christine oh my god so much holo I'm
even know where to begin I'm going to
show you guys some video swatches of all
of these polishes and I'll let you in on
my little secret on how to make the
polishes super opaque and super hollow
glittery stay tuned until the end of
this video for that let's break it down
now we got three colors pink blue and
black they're all 100% holographic
glitters in a clear base and each of
them has a hollow twin meaning that on
top of the colored holographic glitter
there's also the traditional silver
holographic pigment within the hollow
glitter so it's like double the hollow
that's what the extra H in brackets
beside the name of these polishes mean
it means H for extra hollow but they're
all hollow don't be mistaken about that
personally I think either finish is
freaking gorgeous it's just completely
dependent on personal preference and
what kind of look you're feeling and if
you can't decide you could just get the
whole set there will be some special
discount offers on the day of release so
make sure you check the video
description box to see what deals are
going on now alright let's get into it
yeah up first is hollow Queen named
after me obviously tail King joking
everyone calm down
named after any magical creature who
puts this super vivid and vibrant
pinkish purple magenta hollow glitter on
their nails they instantly become a
hollow queen for my choice of color I
was inspired by the middle line between
pink and purple I really like the middle
of pink and purple for some reason to be
honest I've never seen this saturated of
a hollow glitter in a nail polish before
sure companies will make the jelly part
of the nail polish like the Bay
so the nail polish this type of hue but
I've never seen it in a hollow glitter
itself before FYI all of my swatches are
sponge Don with two coats of glossy top
coat I'll show you how I did that at the
end of this video how did it not even
mention the boxes yet with every polish
from this collection comes a holographic
box so even if you don't like nail
polish you can buy it just for the box I
know you're up there I see you next up
hollow Queen H that means with extra
hollow pigment so as you can see it
makes the polish look a little more
silvery but it is the exact same magenta
pinky purple hollow glitters it's just
got a crap load of extra hollow added
into it if you didn't know fun lacquer
is very well known for her holographic
glitters she is one of my favorite
brands who make these that is why I
entrusted this sacred mission to her and
she will often do a regular hollow
glitter plus the added H version of the
same hollow glitter and I think it's a
really cool concept and so I wanted to
continue that tradition the next polish
is one that we should be singing to
anyone remember this video how deep is
your hollow is lack the ocean rainbow in
motion Oh cringe my voice is so great
yeah by the way have you seen my music
video I have for a long time wanted a
super pigmented vibrant royal cobalt
blue in a holographic lip and I knew
exactly what to name it after that
stupid song I started singing kind of a
rhetorical question how deep is your
hollow is it like the ocean of course
it's like the ocean I mean look at it
the prettiest ocean you've ever seen hey
you want to come over later I'm having a
pool party on my nails and oh look
veggie hair of course Michie you are
everywhere get film a video without her
now it's time to say hallo - how deep is
your hollow 8 version even though I
really like the blue just by itself
because the color is so awesome and
bright I think the 8th version is so
pretty and gorgeous because it really
gives it way more rainbows and yeah I
like rainbows the added hollow pigments
do make the blue color appear a bit
lighter it's kind of cool all that works
but that's
time it's very three-dimensional
obviously my nails are 3d but you know
what I meet right there's a lot of depth
to this polish I've saved my most prized
possession for last
introducing black hollow which you heard
me I actually named it after which when
I say the term which on this channel I
mean it as a compliment I mean it as
something that represents magic and to
me this 100% black holographic glitter
is both dark and edgy and enchanting but
at the same time it's magical and
captivating because you can see so many
rainbows now true story I have been in
search of black holographic glitter in a
nail polish for centuries it's actually
so rare that I've never seen one like
this before
most polishes you think are black hollow
glitter are usually just silver hollow
glitter and a black jelly base there is
a difference Roback to this video I have
yet to find black hollow glitter in its
purest nail polish form but I will never
give up my search ever one day I will
find you and so several months ago I
enlisted the help of fun lacquer to
complete my life goals by realizing my
dream of a true black holographic
glitter nail polish and she delivered on
her quest some may try to replicate it
but she just can't beat the original
black hollow witch a witch of which I
consider my hollow child please take
good care of her
if you adopt my children and to round
out the collection we've got the extra
hollow twin of black hollow inch black
hollow glitter is already so rainbow II
because hollows reflect best with black
so you got a black hollow glitter with
extra hollow on top of that to the extra
hollow reflects off the black color
glitter making it all the more rainbow
oh my gosh so much to take it I know
okay now that I've showed you these
amazing holographic polishes and you've
already added all of them to your online
shopping cart and clicked by now let me
show you how to apply them so they look
on your nails like how they look on my
nails first step I always always always
always start off with a peel off base
coat no you don't need a peel off base
coat to have the glitter look cool on
your nails but it makes it a hell of a
lot easier to get off your nail you're
going to start applying the glitter
polish
with just one thin coat on your nail to
make your nail a little bit sticky don't
worry if it's just a little bit of
glitter on your nail right now you
actually don't want to make it all thick
and gloopy because the next step is
sponging on the glitters which is going
to make it opaque apply the polish to a
latex free makeup sponge and sponge it
directly onto your nail this way some of
the clear jelly from the Polish actually
absorbs into the sponge and leaves more
glitter goodies behind on your nail you
could do this two ways you can work with
a small corner of the sponge in small
sections like I'm doing or if you're
feeling a little messy you can just
apply a liquid latex barrier around your
nail and sponge it on that way and then
peel it off after you've covered up all
the nail you can add one more thin coat
of the glitter if you like and then seal
all that glitter goodness in with a
thick glossy top coat or a glossy taco
depending on how I'm pronouncing when I
use super glittery filled polishes like
these I often add a second glossy top
coat this helps create more of a smooth
finish and in case you were wondering
you can use the exact same sponging
method for the hollow twin version of
each of these polishes I've been
sponging on glitters since I was a fetus
I never put on glitter polish any other
way to be honest in my book this is the
only way to apply glitter nail polish
and when you're done since you were
responsible and put on a peel off base
coat you can peel that glitter right off
your nail mmm
Kiel part it's almost as good as nail
porn but not quite as good and that's my
collection leave a comment and let me
know what you think and oh hello Benji a
cat is here to visit no matter what I do
I just can't keep her away from the
hollow she came out to me one day I was
Hollow sexual and I was very accepting
Oh mom look at these pretty hollows oh
I'm distracted by the solo paper Oh
hollow polish oh hello paper help I
can't make up my mind I'm a cat all
right guys thanks so much for watching
and thank you for your support for
bringing me to a place where I could
actually have my own holographic nail
