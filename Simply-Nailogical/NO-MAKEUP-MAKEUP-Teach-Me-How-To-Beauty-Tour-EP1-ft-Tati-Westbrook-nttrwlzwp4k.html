welcome to the very first episode of the
teach me how to beauty tour today we are
here with taki also known as one of the
most beautiful faces on youtube hello
i'm going to teach you as many tricks as
i can in a short amount of time and how
you do today is teach me how to do a no
makeup makeup look you know I've seen
you've done a lot of everyday makeup
tutorials on your channel maybe like 27
already but I still haven't learned so
we're going to have to do it here guest
thing you need to know about no makeup
makeup is that you're only going to need
to do about 20 steps you can do this so
I can
this every day you can do it first
things first I normally put on my
eyeshadow No well you could do that but
we're not it we're not going for a no
makeup makeup you don't want to do mine
at all
no I shot what about like all the lines
and shit I got veins you know so that we
can cover that Hollow I do don't do
drugs keep children primer primer this
is what I would consider a base coach
for all the nail polish lovers out there
this is my base coat your base coat I
think she watches my videos the
Porefessional but I got a copy I'm not
going to keep I'm not going to let her
do this for me the point is is that I've
got a model off of her and try and learn
and then you guys can learn too because
if I can do it you could do it oh wait
she slowed down should I put this
everywhere everywhere we're going to
beat ourselves with a sponge later just
save your strength
okay I don't want the video to be
demonetized okay no violence
very feel nice they're going to let
everything glide right on and just look
prettier
now this is perfect for our no makeup
makeup because it's literally called a
tent what's a night tent that's for
another video
okay this is a tinted moisturizer it has
an SPF 15 in here it's going to
moisturize the skin so you just grab a
little bit this is like you're tricking
the eye you're going to make everybody
think like yeah I have I have perfect
skin sighs it's all orange off is it
supposed to be no but we're using my
makeup mom pop pop pop you say God dab
dab make it people look fab oh it kind
of looks like toothpaste like I was
going to face didn't drink yeah whoops
this is actually yes yes to say shoot
shit and I'll go down my neck a little
bit that's what you need to do what are
you saying I'm saying that you just need
to plan
oh you sounded like a commenter saying
you need to make your face match your
max I look that I was going so I have
we're like going for maybe a glowy no
makeup makeup look except that I don't
want to look like you just how do I do
that thank you
okay we'll get there did I do okay did I
pass this level she gets I would say in
a - there's rules there's room being too
nice for them this is one of my
favorites from the drugstore it's
affordable it works really well instant
age rewind oh did I do this do I lose a
year I would really like me 27 again
okay so you just don't under the eye you
way - when do we use them ABCD cream or
BB CC BB ee f f GG no GG that's what I
normally use is that what you use to
cover your face you can't with us like a
lily white
which is kind of old why don't you put
it on her face do we see this is
actually orange where's a creation
expired in the year of 2015
what are you doing your mom where can I
just use this as the blender no well
then why does it have a sponge on it
that's touchy and nice it sucks oh she's
kidding I used to do dot but I heard
that's not in style and not is on trend
anymore how do you stick this giant
playing and your designee on you have to
be fearless take that sponge go for it
but the good news is with makeup you can
always blend anything out so if you mess
up and then it looks like no makeup but
makeup Wow all right let me see what
grade you get on this will actually
think you get an a really good with that
so what's the next step miss Potter is
going to take this new clean flush from
l's and have a bunch of different colors
like check it out like very little
squishy so it's all so familiar okay
don't you need powder to put on the wet
stuff though not always really Instagram
made me believe I always need to use a
setting powder or face powder here's the
rule if you're going to use creams like
a cream blush on top of a cream you want
to do it on top of a cream not on top of
powder otherwise it'll by rail right
okay so make your dad get your ink blush
brush a regular brush into cream I
always thought you had to use like a
finger or spongy smile and it gives you
like such a nice little glow which is
going to look like a very realistic
flush you can kind of go back on top it
looks like I'm blushing looking like I
know and in the presence of beauty it's
a lot it's a lot it's a lot you need
your baby water and you need to like do
this business I am actually learning
things I'm amazed I'm going to go ahead
and say like maybe maybe we have little
room to work with the blush people
b-plus I did better than that in school
a little bit too wide with where you put
it like you want to make sure you kind
of just has to be here I'm going to
school you my eyebrows you're going to
wet spoolie my eyebrows like a printer
school you know when you send something
to the printer and it says spooling I
never saw so what do I do I brush my
hair you have a pencil or what do you
use to put in your eyebrow normally
thanks for Instagram honest awesome
Emily helm okay you're going in for like
the real legit stuff that is hardcore
this is not for a beginner you're just
your training wheels and things like how
much I'd use your what are you
contribute to your bro how are you using
that much oh dear Lord
I like to chop it up before I start I
thought the serial Tyler said her bra
Lanaya though I've seen her brow makeup
done so I already know she can actually
handle the brow situation so does it
feel weird that when your subscribers is
sitting right beside you and trying to
learn how to make up with you I'm not
kind of like I've never thought about it
that way I had it you got a nice shape
in there you filled them in give me a
great I'm gonna give you a - just
because there's room to kind of even
them out if you yeah - just your face
like this that you can embrace like how
would I want your face so I got some fan
brushes for us I used to be a fan but
now I'm an air conditioner you do climb
to her first or we're not going to what
is this endo makeup okay okay she wants
full glam scare I just hearing like
where's the contour because that's what
hits me I'm just grabbing on the brush
yeah I've got it you guessed it I'm
going to turn my head girls you got it
and you're going to just go I have faith
in you on this one you're going to do it
and you know oh right it's not not so
pretty and you can kind of like your
highlight by doing this business okay
wait I got to be a beauty guru me my
moment is malfunctioning listen what
highlight that's really important is
that you use a shit ton of it okay I
usually layer like six different types
of highlighter just because I can't make
up my mind is that normal and then you
can start taking it on the body
- because that's always fun like I like
my shoulders have a lot of fun and have
their own moment about federal
government greatest daddy sometimes I'll
take like my finger in the highlight pan
okay like look how much more you can
grab like right boo beauty guru mothers
and what they do they go like this they
go I could hold on I gotta practice
I'm gonna just do one two three baby
dummy blinded by the gods who are you
watching going online your eyes yeah why
not look at this look at this but
breaking all the rules okay well when I
got a lot painful - icing okay that
highlighters better on the face this
month this is what I sometimes like to
do with no makeup makeup or minimal
make-up I won't use an eyeshadow palette
at all that so I was using the
highlighter as my shadow and I'll just
take this contour powder keep the excess
off budget competitors it's a good way
to not suck it do any makeup I always
just like stabbing into my hand first
that mom um you might ruin your brush
doing that but I'm not the point here am
I ruin your brush it's going to like do
windshield wiper motions and the crease
just check machine
foreign language look were you ever bad
at makeup No
you're doing good
no one talks about this no one does this
is a real secret right here hold you
brush like you're kind of going to stab
yourself in the eye how do you see I'm
going directly into the socket Wow
as opposed to what if it would appeal a
lot of people will do this and they'll
go smear that collar where shit I do
this right no you want to go straight
into that pocket oh my god I am learning
things right Monta master nerd
Oh slowpoke wait so do you have any
mascara tips what should I be doing
to make it look good the best mascara
tip that I ever knew about was from a
makeup artist her name is malli Ron Cal
you want your eyes look more awake to
kind of push your mascara almost toward
your nose because then or your nose yeah
because then it makes your lashes in the
middle stand straight hub which makes
the eyes go you know they kind of go
that way like peace bitch I'm moving out
west ah what the hell are you doing nope
I always do this no my god use this the
fuck is that it looks like an eye
Lemaitre like it's gonna rip your
eyeball out of a pot eyelashes we're
doing no makeup makeup here really and
you are going for the child
Instagram change they didn't even tell
everybody with mascara anything how are

talking about what product well I'm not
sponsored so I'm not gonna mention oh
that was a pretty good one cuz I don't
know what the fuck it is has these
drawings all over it Fairey draw how do
they do I would give you an a-plus on
mascara is it really hard to grow up
like a plus yes but you're missing a
little bit with the needle action so

beauty heck no are you ready for like
