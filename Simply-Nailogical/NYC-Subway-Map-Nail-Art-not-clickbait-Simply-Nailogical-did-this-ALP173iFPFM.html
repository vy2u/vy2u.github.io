right next to Jake Paul it zum-zum with
jiggy-jiggy
don't know how I made it there
tell by my attitude that I'm most
definitely not Bravo
oh well hallo there would you like an L
art tutorial well well well hallo
everyone it's me hircine again and I'm
back with a yes the title is not
clickbait an actual nail art video yes
you may go ahead and leave your jokes in
the comments first off I just wanted to
say I'm sorry that there was no video on
this channel last week though there was
a simply me illogical uploaded to my
second channel simply not logical if you
feel like watching me open mail for 26
minutes last week I was in New York City
for a YouTube hosted thing called the
creator summit I saw some YouTube
friends and experience life outside for
once but I'm happy to be home with my
fluffy children and of course my new
fabulous nail polish elves and working
space so happy that I actually sat down
and did some nail art being in New York
inspired me to put New York on my nails
even though I didn't actually need to
travel at all because my inspiration was
actually drawn from this t-shirt that
I've been using as pajamas for years
yeah it's the shirt you wear every
fuckin night to bed what do you want me
to say I'm a Taurus come at me bro
alright so grab your tea settle in and
watch me do some nail art that you're
probably nothing to do but that's fine
because you've arrived just in time for
some peel porn oh yeah
I like to relax when I start out a new
nail video you know what I'm saying of
course I'm gonna have to censor the
nudity we can't risk YouTube slugging me
it's not advertiser friendly first
things first we're gonna start out with
a peel off base coat oops got a little
bit on my skin oh wait a second what's
that on my other hand
yeah goes right in today we got this
sweet kind of aqua teal mermaid esque
shimmer polish I could see myself
swimming in a pool of this can you all
right for the base of the subway now
we're gonna go with a nice black creme
polish one coat only that's how I roll
and as my snapchat fam knows most of my
nail tool stuff is still not unpacked
and it's all a mess so I could not find
my yogurt lids but I did find this TV
and blank CDs are probably worth like 10
cents these days so I'm just gonna use
it as a paint palette acrylic paint to
be specific because here's a nail hack
for you and guess what it's not stupid
but it also won't change your life when
you want to hand paint some fine details
on your nails it's much easier to work
with acrylic paint rather than nail
polish because you can water down or
acrylic paint it goes on a lot smoother
and it doesn't kind of glob up like nail
polish mind if you're using a tiny brush
to paint it and it works just fine no
one even knows the difference you can
also scratch the acrylic paint off if
you make a mistake if you can't do with
nail polish notice how I added a nice
thick coat of glassy tackled before I
started painting on the acrylic paint
now that is gonna give me a nice hard
surface to scratch off the acrylic paint
if I fuck up of course you gotta let it
dry first okay so the iconic New York
subway t-shirt map is it accurate I
don't know let's take a look
oh look at that it doesn't look too far
off from an actual map now this is the
fun part because I wanted to use
accurate real representations of the New
York subway system intersections and put
the momentum so on my middle now I
painted this section around Grand
Central Station which I don't I don't
know if I've even been there I always
start with white first to help lay the
roadmap roadmap and then I added the
color-coded tracks on top of the way
not gonna lie this wasn't the easiest of
nail arts to do because it requires
keeping your hand pretty steady and I'm
a little bit out of practice okay you
know simply get an old even been
couldn't believe that I was back at it
what are you doing Benji what is she
doing
I feel well-traveled didn't New York
inspire you meet me on the subway bitch
it's like modern day that's what I was
going for now we got to add the white
dots which I gather represent stations
or entrance points for the subway and
here again I'm using acrylic paint with
a dotting tool you could just use a
bobby pin but I'm a fancy bitch okay now
I kind of up here just a little okay
maybe a lot because I had tried too hard
to squish three station dots on this
short little green track I wanted to
squeeze in at least one of the numbers
so I picked number four and put it on
the other side of the tracks because
that's just where I hadn't room okay
you know while my goal was to be
completely accurate and be able to take
the New York subway system using my
nails as a map sometimes in art you've
got to change it to make it work perfect
do you take the four train well you do
now and then for the rest of my nails I
used a different section from the New
York subway t-shirt map and then it was
time to add a nice thick coat a glassy
taco and filled that all in oh don't
mind me I have a little bit of seepage
or flooding as we call it sometimes I do
that on purpose because they like to get
it all over the nail you know what I'm
saying
all it requires is a little bit of
cleanup with a stick but we good after
that how about we do it again and on my
other nails
oh it look so good now for whatever
reason acrylic paint looks a little bit
textured under just one glossy taco so
after the first coat glassy taco drives
I like to put a second coat of glassy
taco and there we go New York subway
nails what do you think simply no
logical just did nail art yep this is
not a prank I think they look pretty
good and honestly I'm surprised that I
haven't completely forgotten how to
freehand paint you know what I want to
try though it's making them matte yeah
cuz when you add a matte taco over
something that has black in it it takes
sometimes the awkward reflection of the
lights and the shiny surface away so
that way you actually see all the train
lines a little clearer they definitely
do look more like the t-shirt when
mattified you know what I also want to
try though oh you guessed it we're gonna
add a hollowed out go oh shit you know
me too well
I'm just using one very thin coat of a
scattered hollow taco cuz the people
still need to see the map you know they
still gotta get their directions and
then we added another nice thick final
coat of glossy taco after that because I
am addicted what's your name oh my god
it's so beautiful
now these are the real New York City
lights
but wait there's more
no we're not adding another hollow taco
but do you remember when I applied the
first coat of glossy taco before the
acrylic paint
yeah well oh shit that was actually a
black light activated taco so it's not
quite glow-in-the-dark but it does glow
with a black light and I think it looks
really cool now no one can tell me that
I wasn't the life of the party we're
gonna play a game where you try and
pinpoint on the map what each nail is
from because I did these nails to scale
okay like this is real I didn't just
make up lines to scale or not to scaler
are you talking whatever you can use my
nails as a map of the subway
they're real parts of New York okay here
let's start with the pinky should be the
easiest sit there is that right yep okay
that one's easy
hey how about this one motherfuck it's
not exactly this one's not to scale it's
a dotted line that it's not exactly to
scale I didn't have enough room to put
the 4 on this side so I put it on the
other side okay it's close enough that's
Grand Central Station you fuck yeah it's
a tiny Central Station okay but I'll see
you got none of this is funny is there a
brand car down here yeah this one was
like a warp tour to follow I've been
there
not good city planning that's what
happened there armpit yeah I kind of had
to imagine what happened after here
because I don't know the rest of the map
didn't we buy this shirt at the top of
IBM first a blank choice yes and I also
gave it as a gift to my dad six years
ago it didn't so I thank God I kept it
now I can be like do your nails match
your shirt that's something I ask myself
a lot can i end this next week on simple
analogical here's a hint really well
