normally on this channel you guys have
been asking how I did my fabulous makeup
so let me show you how I make my face
all on fleek and such I'm going to be
really good at this I think I'm gonna
need a new name simply make up logical
simply face logical simply make up
sexual sounds probably a little intense
give the new intro makeup poet yes don't
forget to click subscribe to my channel
to become an official simply face fan
why am I still in my cat pajamas err
oh you can't see it how's the word
makeup on it I swear the shadow timah
now from wake up and makeup and these
people for hooking me up with his shirt
so I watched a bunch of makeup videos on
YouTube and Instagram ones of course and
now I am fully prepared to Glen the
phone out of my face I'm really serious
about this change in direction of my
youtube career okay I'm a Paula's Ain
first thing first there's such thing as
a peel off base coat for face washing
the face this is cold water now I'm
awake I got a ring light I know see I'm
doing this for real
exfoliate not taste good by sugar
washing the face again what order am I
supposed to do things and I don't
understand toning the face this is how
you get your face in shape it's a toner
on it moisturizing the face is like it's
too oily to put makeup on primer that's
what this is right it's a shine killer
we're going to kill a shiny bitch today
grade 7 headband oh it's like Lube
that's weird
am I supposed to do my face makeup first
or my eye makeup first
no one ever explains this color
correcting cuz my face is always wrong
doesn't come with a brush the hell man
and I guess that's what these are for
don't know which brush is for wet though
lat top kabuki that does not help me
wait a second
obviously why didn't I think of this
before and I use an elf concealer brush
you know like the cleanup brush for your
nails this looks like an eyeshadow
palette i'm just kidding i did some
research okay
so first we're gonna go in with green
and put it on things that are red so you
got Christmas oh no that's not red oh
shit that bit hmmmm this is kind of fun
ink you're supposed to blend this shit I
only bought this sponge thing because
the internet told me to me it just looks
like a gradient sponge except weird
shaped and pink wait a second why don't
people just use makeup sponges on their
face like these there is something
someone is not telling us and seal all
the random colors I just put on my face
Hey look it's like a Dada cure Wendy
Wendy Wendy foundation Tam but you want
to put some cement on her face I use
this color all the time so I know that
it matches my skin tone perfectly ah I
always see people dropping some kind of
magical oil into the brush what is that
nail oil sure why not can I say I'm a
pro it's cold so I'm just going on with
my what I think is my foundation brush
and it's a morphe brush and you can get
a discount of 10% with my code simply
face is kidding the freshers run from
morphe oh I just realized I'm covering
up all my freckles not sure how I feel
about this I'm a beauty vlogger and I'm
smiling I don't see that every day
bought these two different contouring
palettes because I didn't understand why
you needed both but someone told me to
get both how do I know what shaped my
face is that's not in here just gonna
paint it on like a trail of poop hey I
say to contour in the hollows of your
cheeks
I got imagine they were saying put holo
on your cheeks that would be way better
next we got a contour that double chin
because of all those salads that I eat
what other big notes should I even be
contouring my nose I don't understand
how this works am I supposed to clean a
brush but if you want to highlight your
entire face I was it so dark and it's in
the fair-skinned palate is a fun fact
for you and I was in high school I used
to work at Shoppers Drug Mart as a
cosmetician that's like the makeup
people who greet you when you come to
buy lottery tickets those are only in
Canada so there is an 80% chance you
have no idea what I'm talking about
Drake worked at chop stroker so you
might know it because of that I also
danced in the middle of the aisles I'm
just gonna go ahead and bake my face
that's why they call people cake faces
because they baked a cake on their face
it all makes sense to me now taking a
darker one why so serious
I'm snorting make better just look like
dirt on my face that looks weird a new a
new one do there's powder everywhere
ticklish now let's add some blush to the
apples of my cheeks for the oranges of
my cheeks or all the fruits of my cheeks
time to highlight which color should I
use since the highlighter never open
boxes with your nails but I really
wanted to get the island Kryolan what at
Mikey from glama Gor uses but I couldn't
find it it was sold out everywhere and
doesn't even ship to Canada he'll never
be beautiful am i the highlight of your
day why do people highlight this weird
there are some things that long nails
are not good for oh why is it white time
to draw on some eyebrows it never felt
self-conscious about my eyebrows until
Instagram that too much I'm a comb you
little caterpillar honestly this just
looks weird
I really don't get this part but I'm
gonna do it anyways look who's smoking
now lot of people blend so good someone
else please come do my makeup I've
really appreciated glam i Gor
nikkietutorials made you look I'll do
your nails
I shadow in my eyeball hurts I want some
fleek liner or some shit striping brush
actually that would work perfectly well
see now art tools can be used for markup
it comes with a brush thing duh I need
some mail Lionel's I want an angel wing
up I have too many eyelashes for the
number of eyes that I have like a coffin
for my makeup funeral are you supposed
to shake this first I'm just used to
nail polish bottles I am terrified never
worn fake lashes before I don't think
that's right like I'm gonna cry I don't
being aware these I got them because
there's iris Beauty ones that all the
girls on Instagram reasons think they're
too big for me these come in different
sizes so down get into more eyeball all
I see your eyelashes the power of makeup
at one time in high school I was using a
safety pin to separate my eyelashes and
then I stabbed myself and I don't know
why they call it a safety pin so I was
gonna buy the Kylie Jenner liquid
lipstick in true brown beige brown KKK
or something but all these make up
bitches boss mom and I say KKK I'm sorry
I must've been confused with King
Kylie's nail polish collection anyways I
got color pop instead because it sounded
like color club I know my lips are
really big and I'll try not to be
jealous of how blessed I am at birth you
may think I have small lips but really
that's just because you're so used to
seeing big ass lips on YouTube and all
over Instagram someone once asked me
where my upper lip went this shit is
good someone else once asked me what was
wrong with my teeth oh it's on my teeth
and I think we're done shut up
now I'm beautiful mmm my hair is like
out of a 90s porno or something
here's the before and after oops I mix
them up
notice that beauty bloggers never smile
and their final after shot is that it
looks so sad probably because they
didn't
use any hollow on their face couldn't
find any hollow makeup to put on my face
does anyone sell that I normally make
nail videos lots of them but even if you
don't like nails you're allowed to
subscribe to this channel I invite you
alright guys thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
