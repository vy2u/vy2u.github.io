from your boring lives to my boring
Channel
not too long ago Tati of the YouTube
channel glam life guru posted a video
using these nail polish markers and then
a lot of you guys asked me to have my
way with them as simply now on a logical
is supposed to be about nail polish
that's what I do most of the time yes so
I got them but let me tell ya it was a
hell of a time getting them here to
Canada at first I was told they would
not ship to Canada so I had some order
to my contacts and the US of A will not
disclose who my contacts are only had
three in stock so that's all I could get
from that hookup but then they said they
could ship to Canada so I ordered all of
them but then I went to my P o box and I
found that the company already sent me
all of them so now I have a load nail
polish marker so I hope that they're
good look it's like a nail polish marker
Centipede holy shit look at these skills
it's like good let's begin one coat full
coverage color manicure on-the-go
application shake well before use yeah
suck away of on it can use us YUM oh
that's just the French says use on bare
nails only for even application you mean
I can't use a peel off base coat I'm not
gonna listen to that at least for just
these two nails my pinky and my pointer
we'll do a test and we'll fee
woah it's white that's not what I was
expecting maybe you're supposed to press
it down on some shit come on out come
out wherever you are
I feel like these are those paint
markers you press down the tip and then
the liquid pulls out and you always do
it too much and then there's too big of
a pool
say nothing I think I smell nail polish
deep down in the pen my mother I'm gonna
turn to head shake well and push the nib
down for 45 to 60 seconds oh okay maybe
I'm just painting a patient there's
nothing in here maybe she's too dry
let's try another one you gotta loosen
you up baby try this eye game oh this
one's actually like pressing down like
in and out like I see her she's leaking
oh yes success Vic Dottie is nice now
it's just like a marker oh okay okay
let's take this seriously Christine why
do you never take anything seriously so
I have no nail polish on this finger now
let's try whoa wow wow and the tip ah
I'm so expressive today so it's on my
nail I don't know the woman's a little
streaky on the first coat I wouldn't say
that it only takes one coat I think you
need two coats but I kind of get the
impression that coloring it on top of
itself would ruin it
let's find out I still find the brush
thick and not easy to get into the very
sides of my nails pink the basic bitch I
gotta tell you I really don't like this
part in fact I think doing this and
pushing it down is just ruining the tip
how you get bent I don't think you want
that it's performance will not be as
good the pink is coming it's coming
every doll I'll put it on my middle
finger also no base coat on this nail I
definitely think it's kind of fun to
draw like it's markers on your nails
that's fun right we all did that in
school anyways it's not that easy though
to get the complete
even application I feel like it's kind
of patchy and there's a hair at the end
of it I don't think that's the markers
fault that's my cat's fault definitely
gonna need a second coat so I don't know
why you market yourself with one coat
cuz you napped adding a second coat is
tricky because even though the first
coat is definitely dry the weight of the
marker and the pressure is just like
ripping up the first layer come on man
hair you can kind of see what I mean but
maybe a glossy taco will fix that now we
put some black seed Kakos on so the taco
smoothed it out for the most part but it
still looks really bumpy just being
honest
sue me motherfucker let your fluids flow
that worked fine what are they saying it
has to be on your bare nail they just
don't want you to use anyone elses
product I see what you're doing okay
next color this this fun vintage Vance
so original
yeah there we go again this is over the
peel off base coat I find that these
markers are a lot harder on curvy nails
if I could find a product that didn't
shame my curvy nails I would be less
offended a last color we have here is
red a classic red and if that's what I
want I want lipstick markers I think
those basically already exist can't
forget about you mister thumb I'm just
gonna put it out there and say that this
wouldn't be any easier to do on the go
as they say you need to be sitting down
to do this properly definitely not on a
bus and I would not recommend doing this
at an office meeting I think the red one
actually coats pretty nicely still needs
a second coat but it looks like it's the
most even application of all or maybe
I'm just getting better we'll never know
it's really hard to make it not
tricky when you do the second coat maybe
that's the look maybe that's the new
fashion fault trend
streaky now let's put some tacos on the
wrists why didn't they make a top coat
pen huh I guess the question that
everyone wants answered is is this
easier to use and is it better than
actual nail polish a lot honestly I feel
the same way about these things as I do
about spray can nail polish focus on the
positive things Kristine focus on the
positive it's a marketing gimmick to get
your money just companies trying to find
new creative and innovative ways to get
paint on your nails without actually
doing the work of painting your nail so
give it to them for that the creativity
yeah marker nail I apologize that the
friend ended up sending me these it just
doesn't do as good of a job as just
painting your nails you also have a lot
more color options that way and most
importantly hallow options I don't see
any hollow pens here nope I don't think
any hollow sexual could live this kind
of life I feel the tip of these is quite
thick I would like it to be a little
thinner so you could have some more up
precision action around the sides know
what I'm saying but let's be real no one
comes to this channel for serious
reviews do this no you come here for
stupid shit let's do that on our nails
can't really see it but that's nests
like your grades
Alex pretty well on to do with all of
these mark I know how about we draw some
pictures okay men do you want to help me
draw some pictures is this a draw my
life no we're not going there look I'm
draw a pretty picture with me is this a
video yeah I'm drawn here are you drunk

fuck you love is that look Maggie it's
you do you like it no she doesn't she
doesn't like quick where's the water
marble the witch has to drown so here's
the puddle sing help she's working on
this scribe and try shit
so cheese what's into this is what
happens when a regular person is not
good at painting nails normally uses
nail polish markers does it mean
something when a guy has one nail paper
it's not like a philosophical question
no okay funny thing okay how do I get
this off it looks like I went crazy on a
blueberry Danish looks like you fingered
a blueberry dick
do you like what I did online this is
the kids channel is that appropriate

appropriate hot hot peel porn in your
area well should I draw to draw your
life with nail polish fine draw my life
