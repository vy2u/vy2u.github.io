Russians hate her dr. oz dr. oz dr. oz
what do these things have in common
they're all secrets that are lies and
they don't actually work sorry for
misleading you with the title of this
video one in on the Russian secrets well
you can't have the Russian secrets
because I'm not Russian and I have no
idea what I'm doing
today we're going to attempt this
magical witchcraft rules of a Russian
nail art is so many done by none other
than Sveta Sanders form Instagram at the
very least you will see how elusive
these Russian secrets are because I
absolutely fail at achieving them and
then we're going to end up doing this
which doesn't look Russian at all oh
well time to see me try I went for some
soft and springy colors even though it's
late August applied this pastel purple
down first on my nail check out my new
nail art brush pack I got from twinkle t
yeah you can get it too if you use Mac
code simply for 10% off so many brushes
to choose from including a water marble
tool on the end there I'll never use it
for that let's start on my pinky finger
so I apply a thick coat of the purple
stuff and I'm already floating in my
cuticles things are going well so you're
supposed to just drop in the second
color of polish into blobs but some
people do this and I call it a blob of
hair I did one of those once upon a time
you probably thought when you watched it
that it was easy but it was okay so what
the hell does Fett to do now so she
takes that water marbling tool thing and
drags the points
no no no this is not a Russian nail art
secret you lied to me let's try this
again on another nail
let's try one of the thin paint brushes
instead look the tips are purple don't
get me wrong it is cool but I wonder
what was going through the manufacturers
head I want all our brushes to be purple
actually no make it just the tip right I
did the vlogs with you big and now it's
a monster oh well let's practice anyways
while we're here this time I'll just
take a thin paint brush because I think
that's not going to make me scrape the
bottom of my nail it's like training
wheels okay I mean if the Russian is
able to use this hard edged water
marbling tool to do it you know like us
Canadians and probably Americans to need
to use a pee brush to do it cuz it's a
little softer and a little easier in any
case this now looks like the story of my
life next okay don't do the blobs as big
this time
got it things are gonna work out great
how do they do this this isn't even
making any sense or resemblance to
what's fetch it did never going to give
up never gonna give up that's me
never gonna give it up never gonna let
the brushes down oh look this one's not
absolutely terrible it somewhat
resembles what she did guys look if
practice makes perfect
Vence Mehta must be approximately 282
years old ok now I've ruined almost all
of my nails good thing I wore my
favorite peel off base coat under all of
them because I knew this was gonna
happen
polish on top is still a bit wet but the
base coat dries like a saran wrap layer
it's actually pretty cool if you just
gently push at it then it will peel off
everything as long as you don't poke a
hole in the Polish that you're peeling
off and then the wet polish bleeds
through this is what I'm using but
currently sold out at the place I always
get it from but you can sign up at the
link below to be notified when it's back
in stock yeah
and yes I'm going to do if you'll all
face off being thingymajig you will get
to see how this compares to glue and all
the other peel-off alternatives spoiler
alert this one's gonna win I'm just
going to blame my failures on the color
combo and I'm gonna try this darker teal
holo because maybe it'll be a little
more pigmented and the Russian nough
swill come out better drop those gloves
drop them like a tack or cold cuz it
looks cold whatever those blobs don't
look proportional but let's try it
anyways the darker colored works better
you never see what's happening sort of
or you can at least see what's not
happening here can have two Russian
magic but we're slowly getting the idea
right guys
yeah I did this one too far down on the
nail and then the other thing about
being Russian is that you have to be a
perfectionist so even though this might
look okay to some of you out there it's
probably because you're American or
Canadian so in spirit of trying to be a
true Russian this is not perfect I must
redo it so you're coming off and so are
you and you can see clearly now the blob
occurs on I can see y'all drag obstacles
in my way did you guys know that I once
sang as a professional singer no I did
okay well this may not be good enough
for a Russian but it's good enough for
me I'm moving on
I made the blogs a little too small on
this one ooh this one's not so bad it
looks the most likes fattest asbestos
spec I don't even know if I'm
pronouncing that right I'm really sorry
to my Russian friends I can't pronounce
your names not so bad and huh
okay now how did you the middle nail
this is serious business I've been
training hard for this oh my god I'm so
nervous let's hold the blobs perfectly
oh no that one is crooked
please don't trip up please don't screw
up
doesn't have the pulling in cool effect
though she has like these X things
around corner okay well whatever
a Canadian tries to be Russian in part
one kind of looks like a bunch of
rabbits that ate a whole backyard of
green leaves decided to throw up on my
mails so now I'm going to try and save
this manicure by being a French person
as you know it's a scientific fact that
Russians are just good at everything on
nails but French nail artists are
especially good at freehand I have
confessed before I don't actually know
how to paint as you probably seen in my
video on how to pretend you can paint
when you actually can't so here's my
attempt at being French and painting on
some rose gold foliage or something an
attempt to save my manicure from the
Russian graveyard didn't really work out
it still did put a top coat anyways cuz
you know you gotta move on with your
life even when you have a nail fail even
though it looks like crap there is one
thing we can do to save this manicure
from the dead I had a bunch of hollow
glitter to it of course so I normally
add a color topcoat everything but this
time I thought why not add like a chunky
hollow glitter to the whole thing is
this darling oh c'mon you can pick it up
on pre-order now at the link below my
dad so much rainbow so much sparkle I'm
gonna die if you're having a bad day or
any nail fell you literally just have to
get hollow glitter on top of it and
you'll instantly feel better watch this
is how it goes my nails are so ugly
everyone's gonna hate them puts hollow
glitter on the nail oh my god I feel so
much better right now look through the
rainbows over here I don't see any field
so that was one coat let's add a second
sheet get even deeper into that hollow
glitter dreamland yeah I instantly feel
better about myself
take that Russian nail artists they
won't even know what hit them obviously
I mean absolutely no offense to Russian
nail artists or nail artists of any
ethnicity for that matter but I'm just
telling a few guys how do you do it I
know it's in your genes you were born
with it don't lie okay some of us were
not more in Russian so we just need to
use the holo good or secret and there
you have it that's the secret how to be
Russian first you try to be Russian and
paint your nails like them and then you
fail and then you just put hollow
glitter on it so everything is fine
alright guys thanks for watching don't
forget to use my secret when you're
having a bad day see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
