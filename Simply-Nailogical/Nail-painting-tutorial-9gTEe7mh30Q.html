know it's been a while since I've done a
nail tutorial on this channel so I
figure now's a good time today I'm going
to teach you how to paint your nails
let's get started shall we
good thing I didn't break my now house
first we file our nails normally I
wouldn't recommend this step but today
we're going to bust them
oh yeah nice perk add a peel off face go
now we're going to do a hollow glitter
gradient and dab it on beautiful now
we're going to add a nice thick coat of
glassy taco let that dry like my sense
of humor because we're going to add nail
vinyls neck
and you gonna peel it up beautiful we're
doing a few minor touch-up and then
you're going to finish off your nails
with a final stage coat of glossy taco
don't forget to do all five of them and
that's it we're done here
now that don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for other great tutorials and if
you don't hit subscribe then go screw
yourself thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all later bow could you even
tell this was an April Fool's joke or
did this just seem like another normal
video for this change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
