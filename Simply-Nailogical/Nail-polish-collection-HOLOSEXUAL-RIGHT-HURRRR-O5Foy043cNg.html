- arranged by brand or by color
that is a question all nail polish
addicts face at one time or another
oh hey Minji Christine you're so fancy
today what's going on this video is
really unique and no one has ever done
one of these before
look I'm a youtuber showing off your
nail polish collection so original right
now it's okay if you want to murder us
all I know how it is so I know that a
lot of people store their nail polish
collection and drawer systems the most
popular ones being the IKEA Helmer or
its craft store want to be the melmer
why would you want to hide your nail
polish from the world don't be ashamed
come out of the closet the drawer and
show us your nail polish nail polish
attics be like our so much nail posh I
am by a third hammer yeah you do that
you go hide your nail polish in a drawer
I think that as long as your nail
polishes aren't hitting direct sunlight
on your show better build yourself some
shelves and give your nail polish the
attention it deserves out and proud
girls out and proud you can watch this
video on how we attempted to build them
so counting my nail polishes is like a
lot of math and time I have around nine
hundred and something let's take a tour
shall we
let's start with shelf number one random
top and base coats as a chur the Dimond
king cupcake hollows they're so cute
why have I never uses the floor I mean
look at that green guy's look at it it
attend that we use French fur there once
was a Polish don't tell me you never
learned anything in my videos a England
the world's most elusive hollows because
they live in a castle somewhere in
England
nf ooh Oh new foo-foo oh I don't know a
nephew Oh hollow plus aqua vase remember
when they told us that you needed a
special base coat to make hollows pop
yeah we know that not true something's
not right there steel is French for
circus look how good I am at French
these are all my colour club hollows and
if you can't find them anymore in stores
it's because I bought them all so her
cat has don't hate me
I may have way more than one per color
every nail polish attic notes you need
backups anyways can't take any chances
oh hey there look two color Club hollows
that couldn't fit on the color Club
hollow shell awkward randoms that don't
know where to go Oh saw teeth colors
baile row dance legend and a llama squaw
ulema squaw lana squad it's a lamb squad
that's what it is
enchanted polishes another brand that
hides up in a castle so no one can find
them these all sell out in approximately
two seconds every time they restock and
you may find them listed on eBay for
ridiculous amounts of money look I'm
taking a picture of this polish picture
polish water only have seven what is
wrong with me look green and now it's
purple my mind is blown Lake is so many
delicious places I'm going to eat them
all these are all a bunch of Starly
multi chrome flickies both with a
regular twin and they're hollow twin oh
my god more fake is that I'm dying this
is I love nail polish or iln Peas
massive flaky line also multi chrome and
they to each have an evil hollow twin
lure I can't fit them on one shelf these
polishes are so glam
I was so low in Christine stop making
jokes stop it boring stuff stamping
polish that I never use and smells like
car paint acrylic paint for the odd time
I do one stroke
never and some stripers in a bottle that
I've had for approximately 12 years I
was shelf number one let's move on the
shelf number two because it gets better
from here but then it gets worse Natal
my god glitter I don't even do that many
glitter placements I think I've only
ever done one that I made a tutorial for
but look at all this glare from twinkle
tea you can get 10% off with my code
simply and you too will have glitter
herpes all over your house here's some
other random craft store glitter that
I've never used and basically some
bottles that couldn't fit anywhere else
I see you milky glitter and I hate you
alright now let's have some real fun
with fun lacquers and like that I have
three shelves where please don't kill me
while we're here some of you asked in my
last video on how to build this now
fellow shelf how I made two rows it's
quite simple actually we just bought
some flat mouldings cut them to the size
of the Shelf and then spray painted them
black shoved it to the back of each
shelf and bam we got two rows one for
polishes and one for boxes or more
polishes whatever you want I love fun
glitters they are one of my all-time
favorites boo holla top coat oh my god
like hit all the hollow gutter this one
was a victim of a nail porn the one for
my intro actually oh yeah brush swipe so
good
this was fun lacquers recent limited
edition collection and no you can't buy
them anymore because that's what Limited
Edition means it also came in hollow
boxes try not to be so

hollow glitters are recent ones by star
Lee whoo hey there Big East back to some
more I love nail polish what if you love

polish bike apt some beyond the nail
from Canada if you're Canadian comment a
in the comments painted polish hollow
glitters I don't think I have enough

flakies that are all trying to be like
se shine of the times and of course as
he discontinued it brewed shelf number
two had you at hallo
oh hey man G I almost forgot you were
there now let's check out shelf number
three we're slowly getting more boring
now polishes I shouldn't have bought
while I was at the grocery store thanks
for nothing Loblaws don't do it oh my
god oh don't do it you know what they
say XOXO color gossip my grandma bought
me this polish because she still thinks
I'm 12 now polishes that wish they were
the real OPI the real OPI I don't really
care for OPI all that much it's so
mainstream guys I'm pretty sure this was
one of my very first hollows though so I
still love you Brenda Mindy brand beside
OPI OPI is not happy with that nail
polishes I shouldn't have thought while
I was at the mall more nail polishes I
shouldn't have bought while I was at the
mall random random Orly hello mirror
ball that I've never used does anyone
else think that aurélie is short for oh
really
here's Kuo by oh really I mean Orly Ho
is the Canadian version of Orly and is
sold in Shoppers Drug Mart which is our
version of Walgreens or CVS I think
here's my a/c polish collection it's
always a struggle to decide which face
of Essie we should show should we show
the letters and white or should we show
the glasses in that time all nail polish
brands went magnetic remember when se
made awesome hollow glitters yeah
neither do i random color clubs that
wouldn't fit with my color club shelf
some textured I'll never use again
mmm no I'm bored of these crams
some nail polish that smells like
something when it drezz that's very
unnecessary when color club finally
realizes what's good and makes hollow
glitter taller club minis that everyone
loses this one looks like laundry lint
old school color club bottles what up
some see act a you know it exhale tag
you some n CLA with an a on the end this
one's a feel like n CL ANC attic
could go on a date together we already
know which one's gonna put out beyond
yes for obnoxious nail arts I got my
flask glass you not plus your teeth
disease and my models own will not turn
you into a model at time when Zoya Pixy
dust was all the rage these two polishes
are trying to be zillah's
thank you third shelf let's move on to
the fourth shelf and the most boring of
all that time you went out to buy
backups of Sally Hansen's Pacific blue
because they said they were
discontinuing the original formula Sally
Hansen why do you have so many different
bottle styles it's really annoying and
it's messing up my shelf look okay like
one two three four five six seven stop
it why Sally why Rimmel whoo legit
copied one of selling Hansen's bottles
more Rimmel and the original Rimmel oh
sorry I meant to say Rimmel London
random polish that thinks it's China
Glaze
a very used yellow how did that happen I
never use yellow maybelline sleech neons
that went flying off the shelves last
summer that time you're in a really good
mood so you buy a bunch of random neons
some China glazes that have really
settled because I'd rarely use them
China Glaze neons and some more China
Glaze oh look that's a staple random
extremely old nail polishes that I would
put in a drawer because I don't even
care pretty sure these used to say
Charlotte Russe Revlon really doesn't
look good with a J quick better get some
age defying formula a black sheer tint
that I made myself in used beside some
color sheer chance that I bought and
never use random too expensive friends
that I've never used random extremely
inexpensive brands that I've also never
used is a duck on this one I have no
idea what that is
the only nice color
and what's that some more nail polish
that I made a porn with and spilled
everywhere
good luck those are pretty never tried
those before random rejects from my
what's the best white polish video eggs
waiting to be moved for the moment I get
more nail polish a bunch of minis that
are cute I guess why do people like
minis I really hate minis they're so
awkward to hold file these under nail
polishes that don't work for eight
year-olds and there you have it that's
my collection and that's my cat man
chih-hao men she feels when she thinks
of playing cram polish how she feels
when she thinks of Hollow well yeah oh

gotten in the last year has been sent to
me by now Polish companies who want me
to promote it on social media secondly

job you know those things that you get
money for doing that you can go spend on
