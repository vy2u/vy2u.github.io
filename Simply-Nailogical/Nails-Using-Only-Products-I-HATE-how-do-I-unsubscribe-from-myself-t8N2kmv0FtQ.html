again and I'm naked
don't look stop looking you pervert so
for a while now I've seen this trend
going around in the makeup community
where beauty gurus do their makeup using
only products that they hate and I
decided eh I could do that but for nails
because as you may know if you've seen
any of my videos before I've used a lot
of shitty nail products and also we just
radiate positivity on this channel to
start things off we're going to use this
glue peel off base coat then Ice King
paycheck look of it makes me want to
bond
not only do I hate glue peel off base
coat but this particular one is just
terrible the brush looks like it's
fucking drunk if you're into really
unsatisfying peel porn don't forget to
stay till the end of this video as is
always the case in makeup land just
because I hate a nail product doesn't
mean that you're going to hate it what
doesn't work for me might work for you
cumplir all individual would you look at
that she does just my opinions but
sometimes people still get really bad
the melon okay so since I have 10
fingernails that means I only have room
for ten things that I hate about nail
we're going to start off using a really
shitty black nail polish my definition
of that is one that is really streaky
and not opaque in one cooked sinful
colors committed to sin with this one
actually on that note a lot of people
actually like this black nail polish and
they find that it's very opaque in one
coat I personally do not I bring up
another good point that sometimes
companies with makeup or nail polish
have back issues maybe I got a bad batch
I don't know all I know is that I hate
this one okay now we're going to cover
that shitty black polish with a really
shitty matte talk matte top coats are
supposed to mattify the nail this one
just makes it
look like shitty gloss all right what's
next this is fun I feel like I'm getting
at all.i anger I was going to do my
nails in order but the glue on this nail
isn't even dry yet
milky-white polishes you're a long time
hollow sexual then you will know that
that's another thing I fucking hate
white polish has no business being milky
I doesn't look as bad as I remember it
might be because this is super old and
have gotten really sticky and goopy
another important thing to note so
people don't attract me is just because
I don't like this SD polish doesn't mean
that I hate se although su doesn't
really have any interesting nail polish
like mostly time boring and now I'm
going to draw a heart on my milky-white
now with this Kylie Jenner sinful colors
nail polish not because I necessarily
hate it but because I think Kylie Jenner
herself does we like her own nail polish
I kissed it though have you ever seen
her wear her own nail polish line after
she was done promoting it just nice just
like we're gonna take this brush I don't
hate this brush I don't really have
anything against brushes we are going to
draw a heart because you hate heart if
someone buys me heart-shaped jewelry I
would throw it right back in their face
hear that men I just think hearts on
nails are boring and ugly I know I just
makes them so question made the glue on
the finger is finally dry so I'm going
to use another white polish that I paste
and then we're going to add this ugly
sheer neutral cremes not hollow polish
so it's kind of like the nude classic
bitches boring bitches nails look then
we're going to use a drugstore glossy
taco that does not dry quickly one that
I definitely hate the most are any of
them that say they're a base and topcoat
okay that's like two-in-one shampoo and
conditioner it's bullshit so where's
your dinner and a glossy taco that's
shitty because say with me now we're
gonna add nail vinyls next Oh
who missed that comment down below and
that's shitty nail vials from Amazon
does leave sticky residue
I hate them we got to wait a bit and at
least try and let this nail dry even
though it's calling it a pink like till
tomorrow see you then now let's do a
gradient using creme polishes that are
pretty in color but that just are so
shitty for doing gradient let me show
you why normally when you're doing a
gradient you want to be using really
opaque polishes these ones are just
really transparent you need like three
coats to make the color really pigmented
and oh look it's my old friend the pink
cow the liquid latex that I absolutely
hated because it stains my finger pink
and it just didn't peel well almost
gross Cupid the applicator like these
applicators are for your lips right does
it look like I'm putting on screen lip
gloss we're going to take a shitty
makeup sponge and this one's shitty
because it's not dense at all and I find
that the sponge easily falls apart and
then you get little pieces of sponge
stuck on your nail and then you might as
well be sponge male SquarePants let's do
a little sideways gradient here damn
damn you can't even see the colors
anymore it's just all blended into one
ugly mess let's do a second coat show
nothing against color club I like some
of their all own nail polish so three go
for but these ones are just so shitty
and impractical for anyone doing nail
art basically so now we're going to peel
and it's going to be a big deal because
this shit is garbage it's not supposed
to rip apart like well if there's a
mention here I'm just painting my thumb
with this blue Kylie Jenner polish that
is streaky and on top of that we're
gonna do stamping because I've decided
that I fucking hate stamping not because
these stamping products are necessarily
bad but just because I'm not good at
stamping so therefore I hate it let me
know down in the comments if anyone has
bought one of the things Kylie
collection nail polishes great acronym
good job alright what design should we
do for those hearts those kind of look
like really hard I hate it
perfect I don't have a stand for a shit
pull off so you're bad at this say no
kidding that does not pick up literally
at all
because I spent too much time looking
for it I can use some spray acetone good
I hate there finally you come and Andy
oh I just seen hate cleaning stampers
okay I'm not cleaning it not I'm just
going to use different pattern oh look
more hearts okay let's do this one Mon
we must work quickly
I'm so fucking awkward there next we're
going to go for a simple look using this
plain silver glitter nail polish called
queen of beauty look at that beautiful
silver glitter time we're just gonna dab
dab dab to make your nails look drab
this poor nail polish has to live its
whole life without ever seeing a rainbow
why not hollow it's so painful now
polish have feelings too you look like
you're having a hard time then value oh
my gosh thank you thank you for the team
what do you think what do you think what
do you think
Thanks why is this smell like coffee so
this is a video of things you don't like
you underrated me and now we're going to
do a water marble and I hate this Kylie
Jenner polish and I especially hate
these fake hollow polishes that were
advertised as holographic companies have
some nerve these days so I'm just going
to pile in an assortment of nail
polishes that I hate for one reason or
another probably because none of em are
hollow alright that looks like shit
perfect just going to dunk my thumb in
there oh I think that turned out really
nice what do you guys think thumbs up if
you hate yourself too now we're going to
use these stupidly overpriced Christian
logo tans and I hate these for two
reasons one
they're not worth 30 dollars the polish
is Nathan Powell this yellow is also
fuckin ugly and also because these came
in a set of three and one of them broke
those can follow my snapchat you would
have witnessed it the glass at the top
of the bottle was so sin and I
s-so shittily made that it just seemed
broke so therefore I hate these some
sorry people who like designer labels I
know I'm not going to be able to sit at
your table anymore but we add some weird
sway to this one look at that modern art
let's go back to the nail vinyl nail
peel up one of these French tip things
stick it on the tip now it's been a good
half an hour to an hour since I put the
glossy taco on so it should be fine now
let's peel and let's just cover you back
up and we'll try and make the best of it
how about some fake pink hallow sure
there you go beautiful and how about we
add some loose glitter
that's not how low are you detecting a
trend that is just disgusting nail
polish markers sounds like a great
genius idea but what the fuck is that oh
yeah that's just beautiful love the
coverage perfect and while there are so
many more things that I hate I only have
room to show you one more spray tan nail
polish it's just one of those inventions
that nobody ever needed shit in this
totally mess the side of my nail no fuck
we're given on this day and now no
manicure is complete without a nice
thick coat of shitty glassy taco all
right cue the montage of this beautiful
masterpiece
since my nails are done now and I just
hate them so much
you can guess what time it is tanpopo
Hana - it's like so wet disgusting and
now to remove all the little pieces of
nail polish left behind from that shitty
peel job we're going to use none other
than this spray King nail polish remover
brace yourself
oh yeah you're not even supposed to
spray I hope you enjoyed this video of
essentially me torturing myself you're
welcome I would do a makeup tutorial
with products that I hate but I'm not
sure if I hate them or I just don't know
how to use them if you have any
suggestions for nail products that you
think I'll hate she'll be afraid to
comment them down below or tweet me on
Twitter and I love roasting shit okay
it's like my new hobby I'm really good
at spreading positive vibes and positive
energy into the world
whoa JK you know what else I hate when
youtubers tell you that they have a goal
of how many likes they want to get to on
their video because who cares
instead I challenge you to go watching
youtubers if you hate that means
watching another one of my videos and so
be it remember to be positive good
things come to those who wait sometimes
the best thing you can do is not think
not wondered I'm just it said it's a
positive quote let me spin it just
breathe and have faith that everything
will work out
this is a good one
you can't live a positive life with a
negative mind that's another thing I
hate
bullshit Annoying quotes which have no
grasp on actual life okay
that's all for now I hope you hated this
video and thanks so much for watching
I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
