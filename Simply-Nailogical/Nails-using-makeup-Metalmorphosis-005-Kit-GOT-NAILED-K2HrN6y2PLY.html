well well hallo everyone it's me
christine again in my last video you had
the pleasure of watching simply face
logical teach you how to do the metallic
gold digger look oh yeah over draw the
lips yeah you're welcome I use products
from the hot new metamorphosis kit which
is all the rage in the beauty world
right now just because this channel
simply now logical doesn't mean simply
face logical can't come out and play you
know what I'm saying she wants to play
too girl but then I had this thought I
wonder what it would look like if I put
this on my nails and that's what we
gonna do today we gonna put the fancy
makeup on our nails and surprisingly
this wouldn't be the first time I've put
makeup on my nails now there's
definitely nail polish that already
exists that looks pretty much exactly
like this when you put it on the nail
but that would be too easy wouldn't it
so let's play first I took the clear
water mixing liquid with a yogurt lid
and this is a shot that everyone hates
where I took the knife right to the
middle of the metallic eyeshadow
the powder got rekt it got wrecked
then it crumbled into a bunch of tiny
pieces and I poured the water on
top of it makes seem mixi look at those
Trixie's
ah why am I putting this on my skin
again right this videos about nails so
it's definitely nowhere near as
reflective as what I'm already wearing
on my other hand which is a coppery
metallic polish I put the link for that
below I mean it's pretty out of the box
for makeup but on your nail it's it's
kind of underwhelming you know what I'm
saying we've already done all of this
hmm
but wait a second what if we just take
the raw powder and then rub it on our
nails like you do with the chrome nail
powder or the multi chrome nail powder
oh my god I'm genius I tried this over
gel polish how you normally would with
the chrome powders and this is what I
got the gold and silver turned out
metallic II enough but the coppers are
pretty dull I mean it was a good idea
but it just does not get you the same
results as you would using actual nail
chrome powder this is what it looks like
when you mix three of the shades
all right let's switch gears and go back
to trying it with the mixing liquid I
found that when I use this stuff on my
face it was most metallic when I mixed
it with the mixing liquid all right all
right interesting very interesting I
like how it kind of falls like a
waterfall I think that's because it's
resistant to the topcoat of the nail
polish that I have underneath of that
but yo what if we substitute the mixing
liquid for just clear polish or topcoat
guys there are so many experiments that
need to be done in this video get your
lab coats on right now see the science
screen I could have probably done a
better job at mixing all the pigments
thoroughly together but it ain't nobody
got time for that it definitely applies
a lot more evenly with full coverage
after having mixed it with clear polish
interesting but still kind of useless
because you could just buy nail polish
that look better oh I know let's dry
brush with it since it's already kind of
messy and doesn't want to stick to the
nail that looks cool cam into it guys
I'm gonna go with the one on the left
that's kind of a messy dry brush
gradient of the three different metals
whoo let's do it with the makeup on my
nails starting off with the peel off
base coat because I am a peel porn
addict
I tried rehab it didn't work instead I
just came out with a peel porn video
go watch that if you want it's free of
charge next I'm applying a black gel
polish why I don't know I should have
just stuck with regular black polish but
initially when I did this I figured I
would be using the powders and rubbing
them into the gel fast now what I ended
up doing but I'm still using gel if you
want to do this at home with the $200
makeup I would suggest just using a
regular black polish as the base gel
polish wouldn't be necessary all right
we got some melted copper now I'm just
gonna messily streak that at the bottom
of my nail I really love how runs on
your nail when it's wet so Arup utak
next up gold this one is my favorite
it's so shiny
ahh I don't think I did a good of a job
at mixing this one but whatever that's
the look we're going for
finally the silver this one I didn't get
the chance to play with on my face cuz I
didn't know how to incorporate all three
it's so pretty but if only it were
Hollow know what I'm saying you do whoa
it almost looks Hollow oh my god trying
to trick me you see that a little pink
shimmer there you can go back and add a
second layer of each of the three colors
if you like just helps build up the
metallic a little bit more and I'm kind
of liking this look it instead of a dry
brush it looks more like a marbled floor
maybe one that Donald Trump would own
cuz no one else would be able to afford
it without a small loan of a million
dollars it's missing something though
and no I don't mean Donald Trump's hair
I decided I needed to paint some black
sharp lines on my nails to suit the mood
and that mode is cut a bitch with your
glue so this is just black acrylic paint
nothing real fancy here I find a kerlick
paint is a lot easier when you're doing
details like this alright that looks
edgy and random perfect to dust off any
random that may be lingering around
and now we're gonna add final glassy
tack and bam now I got metamorphoses
nails to match my face ooh
so matchy-matchy again this look could
definitely be achieved using regular
nail polish and it'd probably be a lot
easier to do it that way to be honest
but that would be just too easy and it
was kind of fun using makeup to do my
nails it's kind of like a challenge hey
why don't you let me know if you want to
see more of me doing my nails but with
makeup comment down below which kind of
makeup I
to use it's got to be special and
something that's you know in with the
trend so that all the beautiful people
will cringe when I proceed to chop it up
and put it on my new still waiting for
holographic makeup though to include all
these holographic glitters you get me
all excited but the megavision Allah if
you're new to my channel here's an
example of what the makeup could look
like if it were hollow this is nail
polish but let's just pretend for a
second these are three different linear
hollows that's what they're called
because there's little rainbows in them
that kind of look like a bunch of
rainbow lines I didn't have a true gold
linear hollow but here's a silver hollow
and a dark bronze hollow and an orange
II pumpkin home and the one thing they
have in common is that they all got
rainbows here let me teach you makeup
industry this is the scoop of
holographic nail powder it's ground up
into very very fine particles now I'm
adding the magic mixing liquid because
oh my god this is this is actually
pretty genius guys hold up a second
oh my god I want to swim in that hollow
pool right now I'm gonna draw myself a
bath and I'ma pour a bunch of challah
powder in it and mixing liquid this
bitch is going swimmin
now look at those rainbows dance do you
see it do you see what I mean do you see
the rainbow
that's what hallow is now for the true
test
putting probably not FDA approved for
skin cosmetic stuff on my skin don't
worry it's just my hand but I think I'm
onto something
know what I'm saying I want this but
cosmetic grade Hollow powders that I can
actually put on my face without any
foreseeable risk attention all makeup
company if you'd like to develop
cosmetic grade hollow makeup consider
collaborating with me I have much
experience with hollow rainbows unicorns
and himself identified hollow sexual
hope to hear from you soon oh that was
just me planting some hollow seeds
alright that's all I got for today like
this video if you support the holo
makeup movement and thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all later bye
