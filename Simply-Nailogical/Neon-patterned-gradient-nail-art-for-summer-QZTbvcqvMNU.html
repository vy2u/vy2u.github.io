have to excuse my easily sexy man voice
that I got going on so I've been a
little sick
maybe I inhaled too much nail polish so
I don't really know what to call these
neon pattern nails let's get started I
feel like I'm always repeating myself
but to do a white base and I just used a
french tip white nail polish because
they're the thickest and most opaque in
one coat I should probably make this
whole white nail polish mystery thing
its own video maybe one day when I'm not
dying if I simply feel liquid latex
barrier on the skin around my nail to
help protect from messy gradience
you can watch a video all about these
peel-off magical wonders a video picture
link thing in the left hand corner you
know it's dry when it sparkles this
sounds even worse when I'm sick and dad
visiting probably the most new yani
polishes I own neon
is that a verb per word Adam I got them
all from live love polish the link is in
the video description box below and I
apply them on a regular makeup sponge
and sponge Mon with quick light dabs on
the nail and look at that after only one
coat it's super thick and opaque oh my
god I love these neon polishes a lot of
people ask me how I clean the sponge
well I don't actually clean it but I
just cut off the edge when it gets a
little too thick and so quick polish
then you have a fresh edge and look at
all that just that I've cut off they're
so pretty and Nia and then you can make
a flower or designs are hanging on your
wall and people think you're crazy
just sponging on a second coat for good
measure this polish is so fun just fun
really
but don't sponge on more than you have
to because then it'll get too thick when
you're done you can just take a
toothpick or tweezers or whatever and
peel off the simply peel latex barrier
as you can see it comes off in one nice
swipe super clean and I only have a tiny
tiny little bit of paper on my cuticle
but like that's a pretty good job if I
do say so myself
Thank You liquid latex you have
literally saved my life never mind just
my cuticles with my actual life
so I just take a little bit of an angled
eyeliner brush and acetone to give it a
tiny little bit enough left add a quick
dry top coat it's here we're gonna put
on nail vinyls so you want to make sure
you've sealed the base and so when you
put on the nail vinyls it won't rip off
you're pretty great
I'm using just some straight or striped
nail vinyls from twinkle t-dot-com you
can use my code simply for 10% off your
entire order yes and I'm just gonna
stick them on my nail in a triangle form
I'm using the same white color club
polish that I'd used as my base to fill
in the Triangle here so it's nice and
opaque in one coat remove the nail
vinyls really quickly with tweezers
before the polish dries and I'm taking
just a random striping brush I got off
Amazon and some black acrylic paint and
outlining the triangle now honestly it's
like super hard to film this kind of
detail on camera and if you notice my
other nails the black line is actually a
lot skinnier and you'll see later that
the pattern is a lot better on every
nail that wasn't filmed so that's just
like the downside of filming because
whatever I film is gonna turn out worse
than all the nails that I didn't film
and then you're probably just gonna
think well she's obviously a liar if she
can't even paint it on camera there's no
proof that she can paint it we don't
know who did those other nails she
probably just hired like a tiny talented
leprechaun to paint those other nails
and painted her own nails if messily on
camera truth is it's actually so hard to
film from this angles because when I
paint my nails there's little details
like this I literally paint them in my
face like my nails are actually in my
face and I'm painting them and I could
eat the paintbrush it's so close to me
but you can't do that when there's a
camera in between you because the camera
needs to see what you're doing
and I need to show all you great people
of the nail art world how I do these
nail work
I don't really know what this random
design is Musti some might say it's kind
of tribal looking I kind of think it
just looks like stairs yeah pretty much
stairs on a bright background so let's
add some more stairs okay I think I
should probably stop before I cover up
the whole neon gradient add a nice
glossy top coat to seal it all in well
you could use a matte top here whatever
does really matter whatever you want and
then you look with it crazy freak with
the craziest neon and st. nails on your
hand which is totally office appropriate
it's a wonder that these nail polishes
are called polish for tans damn I look
tan and like let's be honest I'm like
super pale in real life so on that note
these nail polishes make you tinge
yeah who needs a tanning booth when you
got neon polish all right guys I'm gonna
go back to sleep or watch house of cards
or something so thanks for putting up
with me sounding like a sexy dirty old
man see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
