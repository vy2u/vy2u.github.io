me christine and i hope you all had a
Merry Merry Christmas / happy holidays
and now it's time to do New Year's nails
why are there so many holidays this time
of year I'm exhausted
but I did these nails for New Year's
anyways because the people need their
videos and these are supposed to be
fireworks but I fully realized that they
look like flowers or me colourful squid
oh well let's do this anyways cuz you
know I'm all about a black rice black
rice no kala maybe if I sing this
tutorial will actually be a good one
because the nail art that I end up doing
isn't all that great I mean I know how
much you guys love my voice and think
I'm an amazing singer so I might as well
take advantage of that oh my god look at
the fruity flakies this is what unicorn
skin in the bottle how did I not realise
that yet
translucent flakies are in fact unicorn
skin bottled up with liquid so I'm going
to use two different types of
translucent flakies and they're also
color shipped in flakies because look at
that color shifter goes from green to
blue and oh my god it's so fantastical
magical and just slide those unicorn
skin soaked in bodily excrement right on
your nail here's the second type of
unicorn skins and we use it's like the
cousin of the green to blue unicorn skin
but this one is more rainbow I think
it's actually a mix of the green and
blue flakies with some orange e and gold
fun I don't know I can't tell is this
amazing I can't speak anymore now that
looks like actual gold flakes
from a goldmine now I say and she a
gold-digger the team messing with no
broke unicorns now I'm adding a matte
topcoat because I really wanted to bring
out the majestic color shifting amazing
qualities of the unicorn skins a matte
topcoat will make this look less shiny
well obviously Christine what I really
mean is that because it's not shiny
anymore you see the full flaky in high
definition like you can see its edges
and everything because there's no hard
light reflecting off any glossy surface
and now let's paint some fireworks or
try to I'm using my favorite white
polish to start as a base because
fireworks are white or at least they're
bright I take a tiny nail art brush and
I start practicing on a white yogurt lid
obviously you can really see what I'm
doing here this is a great tutorial
there's really no point in practicing
okay I know I'm not gonna get any better
at freehand especially at these really
challenging angles whenever I have to
film something it's always worst at this
point I'll be honest I had no plan at
all I was like I'm just gonna draw some
fireworks on these flakies because that
makes so much sense and then I was like
shit these fireworks are boring because
they have no colors so time to bring out
the hollow this is one of a few
different nail polishes that I used to
color in these quote-unquote
fireworks and I just kind of like one
for it let's add some dark blue because
they still look like poo then I thought
to myself okay these blues are boring me
let's add some bright neon pink to spice
things up a little and it was around
this point that I started realizing that
these fireworks do not look like
fireworks they look like flowers or
something very colorful from a notion
that I've never been to so let's try and
save it with more colors on the
Christene your brain is working so good
today I don't even know how to fix it so
I just add some silver Hall of glitter
in the middle of the fireworks because
what the fuck else am I gonna do to fix
this and yep here's my nails did I
mention that they ran the Color Run and
placed third so yeah it just looks like
a bunch of colorful vomit of holo and
sparkles and flakies in matte and shiny
and yeah there's so much shit going on
here I'm fully aware of this it's fine
let's gloss it all up just for fun this
is actually making it look a lot better
yeah I like it cuz baby yeah okay I'm
not even gonna try that y'all know I
can't sing high notes anyways the glossy
top coat definitely gives the flakies a
certain amount of depth to them and it
really makes you believe that they are
truly part of the sky and that the
colorful flowery throw-up things are in
fact fireworks right right right right
okay I'm gonna stop convincing myself
now and not pass these off for something
I really love but hey maybe you love
them I don't know truth be told if you
like the design idea that I've done here
you can use the same idea but just if
you know how to freehand paint by chance
that probably really helped you a lot
and your fireworks may actually look
like fireworks alright I'm off to make
my next video which isn't gonna be a
nail tutorial but it's gonna be like
hundreds of nail tutorials all together
that's right I'm gonna make a reacting
to old nail videos that I've done over
the past year as some kind of happy new
year my nail art be better of next year
until then see y'all next time bah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
