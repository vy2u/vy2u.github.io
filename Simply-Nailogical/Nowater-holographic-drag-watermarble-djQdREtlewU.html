once again check out these marble nails
that I made using no water at all and
it's all black and Hollow so you know
it's me being true to myself
today's mani is 75% simply illogical and
25% trying to be a Russian what is with
me lately and only applying black
colored face coats and not white wear of
the good old white days gone that was
not intended to be racist whatsoever
please do not get offended or judge me
based on what color I decide to pay my
nails I'm using a whole bunch of rainbow
colored Hallows hollow equals
holographic for everyone who's new to
class today these color club hollows are
like the staple awesome but cheap
hollows that everyone needs in their
nail polish collection and lucky for you
guys my favorite online nail store
recently restocked all these color Club
hollows find them at the link below in
the video description box yeah there's
so much useful information down there so
before I got started I did a bunch of
weird on this ziplock bag clearly I
felt the need to test this technique
repeatedly before doing it on my nails
because as we all know I'm not Russian
actually I'm Canadian but by being
Canadian that probably means I'm part
Russian along with part everything else
in the world and whatever I don't even
know anymore and then I take my shitty
black polish which I discovered in this
video could be used to imitate Russian
magic witchcraft I apply it on both
sides of the nail and then blob on the
hollows down the middle because I was
trying to go for a semi rainbow hollow
look
yeah don't do your Bob so big though or
else it'll just overtake your nail like
this well might as well try to play well
we're here quick act fast don't let it
drag grab some thin paint brushes I use
these ones from twinkle teeth on yeah it
just looks like unicorn threw up on my
nail it's not terrible but it definitely
does not heat Russian standards actually
it's pretty terrible let's try this
again it always feels so weird like
applying such massive coats nail polish
to your nail because this is not what
they taught us in school guys like
you're not supposed to apply a huge
balls of nail polish that makes no sense
it's all about thin layers what am I
saying they didn't teach us anything
about nails in school what up with that
curriculum this does look kind of cool
kind of like a hollow fire but it's not
exactly the effect I was going for and
what effect was I going for good
question let's try reversing the order I
blob things onto my nail I start out
with the hollows down the center of the
nail and then slather on the black crap
last
and she is not happy with these nails ah
this is still warmup time guys let's try
this on my pinky I didn't do the blocks
too big checkmark for me yeah this is
kind of the look I was going for where
the black looks like it's fading and
bleeding into the hollow like a sunburst
of hollow now let's see if I can
replicate that effect oh no my other
nails not likely but I try have you guys
seen any other nail or channel that
actually shows you how many takes it
took them to get the thing that ended up
on their actual nails that they show you
pictures because I haven't like what is
with that like we suffer just like you
guys do what good does that do seriously
here you all are suffering because you
have to redo it 22 times to make it look
like the picture meanwhile we also did
it 22 times I feel like we should suffer
together
let me just peel this off in order to do
this so many times without pulling my
hair out I like to use a peel-off base
coat this is my favorite one you can see
it in action in this video and soon I
will release a peel off base base off
video stay tuned and remember that I
have a full-time job that's not YouTube
yeah you can find the length of the peel
off stuff I use for now down in the
video description box I use it all the
time because I make a whole bunch of
mistakes like a normal person and at
this point how many times have I tried
to do this like seven times and I'm
still trying to achieve an effect that
I'm not really sure what I'm trying to
achieve BAM I think at this point I'm
just gonna go with whatever happens on
my nail oh yeah this is totally the
pattern exactly as I envisioned it
and that looks fine to me I'm done I use
my new clean up brush from twinkle to
look at it look at that flex so pretty
guys like a horse's hair dip it in a
little bit of acetone and clean up
around my cuticle you can grab them
yourself with my codes simply for 10%
off my code will give you magical
Russian powers but you might have to do
your nails 22 times to unlock those
powers yep this one looks perfectly fine
to me too okay this is the middle nail
this is where goes down this is the
star tutorial nail and I've already
messed her up because the purple blobs
have covered the blue blobs and that's
no longer rainbow let's try and see if I
can save this can I save you please let
me save you I really don't want to redo
you please I'm so tired of this it can't
be Russian oh no I can't do it that's
the like perfectionist in all nail
artists you just can't leave something
that looks so ugly as you can see I'm
still cleaning it up outta denial
because in my head I'm thinking no no
it's fine it's definitely fine right
like you can't even tell the difference
between this and the other nails I can't
stand it I'm redoing it anyways okay
blobs are on there pretty evenly spaced
sort of the black shits on the side and
now beginning to swipe and this is the
last time I do these stupid
nails and I'm like Adam shaking I'm so
nervous okay it looks fine
that's it we're done that's it be and
clean up brush thank you for getting me
a nice finishing touch whoo okay yeah
well you could just call this one luck
before you add a topcoat to any dry
marble man you gotta let it dry for a
long time I'm talking like 15 minutes
otherwise we're going to drag all that
marble action around and it's just gonna
marble the marble which sounds like it
would be a good idea but it's usually
not so don't do that I added a glossy
top coat to bring up the holo sparkles
and that's me pretending to be Russian
when people asked me this week at work
what is on your nails I told them I
honestly have no idea but I tried it 22
times
then they tell me to go back to writing
my report which is nothing to do with
nails okay well I hope you enjoyed yet
another truthful account of simply
illogical who is an actual real-life
person on this earth whose name is
Christine attempts at doing her nails
you're human I'm a human to you real
people next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
