can't do anything with my lips though I
cannot I cannot talk I will ruin it and
you thought this was a nail art channel
hello everyone it's me Christine again
the nail girl some time ago I did a
makeup tutorial and you guys liked it
which was weird because the whole thing
was meant to be a joke due to popular
demand I've decided to bring back simply
face logical because I got a face might
as well use it you know what they say if
you've got a face flaunt it is that what
they say that's not what they say if
you're new here and you like stupid
you should subscribe because I got a lot
of that ok let's begin this is my face
without makeup after my last makeup
tutorial I was left wondering is there
such a thing as hollow makeup and guess
what I found a little oh my god ok this
lighting is terrible you can't see
it's like blue and then it's like pink
and I also got this one it's like a
pinkish version first I think I should
probably do the rest of my face and do
the lips last to make it like perfect
and then take pictures and that's
like the order of beauty people do this
in write my name is simply face logical
don't with me why is there like glitter
on my forehead where did that even come
from there's no way glitter can look bad
so or I do my face though I think I
should use some of this exfoliating
stuff this stuff to exfoliate my huge
lips yeah how do people like not eat
this
all right so since I've already given
you guys a makeup tutorial and you
should know exactly how to do your face
this simply face logical way I'm just
going to speed through my face part so
we can get right on to the lips alright
so next is supposed to be foundation but
I don't like wearing that so I'm
just not going to do it
powders all over my shirt man now is
when I suppose I should put some on
my eyes but let's talk and more makeup
right you're here to learn and hair
literally don't know how to blend any
better than this
ah Nicky would be so disappointed in me
it's a good thing this isn't an eye
makeup tutorial it's pottery in here
twice one blue and ones like green with
the same eyeshadow like 7 hours oh yay
thank you we're just gonna put the
makeup back under here how did this
happen to me
shit's on the camera while I'm doing
this I should tell you about my second
channel don't have any expectations I
started it for a random that
doesn't really make sense to put on this
channel things that don't have to do
with nails come to think of it why am I
putting this video on my main channel
anyways it's basically for anything I do
and record that is simply not logical
but um it'll be like den and fills arts
and crafts channel where they upload
like once a year subscribe to it please
oh you snatch it he's so snatchy girl
what the does snatched even mean
don't forget this alright let's put
some eyelashes on cuz I don't have any
on my face already
which eyeball is this okay this is the
right here goes nothing mmm oh I don't
know how anyone wears these they are so
pink Master am I supposed to do this I
can this is the only eye I can see out
of
all right now that my eyes are beautiful
and complete it's time for what you all
came here for the hollow lip tutorial
yes so let me explain my thinking to you
first in case it doesn't work out then
you will know what I wanted to do so you
know how in nail polish hland we might
do like a black creme polish and then a
hollow topcoat on top of that and then
it really makes the Hollow pop versus if
you just put hollow over top of your
bare nail or like a light nudie color it
wouldn't really show up that much so I
thought what if I did like basically
black lifts and then put the hollow
on top of that I just realized I don't
have lip liner that's black or dark but
that's what eyeliner is for right yeah
so scary oh very good eyeliner and lip
liner are the same thing right you just
use different names for marketing it's
really hard when you don't have much to
trace now I'm just gonna go in with some
dark purple this is a nail channel I
don't know anything I know nothing okay
that is like totally not right and I'm
gonna blame it on looking at the mirror
like sideways so let me just do it
properly
alright so I might have over drawn my
lips just just a bit
I blame social media for that one hello
I'm a clown a dead one now that that's
done let's put some holo on this and see
if I was right alright here here goes
nothing
uh-huh that's kind of cool how friggin
cool would it be if that lip artist with
the lip drips the lip porn Vlad Vlad
mwah Vlad mwah
if she did holographic lips with the
drip at the bottom that would be sick
look at me go with my makeup tre I'm so
professional
whoa that turned like yellow that is so
cool it's like an oil spill Oh guys
bitch oh no I can't touch our list
together oh how do they do it we've got
to take a picture you got a bigger
picture clerk but I think this is
so cool oh my god I should do a hundred
layers of this huh not I didn't mean for
it to go that far it looks like I ate a
radioactive mermaid so in summary I
think this looks pretty cool look it
with all the light shifting ooh I'm so
scared I'm so scared there's still
powder up I know but I was gonna say is
this lip look shifts in the light you
look there it's like more indigo there
it's more green don't you wanna kiss me
okay I'm calling on you members of the
beauty community who can actually do
things properly on their face someone
else do this make it look good please so
I can totally see this look working for
like an everyday office look in fact I
think I'm gonna wear this to work
tomorrow it's good thing my boss is very
open so I thought this was gonna be a
hollow lip but it ended up looking more
like an oil spill mermaid lip which I
think it's equally cool I'm accepting of
all magical majestic creatures on my
face so subscribe to my channel see of
her great makeup to talk never also
subscribe to my second channel
I don't know what's gonna go on it yet
but you should subscribe anyways it's
