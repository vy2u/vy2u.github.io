I Christine again guess what I got in
the mail YouTube sent me this giant
thing nice and Suez ah Beng hey help me
oh there's a letter let's read it and
you're bigger than Vancouver bigger than
Las Vegas they like insulting my way 1
million subscribers we're incredibly
proud of all you've done so we hope that
you'll accept this gold play button
you're sincerely Susan watch Sikhi watch
psych hi would you
Jiki you can't say it either Susan
Wojcicki what Giggy thanks for the
ladder YouTube I'm sure you didn't send
the same one to other people now for the
unboxing Jesus Christ here you go
oh it's upside-down bigger than my face
gold play button is really nice I mean
like it's a step up from the silver one
obviously so shiny and reflective and
makes me feel like I've won an award for
doing stupid shit but you know what's
better than a gold play button
motherfucking hollow nail polish button
that's what now we must extract the
button how do you get in look the hooks
are actually at the back on the bottom
that's not right
so I'd have to hang it upside down we're
gonna have to perform surgery ah damn it
I don't want to have to do more work
YouTube already make so many quality
videos get the knives where is it even
hollow it feels like kind of solid in
places oh it's gonna be hollow
really scary really punch me in the face
but not by accident what there's no
turning back now whoa whoa whoa serial
killer it's perfect hey it works
okay I'm just kidding back the fuck up
now that's an allen key why didn't it
come with the allen key to remove it
like IKEA Hey vs. power tools where's my
head yeah let me in how did cutie pie
fixes remember his was broken it was
like this I will rescue you soon that
only they made it so you could play with
your play button it made this like
break-proof because they saw those
videos of people destroying them you
know what then do what you have to do
you're bleeding this is serious injury
YouTube is gonna do monetize my video
now okay I'm gonna go now okay oh hello
there oh yeah gold is better when it has
rainbows now we just go on a dam dam dam
to make the play button fab I just
realized this is gonna take forever
they call this the double dab now we've
got to cover up this 24k gold authority
plating save the middle for last like an
Oreo how about we fill it with some
black Hollow which yes they're being
beautiful now my play button has been
fully qualified but it's missing one
thing
oh yeah give me that glossy taco born I
could have just gone to the arts and
crafts store and bought some of that
clear gloss spray shit but that wouldn't
be nail-polish would it I think YouTube
should introduce an actual hollow play
button as a thought to start putting it
out there if you subscribe to this
channel you did this all we got left to
glossy taco is the black Hollow triangle
I hear it's as mysterious as the Bermuda
Triangle alright well it's still a
little wet but man this looks awesome my
wildest dreams have come true
I wonder if I just decrease the value of
this 24k gold-plated brick mm oh hell no
it's hollow but in case I did maybe you
can help me get a new one for my other
channel simply not logical
we're almost out 1 million subscribers
so go subscribe and help a girl out and
this time I won't cover it in nail
polish why am i holding this like I'm
gonna serve you a drink this could be
like a workout Jesus Christ how many
pounds is this tens Apollo would you
like some deviled eggs use it to
distract your teachers Oh shiny objects
you meant to give me an A+ look shiny
objects yeah I won the welterweight Ollo
championships you could play frisbee
with people you really hate I could have
just knocked with it and just left it in
the frame and hung it on the wall like a
degree that's so boring I would like to
give a big thank you to all of you guys
out there who subscribed to my channel
who supported my bullshit because
without you guys I would never have
gotten this button to play with also
probable interest to you guys we just
hit 3 million subscribers let them I
know it's been like a few several videos
since that happened but here I am now I
see literally just held my two million
subscriber giveaway you guys are just
too quick I can't keep up but on that
note I am gonna have a three million
subscriber giveaway next year but I
don't know what to do for it last time I
did a bunch of nail art tools and the
time before that I did a hundred bottles
of hollow nail polish so why don't you
guys let me know
what do you want write it in the comment
last time we had a little fun and
everyone who entered typed up a little
nail fail story and I kind of enjoyed
that because I like reading stewardship
but I also think you guys had fun doing
it and it wasn't just like click
Subscribe and enter because I want to
involve you and make you have fun and
whatever like really queer family I
would say I love you guys but I haven't
met
most of you and honestly that's like a
big set I like you guys a fin lot though

though man she does and because she's a
cat she loves things she's never met cuz
she's kind of stupid oh no no no no no
