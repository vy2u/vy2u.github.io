hello everyone it's me christine again
and i've got my friends here
yes i have read what we've got Sofia
from Sofia Nygaard yes and we've got
Corinne from Fred Bangor
I asked Rob to come but he gave me the
finger so since we're in New York we
don't have much time because everything
is very busy here so I figured it would
be fun to do our nails on the subway I
got a lot of materials here do you know
what these are
absolutely got some brushes oh I like
those little balls that's my favorite
big balls too so it looks like we've got
cats maple leaves stars mermaid scales
and kylie jenner's how advanced are
gonna make your nails in there I don't
know we're gonna go the bold carefully
package we must keep the nail-polish
safe that's the number one priority not
your own safety nail polish I hope we
don't get kicked off the subway but if
someone else asked to have their nails
painted I won't be mad are you gonna
paint them you know I charge five bucks
those we'll see
it's fiber they're advertising on the
subway it's not sponsored
where do they be wrong either way
it's a rat I always knew I was here
misson confirmed we're at the help
whoo you're touching every surface of
cards Universidad subscribe
you gotta dance go a good dance going
dollar bill mounting the polls early
I didn't peel off my nails first I gotta
get naked you want to tell me do you
mind sighs he gets undressed back what
is this basin it's a feel out base okay
it's all about that thing keep those for
the hoarder bag
obviously I'm keeping them and now I'm
just gonna repurpose those and put them
on my fingers that's cheating
you do that I'll let you guys get
started though ready no no I don't know
what I'm doing it this was a nice bottom
glass well I'm telling you glass is the
secret to filing their names this is
beauty on the go in high school every
single day for the up sophomore year I
took like two trains to get to school
and I just do my entire makeup including
eyeliner on the train so you're an
expert
yes except for the fact that I don't
know how to feed mail mail so yellow get
off track they're actually kind of
orange this is harder than I expected
what I feel like I'm drunk
I'm gonna clench the basecoat bottle in
between my thighs these are old yoga
pants a time
okay it's still a sorry oh that made me
worse I was worse when it still let me
do actually this is harder
every time someone makes announcement I
always think it's like someone who's
gonna kick us off I know it always
happens but it's never that leaves their
problems today I find if you put less on
the brush it's a little easier to manage
when you start moving around oh I just
spoke too soon
what can I have what color would you
like I have many here on the subway we
have Christine simply selection of
hollows who also guess it's flat-out a
pretty good choice oh oh
maybe the cap came off and there's no
brush oh yeah look good at all what's
going on there I did it wrong guess what
I got what
for dabbing so over the stencils
Justin life gotta omega Twitter Gators
take some nail polish my voice is
we've got the vibrator
that focus others better it's okay if
it's out of focus because Paulo looks
better flirt anyways take your sponge
off we got a moment we've got a moment
I'm gonna use these laughs to balance
that's okay
to make my nail fab look at back Wow
like I've never done a better job in my
life I mean I certainly haven't you can
always do another color on your other
hand my other hand
oh the cemetery how do I use the
stencils because I want to do you have
the stencils yes they're in the dark
place
Sofia now we're gonna be like boys is
that bad looking pretty shitty this
isn't my best work
she's actually my best work you know
yeah
oh yeah Oh
what do you think about the simpler you
know about we would hit off a lot more
diesel it stopped in here nails I mean
if you watch my following her tutorial
video I think the answer is clearly no
thank you for your kind words I'm just
gonna use his leg here for some balance
you know that's where the magic happens
fan your leg my thigh
beautiful I just realized this is
another part of the challenge it's
actually like the NuvaRing although it's
not just the actionable oh no I can't
fix my hair my hair is everywhere the
next step is the glossy top yet Deb
I think I'm gonna try and paint a shape
on my nail I know it's risky but very
real Miller please don't crash Oh what
are you gonna draw it's Voldemort's nose
rudimentary emoji it's a domino think
I'm going to try and do like an edgy
black French tip oh yeah really charge
$5 what are you saying it's not worth it
what'd you do she's a victim of
premature field work okay I'm almost
ready for the Aussie table
no one else so I'm winning at that
you're putting out something this
to me
what did you feel would you like a
unicorn
yeah I'm so lost and behind and
everything's sad oh that's fun this
whole thing I just I was so excited for
the stencil and then it betrayed me and
then now here we are and it's not your
fault it's Kylie's ball oh it's my fault
I had betrayed you with the peel out
face come
excuse me I'm painting my nail that was
actually almost ready for the boxy taco
okay how about you I'm done you didn't
do your other hand
that's a betrayal I don't really buy
your rules like some quitting
sounds like someone's just trying to
minimize how bad a job they only do it
one-handed it's not even giving myself a
shot to redeem myself I'm just going
with it oh we got 12 stops let's just
like the overbuilt shoot everything
isn't sound around and we all die yeah I
will share my glossy top rated you and I
don't share with many people who only
close friends
tell me what you're gonna do you're
gonna drive my death wait
it actually worked pretty nicely dad
it's not even tacky anymore the works
try it the only thing not tacky here go
Sofia go oh I hit them on the way out
your middle finger painted what's up is
this quality content I had to put bread
banger in the title and that's how you
do your nails on the subway
you guys know how to pose it's Lily now
that is the sexiest thing I've ever seen
oh my nails are stuck together I'm still
confused why cringe look like she wasn't
on a subway
she was just her nails at home you know
what I think it is that my hands are
usually shaky so the shaking of the
subway helped me out this is not fair
comment down below if you've ever tried
to paint your nails on the subway I'd be
impressed if someone had done that I'm
gonna go make sure to check out the
videos we filmed on their channels we
ate a lot of food on Korean and Rob's
channel and we did science for your face
this channel we'll see how that is all
right I'll be red carpet ready yes
perfect thanks so much for watching I'll
see you later
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
