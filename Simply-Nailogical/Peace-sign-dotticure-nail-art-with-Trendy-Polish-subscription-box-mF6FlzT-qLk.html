name if you don't know so I got this
really cool idea in my mailbox and it's
a nail art starter kit pack thing that
you can make nail art with this is the
trendy polish bynum monthly nail polish
subscription box that's right it's like
when people used to subscribe to
magazines in the 1990s except now you
subscribe to youtube channels in boxes
full of nail polish stuff that come to
your door aren't you glad you're a
millenium child this nail tool kit
boxing is 24.95 a month but because I'm
a hustler I got you a discount
oh it thinks I'm beautiful use code
simply for five dollars off your first
box that means you pay 1995 for an over
$60 value of nail stuff this also
includes free shipping in the US um
let's just pretend that I didn't just
sound like an infomercial and that this
isn't QVC or the Shopping Channel
oh look the box is telling you what to
do next
we should probably pay attention you can
watch tiny polish ourselves nail our
tutorials on her YouTube channel and
then you'll have beautiful nails and
then you can share them online like the
only way you know how to share
information what do you know every
single thing in this box has a purpose
even the paper craft that my cat is now
playing with men G do not eat the paper
I don't want to see this in the litter
box you can get your own trendy polish
nail polish subscription box thing at
the shop link below or visit trendy
polish com where you can find even more
information on this box including how to
get it in your nail mail
okay that's enough Christine just show
us what the hell is in the box
okay nail polish and tools and oh my god
so much Stephanie throw it everywhere
neon pink nail polish ooh
royal blue cobalt neon blue whatever you
want to call it bright blue nail polish
we got some cute little essential minis
that's black white and clear topcoat
these three are actually a founder bonus
that are exclusively available in this
first box not the next box this box so
you got to get this box now before
November if you want these three things
few rolls of striping tape Yost a nail
prepping block thing file buff polish
and shine I don't do most of those
things but okay makeup sponges and
everyone knows we don't actually do our
makeup with these we do our nails
radiance of course doubting tools so
many dots to be made she got five tools
in each got two ends with different
sizes and five times two is ten which
means you got ten different sizes of
balls to make dots with yay for math so
remember this is just the first box and
it will change every month so you may
not get the same stuff if you order
after November but that makes it even
more exciting because you got different
things every month to do your nails in
different ways start out by prepping
your nails with that block thing yes my
nails are yellow and no it doesn't
matter better watch my other video on
yellow nails before you get all ignorant
on me and leave a stupid comment so I'm
starting with a white base and wow this
supply is quite nice and smooth and
silky this is a good cream yeah
cream not milk yeah I did use two coats
to make it fully opaque but I think
overall it's a really great white and it
applies very evenly and nicely on my
nail yay yay perfect and two easy codes
I'm applying a quick dry top coat now
Damo striking taping you don't want to
peel off that white bass do you oh my
god I hate this part
stupid striping tape struggle to
actually find the end of it oh holy
there's a marker where the end of it no
way you're kidding me right
this must be the twilight zone what are
you kidding me
did you actually just tease me like that
well at least you told me where the end
was so I only struggled half as much I
am slowly going crazy going crazy going
crazy cut a bunch of little pieces and
put them on the top of the nail polish
bottle so you can easily pick them up
after oh hello there I'm a wig from the
80s let's make a peace sign with this
striping tape just doing my nails puts
me at peace because I'm going to do a
gradient I'm applying my simply peel but
you can also use whatever liquid latex
you want around my finger to help
protect it from the gradient mess no
liquid latex is not in the trendy polish
subscription box but we can't have
everything we want in like Canada Wow
look at this pink guys it's so neon me
my camera doesn't not a handle it blue -
yeah these colors are so rich I love
them already so I'm gonna sponge the
gradient around in a circular fashion so
that it kind of looks like a round
gradient or radial gradient or a circle
gradient whatever you want to call it
always build up your gradient slowly
with thin light coats and don't get too
overexcited and put too much nail polish
on the sponge because it's not gonna
work out I promise you looks like I
forgot how to blend colors properly what
a great example you're putting on for
the world Kristine learn to quit before
you go too far and ruin everything now
I'm gonna peel up the simply peel and
the striping tape and clearly I didn't
think through the order in which I put
down a simply peel on the striping tape
did I phew that was close
use a cleanup brush to clean around the
edges
hanging around now we're gonna make some
dots because I feel like making things
complicated I just throw some of the
trendy polish black and white on a
yogurt lid and then use the dotting
tools to make some big black dots around
the peace sign thingy this black is
looking really good and opie yeah I like
it a lot
yes I'm intentionally making the black
dots really close to each other so it's
kind of going to be this overlapping dot
acure attached it made sense in my head
before I started okay don't judge if the
Polish is getting a bit stringy that's
probably because you're letting it dry
too much on the yogurt container lid
every now and then you should probably
clean off the top of the dotting tool
and start over to make it fresh and nice
I don't see any mistakes I don't know
what you're talking about now I'm gonna
take an even smaller dotting tool and
put white dots in the middle of the
black dots dots on dots on dots are
actually just dots on dogs don't mind me
just blocking the camera why do I rarely
do dot occurs this is so much fun I
should do it on my entire nail and cover
up that messy greedy and I did why are
you pointing that out to people
Christine when you're done cover your
entire nail in the glossy top coat that
came in your trendy polish box to avoid
bleeding the colors make sure you let it
dry for about 15 minutes before you put
on a top coat and you apply very gentle
pressure with the brush on the nail
that's right gentle girl feet gentle Wow
beautiful and now we can admire my
gradient inconsistencies all right well
these are my nails

looks you can do with this subscription
