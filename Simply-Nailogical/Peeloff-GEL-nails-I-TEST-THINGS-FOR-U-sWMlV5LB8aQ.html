Christine again and I know my face is in
another nail tutorial it's getting kind
of weird there's a little too much face
going on in this channel I recently saw
a bunny from graveyard girl hello to all
my swamp family members do a video on a
device that was supposed to steam off
her gel nails and I cried and died on
the inside for her watching that piece
of shit ruin her nails so to be honest
I'm not really sure if it was the device
itself the gel polish itself the
application of the gel polish or
chipping away at it that made her nails
get eaten alive because I am NOT a nail
technician or any kind of licensed
professional in the nail field I just
have an entire channel about this thing
that I'm not qualified to talk about but
I thought that the situation was so
desperate that I wanted to save bunny
and help her find a better way to remove
those gel nails
first of all full disclosure I don't
wear gel nails ever will see because
they take forever to take off obviously
and if you haven't noticed I do my nails
a lot so I need to change them a lot and
gel polish is done when you're doing it
but I got an idea because we all know
how much I love my peel-off base coat
but because I'm kind of afraid of using
gel and it ruining my good hand and I
can't have that happen I'm gonna use it
on my other hand that no one sees and no
one hears about the reject hand you're
the reject I'm gonna risk your life
instead of yours let's get to it okay no
more face we're back to normal
let me introduce you to my right hand I
call her Cindy yes both my hands have
different nail shapes and lengths don't
hate respect the diversity I was also
wearing the peel off base coat under
this linear Hollow and I had it on for
an entire week yeah I know I mean it's
chipping around the corners but that's
kind of what you expect anyways let's
get to the actual point of this video
yes let's do that now thank you this is
the specimen we will be testing today I
put the link down below in the video
description box if you wish to check it
out I normally use just one coat but for
this experiment I'm going to use two
because I assume that gel polish will be
more difficult to get off than regular
I'm randomly using this gel polish that
I've never used in my life and we'll see
how it's gonna go
first of all gel applies really weird
and probably putting it on too thick
than you're supposed to because I read
online that you're supposed to do this
in very thin coats one at a time but I
don't care it's time to bake I'm just
using one of those cheap at home LED gel
nail dryer curing machines whoo I'm
Raven when the light turns off that
means I'm done I think and now it's time
to do a second coat just application is
boring let's listen to a short story
time funny story the first time I heard
about graveyard girl because I was so
clueless to the YouTube world before a
year ago was when I made my very first
scale gradient nails and I called them
alligator skill gradient
they were like green colors and everyone
started tagging graveyard girl on my
Instagram posts and I was like who the
fuck are you tagging like you're tagging
some girl in a graveyard like that's
creepy that's weird
I think I'm done but then I touch my
finger and it was all sticky why he's so
nasty gel polish and then I googled it
and found out that this is supposed to
happen weird so I'm just wiping off the
sticky shit with some alcohol ah perfect
I think so then I went about my day for
a day and a day later it was time to do
the peel test let's start with you thumb
to reduce the damage if the shit ruins
my nails then people care less about my
thumb on my opposite hand that yo ha
shit is actually working did you see
that pop replay replay replay
this is so satisfying I mean I love
peeling all things off my nail so gel I
mean it just bonds to itself like a
really hard but still soft and malleable
shell we open the door and we close the
door we open the door we close the door
so yeah in conclusion this peel-off base
coat works amazing with gel polish at
least after 24 hours I'm still annoyed
I'm gonna have to clean under my nails
with acetone though so because I love
science and I want to show you guys real
empirical evidence I'm gonna redo the
test but leave it on for seven days only
time will tell time will prove science
let's just show you me applying this
again because it's so fun to do after
last time I think I learned that you
have to wrap the tip of the nail with
the peel off base coat too
so definitely wrap the tip ladies wrap -
oh I see my exam I really decided to
come out and say hi today protection
layer locked in so I'm gonna try a
different color this time I'm gonna go
for a teal ish color cuz it matches not
my shirt but my sweatpants oh shit
I just realized this isn't the gel
polish this is the writing job Christine
I was wondering why it was so easy to
apply yes lovely shit I love this shit
check it up
check check check check check it out
you're supposed to shake gel polish now
remember Christine very thin coats you
have to at least appear like you know
what you're doing people expect more
from this channel don't worry I won't
forget
about you coaxing your nail alright bake
me yeah well you're not gonna get like a
close-up view of this time because
that's just so complicated so many
camera angles how many cameras do you
think I have what we have slipped into
the portal now looks like my nails are
in a tanning bed wonder if my nails are
gonna get cancer ah just kidding I don't
mean to cause a moral panic we're all
gonna die of something one day if you
didn't know that
okay we're dying code number two did it
again by the way is anyone jealous of my
opposite hand painting school
fake Mullica baked like when I had an
easy bake oven except I can't eat my
nails am i beautiful yet I would love
for the Magic School Bus to take a ride
inside of a bottle of nail polish
special still even running would have to
be a trip in a bottle of holographic
nail polish though because a trip in any
other time would be just boring and you
would learn absolutely nothing alright
it's Taco Time got the hiccups this
should go well it's painted your
opposite hand and having the hiccup
isn't a challenge don't know what is
slowly carefully oh who cares it's the
pink pinky
hey last now we can do this I'm gonna
try and show you here that I got it in
my cuticles I don't know if that's gonna
make this experiment better or worse
pick up off this tick and take away my
hiccups like dad's burning my Zima all
right cool I'll see you in seven days
bye
well yep don't really understand cuz I
wasn't even doing anything like crazy
was scratching any people but if you
look closely you see at the bottom how
its kind of like sticking out there kind
of have a feeling that that was the
point of weakness that made this nail
peel off I'm just gonna redo that one Oh
see look I did the same thing on this
nail be I should just preemptively take
it off and put it back on properly up
it'll just take them all off my
experiments already ruined so much fun
to feel though okay this time I'm gonna
really clean my nail beds properly it's
probably better if I don't tackle up
trying to concentrate I really don't
want to buff my nails but the gel people
told me to washing my hands oh I hate
water cleaning your nails with alcohol
is weird I thought that belonged in your
mouth apparently your nails can't be wet
beau yes shake it shake a shake up shake
I like a gel makeup look at me go
guys I'm concentrating so hard right now
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
second coat top coat cancer coat get rid
of that sticky sticky this is gonna be
great I just realized I hate this color
okay so I think I did it better this
time around I'll see you in seven days
hopefully you have seven days
I'm back and I'm so happy to report that
this is still on my hands I gotta be
honest though I didn't really enjoy
wearing them for an entire week
because they're not hollow anyways let's
see if I can peel them off first I'm
just going to load up my nails with my
favorite nail oil to help soften it and
peel off the jelly here I just realized
it kind of looks like I'm taking out my
drugs like yes that's how I feel about
this anyway it's my crack okay let's
actually do this more you wash your
hands or get oil on your nails the
easier they're going to lift whether
it's Jill or regular polish because
that's just how the peel off base coat
works
peel off base coat is going to come off
quit her and normal nail polish you'd
think that would be obvious because it's
called a peel off base coat but a lot of
people ask me all the time I can't get
my peel off base coat to last more than
a week well yeah because the peel off
base coat is designed to make the Polish
come off easy so it doesn't make sense
that it would last for as long as normal
nail polish you want your nail polish to
come off earlier and easier or do you
want your nail polish to stay on longer
but you have to use regular nail polish
remover to take it off the choice is
yours but you can only have one oh yeah
now you see bread in there yeah my skin
is so dry I cursed you to winter curse
you okay we ready you ready you ready oh
I'm so ready I'm so ready for this
gallon everywhere I found a nice spot
peel you oh yeah oh my god okay so the
root beer float turned into a cherry
float and now my nails are pick um I
guess I now I need to make a video on
why pink nails don't matter I guess it's
that the brown pigment in this gel
polish is very pigmented good use of
words Christine oh well I mean I don't
discriminate against any color of
strained nails really the quality for
all pink nails matter so do yellow nails
okay let's see if I can get you off it
seems to be a little trickier oh there
we go
ah so just to be clear the reason why my
nails are pink is not the peel off base
coat because the peel off base coat is
clear and it has no coloring in it I
thought it is possible that the peel off
base coat isn't really a stain protector
something to do with the formula I guess
but I'm still pretty happy with how this
gel polish peeled off after an entire
week holy shit that was even more pink
honestly it's just some nail polishes
staying more than others and you don't
really know until they stain you look it
looks like I have nail polish on like my
nails are blushing it's cuz they're
naked so they're shy I don't kind of
doing my nails today
just kidding I'm gonna put Hollow on
them cuz I'm so bored right now it's
kind of weird how it only stains some
sections of the nail away so even though
the gel did peel off the nails semi
sounds so weird to random people though
I'm just gonna peel off my nails the job
isn't completely done because
you see there's still bits of Dell on
the underside of my nail I'm gonna have
to use acetone or something to remove
that move over all thoughts and
conclusions you can use at least this
peel-off base coat with gel nail polish
but it will probably come off too fast
if you apply it the wrong way like I did
the first time a peel off base coat can
last with gel polish for up to weeks not
testing it for longer than that but you
probably still have to be careful about
how you applied it and seal the edges
and didn't get too much gel polish all
up in your cuticle or too much peel off
a scuff air I definitely still have not
mastered the application of gel polish
but who said this was a nail polish
channel as far as I can see from my free
tests using a peel off base coat may
actually reduce damage to removing gel
polish because you don't have to jab it
your nail and chip it it away to get the
polish off that is what partly leads to
damaging your natural nail and I'll
start hacking away at it like a serial
killer
as always at the link down below to this
crack that I use all the time I use it
under my nail art designs too so I can
peel them up and save them now it's that
time again when we killed off our nails
we're gonna add them to the Paley bag
got my pills on in you these represent
all the journeys and trips I have taken
in my life back in there feel like I
could sell this on eBay for a stupid
amount of money simply no logical peoe
bag 100 right here $100 $110 nerdo
$1,000 $3,000 for all my victims
alright so please subscribe to my
channel because I asked you so nicely
and thanks so much for watching me and
my pink nails we'll see y'all later Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
