and a long long time ago I posted this
video where I did a what's the best pili
shit for around your nails fun fact it
was actually the second video that I
ever did a voiceover for and I didn't
even introduce myself correctly hey
everyone it's May
it's May good job Christine good job for
getting everyone to question your actual
name in any case I made that video over
a year ago and I linked the winner from
that video down below in the video
description box if you care but now some
time has passed and there's new shit on
the nail market but first in case you're
new and I have no idea what the hell
this shit is for anyways basically it
goes like this
you're really fucking like nail polish
so much that you want to put more than
one shade of polish on the same nail
like this in a gradient form where you
use a makeup sponge to dab the color on
and blend it but you don't want nail
polish on your skin no that's not where
it's supposed to go and it's a bitch to
take off back in the day I made these
videos look easy and the parts of you
struggling to get that shit off my skin
yeah I cut those out it was all a lie
the solution was to use liquid latex
around your skin do the dab dance and
then peel it right off and that's when
peel porn was born
don't ever use glue though in place of
liquid latex because the peel porn is so
bad but some of you guys have mentioned
that you have latex allergies which
means that you can't use liquid latex
yes that's what that means so I got
these new latex free sticky thingies
that peel off to try for you today I've
seen these around from a few companies
and I get the impression from seeing
other people's reviews that it's
basically all the same shit I put a link
down below in the video description box
for the ones that I'm using today all
right then let's get started shall we
as with most of my manicures I'm
starting off with a peel off base coat
and I'm gonna keep that porn to myself
for once because today we're gonna have
all sorts of other types of good
satisfying BOE porn when one overwhelm
you and on this now I'm gonna make a
holo gradient so I'm using some pink
holo first as a base as with all of my
videos you can find links to all the
shit I use down below in the video
description box that's what the
description box is for take a look at
this weird new product oh there's a
clear plastic thing on top you should
peel that off first up close it looks
like a band-aid or a nose pore strip
maybe who wants a facial so it's kind of
rubbery and flexible and the bottom is a
bit sticky but not overly sticky like
masking tape or anything so basically I
guess what you're supposed to do is just
peel it off all this can be so much peel
part in this video I can't wait and I
found pulling it over your nail like
this was best so that you don't muck up
the nail polish you already put on your
nail I found it was easiest to use some
tweezers and pull and adjust the nail
pili things with the fall is cold again
I'm just gonna call them nail aprons oh
how about nail art aprons
never mind the world doesn't understand
me unlike the liquid latex is you don't
gotta wait for these nail aprons to dry
because they already dry I'm just gonna
take
make up sponge and put on those
beautiful hollows I'm going to blend on
to my nail why I am British all the
sudden I don't know why just insulted
British people by saying this was their
accent I also don't know so now we are
dab dab dab on the nail
speaking of dabbing have you seen my
greatest hollow hits tracks uploaded to
my second channel simply not logical
it's a party for your ears keep on
dabbing until you're happy with the
opacity and blending of the nail
polishes and now the moment of truth
we've gonna peel it off
that was one unedited clip ladies and
gentlemen unedited there's a tiny bit
left over that I'm gonna have to use a
cleanup brush with a bit of acetone to
get off my skin but you know what it's
not quite different than the norm of
using liquid latex almost every time I
use liquid latex there's always a little
bit left on your skin similar it just
slips in there that's why they say
condoms prevent pregnancy only 98% of
the time and you should have another
form of backup protection whoops I'm
gonna get demonetised all right well
this is going so well let's do it again
on another nail is that a cat hair yes
it is
get out you little cat hair get out of
mine nail I can't get it up
so here's a reminder that these nail
apron thingies are sticky so try not to
put them on anything before you put them
on your finger or else they will be less
sticky and slipping on that apron again
like a bitch in the kitchen and
fast-forwarding this part obviously but
I wanted to show you that it did take me
some time to get it to stick in the
right position so far this is probably
the only downside in comparison to a
traditional liquid latex because you
can't really get as precise as you can
when you're painting the liquid latex on
to fit your actual finger and now we put
some different colored shit on the
sponge and dab dab dab to make your
nails look
and do a couple coats and now we're
ready to peel here we go oh oh that was
a fresh first peel hold on I got a pass
for the thumbnail oh yeah wow that was a
clean peel right there a very tiny bit
of cleanup left to do but hey that's
pretty good okay here we go again
because you haven't seen enough examples
I found I struggled a bit more to make
it stick right on nails that were a bit
wider like my middle finger and then you
just kind of jammed the sides of the
apron together behind your nail dab dab
dab and all that jazz and now it's time
to peel and so far this is the heaviest
amount of nail polish I've had on these
nail apron peel ease and yeah it works
fine to me pretty much no different than
how it would work with a regular liquid
latex as a general rule of thumb though
rule of thumb the more skilled you are
at placing the nail apron pili thingy on
the skin of your nail the last cleanup
you will have to do after you peel it
off now let's try it with some glitter
sponging for whatever reason I decided
to put the apron on first and then put
the first coat of nail polish oh yeah
give me that black hollow witch
hollow glitter on a sponge oh yeah these
are my evil dreams come to life dab dab
dab new hollow sexual fab and I probably
sponge done way too much cutter than I
needed to can't help it I get carried
away I'll peel it off and yeah some shit
went under the apron but what can you do
now that we're done let's add some
glossy taco because you can't complete a
nail video without seeing this it's so
satisfying again again and then I swear
I'm gonna answer some of your questions
let's put a matte taco on this one
because why not it's summer actually no
it's now that summers done and one last
glossy taco for the win one question you
probably have is are these apron
thingies reusable because we're all
cheap assholes and want to milk things
as much as we can
I tried it out and I
seen a few other people try it as well
and I think the bottom line answer is
yes and no if you manage to peel it off
after using it and not having it stick
to itself or crumple up into a little
ball then you may be able to use it
again put it around your nail for a
second round but as with most sticky
things it will have already started to
lose it stick from using it the first
time so it may not stick as well on the
second go and I found that the more you
made the apron wet with nail polish the
more it kind of got all warped all the
tugging to adjust it around your nail
probably doesn't help either and so I
guess these are really just like condoms
you could reuse it if you were broke
desperate and very careful not hard on
it the first time you put it to you some
more times you use it the more wear and
tear it gets if you know what I'm lame
and then it's just less effective it
just doesn't work and well and you want
to protect your nails right your nails
matter the most here and this analogy
okay that's what I'm trying to say so in
summary here's some reasons why you
might want the nail apron Keeley's over
the liquid latex its latex free so if
you're allergic this is your best option
for peely shit there is ZERO drying time
it has no smell at all
there is no clumping up or hardening
because it's not like a liquid in a
bottle or anything it is not sticky on
the upper side of the apron so your
fingers won't stick together and it may
be reusable but not really I'd say don't
really count on that and if you're not
allergic to latex here are some reasons
why you might prefer the traditional
liquid latex over the pili aprons the
drying time is super short it's like 1
to 2 minutes it's barely waiting because
it's a liquid you apply with the brush
you got control and you can get right in
there on the cuticles it has a really
heavy stick to the skin when you apply
it on and it's not going to accidentally
peel up like the aprons did you can use
it on your actual nail and other kinds
of nail art like if you're doing a
scaled gradient or a French tip and
finally for all the broke motherfucker
out there a liquid latex would be
cheaper for use than the peel-off apron
thingies so with all that said
it's best for you you do you you now you
you nail yourself okay that's just
getting weird thanks so much for
