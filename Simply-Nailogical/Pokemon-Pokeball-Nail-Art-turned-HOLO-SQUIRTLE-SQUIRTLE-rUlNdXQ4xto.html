again thanks for all the love on my last
video the Donald Trump nail art tutorial
and today I've got some holo Pokemon
nails for you in hopes that all the holo
sexuals will Pokemon go subscribe to my
channel guess what guys today's video is
a collab and yeah if you're thinking of
the kind of video where you didn't
actually do anything together to make it
a club yeah that's what I mean but sandy
from cutepolish and I actually both
wanted to do Pokemon nails and I was
like sandy I think we're gonna need to
make this video a collab because I know
all about Pokemon so make sure you go
watch Sandy's video and subscribe to the
cute polish channel because she'll
probably say things about Pokemon that
make sense unlike me first we're gonna
start off with a base coat to protect
your natural nail just kidding i'm
applying a peel-off base coat because
i'm gonna give you some real polka peel
porn at the end of this video
next i'm going to add white polish as a
base color because I googled Pokemon and
the balls are apparently white at the
bottom getting use lots of colors
because I am a rebel now I'm aware that
the traditional poker ball is red black
and white like this so I'll keep with
the tradition I will just for this one
nail and I'm gonna make it better by
making it Hollow and if you know me you
know that there is no way in hell I am
freehanding any stripes so I'm just
gonna make myself some stripe decals by
putting nail vinyls on a nail art mat
and doing what you're seeing yay good
for me for explaining things while I let
those stripes dry I'm also gonna make
some little black balls wow that that
sounds weird
that's like blue balls but we're seal
off the vinyl
and I decided to make some more circle
ball things because I didn't know what
size I needed yet while we're at it
let's make some hollow balls so I just
fun John some silver hollow glitter
he'll the vinyl off and let all that
stuff dry once your stripes are dry you
can peel them up very carefully then I'm
just gonna add some clear nail polish to
the middle of my mail and use it to
stick on the black line it's like a belt
it's the Pokemon belt that's that's what
this is right it's got to keep your
pants up when you're running on the go
pokemon go
peel yourself up a perfect black dot add
some clear polish to the back gently
press it down on your nail and well fuck
me that D didn't work because I waited
too long and the clear coat melted the
black ball thing so here's another one
that I'm just gonna cover that up with
yes and then have her happened the
hollow is dry the hollow his dry this
one applied a lot better because it was
thicker like a glitter sticker hey that
rhymed huh press down your hollow
pokeball add a glossy taco and bam
you've unlocked the Polka powers of the
Pikachu
Charmander things or it else or it'll
squirtle no I don't know what that is
but it's sure fun to say now let's make
some more pokeballs also hollow and also
I'm not sure if these actually exist in
Pokemon but I googled Pokemon colored
balls and other versions came up all the
pokemon experts are cringing right now
this one kind of looks like a banana
Ben's banana vinyls anyone for this now
I wanted it to be a little more badass
imposable so I added some black polish
to the tip of my nail and I'm gonna put
some black hollow witch on top of it oh
my god the hollow porn someone pocus
stopped me
then we gonna dab dab dab that black
Holloway it's right on to the nail black
hollow which is one of my hollow
glitters did you know that and now we're
gonna peel that banana looking thing up
and I'm not really sure what the hell I
was trying to do here but one thing I do
know for sure is that there was no way I
was gonna freehand some lines on my
nails so I whipped this shit together
and let's just pretend it looks like
that pokeball okay just pretend and now
you're gonna seal in your design and add
a beautiful shine I mean out of glossy
taco bring out that Hollow bitch now
let's do my other nails yay this is so
much fun you know what's really crazy
that I recently learned on my Twitter
that apparently there's a Pokemon named
Menchu someone tweeted this to me
and then someone also tweeted this one
to me and then someone even tweeted
Zeiler Pokemon to me and there's like a
few different sylars in the game
honestly I'm so impressed
I almost want to start playing the game
just so I can catch my cat you know who
does play pokemon go is my boyfriend Ben
get it get it get it girl there's a
Pokemon at work
kill her kill that bitch
go do my job for me where is it it's in
my shirt
you get off me crab he's pretty good at
it okay let's do the pinky this nails on
the blue polka team and it's gonna get a
nice red stripe first I'll chop it up
make it sticky and then attempt to put
it on my nail in the way that it is
presented in this particular image it's
not perfect but I always hated
parallelograms and here's the thumb I
didn't film it but I used the same nail
vinyl make a sticker technique to cheat
up making the lines I've always wondered
what happens when you push the polka
button like if I were to press on my
little hollow buttons what what's gonna
happen like the world is gonna explode
with Hollow that'd be great actually I
apologize if you're a big Pokemon go fan
that I haven't personally gotten into
the game but you're probably better off
with me not getting obsessed with it
because then I would have no time to
make videos for you guys I also
sometimes get really frustrated at games
that I can't beat speaking of those it's
like unpolished blast I swear I've been
stuck on level 175 for like two years
well the game hasn't been out for two
years but whatever okay my point is
still the same this level is rigged
sandy this level is rigged stop giving
me the goddamn face I quit it just makes
me too angry you know what makes me feel
better though it's hollow haha I just
want to say quickly for some people out
there who don't understand my sense of
humor I like sandy she's really nice
she's also really funny when you get to
nowhere
sometimes people would compare me and
cutepolish and i don't understand why
it's got to be like that one doesn't
have to be better than the other you're
allowed to like both of us and any other
nail artist for that matter now go to
cue polishes video and show her some
hollow love in the comments the Internet
should really be a fun place don't go
spreading hate guys spread fun also
spread love if you like that bullshit e+
shit holy shit Christine you were
talking and being so annoying and we
forgot to mention that I added a hollow
taco I'm sorry I couldn't help myself as
if your nails weren't hollow enough
Christine as if they weren't hollow
enough and now it's time for that polka
peel porn I promised you mm yeah I love
taking these balls right off my nails
they were a little wet so they struggled
coming off super cleanly but they came
off smooth nonetheless mmm
let's peel the other ones off too oh
yeah that's the stuff
gotta peel them all
alright guys thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
