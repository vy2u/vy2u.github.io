but I just had to rant on today about
how frustrating it is that you have 8
million white nail polishes and yet none
of them are opaque enough perfect in
four easy coats no I don't think so
not when I got a nail art to do don't
worry I found an easy trick and you
don't even have to hunt down one elusive
white nail polish just buy white polish
meant for French tips I haven't tested
all french tip white nail polishes
because that would probably take me like
twice as long as my latex review video
and I just can't I just can't guys it
takes talent I can't do it but I know
for sure that this color Club polish
French tip hey what do you know it's
called french tip definitely works so
usually my issue with white nail polish
is that they're just way too thin like
this one on the left by color club
called blank canvas yeah this is like no
I'm not going to put four coats of milk
on my nails just to make them white but
the problem is with french tip nail
polishes usually the brush and a lot
thinner then that brands regular nail
polish size brush which is the case with
color Club Orly and a couple others
to solve this problem you want a big
nice thick brush to apply nail polish
like a normal person and you're going to
need another white polish by the same
company a regular polish and just switch
the brush so I swapped the brush from
the French tip polish to the crappy
white nail polish that's like milk and
bam I have a French tip nail polish
consistency with a regular sized brush
oh my god I know what an amazing
discovery tell your friends tell your
kids tell your mom tell your neighbors
tell everybody cuz he just got a switch
a brush sometimes french tip nail polish
can be a lot thicker and if it gets too
thick then it's not really that easy to
spread on the nail so just add a couple
drops of nail polish thinner not 100%
acetone go out and actually buy nail
polish thinner from your local beauty or
netballer store and add a couple drops I
think I just added five or so shake it
and then test it out okay that's all I
had to say today back to the star of the
show which is the pretty pink leopard
nails oh my god that's so pretty cuz
they're pink and they've got leopard
that's like purple and pink leopard
which doesn't exist in a leopard in real
life but it's pink and girly so it's so
cute like oh my god you totally gotta do
this on your friends and your next
number part
ha
haha
by the way I actually hate pink leopard
and it's April Bolton</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
