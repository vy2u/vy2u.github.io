nail glitter and the other was done with
cake-decorating glitter can you spot the
difference neither can i well hello
everyone it's me christine again and
last week on simply illogical we
attempted to recreate the viral
instagram-worthy
diamond cappuccino currently being sold
in Mumbai India by coffee by de Bella
now the coffee shop claims to be using
an edible mixture of crystal sugar and
food coloring to make the drink Sparkle
but we couldn't help but notice that the
glitter they're using looks incredibly
similar to the food contact safe but not
edible glitter known as disco dust that
we use to make our own version it's
essentially little pieces of plastic
which is why it's not technically edible
or ideal for digestion by the human body
and so we were pretty skeptical when we
read that the coffee shop claimed it was
just sugar and food coloring because at
least from our research there is no
sugar in food coloring that looks like
holographic plastic pieces of glitter
but maybe we were wrong because I can't
order a Diamond cappuccino all the way
from Canada it's pretty far so I asked
you guys for help I have a mission for
any hollow sexuals out in Mumbai India
go to a coffee buy develop but go
undercover don't tell them I needed you
guys to help me figure out what the hell
was actually in this goddamn coffee and
the hollow sexuals in Mumbai came
through if you follow me on Twitter you
will have seen me share some of the
evidence exhibits there were some
photographic evidence we got some
Instagram videos too
and even some YouTube videos where the
barista literally made the drink in
front of you
and now I would like to present the most
damning evidence in the court of simply
Oh
Oh
also when I tasted it I expected it to
be sweet but it wasn't very much like
eating sad and it also stuck to my lips
in the same manner that it did cements
them it does they give me stuff that
does not seem that it is what they say
it is overall it seems like this
evidence suggests that the glitter
doesn't behave like you would expect
sugar to I'll make sure to put links to
these sources down below so you can
assess the evidence and foal yourself
and - thank you guys for your very
important research we've reached out via
DM to deliver you some simply swag
because you deserve it you are on your
way to being fantastic detectives I'm
calling it now then Ben also wondered
what would happen if someone scooped
some of the glitter into a glass of
water what it dissolve or not you see if
you stir edible sugar in a glass of
water whether the water is hot or cold
it dissolves pretty easily and that's
because sugar breaks down in water just
like it does in your body don't mind the
red that's just food coloring but if you
stir disco dust in a glass of water
it just keeps spinning because it's
plastic and not water-soluble it looks
beautiful though oh you are entering the
hollow
it's also interesting is that after
stirring the glitter in cold water some
of it sinks but in hot water it mostly
floats on the surface kinda like it does
in that warm cappuccino men she is very
very suspicious
so then one of the dedicated hollow
sexuals from Mumbai took it upon herself
to answer Ben's question she saved the
hollow glitter from the diamond
cappuccino on a paper towel and then
dumped it into a glass of water in
stirred and get this it didn't dissolve
and we're now left with what looks
pretty damn similar to plastic hollow
glitter often referred to as disco dust
that is not edible
so in conclusion as much as I want
hollow beverages especially hollow tea
to exist this evidence is pretty
convincing to me and reaffirms that as
far as we can tell
truly edible hollow does not exist and
we can only decorate our food with it
but we can't eat it but because I have
all this fucking disco dust that I can't
eat it seeing how similar disco dust is
to nail glitter a lot of you guys asked
a really good question can we put the
so-called cake glitter on our nails you
see now that's what I'm talking about
those are exactly the kinds of important
questions we strive to answer on this
very educational quality content Channel
so I got six different colors of disco
dust or cake glitter whatever you want
to call it let's break out our test nail
swatches and paint everything with a
nice quick one coder black and now we're
going to try and burnish the glitter in
using the burnishing technique with
regular polish I've made another video
on exactly that so you can go check that
out after if you're interested in
learning about this in more detail but
basically first we apply some yellow
stopper it's not gel polish it's just a
tacky base coat and then you gotta let
it dry for about a minute or two until
it gets tacky and it leaves just a
little bit of a finger print now we take
the disco dust let's start off with the
classic silver that may or may not be
the same kind of good or used in the
Diamond cappuccino take an eyeshadow
applicator pick up some hollow and then
buff it into the nail you got to gently
push the glitter down into the tacky
base but at the same time kind of pull
it down so you're smoothing it out to
get a nice flat surface
look at that beautiful let's do the with
all the colors oh my god that is fucking
gorgeous you know what's so weird though
among the black holo glitters there's
also what appears to be tiny pieces of
green plastic or just straight-up
transparent green glitter or maybe it's
green sugar I'm honestly I can't tell
it's kind of weird how they threw in
that green I would have much preferred
the black holo pure shit
oh yeah I'll have my gold cake and nails
to please and then we got a fully
transparent glitter as you can see over
black you're gonna get more of a
greenish orange tint it's not how low is
iridescent but that's what happens when
you order online and you think it's
hollow but when you get it in the mail
it's not here's the bronze one it's a
copper glitter with some green
iridescent litters here's the other
silver which didn't perform as well as
the original disco dust well holy shit
if I put this swatch stick in a nail
salon customers would absolutely choose
from it cuz it looks like legitimate
nail products five out of six of them
applied beautifully just exactly like
actual nail glitter but wait a second we
can't ignore what's on my other hand
it's a goddamn gorgeous bright metallic
blue with hollow glitter polish that
deserves attention because it is so
beautiful it's a new fun lacquer polish
that just came out I put the link down
below in the
scription box as always okay now let's
compare the cake glitter nails to nail
glittered nails trying to that ten times
fast I've got some nail glitter here and
I'm gonna put links to all the things I
use in this video down below what else
is new
not very much how about you hey what do
you know it applies exactly the same as
the disco dust I tried to find the
closest nail glitter color that I could
to match the disco dust that I have I
don't have a perfect match in terms of
shade of the glitter for all of them but
I think I did good with what I had in
fact if I mix up all these clips can you
identify which ones take and which ones
nails cake nails nails cake no nails
hey nails nails cake I don't even know
this makes me think back to that article
that said that these cake glitters do
not differ at all from the giant ten
ounce tub of made in China glitter you
can get at the craft section of Walmart
visually they look the same and you know
what so does so-called makeup glitter is
it all the same I would really love for
someone to do an actual scientific test
and see whether this plastic glitter is
all just the same shit
dear scientist I have a mission it's
time to research bitch
now just for an additional scientific
test I wanted to add a gel taco on the
disco dust glitters because maybe if it
was a more soluble type of plastic but
gel taco would eat it and dissolve it
but nothing happened to them they stayed
perfectly intact and they look better
than ever if you ask me look at that
beautiful beautiful Hollow shine now get
on my nails please peel off base coat
nice one coat black polish yellow
stopper base coat to add a layer of
tackiness wait a minute or two and then
buff that disco dust in oh girl it's a
party on my nails you want something to
eat
Oh too bad because this is not edible I
still don't understand why there's green
bits in here like who made that
executive decision I would like to meet
with the makers of disco dust and be
like bitch who decided to ruin the
purity of the black hollow because
you're fired add a nice thick coat of
glassy taco yeah so thick and so glossy
and then don't forget you gotta bake
that shit for a minute holy shit my
nails are fucking beautiful no one would
believe me if I told them that this was
fake glitter it's still kind of
disappointing that despite being cake
glitters these nails aren't actually
edible but after we made the hollow
cappuccino we made an actually edible
version of it using rainbow colored
sugar and it's just sugar and food
coloring so you can actually put it in
your body so how about we put that on
our nails too just for fun see this shit
looks edible okay it's clearly sugar not
plastic but if I'm gonna put this on my
nails I really don't want to take off
these hollow glitter disco dust ones
because they're so beautiful I guess
we're going to have to sacrifice my
other hand my other hand is said so
first I thought let's make this 100%
edible and see if we can actually stick
on the sugar crystals using a Gavi syrup
it was not sticking at all to a fake
nail and it would also not stick to my
own nail chemistry is so weird how about
some creamed honey honey oh yeah that
one looks like she got a stick perfect
look at that full even coverage
okay maybe not so even but definitely
full now it's time to take a dip in the
sugar crystal pool there that kind of
worked now for the purposes of
wearability I also wanted to try this
dunk method out using a gel taco as the
base coat because I was thinking that if
you dunk the nail in the sugar on top of
a wet gel taco and then you cure it the
little pieces of sugar might get
rock-solid kind of like rock candy and
as it turns out if you do a quick finger
push test on the honey nail the sugar
falls off very easily but on the gel
nail that sugars not going anywhere so
we're gonna go with that because today
we choosing wearability over edibility
now I'm not the first to put sugar on my
nails I've seen lots of other sugar
nails before but using this kind of
sugar really makes it look like rock
candy nails and I kind of want to lick
them pretty good to stop though that's
nail polish right just won't like to
deep just don't encourage people to do
this are they actually edible these ones
are even art that's cake decorating
glitter likewise there sally has a PR
package clearly visible in this whole
shot happy holidays alright guys well I
hope you enjoyed this follow-up video as
always thanks so much for watching then
I'll see y'all later
