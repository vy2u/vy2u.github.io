owner of this channel who else would do
the QA you'll have to excuse me I was
sick for a week after my nail funerals
so now my nails are short and I sound
like an old lady all right so what are
we doing a cube and that stands for
Quidditch and alphabet loads of Polish
asks how are you I'm well thank you for
asking
how are you actually I'm not well I'm
sick why did I say that damn automatic
social response requirements how old
were you when you started painting your
nails well I can't remember so I was
probably very young how deep is your
hollow is it like the ocean yes it is
what inspired you to start a YouTube
channel for painting nails my answer is
going to be very boring I only actually
started my youtube channel after I
finished my master's thesis because all
of a sudden I had too much time on my
hands always make sure you're doing
something and never do nothing your
advice is so clear Christine when did
you realize you were hollow sexual was
it a pivotal point in your life how did
your family react to the news when you
told them I realized I was hollow sexual
probably when I was 12 it was a very
young age and my family did not react to
the news because they don't understand
me who taught you to paint your nails
you're looking at her oh there are so
many questions about bent I am scared
once these questions are for you yeah is
been hollow sexual been oh thank you I
don't think I am
maybe a little hollow curious
okay well we'll fix that by the end of
the day well then have his own YouTube
channel simply been logical and what
would you do on it
I won't actually I do have a there is a
video of him playing Donkey Kong on
YouTube though if you find it bonus how
long have you and Ben been together
where and when did you meet and what
makes you like Ben how long have we been
together three and a half years like
four where and when did you meet
there's no I don't remember I met in
grad school in grad school except he's
apparently stalked me for many years in
undergrad I just didn't know it yet Ben
homosexual I think you meant allosexual
I know that damn autocorrect always
trying to put us into one category when
are you and Ben getting married okay Meg
eight one two three so many people when
are you getting married meg H one two
three
what does then think about your
addiction about your nail polish what
addiction I thought it wouldn't last
I thought you were just gonna like take
pictures of your nails for a few weeks
and then Nafis me over hours later this
is the water marble which coming back
he's right here yes why what do you
prefer eat Mayo the rest of your life or
eat Munchie hair the rest of your life I
can't eat mayo by itself and cats pretty
much eat their hair and their entire
lives so I don't see why I couldn't what
is your favorite ice cream flavor
definitely gold medal ribbon or Moose
Tracks you guys thought I was gonna pick
something boring didn't you do you like
pie yes who doesn't like pie
come on do people seriously not like pie
I love pie especially apple pie with ice
cream that's the best
stupid question I like that you
highlighted that if you could create a
hollow nail-polish with flavor what
would it be probably birthday cake
because that's how I feel like unicorns
would taste if you ate them intelligent
question besides nail-polish what other
obsession could you see yourself
following in the future probably cats I
could see myself following a lot of cats
in the future and I try and steal them
and take them home with me mum was
wondering if you can get maple butter in
Canada yes you can and it is so good you
will never want normal butter again it
tends to separate from the maple syrup
part but that's supposed to happen guys
don't worry it's like oil and water
I think you smell so good what's your
favorite Starbucks not coffee like a
normal adult that's probably what you
think I'm drinking isn't it in fact I
order a peppermint hot chocolate because
I am 12 question what advice would you
give to a boy who wants to wear nail
polish but parents won't let him by the
way I'm 17 well your parents are rude I
believe anyone should be allowed to wear
whatever they want on their nails nail
polish is basically art on your
fingertips and art has no gender don't
mind me just another liberal Canadian
have you ever been in prison that
someone look up my criminal record I
actually have been in prison but not for
what you think the part of my old job we
did go into a women's prison once so yep
technically I've been in a prison have
you ever done extreme sports
yes actually I went to polish Mountain
once and it took me 12 hours what do you
smell like didn't you know if you just
scratch any Canadian they smell like
maple syrup
are you sarcastic no how long is your
hair and inches you're really gonna make
me measure this to push the two I don't
get a second my hair Oh 21 inches it's
probably longer than that
it was up and shit what's it called when
you are hollow sexual but with normal
nail polish boring polish sexual yeah
that's what it's called it was the last
person you texted and what did it saying
oh you want to get personal with me
don't you was to my dad and then it said
happy fun day because it's Father's Day
don't ask me why I call him pleasure as
a joke me and my sister started saying
when we were like 10 and so won't know
why we said it but we still say it do
you have any siblings and are they
younger older than you I have one
sibling her name is Jenny or Jen and she
is younger than I am she was in one
video of mine before I want her to be in
some in the future so let's see if we
can convince her you can bug her on
Twitter this is her handle sorry Jed if
Trump is elected can I live with you
absolutely I completely support you guys
come to Canada we got lots of maple
butter what countries have you been to
well this answers boring Canada and the
United States I've never even left my
time zone okay I'm a world traveler why
do you say so many bad word please stop
saying them but though I am NOT a child
I am an adult to me they are not bad
words subjectivity is the strangest
thing and I eat all of your Hollow so I
can be a disco ball only if I can keep
you and stick you on the ceiling and
spin you around then yes
can you be my hallo mom thought it was
already everyone's mother since everyone
always says mom mom hello can you go how
low can you go how low can you go what
is the best part of being on YouTube
probably laughing at some of these
ridiculous comments have you ever wanted
to kidnap someone yes
Sveta Sanders if you got to be any
animal which one would you be and why I
would be a witch do you snort loose
hollow glitters in your spare time
what advice would you give someone who
wants to be a nail art person on social
media probably not to worry too much
about what people are gonna say I've
learned that no matter how popular you
are whether you're just starting out or
you're really big there's gonna be some
ignorant idiots who tell you your shit
sucks don't listen to them they are sad
people do I have to go to school for the
rest of my life and what if I just want
to be youtuber like you oh yes you need
to go to school for the rest of your
life no not for the rest of your life
just so you can get a solid education
that will allow you to realize any
career goals that make sense for you but
it would never be my advice to drop out
of school or not continue with education
to just try and be a youtuber that would
be terrible advice if you haven't
noticed I believe in education a lot
just stay in school kids stay in school
and your parents will let you keep
watching my videos even if I swear how
did you name your cats
well we named Benji after munchies
frozen yogurt because I like ice cream I
like to eat you just like ice cream oh
there see I'm eating my cat's hair and I
named is oiler after nothing actually I
don't know I just picked a random name
and then put his head in front of it
cuz I like being different oh look who
actually came to say hi Zeiler he
normally hates the camera are you in a
good mood today are you in a good mood
okay nope okay bye bye when did you
realize you were alive when I found
Paolo will you ever do a meet-and-greet
if so where love you and your videos do
people want to meet me and greet me or
do I greet greet them I don't know how
these things work but I have some news
that I should tell you I'm going to
VidCon
next week no this week where we
commanded in this video so I will be
there in a different time zone in
another country I don't really know I am
going I wasn't invited or anything
people just told me I should go so I was
like okay I'll go I don't have a meet
and greet signing or a lottery or a
booth or a number I am the worst
youtuber ever but if you see me come say
hello I must warn you I am ten times
more awkward in person than I am on
camera but it's okay when I have nothing
to say because I don't know how to
conduct myself in social situations I
just go like this look at my nails look
at the hollow look at these snails for
short nails as I know you haven't seen
that yet okay I'll show you later
if you want to stalk me while I'm at
VidCon or if you're not going to VidCon
and you want to see me experience
America you can follow me on social
media on all these social medias I'm
going abroad Ben's coming with me so we
