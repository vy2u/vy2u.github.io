again you know that channel you come to
for anything but now art well joke's on
you because today i'm gonna do nail art
bitch I saw many MUA make a video on
recreating a fans makeup look and I
thought wow that's perfect let's just
take ideas from our subscribers it's
been so long since I've done a nail art
video on this channel thank you for
subscribing and I need some nails for a
shake so on Twitter snapchat and
Instagram I asked you guys if you were a
hollow sexual that does nail art so how
about we check out Twitter first and see
what we got simply recreate me we've got
a smartass hollow sexual here always got
to love that oh my god that is beautiful
look at it look so similar to other
things I've done cuz that's like the
only thing I ever do is dark color and
Hollow talk oh I need a real challenge
people wow that's so good okay not that
challenging beauty and the standing
plates wow that's so cool I don't have
that stamping plate though so got out of
that one ooh I like this one
yeah that's the one oh this girl's nails
are so long I call her tied pod nails
why didn't I think of that like a month
or two ago when it mattered oh that's so
pretty the constellations but again I
would need that particular stamping
plate I also don't know how to stamp
very well so today there is lots of
talent on Twitter but we got to give a
chance to Instagram because Instagram is
the original place where I joined the
nail art community that was once
flourishing and full of creativity back
in 2015 before there was ever an
algorithm can I get a
repeat answer and please now we can
never see the posts of those we follow
you guys know I started on Instagram way
back in the day when I had no face and
no voice and I was there for much less
annoying Wow well that's beautiful
is that Rob's account oh oh shit that's
water from bowl we're just gonna keep
scrolling pretend you didn't see it and
keep scrolling how did you do that are
you French artist oh my god look at all
these amazing nail artists on Instagram
see you don't need me there's too many
good ones now how am I supposed to pick
you know I asked for nails for Asian and
now I just have too much so I'm
obviously drawn to the ones that are
Paulo like this that's beautiful it's
not really nail art oh yeah it is it
says 24 on it
happy birthday - napkin nails but I want
to pick something that I haven't done
myself and that would be challenging for
me so basically we looking for an ugly
creme manicure how am I gonna choose
guys oh my god that is six
oh my god that is beautiful how did she
do that it's a pinky conspiracy she set
that one up just for me it's so good
it's even her profile pic okay we're
gonna follow her back what has drawn me
to this one is questioning how the fuck
did she do that
birthday to me did you ask for a holo on
top no what do you know what you don't
have plates you believe that there's
five million people who actually hit
that subscribe button
well there's the boss this is so amazing
it calls for a giveaway we're gonna
figure that out I should give away my
channel why don't you guys tell me what
kind of giveaway you want if you say
MacBooks I will unsubscribe you myself
comment down below where you think we
should go on vacation and take a break
from making videos and just relax for
once because we've been working going
anywhere
I'm not going anywhere he might be
comment down below we're actually good
occasion anyways well shit I'm out tea
already back what's up party people hey
that's me and now the question is does
this account do tutorials dammit alright
let's check out this account that
inspired the pinkie conspiracy
cat they're so cute okay we're getting
distracted that's it
they're so beautiful oh my god I made a
gradient with these colors then use
liquid latex as a barrier instead of a
nail mile interesting then I sponge the
layers darker and darker
all the while using the latex to protect
it farther and farther down to create
the scaled gradient easy Dale gradient
blast from the past so for those of you
who have been following it for a super
long time I was really big into what I
called scaled gradients which meant a
gradient on top of the gradient on top
of the gradient but not like layering
this way but like this way all right
then
pinky conspiracy it's time for me to
attempt to recreate your nails now first
things first it's time for some feel may
not be nail art I'm peeling up but it's
still damn sexy nail polish first things
first we're gonna need a base coat but
unfortunately I'm sorry to tell you that
I will not be putting on a peel off base
coat today the truth is while I would
love to be able to peel off whatever I
create here today doing a gradient never
mind a scaled gradient is incredibly
difficult if you're working with a peel
off base coat because you're just
increasing your risk of peeling off the
entire nail in the middle of your
artwork so to reduce that risk pretty
much completely we're gonna use a
regular base coat all right let's pick
out our colors
wow what a beautiful color story so
inspiring
now I want to do my makeup you've colors
I'm gonna start off with this bright
neon reddish orange
the bass well simply still got it she
can paint her nails with one color
before any gradient one must protect
themselves with liquid latex I've
definitely done nail art in the past
using this color scheme because I love
these color scheme and I've done a few
skill gradients but I've never really
done that mountain sunset look and I've
always wanted to do it and I just never
ended up doing it and next we need some
makeup sponges oh god there's nail
polish hasn't been opened in like four
years now this gradient only needs to
extend a half way down the nail so we
got a tight space to work with the
secret is doing very skinny stripes of
each color of Polish so that you can
blend multiple colors without it all
just turning into brown shit ready in
honor of the pinky conspiracy we're
gonna start with my pinky
now one and I already purple is too dark
shit dead what do we do all this nail
polish and I can't find the right shade
purple and a one spray tan entire blog
post dedicated to gradients and calls it
the gradient guide maybe I should read
my own advice we're going to move on to
the next nail there's a minty here
alright how does that look
not terrible yes my favorite part makes
it all worth it yeah alright now I've
cleaned up a little and it's time for
the next we got to do another gradient
or seven but before we do that because
we got to put liquid latex on the nail
to create the next gradient on top of
this gradient we need a glassy dug out
bitch just a nice thick coat of glossy
tack now we gotta let it dry because a
pack lock we're gonna add liquid latex
in place of nelvana's next how do we do
this okay we got to think about this one
mathematically the darkest Mountain
layer on top other medium blue down to
layer on top of it need to go mentally
which means you got whatever it's I
start with indigo mountain there so
that's what halfway up a nail but where
do you put nail art is a science that's
why I always love scale gradients cuz
there was such a might cover up this and
we make mountains going the other
direction the top of the mountain is the
darkest blue but we don't want to make
the rest of the nail completely blue
because you want to see some of the
orange come out at the bottom of the
mountain behind the other two mountains
are following me it is inspiring seeing
all the artists out there seeing some of
your ideas they're so creative they're
so over the box try something may be a
little crazy a little something could be
I just made up a jingle okay everybody
hold their breath they got it worked
Alicia I am like a bottle of nail polish
good mountain range well no what's next
and I said code a glassy taco and I
often see the question doesn't this make
your nails too thick when you add so
many different coats of nail polish and
topcoat in between the nail polish and
the answer is yes and that's how I like
my nails I really don't find that it's a
problem it's not a problem anymore as
long as you're using a good quick dry
glossy taco and you're actually letting
it fully dry and cure the nail polish
underneath and you can just keep adding
layers layers and layers girl go to
polish mountain if you want it's not
that far we already like eight coats in
here's where it gets really tricky we
got to make the mountain line enough
down distinguish between this mountain
line up pretty wasn't enough space but
I'd like at this point no one cares
about the instructions because no one
else is going to do this are they
something must've gone wrong in my brain
got these chemicals all up in my brain
nail polish hey my name's Christine
watching me what do I do where did I go
wrong
you know lots of youtubers are turning
into singers these days I think I got a
shot
I did it I think how does it compare it
looks pretty good the colors are
slightly off maybe the sunset behind
isn't quite the same color of gradient I
blame my lack of nail polish selection
here but wait I'm missing one thing
when in doubt aha lo tanto I like how
much I've infected my viewers minds now
pinky conspiracy didn't just pick any
hollow taco she clearly picked a
scattered hollow taco so that she didn't
cover up the beautiful gradient design
underneath I just realized we haven't
talked about what's on my other hand
it's actually a layer of a few different
things I started out with the black
crown polish then layered it with some
hollow taco flakies and then added an
iridescent taco because bitch I'm extra
and now we're adding a final last coat
of glassy taco to seal in the hollow
taco and all the other talks we put on
our news today I did it I did one of
your nail arts and I didn't fail well
you know it's not perfect but I'm proud
of myself I went outside of my comfort
zone which recently has has been
anything but nail art pinky conspiracy I
hope I did you proud I had fun doing
this you know at first I was a little
stressed thinking who is she sometimes
it's nice to sit down and do your nails
for six hours and another big sock thank
you from 5 million subscribers on this
thing we call YouTube I'm not good at
emotions so I will excuse myself because
I am a sock don't forget to let me know
down below in the comments what kind of
things you guys might want to see me
give away alright everybody thanks so
much for watching and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
