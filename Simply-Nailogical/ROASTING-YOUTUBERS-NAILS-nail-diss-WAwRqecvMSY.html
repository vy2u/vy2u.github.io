blog recently and called me a big
youtuber so yeah bitch well my friends I
hope you're full of the Rose now in case
it wasn't clear this video was not
serious at all I'm actually surprised by
how many youtubers have good nails to be
completely honest this video is mostly
an excuse to wear sunglasses no I'm not
hungover and no I didn't get plastic
surgery to fit in with a beauty guru
actually have some kind of bullshit
or allergic reaction around my eyes
which has never happened to me before
you can't really see from this far away
but I can assure you up close it's ugly
been like this for a few weeks now so I
don't know what I'm gonna do and yes to
all the doctors in the comments I saw
one of your colleagues recently and they
prescribed me some cream shit but
nothing really seems to be working and
she said I might be allergic to makeup
and you know what I said you doctor I'm
a beauty guru and then I dabbed on her
hater okay but seriously how am I
supposed to do makeup videos when my
face is but does this mean I actually
have to do my nails why don't you guys
leave me some video ideas of what you'd
like to see me do on this channel down
below in the comment section and I'll
see what I can do about that
alright this was a video brought to you
by simply savage logical and we're gonna
sign off right now I'm painting my nails
