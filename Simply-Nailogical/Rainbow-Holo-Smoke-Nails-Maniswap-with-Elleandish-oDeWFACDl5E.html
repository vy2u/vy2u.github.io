just awesome hallo everyone it's me
christine again and today i am super
excited to bring you something new to
you to all my fellow instagramers out
there have probably heard of this thing
called a mani swap and it's when two
different nail artists get together
choose a look that the other nail art is
created and then recreate that look on
their own nails and today I'm bringing
you a mani swap with Janel from Ellen
dish back in January Janelle did these
awesome rainbow e-smoke fails I do
believe she was initially inspired by
bad girl nails who was inspired by
chalkboard nails to do these smoked
nails - what that really means is I was
inspired by Ellen dish was inspired by
bad girl nails she was inspired by
chalkboard nails to do these nails
inspiration section for all of you who
haven't had the pleasure of seeing an
Ellen dish tutorial yet you must go
check out her channel I put the link
down below in the video description box
I honestly love her videos they are so
well produced her editing is flawless
and so exciting to watch because she
puts so much effort into it
her tutorials are right to the point and
straightforward unlike mine and she does
a lot of tests on her channel like the
tumblr nail or fail series which is what
I picked this mani from she also has
these freaking adorable little nail
polish bottles that talk to each other
at the end of her videos they're like
minions but better because their nail
polish also have you heard her voice
hello everyone its Janelle and today's
video theme will be a tumblr nail or
fail honestly she could sing me
lullabies it is so soothing okay
Christine stop being creepy just go
subscribe to her channel now let's get
started yeast so I had to put on a peel
off base coat obviously cuz it's gonna
be epic when I peel these off and I'm
just
paint all my nails black oh don't you
hate it when you paint outside the nail
I just use a cleanup brush and acetone
to get that out but you black polish are
very stubborn today
and I'm gonna add a quick dry top coat
cuz we're gonna add nail vinyls next no
we're not I'm just so used to saying
that we are not adding nail vinyls
repeat no nail vinyls next I'm going to
take some brushes mail our brushes I
don't use these very often and I'm gonna
take these nice flat silky ones you can
find them at the link below in the video
description box because we're gonna
paint with acrylic paint first I'm just
gonna add a little bit of water to my
nail art mat and then I'm gonna mix in
some white acrylic paint because that's
what's going to give us a smokey effect
I'm using this nail art mat because it
has these awesome little circles that
contains the water and paint so that it
doesn't spill over and splash everywhere
you can find this really neat nail art
mat at the link below in the video
description box it's almost as if I say
that for every single product I mention
oh my god links are below no kidding
that's so much convenient
does anyone remember when stores were
called convenience stores no one goes to
them anymore because they just order
online so basically what I was doing
will out slobbing is adding a bit more
water to the white to make it look kind
of smoky and milky milky and all you got
to do is paint that liquidy white right
on your nail next now this is key in
order to soak up some of the water to
leave the smoke effect behind you got to
get a fresh brush that's dry because
when the bristles are dry they'll pick
up some of the watery shit science from
here on out I don't really have any
techniques to tell you in particular
that was pretty much the technique and
now it's just me fucking around right
now I think I was just adding more water
to make it a little smell
here and make more white stains because
that's really what you're doing here so
you're staining your black male with
white crusty white stains hey that's
what they are crusty white stains I
decided to make the smoke a little bit
whiter so that the rainbow nail polish
we're gonna use next really popped over
the white a that looks cool though those
nails look dope though Snoop Doggy no no
smoke a float oh whoa whoa
Kristine whoa I was trying to make a
drug joke but that went in a completely
different direction hey kids look it's
all the rainbow neon polish everything
is fine everything is fine so I
basically just took my rainbow polishes
one by one put them in the mat added a
bunch of acetone to it I think you have
to use 100% acetone I'm not sure but
that's what I did and then sloppily
threw it on the nail on top of the white
stuff Shirley I immediately realized
that applying acetone on top of the
acrylic paint started to eat away at it
but I mean that's why I wanted to try
out this design you know try something
new you don't know what the hell's gonna
happen but it could turn out awesome
which I think it did even though I
didn't know what I was doing while I was
doing it it's not what all successful
amazing artists say anyways well I don't
know it just threw it together to turn
into this piece that everyone wants to
buy for a million dollars not to worry I
will be putting these Keeley's up for
auction on eBay and so slowly but surely
I more or less blended these three
colors of nail polish together across
the nail but to make them even more
fabulous we go to add a hollow topcoat
because you can't deny your hollow
sexuality
have you seen my what's the best hollow
topcoat video you should watch it if
you're a true hollow sexual whoo hey
what do you know I think I just unlocked
the galaxy bonus he started as rainbow
smoked nails I swear but everything is
better with holo now I'm adding a final
glossy top coat just to make these nails
super shiny so that no one can miss them
we can't have anyone not see these in
their life that would just be so sad and
bam you ask me I would say these nails
look great I mean like I totally
intended it to look this way so I knew
that it was gonna turn out like this and
look this good and this 3-dimensional
I'm fully aware that this doesn't really
look anything like Janelle's original
mani but sometimes I get carried away
okay okay now make sure the next thing
you do is check out Janelle's channel
aka Ellen dish so you can see her
recreate this man you fine

this one I told her it was nail art
suicide but she's still alive so props
