right I did because I got a special
collection of hollows to show you in
today's video I worked with super chic
lacquer a brand that's completely new to
me but I've heard a lot about them and
how they're hollow sword rates obviously
I had to try them to bring you this
video that is so hollow sexually
satisfying I mean my hollow senses are
tingling for those of you that may be
new here
hollow means hollow graphic aka rainbows
and nail polish sex in a bottle welcome
to the freakshow we're gonna do these
bomb-ass hollow rainbow gravy and edgy
meal today and before I get started I
just want to let you know that you can
get 10% off with my code simply of
course what else is new Christine
nothing nothing else is new anyways I
put the link below if you want to go do
that and yeah start off by protecting
your nails with your favorite base coat
I don't know why I just said that I've
never used this base coat before is
something out to get my nails someone
please inform me what is coming to get
me so I can be safe I am very scared
right now
okay trollee trollee that's enough out
you in all seriousness this base coat is
supposed to help prevent against stains
obviously I can't test it for that can i
it's also a color bond er which means
that it's great for people who want
their nail polish to last a long time
you probably want that okay now let's
get to painting ooh
realm of erotica I like this collection
already um did I just do one coat replay
replay replay oh my god it is one cup
okay so this whole collection called the
dreamology collection is one KOTOR
hollows what I didn't swatch these
myself but if you want to see some live
action one coat or nail slathering
action you can go to Jeff's face 90
video rapid eye movement eh that's what
happens when you look at black hollow
your eyes start doing this
and it's also one code or yes sorry
there's hollow in my throat okay so that
was my other now now back to my red now
Christine you should probably would
mention these things I'm applying some
simply peel on my finger on my nail to
protect it because shits about to get
erotic with some holo gradient action
and this is what you should do if you
get too excited and put on too much
simply peel on your nail
now I'm gonna swipe on five of super
cheeks juicy hollows on a makeup sponge
cuz I'm gonna do my makeup no you're not
look at that look at that juicy rainbow
squish oh hahaha so cheesy d stop
staring at the rainbows and actually
sponge it on your nail before it dries
just a little dab dab dab to make you
fab shout-out to my friend the robot and
that was one coat of dabbing what all
the colors are they're home icon these
hollows are so big I cry I feel like I'm
just doing a second coat because it
feels unnatural not to do a second coat
of gradient if you know what I mean but
guys like holy these hollows are
freaking opaque and now it's time to
peel off simply peel like no big deal
yeah I think you're feel so fresh when I
do that sip some Hollow had to sneak out
of my protection didn't show you a
little bugger and now I'm gonna add
super sheiks new to me quick dry top
coat because I've heard a lot about
those top coat some even say that it
rivals glisten and glows HK girl quick
dry top coat the one that I use all the
time and no matter how great I tell you
that it actually worked and it was
awesome to use with nail vinyls next
people are just gonna accuse me of lying
because this is a sponsored video and
that's a whole other ranch that I should
probably save for something more
appropriate like snapchat so whatever
trust me if you trust me and yell at me
if you don't I like this top coat God
next we got a diamond glitter topper and
apparently it has real diamonds in this
what and now we know that when se said
they were trying to find diamond dust to
put in the new starry starry night they
lied they lied to us as you love
now let's take a closer look at these
crown jewels in help me I want help me
help me I'm getting carried away with
the nail born I can't stop there's so
many rainbow tape everywhere drip all
over me you should you're fun
is this an LR tutorial or a nail porno
sometimes I'm not sure back on my
rainbow nail it's now dry so we can add
some stripe nail vinyls because I'm
going to add a black hollow line down
the center like a badass bitch come to
think of it these hollows are great for
using with nail vinyls because they're
all one coat so you don't got to worry
about layers and transparency issues and
now just for a little bit of extra edge
to tie the whole look together I put the
crown jewels glitter topper down the
center of the black hollow stripe and I
really wanted this triangle to be right
here in particular and to finish
everything off I'm topping it with the
super chic marbled liquid macro glossy
top coat this is the same one I used
earlier and I realized that it's really
hard to communicate some form of
evidence about how good this topcoat is
or how fast it dries short of me just
telling you this and no I'm not going to
do a what's the best quick dry topcoat
games because I don't have two years
that's how long it would take me to
accurately test the long-lasting
abilities of all the quick dry top coats
in the land but at minimum I can show
you that this top coat is in fact glossy
in case you were wondering and that's it
for today's super simple and easy but
edgy rainbow holo sexual look if you
like these hollows as much as I do you
can check them out yourself at super
chic lacquer store I put the link down
below and you can use my code simply for
10% off your entire order almost all my
codes are simply sometimes I'm just like
on a random nail shops or and I just
type in discount code simply to see if
it'll work does anyone else do this I
guess the only weird part is is that I
should probably know where I have codes
but okay whatever nevermind now give
this video a thumbs up if you're a hall
of sexual and thanks so much for
watching I'll see y'all later Bob
