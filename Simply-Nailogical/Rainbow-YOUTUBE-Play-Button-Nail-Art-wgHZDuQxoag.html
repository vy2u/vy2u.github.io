its logo rainbow so I made the YouTube
rainbow logo on my nails naturally some
of you may have seen these fabulous
rainbow youtube nails at VidCon some
quick mouth wash but funny story
actually did these nails on the same day
that YouTube released its proud to be
video a new rainbow logo and I hadn't
even seen the rainbow logo yet I got
home from work I did these nails because
I wanted to make youtube rainbow for
VidCon and then I realized that YouTube
had made a rainbow logo
great minds think alike YouTube's great
minds think alike
so my nails are short currently having
flashbacks of Charma to make this mani
last I'm using not a peel off base coat
for once
Ohio it's a miracle and as I record this
voiceover I've had these nails on for 11
days now we gonna add some white we're
gonna add some what because rainbows
look back - why don't you now it add
some liquid latex and don't be afraid to
get right in there around the cuticle
because this time I don't need to worry
about it peeling off my peel-off base
coat I went for a more cool toned
rainbow color scheme YouTube obviously
copied me now because my nails are so
much shorter than usual I need to make a
very narrow rainbow on the makeup sponge
but don't put them too close together or
else all the colors will blend together
and look like do a little dab dab
dab on the nail
do the rainbow dab to the rainbow dance
to the rainbow dance stab dance now Cal
stop I find very thin light coats of
whatever gradient you're putting on your
nail works best so work in thin layers
don't put too much on the sponge at once
I think I may have done 4 coats I'm not
sure I don't remember it was so long ago
now we go on peel I simply peel like no
big deal I'm talking in this accent cuz
I just came back from America murica
murica use a clean up brush dipped in
acetone to get off any excess gradient
mask
need to now what's a rainbow without a
hollow top code it's a boring rainbow we
got to make all the rainbows in the
world how I'm using a scattered hollow
topcoat I showed it off in mine what's
the best hollow topcoat video or you can
find it at the link below now even
though the hollow topcoat is technically
a topcoat I'm putting on an actual quick
dry super thick glossy taco because I
just really like tacos okay no but
seriously it's to make them mani last
longer you see how I cap it or wrap the
tips under the edge that will help it
last so do that and now ladies and
gentlemen we have ourselves a double
rainbow I swear I have taken no drugs
today now on my ring finger we're gonna
do the play button instead of the hollow
top coat first I'm going to apply a
quick try glossy top coat because we're
gonna paint acrylic paint on top of that
you got to let that dry for a really
long time probably like half an hour to
an hour if you want to be able to
scratch off the acrylic paint with the
toothpick which I always want to do
because I always make mistakes now I am
drawing the inverse of the play button
or attempting to draw the inverse of the
play button where is the middle of my
fingernail where is it okay I think I
found it that yeah okay this is this is
more centered good job me if I sound
like I got some up my nose it's
because I still do I am still getting
over a second cold that hollow sexuals
must have given me at VidCon man just
kidding I don't know why I'm sick again
it's probably because I never sleep yeah
I should probably go to bed one one day
yes so keep applying thin coats of your
white acrylic paint to fill in your play
button speaking of play button YouTube I
have not got mine yet I want to hollow
play button anyways now you see me using
the toothpick trick to make the edges of
the play button look better yes I could
have used white nail polish instead of
acrylic paint but if I did that I
wouldn't be able to scratch it away like
this and I always need to be able to
correct my mistakes and now to complete
the look we add a hollow taco because I
could not let the white play button get
away with just being white then I add a
final quick coat of quick dry glossy top
coat to seal everything in and keep it
on forever and now I am proud to be
Hollow sexual okay let me just clarify
before some people get offended I never
intend to diminish or take away from the
hashtag proud to be campaign or any
other LGBT equality movements for that
matter by using the term hollow sexual
if you guys know me then you know I am
absolutely in support of equality I mean
does anyone remember this video if you
think my American pride flag males are
corrupting your nation's symbol or
whatever it's nail art calm down I'm
Canadian so of course I'm a liberal
beaver and I believe everyone should be
able to love whoever they want and be
whoever they are I love hollow so I am a
hollow sexual yes it may not be a
serious intimate relationship well you
never know but but it's supposed to be a
light-hearted way of expressing my love
for it part of the ten commandments of
being a hollow sexual is being for
equality and the choice to love whoever
or whatever you want I don't know what
the other nine are so don't ask
in the end hollow sexuals love rainbows
I mean come on no and this is 11 days
later not one chip anywhere I do have
some tips to share with you guys on how
to make your mani last like this but I
think I'll save it for another video
because there's just too much to say and
so for now thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
