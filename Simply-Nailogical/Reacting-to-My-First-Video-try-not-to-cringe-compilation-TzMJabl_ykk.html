all other youtubers talk about a video
for five minutes that you didn't click
on well hello 2018 it's me Christine
again happy new year everyone all right
so what we gonna do today reacting to my
first video I am officially a real
youtuber now because I have run out of
good content ideas so bad that I'm just
gonna sit here and react to my own
videos so usually the youtuber is
actually physically in their first video
and I am NOT in like the first several
dozen videos on my channel because my
nails were the star of the show so
instead of only reacting to my first
video which was just like a one-minute
nail tutorial we're gonna wash it in a
second I'm gonna react to a couple of my
first milestone videos which includes my
first video with my voice in it and then
my first video with my face in it and
maybe you will throw in a couple in
between just to keep things spicy simply
no logical I still wonder why did that
many people ever subscribe it amazes me
it perplexes me it it puzzles me sort by
oldest when you being a real creeper
alligator green single Chevron scales
gradient now that's a cliff Bait title
if I've ever seen look at that thumbnail
wow that would be funny if that actually
was my thumb but it's not
it was my middle finger June 17 2014
were you born yet please say yes please
details materials and steps on the blog
oh my god royalty free music source mics
no animal which is not royalty free
Christine and then I swear it was so
long after I published this video maybe
like a year later then I got a copyright
strike I don't make any money off my
first video
but liberation music SME on behalf of
Columbia for Mike snow makes money off
of it I'd obviously tried to remove the
song because like I also don't want to
be in trouble over this but it wouldn't
let me do it because the video already
had like a hundred thousand views or
something and you can't make changes
after that so I'm sorry Mike snow I
didn't know Google lied to me so instead
we're gonna watch this video on mute Wow
that's my bathroom what is wrong with
the resolution the old cat clock mr. cat
clock you've always been with me
thank you little skills gradient I'm
making I remember these days I was so
obsessed with making complicated
gradients and like different layers of
gradients it was so exciting now you
know I also had no friends Oh cute now
it's not very apparent but there
actually is holo in this manicure I just
hadn't figured out how to make the
lights perfect for holo settings just in
case you were worried I wonder what the
comments are saying remember when she
actually did nail videos hahaha quality
content who watch this in 2017
how about 2018
huh a quick little history lesson on why
I made my youtube channel exist I used
to be mainly a nail art Instagrammer
where for several months or maybe a year
I had already been posting a bunch of
different nail art photos and then
started posting nail art videos back in
the days where they only allowed 15
seconds a lot of my followers were
telling me that they wanted longer
versions of videos because 15 seconds
was not enough to learn how to do the
nail art again back when I actually
taught something with my influence I
uploaded an announcement post saying
that I was now starting a YouTube
channel it is time for a YouTube account
a YouTube account a YouTube channel
amaura I've been hush-hush about this
because I had no idea what I was doing
still don't I don't know about you but
my eyes roll to the back of my head when
I see an 8-minute nail art video there
will be no talking in my videos just
doing get to the fucking nail arts
already
this is the irony Benji the irony mange
mange those were the days of one minute
no talking nail our tutorials and
thumbnails that were literally just
screen grabs from the video while we're
here all the way back in 2014
why don't we watch my very first channel
trailer that I had posted in September
of that year let's see how convincing I
was
got to admit the most entertaining thing
about that was the actually royalty-free
music and this was supposed to be my
sales pitch awesome nail art tutorials
so you can have awesome nails
okay now let's watch the very first time
the internet heard my voice so it should
be easy to spot when I started talking
in my videos because most of the early
ones are only one minute or less and so
the timestamp alone would give away
whether there was no talking because it
was just way too short
shit nail artists say December 11th 2014
brought to you by 12 of your favorite
nail artists from the online nail art
community in other words Instagram
really don't feel like wake up and make
up no one else found this funny except
for us sadly I order more to make it
worth the shipping okay I'm not gonna
play the whole video here but if you
want to watch it I've linked it down
below for your viewing pleasure well
just take a quick look at the parts that
I was in but this one is actually
different cuz there's a larger sex
particle I don't really care my house
was so clean back then that was so fun
so I guess technically the first time
anyone heard my voice and saw my face on
YouTube was in this video shit niller to
say there's definitely not really a
voiceover and I wouldn't really consider
this like a real video where it was me
talking to the camera the whole time
like most youtubers first videos are so
we're gonna hunt for those actual video
firsts too because we got to react to
them all they're all 1 minute 1 minute 1
minute 13 minutes how to make amazing
now video tutorials
maybe I should watch and learn something
hi guys welcome to my video tutorial on
how to make not just any nail video
tutorial but amazing nail video
tutorials who is this bitch and someone
please get her a cup of tea
first things first I use an actual
camera which means that I don't film
with my iPhone or Android phone I said
I'm so boring and sad a blackberry who
is making videos with blackberries not
not telling of how much times have
changed I like to use the black foam
background because it's not a problem
it's not a problem anymore
it's not a problem anymore it's not a
problem anymore it's not a problem with
this tripod it's very easy to adjust the
height change the camera angle and
adjust the camera rotation it's like I'm
literally giving a technology tutorials
so extends into a full-sized floor try
so air is designed to zoom but then you
lose some of the macro capabilities of
macro lenses so thorough and educational
what what was my first nail tutorial
voiceover aha here it is pretty pink
leopard nails with glitter exclamation
mark surprise I'm talking again
pretty pink leopard nails oh my god
that's so pretty cuz they're paying
perfect and for easy coats no I don't
think so not when I got nail art to do
bitch by the way I actually hate pink
leopard
I know I was being sarcastic but did
other people who are watching this
probably not and it's April Fool's April
Fool's no it's not it's April 2nd so it
looks like after that I did go back to
doing a couple non voiceover nail art
tutorials but then hey guys so
apparently you want me to talk in my
nail art videos which I don't really
know why cause personally when I watch
nail art tutorials when people are
talking it's really annoying and I kind
of just want to tell them to shut up and
just show me the nail art already okay
all right so this was the moment of
change honestly and I still feel this
way sometimes when I personally want to
learn something most people take too
long to explain something and I am very
impatient so I guess I had that in mind
when I was making most of my videos only
one minute with no talking because I was
thinking that there's got to be people
out there like me who are just as
frustrated and impatient but it turns
out most people wanted me to talk and
now everyone who suggested that how you
regrets it and with every added new nail
art tutorial I got more and more
questions asking me to put my face on
camera because the voice just wasn't
enough you had to know everything about
me didn't just my first real talking to
the camera video was
American pride nails and my gay kitchen
Benji auntie did you hear that
oh gee intro it's the fourth of July or
whatever coming up so how about American
pride flag nails my god I'm so awkward
cuz America just legalized gay marriage
and all states here's a history lesson
oh my god simply no logical is a face so
this was a big step for me I remember
being really uncomfortable filming this
but you can probably tell watching it
America ah gonna be a homosexual nation
this is my attempt at humor 6% of you
are male YouTube knows what you're doing
male species it's increased to 10% now
the world is not ending it's just
changing get over yourselves and lighten
up let people love who are the holiday
want thinking back that was a pretty
bold video to post but at the time I
thought like it was no big deal because
everyone I knew in my life around me
thought the same way that I did but I
think that was the first time that I
realized on a much grander scale that
there's a lot of people out there
operating on the internet who have very
strong opinions on things and do not
agree with what I was raised to believe
that sounds obvious of course people
have different opinions on things but at
the time I just hadn't really truly been
exposed to what I saw later in the
comment section also like where are my
eyebrows my god seriously Christina I
mean I do my eyebrows ten times better
today even when I'm not wearing makeup
what what else do we guy around the same
time how to pretend you can paint four
nail artists hey guys it's my face again
this is setting a terrible precedent
everyone's gonna expect me to do weird
things on camera now firing myself do
you realize how annoying it is to put on
makeup on the weekends I'm sorry what
makeup it looks like I'm not wearing
anything just pink lipstick now that's
one thing that has changed a hell of a
lot
make up blow up except not today I don't
mean today of course over the years I've
gotten lots of comments from people
telling me that I've changed as if I
didn't know this information but to be
honest I very often see this you've
changed comment used as a form of
criticism about a youtuber where the
commenter is suggesting like it's a bad
thing that the person has changed so
much and now they're a bad person
and looking back at these videos yeah of
course I've changed just like when I
changed three years prior to YouTube
just a lot less people noticed I
challenge you to go find a video of
yourself from 3 years ago maybe you'll
find one on Facebook remember when that
was cool and tell me after watching that
video that you haven't changed at all
you might watch yourself back and cringe
a little or maybe you'll wonder why
you're saying stupid expressions like oh
my god it's so on fleek but ultimately
it's nothing to hate yourself for or
actually be embarrassed about because
you've grown up
you've changed your style you've grown
out of things and into new things I'm
the most sentimental sock you have ever
seen I think it's also really important
for people to remember that especially
for young people in the course of say a
three-year period you might change
relationships your school trajectory
jobs your career path and those kinds of
major life changes can have a huge
impact on your personality at that time
and also your confidence your
self-concept your decision making and
online behavior change is that always
bad I do I look like a conehead this was
not the kind of sock I aspired to be
life is just too short man to not be a
mentee are you a shrimp are you a
chicken drumstick you can be whatever
you want to be sweetie and we should be
happy and grateful that we do live in an
era more than any other before us where
it's more accepted for you to just be
whoever you want to be it's also
important to remember that for youtubers
at least what you see on camera is
probably not how they act 24/7 like how
I act around my family or a Starbucks
barista or my co-workers at work
or been when the cameras aren't rolling
is obviously gonna be a little different
than how I act when I'm filming videos
that will go on the internet to millions
of people can you imagine if I was this
annoying at work and I walk into the
boardroom for the monthly team meeting
and I go but is the project plan real
hollow it is not appropriate to behave
that way for the situation however on
here I am free to behave as crazily as I
wanted to
isn't that right matchy-matchy feel like
sometimes people ask me why I only favor
mention why I never bring Zeiler in here
but the truth is I try and bring Zeiler
in here and then he runs away let's see
if he'll come in little special treat
for you incoming incoming cat
I'm impressed xyler you've changed
oh that man he hasn't he's the same old
Zeller renacchi we gotta say by now
alright everybody thanks so much for
watching and we'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
