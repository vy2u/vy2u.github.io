Christine again and I know what you're
thinking but is going on on my head it's
a good thing that this is a nail art
channel and not a hair tutorial chin
what is this it's like a beehive I don't
even know and like why is this not the
same color is this I think they call
this like hombre where it's lighter at
the bottom except I didn't do this on
purpose the hair goes down to my butt
but I'm not going to show you that
because that's not what kind of channel
this is you know how I get my hair so
long and strong hair thirst the only
reason why my hair is so long is because
I haven't cut it in 9 years I can't
teach your about hair so let's talk
about nails hey I don't even know what
to do with my hair it's so hot in here
there's so many lights I should probably
start the video now bubble nails that's
a thing so I've heard yes I know it's
not exactly a new thing and I may have
missed the boat on this one but there's
no boat it's just your imagination
people have been asking me to do bubble
nails and I'm like what and so I googled
it and I had nightmares for weeks here's
what came to my mind I want to eat your
nails I just want to like pick them off
and put them in my mouth your nails must
be swollen you clearly have an infection
you should probably go to the doctor
call the surgeon maybe you need
antibiotics
I don't know and better check with the
nurse because you should probably bring
that swelling down if you're Canadian
will probably be covered under your
health care plan if you're American well
too bad I don't
health care systems like the rest the
world okay don't hate emails look like
my grandma's knuckles I'm pretty sure
that you have arthritis in your
fingernails your nails look like those
little mushroom heads and Mario games
how many points did you get negative I
kind of want to pop your nails like a
zit when your nail tech is having a bad
day and they accidentally put enough
nail on your nail for ten people okay
let's play devil's advocate just for fun
you remember back in the 90s when nail
art was considered really tacky no
that's because you weren't born yet okay
well I'll just talk to myself then and
all the other old people watching my
videos
in any case painting random shapes or
glitter or whatever on your nails was
really tacky and you only did it if you
were in the same but now look at it
everyone's doing up crazy on their
nails so with that logic maybe in 15
years
bubble nails will actually be really
cool yeah that's not likely I don't
really care what happens cuz in 15 years
I'll be super rolled out of style and
completely irrelevant I think my biggest
question about bubble nails is how do
you even make them like
it's not actually a piece of bubblegum
right I guess I could just search on
youtube how to make them
well I am thoroughly disgusted I'm no
nail tech but it looks like a bunch of
built-up acrylic nail resin gel
like layered and layered piled on your
nail that that can't be good for your
nails full disclosure I have zero idea
about any of that acrylic fake nail
stuff cuz we're a hundred percent
natural on this channel why do you want
to add a pound of plaster on top of your
nail it just seems like it's gonna weigh
it down and like rip it off look the
other hurting now oh don't worry I would
never do this to you but to make you
guys happy since you want me to try
bubble nails for some reason because you
like to see me torture myself I'm gonna
do it simply in a logical way and take
this tutorial literally you shall be on
my nail soon and then I will eat you
fahza so John Green ah yes victory is
mine boooo once uh Bubba go well at
least the cats are interchange
all right enough messing around okay we
got super important work to do here I'm
prepping my nails by applying my
favorite peel-off base coat so I can
take this crap off ASAP watch you mean
my nails are dirty because are yellow my
god no way you should watch this video
on yellow to know why they're actually
yellow all right past the gum oh look
I've got hollow on my other hand as per
usual look at all these balls it looks
like those children's play picks this
nail polish matches the green one hey
bluish purplish yellow I'm just gonna go
ahead and give myself a pat on the back
for that color coordination and then
paint each nail a different color
because we put different colors of
bubblegum on different fingers just for
fun let's start with the gumball
application on a pinky finger so if I
screw it up it'll matter less since I'm
obviously not going to glue gumballs to
my nails cuz that would be disgusting
I'm just gonna try using a really thick
coat of top coat yeah you don't got much
smarts today do you Christine or any
concept of physics let's try it on the
yellow because yellow is a brighter
color and happier so it'll probably work
I know let's cut the balls the blue
balls damn it oh don't do this guys it's
really dangerous to do this by your
nails oh look at me I have an idea bulb
floating over my head put her to the
microwave to make it soft oh yeah slice
that right down the middle of soft and
tender balls oh my god this is so
satisfying
it's almost as satisfying as peeling off
nail vinyls or simply peel or peeling
off your nail polish
Penelope love Facebook oh my god look at
all those equal halves of bubblegum
all right let's attack again I don't
care if you have a big dent in you I
don't got patience for that beautiful
looks just like the picture stood again
there we go one more time and another
time after that Oh would you just look
at that so gorgeous I mean look at that
side profile shot oh I just I love it I
love it I love it so much I can't bear
how much I love it oh I just love
playing in all of these balls I want all
of these balls on my fingers in my hands
everywhere oh and fell over and my pinky
okay
fashion shoot is over well now I know
how much of a struggle it is to live
your daily life with bubble nails I just
had a hell of a time trying to change
the camera lens and actually do things
with my fingers and you thought long
nails were impractical these are
definitely the most challenging nails
ever look I can't even pick my nose
these nails look like so much of a
deformity that I could probably go tell
my boss that I need to go on sick leave
because I have a temporary disability I
wonder how lesbians would feel happy
nice nails I was highly inappropriate
stopping this is YouTube not you porn I
feel like if Miranda sings went to a
nail salon this is what she would ask
for my meal done I'm going to sing now
bubbles that are attached my nails
better on my fingers it's on my arm
dear people who wear bubble nails I hate
to burst your bubble but these are done
this funny these nails are so
funny-looking they look like they belong
on clown except that clowns are really
scary a little me
I am the bubble monster I want to touch
you pretty girl I'm pretty sure now I
even have a phobia of those bubble
machines that you put 25 cents in no I
will not give you my corner that's about
it for these list tutorial I've got for
you today please remember to subscribe
to my channel for more useless shift
click the button somewhere I would click
it for you but I'd probably scared the
hell out of you I just realized this is
my first edible nail tutorial since when
was this kind of gum this sugary
I don't want to play anymore there's the
first time for everything and the last
time look who I've got for you it's not
men she it's her older brothers Alec
recent life is never here's cuz he hates
the camera actually he doesn't seem to
be minding it today what's wrong with
you oh there we go
eyes I'll ER then she what do you think
give me your honest opinion now if
you'll excuse me I have to get the
off my nails before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
