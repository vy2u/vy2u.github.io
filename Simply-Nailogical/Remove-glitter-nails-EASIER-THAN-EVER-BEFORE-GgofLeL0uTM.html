if you haven't already and you did these
awesome hollow glitter placement nails
wore them for a few days
line to the world Apollo and then you're
like how the do I get this off and the
thought of dissolving these thick
litters with acetone makes you want to
kill yourself and the solution is take
off these nails by backing up too before
you even put them on and by that I mean
use a peel-off base coat this is my
all-time favorite I've been using it for
almost a year now you can't find it at
any stores that you visit in person then
I know it but you can find it online at
this one link that I put down for you in
the video description box let's cover
the basics this is not your average
peel-off base coat it's not like Sally
Hansen it's not like OPI glitter off
it's not like NYC stripped me off and
it's definitely not like glue
in fact these four products on the
screen now all have one thing in common
and that's glue that's right OPI sally
hands in NYC are all glue based products
and there's a major difference between a
glue based peel off base coat and this
one I don't know what it is because I
don't know science but all I know is
that it definitely does not look like
glue doesn't smell like glue it is an
apply like glue it doesn't take forever
to dry like glue and it removes way
better than glue here's a super old clip
of me applying it on my nail
my nails are short and weigh less yellow
back then but as you can see it goes on
just like a normal clear base coat super
easy to apply all you need is one coat
goes on clear and it dries clear in less
than 2 minutes just like a regular base
coat not like blue which can take up to
10 minutes to fully dry after you let
the unmagical base coat dry on your
nails do your hollow glitter please this
is the super speed version but you can
watch the full version at the link in
the upper right hand corner so if you're
cool you probably want to keep these on
for like ever because I mean look at
them but in your heart you know that
this manis time is over it's time to
review your nails because you're
addicted to doing your nails I left
these on for two days and the peel off
base coat did not come off at all until
you make it come off that's also why I
love this base coat isn't come up until
you want it to come off it's like a
really good boyfriend that actually
listens to you the most effective way to
take it off and still take care of your
nails at the same time is to use a nail
oil first I use my favorite nail oil
that's bliss cos simply pure and I put a
couple links to that down below this is
one of their pen applicators but it also
comes in a bottle dropper thingy spread
that I'll write in around your cuticle
area and underneath your nail because
why not little hydration goes a long way
there's a mention here let it soak for
just a couple minutes just enough time
for the oil to get up in there take a
metal or plastic pair
I don't know whatever you call this tool
you're using a metal tool be careful not
to scratch your nail and very gently
lift up the big piece of polishing
glitter and it'll come off like a turtle
shell your turtle shells come off I
don't notice I'd even make sense in
nature look at that glitter placement
time capsule preserved in history
forever
yeah yeah my nails are yellow whatever
that's not the base code fault watch
this video let's watch it again just
gently gently poke it under around the
sides it's a little stuck in the corner
just be careful to do it very gently you
don't want to risk actually scraping
your nail and then BAM you just popped
off your glitter nail like no big deal
let's keep doing it this is fun and so
satisfying to watch oh this one is
turning out less satisfying I think a
lot of how well the peel off bases
actually come off your nail has a lot to
do with the natural shape of your nail
that you can't change and my pointer
finger is shaped like me to curve
compared to my other nails so for
whatever reason I always struggle with
getting off the peel off stuff off the
tip in my nail a little trickier but
when there's a will there's a way
just gently dig up in there and it'll
come off there you go yeah yellow nails
all over again
there's only bits of residue around the
very sides your nail and under your nail
but you would have naturally from
painting your nails like you're supposed
to do just take a q-tip dipped in a tiny
bit of acetone and wipe it right off and
the bonus is that you've already
hydrated your nails with nail oil - fun
fact this nail oil is pretty much the
only thing I use to care for my nails I
don't use strengtheners or hardeners or
any of that crap I just use nail oil for
more on how I grow my nails long strong
and healthy click the link in the video
description box on how to grow your
nails I definitely am going to make a
peel off base face off video kind of
like the same style I didn't
peel off stuff around the nail video
thing but this one is definitely my
favorite of all the ones I've ever tried
if you don't know now you know
kela and then you get to add your peel
off manicures into your collection of a
bunch peel off manicures that you keep
in a ziploc bag under your pillow you're
a psycho serial killer look at all these
panties do you recognize any of them
I just love peeling off my men isn't
saving them for later I don't really
know why maybe I'll make art with em he
knows
add it to the bag and you're the new
Dexter how lame where Dexter's blood
slide trophies and you see this bag
Blitzers this is trophy gold right here
i slayed all these many myself okay
that's enough crazy insane person for
all of us I'm gonna go to bed now
remember that unjust super hard to find
that I put the link down below for you
yet cuz I'm a nice person thanks so much
for watching guys please remember to
subscribe to my channel so you can tune
in when I have my peel off face face off
video and don't know why I'm talking in
this accent right now I'm just really
