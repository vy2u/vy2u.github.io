I'm Claire lives
your behavior got a lot to manage to
health why this trend it so do those two
generals don't do it why the point of
arson being a lot oh no Chris is wrong
sometimes I feel like I left a piece of
myself on Polish market what I must
return
okay Internet where the fuck did I leave
off on polish Mountain what do you got
for me 250 plus codes and a girl who and
her boyfriend did it kidding me
edible polish Mountain ooh

super polish mountain on a doll okay

100 coats of lipstick 100 coats of
mascara really 100 t-shirts 100 coats of
Korean kapustin apple and larch liqueur
Wow Tanya just small tow I can't read
that
polish Mountain is taking over the world
how am I gonna beat anyone well you know
what they say if you don't like the game
change the rules stretching out for the
next 12 hours but this time the clear
Edition let's do this bitch so I got
myself some glossy tacos that's top coat
for people who are new to this channel
you should subscribe now so you don't
miss other words I mispronounced got
myself this massive giant bottle of
quick dry taco refill I'm gonna start
off with my peel-off base coat obviously
and yes to maintain the true challenge
element of this video I'm still painting
with my office at hand stop shaking stop
it
next before I get started on the clear
polish Mountain I'm applying some bright
blue hollow because it's gonna be like
the bottom of the ocean how deep is your
Hollow
is it like the ocean rainbow in motion
yeah
I just sang that for the new people here
who haven't heard my remix before I
would fill the ocean with hollow if I
wouldn't get arrested for massive
pollution are we starting this that
early now I'm gonna need all the sugar I
can get ha ha ha ha ha thought it would
be cool if I used black light reactive
topcoat uh who do you guys see that look
at that clip yes time to build the ocean
Christine I am God
Nicole's hasn't been I just started I
can't even count that that low cloud of
tea thanks bets on my Twitter just now I
told everyone that I was filming
something for the next 12 hours were
just too predictable Christine the
apples were too healthy
I had to balance it out Manji yeah there
and she wanted to come to polish
mountain with me hey guys we're kind of
running into a dilemma even though
there's only blue at the very bottom no
matter which way I rotate it it just
looks like it's a shitload of blue I
don't think my experiments gonna work
does this mean I have to restart again
like last time all right I guess
everyone should get ready for some
premature peel porn
really gonna start now I'm a dedicated
polish mountain warrior oh fuck I think
I'm gonna leave the pinky on just as an
experiment and we'll keep building it up
clear we go again the other ones not
like the other ones not like the other
ones who's texting me would you stop
trying to taught me natalie topcoats
getting a little stringy nail polish
God's trying to get back at me for doing
something so stupid
that's woman this is not smart this is
really not smart no this is not smart

blown your mind is blowing up into tiny
pieces right now do you know how Moses
