friendly neighborhood Canadian nail
artist you may have watched my last
video revealing the secrets that Russian
nail arts will hate me for revealing in
any case I'm fully aware that I messed
up and put the Russian nail art
techniques to shame I'm so sorry so
sorry I couldn't do it like you since
you guys are super supportive but my
Canadian mutt identity wasn't born with
any Russian nail artist genes I decided
I'd take a second stab at this cause
here in Canada we ain't got no shame I'm
not afraid to show the world that I mess
up and we can all have a laugh and have
a gale town together and now I have
unlocked the secret of Russian nail art
no those aren't you known as hands
they're actually mine silly all right
all right let's do this
I'm applying my first coat of a mint
green polish and letting my cuticles
like it's my job before we unlock the
master secret here's what I did wrong on
my pinky finger I used an actually good
highly pigmented black nail polish and
it didn't pull so well and spread
because it's a good nail polish that's
the kicker just wait for it let's talk
about tools for a second here so this is
like a water marbling tool or a tiny
tiny dotting tool whatever you want to
call it and that's what I originally saw
Sveta and some other Russians using when
they do their water marbles or drag
marbles or any of that stuff so I tried
it and it didn't work out because I kept
scraping through the Polish and
good so I got to think maybe using a
thin striping brush would work better
than a hard metal tool for us North
Americans who don't know how to do their
nails properly in the last video people
seem to think that I forgot that there's
any other country in the world besides
Canada America and Russia I'm fully
aware that there's other countries in
the world to be honest I pretty much
group everyone in Europe Australia Asia
all of those other continents that
aren't North America in the same group
as Russians because y'all are amazing
and I don't know how you do it
which means I'm pretty much just
insulting Canadians and Americans oh
wait um well if you're Canadian you
won't be offended because you're totally
cool and you laugh at anything and if
you're American then well I hope you ate
a serving of humor for dinner you didn't
hear anything I just said did you know
you didn't because you were distracted
by the hollow which is just a backboard
that I bought at Walmart that I put
underneath my tripod setup thing now pay
attention let's get back to work I'm
applying a very thick second coat
because you need it to be thick and wet
for the next part to work
don't let this drag on don't let it drag
in the comments of my last video a lot
of you guys said I was doing it wrong
because I let the base polish dry is
there something you know that I don't
because I'm pretty sure I left it wet so
here's the trick the polish you drop in
has got to be a shitty polish this is
Revlon's blackest black and it's not
black at all it's like a navy blue
that's really translucent and really
jelly and has a bit of shimmer in' and
this is like the furthest thing from
blackest black
come on revlon know your stuff look at
that that's like two coats this is black
milk this is disgusting we all know if
my distaste for white milky polishes on
my nails but black milk that's a whole
new level of milk but because it's so
shitty and sheer it actually bleeds
super well into the base wet polish just
pretend I didn't Segway off the
discussion of of how bad this polishes
and work quickly do your green base
first then drop your crappy jelly polish
in next
take a thin paintbrush if you prefer and
use that to make some kind of a design
with the balls holy cow your mind is
blown I don't know what this is it kind
of just looks like melting hearts but
this was my first attempt guys aren't
you proud of me and my first attempt I
mean when I like seven teeth after my
last video this make sure you give the
Polish at least 15 minutes to fully dry
and then seal that brush imperfection in
with a glossy top coat or matte top coat
whatever topic you want I don't care
it's not the same design of Sveta's
original drag marble witchcraft magic
and I think I could get there with
practice if I live another 200 years but
I don't care we all know I'm going back
to gradients and nail vinyls anyways oh
hey there I'm sorry did you think I was
a real Russian nail vlogger
my hand pose must have fooled you too
because I'm from North America I'm going
to ruin this with glitter not hollow
glitter this time but I thought it'd be
fun to try this iridescent topper polish
looks like the dandruff of a unicorn
Darce action better close the door of
your parents or home
take your thin small brush and just wipe
it all over that Russian magic if
anything I think this just complements
the witchcraft I mean I don't believe
anything is supernatural unless it
sparkles anyways add another topcoat to
seal it all in and that was probably my
most conservative use of glitter ever
bookmark this video because you won't
see it again and yeah now my nails are
looking pretty sophisticated actually
they're pretty much office appropriate
in fact they're kind of elegant and
classy oh I don't know how I feel about
this anymore
I'm not sure I can be comfortable with
this manicure guys well I think the
moral of the story here is don't try to
be something you're not that includes
trying to be Russian on your nails you
got to do what you love people and if
you love just doing gradients and using
nail vinyls and putting holo glitter on
everything and anything and never doing
any freehand stuff ever and that's
completely okay because the nail art
community accepts you for who you are
alright I'm gonna go take these off my
nails before I have an identity crisis
see you guys next time bye
