complicated gradient nails for you today
just ignore that long elaborate name I
have down at the bottom because in truth
I really had no idea what to call these
let's get started since we're working
with me on best to add a white base coat
first you can watch my what's the best
white polish video and see which one was
the best next up you're going to take
some simply peel that you just refilled
and apply it around your nails to
protect from gradient messes my videos
are so predictable
when did I not use these same exact
clips watch the completely useless how
to refill your simply peel video up in
the right hand corner it's pretty much
the story of what would happen if I
actually went into teaching as a career
I'm using an overkill army of neon
polishes and I can't remember their name
so you can just look at the description
box below where I will have written them
on a makeup sponge I apply my first two
colors and I kind of went for a somewhat
monochromatic look her nails the middle
nail you'll be seeing is the lucky
Orange slash coral now I'm focusing the
sponging of the gradient towards the
base of the nail because this is one
half of the two-part scaled gradient
this neon is literally murdering Mike
him let's adjust something a little
better now a lot of these words I say
probably won't make any sense you can
pretty much just tune me out and look at
what I'm doing build up the opacity by
applying two to three coats of spongy
neon this don't worry about coloring the
entire nail because the tip of the nail
won't matter you'll see next
get in Mac tweezers when you're done
your first of four gradients take your
tweezers and peel off simply peel like
no big deal there we go little to no
mess left behind whatsoever I love it
and find simply peel at the links below
the video description box you don't have
it then you're not a real nail artist
apply a quick dry top coat and this will
be the first of a ridiculous number of
top codes that I will be applying in
this tutorial let it dry for a good 15
to 20 minutes because we're going to use
nail vinyls next I can't count how many
times I've said that exact same sentence
I got these Chevron nail vinyls from
twinkle t-dot-com you can use my code
simply for 10% off yay look I get you
free money back and I'm putting it
halfway down the nail and I'm applying
simply peel around the edges because
we're going to do a gradient on the top
half of the nail that's right so we're
going to mask off the bottom half and
we're doing a gradient on the top half
of the ship so I could use simply peel
to cover up that space that you see I'm
covering with green tape kind of like
how I did in my blood drip mani but I
don't know I was just lazy and I just
wanted to use a piece of tape okay
sometimes I change things up save the
environment recycle your sponges cut it
off for a nice clean edge now for this
episode of sponge action I'm going to
paint it on in a triangular shape I'm
doing this to kind of match the shape of
the gradient that I want to project onto
my nail that you can see upside down now
it's right side up laughs words refill
your sponge another two to three times
depending on how good your polishes are
being
hey you can kind of go on each side of
the chevron if you want that probably
would have been an easier way to get a
nice even fade going on but I like to
take the hard way in life peel off your
green painters tape like no big deal see
what I've been there
heal off the simply feel a little bit
you got hanging on the edges and then
finally peel off your Chevron to reveal
a beautiful scaled gradient what you
have in front of you ladies and
gentlemen is one of the original scaled
gradients that you saw for me in my old
videos that no one used to watch because
they were really boring and I didn't
talk add your second quick dried topcoat
things are getting interesting these are
some thick striped nail vinyls I got
from Plainville teeth and they're just
the right amount of sticky to get me a
nice clean line you can kind of use
these stripes for all sorts of things
not just stripes so here I'm using them
to make an X shape because I'm going to
do a gradient over the top half of nail
so you'll kind of see an X revealed when
I go to peel them off this probably
makes no sense to you at this point
you're like what are you doing you're
just putting more nail vitals on your
nails and then doing more gradients it
makes no sense that's okay you know what
it didn't make any sense to me while I
was doing it most the time I don't know
what the hell I'm doing sometimes it
turns out and sometimes it doesn't but
you've got to have fun with it girl
using Tamar green painters tape at the
bottom of my nail I'm doing the triangle
gradient business again challenges are
fun AB dab dab on the nail this time
it's the opposite direction of the one
you saw directly under it which makes
the top half of the nail now a
reciprocal gradient on top of a scale
gradient to see how that work no no no
you don't okay
peel everything off because peeling is
fun
guess what add another topcoat that's
number three if you're counting make
sure to let it dry again if you don't
listen to this step then you will mess
up your nail and undo all of your work
I'm using the stripe nail vinyls to mask
off the top of the nail and focus my
attention on the bottom so I want to
fill the chevron gap that I've created
right here and I'm going to fill it with
a gradient that's going the opposite
direction of the one underneath it tape
off everything do the triangle business
again sponge it on the nail dab dab dab
lots of dab and today it should dab on
you got it after this mani will
officially be the world's greatest
dabber
heel off everything for the last time
but don't breathe while you're peeling
this off because if you peel it off and
it rips up the base coat or otherwise
messes up this manicure you will have
just wasted five hours of your life okay
I can breathe now it doesn't look like a
disaster
add another topcoat because what's one
more at this point and that's the final
effect and to be honest it wasn't really
as striking as I imagined in my head
this is my doodle paper that I did at
work
I guess if I is darker or more
contrasting colors it probably would
have had a cooler effect whatever to
help bring out the pattern a bit I
decided to add some black acrylic paint
picked it up from my local craft store
and poured it out on a Greek yogurt lid
container I'm going to use a striping
brush to make some thin black lines and
one trick that I've mentioned before in
one of my ancient historical videos with
no voiceovers on how to make your
paintbrush line smoother it's just to
dip it in a little bit of oil and then
wipe off the excess oil I say that and
then my lines aren't smooth of course
honestly I don't know how people film
these tiny freehand detail things that
require a steady hand on camera because
first of all my hand ain't study and
second of all I keep blocking the camera
if it's going to be good and if I'm not
blocking the camera that I can't paint
thank God for toothpicks in one of my
recent videos on how to pretend you can
paint I'll show you how using a
toothpick to pick off all your mistakes
and acrylic paint it's probably the best
thing ever invented
honestly free handing lines the worst
thing ever I'm too reliant on a line on
something like a nail vinyl addict I
can't go cold turkey
I just live without you now again I'll
do the best you can not like me on
camera here do what I say and not what I
do don't block the camera like this
either if you're making tutorials
finally put on your final top coat this
is number five of five I'm using a matte
top coat because I thought it would look
cool with the jnanis going on
look it's matte now that looks cooler
than the one without the lines
personally I think a little more
striking you're probably thinking to
yourself but at this point that was way
too much effort for this like no one is
going to go do their nails with four
gradients and 5-million top coats for
seven hours that's not happening and
that's totally fine okay I did it for
you so you can spare yourself the time
and effort of doing this which probably
isn't even worth it you're welcome
now go paint a boring Datuk here on your
nail thanks so much anyways for seeing
this video
through and realizing you're never going
to do this nail-art ever then she loves
you either way see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
