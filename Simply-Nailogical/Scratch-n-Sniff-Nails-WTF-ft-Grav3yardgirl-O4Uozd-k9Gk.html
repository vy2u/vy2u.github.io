male logical videos that I put on my
second channel I got this scratch and
sniff nail art kit thing what I guess
you have to scratch it first thank you
to Jen and your daughter on Tennessee
for sending this to me this nail art
claims to have scented nail patches that
smell like fruit an actual product may
not be exactly as shown I'm a little
skeptical about this but there is one
way we can find out does this thing
really work does this thing really warn
of this thing really or oh my god hey oh
I wish wait wait wait wait can I come
like from here oh yeah oh that's even
creepier
I can't visible but not my in Charlie
doesn't make sense consider your alone
again
so bunny I have a question for you does
this thing really work we're here to
find out I flew all the way from Canada
to Texas you're welcome very important
business we're doing here I know you had
to take two flights not one but two
foreign totaled things I do for nails
and you yeah so we're here with bunny
from graveyard girl which you probably
already know but in case you don't now
you should so this is apparently scratch
and sniff nail art stickers I really
want to know though is it the Polish
because the Polish heaven has fruits on
it so it probably smells or stickers
you're not gonna just illegal ways no oh
well by the way it says right here three
scented nail polishes 25 video how does
through the instruction
oh my god something I never do that's
what words are on the box floor how do
you know I'm glad I could help
okay oh yeah yeah now we know they're
gonna work and if they don't we can
control ourselves with Hollow these
models are so cute they look like like
little Lego people so whatever our
possible sense strawberries oh look
curry this must be a nail file that's a
great sound I don't like those kinds of
files
hopefully I mark a smell and tell me if
it works this smells like nail-polish
 but the more you smell it so it has
like an aftertaste
yeah after smell mine smells like rotten
grapes and formaldehyde great dead
bodies that smells the same as the
muffin cupcake right this is like a hint
of trying to be Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this
little al volunteer one of my nails not
volunteer sacrifice one of my nails look
I'll do it over hollow that sounds what
color do you want
do I get to paint your nail yeah is that
the honor that I get pay my middle
finger I want that one to stand okay
thank me thank me bunny
oh it's like wall it's got a real weird
texture also not good at this so if I
pick my nose after this and I'm just
gonna smell weird about me like
there's only way to find out do it yeah
this coverage is not so good I would say
it's not opaque in one coat also not
opaque in two codes actually are making
it worse because you're supposed to let
it dry you've never been to polish
Mountain know it what's so funny I
always say deagle what what do you mean
decoe these are nailed Eagles link
stickers oh wait
bar bother you topping at now not D then
because I just Canada other duckin no
carry on pound crowd were you dropped on
this but it is so sassy this is probably
all bad footage I'm the worst guest
guest person on your channel we're both
guests because this is not my place if
you didn't notice I'm not in my nail
room and it's the lighting and
everything is terrible it's cuz we're in
a hotel room trying to make this work
there oh I forgot my nails what and I
put more layers huh she was touch it to
find out oh not dry look now you have
our chunky clump that's how I like it

these maybe we'll have better luck with
our noses for this ooh it peeled oh we
have to scratch them okay I want to find
out what anger smells like well look you

shiny shines hey am i just like putting
my nose hey here's a good sounds my
finger smells like strawberries anger

this one this is my life ok she's
getting picky look I'm just sticking on
the Eagle and your nails are way too
short for it wait don't you fold it over

videos I was go see y'all later back
no that's Texan that is it I have no
idea where it came from I just started
saying yeah where'd you get y'all TV so
easy it's so easy this does really work
ok we've reached a conclusion that
wasn't the test the test is if they
smell
I do I mean bad is still smell that's
true my nails have never been more good
good Wow
yeah I got to pick another complementary
color I'm thinking um I really like this
thing honestly I was thinking now and
kind of looks like you that does look
like me like crazy yeah I was gonna be
on the cover of a magazine or something
you know like a child's magazine it
doesn't work
it didn't peel off oh hi cliff I need
you to be in all my videos so that I can
just make all the devices work why is it
working so well beautiful see this is
Glenn I made this is the best nail art
you've ever done really I kind of agree
with you and I think most people out

good I'm here I could put one on line
too so we can be like right now right of
it folded my nails you gotta see it's
not sticking flag yeah I'm just so good

nails and then perfect okay

your professional conclusion on this
product I do have to say they are art
this is art it's quite artistic and
designs ever came up with and it does
smell it doesn't promise you right I
smell good that's right now it says it's
got smell isn't it - honestly like a
stiff they're funny to me they're really
cute they are cute but I don't feel like
they would last not let go showered no I
wish they were more like they were

package that was dig get in your life I
did the conclusion is buy it try it
liver diet I wish it I didn't like nice
beer or what about like Mexican like
