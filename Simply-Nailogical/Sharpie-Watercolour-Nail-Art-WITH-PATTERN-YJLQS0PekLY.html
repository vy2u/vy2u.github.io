use Sharpie permanent markers for well
another use they're not supposed to be
used for you know what I'm talking about
drawn tattoos on your arms a Sharpie
markers in class you know so if these
look familiar they are familiar but I
used a completely different technique
this time than I did with my last ones
start off by painting your nails white
because color show a best on white
imagine that add a quick dry top coat
because we're gonna add nail vinyls but
even more than that you want to create a
nice seal on your nails so that the
Sharpie egg thing does cool things on
top of it you look at all these sharpies
I probably bought them one day Anna
staples when I had no actual use for all
these colors though I get one color when
you can get the rainbow you're also
gonna need some alcohol no not that kind
of alcohol you silly drunk people I use
rubbing alcohol compound and if it says
isopropyl alcohol alcohol I think I'm
drunk I can't even speak then it's
probably the same thing so it's still
good what's in this stuff anyways
ethanol and hydrous I don't remember
grade 10 chemistry I'm sorry mrs. Sam D
you're gonna need some little container
things that can be glass or plastic and
I have no idea why even have these I
just found them under my bathroom
counter and then the idea is that you're
gonna use it as a container that holds
your colored dye so take your permanent
marker just one color per cup scribble
it all around the container thingy and
take a random brush you don't care about
cuz I don't know what's gonna happen to
it dip it in the alcohol and then put it
in the cup now I haven't tested this yet
the shot you're seeing right now is the
first time I actually did this so I
don't even know what I'm doing but I
just painted it on paper to see what was
happening and like I think that's how
it's supposed to be working I don't know
I got a better idea
cuz y'all know how much I love yogurt
people always ask me how much yogurt I
eat because I seem to have a clean fresh
yogurt lid and every day
and yeah the answer is I eat a whole
lotta yogurt you can use any plastic lid
container it doesn't have to be yogurt
basically if it doesn't absorb the
Sharpie ink then you're probably good
the more you scribble the more ink
you'll get all right let's try this
again dip my brush in alcohol and spread
it all over the yogurt lid container
yeah this is definitely more fun than a
little cup thing I don't know why maybe
it's because I have a bigger surface
area to make a mess I'm not sure more
colors
yes I don't know why or what I'm doing
it I'm just testing guys but it's gonna
work so you should also do this and have
fun before you start your nail art
because it's very satisfying look at
that I even made purple now watch what
happens when I add even more alcohol
into the Sharpie egg this is where you
start to see that really cool watercolor
effect because it kind of pools and
separates and almost looks like bacteria
under a microscope I don't know it's got
this cool outline thing going on when I
try and experiment with it I am a genius
yes perfect perfect excellent let's
begin so I could just take all these
different colors of Sharpie ink and put
them randomly like blobs all over my
nail but that's kind of boring to be
honest and that's been done before so
instead we're gonna put the Sharpie ink
over nail vinyls because nail vinyls are
the pinnacle of creativity so you have
seen this concept done before when I did
my mermaid watercolor nails but that was
using acrylic paint and once you dilute
acrylic paint with water the colors are
going to be less saturated but before we
begin we got to protect our cuticles
with some simply peel good stuff link
it's always in the video description box
below because if we don't do this and
the Sharpie egg is going to get all up
in our cuticles and we're going to have
permanently colored we our cuticles and
it won't be a good look you're probably
thinking I made a huge mess on my
blackboard aren't you ah the beauty of
liquid latex I love it after the simply
peel is on we got to peel up our nail
vinyls and apply them on our nails and
sometimes I miss a few little thingies
in between but I just put it on the
reverse side of a Nelvana and bam all
the spaces are out and we're ready to go
the beauty of these nail vinyls is that
you can use whatever pattern you want
and you won't have had to drawn it on
your
I'm using diamonds here but there's also
heart designs and mermaid vinyls and
maracas and vinyls and all these other
kinds of vinyls and there's so much
selection at twinkle tea as always the
link is below for my favorite nail vinyl
store and you can use my code simply for
10% off whatever you buy oh yeah I was
cutting around the sides of the vinyl to
make it fit my nail a bit better because
my nails are quite curved make sure the
vinyl is pressed down super firmly to
the nail this is important
otherwise the Sharpie ink stuff is going
to leak under the vinyl which did happen
to me anyways but whatever and now you
can revert to your child self and take
out that frustration of being told by
your parents to not scribble all over
the walls and then drink some alcohol
did I say drink I meant to take some
alcohol and then put it on the Sharpie
ink and then you're going to take your
alcohol soaked Sharpie ink and put it
all over your nails on top of the vinyls
what a great combination of chemicals to
be sniffing in the fumes I then took
some more alcohol end of it with the
pink and started making things purple
yes oh it's like a gradient all of a
sudden then I added some pink sharpie on
my nails but I did use a different brush
because I wasn't sure if my blue brush
would be stained by the permanent blue
sharpie ink it turns out you can wash
Sharpie in COFF of acetone but I found
that out later now the coolest part
about using vinyls for this technique is
not just that you're going to have
colored diamond shapes it's that the
more alcohol and Sharpie ink you add in
between each little vinyl shape the more
of an outline shape effect you're going
to get my impression is that this
happens because the ink kind of pools
around the edges of each shape but I
don't know science or mixing or
something when you're done you're messy
masterpiece just peel off the vinyl to
reveal that beautiful effect then peel
off your simply peel like no big deal
and yes I realized it kind of bled a
little at the tip of my nail so to kind
of clean that up you can just take a
cleanup brush I'm using my favorite ones
from twinkle tea a super skinny thin one
that's going to fit just nicely
in-between those diamond shapes dip the
brush in a little bit of acetone and
then just outline the shapes to kind of
clear up that sharpie ink that what
and between the diamonds oops so you
think we're done and you think naturally
the next step has to be that we put top
coat on it but wait don't do it because
this is why I put a regular glossy top
coat on my pinky finger and it majorly
desaturated the colors see look what
happens look at that science what's
happening why is doing that I don't know
don't you worry hallo to the rescue yeah
look at that that's a new holo top good
I just got and it's not diluting
now you've often seen me use fun
lacquers diamond hollow taco but I
figured for this design I wanted the
hollow to be a little bit more dispersed
so I can see a little more of the color
because we are painting it over a
lighter colored design yeah yeah I know
you want to see a comparison and a
hollow topcoat war don't worry it's in
the plans everyone like I say for every
other video so now I know that this
hollow topcoat is not gonna ruin the
color of my Sharpie ink I just put one
thin coat on my nails and bam now I'm a
hollow sharpie I wouldn't be so upset if
these nails actually turned out to be
permanent now after you've added the
hollow topcoat and let it dry then it's
safe to put on a glossy top coat to help
seal off the nail and make it super
shiny so basically the moral of the
story is that you need a hollow topcoat
to protect you from all bad things in
the world except for you pinky but you
did martyr yourself for the well-being
of all my other nails so we thank you
for your service actually now that I
think about it the way the pinky turned
out kind of reminds me of how acrylic
paint watercolor technique turns out
less saturated but I guess it depends on
the kind of looks you're going for for
me personally I want more colors and
more Hollow
hope you enjoyed this look guys now I'm
off to eat some more yogurt see you next
time bye
