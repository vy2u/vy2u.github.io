again and i'm still here so many of you
guys have been asking me to try out this
DIY nail polish gift that we've seen
around on social media lately even the
experts at BuzzFeed try to know I do
like nail polish but tbh I don't wear it
that often and that's why I left
BuzzFeed and I see you guys all up in
the comment section of these videos
what's the point if there's no high oh
well that's right girl that's right and
of course I had to get one so we can put
the nail back in simply no logical just
you guys know this company actually
reached out to me and wanted to give me
a code and shit but I didn't want
anything at all time me to some kind of
positive review because let's be honest
so notice for this video I might be
simply sad that are logical simply
savage logic but the company was nice
enough to help me get it to Canada cuz
right now you can only get it shipped to
the state why does everybody got it
forget about us Canadians eh
what are we do wrong whatever it is
we're sorry anyways maybe they're kind
of regret that they helped me get it
here we'll see open her up sooo fun for
the whole family
I am currently holding back from making
mass amounts of drug jokes so what do we
have here where we got open one of the
nail polish bottles containing the clear
base blah blah no blood dump the colour
in the bottle and mix the shit up using
the mixer what color should we make
first kid how about we try and match my
eye shadow Oh No what should I do
should I take the red pill or the blue
pill I know that's a very political
thing now don't make a joke about that
what the matrix started that yeah it's
okay from the nature Tilley they
co-opted that
you got I'm the most effective way to
get the drugs kids so this is what we're
gonna do
you see you don't want to waste your
drugs I'm not sure I saved us any time
here and get in the bottle either all
right well let's try mixing it before it
gets too full oh you need batteries
where's the off button this is the
beginning of robots taking over the
world I don't understand shut up Scott
all right here goes nothing we must
perform an extraction what can you
believe that there is something more
annoying than my channel doesn't even
like stick in then it's been cereal now
make it stop
like phrase like a nail polish milkshake
maker
and here's what we got curly not so
saturated pale reddish pinky color let's
just add half a capful of black and I
think the only way to do this without
it's burning everywhere is to put the
mixer directly in the nail-polish first
and then put battery on there we go see
that's simply logical well I didn't make
it that much darker it just looks like
it has black little freckles and you
know this isn't the first time I've made
my own nail polish Anthony I thoroughly
enjoyed that experience
so now my lobster the fog zakat there
collects pretty is darker kind of got a
Coachella dust party going on here just
ignore that well that not really black
what's next what's next how about we add
some of the white stuff I wonder what
would happen if someone actually tried
to cross the border with this man polish
kid oh no officer this is just nail
polish pigments not cocaine this shit is
so messy is this for children not bad
actually like this one the best so far
and look it's like my fingers are
sporting some serious highlight
muted I see purple but still purple
recessed to the dance little buddy
not really as gold as I would have
played but oh my god we haven't talked
about what's on my hand it's a nail
polish that I didn't make myself that's
why it looks so amazing let's evaluate
shall we I was kind of expecting more
vibrant colors than these I mean they're
okay but we've seen better it kind of
looks similar to the same result you
would get by mixing eyeshadow and clear
nail polish and either way you tend to
end up with this kind of unsaturated
pearly finish and although this kit came
with six different shades of pigment
that you can mix to make different
colors they're all going to give you the
same kind of shimmery pearlescent finish
you can't really change the intensity of
the color either beyond the way the raw
pigment appears I mean look at this
swatch wheel on their website that's
pretty much the ring and it's all
unsaturated / leaf is this kit even
worth it if you happen to like the
pearly nail polish finish its 39.95 us
for the kit and they give you six
bottles which makes it 666 per bottle oh
my god it's a devil I get it I get it
okay it's fun because you made it
yourself and you feel special I mean
maybe this could be a fun activity for
children I don't know about this so
unlike the experts over at BuzzFeed I'm
not mad at the color and I am mad at it
you know why because it's not oh oh
don't you worry cuz we're gonna fix that
bring me the holo I got it I got it
hahaha alright let's start with this
basic stitch gold polish
right oh yeah buddy
oh it's overflowing oh yeah look at that
nail porn it seems good because the
BuzzFeed experts also showed their
appreciation for nail harm drip drop
drip drip buddy drop looks better still
kind of understated hollow but you know
maybe you could wear it when your
family's in town
just put some pink color glitter just
because I'm in an experimental mood
we're going to add some of this linear
silver hollow pigment and see if that
actually makes the base more holographic
as opposed to just adding glitter it's
actually not so bad now for this blue
how about we add some aqua turquoise
hallelujah
what do we think I think it could use
some some more Hollow
well shit that actually looks kind of
cool finally something I may actually
want to put on my nails well you know
what I'm going to do with this guy we're
going to make you look like black hollow
wit bitch let's add some tiny black
color glitter then some bigger black
hollow and last we're going to go a
little wild by adding some giant black
hollow glitters because you only live
once and then you die
damn girl that looks good isn't it
amazing that with just a dash of hollow
things in life can be made better after
this purple let's just add a shitload of
different types of silver holo keep it
classy you know move over make room for
the holo
all right well I'd say it's gone up a
level though I'm not really sure what
level it was on when it started out
after this last one I think I'm going to
go a little more traditional mermaid and
then going to add some white iridescent
glitters and some bigger mermaid
glitters I just kind of think this one
doesn't need hollow because it's already
got like a mermaid
iridescent spot to it you know what I'm
saying all right what do we think
what's that Hollow they're much better
the subtle Hollow shining through so now
they don't look so bad in the bottle too
let's see how this watch you'll have to
excuse me my hands and fingers are
completely covered in the side effects
of making your own nail polish I have
nail polish spit up all over my shirt -
we should probably clean up this coke
party though you guys ever wonder what's
in my vacuum pretty hard to get huh but
first it's time for some peel porn oh
that's right baby
you weren't even expecting that today
but you gettin it anyways I will admit
the peel porn is a little cringy today
but that's only because I couldn't oil
up because the stupid fucking powder is
in everywhere
and now we got a pilla bass ghost so I
cannot feel porn to myself later
damn girl look at that nail leg she's
coming back strong I'm still waiting for
my nails to grow back a bit longer so
that they're super long when I show you
guys how to grow Eunice
I'll also be traveling to America
towards the end of June for VidCon when
I give back from that then I'm going to
start filming how to grow your nails so
please be patient it should be up within
a couple months try not to break a nail
until then let's try the purple ah
yeah I wouldn't say this is my favorite
formula alright mermaid green let's see
if you look any better that is kind of
nasty why is this so like sick see this
one's smoother what about blue food
Newtons I only have one free nail left
and I think I'm going to try the pink
and the gold
and you can barely see that all right
second coat all right let's evaluate the
purple is kind of Smith let's call it
generic grape purple the green is
honestly pretty tragic it looks like a
mermaid threw up on my fingernail so we
shall call it mermaid Samet or mer balm
for short the black actually looks good
I'm impressed
I mean I'm pretty confident that the
hollow saved it you let me know if you
think otherwise and then leave the color
of the blue is nice I like the tsiyon
kind of depth to it but the hollow
glitters are covered by the pigment
itself so you can't really see the
critter Sparkle we shall call you blue
that could have been better and last we
got this now is dusty kind of Moby cutie
pink so we shall call it pink in the
stink
well what do you know the ugly ones are
still ugly and now if you'll excuse me
tbh I need to go paint my nails properly
LOL r.i.p Andy here's a word of simply
advice if you want to make your own
hollow by actual nail polish at the
drugstore like if you can still buy
cheaper nail polish $2 $6 whatever it's
totally fine just get colors you like
and then save just a little bit more
money and buy a hollow taco you can't
find some hollow tacos in the drugstore
but there's much better selection from
indie brands and what you do is you just
put a hollow taco over whatever color
nail polish you want is BAM yo nails a
hollow now you know me if you don't like
the way your nails look put a hollow
tackle on you don't like your grade just
put a hollow taco on it you got a hater
mood a hollow taco on them you don't
like your life just put a hollow taco on
it alright I'm gonna go put a hollow
taco on myself now thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
