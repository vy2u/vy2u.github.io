inspired by the snuff trap if you follow
me on Instagram then you'll have seen me
post about it a lot and if you don't
follow me on Instagram then why aren't
you following me on Instagram snaps is
basically just a virtual way to organize
your stuff I use it for nail polish but
you can use it for anything really from
your watch collection to your soft
collection just storing pictures of your
bars soap if you really want to or
pictures of ancient cellphones if that's
the kind of thing you're into hey
there's mine now you know a mold snupps
works on a cloud so you can log into
your collection from wherever you are
and never accidentally buy the same
nail-polish ever again onto the nails
I'm using color club's french tip white
nail polish as opposed to your average
crappy milky white nail polish and I do
this because it's much creamier and it
goes opaque in about one coat but I just
have to switch the brush out with a
regular size brush because the French
tip nail-polish brushes are often too
skinny I'm going to make some simple
orange shelves inspired by the snaps app
which lets you organize your collection
or items onto shelves so I just use a
striping brush and create some little
abstract shelf like things so I'm using
this wide angled brush which I think
you're supposed to use for one stroke so
yeah it's not really working that well
with nail polish but now I know so I'm
just kind of messily filling it in with
a striping brush moving on playing
orange is boring me let's add some
glitter I use my loose iridescent
sparkly glitter from twinkle tea don't
forget to use my code simply for 10% off
your entire order for placing the
glitters I apply a little bit of clear
polish not top coat because top coat
dries too fast
to one little section of the shelves at
a time to pick up the loose glitters I'm
just using a toothpick and tons of
people ask me but how is the toothpick
actually picking up the glitter it's not
working for me the magical secret is you
just have to lick it that's right just
lick the tip of the toothpick ladies
just do one little section
out of time and keep adding a little bit
of that clear polish as you go I'm
painting on this little plus sign with
white acrylic paint and a striping brush
adding a topcoat will seal everything in
including those loose glitters just make
sure you add it on really thick and that
you're not pushing too hard down on the
brush or else you'll let the glitters
potentially move around like I did right
here oops on my thumb now I've got the s
art of the snaps logo and that one was
just way too hard to film so awkward to
film your thumb trust me and now I'm
just gonna add a picture of Mechi to my
snaps account just because I can you can
find me on the snap zap my username is
simply no logical one-word who woulda
guessed it leave me a comment and let me
know are you using the snaps app are you
saving yourself from buying a nail
polish dupe thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
