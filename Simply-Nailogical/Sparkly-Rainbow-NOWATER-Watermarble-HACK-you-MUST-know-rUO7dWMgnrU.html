new intro Christine some of those are
from my very own brand-new collaboration
collection I put the link down below
they are available now all right now
today we're gonna be making these super
bright and colorful and sparkly and
everything awesome in life rainbow water
marble nails but - the tragic
experiences of actually water marbling
in a cup because we all know how much I
hate that start off by applying a
peel-off base coat because we're gonna
peel them off at the end of the video
stay tuned next apply a liquid latex
barrier around your nail so we can
protect ourselves from glitter sponging
apply a thin coat of your favorite
silver hollow glitter and put the link
to my favorite down below add the
glitter to a makeup sponge and sponge
the rest onto your nail this will give
you maximum glitter payoff when you're
done simply peel off simply feel like no
big deal to remove your mess now while
we let that glitter set why don't we
play a game I've been sponsored to tell
you guys about yeah I'm probably not the
first person on YouTube to tell you this
but best fiends is a really fun and
highly addictive puzzle adventure game
where you build a team of tiny heroes to
defeat this looks I heard a rumor that
the slugs don't like hollow so they must
be destroyed the goal is that you gotta
match items that are the same color and
look and then it shoots a bunch of stuff
at those hollow hating slugs then you
can grow your little monster guy
character things so they become more
powerful and unlock hidden powers I'm
aggro you Edward I'm aggro you make you
big and strong best fiends has over 500
levels wet and the app is updated every
three weeks with new levels I'm already
on level 37 because I spent a lot of
time waiting for my nails to dry best
fiends is kicking off the summer with a
special gift on Sunday May 29th so make
sure to download best fiends and play on
May 29th to unlock your gift if you
don't already have it you can download
best fiends for free on the App Store or
Google Play at the link below in the
video description box did you guys even
notice that you just watched an ad or
were you distracted by the holo I know
your holo priorities people don't lie to
me hope you guys don't mind that
sponsorship I
saving up to buy a hollow car after all
the next part is the water marble part
it's really easy because we're just
gonna cheat at it and my how to cheat at
water marble part five I showed you guys
how to steal a water marble image from
the internet I am such a good influence
on children this is actually the same
water marble design from the nail artist
SIA gala except I decided to play with
it in Photoshop and see what other funky
colors I could create why didn't this
occur to me before I don't know so when
you've adjusted the colors to something
that you think you want on your nails
then all you got to do is copy that
image and paste it into a Word document
and then print it out on your printer
but remember it must be printed on
special paper it's called waterslide
decal paper decal this kind of paper is
typically used for figurines and hobby
crafts and such but the one that I found
on Amazon actually works really well for
your nails and I put the link to that
exact one that I got down below in video
description box after letting your
printed water marble set for about ten
minutes you're going to take a clear
nail polish not a topcoat but it clear
nail polish and just cover the entire
design this is essentially what's gonna
turn your water marble into it stickers
that you can put right on your nail let
that fully dry for probably at least 20
minutes and we never talked about what's
on my other hand oh my god if I were a
vampire I would wear this nail polish
every day who are we kidding I'm pale
and I never leave the house I'm
basically a vampire this is a gorgeous
blood cranberry red dark purple eggplant
color it's a linear holographic polish
and I put the link for it below ok so
many links today next it's time to cut
up your stolen water marble into little
pieces that will fit your nail when
you're done cutting up all your DIY
decals into a shape that's a little bit
bigger than your nail you're gonna take
a cup of water and water marble in it
just kidding up never water marbling in
my life why would you do that when you
can do this cheat for all your little
pieces of stolen water marble into the
cup and this will help separate the
colored part of the paper from the white
paper background after just about 20
seconds under water it should separate
really easily and peel right off when I
did this last time I realized that when
you peel the stuff off the paper the
decal itself is actually transparent and
that's what gave me the idea to put it
over hollow glitter just rest your
little decals down on a mat to dry or
just hang out whatever and how cool is
that oh my god it's so jelly and rainbow
okay we should focus focus let me show
you how to do this I'm gonna take your
piece of stolen water marble put it over
your nail and try and place it in a
position where you like the design look
the best to trim some of the excess of
the water marble sticker thing off the
sides and around your nail then I'm just
adding a clear polish to the top of my
holographic glitter base to make it a
little bit sticky so we can stick on the
water marble decal acting quickly take
your stolen water marble that you've cut
out to fit your nail approximately more
or less and immediately stick it on to
the clear polish while it's still wet
then take a cleanup brush dipped in
acetone or nail polish remover and use
it to seal in the edges all around your
nail this helps to dissolve the edges of
the plastic which makes it stick to your
nail better and give a more seamless
look so it doesn't look like you just
put a sticker on your nails no it looks
like you tend a real water marble over
glitter to finish off your mind-blowing
rainbow nails you're gonna add a nice
generous glossy top coat to seal
everything in don't forget to wrap the
top coat around the tips of the nail to
keep everything on longer as well and I
think these are some of the most
impressive nails I've ever made and I
stole them these remind me a lot of my
rainbow highlighter nails it's kind of a
similar concept and that you put
translucent rainbow colors over top of
hollow glitter and so now you've got the
most rainbow sparkliest water marble
nails ever and you didn't even have to
water marble just remember to give
credit to whoever's water marble you
stole and printed on your nails
thanks a gala I love these so much that
I wore these for 12 days and no they
didn't pop off partly because I wrapped
the tips of the nail polish really well
except yeah you can see that the tips
are really worn off by now
you follow me on snapchat you may
remember this
picture and this is probably a month
later than when I took that's not my
username is simply nil object cache yes
there's no L there wasn't enough room to
put an L to MU snapchat and now twelve
days later we're finally gonna peel it
off oh yeah that felt so good let's show
you again I'll show you my thumb oh yes
that's your big satisfying pea you'll
love how it just pops right off and
there you go there's my little pili
trophies and I'm gonna put in my fila
bag and then under my pillow hope you
guys enjoyed this rainbow holo glitter
version of cheating at water marble
nails and thanks so much for watching
I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
