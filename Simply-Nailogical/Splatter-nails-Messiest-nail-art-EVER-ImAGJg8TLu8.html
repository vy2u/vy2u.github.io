the bush these are the ugliest nails
ever it's a good thing it's almost
Halloween so I can just pretend I did
this on purpose for an ugly costume or
something start out innocent with plain
white nail polish on your accent nail
you can watch my other video on what's
the best white polish if you want a
video that's actually going to be
informative learn how to paint your nail
and not your finger Christine this is
embarrassing
ah yes the best thing about this video
so far is that I'm gonna use black
hollow cuz it's Halloween soon hahaha oh
oh oh that makes it sound like Christmas
and it's only October this black hollow
is color club two beyond and you can
find it at the link in the video
description box how helpful those links
are unless it's sold out then the link
wasn't helpful at all back to what I'm
going to try and fail at doing today I
love it when youtubers get back on track
don't you here's some straws I've got
that we're gonna cut in hat because I
don't know why I just felt like coming
in and half to out the environment or
something and I also got some coffee
stick straw things that I thought I was
being all innovative and smart using
these instead of straws because it might
give a different splatter pattern or
something yogurt container later
Oh item you don't care about a bunch of
colorful polish we're not colorful
polish whatever appears simply peel yes
you absolutely need her for this mess or
else you will have a terrible mistake
that you will be unable to clean up all
over your fingers I'm applying her like
normal around my cuticle first like I do
for gradients etc etc how do people say
things apparently I pronounced a lot of
things wrong Congress channel I'm just
going to blame it on me being Canadian
whatever oops I messed up my board let
me just rub that away like it really
matters you gotta really prepare
yourself for the mess that will come
from the splatter battlefield so in
order to do that you dis apply the
simply peel all the way down your finger
basically covering your entire hand and
then you look like you are actually
ready to go for howling because you look
like a mummy or someone who done to
their hand in crusty old milk look at my
fingers they are shrink-wrapped sausages
let's start with pink because pink is
pretty I'm gonna try the traditional
straw method first and just kind of
shove it on the paint to scoop it up I
don't know like just get it inside there
you just gotta get it inside the tip you
know basically I'm blowing on the other
end I don't think you need to see that
it is I hope I don't need to explain to
you how to blow something that didn't
work too well let's try to get holy
that worked way too well there is so
much pink can it land it right on my
nail while I'm still good at this okay
let's try the coffee straw cuz I'm
really at that time in my nail art
career where I would really like to find
a new nail art technique okay oh that
did not work the holes are too small or
something let's pretend that it was just
that part that was like defective cut it
again start fresh it's gonna work it's
gonna be amazing because it has a double
barrel okay it's like a double-barrel
shotgun I mean guns are bad don't talk
about them why is this not working
you're supposed to work and make me to
genius dammit oh look and blowing the
polish
my god you just see that do you see
those like speed bubbles coming out
that's disgusting okay I give up on this
method and I'm just gonna go back and
delete it from all my footage and
pretend that I never tried it cuz I
wouldn't want to embarrass myself now
would I get off of me fool you disgust
me it's not possible that you were born
from my brain you must have been adopted
I'm taking this off so easily right
before your eyes because I used a peel
off base coat underneath like I do with
all my manicures that I'm not sure if
I'm gonna want to take off two seconds
later well clearly I'm still gonna need
to whip out the acetone because I didn't
get it all did I uh I already hate what
this is doing to my cuticles I hate
using nail polish remover says the nail
polish addict quick must rehydrate the
disgusting parched cuticle and
surrounding skin is my favorite nail oil
by simply pure you can find it at the
link below where I write that here's a
link to my favorite nail oil is magic
this English language isn't it and this
is what the morning-after looks like
kids yet you better dispose of that
nasty latex stuff or else your parents
might find it okay I've decided I'm sick
of pink nail polish right now and I'm
gonna try the shimmery purple instead
look I can do a water marble done oh
yeah look at that swipe back and forth
opposite directions I'm never gonna be
good at this am I
all right on a scoop you up and spit you
air and that's a blob whoa isn't that
super cool when you can see the nail
polish like kind of contract and go back
out it's really just me blowing too hard
and there's no nail polish coming out I
feel like I might avoid the blobs if I
tap it it just a little bit before I
blow now let's see if I am right I am
wrong that actually doesn't look so bad
so I'm gonna keep it okay let's do the
middle finger now oh that was good
Kristine even though you got a big blob
on the black paper I was also good okay
let's not ruin it let's move on to white
oh yeah oh wow that is some cool good
blow technique Christina how do you even
do that oh you always know how to overdo
everything don't you why do I even do
this to myself oh I don't know oh my god
this is disgusting I hate splatter nails
why do I even do these I had to do
splatter because of the stupid Instagram
challenge that I co-host on Instagram
where we decided it would be a good idea
to have splatter is one of the themes
why am I so dumb I don't know oh you
poor thing you need so much nail oil to
rejuvenate all that chiness and
nastiness oh my god okay back to the
middle finger that one came on quite
nicely actually
just a little gloppy oh yeah you stupid
little neon painting that now looks red
i'ma blow you with some white these
blobs are not having it today you're
just not willing to separate from their
family boo back hollow on a straw look
at that twirl oh look at that that's
like marble guys except for this that is
on my finger yeah marble effect done
with your mouth that you can see that
I'm actually contented this one not this
part though and thank God for simply
peel for protecting me from everything
that's wrong in the world
check out this black Hollow everywhere
things ain't Halloweeny enough if
there's not a neon green that you would
never wear on a shirt in public it's
pretty much going everywhere except for
on my nail
hello and Go Go and yep this is the real
swamp family right here oh my god like
I'm trying to peel the off and it's
still under my cuticle simply peel could
not save me from the splatter mess and
that's because the splatter mess is the
devil you can't fight with the devil can
you alright so I guess I'm gonna have to
resort to using my clean up brushes
lucky for me I have these awesome ones
from twinkle teeth that hold up great
too acetone if you use my code simply to
get 10% off so you can also be clean see
I promote purity and innocence here on
simply a logical YouTube channel don't
blow paint on your clean up brush
alright
I'm gonna do you next oh I came way too
early and way too much and in the wrong
place alright not so bad not so bad now
we got to go slow and be strategic okay
because we don't want to ruin this
entire nail like we did the other one
and yeah let's just pretend I blew
something right there I think I've got
the hang of this now guys you kind of
like blow it and move it around side to
side okay I take that back I don't know
what up in there alright well I'm just
gonna give up now because I got anything
else to it and I'm pretty sure my nails
will weigh me down to the bottom of the
ocean I'm cheating a bit by scooping up
a little bit of the gunk you lost simply
feel like it's a big deal because now
I've got a mess literally everywhere
despite the simply peel hello I
forgot about you it's my pointer finger
okay
I really don't care at this point what
she's gonna look like so I'm just gonna
blow rent me everywhere and hope that it
looks ok I'm done I'm so done right now
and by this point I have a massive
migraine because even when you blow the
straw you still end up inhaling a little
bit that's why I think at this point I'm
kind of high possibly because I might
have actually inhaled them through straw
in my mouth some of you guys have even
commented asking me if I was drunk or
high while making these videos well I
think this video answers your question
so that means you can excuse me for my
behavior in anything I said that offends
you
well now look at what you guys have done
ok you made me ruin my nice plain black
background that I use for all of my
video tutorials and how it's covered in
paint everywhere and I can't reuse it
let's take a moment to reflect on all
the things I sacrifice for you including
my black poster board
I even sacrifice my camera for you
because I touched it with my green hands
there you go hashtag appreciation and we
didn't even get great nail art out of it
did we well I'm just in denial so I'm
just gonna topcoat it maybe that will
shrink the size of the massive globs on
my fingers or anything to save this man
yeah well see I was too lazy to fix the
pinky and make it match the other nails
so too bad let's just pretend I don't
have it oh I know how we can fix this oh
yeah that's right hollow is the answer
to all of your problems and questions
and prayers crap
it still looks ugly his manicure is so
bumpy and it looks the form it's
borderline bubble nails intent
my next video will be all right so this
was a total flop and I fully admit it
now I can't wait to get it off me oh my
god I can't stand you get off me you're
an embarrassment to this nail-art family
that's so much better back to the yellow
nails that I know and love all right I'm
thinking that we should redeem this
video by doing something actually cool
on our nails oh yeah we have a number
Union with multi chrome fun lacquers
this one came it's reunion by chance
yeah look at that
it's indigo and then it's pink what
mind-blown
all right so these are thin and nature
because I don't know the multi-prong
pigments I like just burst and that's
just the science or something but once
you apply the second ho BAM you see a
girl it's like full-on full-blown multi
chrome metallic shimmery goodness on
your nails and guess what we're gonna
top it with Hollow but not the hollow
you think this is actually not
technically a hollow topcoat this is
star Alize magic rainbow and you can
find it at the link below
it is in theory a hollow that is
supposed to be worn on its own not a
taco but I'm a rule breaker and I don't
care
oh yeah glossy top coat me up girl
finally you do not have disgusting shine
on her nails look at that look at that
okay wait you haven't seen the real
beauty yet wait for it kind of got this
neat depth to it doesn't it you see the
dark purple peeking on through and
remember
isn't even under the Sun under the Sun
would look for more epic but I'm a
vampire and I don't go outside so I
can't show you that all right okay
here's the money shot here's where you
can really see the multiplayer back - so
you going back to the pinkish purplish
color and then you see going back to the
Indigo which color hmm yeah I love this
 okay well I had ugly males an hour
before but now I feel better about my
self-esteem all right see you next time
and follow me on snapchat bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
