it's basically weaponized hallo finally
my prayers have been answered
well hallo everyone it's me christine
again and yes i'm wearing lipstick i
know that it's quite rare for me but
thanks to the teach me had a beauty tour
which you guys saw me start off last
week what are you doing your mom I've
learned that there's many things I can
do to my face to make it look better if
you haven't seen the first episode make
sure you watch I put a little cookie
button here somewhere please come with
on my journey to be beautiful person as
for today's video it's it's actually
nails
I am so goddamn excited that I was
finally able to get my hands on this I
learned about this shit a couple months
ago when I saw Suzy from nail Career
Education use it on her channel you
should check her out she's super
talented and she's a real nail art
channel now months ago I went online to
try and buy this stuff myself but the
shop would only let you buy things if
you were a professional licensed nail
tech and that's not me
so naturally I just asked a nail tech
friend to buy it for me I would shout
her out to thank her but I don't want to
get her license revoked for such
criminal activity you know this is a
serious crime okay now that you are
finally in my possession let's play
together now I found Suzy's video on
these really helpful and it seemed like
there honestly wasn't much to it you
just spray it on wet stuff and wow it's
magical let me read the instructions
anyways oh there they are
it's a pictorial now taco on now color
on now no taco on now spray now Paco
what now rub now beautiful nail for
professional use only professional
youtuber this doesn't really tell me
much about what actually is this
ingredients polyethylene terephthalate
isobutyl noxee oxy resin Lumina meeee
I don't know what that is that's an
element on the periodic table I'm not
100% sure but I don't think this is just
loose hollow glitter does that make
sense it sounds like there's some kind
of resin or somewhat of a clear liquid
in this to make it actually spray in the
street but I'm not a scientist I'm just
a hollow sexual
shake well before use if this shit is
anything like the fucking goddamn spray
nail-polish some guy then I should be
protecting the entire room Dexter style
on second thought though this is hollow
glitter so I don't think I'll really
mind the overspray haha just in case
though I'm wearing a shirt I don't give
a shit about well I don't give a shit
about most of my clothes but fellow
glitter assemble bit these aren't hollow
what the guy did not order these that's
better actually neither is this one this
one is some mermaid bullshit but it can
stay ah weird just came out like some
solid stream am i doing this wrong does
what's supposed to happen I thought I
was expecting like a stream of resin or
clear Coco see that one has a more
evenly dispersed spray effect I think
these are two different brands maybe
that's why so Susie said to put on a gel
taco first but not to cure it yet
because then when you spray the glitter
it has something to stick to
I painted my nails black first just so
you could see the contrast of the hollow
glitter on the black better so we can
see how this product actually behaves
alright let's try this purple lilac
holovid hologram lilac really chicken
shake shake shake
this is kind of fun wow that looks cool
actually think it looks nice a little
dispersed like that over the black but
for the sake of science let's make this
completely opaque and see if it does a
good job at that
and now we cure it
not that it's sick or anything hahaha
such a bad mom joke must be this goddamn
lipstick it makes me look and feel like
a mom so by curing this it's hardening
the gel so that the hollow glitter will
stay in it then you're supposed to dust
it right off your skin isn't even
quicker hack just use a lint roller oh
look at all the hollow good or I wasted
that's not good what about the children
in Africa
someone may actually comment that I kid
you not this doesn't feel like there's
any kind of sticky residue or resin
actually within this product it
literally just seems like loose hollow
glitter dusting very dusting into the
world this is the kind of thing I would
carry in my purse for protection from
the haters you know what I'm saying it's
the haters Hollow
I'm sorry I'm a terrible person
now let's try out holo pink yes oh god
this one does not have a very controlled
stream the size of this hollow glitter
is quite a lot smaller than the purple
hollow glitter honestly I think I prefer
the bigger size you know there's just
more sparkle to it alright alright let's
bake that shit for a minute and dusty
dusty yeah I'm not a fan of this one as
much as the other one I am gonna add a
glossy taco over all of them but for now
let's just try all the colors another
one another one let's try to some
classic silver holo this is a smaller
glitter size
oh wait a second we haven't talked about
what's on my other hand is it weird to
watch my say that with my face it's
actually not Paulo Wow last honey I know
but I'm kind of doing this slate grayish
blueish metallic foil looking polish
it's kind of shiny but grungy at the
same time I like it the pinky looks
alright but it could be better
I find the tinier Hollow pigment
actually looks a little dull like it's
not that shiny so it doesn't reflect the
rainbow so well which makes me sad let's
try this aqua blue hollow glitter color
ready aim follow oh shit that's gorgeous
oh damn girl wow that is beautiful
everything is alright let's do the
thumbs up give this video a thumbs up
the last color of hollow I have is black
hollow I saved my soul for last let's
see how you perform oh that's not that
black it's like silver the heck this
isn't really black hollow it's just
shiny black glitter with silver hollow
in it mother
he's trying to trick us this so looks
cool though but it's not the same as
real black hole alright we're looking
good in the hollow glitter neighborhood
I suppose you don't have to put on a
final coat of glossy taco you could
leave it a little textured but you know
me girl I'm all about that glassy taco
do me a favor and don't look that up on
your Ben dictionary that's not the
definition I mean someone please update
that I'm definitely feeling the bigger
sizes of hollow glitter honestly the
other two are just kind of dull and not
that hollow although the end result is
probably similar to just dipping your
finger and glitter the application is
because this shit you just spray on for
the sake of science I've tried the
burnishing technique to see if I could
smooth out the glitter on the nail but
it didn't really work so well over wet
gel polish because it was just sticking
to the sponge applicator and then it
kind of messed up the look of the
glitter anyways but if you use the
glitter burnishing technique along with
the sticky base coat I suggested in my
how to apply loose glitter video make
sure to check out that video to learn
more I put the link down below and after
you spray on the hollow glitter you can
buff it into the nail with a sponge
applicator to flatten it out for a
smoother and more uniform look I think
it looks slightly better than just
spraying it on but I bet it's one of
those things that only you would notice
now can you use this free glitter
without having to use gel yes all you
got to do is apply a nice thick coat of
whatever glass you taco or clear nail
polish you like because the glitter just
needs something sticky to adhere to you
will have to wait a bit longer for the
glitter and taco to dry and set whereas
with the gel it dries under the magic
light in a minute however for all the
non gel normal nail polish users out
there good luck getting this shit
because you can't buy it unless you
professional you got to get that shit on
the hollow black market okay I know a
guy just BMA okay also if you subscribe
to my channel it may sweeten the deal
but can you do designs with this well I
tried here's my attempt at a hollow
airbrushed gradient and yeah man what if
I do some abstract modern french tip
bullshit design uh hell I can't even see
what I'm doing interesting interesting
how did Susie do this shit so easily as
jenna would say susie girl susie girl
shall we attempt some elegant flow
design shit
okay I'm going for it blind or not
sprayed to reveal wow where did that
talent come from well shit okay here's
my final thoughts well I think this
stuff is a little redundant with the
loose hollow glitter you can buy from a
whole bunch of different nail art
companies you can get it in a little pot
or in a little baggie 5 grams please
that's my usual dosage despite the
ingredients suggesting there's some kind
of resin
in here it really just seems like it's
just loose glitter that's it over all
this stuff is pretty simple and easy to
use I still don't understand why they
wouldn't allow non licensed
professionals to buy this I mean what
did they think I would do something
stupid with this hey Ben Frank Channel
though you're supposed to pay for pranks
it's just a prank bro you look really
pretty dazzling give me a little twirl
well I guess they weren't wrong just
