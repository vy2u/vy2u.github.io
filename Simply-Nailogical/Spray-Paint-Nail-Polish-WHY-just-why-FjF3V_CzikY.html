hello hello everyone and welcome to
story time with Christine I'm just
kidding those are fucking boring today
we are doing something really really
exciting
testing out spray nail polish I know I'm
like so late to this game because
youtubers did this like eight months ago
but but I have a valid excuse and that's
because I live in Canada and they don't
sell these here yet I actually drove all
the way from Canada to the United States
just for this did you know it's illegal
to ship these products to Canada so I
decided to put my criminology degree to
good use
and I smuggled them across the border
ajan if I were on the show border
security and the guards decided to stop
me I'd be like ma'am are you bringing
back any nail polish into the country no
oh I have no idea what you're talking
about these are really cold even though
the spray shit has been reviewed to
death already I'm gonna do one too
anyways because you guys all asked for
it like so many of you not really sure
why because as far as I know these do
not come in hollow now I've seen these
reviewed before and I have learned how
messy they can be because it's spray
polish which means you go like this and
the shit goes everywhere so therefore
I'm going to take the necessary steps to
protect myself
you're right back gotta get protection
alright then we're ready for murder
I should probably read the instructions
perfect polish application is only a
spray away that's why they call me
simply spray logical the paint can
couldn't be easier to apply a perfect
application of color in a few easy steps
plus the hour I just spent prepping my
room for Dexter apply a base coat I
should probably take my gloves off oh
yeah I can't really wear gloves when I
do this can I and I use a peel off base
coat though it doesn't say yes that
means I can't not use one all right
let's see if I can give you a dual
action view well the fun going on today
so you can study later and do this at
home oh don't get it on the plastic all
right that let that draft we recommend
two in one top and base coat why would
you ever recommend that that's like
saying you recommend using two-in-one
shampoo and conditioner and everyone
knows that's bullshit step 2
shake the paint can and from a distance
of 10 to 15 centimeters anyone ever
ruler we strive for scientific
excellence on this channel don't worry
if you get it on your skin around your
nails don't worry they say don't worry
anybody are you ready oh thank god
hopefully fuck and we are safe to
continue and even here we can't even
hear myself that's why I'm yelling I
can't wear this anymore I could never
work in asbestos removal secondly
earrings that's enough
that allowed to dry for a few minutes
done step 3 apply a topcoat
we recommend two-in-one top and base
coat you just said that not coat top
coat here and buy 2 get your tacos
really changes the way it looks though
to add a topcoat guess I should do my
other hand I'm too lazy to remove this
nail polish so I'm just gonna spray on
top of it
Eddie friggin Diegans that mist
okay I forget how bad that was yes the
upside of this is that for people who
can't paint with the opposite hand it's
pretty easy to spray with your opposite
hand like literally can't see out of
these glasses pretty sure that they have
paint on them it's top coat you up
trouble is I just can't touch anything
without getting paint all over it
anyone notice how my middle finger is
really crooked on my other hand it's a
birth defect okay don't make fun of me
Anna seems silly to have a spray polish
but not a spray top coat and base coat I
know I'm just being a smartass it's what
I do best
I leave my fingers like this it actually
looks pretty cool it's like an
avant-garde vogue photo shoot yes yes
give me more oh that's the next step
step four wash away any excess polish
from the skin and cuticles and voila
perfectly applied polish in a heartbeat
I don't know how slow your heartbeat is
but mine is a lot faster than the time
it's taken you to just get to this that
I was right there is pink shit all over
my glasses that's why I can't see you
see this right there and there and
everywhere
check me out hate washing my hands
oh it's so weird fucking my cuticles
skip go get out back to the lab it's
actually not that bad if you're a virgin
oh I'm really liking this color
combination that I created don't forget
to credit me if you use my genius idea
all that shit is in my cuticles for the
next two weeks so I guess we've
concluded that these can paint your
nails much and you do nail art with them
as there would be no point in nail
polish if it can't be used for nail art
it's now but idle time we're gonna use
some Cyclone nail vinyls because you
move your body like a cyclone could do
it all night long anyone else remember
that song okay protection engage again
I'm gonna spray my nails the opposite
color but since I don't really care to
soak my hands in water why don't we just
peel off the overspray like this was the
obvious answer for this product all
along what does that sound like dry
simply feel dry ingredients
I'm methyl or acetate is why psycho
dough all about Europe cautions
pressurized container may burst if he
don't put this in the microwave if
medical advice is needed a product
container or label at hand I is there
medical advice somewhere on here I don't
see it keep out of reach of children and
cats you forgot to add cats
be careful min Chi you might turn into
the Pink Panther us a warning why is
there a different warning for the US
shouldn't everyone be warned equally
avoid spraying in eyes apparently
Americans need to be told don't spray
this in your eyes but Europeans don't
warning this product contains a chemical
known to the state of California to
cause cancer that's good that's great
we're all gonna die anyway so might as
well increase the chance of dying life
spray painting our nail see under the
bottle but
doesn't say anything under there except
for a date Oh to 2019 is that like the
date of my death clock or something all
right simply peel is dry it's time to
get high I sound like a dying chipmunk
oh shit I forgot I'm wearing a peel off
a skull oh there you go see this is the
right stuff just peel all the spray away
that was my skin I'll peel off simply
peel like no big deal you're off with me
ah they said I couldn't save you but I
said I could relieve no naked nail
behind beautiful you know the real
reason why I just put simply peel on
because I really really really like
peeling things you and there's so little
overspray on me so these actually look
way better than I thought that they
would turn out but I do know what we can
add to make them even better
am I supposed to get to my nail polish
about the hollow see if we just put on a
hollow topcoat no one will notice the
big chunks of my nail that are missing
are fact so just add a quick dry top
coat is we're gonna add nail I knows
next oh we already did that step 2 hey
mom you know what they say about people
that can't come I don't know what they
can to dip this together dad does break
paint in the tub
my hands are so dry from washing them so
many times I feel so much better
okay so here's my highly anticipated
meaningful review it did actually apply
pretty decently and it washed off as it
said it would which I was honestly
surprised by that I thought that I would
be picking my skin for days good job
guys good job but it still made a
disaster zone out of my cuticles
could have completely been avoided by
just painting my nails the old-fashioned
way with my hands in fact I find it
pretty ironic how the premise of this
product is that you only have to spray
it on so you don't have to paint your
nails with your hands but you do have to
paint your nails with your hands twice
top and base coat other reasons why I
think this product is dumb I could have
just simply peeled instead of washing my
hands and making them all dry and crusty
they don't come in hollow and I forgot
to add the price these spray cans cost
$12 us from Sephora or 10 pounds from
nails ENCOM and if you listen to them
and use it with the paint cans best
friend who and one base and top coat and
that's $20 for $20 you could have gotten
two color Club hollows or you could have
just gone to the salon and had them
paint your nails one boring color and
you wouldn't have spray mist everywhere
it literally made a massive mess of pink
shit everywhere and thankfully I decided
to protect this room because if I didn't
think ahead I would be pretty pissed
that all my shit was turned paint all
that and I almost died from inhaling the
cancer apparently I was just blowing my
nose and there's literally pink my
boogers are pink I'm not a doctor but I
don't think this is good okay okay okay
I get it
marketing moguls thought that well women
can spray their hair with shit why can't
they spray their nails with shit genius
men you're so smart you get us so well
you got to be honest okay this product
is pretty gimmicky I wouldn't be
surprised if it was sold on infomercials
oh just to be clear I think the spray
paint nail polish thing is pretty silly
but I still like nails ink and
everything else they do I'm told they
were the first nail company to come up
with this idea and it's definitely
innovative and we got a respect forward
thinking personally though I think that
the next time I go to pick up some nails
ink products I'll be shopping in their
actual nail polish bottle section you
know those ones with the brushes that go
directly on your nail focus on the
positive things Christine focus on the
positive okay maybe this product is good
for people who can't reach their feet to
paint their toenails that
just ignore the nail polish that I've
had on for four years what's called look
good pink frostbite yeah so I guess it's
kind of smart to spray on your feet
fuck how am I gonna wash it off though
how am I supposed to walk to the sink
without making a pink mess everywhere I
didn't think this through did I have a
penguin and I got pink feet I don't Lee
one pink yeah I need crashes someone
taking it to the ER I have a pink foot I
called this pink Toa situs the very
serious medical condition oh no you
can't see my hairy legs go away when you
have no hands use your feet oh shit I I
forgot to put the top coat on so it's
not even staying on my toenails all that
effort is wasted down the drain oh I'm
never gonna use these again but I might
as well make use of spray paint the way
that most people make use of spray paint
I just read the lines apologize please
subscribe to my channel thanks bye
we're not actual criminals guys or two
knights whose why we're such good
citizens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
