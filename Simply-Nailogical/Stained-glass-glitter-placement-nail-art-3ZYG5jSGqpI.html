yeah stained glass nails I'm not gonna
lie these are sick
oops I mean no swearing on the internet
allowed I was inspired by glitter
fingers she has lots of fingers at least
three of them on Instagram when she made
this beautiful Rose stained glass look
but we all know since pretty florals
aren't really my thing
I made this abstract kind of floral
looking but not really hollow glitter
stained glass extravaganza start off
with a plain black please yeah black
can't speak today start off with a plain
black base coat one of these days I will
do what's the best black polish but
until then my current favorite is Colt
nails Nevermore but sadly Colt nails has
shut down forever and all their polishes
are discontinued which means I will have
to do a what's the best black so I can
find myself a new black eventually once
your black is dry whip out your crappy
acrylic paint I get online from the
local craft store and even though you
guys are telling me I should probably
get proper acrylic paint I'm still too
lazy to have done so so I put a bunch of
colors on a yogurt container lid whipped
out my new brush kit from twinkle teeth
and randomly started drawing on a
pattern as a guideline for the glitter
that was gonna put on after now this is
the part where like it truly does not
matter if you don't have to paint in all
seriousness look at the literal mess I'm
painting on my nails a bunch of colorful
blobs of chalk drawn by a three-year-old
in kindergarten alright so once you've
drawn your masterpiece with your
different colors of acrylic paint you're
all done look at that beautiful
yeah I'm just kidding we're not in
anywhere near done we've got five hours
to go let's take a break before we get
going and stare at all this hollow
glitter I got from twinkle tea
oh my god they're so pretty they shine
all the rainbows in the light and
there's even a holographic double te on
the front of the bottles oh yeah or the
gold into the mass of glitter rainbows
I use a fan brush for you guys and
spread it out a little and make it
nicely framed for a great visual shot
mmm playing with the focus feature on my
lens is fun I'm getting high already
from staring at all this hello good my
god I'm gonna die I will not be held
responsible for you passing out on your
desk as a result of staring at too much
hollow glitter good news for you guys I
found a couple the hollow glitters I
used on twinkle teen site for sale
that's right get a few bucks off and you
can get even more off 10% to be exact
when you use my code simply action cast
so this is what it looks like when you
think I'm picking up the glitters and
this is what it actually looks like
because I had to move the glitter out of
the way so I could film my nail so you
better say Thank You Christine for
giving me a very satisfying
on screen hollow glitter experience
meanwhile I had to suffer by straining
my eyes to pick out every single color
from this stupid piece of white paper
that I threw all the glitters on alright
let's do this bitches take it clear
polish not a taco moron why in this
video on how to do a glitter placement
for beginners paint it on one small
section on your nail and then grab a
toothpick lick the tip of it and use it
to pick up every hollow glitter one by
one placing them on the nail and then
they'll stick right down to the clear
polish that you just put on make sure to
work quickly on this because the clear
polish can dry in approximately a minute
that was my serious instructional tone
how'd I do did you learn something
even if you didn't then you still get to
watch me play some real and glitters on
my nails that you're never gonna do in
your real life anyways cuz ain't nobody
got time for that unless you're me and
you have no life and your best friends
are cast
so now that that I don't know what to
call it circular component part of this
design is out of the way let's try these
somewhat petal resembling pieces so as
you can see I'm working small section by
small section and by doing this the
clear nail polish doesn't dry up too
fast and I have enough time to keep
placing letters of different colors the
only problem with doing this is that
sometimes you go colorblind because of
all the holo and you put on the wrong
color like I just put red when I should
have put gold and I blame this mess for
that there we go
gold goes where it's supposed to moving
on up or down whatever angle you're
watching this vision at this point I was
already regretting my decision to do
these nails but I had faith that the end
result would be worth it and that the
YouTube video would get a bunch of views
I mean in all seriousness how many
youtubers do you hear saying oh my god I
love my fans so much like I wish you
guys could come live with me and be my
bestie really all they mean is that they
want your views don't you understand
youtubers make money for people watching
their videos okay so the next time
youtuber tells you that they love you so
much what they really mean is I love it
when you click play on my videos cuz I
get some money at least you know all the
money I make from my channels going to a
good place
that being mentees college fund okay I
should probably stop telling you all the
secrets that youtubers had from you but
this blue tur placement took a long time
so I had to say something to fill up the
time otherwise it's just so awkward
watching someone do their nails without
saying anything
okay we're almost done I promise just
got to do the end I'm gonna do them with
black Hollow
yeah black hollows so fucking awesome I
don't see black hollow glitters around
often what's interesting is that the
angle that the light is hitting it when
I'm putting it on the nail that you see
on-screen isn't really showing the
hollow but the second it starts to shift
and the light black hollow shows like
mad rainbows for real people mad
rainbows that have gone insane
let's finish off the rest the mail with
another rounded looking thing as you can
tell I'm not really being that careful
in my placement of glitters that are
kind of sticking over top of each other
and overlapping but doesn't really
matter you'll see once we put the
acrylic paint on that the messiness
doesn't have that much of an impact on
the final effect all right that's it
you've just completed five hours of your
life can you see the effect can you see
what the picture is supposed to be nope
neither can i this looks like a
clusterfuck of rainbows to me add a
glossy quick dry top coat because you're
going to add acrylic paint on top of the
topcoat the reason why we put the top
coat on now is to create a nice smooth
surface to paint on let that fully dry
it should only take about 15 to 20
minutes as long as you are using a quick
dry top coat which you better because I
tell you to in all my videos take a thin
ish paint brush I use one of mine from
my twinkle tea brush pack to put in some
black acrylic paint and start outlining
your shapes in between the different
colors of the hollow glitters now you
could use black nail polish here but I
tend to prefer to use acrylic paint
because it's easier to work with
it applies smoother and you can scratch
it off with the toothpick if you
accidentally put on too much so as you
may know I can't actually freehand paint
that well and so it's a good thing that
the glitters were organized in a way
that makes absolutely no sense
and there's no discernable pattern and
this is what I mean by being able to
scratch off acrylic paint if you put too
much on right after you paint it on you
can easily just take a toothpick and
scratch a little bits off but you be
careful because the glitters are kind of
like 3d or texture rather that they kind
of stick out your nail so you can't
press too hard or else you'll end up
potentially popping a glitter off
depending on how crafty your black
acrylic paint is I recommend doing a
second photo over all your black lines
to make sure that the black is very
opaque a little scratchy scratch here
and another scratchy scratch there and
you are done my friend you are done with
all the hard work and now you get to
enjoy one of the most satisfying parts
of doing a glitter placement just go
ahead and slide that glossy top coat
right on girl brings out the hollow
glitter shine even brighter than Kim
Kardashian's ass and one of her latest
photo shoots now it's so beautiful and
rainbow the most puzzling part about
these kinds of nails is that there's
inevitably going to be people who click
the dislike button while the dislike
errs please leave their address below in
the comment section so I can come to
your house and kill you I'm just kidding
I'm not actually going to kill you but I
will take a large envelope of hollow
glitter and throw it in your face and
then on your grave and then I'm going to
dance on Your Grave with my nails and
with a bunch of halogen lights flashing
but the party always comes to an end and
eventually you know you've got a cleanup
there comes a sad time and all nail art
attics life when you gotta take off that
beautiful man you just did because you
want to do another beautiful mani
because you're addicted to doing your
new I wore these nails for three full
days and then pop them off just as easy
as Miley Cyrus likes to pop some Molly
before hosting the VMAs I know you guys
share my special satisfaction seeing
these glitter nails come off so here's a
couple more for you
this one had a bouncing back effect it
doesn't want to leave my nail oh yeah
what a clean clean pop that one was as
you can see there's oil on the inside
which is actually because I all dug my
nails real good before popping them off
it helps undo the stickiness of the
peel-off base coat that I use to take
off my nails though they're not fake
nails guys you saw me put them on there
real clearly you watch this other video
I made on how to use this peel-off base
coat and a couple other things you need
to know about it put a link down below
to my favorite peel-off base coat if
you're interested in checking it up for
yourself
and here's Mormon Chi so I can shut up
the people who complain that minty is no
longer at the end of my videos here are
you happy now got some kitten cuteness
good time for some nail porn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
