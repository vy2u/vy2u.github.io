and antenna is that right is that the
Star Wars intro theme I don't even know
I'm gonna admit something about myself
in this video right here right now that
I'm not sure you're gonna take too well
so I've never watched any of the Star
Wars videos and I truly have no
clue what they're about obviously I was
trapped in a closet painting my nails as
a child yeah that must be it but a lot
of people seem to care about this movie
coming out Friday or Saturday or I don't
know what day so let's do Star Wars
nails anyways cuz googling goes a long
way and it can tell me what the movie
was about so I can paint the movie on my
nails I start off with a black base coat
and you can find out what's my favorite
new black from a drugstore in my other
video hey I also have a what's the best
white polish video you can find that out
too I had a quick Drive topcoat to my
black and white nails because I'm not
sure what I'm gonna do yet so while I
wait and think about it might as well
let a quick dry top coat dry say that 10
times fast let a quick dry top coat dry
let a quick dry top coat dry left coat
rack that never mind let's put a galaxy
of sorts on one of my black nails
because Star Wars probably has stars in
it and there's probably a galaxy
those stars are hanging out in yeah
grade eight science you have taught me
so much I asked my boyfriend what was
iconic about Star Wars and he told me to
look up Star Wars yellow text and this
is what I found my what a joy to the
eyes this design is I can't wait to put
it on my nails but instead of writing
words cuz hat can't paint that small I'm
gonna be a smartass and use yellow stars
as the yellow text what happens in this
movie anyways the title seems to suggest
that stars got into a fight I mean what
did one star get mad because her bestie
stars Instagram pic was liked by the
first stars crush oh yeah that calls for
a war maybe the first star followed the
second star and then the second star
felt the first star back but then the
first start unfold the second star and
then the second star unfold the first
star back again and oh everyone
pissed and then there was a hairy monkey
that got thrown into the mix somehow how
do I know this because I eat at Subway
and the last few times I had lunch at
Subway they gave me a cup that had a
picture of the hairy monkey on it that
said Star Wars so that is how I know
this information Thank You subway um so
yeah this turned out like and it
doesn't look at all like this cascading
tech Star Wars effect thing nope not at
all how do I save this disaster maybe if
I put some gold flakies on it everything
will be better
nope get off of my nail this never
happened I've just disgraced a movie
series that I've never seen may the peel
be with you I'm just gonna start over
yeah let's do that and how about I just
go with a regular looking flaky galaxy I
don't have yellow flakies that I got
gold ish flakies look at all these
options I thought this color would be so
rare but in fact I have three of them
this one has gold hollow glitters in it
in addition to the golden flaky so
obviously I went with that add some
stars and I'll place them a reasonable
distance from each other so they don't
get into a fight good enough for me now
let's do some nails that actually seemed
to be inspired by the movie star wars
we're gonna make the laser beam swords
or the light spheres like safe sabers
light sabers yeah that's it
hockey team the Sabres there's a
basketball team I don't know I don't
know anything about sports either so I'm
gonna try the one stroke technique yeah
you may have seen this being done by
talented French artist Seth at the F pom
WA and depending on how crappy your
acrylic paint is you will do between 1
and approximately 20 different strokes
so it's not one stroke it's more like 20
stroke clean off your brush if it's
getting crusty and whoa look at that
space travel I'm blending the red into
some black acrylic paint now so I can
make the edges of the lightsaber glowing
thing look like they're actually fading
off into the universe I fought with
these gradients for a while before I
finally settled and then decided that I
would just paint a white stripe down the
middle to make things a bit easier do
you know how hard it is to paint on
really curved nails yeah it's really
hard from what I've seen in commercials
I'm pretty sure that lightsabers are
supposed to glow so what better to make
this lightsaber glow then use some
unicorn skin yes look at that green
magical glowing power it'll fend off all
the aliens and those angry stars so I
just cut a tiny piece to fit right down
the middle of my lightsaber thingy
majiggy and oh my god look I got hollow
on my other hand how did we not notice
this yet I'm applying just a clear
polish you could also use a top coat
just something so you can stick down
your glowing unicorn skin and on to the
next okay full disclosure this is the
hardest nail of all because I'm actually
gonna try it for him okay something
which I never do because I can't do it
so another thing that my boyfriend
answered when I asked him what was
iconic about Star Wars was the
stormtrooper so I googled it and then I
thought I'm pretty sure that you mean
Hailee Steinfeld the Trinity character
and Taylor Swift's bad blood video but
fine whatever I'll draw this weird guy's
head on my nail is it a guy or maybe
it's a girl or maybe it's an alien force
that doesn't actually have a gender I'm
not sure guys let me know it's clearly
someone who troops storm so that I know
because that makes so much sense at this
point at Canada just looks like the
sunglasses emoji except with the
mustache
we should probably fix that let's add
some grade down at the bottom because
it's like the shadow of his chin you
know stormtroopers need contouring too
he had some ventilation contraptions on
the side of his mask because you know
that's how he breathes and this little
circular plug type outlet that's where
he plugs into the matrix and his glasses
are kind of boring so I just decided to
put some reflection on them and then I
was still bored so I decided to make
that reflection colorful look he's got
red and blue that means he can see in 3d
okay I think we're done here so I'm just
gonna add a glossy top coat to all my
nails and seal in all this very accurate
Star Wars storytelling fabulousness and
now I am your father just call me daddy
star well I hope this nail tutorial got
you excited for the big premiere and if
it didn't then maybe you're more excited
for my own music video premiere I just
posted it the other day it's called
hollow it's me go watch that instead
that's one thing these nails are missing
it's hollow well there's like a little
bit in the flaky galaxy but other than
that yeah not much not much there is
however unicorn skin in these nails
though which makes me feel a little more
comfortable I mean look at all this
magic skin look at it up peeled it off a
unicorn don't worry no unicorns were
harmed but I did have to kill a bunch of
stormtroopers to get the unicorn skins I
mean does that even make sense in the
context of the Star Wars movie I don't
even know are those the bad guys I'm
sorry that I just don't know what Star
Wars is and you know I grew up thinking
that Star Wars and Star Trek were the
same thing okay Christine stop
embarrassing yourself okay I'm gonna go
now bye thanks for watching hope you go
see this movie it's gonna be great see
you later bye
