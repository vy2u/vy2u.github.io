well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again we're well into the holiday season
right now a time in which many put up
Christmas lights to celebrate you know
it goes great with Christmas lights an
alternate reality about fucked up scary
monsters that will pull you into a
creepy dimension called the upside-down
where it's basically snowing all the
time as a Canadian I can tell you that
that would suck I was inspired by the
Christmas tree communication with the
upside down seen from the Netflix series
stranger things
no this isn't sponsored but I wish it
was because it I love that show to put
actual flashing lights on my nails I
bought these NFC nail stickers look at
that technology I wanted to read the
instructions but I can't read the
instructions I'm pretty sure it says 11
it's an LED light with some circuits and
it comes on a sticky thing and oh what's
on my other hand it's a beautiful dark
purple linear holo polish ooh so evil
looking I love these kinds of shades for
the winter or any time of year let's be
honest hey don't get distracted you
mouth breather
basically these NFC things look like
what the government is gonna implant
into our brains in 20 years
unfortunately they don't work with
iPhones because iPhones don't have near
field communication technology so I had
to borrow my Android work phone because
it has this NFC allowed data exchange
when device touches another device that
device being my nails soon let's test it
oh it's not working I think this one is
broken yep that one was broken cuz this
one works fine OOP ain't
woo-loo-loo yellow all right Christine
stop playing we got to put this shit on
our nails first I'm adding a peel-off
base coat cuz I always do that that's
why now I'm adding some boring beige
color to mimic the wallpaper in the
scene of strange things now I'm going to
take this tiny piece of technology cut
the clear crap round it off and make
sure it still works after you do that
just do not cut the circuits
it's sticky on the back so you just
stick it on your nail
this is where I had a struggle my nails
are really curved and when you try and
put something flat on something curved
doesn't really work physics right to try
and fix that I'm applying some gel
polish under one side of the NFC sticker
then I'm going to press it down as I put
it under the LED gel curing lamp so
that's what I'm doing you just can't see
it it's like I'm in the upside down so
that kind of worked except it didn't
because now the other side isn't
sticking down all right okay this is a
seesaw so we're just gonna add some more
gel polish on that side cure it and well
does not want to cooperate does it I'm
just gonna add a bit more of clear gel
polish to try and smooth things out I
have no idea how anyone uses these on
their nails because if you think my
nails are long and you see how big this
NFC sticker is I don't know how anyone
with smaller nails could use these and
then not look actually ridiculous come
on engineers it's 2016 why can't we have
a little light that's like the size of
the light on this now with all that
other garbage around it can you tell I'm
not a nail tech I'm just gonna cover
that shit up with more beige and hope it
looks fine oh yeah that looks so smooth
flawless natural nails right there good
job Christine but hey I mean it's kind
of fitting it looks like the monsters
are trying to push themselves through
the wall from the upside down so let's
just pretend I did that on purpose now
we go on take some ugly-ass pinky Movil
dusty colors mix some acetone into them
and throw that shit on the wall like the
nasty wallpaper my nails are still wet
but who cares it gives it some
authenticity it's like mold is a wall oh
what a beautiful color of green now I'm
painting some florals you might not
think they look like florals but they're
florals now I'm taking some black
acrylic paint to do the best part which
is painting on the letters what's good
about this is in the actual scene it
looked like a distressed woman painted
the letters so I don't got to worry
about my shitty freehand skills praise
the upside down beautiful perfect
they're just random letters don't worry
I don't know what they mean but maybe
we'll find out now we got to add the
Christmas tree light strings very
challenging doing this on such a
mountainous surface didn't put the
sticker on my thumb but here it is the
just some hollow glitter all right these
look great and the monsters just really
want you to know that they're right
behind the wall I've been warned but
does it work what happens when you put
your nails by the phone why are you
keeping this curiosity door locked
Christine oh shit it works and now I'm
flashing you pretty cool gotta love
technology you got to be really close to
the phone for this to work so it looks
best when my nails are flat on the phone
and now it's time to enter the sensory
deprivation tank by turning off all the
lights oh look someone is trying to
communicate with us through the lights
I'm not sure what they're trying to say
because the flashing lights are so faint
but they're there
okay hollow talk to me talk to me where
are you
H good good good come on come on Oh
L
No
No
oh I don't know what that means
oh yes I do 8o l oh it's hollow party
with the monsters oh yes and upside down
turn smile to frown cuz feeling almost
i'ma make you man what even though the
NFC stickers are large as hell and look
like my nails are jacked up on something
this is pretty cool now I'm not just
simply no logical I'm simply
technological fear is excited for the
premiere of stranger things season 2
sometime next year let me know in the
comments what you think is going to
happen to 11 then when it finally airs
we can come back to this video and see
who was right
I think she's gonna live because she's
badass that's why who else can eat the
egg O's but her no one it just wouldn't
feel right hey before you go what do you
say we have a little peel porn fun oh
the combination of a peel off base coat
and gel polish is just so satisfying
when you go to peel it off it's like
ripping the monster right out of the
wall take that mother open the door and
you close the door you open the upside
down and you close the upside down and
you open the upside down and you close
the upside down okay I'm done oh shit
they're still communicating with us I
think they're trying to say don't forget
to subscribe to my channel but even if
you don't I'm gonna make you subscribe
with my mind
anyways anything alright guys thanks so
much for watching and I'll see y'all let
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
