every everyone speak Rossini
today we're having a garden party
because when you don't like going
outside bring the outdoors to you inside
isn't that right Mickey yeah cuz you an
indoor kitty and you like it that way
food spring is in the air the sun is
shining the birds are chirping and
people are gluing tiny plants to their
nails right so a while back you may have
noticed these kinds of pictures bouncing
around Instagram they call them
succulent nails no you succulent it's
absurd and practical and doesn't make
any sense I have to try it make sure you
stop that oh man she's so glad she's
warming up to the new space okay anyways
so it was videos like this one that went
viral on Facebook
sometime in the last year tip nails with
sub get it let's watch oh wow
those are beautiful they were created by
an expert botanical artist so not a nail
artist I was bored one afternoon and
decided to do something crazy that's me
every weekend also she glues them on
fake nails I see I see the process
doesn't harm the plants glue doesn't
harm the plants and like ripping them
apart I'm no garden hoe but I'm not sure
I believe that
oh wow that's pretty very tumblr chic
Arizona is all about inspiring people to
connect with nature this is about as
connected as L get it's just for fun
photos it's not really for everyday use
no
okay I'm ready to suck
for the first time in my life I went to
the garden center there were so many
plants and flowers and things that grow
are these flowers or plants Oh either
it's lettuce lettuce a foot but it was a
bit of a challenge finding flowers of
plants small enough for my nails I also
struggled to find actual succulents in
fact I wasn't even sure what the
succulent is feeling someone was nice
enough to help us know are there any
small ones hiding in here somewhere
maybe how do people like keep them small
they oh you don't keep them small but I
guess they get them really young and
they're still small okay well and it'll
make babies all the time it's always
gonna be small tiny fancy babies thank
you that's how babies are made and then
I couldn't help but have some fun of my
own in the garden catnip I didn't know
you couldn't grow your own catnip is
that it because I only go as I regulated
blue-eyed beauty beautiful gradients Wow
he loves me he loves me not and Ivana
does as flower is dying
just like all of us I wore green to
blend in can't you see me now what about
now I'll race you this flower is so
pigmented everybody grow low I think
these ones are free and you time you
subscribed aside from the succulents I
did spy a lot of really cute tiny
flowers and these ones look like
succulents but they're bright purple Wow
they all come in a pot of dirt so
they're pretty much all the same to me I
could just glue some succulents to a
fake nail like the girls in the video
but because I've known for my long sexy
natural nails I figured let's see if I
can put it right on my nails but first
it's time to peel born that's why we
gotta get naked before we plant a garden
first we got an oil up with my DIY nail
oil pen that I made myself
that's what DIY means you know this
unfortunately my naked nails are being
censored to abide with YouTube's
advertisers are friendly policies that's
right kids
nail porn is bad it was nail pawn hose
item to the PDA I can make a whole
garden how do these imagine if you could
plant a nail pili and the nails would
grow now Before we jump right in I gotta
do some tests because since I don't
really work with acrylics I'm wondering
if I could pluck off the greenery stick
it into a gel topcoat to cure it with
one of these gel topcoat alien baking
machines like this one it turns purple I
also don't look directly into it it's
bad for you and then in theory that
would instantly solidify the plant to
the nail let's see if that works
I've always start off with some flowers
because they're for beginners actually I
changed my mind we're gonna go to expert
level right away that kind of want to
dig right in so to speak now we're just
gonna file down the back stem so it has
a flat surface to fix to the nail Oh
the leaves are falling out the seasons
are changing you it's bleeding oh my god
I murdered it Oh committed horrible
crime and I deserve to suck in prison
for life alright anyways first let's
apply some nail polish and that's dab
dab dab
to make it even more fab a nice thick
coat of glass in jail taco so gel polish
never dries until it's cured under a UV
or LED lamps not so much drying as it is
curing like okay we dry now like it's
almost instant that makes it so because
the gel polish stays wet until we do the
curing step means we got plenty of time
to build our little
bharden alright now that the flowers are
mostly in the place I want them to be
we're gonna bake that for a minute
holy
we got a second egg on a stick man
look I did it it's like actually stuck
on there that's pretty fun I'm good okay
I'm a genius thank you I got I'm putting
on a heel off base coat yeah a little in
the way
okay don't need anything when you become
your cat's bench so because I'm gonna
want to keep whatever garden masterpiece
I create forever we're gonna use a
peeler base coat I'm just gonna paint on
some Brown creme polish first now let's
add some earth like flakey now I know
succulent nails kind of went viral like
last year but I didn't feel like doing
succulent Nilsen now I do I don't think
I even really know anyone who does a lot
of gardening or maybe I just don't know
anyone more generally speaking okay
we've done the base now we've got to
find a small little bitty succulent oh
what's that on my other hand
it's a gorgeous reflective teal metallic
foil polish ooh fancy
and it's even got some little pieces of
scattered hollow in it damn she looking
fine today
back to the succulent I want to try and
dig this guy out oh hello there yes Dan
just saw me in the garden if you need me
later I'm just gonna prune this little
sucker would you like a sack thank you
daddy
what is this
it's a green tea for your green man you
always do this to me you always Punk me
alright where were we
let's prep our little sucky by trimming
off the stems what is that oh my god
that's so weird I want to pick it out of
it is that the brain my brain - idiot
Wow oh my god this video is so
dirty
I wonder how quickly these die like
actually being plucked from the ground
do I have a time limit here my nails are
dry enough now to proceed and we're just
gonna add a nice thick coat of glossy
joe sacco yeah
this is actually really tricky
especially because I don't have both
hands on my coin I did it on the fake
nail make that all minute didn't
answer but they didn't answer me before
so it kind of worked it were to work
there stop oh my god
all right here we go a real stuff didn't
yes
this is AK I like glitter place an
announcement flower placement only the
earliest subscribers to my channel well
know what a glitter placement is quick
quick big big it and it's pretty sturdy
like I'm sure it would rip off if I
tried to do that but I would never
alright we good we gucci we gardening
i'm in bloom like troy serve an i mean
no no not in that way bake that for
a minute oh wow have you ever seen
someone so down to earth
but it's stunning actually so beautiful
Wow this would have been perfect for the
royal wedding it's a shame I wasn't
invited my grandma would be so proud of
me actually I'm gonna email her a photo
cuz she doesn't do you know text
messages what do you think she doesn't
get the meme actually she doesn't know
what a meme is said if she replies
sometime I'll share it with you right
here oh grandma
this was surprisingly easy to do all it
required was a bunch of tiny plants and
flowers and a Del Taco and a baking
machine you know just in case you wanted
to do it at home oh no my flowers on the
loose normally it's my mousse that's
hella lose in terms of wearability and
functionality did your obviously simply
not log too cool but I don't care I've
never looked so fancy in my life I
wonder if I shower with these if I mess
up looks like I'm like choking but I'm
not she's just really happily resting

much to show you other succulents with
flowers or begging justice stuff yeah
