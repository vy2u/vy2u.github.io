Christine again and today I've committed
nail-art suicide because there's not
much hollow on my nails as you can see
these nails are about the Suicide Squad
video so it only makes sense that my
nails had to suffer full disclosure I
had no idea what the Suicide Squad was
before you guys started bombarding me
with requests to do Suicide Squad nails
and so this will be an interesting video
before doing these nails I did actually
go see Suicide Squad in theaters figured
it was my public duty and I am a
researcher in my day job so it only
makes sense I had to research the what
the fuck movie was about snapchat squad
knows how that went
there was so many characters so I
couldn't decide on one single theme for
my nails so I went with like three we
got the Harley Quinn hair gradient and
tattoos on two of my nails I got the
crazy Joker laughing on my nails
probably laughing on my friend and the
background of one of the Suicide Squad
posters because I really liked the color
scheme
I used to crap ton of different polishes
you can check them out all down in the
links below if you like let's start off
with the Harley Quinn nails yes my
pointer nail is very warped blame my
fingernail suicide first I'm going to
apply some off-white nail polish because
her hair is not only completely bleached
white it's like a over chemically
processed blonde that's thirsty for
moisture yeah that's the kind of color
we're going for then we're gonna apply
some liquid latex around our finger cuz
we're gonna do a gradient just like in
Harley Quinn's popsicle hair dye job I
wanted to make the color a little bit
more off-white than white so I mixed in
some creamy beige polish to get the
perfect color of platinum hey what do
you know it kind of looks like vanilla
pudding pudding pudding I'm just going
to assume that Harley Quinn was drunk
and instead of saying puddin which he
really meant to say to the Joker was
stop putting me in the face of death you
asshole you can see I've created a nice
gradient blend here using a makeup
sponge and bonus the blue is a linear
hollow so we do have a little bit of
hollow in this manicure and now it's
time to peel off simply peel like no big
deal come on puddin peel it then you're
gonna add a nice thick coat of quick dry
glossy taco it tastes much better than
pudding I assure you and you're gonna
let that dry for a good half an hour
because now we're gonna use some acrylic
paint take a tiny tiny paintbrush
probably as small as the Joker's damaged
tattoo on his forehead I mean why are
all the other tattoos on his body so
huge but the one on his forehead is so
tiny so as you can see I'm painting on a
diamond because I'm bored play with me
and I'm using the toothpick trick to
carve out those little lines because I
would not have been able to paint the
four diamonds by themselves but oh
what's that it's time for what's on my
other hand well ignore that tiny paint
swatch from doing this nail art but this
polish my friends is my newest and
latest collaboration polish packed with
lots of Hollow
plus some color shifting shimmers and
it's basically a galaxy in a bottle it's
sold out on the first day when it
launched but by the time you watch this
video it might be back in stock I put
the link below if you want to check it
out back to scratching and cheating at
free-handing the toothpick trick is
better than any trick that the Joker
could do just saying now that one of
your Harley Quinn nails is all tatted up
you can add a nice thick coat of glossy
tack oh you got all dressed up from my
on my pinky now I did her other half of
her head colouring and made a teeny tiny
heart with two dots using a dotting tool
and then kind of merge them together
with a tiny brush try not to mess it up
shaking and that's that pretty easy
right alright now let's do the Suicide
Squad background movie poster looking
nails first I'm going to add a peel-off
base coat which I did do on my other
nails I just didn't film it fortunately
at the time of editing this video I'm
still wearing these nails so there won't
be any peel porn for you in this video
but the show must go on so I've added a
base color and now I'm gonna put some
liquid latex around my nail because
we're gonna get messy all over again now
I'm gonna make a gradient to kind of
match the poster background and the best
part is that the background is really
not perfect that means anyone can do
these nails it's basically just a bunch
of color blotches smushed together that
don't make sense you know what else
doesn't make sense the Suicide Squad
movie okay I may not have read any of
the comics or know any of the background
story at all
but why was there a witch in that movie
isn't there like a general rule that you
either have to have characters that are
supernatural like witches and demons and
vampires and wolves and whatever or you
have the superhero type characters that
was everyone else in the movie then you
just have this random witch what are you
doing you're in the wrong movie but I
know why she was there okay she was
obviously trying to water marble the
earth and the humans wanted to stop her
because water marbling is a great
responsibility with grave consequences I
should know I'm great at it also did
anyone find it weird that the Joker was
in like none of the movie he had like no
screen time what up with that one thing
I did really like about the movie though
aside from the gradient and Harlequins
hair is that one of the characters was
named after a nail art tool the crystal
katana
yeah they threw in that random girl with
the sword because her husband's soul was
trapped inside of it and we know nothing
about the backstory but she was in the
movie she's obviously a great rhinestone
picker all right back to the nail art
what what are we here for to make the
wash of neon colors look a little more
distressed like the movie poster or me
actually while I was watching the movie
trying to find the plot I took a nail
art brush with a tiny bit of paint on it
and started dry brushing around the
edges and then you just kind of keep
building up the dry brush effect like
putting some more green on it to bleed
into the other colors and next we get to
draw x marks the spot
because we're going on a treasure hunt
to make my brush really distressed and
not paint properly you basically just
smush it and ruin it I added a mix of
purple hues my suicide polish scene
going on on my yogurt lid I'm using just
a tiny bit of paint on my shitty brush
we're starting to paint the X getting a
distressed look of anything is actually
much easier than getting a realistic
appearance of anything so I highly
recommend this technique to those who
also don't know how to paint yeah not
really sure though what the triangles
are supposed to be is that his nose I
don't know and there you go your nails
are squad goals now I'm just gonna add a
nice thick coat of glossy taco to smooth
it all out you could also use a matte
topcoat here that would look pretty cool
but personally I prefer my glossy taco
because it makes it nice and thick now
on my thumb my free hand painted the
hahahaha for the Joker but I didn't
record it because do you know how hard
it is to film your thumb yeah not
happening and now we're done
yay Suicide Squad nails question would
you die for these nails yes of course
you would that's too easy would you live
for these nails um I guess so that
literally doesn't make any sense but
okay what was that I should kill
everyone and end this video sorry yeah
it's the voices I'm kidding that's not
what they really said they said thanks
so much for watching and I'll see y'all
later bye
