well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again and it's time that I leave
this tiny room that does that enough
room for all my nail polish yup your
girl is finally moving I've been in here
for six years moving also means that I
have to pack over 2000 bottles of glass
with nail polish inside of them if
you've been follow me on snapchat you
will have known that we've been living
elsewhere for almost two months now and
just coming back here to film every
weekend which does mean that you will no
longer see this room in my videos
anymore but instead you'll get to see my
new nail polish room that's right we're
dedicating a room to nail polish now let
me just let you in on a little secret
I'm excited as hell for we hired custom
shelf builders to build me custom nail
polishes like who does that this girl I
cannot wait to show you guys the shelves
you're gonna freak but okay anyways calm
down
today is a sad day but you know it's a
time of change I got some newspaper some
bubble wrap some plastic bins and
cardboard boxes and I think I have a
good packing strategy in mind to try and
reduce the number of breaks or
preferably keep it at zero there will be
no tragedy is during this move I cannot
afford any casualties where do I even
begin wait a second ban ban ban ban oh
thank you sir thank you guys sir oh my
god you got me a venti
obey I wonder if this will take as long
as it took me to get to polish Mountain
hey children Oh dusty why does no one
ever clean this place it's so dusty in
here okay bitches you're coming with me
oh I think I'm just gonna take two at a
time roll it and then add two more make
ourselves nice little nail polish
sandwich and pack in like a lunch
although I might need breakfast lunch
and dinner
this is what happens when you spend four
years collecting nail polish hi welcome
back to another episode of Hoarders on
today's episode we have a troubled young
woman who goes by the name simply
illogical this addiction has become such
a problem than it has alienated her from
her friends and family
in fact she no longer has friends I need
my friends
alright now we got three little burritos
and nail polish and in between the
layers of burritos I'm gonna put more
bubble wrap so that's like the tortilla
or the taco
oh speaking of tacos when you guys gave
me this
you put a glass of taco in a taco oh
look it's a little mini pottery face
what do you guys made this for me why is
it on my nail polish oh I don't know oh
my knees hurt I'm such an old woman I
can't sit like that wait a second
there we go okay perfect it might be
wondering how long it took me to grow
such a collection to this size I would
say I've always kind of had nail polish
as long as I can remember but my use of
nail polish never necessitated the need
for a shelf until around the time when I
actually started my youtube channel
that's when I posted nail art photos and
that's it but I've always been addicted
to hollow even before it was a trend
okay I have proof I might abandon blog
from 2014 actually I used to keep a
spreadsheet of every single nail polish
that I own because I love Excel
spreadsheets then I got out of hand and
I didn't even have time to update it
anymore so sad for a day to nurse when
you don't have data entry everyone likes
to collect things you know everyone has
their thing some other youtubers might
collect Lamborghinis or perche bracelets
or Gucci handbags I think my collection
is just you know a little cheaper to
maintain onto this row go this way and
then this way and then this way all the
way up to the top is I want to sit on my
ass as long as possible and I often get
the question how much have you spent on
nail polish I couldn't tell you off the
top of my head exactly how much because
that is not something I like to keep an
accurate record of that being said I did
get a lot of what you see here in PR so
companies sent them to me for free okay
we got one tub of nail polish down
so this shelf clearly isn't nail polish
it's a bunch of my hollow glitters and I
think we can skip the maximum packing
protection here because they're not
glass they're in plastic bottles so I'll
just divide them with one layer of
bubble wrap and you know I think they'll
be safe if we manage to break plastic
bottles in this move then it'll be like
a glitter bomb surprise when you open
this tub of because I don't get enough
of those in the mail to my fuel box from
you guys that's kind of related to one
of the reasons why we move because you
send us so much shit that we need space
for more shit
well Ben how nice of you to join me okay
I'm gonna take a food break no I'm only
like what percent is this done do I need
restock
Marvin so time to move on to boxes it
might just make it slightly heavier to
carry
50% done I've never exercised so hard in
my life I feel like I've been here for
24 years what's going on in the world
that I never enter are people still
recreating other people's tutorials hey
does someone want to recreate this our
notification still broken is baby Ariel
still a baby
is trim trim still doing banana life
hacks did the blue-eyed girl get her
Fritos I need help to finish this
mission I think I need bunion by an ban
40 no not exactly but I need you Oh
careful there those are heavy don't you
wonder time okay you sure hey then I'm
gonna show you how to wrap okay ready oh
yeah we have to go this way not the
great order man
you have to use the name of the nail
polish in the sentence
hey honey did you look like a siren
don't think that kind of Oh
like a like a Starbuck siren yeah good
thinking I think I know are you that's
what I don't want your kids this is a
fun game yeah if you had a channel I
would still one-up it you couldn't make
like a video or video game closer that's
what we need that's not us I can't
foreclosure I can't buy clothes for
yesterday I had missed calls might be a
good opportunity to get rid of some
polish
the drugstore a while ago and you're
just like looking at the nail polish and
some random what he comes up to you and
say giving you advice yeah I was just
standing the I like just observing that
you know the lack of hollow and then
some lady touch it said she should let
me know her advice and so she was OS
he's a great brand you should try now
right okay thank you
oh my god it's my teeth we're almost
there man your side is looking a little
look my two life accomplishments my
first YouTube play button and my
master's thesis pick a path like my
emotional capacity seriously when I
first mentioned that we were moving
everyone was like oh are you moving to
LA no that would be too predictable of a
youtuber I don't think I would fit in
also I don't really just want to be like
a famous person so just being honest
in June 2013 you built me the first
shelf the one furthest on the left
almost five years ago and then I think
they saw the Shelf for the first time on
my Instagram then eventually the nail
polish started expanding onto my like
bookshelves that I needed for school it
was becoming a problem build me a new
nail polish shelf please it's not a
problem anymore well build more shelves
just put a banana in his ear few months
after you surprised me with the second
shelf from my birthday in October well
we didn't feel that because I didn't
know that you were doing that and this
was before I even showed my face on
youtube I think carry one yeah feels
like a lifetime ago yeah and then not
even a year later after two shelves I
needed more room so I asked you for a
third shelf but then you were like oh
man this is the third time I've had to
build a shelf why don't I just build you
two shows at the same time so you build
number three and four together and that
was in our shelf building video
and I fucked them up right I mismeasured
the number of shelves so that doesn't
make any sense does it and that was
after you were so confident in measuring
multiple times every fourteen point
eight centimeters if you want to put
eight shells or the better you do a job
of measuring at the beginning less
likely you try to make mistakes less
likely you are to make mistakes and they
got better as they went like next one
does not look good there's like nails
popping out of it it's all slanted but
then they progressively get better as
you shift that way the shelves are
actually sloping because of the weight
of the nail polish I guess we didn't
reinforce the middle of the board at the
back board at all I just didn't use a
level even I don't think right so that's
why in our new home we hired
professional shell builders you didn't
trust me to do it you know I think
thanks to YouTube and thanks to you guys
we could afford to pay someone to build
the shelves and not put fence through
that again so Ben thanks you guys very
much for that support yes thank you want
to hear a real throwback so in my
abandoned blog I once wrote in August of
2015 chick got really out of control and
we built two more shelves by then I had
over a thousand polishes now that my
entire office wall is covered in shelves
there's really no more room to store any
nail polish which is why I'm saving for
a bigger house winky face I have over
2,000 nail polishes now I just I stopped
counting
I've been keeping some in boxes and a
closets been spilling out into the condo
as well it's in our kitchen we haven't
had a kitchen table in years because I
use
as my office desk that's where I sit all
night editing videos or we had like one
spotter on the couch that you could sit
because the rest was covered in
children's male toys it is kind of sad
and a way to leave it but the change
will be a good one because we will have
a much more functional space I want to
know what your favorite memory is from
this room comment down below say hallo
well I think it's time to take the
shelves down and in my next video you'll
get to see the new shelves so excited
I'm so excited for my new shelves I'm
sorry I mean I love your shelves thank
you for building them when you're
putting them on you should count and see
how many you have alright everybody
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
y'all next time
and my new nail polish crew
what the fuck is this this is why we
hire professionals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
