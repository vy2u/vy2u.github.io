again you just clicked on a nail related
video yes my channel has come to this
today we're going to be testing out what
looks like magical pure chrome in a
bottle a nail polish bottle this is the
one night stand mirror manicure polish
by model's own yes that's the same
models own that makes the gold nail
polish reportedly valued at one hundred
and thirty thousand dollars but this one
is nowhere near that much thank God
because I don't want to have to ask my
wallet if it was worth it again Wow guys
what the fuck is this magic silver
witchcraft this does not look like
normal nail polish to me and it does not
apply like normal nail polish look at
that shit what are you seeing that falls
right into place and turns into a mirror
you think before I actually get into how
it works some comparisons and what I
think of it I want to take you down the
rabbit hole
because this is what happens when you
leave Christina alone with the Internet
okay so models own mirror manicure
according to models owns own Twitter
models owns owns foot what their world's
first chrome polish dropped on July 14
and if you go back in their Instagram
the first time you see the stuff
mentioned is on July 6 so holy shit
that's cool this is the world's first
chrome polish right Rob a simple google
search will reveal that there was in
fact another world's first chrome polish
before the model grown one back in late
March / early April of this year there
were so many news articles written about
the CIA liquid chrome mere manicure the
original world's first liquid mere nail
polish but then shit gets weirder now I
tried to buy the CIT a mere polish as
soon as it came out and it would be
really helpful if I was able to get it
so I could compare it to the models own
polish we were sold out pretty much
immediately as soon as a launch it has
not to my knowledge ever been restocked
since unless I missed it because I was
unable to get my hands on it I thought
well let me just look at some nail
bloggers review of the CIA stuff and
maybe they can show us how it really
works and if it's the same as the models
own I cannot find one single review of
the CIA mere manicure polish on lot by
actual people who aren't the company
just like makeup bloggers who will
review products and post pictures there
are nail bloggers and normally if you
type in the nail polish and then swatch
or review you would find a bunch of
blogs or YouTube videos or even just
pictures posted on Instagram I couldn't
find even one like even one for review
or swatch that was not made or published
by CIA or on one of those news articles
where they got the pictures from CIA if
I am wrong and someone is able to find
me a review by an actual person that is
not affiliated with CIA and please let
me know down below in the comments I am
hoping that my Google skills are just
rusty something is going on here
looking through see ah cheese Twitter
feed I then found this comment first
really I guess the one born pretty store
has had for over a year doesn't exist
roast and that's right there was another
world first mere polish and it looks
like it dates back to at least February
of 2016 and there were even news
articles about it in the summer shortly
after that so what the fuck is going on
here people okay this is a chrome nail
polish conspiracy theory Shane Dawson
why aren't you investigating this okay I
mean it's not that relevant for most
people but shut up now I would have
gotten the mere polish from born pretty
store so I could see if it was the same
as the models own but every other time I
order from them I just never get my
order in any case it seems to me like
we've been lied to I don't know why this
is so important but now you have some
more knowledge in your brain you're
welcome ooh look at the shiny mirror
ball in the package that is trippy all
right let's can use it we start off with
the two-in-one basin top coat I'm not
liking where this is going already it
looks like a clearish milky water-based
top flash-based coat if you ask me then
you take the chrome II polish you shake
it well open the bottle and it might
hear how different it looks than real
nail polish I mean look at how that shit
applies it is so weird and so different
it has a very liquidy formula I would
say that the viscosity levels are quite
low here
it applies more like a thin oil rather
than a thicker lacquer if that makes
sense and it seems like it really only
takes one coat for full opacity however
I found it a bit tricky to not leave
brushstrokes so you can do a second coat
just to kind of even that out just to
experiment I put it over a black nail
polish to see if it made it any more
reflective I don't really think it made
a difference
after the chrome is completely dry
you're supposed to add the two in one
Bay slash topcoat to seal it in oh god
oh boy
what okay maybe it's like one of those
foil top cooks that dries clear so let's
see now generally you do have to be
patient for these things but I waited
eight and a half minutes this time lapse
is eight and a half goddamn minutes in
real time if you ask me that's way too
long for a taco to dry and it kind of
dulled the chrome yeah you can
definitely see the lacks my reflection
at the bottom of the nail there damn it
you know I love me some holo tacos and
some glassy tacos but sometimes other
kinds of tacos do the ruined shit but
will other kinds of non models own
suggested top coats work conspiracies
here here's a regular quick dry glossy
taco clearly that shit just eats it
here's a gel topcoat and it seems to
have smudged the chrome underneath but
let's cure it anyways and yes it did
make some of the chrome loses reflection
just making one of the experiments some
model own base and top coat how about we
try my favorite peel off base coat hmm
doesn't seem to be dulling it that much
but it doesn't want to stick to the mail
there's some scientific things happening
there that I cannot explain last I tried
a foil topcoat these are normally used
so you don't ruin the reflection of
foils and nail art and then the last
nail at the very end on the left is just
the chrome polish with no taco on top
what are we saying I think these two
options had the least dulling of the
reflection effect but still my
conclusion is that nothing looks as
shiny as just the chrome polish by
itself now how about we do some
comparisons a few years ago OPI came out
with this chrome polish called push and
shove you were supposed to use it by
itself with no topcoat so they probably
know what's up and while this polish was
pretty silver and kind of reflective it
was still nowhere near what actual
Chrome or a mere finish would look like
there's so many other polish brands that
have also made polishes they've called
chrome but really there
kind of like dull chrome not real mere
chrome until now it seems checkout my
dance moves
we've also in the past year in the nail
community discovered chrome powder I
have six different brands here that I'm
just going to quickly go through I've
made a video before about the multi
chrome colored chrome powders say that
ten times fast as well as the holo
powders but I'll show you guys how the
chrome powders work spoiler it's exactly
the same as the other powders you paint
your nail black you put on a glossy gel
taco you don't have to use gel polish
you can use a regular sticky or tacky
base or topcoat but I'm just using gel
because honestly this how it works the
best
and you pick up what looks like some
chrome coke with an eye shadow
applicator and buff it straight on or
rub it right into the gel taco on your
nail that you just chaired dust off the
excess powder and then add another gel
topcoat to seal it in and this will not
ruin the finish at all just for
experiments sake I tested out six
different chrome powders that I have at
home and these are the two that I
personally like the best in terms of
their reflectiveness a review of all six
chrome powders is kind of out of scope
for this video so I'm going to skip that
I will link down below the two chrome
powders that I personally like the best
in terms of their reflectiveness oh wait
shit guys this packaging is so
reflective that you can see my new
hollow merch that's right we got hollow
it's me and homosexual plaintiffs in
stock now because it August and summer's
almost over got the hollow printed on
colored tanks which is fun and we also
added some silver hollow foil on the
tanks and the t-shirt it's the same
newer flexible material as a rose gold
and triple frost hollow foil how about
that for a little self promo I put the
link down below so you can get your
hollow eye so where were we the main
question is how did the chrome nail
powders compare to the liquid chrome
nail polish and here we can see me we've
trying to wave at you and now I'm
playing piano with the powders you're
going to see a little bit of the
disbursement of the pigment and as a
result it's going to have a bit more of
a shimmer effect whereas with the
model's own chrome nail polish it's a
much cleaner me
finish that's kind of a brighter silver
all right what do you guys say we put
this shit on my nails finally that means
I'm going to have to peel this off it's
my twenty five hundred dollar manicure
for only twenty five dollars worth of
product so sad but hey at least you get
peel pause I apologize that I acted
sense but as it turns out my peel point
is of two hots for YouTube I mean I
can't blame them I am going full frontal
and damn girl look how long I'm getting
so on my bare nail I went in with their
twin one base and top coat first out of
curiosity and because I wanted to peel
it off I did try putting on my peel off
base coat first and then the models own
milky base coat but yeah that chemistry
was not working out well like the foil
talked coat was eating into the peel off
base coat so yeah that's that doesn't
work all right back to model's own base
coat only once it's fully dry then we
start applying the mere chrome polish on
the nail and boy she was tricky because
this polish is so liquidy it's extremely
sensitive to pooling so I would
recommend only leaving a little bit on
your brush if you leave too much it's
just going to fall all over your cuticle
and I found that this stuff wasn't the
easiest to take off my skin because
acetone just kind of spread it around I
could definitely see that applying this
nail polish would be really frustrating
for the average person applying nail
polish and although one code is opaque
you can completely see all the
brushstrokes in my first attempt and
that's because it seems like you really
have to make sure your brush strokes are
completely straight which is almost
impossible when you're going up around
the size of your nail so I had to be
super careful when going back on the
second coat and try to do only straight
line I did the best I could and what do
you think what do you think
and there we have it though to be honest
I am pretty impressed with how reflected
this is given that historically we've
only really had nail polish that's this
kind of dull silver chrome it never
actually looks like a mirror and it
makes me wonder what the hell is in this
stuff because it clearly doesn't behave
like nail polish to me he can fear he's
here in fact back in the day when I was
a teenager I used to help out at my
dad's auto body shop and they had a
paint that gave this exact same effect
it was called Mira chrome by alpha look
at this memory at work here and it was
the closest thing that looked like
chrome but that wasn't chrome and was
still actual paint the way the nail
polish applies so thin and kind of
dissipates as it shimmers reminds me of
how the chrome car paint behaved now I'm
not about to pretend I'm a scientist
here and tell you that the ingredients
are the same because obviously there's
going to be different ingredients and
what you put on your body than what you
paint the car with but because this just
behaves nothing like nail polish and
behaves more like car paint in my
experience and it looks like we found
ourselves in another conspiracy ok I'll
stop there I don't want to get sued the
instructions say that the polish will
only last around 6 hours before the
shine starts to go down and that's with
their talk so I decided let's put this
near polish on my other hand
and use their actual top coat and see
just how long it left I do want to point
out that the nails on my other hand is a
little bumpier and less smooth than my
main hand that's because I have exam on
this hand so it causes more ridges and
little pits in my nails not a big deal
not a problem most of the time but when
you wear chrome polish that's highly
reflective you're gonna see more of the
imperfections in your natural nail
I put the models on top and base coat on
and even within the same hour that I was
filming this I saw this shit start to
develop on the tip of my thumb and for
most people painting with your opposite
hand is going to be trickier than
painting with your dominant hand and
with this polish being so tricky it was
all the more tricky oh my God look at
all holy shit guys look what happens
when I put the mirror nails up against a
hollow background dance hollows dance
dance hollows dance
anyways what were we doing 24 hours
later my nails look like this now
remember this is the hand with no top
coat or anything so this is what happens
to the chrome with time it's completely
dulled down just from touching other
things including bedsheets and just my
fingers in my face it kind of just looks
like brushed aluminum now on my other
hand it's still more reflected because
the chrome was protected by the topcoat
but all the tips look nasty and they're
already starting to peel up and chip
that's fine I mean the polish did say
that it's only six hours even with their
top coats whoa okay that was a nail
video shit hope you enjoyed this little
throwback to just my voice and my nails
subscribe for more or maybe not all
right guys thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all later
