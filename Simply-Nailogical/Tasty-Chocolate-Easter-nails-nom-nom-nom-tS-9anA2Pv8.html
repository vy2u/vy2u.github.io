I don't know what to put in my mouth
first hallo everyone happy Easter it's
time to get excited because my nails
just got laid by chocolate chickens of
course so I went to the store I bought
all this chocolate and then I was gonna
eat all this chocolate but then I
realized hey what do you know all these
chocolates are wrapped in foil let's put
it on our nails also has anyone realized
that Kinder Surprise comes in a regular
version and a pink version for girls
females you must choose the pink kinder
or else you are not woman kinder
obviously failed to realize that all
eggs come from women this must be why
they are banned in America these eggs
are just so sexist
that it's criminal it has nothing to do
with the fact that there's a toy inside
the chocolate eggs eggs eggs glorious
eggs okay he'll let's get to it
the first thing you got to do is collect
the foil you do this by unwrapping the
eggs here's the tip don't leave your
chocolate eggs under hot lights for an
hour while you're filming filler footage
next I should probably take off my nail
polish but I really don't want to
because it's so pretty and so hollow but
we don't peel it off of course because I
never wear glitter polish without a
peel-off base coat I also never put
chocolate on my nails without using a
peel-off base coat first now give me
some chocolate yay I'm just painting my
nails with a very plain basic boring
brown creme polish this is a very rare
moment in simply no logical history next
you're gonna take your Easter candy
wrappers I'm gonna use the Cadbury Creme
Egg ones because I love them and I want
them all in my mouth and Cadbury's not
even paying me for this smooth out the
foil as best as you can and oh my what's
on my other
and it's a pretty hollow polish named
Moscow because I'm still on my quest to
become Russians next you're gonna cut
your chocolate wrapper down to size to
fit your nail use a pair of tiny Russian
scissors they will help a lot to try it
out for size and remember to leave a
little bit of room at the tip because
you want the chocolate to show I'm just
gonna add a little tear down the middle
of the wrapper make my nails look like I
was in the middle of feeling the wrapper
off the chocolate sumbitch stop me there
we go that's the right look there it is
add a matte topcoat to the brown polish
because chocolate looks matte and while
it's still wet quickly apply your
chocolate foil onto your nail and push
it down so it sticks I hope everyone out
there is getting some chocolate over
this Easter weekend if you're not then
your parents are dicks
and if you don't live with your parents
because you're old like me why haven't
you gone and bought all the discount
chocolate yet once the foil was all nice
and mushed down into my nail I decided
to add a glossy top coat just on top of
the foil part to make it really shiny
and pretty and egg spectacular and there
you go simple as that
you are now the queen of Easter just
keep your fingers away from any young
children and any adult stupid people who
might actually mistake your nails for
chocolate uh I'm just joking no it's
that stupid well maybe please take a
moment to egg scribe to my channel and
thank you all so very much for watching
now if you'll excuse me be right back
better go eat all this chocolate nom nom
nom nom nom I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
