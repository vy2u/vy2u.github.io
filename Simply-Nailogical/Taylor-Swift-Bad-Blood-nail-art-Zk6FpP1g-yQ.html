be Taylor Swift for badass side
obviously featuring nails inspired by
her new video bad blood cuz obviously I
was not going to do love story inspired
nails I'm generally not a fan of popular
music of the current generation but for
whatever reason Taylor Swift's bad blood
video just really got me inspired to
make some badass bloody looking nails
because who doesn't like badass I just
love nails so you've been put in
people's faces and then they're going to
say what the hell is on your nails girl
that's exactly the kind of reaction I
want and I don't care if you think that
these are supposed to be for Halloween
because I wore them in June and baby now
we got bad blood and I have to say
though Adam violate YouTube's copyright
laws
these were super easy to create using
heat trip nail vinyls from twinkle teeth
you can use my code simply for 10% off
let's get to it start with a white base
coat I always use color club's French
tip and you can grab it at the link
below and I swear one of these days I
will make a video on like what's the
best of 8 million different white nail
polishes but for now I have a job like a
job in real life that involves me
sitting at a desk five days a week not
doing my nails always I'd a quick dry
top coat before you're going to apply
nail vinyls and let that dry for about
15 to 20 minutes next I'm applying
simply peel latex carrier for easy post
gradient cleanup and you can watch my
peel off base off video if you haven't
already
I didn't plan this mani before I started
doing it which is why I covered my whole
finger but as you'll see I did more
lenient
these are my new paint drip nail bottle
so I got from twinkle tea and as I
mentioned you can use my code simply for
10% off all the nail vinyls and
everything else they so now there's two
ways to use these nail finals that is
the easy way which is peeling this part
off and sticking out your nail and then
there's the hard way of using the
inverse of the vinyl part that you're
supposed to use which is what I did
because I'm special like that at this
point it probably doesn't make much
sense why am frankensteining the crap
out of this vinyl you'll see when I peel
it off why I actually needed to use the
inverse of the vinyl part that you're
supposed to use to get the design that I
did if you look at that it's the inverse
of the paint drips which means that I'm
going to get the colored part where the
paint chips are cut out press the vinyl
firmly down on the nail and then I
realize I had a tiny bit of space I
should have probably covered up somehow
so I just added an extra swipe of simply
peel to protect it just in case that
gradient decided to sneak down there I'm
using three different polishes for this
dark bloody gradient a bright red color
Club
vampire red looking ciaté and a black
coat nail polish swipe them one by one
on a makeup sponge and start dabbing the
sponge lightly on the nail you can kind
of work it a little bit up and down to
get that nice gradient fade from red to
black huh why does it look pain blood is
red not pink
I need more coats once you're satisfied
with your bloody gradient you're going
to carefully try and peel off this very
complicated twist of simply peel and
vinyl as I realized as I was trying to
film this technical difficulties people
really only because I didn't want to
block what I was doing in front of the
camera because you actually probably
should see what I'm doing in a nail art
tutorial get out of my way simply kill
alright so the trick to peeling off
these vinyls is that you have to peel
them upwards like towards the direction
of where the paint drips in dent drippy
things are so I'm peeling it up and then
that way I won't get like the paint
drips like smearing sideways or
we don't want no crime scene
blood-spatter divine appealed up a
little bit of bloody paint here which
happens to me because I film under hot
lights so I just filled it in with a
little striping brush one question I get
asked a lot is how do you not smear dark
polish over a nail art design the first
trick is to make sure you're not pushing
down hard with the topcoat brush because
if you do that your guarantee gonna
start streaking the Polish the second
trick is after every single swipe you do
from bottom to top of the nail wipe off
the brush on a piece of paper and when
you do that you'll actually see a little
bit of color come off on the game you
got to work quickly because then you got
to do the left side and then the right
side so don't take your time with this
part and bam murder on my nails my nails
are totally ready to go and murder all
the haters in there the only thing I
think they're missing Apollo
even though you all think I'm the hollow
Queen I don't even have a good hollow
taco like what is wrong with is don't
even know this man you would be eighty
million times better if I just coated it
with Hollow and I just ordered this fun
lacquer diamond top coat from Live Love
polish I put the link below because like
look at these pictures
okay well yes I know they were taken by
a Russian nail blogger so obviously the
pictures are going to be amazing
but I mean still like look at this nail
polish I needed on my nails yesterday
don't worry you'll be the first to know
when I get it in the mail because I'll
probably put it on every single one of
my nail arts for the next two years okay
I'm gonna go start
bad blood and telling people Emma's on
me now so I'll see you next time thanks
