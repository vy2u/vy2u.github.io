well hello everyone its maker Steen
again you might be wondering why I have
39 bananas in front of me well today is
Thursday and what does my boyfriend Ben
love the most bananas and doesn't know
this yet but today we're gonna do a fun
activity together we're gonna try out
some brand new hacks brought to us by
the one and only
Thun Thun yeah you guys note room term
one of my favorite channels on YouTube
the channel that repeats all of its good
Bank thumbnails over and over again so
it's like my makeup I tried to make it
like banana sexy not really sure yellows
my color which is unfortunate
since you love bananas so much sure
we're gonna do 20 banana like bags today
and guess who we're gonna learn them
from true true ready she's gonna be
bananas look at all these thumbnail like
they're so obnoxiously photoshopped
what's in the thumbnail is never in the
actual video no but I still click what's
wrong with me let's begin 20 Aneta
light packs do we have to watch all 20
do you like bananas we have collected
plenty of banana light packs for you the
blue-eyed girl likes banana glue and I
will make a special banana holster for
trace a banana up to the stems on a
piece of felt trace the same part making
a big allowance like 20 bucks that's how
much these girls are paid to be in these
videos copy them on the second piece of
felt so thin and thick details wrong
sides out this is a lot of work for a
banana holster don't worry about it I'm
gonna rewind so we can follow the steps
this is very concerned we got some green
though and I also found some hollow grab
your banana looks like we're cutting out
socks we get it your sock this is a
great video thank you having the time of
your live are you ready to flip the
banana inside out look at that I have no
idea how you did this I did it let me
see yours Ben oh I don't know I guess
you're just gonna have to go to battle
with this
I'm not doing 19 waters my friends made
an awesome banana Viking helmet
especially for this battle mark the
width of a banana on two sides of a big
plastic flower pot cut the holes where
they commuted knife put banana horns
into the holes anyway it's only a banana
game I'm gonna use the flower pot
because that's just really complicated
but create the incision make space for
your protruding bananas the brown-eyed
girl opens up a Sharpie package it's not
Sheriff it's kind of like when the
bananas are down it means you know you
got the situation everything's okay
there's an emergency girls arranged in
nail salon justice step away from a
fruit bowl and what if they get inspired
by bananas and try to do banana nails
draw one big banana on your middle
finger nail trace the outline with black
polish we've got an Andy Warhol style
banana nail art I think we've already
conquered that life hack I've done
banana nails and you've done banana day
maybe this is a sign that true shoe is a
fan of since I know much or just
anywhere ho it's almost like they're
struggling to think of 20 things to do
with bananas to include in a video what
are you guys what do we got next
are you bored you can always take a
selfie and if your photos are no use a
banana smile oh with a Bergen right that
is such a life trace the mouth in red
paint
these are lips these are less the banana
teeth match my friend - it's a universal
selfie decoration the blue line girl
likes the banana - its universal smile
I'd better do it on my own
you know do you love spending hang with
me
do you have an ugly face cover it up
with a banana I better do it on my own I
forgot to give you a sticker I really
want to meet these girls I want to save
these girls who are they what are their
names
you're not just the blue-eyed girl who
are you I was looking at a truth field
and the top comments on it was it's not
a problem anymore are you ready for the
next tap the blue eyed girl bring
something chocolate on a stick blue it's
a lie screw it's not a boring banana
anymore it's not a boring banana anymore
also I'm sorry to disappoint you I don't
have the materials required for that
particular what a banana and chocolate
okay we're skipping that's next I treat
my friend to delicious cookies take one
cup of oblate have a banana one egg and
three and a half ounces of sugar in a
separate Bowl because I wanted to make
this super fun and special we're gonna
is poop mole put the cookies on top
using a spoon and open to a microwave
for 5 minutes good Cheers
the blue-eyed girl likes the tree she
doesn't figure out at once that the
banana is the main ingredient no idea
the only thing left is to find dumbbells
the candle is way too light what candle
are they using because this candle is
way heavier than these bananas my friend
offers the solution a banana set for
exercising lift it and build up your arm
muscles and comfortable to serve as a
dumbbell she will
a banana salary in potassium poisoning
do you feel comfortable when you have to
hold a phone in your hands when watching
a video do I feel comfortable put your
phone onto a big bunch of bananas as if
on a phone holder try it out and make
the watching of the video more
comfortable the blue-eyed girl is sure
that she's a pop star her roommate is
nearly crying too and she has to put up
with the singing she sticks bananas into
her ears it's such a relief
peace and quiet I'm gonna sing you a
song okay you're gonna protect yourself
Oh cuz bananas don't fit in your ears
that should've been the dumbell banana
in your ear ah missed opportunity I feel
like these hacks are just getting more
and more low-effort as we go on putting
less and less buttons a the phone stand
just put your phone on a banana you
don't want to hear something just shove
a banana in your ear
okay ready for the next one I am if you
want to plant a cactus into a new pot it
stings and doesn't let itself be caught
put the banana peel on the cactus and
take out the prickly plants put the
cactus onto the new pot and add more
soil don't you have this problem all the
time you know you want to replant your
cactus and you don't know how to touch
it well it won't be a problem anymore
because we got a cactus and we got a
bunch of bananas no I can touch it
that's such an appealing cactus that
looks like a true tree thumbnail replant
the cactus I wait my plant every hour
what should I do
if it is always dusty using a banana
peel is a great idea that can help wipe
every leaf with the soft part of the
peel now it won't get dusty oh my god
now it's not dusty it's just covered
this life hack can also be applied to an
old leather handbag rub the inside I
think you have some old leather shoes we
could buff I like these shoes I don't
want him covered it better know their
dusty that old we got to restore this
leather their nice shoes those are
expensive one day if you make room too
you can buy yourself a new pair what did
you think was going to happen should
watch youtube videos to figure out what
you don't want to do with your life
squeeze paints onto a banana as though
it is a palette mix the colors on the
banana and paint your picture isn't a
banana heck it's an any inanimate object
grab a hat grab a plate grab a paper
towel like you can do this on anything
this is so stupid I'm getting upset
serenity now my heart is banana so I
made you a beautiful painting and you
made true German I was inspired by the
blue-eyed girl just Jim Jim have a p.o
box we can mail these to them stick all
the scattered pins into a banana let's
arrange needles and a murder Anna just
don't forget to take out all the needles
before you want to eat it just when you
think they can't get any dumber are you
done for the day
that feels good it should have just said
this was a way to decorate a banana and
then feed it to your worst enemy I think
this is the last one a banana necklace
take banana chips make a hole in the
center I look like a real jungle
princess with this accessory if there is
a famine in my kingdom I can always eat
my necklace
oh is it just me or did anyone else feel
really uncomfortable listening to her
explain that it's like it's an alien
trying to relate to humans I'm not into
bad I'm not
been made like a banana and split
well
ringing bananaman dr. Liu please come
back don't leave me alone I need my
friends did you like our banana ideas
then write in your comments which
lifehack you like the most you should
comment on this video I'm actually
impressed with how bad and useless all
20 of them were we'd almost expect them
to come up with like a good or useful
one by accident well I don't want to
read that to me
my favorite hack was blue my girls are
freedom dear blue-eyed girl if you need
help
blink three times quickly and mouth it's
not a problem anymore okay so um 39
bananas were murdered in the making of
this video
happy birthday dear banana everyone wish
then happy birthday in the comment did
you enjoy your birthday celebration of
20 banana life acts
no is this one like hack videos it like
now or is true trim especially like this
that's a good research question and
something I would like to explore
further in a future study where we
analyze hack videos on YouTube really
wonder what like these people making
these videos thick is it just like oh
this is a cash cow we know it's gonna
get a lot of quicks
I would assume that most of them are
pretty self-aware that what they're
putting out is just stupid but you know
they excuse it by calling and
entertainment and it's not like
personality driven is only the ideas
they don't even have names who are the
true moon women there's a group of them
that rotate that's the kind of you
see in link I didn't want to say it but
underground networks of things that are
bad news I wonder how many people
watching videos like this think that's
what I want to do when I grow up I want
to light packs when I'm in adults
bananas will not solve your life
problems
I must there's a famine in your kingdom
before stay in school kids school
alright guys thanks so much for watching
