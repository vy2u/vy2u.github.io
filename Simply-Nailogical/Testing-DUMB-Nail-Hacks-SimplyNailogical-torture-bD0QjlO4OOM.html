about nail art or nail hacks and we're
gonna test out the most dumb ones so you
can witness me looking like a dumbass
that's what I do every week that's why
you subscribed well hello everyone it's
me Christine again welcome back to your
favorite nail Channel
Benji is here with me today as well she
is hibernating in a pumpkin until
Halloween is here some of you guys have
been asking for me to test out dumb nail
hacks and I love that idea because I'm a
scientist Christine the science Queen
Christie the science Queen okay back to
the video we're gonna start with a video
because when I'm looking for dumb I
turned to YouTube eight to nail hacks
nail art hack compilation by truned room
but before we test the hacks let's have
a little reaction time first shall we
got to get that room truth is that I get
that room truth yes okay let's go
why are these mothers hanging out in
their children's room are you in a hurry
to meet your friend use an art brush to
correct your nail polish mistake the
narrator sounds like either she's being
held hostage or she needs friends look
she wrote let's be friends I told you
she needs friends it's gonna be a no
from me my friend wants to eat a banana
your friend is the hope but I need it
urgently I have a banana emergency I
need to shove my fingers just eat the
banana damn it Ben would have eaten that
banana are you fond of straight line
design answer are we seeing the same
diamond because those lines are not
straight cut out a tape square bitch
ever heard a male vinyls remove the tape
my friend is going to have tea tea I
like your friend better than you well if
your nail is broken maybe you should
watch my how to grow your nails video
this teabag hack actually works for you
true-true
what about toothpaste for nails why not
you can make them whiter as well as your
teeth it's not a problem anymore if your
nails have turned yellowish because of
polish the massage will remove yellow
stains making your nails lighter and
making them look healthy it's not a
problem anymore it's not a problem
anymore it's not bitch it was never a
problem I've said it countless times
before but I will say it again
yellow nails don't matter because it's
literally just the color of your nails
it doesn't affect anything including the
strength or health of your nails my
supporting eyes are yellow because
underlying health issues but in the case
of most people who wear nail polish all
the time like myself it's almost always
just the result of staining I don't have
liver failure or a crack cocaine
addiction
they just yellow because I use a lot of
dark polishes and and that's James I
don't know why my yellow nose offend
people it's like you guys are racist
against nails now to test the first dumb
hack just to humor you trim trim so
here's my nails before take note of how
yellow and kind of orange they are well
it is almost Halloween so I'm a candy
corn I've got a toothbrush here it's
Ben's trim trim said to scrub for 2 or 3
minutes so here we go
and as you can see well it definitely
looks like it's somewhat reduced the
yellowness or the orange enos of my
nails they're still definitely not white
that and it looks as if my nails got the
life sucked out of them because you can
actually see the roughness on the
surface and some splitting of the top
layers of my nails and that's not a good
thing because that just like
buffing your nails only weakens your
natural nail and when your nail is weak
it gonna break and then you're gonna
need that teabag hack must restore
moisture to my nails you find out more
about how I made this nail oil pen
myself in my how to grow your nails
video well twice what else do we get
what else do we get sixteen male hacks
the last one was 18 take three little
beads that she was gonna say take three
little ease
I hate eyeshadow as polish it's
PSA this is warning to everyone the
lemon juice has a natural whitening
effect we'll see double protection and
it changed me okay cute tomb trim I'm
moving on to blogs so lots of you guys
tweeted this dip Li to me why would
you name your website dip Li like all I
can think of is easy peel off
glitter nails paint a layer of craft
glue on your nail and let it dry before
using your regular polish peel the glue
and the glitter will come with it for an
easy and mess free cleanup oh yeah
alright now dip League gives like zero
information on how to actually execute
the hack because all of their sources
are other people and blogs
back number two okay that's enough
I was never a waitress and you just take
a little paint brush dip it in the glue
and paint it right on the nails now long
time holo sexuals who've been following
my channel will remember that a long-ass
time ago I made a video on what's the
best peel-off base coat and in that
video I concluded that I hate
glue I gotta wait for this to dry
so I'm just gonna put some snapchat
filters on her face okay looks like it's
dry now so we gonna apply some glitter
polish and then she requested that we
use her holo polish she's so pretty and
pink and sparkly and you can get it at
the link below and find her college
education now never said
anything about using a taco but I know a
topcoat makes the peel work butter no we
gotta get it glossy taco I had an ass
dick coated glas.t taco all right now we
gotta let it dry so in the meantime why
don't you go subscribe got me a little
wooden stick and then you would just
gently push it off that it's not coming
off in one nice clean peeling yeah we're
having the same thing happen again it's
not peeling up in one nice peeling and
this is not good for your nails either
to keep like picking and scratching at
them I just want to say that I totally
realize and understand that the glue may
be a good alternative for some people
who don't or can't spend money on a peel
off base coat so for all intents and
purposes it does work it just doesn't
work that well in my opinion like look
at this I don't have any peels to add to
my peeling eggs
you see I'm not a crazy person who just
says that they keep all their nail peels
I actually do keep all of my nail pili
but not this nope this is
going straight in the trash the hollow
trash hey look it's me
anyway so I apologize for the shitty
pealed porn in tonight's show if you
would like a refund feel free to comment
down below what other dumb hacks you go
after me Internet boring boring we've
seen that before
stop trying to change me I can hate
these websites you have to click next
page like every single item that they
show you they're so greedy they want my
ad revenues they should be a youtuber
here's another post 12 nail art hacks
you've never heard of once to bet that
we've heard of them all I've done the
digging so prepare your hash tag nail
life spelt with a why to get a heck of a
lot easier
who wrote this what kind of you
hire no nail polish remover to get rid
of stray polish just use some topcoat
what there's literally no other
explanation well what does she mean okay
let's see if we can find a source for
this Instagram great great but I would
think based on the picture a reasonable
person would conclude that she is
putting topcoat on the parts of her
finger where she got nail polish on her
finger and that maybe when you do that
then you can wipe it off that sounds
really dumb perfect let's test it I got
it all over my skin oops now I have here
some drugstore glossy taco in a taco one
of you smart asses sent this to me to my
p.o box and I'm just gonna put it
directly on the nail polish that I
messily got all over my finger cuz today
we forgot how to paint on nails take a
q-tip and we're gonna oh my god it's
kind of working
what the okay so it kind of works
weird
oh okay I spoke too soon your see it may
have removed the Polish but the top coat
left my skin all sticky and disgusting
to be honest it's kind of like how you
would expect your skin would feel if you
put glossy taco my fingers are sticky I
don't feel comfortable with this even
though I wiped off the glossy taco
everywhere I put it there's a thin
residue and now I'm gonna have to go get
my nail polish remover anyways oh my god
is that my picture why the is my
 on this what's next once
you've perfected that paint job dip your
hands and ice to quickly seal your
designs dip your hands and ice dip our
hands and ice into what props to your
editor dip Li okay so I've seen this a
million times on the Internet it
allegedly makes the nail-polish dry
faster but personally I've always
thought it was but today we
gonna try it for you think it's safe to
assume that maybe people are using this
hack India of quick dry top coat so I
just painted my nails straight up and
did not add a quick dry top coat let's
dip these two in cold how long am I
supposed to do this for it doesn't say
elsewhere on the internet it says icy
water for two to three minutes
I don't know if I can handle that the
torture is frostbite huh first let's do
the fingerprint test and so yes I'm
still seeing a fingerprint on my ice
bath water now yep they both not dry now
what about a light stabbing test my
favorite
I'm only tapping lightly but I'm digging
right through the pouch and when I
lightly tap on the other now it's not
really going all the way through I mean
if I stab it really hard then yes I'm
gonna pull up the Polish but I think
that there's a huge difference here and
what the stab test at least is showing
us is the fatal flaw of the ice bucket
method so from what I understand after
reading other internet posts which also
aims to debunk the myth of the quick
drying ice bucket challenge the ice
water just hardens the very surface of
the nail polish so it doesn't actually
dry anything but what happens with nail
polish is you have like one or two or
three coats which means that when you
push on your nail the nail polish
underneath the very surface isn't dry
yet so if you want to be able to smush
your manicure around like this then sure
use an ice bath to dry your neck okay
definitely what are you doing this nail
hack is dumb tip Lyra Minds me of
BuzzFeed garbage look it's so not dry I
can kind of peel it off okay not really
that's just that's just ugly that's ugly
all right we got time for one more dumb
hack a tampon really really that
actually sounds like a smart idea
because tampons are made of cotton but
the idea of using a tampon to remove
your nail polish does sound a little
silly so let's try it I love internet
melt
never thought I'd be teaching you this
on my channel but release the cotton
let's just dip the Tam P into the nail
polish remover it's so absorbent that
it's like barely wet with acetone
anymore
this tampon is one thick bit this hack
is actually not a bad idea if you'd
already done your other hand because I
wouldn't want to ruin what's on my other
hand look at that smooth smooth
transition yeah it's a beautiful linear
hollow paint polish that I don't want to
ruin because it's beautiful and
hallow Wow this is actually not
that dumb except I've kind of run out of
free white space wonder if we can like
use the side of it do you think that
nevermind
there you have it dumb nail hacks that I
tested from the internet but I know that
there's far more don't nail hacks
waiting to be tested I love it when you
guys shared them with me so if you
come across any other dumb hacks don't
forget to tweet me on Twitter you can
leave the comment down below too but by
tweeting me on Twitter there's a higher
chance that we'll actually see it
because that is where my audience is
smallest which means I see more of the
things you guys say so don't too many
people follow me because I like to keep
it that way
as a general commentary on all these
hacks that will change your life for
hats you've never seen before in my
opinion a lot of it is recycled
by that I mean very rarely will you find
any of these hack channels or websites
sharing an original idea they're just
taking that they've seen elsewhere
and then repackaging it and I don't just
mean nail hacks I mean like life hacks
and whatever hacks and they'll
call the video like twelve life hacks
you've never seen before and really they
saw all those hacks before because they
took the ideas from some other channel
that did the same I'm not being
funny or maybe I am bitch my point is
that this is very commonplace on YouTube
to just recycle garbage life hacks
recycled personalities why am I still
here just to suffer all right I'm gonna
go drink some tea play house with my
cats and go through my pili bag
subscribe thanks so much for watching
and I'll see y'all
