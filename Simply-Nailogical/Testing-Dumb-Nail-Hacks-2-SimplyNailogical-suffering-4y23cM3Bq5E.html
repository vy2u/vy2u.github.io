a right well hello everyone
it's me Christine again and there's
shitty sunset on my eyes testing dumb
nail hacks number two because there's
just so much dumb shit on the internet
that I can make more than one video
about this where do we even begin so I
know let's see how our friends at trim
trim are doing since I filmed my last
dumb nail hacks video trim trim has
uploaded not one but two more nail
related hack compilations what the fuck
are these thumbnails though like it's
all the same shit weird ways to sneak
makeup into class in a Apple 30 million
views and obviously we know that
whatever they do in the video is not
gonna look anything like that thumbnail
you want to see for yourself
assemble the weird makeup holder I apply
my eyeshadow straight from the Apple
here it is my natural mate see what the
fuck why do we click on this okay
anyways old ladies simply it's gonna get
back on track 14 nail hacks nail art
hack compilation
party here
long and sharp no we're not talking
about pepper you're saying the pepper
wars begins there's a pepper war make
some heat per one teaspoon of cayenne
pepper water and hand cream in a double
boiler double boiler stir well apply the
mask you can do it once a month
not more enjoy watching your nails grow
fast or else what what happens if I do
it more than once a month do I die so
let me get this straight
Truman Truman are you saying that the
peppers are just so hot and so spicy
that it makes your nails want to just
grow right up out of your skin I'm not
sure it just makes sense why how
explicitly I guess we're gonna have to
ask Google cayenne pepper nails benefits
let's see natural remedies for nail
focused I don't see anything about nail
growth just treating nail fungus trim
trim did you not do your homework but
you know what we're gonna try it anyways
because it's dumb
pull in a bowl of hot water one teaspoon
of cayenne pepper one teaspoon of water
and some hand cream mix that shit
together wait until cool time for a
pepper war the pepper wars begin
she looks at me like I'm stupid now trim
trim says to apply the spicy mixture to
bare nails which means it's time for
some peeled I'm naked
my collection is growing oh this is
weird
Oh God Oh
the worst thing about this is it smells
like cooking I hate cooking okay now
what do we do enjoy watching your nails
grow fast
still waiting okay obviously I know trim
trim was not meaning to suggest that
they would grow right before your eyes
but they also provided no other
information they did not explain why
putting this shit on once a month is any
better than not putting this shit on
ever alright let's watch another trim
trim because nom nom
brilliant girls
oh I see they've been replaced probably
weren't bringing in the views anymore
you know it's a tough tough room to mark
it up there I wonder if they were let go
and we're told it's not a problem
anymore okay anyways
Wendy's bitch is it this is the way your
eyeshadow can substitute for trendy
holographic powder excuse me do you just
say holographic powder trendy
holographic powder it's not a problem
anymore
I will graph it's not a problem anymore
trim trim is canceled goodbye all right
let's move away from YouTube and into
blogging territory found this website
real moms dot-com thank god I've been
looking for my real mother pick your
favorite color of lipstick and use brush
to apply lipstick on your nails let's
try it I got some lipstick
it's a sparkly pink one it's not my
favorite color but I'm okay with cutting
it up so we're just gonna scrape some
lipstick off yeah that doesn't look that
bad it's nice for lipstick on my nails
and a taco that kind of disintegrates
the nail polish I need lipstick oh my
god Braemore just okay I'm wiping this
shit off all right what else you got for
me real mothers out of nail polish
remover step 1 get lemon juice and white
vinegar in a small bowl rub your nails
with cotton to remove the nail polish
mmm let's try it
and it doesn't say anything about how
much of each I need what are the
measurements mom all right we just gonna
have to wing it since we're gonna need
to have nail polish on to test this let
me just paint my nails first Wow my
nails are looking really long these days
they it must be the cayenne pepper hack
okay now I got to let it fully dry oh oh
there man oh is that my tea yes thank
you this is not a dumb hack this is a
smart hack okay it's had over half an
hour to dry now oh wait a second did you
see what's on my other hand it's a
beautiful stunning rose gold foil polish
but of course I couldn't not top it with
a hollow taco it strikes the perfect
balance of classic upscale elegance and
Hall of sexual there's some lemon juice
when life gives you lemons make nail
polish remover in order to try this
we're gonna protect our other hand
because it's too beautiful to risk being
ruined right now it's the moment of
truth I'm going to apply pressure for a
couple seconds like I normally would and
then we kind of pull it forward and this
is the time when I would begin to see
the nail polish coming off on the cotton
pad but so far we've got absolutely
nothing let's try another fresh pad just
to make sure I'm doing this properly I'm
actually seeing nothing happened
it's not even penetrating the taco at
all it's still perfectly shiny okay
what's next let's just go on over to fab
hakam oh good I would like to learn how
to be fab please teach me how to remove
nail polish without using nail polish
remover they've got hairspray hand
sanitizer perfume white nail polish and
we did that last time and wet taco
that's pretty much the same thing as wet
nail polish now I'm personally really
curious about the perfume one because if
this works not only could you remove
your nail polish but your nails will
also smell like Julia Roberts
I do have this perfume though it's
really really old spray perfume on a
paper towel rub your nail with it to
remove the polish okay
sounds pretty simple let's try it
domestic Scottish protection on why did
I ever wear this it's kind of working
still not actually fully eating through
the Polish it's just gently rubbing off
the color okay well now I still have
nail polish on and it smells like shit
in here having a problem to dry your
nail polish spray cooking spray over the
nail polish got some cooking spray pam
pam IM what now i would suspect that
these quick dry nail hacks are supposed
to be done in you of a quick dry glossy
top coat so we're not gonna put this guy
on and instead we're gonna use cooking
spray because it's gonna work just as
good i wonder if it will be as effective
as the ice water bath we tried last time
so i've got two coats of still wet nail
polish on - oh my god hey who the fuck
thought of this I would just like to
know what idiots we're painting their
nails and cooking at the same time my
nails are swimming in a pile of wet oil
we gonna do the slip and slide I guess
let's see if it's dry oh shit that's
definitely not dry and I'm not stabbing
that hard okay maybe I'm just not
understanding the science behind this
hack but could someone please tell me
why it would make sense that putting oil
on lacquer would make it dry or harden
too many household supplies today I
think we've got time to test one more
now real mom's claims to have a solution
for spilled nail polish let's see what
it is I can't wait you're supposed to
pour sugar over the nail polish
and then it supposedly rubs off easily
seen this on a whole bunch of other
different types of hack websites and I'm
genuinely curious if this actually works
because it could have come in handy a
few years ago when I spilled on this
very hardwood floor I wasn't filming at
the time but I was painting my nails
with purple and then I left the cap off
and I knocked it over onto the hardwood
floor you can see there's still purple
nail polish in the wood grain no we're
not gonna use my actual hardwood floor
to test this we're gonna use some sample
hardwood flooring fresh from Home Depot
they thought we were buying a floor but
really really just gave us free samples
to destroy oops oh shit
trim trim help me I'm also gonna make
the spill much thicker on one side so we
can see if that makes any difference
Oh No I've spilled my nail polish on the
hardwood floor what should I do
oh let's pour some sugar on it
let's try ready what is going oh oh my
god
the nail-polish is kind of crumbling up
holy shit it's kind of working oh my god
obviously it's not completely gone but
from what I can tell it looks like the
sugar really worked at helping clump
together the thicker parts of the nail
polish it looks like a sour patch kids
I'm kind of impressed I mean obviously
it's not gonna completely remove the
nail polish but the parts where it was
thickest that shit worked alright well
that's enough housework for me for today
most of these male hacks we come across
on the Internet are usually dumb or they
just don't work except the sugar one
guys now you guys know how much I love
