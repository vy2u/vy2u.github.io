everyone it's me simply face logical
again I'm just like the regular
Christine you're used to except I
actually put effort into how I look
excuse me bitch what we have very
important business to attend to today
everybody I've been hearing a lot about
a reportedly holographic liquid
highlighter for your face hover effects
halo they call it
holographic multi dimension let's check
in with the media and see what they have
to say hover effects have launched
holographic highlighter drops that will
give you actual unicorn cheeks
holographic custom enhancer drops have
fans ready for the launch spoiler one is
holographic two made for the holographic
trend these holographic makeup items
give us life CAPITAL LETTERS but never
trust the media buy it for yourself and
come to your own conclusions right we
hope the reportedly holographic face
highlighter and her two unrelated
sisters that I bought for no particular
reason other than good marketing but is
it really all of these policies however
those who have not yet found the hollow
path of life what do we think Hollow
family could it be true
is this real Hollow or is it fake news
that would be sad let's nip to get but
first let's do the rest of our makeup
because this is an educational Channel
okay simply face logicals got things to
teach you and you got things to learn
from me I like to do my eyes first
because no matter how much baking powder
I put on my face my face always ends up
getting that what should we do today
tink um I guess so
more colors how about that not so bad
for a little me we're looking our face
right now
and now we can seal all those colors
that have stained my skin to ffffff Deb
Deb Deb Oh candy our middle of doing
cocaine don't you hate it when brushes
just read a bunch of letters and numbers
on the handle and expect you to know
what that means which one do I use for
contour just tell me already all those
who work in microfiber oh yeah don't you
just want to put them draw in all the
eyebrows if you plucked out ten years
ago put on some regular good ol my skin
because I don't feel like my fake lashes
today well one eye is blended better
than the other but if I open my eyes you
don't notice that it looks good I'm kind
of impressed with myself to be honest
okay shut up Christine we've got
important business to attend it's hollow
time it's a bottle god dropper but for
babies if I had a child I would feed it
this to wrinkles the packaging and
hollow yes shake well before use just
like nail polish
all right I'm going to give you a second
close-up view because you deserve that
Wow
last month Charlie Frey feel some like
oily but in a good way
BAM oh you can't see it I have too many
like oh oh person crushes us did
you come here for it's shiny it's
reflective it's lilac it's somewhat
color shifting but it's not hello now
let me just admit though that just
because makeup isn't true hollow doesn't
mean it's not pretty
I feel like this it looks like it's
going to do nice things to my face it's
definitely purple and it kind of shifts
from purple to blue I'd call it
iridescent maybe slightly duochrome but
it's not technically what us now Polish
people understand to be holographic
which means magical shifting rainbow
paste in place
you are big dude I want this on my face
what is so hard to understand it's like
the linear hollow powders for nails I
want to be able to put that all
over my face on my eye on my list on my
highlight or maybe just full face pens
I'm feeling okay Christine why don't you
just shut up about Hollow and just try
the product now I've seen some beautiful
people put the liquid on the Beauty
Blender mine is covered in machine hair
just take a little bit and you dab dab
dab you can't get away from that I'm
just going to turn on the brightness so
you see the highlight better oh I got a
blend it so it doesn't look like one of
those football players stripes we're
going to go up on the temple here to get
in touch with our brain so whoever
invented the beauty blogger who ever
meant to be what whoa what trends are
you smell oh that's why it was cocaine
whoever invented using a Beauty Blender
to
put liquid over powder well
through smart I guess that works and it
doesn't look cakey I just barely sure
has blended and how about that sure what
if I just put that right on the
sponge oh yeah
give me more and this is how the hollow
sexual egg is fertilized my highlight is
brighter in my future on YouTube when
the glow is too much I know who even
says that you can take the apps of the
egg and then kind of blend it in a bit
more I just made up that hack you're
welcome
holy son it's a moon get off me
okay so this side was way more than this
side I don't know how that happens about
six pack oh my love finally get why all
the beauty bloggers sound like they're
having orgasms limited on highlight
always like oh my god yes I can't I can
make it brighter bitch the is like
porn now I think we got to put some on
our nose because some some reason that's
what we do in be dealin just a little
bit just a little bit efficient use our
finger Oh liquid looks like on my
nose because my nose is so screwed right
Canadian dressed in problems if anyone
has any tips on how to not have a dry
nose let me know in the comment don't
bother commenting use moisturizer
Christine I tried it in fact I try that
every day and night how about we
accentuate our giant lips though that
can work oh is this remind you of God
holla No
well friends what do we think
to the mandatory narcissistic montage
all right
last impressions definitely quite opaque
I guess it's kind of cool that it's in
liquid because you could just put it in
yours your coffee cereal or your tea
you're a ski drinker you know mace a
judge but none
not all too well forget mixing this in
your foundation just put it in your
scrambled eggs how can this feed again
it was clearly harvested from a unicorn
now I might as well show you what her
sisters look like since in Battambang
let me just clean my hands rose-gold
whoo so pretty
Wow that is literally blinding the
camera can't handle it let's turn this
baby up sexy that is damn reflective
definitely way more reflective than the
halo formula hey now let's try blossom
mmm oh yeah well that pretty - holy
those are so nice I'm regretting not
using these on my face when you think
which one suits me for my next makeup
video through my christine stop no more
mixes are you laughing at me Ben you
think that's funny do you like my face
I'm dare you the photos man-bag
why you always leave me so so where were
we
and let's just compare all three
siblings in the hell of it so halo is
definitely quite more see-through if you
will it doesn't have quite the same
reflectiveness but it's got that
iridescent unicorn
shimmer to it oh I forgot to sample
- lets compare to that oh my gosh is
that more blinding is it possible no I
want my whole face to look like
kanockers
now I know what you're all wondering
what do these look like when you rub
them together oh yeah
oh oh me out cover my body and
it totally going to use this with shower
gel alright well this was fun I had fun
I think you to do morally I would like
to thank my Twitter family for tweeting
this at me approximately 810 today
velvety racist because you guys that I
actually become aware of products like
this so keep tweeting me and letting me
know about all the up-and-coming
beautiful people products I just want to
reiterate that we as homosexuals should
not hate companies for using pollow name
in vain although it is a very tragic
misrepresentation of our livelihood we
must learn to love and embrace companies
who simply don't understand
we must not hate them we must take their
hand let them live let them have their
fun because we have ours we know what
Brie pollo is make up companies don't
ask you understand us but we understand
each other
pollo sexual out thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
