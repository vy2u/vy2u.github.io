well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again and welcome to episode 2 of simply
hair logical oh my god is attacking so
there's this new holographic beauty
product on the rise you may have seen it
holographic hair foam and you know this
bitch has to test it what can I say I
got a reputation for calling out fake
hollow big reputation big o pick up
makeup ah I'm sorry Taylor Swift please
don't claim my video so I took my little
hollow ass to Sephora and got the
holographic careful and I took my ass to
Sephora I mean I just shopped online
I don't owe mo fear of a caller what but
before we play let's review the
marketing first shall we
this FOMO holographic hair foam is by IG
k hair and it looks like it was first
announced back in October of last year
and of course a bunch of news articles
followed suit cause everyone was shulk
this foam makes your hair holographic so
we'll take one in every color please
surprise idk launched holographic hair
phone because holographic makeup was
never enough
why do they do this they always do this
I don't even need to use this to know
that it's not real hello that is clearly
an iridescent kind of pearlized form of
duochrome pigments you can call it any
of those things but it is most certainly
not
holographic this is holographic welcome
to assembly Hollow school lesson 267 day
400 these hair phones do not have
holographic particles in them they just
have some kind of pearl eyes particle
that shifts slightly between one or two
colors sounds familiar with something
we've all seen before with fake hollow
makeup now there is overly shiny pastel
hair dyes that the media has
characterized as holographic but it's
really just different colors of dye in
different places on your head and each
strand themselves doesn't actually shift
through the spectrum of the rainbow in
fact the only way I can think of to get
straight-up holographic strands of hair
is to literally put pieces of
holographic tinsel in your hair like I
did last time on simply hair logical
with my hollow back and forth with my
hollow back and forth but yeah anyways
that's not dyeing your hair and then
there's someone like Kaylee Melissa
who's an actual hairstylist and knows
what she's doing and she went full
hollow by taping in some hollow tinsel
and packing on a bunch of hollow glitter
and even some hollow nail flakies
basically she had to resort to arts and
crafts on her head so even though I have
pathi sized that this is probably not
real hollow we're gonna test it out
anyways for the sake of science and also
because I would like to show off my hair
skills - you ready I guess first we
should brush it how is my hair still
kind of wet I showered last night the
struggles of having several feet of hair
yes I'm gonna have to blow dried just a
little bit you came for the show now
you're gonna get it though
what alright there's so many goddamn
pieces in here it's like an artillery
kit I'm going to war and it's with my
hair I've literally never seen a blow
dryer look this scared back off
get your own alligator blow dryer bitch
actually you can get it from graveyard
girl and baloney here know sponsored I
just love bunny I want to turn this on
scare Benji away
- fine come back why is everyone always
scared of me
look at this it's so long I can eat it
for dinner all right well I guess we
should straighten this mess ah Pat
talked I'm not quite sure I know the
correct technique here your girl's
trying okay I don't straighten my hair
often because it takes like two hours
simply ain't got time for this usually
I'll see you at a comment about how long
my hair is as this that's disgusting I
hear so long I must be Amish
technology's bad you know luckily my
hair is only on my head I also happen to
like my natural color I used to dye my
own hair back in the day the maintenance
of upkeeping with dyed hair is just too
much for me just easier to leave it all
natural I'm simply natural oh look at
that silky smooth not really true but it
looks silky smooth
oh shit Pantene why haven't you called
me yet you wanna see how long it is air
goes down look I can hang out up here
and my hair will just talk to you right
the hair is prepped and now gonna get
naked kiss this shit stains I don't want
to ruin my hoodie so instead we're going
to Harvard so I got four bottles of the
film two in each color
we got moon rock and meteor that gives
me no indication of what color these are
supposed to be infused with vitamin rich
blue sea kelp what seek help help help
me it's trying to tell me something flu
seek help extract and moonstone extract
like from the fucking moon with the
Freeman's a alright we got a double
angle okay here we go oh that feels
weird
Oh Oh it's tingling looks like cotton
candy sure you did
let's give myself a street guy guess
we look at you guys like my new hair
band wow it looks blue on my head why
it's pink on my hand
we're I'm no Silver Fox I'm a iridescent
Fox ah
the stuff is shimmery is like look at
that to me this definitely looks like an
iridescent nail powder like one of those
pink to blue unicorn ones I gotta admit
it's it's so pretty weak that is not a
satisfying foam dollar how about this
yeah and check out that technique boy
I'm having the time of my life it's time
to weigh in I would like your thoughts
I'm kind of digging this streaks look if
it weren't for the texture I think I'd
really dig this look but it feels so
crusty and hard anyone who is over 20
years old may remember back in the day
when we used to have hair mousse that
would go like this so we would do a lot
more than that and when your hair was
wet you would scrunch it up like this
and then you would end up with a bunch
of crusty curls all over your head and
this was in style oh my god this would
make a beautiful highlight just imagine
just picture this
all right let me wash my hands and we'll
try the second color wash it off pretty
easily so there's that
hello aren't you in there I think I got
it done no I give up let's try this on
ready that is violent so it's pretty
similar to the other color I guess
you're going to see more of a difference
on the blonde haired beauty so let's
never get to have the fun now what if we
mix them what if I just go like this oh
it's so cold I'm going for a slicked
back alien look I really hope this comes
out now the instructions did say comb
through to soften but it honestly feels
so hard like if I just comb through this
my hair might just break apart the comb
doesn't go any further it's the air 2068
what's in your hair
don't mind me I'm just having the time
of my life got boring brown hair it's
not a problem anymore if you like my
scalp is stinging that's not a good
thing I don't think we already know I'm
allergic to fake hollow why is it just
leaking out water like what the fuck
I literally hear crackling in my hair
I feel like my hair is gonna break oh my
god no I spent 29 years growing this
look at this well no shit
don't following my sweat pants look I've
got little craters on my desk little
colonies are forming look how beautiful
I am I'm so beautiful I was nominated
for another beauty award at the shorties
because because I'm short I guess oh
this is kind of cute this is like a
beautiful prom updo we're gonna need a
little bit more on top now this is
beautiful but it could use just a little
something to the perfect accessory a
beautiful actually holographic hair clip
Oh perfect
I could put a second one in too but that
might be overkill okay yeah let's give
it just one all right let me flip around
show you the back so you can see the
full efforts of the simply salon
when I wear this look every day probably
not I imagine this would be a lot of fun
if you're at like this slumber party
sleepover and you're 12 or if you're
like me and you're almost 30 years old
and you just want to have some fun on
top of your head died my nails what's on
my hand is big hollow hair phone I got a
question for you what do you think what
do you think was good to hear actually I
did this myself finally did something if
you want to feel it smells in here
will you come pet my head please I
really it feels like my hair is gonna
break couldn't you like style I did it
looks beautiful I'm going to Prague why
don't you go to a hairdressers are whoa
