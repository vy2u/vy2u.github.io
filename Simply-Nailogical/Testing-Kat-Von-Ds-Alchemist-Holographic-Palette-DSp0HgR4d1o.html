hello everyone it's me Christine again
now I know you guys have watched my life
update my dragon hata model a log of it
I've done it I was a child actress I can
excel she is so because it hurts my
heart to do my nails right now we gonna
do a makeup that's right I'm gonna be
your next favorite beauty guru just call
me since we faced logical look at all my
brushes
look I'm expanding my network of brushes
and today we're going to use the Kat Von
D Alchemist Pallas holographic palettes
through intense attention in the air
guys tweet this to me like every Sunday
first impression it is a triangle
Illuminati confirmed
it has an A on it Illuminati confirmed
that that was those terrible joke
Christie knows I was disgusting the box
is definitely Hollow see that shifting
rainbows magical kissing rainbows Hollow
so I already swatched these on snapchat
that's why they're not perfect flippin
and we got four little I shot Sasha face
and eye highlighters that I would define
as non holographic I think these are
technically duochrome shadows or
iridescent shadows because they do have
some color shifting elements to them
they are not a rainbow prism spectra my
goodness stop pretending to be what
you're not makeup company Wow that's
kind of hurt just because they're not
holographic doesn't mean they're not
pretty though hey don't get me wrong
these are pretty since we're gonna do
our list we got to scrub them oh
that she's good holy are you stupid
I'm hungry I don't even need to
wash my face let's start with our eyes
first because I usually mess those up I
was applying some white now why
does it look like cloudy face paint this
is my new palette that I made myself
because they like stuck to Magnuson and
I don't know why I got one this time I'm
slowly becoming a professional bear with
me so I'm not a hundred percent sure
what we're going for here but
that's her ball swimming on a bland LAN
LAN tail someone takes my makeup away um
holy
oh my god snow I'm beautiful I kind of
like the unblended look I don't know any
clean brushes they're only brown with
something we mentioned putting colors on
your eyes all I know what should I start
with lips use the purpley Pinkie Pie Wow
mmm see it looks even cooler over than
purple oh playing that more towards
the outer edges and now just a quick
 just put that right into your
eyeball you're going to carry that just
a bit up here actually not just a bit
like the whole spoon
ten-yard there you go yes yes I don't
really know how to fun but hey don't
worry about my blending worry about your
blending okay now we wait all the
off our face feed good thing I didn't do
my face first
now I haven't used the green from this
palette I guess I thought the green
would be kind of weird with this look
because this look is just so normal you
know I got this tiny thing as a sample
from Sephora so we're gonna use it and
it's basically just to make your skin
glow oh yeah oh my god I love samples
beep oh I have this shape tape so you
take me seriously really fine that it is
like too much product so I just do a
little sauce everywhere cuz I don't want
to put that much concealer on because
then all my freckles home because it
disappears oh no and that's it I'm not
putting foundation on because
I don't know how simply the beauty tips
number 143 don't use foundation to that
 don't even bother
it's Bab on a little concealer just a
little to cover up like your pimples and
like whatever the you going on
your face then I got do is take some of
the powder sheet we can set it and pull
to get it like an infomercial I think
you only really need to put the powder
 on places where you put concealer
but I'm not really sure it made me go
watch someone else's video oh my god
what's the song every song time do
people not wear clothes when they're
doing their makeup how do you prevent
this do they were bid good thing I
wasn't wearing my Armani key Ponte
jacket so my nose is really been dry and
no matter what I do I always have dry
skin powder it windows now it's time to
contour I got this one it's new yes I
know this is a giant brush okay I'm
using it because Nicki told you just
brush your hair into the look better
always commenting on how my contour
blended with well I got a message
for you I know
so this contour palette is also Kat Von
D now along with mass clown series I
don't have any tattoos I'm not sure if
she would talk to my kind of people but
the contour in your hair
now I'm going to go in with this light
color because my concealer dried kind of
dark now it looks like I said contour
there but I did oh yeah oh we're
supposed to do this we got to cut the
cheekbones we got to cut them are you
just supposed to put the light color
like all of your face because that's
that's what I'm doing you so much for
not using foundation my house what else
blush I'm using a this one that I broke
like three years ago
the only time the beauty butter smiles
but I like to just take a q-tip stick it
in my mouth and then get all the powdery
 out of my eye bruh I'm using a dip
brow pomade in a medium bra
just color them and like color in the
lines just don't forget to stay in the
line most beauty bloggers will tell you
that it's that simple but we all know
it's not and here's the thing okay when
you first dip your brush in the eyebrows
 you go to put on your face it's
like what's the fall you don't want that
on your eyes no so and that's what they
don't tell you is that they're probably
like doing this and then they go like
this ah see that's how they get that
soft lundi mist into their eye so it
doesn't look like they Fontaine's a
month simply due to tip number 227
you're welcome like I don't know this to
be true I just think that's what to do
so now going to put on some lashes
because I will be just it's like
sometimes I feel like putting on lashes
completely ruined my eye shadow so that
happens remember that I did this here
goes absolutely nothing I can't be I'm
even here I'm a little bit a little bit
a little bit what the is that to
put on the second one I'm turning the
camera off to use but I am definitely
relieved they don't make fake lashes for
your bottom lashes it's gonna take this
guy right there
oh oh what a mess whoops well for me
baby
good now we're gonna take the paint put
that on top oh yeah buddy oh yeah
yeah I'm gonna put some lips on my face
one of the main reasons why I wanted to
play with this little guy because I saw
this look on Instagram by Miss Jasmine
ed I want to make out with you first
I'm going to use this Geoffrey start
white liquid lipstick and I'm going to
put the Kat Von D highlighter palette on
top I am backing away please do not
attack me holy shitballs I just like
really fun way
I forgot I can't talk drug lord egg
that's where I get my high note from I
kind of like this absolutely handy you
have you don't yell brush and then split
it and put it on your mouth so I think
you just tap it and they're working
something worked moyson going on try
using a singer that seems to always work
better kind of working but kind of not
what do you think what do you think what
do you think what do you think what do
you think really do you think you saying
what I've been thinking of wearing this
torque I'm under want a makeup that's
why they call me sugar lips oh did you
want any frosted covered donuts Oh too
late I ate them all okay I swear it and
