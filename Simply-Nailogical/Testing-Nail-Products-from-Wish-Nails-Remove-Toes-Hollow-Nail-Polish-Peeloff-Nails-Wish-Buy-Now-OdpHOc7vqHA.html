feels like it's gonna hurt I don't want
to do it I don't want to do it anymore I
go yeah you want to do this why well
hello everyone it's me Christine again
thank you say hi yeah feeling herself in
her bed what Oh teenagers I tell you
welcome back
so as you may have seen in my previous
video about buying things I wish I
bought a bunch of hollow things put them
all together and made a fabulous outfit
and by the end of the video I got a
little simply mom logical actually it
was both of your hollow parents and in
that lecture we talked about
globalization and the ethics of
consumption and I would like to thank
those of you who submitted an essay all
of you get an aid because you actually
did that if you haven't seen my first
wish video that I suggest that you go
watch that first because it is a
prerequisite for this video since we
already did the whole critical
sociological analysis of buying things
off wish I'm not gonna repeat it but I
just want to point out what some of you
were saying in the comments that it's
not just extremely low priced clothes or
products that can be made by workers in
possibly unfair conditions but that that
can also be the case for very expensive
brands as well you guys are using your
brain I like it anyways bitch don't like
your bed Oh Magi Magi Magi yeah and so
today my popular request we're gonna see
what kinds of nail products wish has
just browsing the wish website it looks
like they have a shitload and who better
to put them to the test
than I because I need more nail related
content on this channel let's see what
they got
it's okay mention don't get so excited
will they be any good well I wish that I
could return them or will they be good
garbage we will find out to force a code
Oh Chi anti Overflow glue pot
exclamation mark peel off liquid tape
latex
tape peel off base coat now
liquid palisade cloth deal the liquid
palisade is probably the trademark name
of an actual liquid latex product for
ass which just seems to have no problem
at all in misappropriating other
people's legal trademarks so I think
what I'm gonna do instead of trying them
all like one at a time
is we're gonna open everything and then
kind of figure out how we can make them
all work into one nail design what's
next what's next is this they're like
squishy squishy little stickers is this
for peel-off nails throw manicure tools
base coat fast peel-off sticker
protector for sheet color transparent
one dollar she doesn't steal or is it
what's this is it a glossy taco yes it
is so I think this was a multi-purpose
listing for a few things to help mask
the yellow color I'm not sure why it's a
top coat is marketed as masking yellow
nails that does really make any sense
the masking yellow nails usually goes
with a base coat but okay we got some
nail polish black starry sky holographic
eleven dollars for this this isn't even
like a regular sized nail polish
interesting interesting okay so I would
call this a multi chrome polish but then
there's also tiny little bits of hollow
glitters scattered throughout oh look at
all these new powders I've been like
kind of obsessed with nail powder lately
time to make me go to rehab but I said
no no hollow born pretty peacock
holographic chameleon nail powder mere
nail art chrome pigment glitters so
naturally the photo immediately made me
click buy what up heel off base coat
really that's been a while so I got you
a venti damn
t is so good today Neal off base coat
though it looks like this particular
peel-off base coat is not listed on the
wish website anymore I sure hope it's
not cuz it doesn't peel well what is
this a snail bib this must have come in
too late for when I was filming my last
video finally arrived to me four months
after I ordered it it's not the length
of my body it's now vinyl stickers one
sheet mermaid scaled triangle grid
pattern now vinyls easy use manicure
irregular hollow six dollars for only
one sheet I expected more for less from
you wish so wish carries a lot of
different nail vinyl styles and as I was
browsing them I noticed this those are
my nails believe it or not free excuse
me you can even see my watermark except
they inverted the image no I did not
give wish permission to use my photos
and if I had to guess I would say that
the majority of these nail bloggers
whose nails are in the photos also did
not give wish permission to use their
pictures most nail bloggers end up
putting watermarks on their photo for
this exact reason
not cool wish not cool ooh what's this
smear effect chrome metallic silver nail
art varnish polish and base book so
after I made that model's own liquid
chrome nelle polish video a lot of you
guys said how you saw what you thought
was the same stuff on wish who was
really the world's first liquid chrome
now polish ooh more chrome polish
according to the picture with the
watermark
I think this is the same one that's sold
on the born pretty store one of these is
the chrome polish and one of them is the
topcoat oh we got some brushes and some
dotting tools and only seven dollars
that's that's pretty good is this I
don't remember ordering green nail
polish why would I order that it's so
boring when I look up my order history
it leads me to this
what new color club magic attraction
holographic hollow glitter nail polish
cause MEK tick nail care obviously I
wanted the green hollow that was
pictured in the item description and
also this is not color club which is a
pretty well-known nail polish brand in
there Tracy using that name and they're
listening every listing which angers me
just a little bit more oh what's this we
got some heroin healthy polish wow it
looks like it's gonna be real Hollow
mom's happy today
shiny rainbow laser magic holographic
nail polish though it looks like this is
not fake news good job Wesch nail guard
glue to sheet 40 tips nail art guard
glue peel off sticker you I think this
is supposed to be similar to something
we already opened which is a sticker
that you put under your nail polish that
allows you to peel it off later but it's
a very different looking sticker so
we'll be able to evaluate which one is
better
okay who's ready to enter the torture
chamber first what the actual
professional ingrown toenail toe fix or
recover correction device protector tool
pedicure foot nail care it's supposed to
extract your toenail Oh
also looks like a wine bottle opener or
just like a little robot man oh look we
got some more nail vinyls nail art
hollow sticker um and they're black this
up pirate we've got some nail polish
it's actually hollow Wow shoot that's
pretty mourn pretty high ingredients
holographic nail art varnish polish
shining in the dark well that's one way
to describe holla
okay that's everything alright let's do
our nails first we're gonna have to peel
off these beautiful beautiful nails but
at least you're gonna get some peel
so I think before we start doing the
nail art fun stuff let's first test off
these peel-off stickers feel that stick
it on a nail that fits the same size
okay let's try sticking on these ones
why are they so short this literally
makes no sense it's like half my nail I
got some gel polish and some gel taco
neither of them are from wish so we're
gonna need a gel something for testing
out these peel-off gel strips painting
it over top of the strip oh my god
Maggie who raised you I'm only gonna
paint just over top of them because
that's the only part we can feel man we
gotta bake that shit for a minute you
want to see what this shit looks like
it's an alien jelly portal now let's add
some glossy gel taco I did it again look
at that beautiful beautiful nails bye
Christine so I'm not gonna win a nail
painting a word with these but let's see
if it feels Wow oh shit wow that's that
turns me on
that's right it's not suitable for
children oh these feel really sticky
like ah feels like it hurts okay now
that that's out of the way let's do some
nail art first I'm really curious to try
out these a mere chrome polish so one of
them comes with the base coat you're
supposed to use for optimal results and
the other one comes with a top coat
you're supposed to use for optimal
results that literally smells like car
paint and I know what that smells like I
think we're gonna put this one on a nail
swatch tester
not really looking very liquid mere to
me no I want this on my nails oh this
one actually looks more promising whoa
holy shit I am amazed I am impressed I
am shocked that looks pretty good
okay we're off to a good start let's
just add the pilaf base coat to all of
our other nails ooh
hollow we're gonna need a couple coats
of this one still not sure why I got
this dark green creme nail-polish but
hey what do you know it's actually not
that bad that's just one coat shit okay
mmm this is a pretty pink holo now let's
try this silver one my dance this is my
dance okay this is a hollow taco cuz it
is so sheer we're gonna need the seven
coats of this oh my god what started
cracking up
I'm so confused why why if this were
croco nail polish then it's doing a
pretty shitty job of cracking up evenly
we're just having a scrap down my middle
finger nail alright now it's time to add
a wish glossy Tackett I gotta like fill
in the gaps
now that it's dried we can put on some
hollow nail vinyls we got to do this
fast and quick yeah oh shit it's lifting
it I guess we're gonna keep the sticker
on my nail that's an option too you
don't have to use it as a stencil you
just trim around your nails so you can
cut the excess right off now we got a
hollow multi-crew mermaid accent now I
guess they all accent mails good
whatever so after about a half an hour
now it should be completely dry oh
that's not
dry maybe we could do like a gradient
over top of the nail vinyls
let's try this liquid latex first so the
purpose of this is to protect your skin
from nail polish when you're dabbing on
different colors but oh my god did you
notice what's on my other hand it's a
beautiful bright aqua blue metallic
polish with hollow glitters in it and
it's not from wish now we're gonna get a
makeup sponge now I didn't order these
off wish but most people have these in
their home somewhere how do you think I
do my makeup I really don't have the
best color selection of polishes from
wish but we're gonna work with what we
have oh yeah yeah I don't know how this
weird green crackly polish is gonna
behave but I'm excited to find out then
you're just gonna dab dab dab make your
nails look fab the green doesn't really
want to dab does it so we're just gonna
cheat a little bit don't tell anyone
all right we're ready for the peel
everyone hold your breath the kind of
has a pattern Wow and now let's play
with the powder there's not very much in
here though I got played yo I'm gonna
send my people after them because I need
the full cut that I paid for
I mean it's not as hollow as I would
have poked her as the pictures show nail
art brushes and dotting tools there's
actually a pretty good variety of
different types of brushes in here how
about let's son don't be scared now free
hand I have an idea
what if we paint something with the
chrome polish should I try and write
wish Ricci follow bless all right not
bad and these are just dotting tools let
me demonstrate you just kind of add some
little dots easy peasy we got to finish
by adding a nice thick coat of glossy
tack go there's not really a design or a
color story going on here but whatever
overall I think I got a combination of
hit and miss I still don't know what the
fuck this green polish is and this one
really surprised me
I don't regret buying all these powders
I mean I have eight others that are very
similar to this one but you know what
there's more than one item I ordered
from wish that I could have got directly
from born pretty store and I kind of get
the feeling based on the images and
listening descriptions that maybe they
have the same supplier or
conspiracy-theory
they're run by the same people
it's kind of disproportionate how many
nail items that are specifically born
pretty store items are on wish like why
the only thing less if we got a test out
is this contraction and I am terrified
of putting this on my body so and bad
pain I have a gift for you
nope so we all know Ben's been a great
sport on my channel you've been so good
then okay and so for that I want to give
you a little gift
oh I'm gonna need your toe like a
torture device Clockwork Orange it's
time to perform suit you easy you trust
me really
what oh my god I'm holding on you have
to tighten the knob oh my god I'm sorry
I don't want to do this yeah you
twisting I'll tell you in this dub this
is like for someone who has a foot
fetish and a bondage fetish isn't that
fun don't come in here again you don't
want to keep your gift thanks man for
always being a good sport Oh Mitchy is
it your turn shit and now it's time for
some more appeal porn oh she's still a
little sticky okay I think I'm done with
this wish investigation thing you've
checked out some clothes and now we've
done nail stuff and I don't think I'm
curious anymore curiosity has killed the
cat but not mushy don't you dare touch
her I personally will not be shopping at
wish in the future but I am NOT your
mother
all the police so you may do whatever
you choose to do and whatever you are
comfortable with hey Jay when she comes
back with me all right mentor you gonna
stay with me thanks so much for watching
