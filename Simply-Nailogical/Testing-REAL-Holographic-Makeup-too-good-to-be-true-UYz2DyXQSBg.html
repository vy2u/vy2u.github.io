hello everyone it's me Christine again
today simply face logical and today
we're gonna do the same old song and
dance and ask important life questions
such as is this thing real I am a living
meme now we all know that every makeup
company and their sister company is
coming out with holographic makeup we've
seen Kat Von D cover FX milk makeup
Sephora brand Kylie Jenner and now even
do your makeup think it's their Hollow
sexual except none of this is real
Hollow
it's iridescent or duochrome at best
because it doesn't have all the shifting
rainbows that it needs to have to be
real Hollow we're all getting tired of
explaining ourselves I am tired of
myself but maybe there's a reason why we
haven't seen real Hollow and makeup yet
because if it were possible wouldn't one
of these major cosmetics companies
already have figured it out and cashed
in on that by now it's the simple
questions in life I need answers for
anyway it's what we're here to do today
is to test out something new something
that may potentially be actual
holographic makeup these are liquid
hollow unicorn shadows that just came
out on the market this is the box and
this is the component you see me simply
face logical it's learning her lingo
they are made by super chic lacquer
which yes is an indie nail polish
company whom I know very well because I
have many of their holographic polishes
behind me I am also an affiliate with
super chic lacquer which means that when
you guys click my links or use my code
there I get a small commission from that
sale if you choose to purchase I just to
be clear I am NOT sponsored to make this
video no one is making me make this
video other than myself which means I
can say whatever the fuck
simply phase logical takes her reviews
very seriously
these unicorn shadows are the first
cosmetics product that super chic
lacquer has
were put out to my knowledge and they
launched with 17 different shades of
this liquid hollow stuff is it true is
there finally real hollow makeup
a prince of one's life Pablo I finally
found you take a breath
let's dive right in first of all I can
tell you that right off the bat just by
looking at them in the bottle they are
in fact real Hollow so check honestly
they all look sexy as in fact they look
so Hollow and so good that they look
like nail polish one of these swatches
is the unicorn shadows makeup and the
other is a silver linear hollow polish
can you tell which one is which on that
note let's segue into the ingredients
evidently if you did not know this I am
NOT a professional chemist like most of
you just trying to figure out life using
Google I'm not gonna go through all the
ingredients but I'll just do the few
that might be questioned get ready for a
Christine the unqualified science Queen
ingredients witch hazel but does it
water Myrtle alcohol Dean Act which
means denatured alcohol I'm not a great
gift okay I'm gonna be serious I promise
let me just check my notes yes I took
notes I did homework can be used in
cosmetics as a preservative to suppress
foaming of the formula and to help thin
it out but also a bunch of other shit on
him got some purified water is it Fiji
propylene glycol ISO dodecane Holly
isobutene glycerine glycerine
don't let the follow by
PvP which stands for poly vinyl pirate
look it is a polymer which essentially
means plastic scientists will sound off
in the comments below and we got sugar
this is edible no no it's not edible and
then we got aluminum powder cake but I
just want to know where does the hollow
come from okay but on a serious note
while aluminum powder is approved for
use in face and eye cosmetics by the FDA
there is some evidence to suggest that
exposure to aluminum powder may be
linked to health issues that being said
it is an ingredient used by some popular
eyeshadow brands so maybe it is more of
a question of dosage quality or form the
aluminum powder comes in that changes
the risk I don't know to what extent
these were regulated in the super chic
formula and to be honest there are mixed
messages on the internet about this
which make me feel like I'm not
comfortable making any concrete
conclusions about the safety of this
makeup is this safe to put on your face
because it looks like nail polish
granted it doesn't feel like nail polish
at all it's actually quite liquidy and
watery it doesn't smell like the way
nail polish smells but it definitely
doesn't smell good either mostly just
sounds like alcohol now the box does say
to keep away from mucous membranes which
includes your eyeball but there is
something else to consider if you are
someone who has an allergy or
sensitivity to metals in makeup as I do
this has aluminum powder so there is
metal in it that was easy but what I
would recommend and what you know a lot
of companies recommend we do but we just
never do is to do a swatch test or a
patch test somewhere inconspicuous like
your neck before you go ahead and just
run this all over your face it might not
be a bad idea to actually do that patch
test and that's what I did about a week
ago I put two of the shave on my upper
neck just below my chin I left them on
for about four hours to see if I had any
kind of immediate reaction after I wiped
them off I did not see any redness or
signs of irritation and 24 hours and 48
hours later same thing my skin looked
normal for me personally it was more
important to do a patch test first
because I've had some allergy
issues with metals why do you hate me
metals what did I do to you I love metal
some of you may remember that in the
summer I had some allergic reaction to
fake hollow mica
what do you know I went to the
dermatologist and we determined that I
was actually allergic to a few different
types of metals that are commonly used
in makeup products this is what happens
when you get old I wasn't allergic to
metal like two years ago aluminum is
actually not one of the types of metals
that I was tested as allergic to but
they're all kind of related said my
dermatologist so I wanted to be careful
this as much as I love hollow I don't
want to fuck up my face after my
research and my swatch tests and knowing
my skin allergens I decided it was safe
enough for me to proceed with the
purposes of making this video haven't
started no it will cause too much thank
you drink slave so first I did a bunch
of arm swatches and you're probably
wondering how did you create such
beautiful straight lines Kristine you're
not that good of an artist I used nail
vinyls
well technically not nail vinyls but
they are nail vinyls for your face
there's some swatches on Instagram who
do this kind of thing but I'm not sure
where they get their stencils but I
found a bunch and I put a link to where
you can find these down below
first I swatch six of the silver looking
shades three of them have an added
iridescent shimmer to them so we've got
pink blue and kind of a yellowy color
then we got the classic hollow silver
that one's called antidote we've got the
hollow flaky so beautiful and we've got
another silver one that kind of looks
duller than the others there's an iPhone
photo with flash and without flash you
only really see the color pop and the
iridescent ones if you're looking at it
from a certain angle but they all
definitely have holo in them I would
have to say my favorite from this bunch
is the classic silver hollow one and the
hollow flaky one because I love me some
chunky hollow then i swatched five of
the colored hollows the black hollow one
is basically my sole I also really like
this coppery British one yeah and
there's even more that I didn't swatch
because famous watcher is exhausting
hats off to you Instagram ladies they
also all wiped off really easily
in fact too easily because all it took
was just wiping my fingers over it and
it started to kind of pill up if that
makes sense like like pilling like in
clothes so that gives you an idea of
wearability you probably won't last that
long
shut up Christine put this shit on your
face okay yes I'm ready in true beauty
guru style I spent half the video
talking about shit before I put that
shit on my face the instructions say
shake well before and during use only
people who like my dad will get this
reference why should I put it first how
about a hollow highlight tried to DIY
one myself ones that didn't really work
out it was just really oily Oh
Golden's chewy now one thing I did
notice when I was putting this on my
arms is that you can't really blend this
but let's try again on my face try and
buff it out just a little it kind of
just makes it look more silver and less
Hollow if that makes sense doesn't
exactly blend it's important to note
that the current lighting setup I have
which has been calibrated for a
beautiful person and training is not
ideal for showing the rainbow properties
of holo because for that you really need
all these diffused lights to be gone and
you just need an iPhone flash really
well hello always put more oh shit okay
that's interesting I think my eye is
noticing that there's alcohol on my face
because this eye feels slightly
irritated maybe it's from the fumes from
being close to my eye but not in my eyes
instructions say it may be rubbed over
top gently while semi dry to create
vibrant smooth hollow chrome effects
little buffing like nail buffing like
with nail powder oh shit I think that's
actually working on my god shit it's
actually like buffing in the nail powder
more I do this the more like linear
hollow it looks
Wow and now I want to track the hollow
flaky one this one maybe you need to
like dab a bit more wait wait I wonder
if we can dab dab dab to make your face
fab I've been doing this we get rid of
snow on the liquid part and we get the
extra auto flakes
yes maximum flake your 5mm
makeup Russia doesn't really work to
blend this stuff weird it's like it only
responds to your finger the hollow only
reacts to the human touch wow I feel
like I could go to Coachella and I would
probably hate it which side do you guys
like better personally I like the
chunkier hollow flaky one because it
just stands out and screams at you from
a distance but I can still appreciate
the linear hollow one alright now we
have to try a color now I'm not gonna
use these as eyeshadows because I don't
want to get too close to my eyeball but
we can try and use just a little bit as
a brow bone highlight how about that I'm
gonna take this pinky rose gold one kind
of wipe off enough because I don't want
it to drip and carefully put it right
here
just a little okay that doesn't really
look like much what let's try another
one that one has more of a hollow kick
to it and slowly she became the tenth
woman since these aren't really that
ideal for blending what we could do is
some stenciling so you could use nail
vinyls faiths finals
whatever vinyl where do I put him he's
big how about right here hot new trend
unicorn contour now we're gonna peel to
reveal that's cool I'm 12 ABBA let's do
one on our forehead
just looks like someone threw a rock at
my head and it got stuck let's do a
sailor thing ahoy captain simply
analogical channel I've gone off the
deep end okay what else can we do to my
face this is turned into a challenge how
many shapes can I put on my face what if
we trace the hollow there now it looks
like I intentionally put shapes on their
face I'm not tracing the unicorn okay
we're done tracing we're not gonna put
this on our lips but I will make history
today and actually put some lipstick on
I just never wear lipstick I don't know
I just feel like it's not necessary when
you have no lips I just thought it was
exempt from having to wear lipstick oh
that's right I was that so bright on my
lips but like really dark in the tube
what games you playing Bobby Brown now
it's time for a mandatory narcissistic
montage
okay so what do you think what do you
think maybe this is the reason why we
haven't seen major cosmetics company has
come out with real hollow makeup it's
kind of tricky to apply you can't really
blend it and it only looks cool in the
perfect lighting although that's
something we're all used to being
homosexuals on this channel this
probably isn't something you could wear
every day and maybe not even really to a
festival if it's just gonna wipe off
that's just water but it would be great
for an Instagram picture I'm gonna wash
this off and let you guys know how my
face handled this experience I feel like
I've been complaining for a year about
how there's no real hollow makeup now
it's here
and now I don't know what to do with it
I can't wear this to work and be taken
seriously would you put this hollow
makeup on your face and how would you
put it on your face or should Hollow
just be reserved for nails do you have
any conspiracy theories about hollow
make a comment down below and say hallo
and that was another video brought to
you by simply face logic I know you guys
have missed my makeup tutorials it's
been a few months and what has the world
done without them I don't know I had to
put simply face logical on the bench
because I was dealing with the allergy
trying to figure that out and now we got
it under control and as long as this
didn't fuck up my face I'm good I want
to go back home and journey to be a
beautiful birthing funny coz a year and
a half ago I broke my nail and then I
couldn't really do nail art videos then
I got into whatever kind of videos
including makeup and then I had an
allergic reaction and I couldn't do
makeup videos the universe just doesn't
want me to make videos
subscribe to prove the universe wrong
alright everybody thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
