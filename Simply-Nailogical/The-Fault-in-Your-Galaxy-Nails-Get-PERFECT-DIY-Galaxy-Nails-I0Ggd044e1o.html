wonder if we're just two tiny specks in
someone else's galaxy nails no whoa
well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again now where is my prize for best
corny intro to a run-of-the-mill nothing
special nail art tutorial where is it
where is it today we're gonna be doing
galaxy nails whoop whoop yay so original
but first were you jealous of my
holographic shirt
they started shipping out already so if
you already got one you should be
receiving them this week depending on
where you live and I have some great
news for those hallo sexuals who are
never on time we are going to extend the
campaign for five more days so that
means you have until this Friday to grab
your hallo swag and then they will
actually be over yes they are limited
edition because the holo is so rare and
so special you can grab yourself a shirt
before they're gone at the link below in
the video description box and when you
get your shirts don't forget to use the
hashtag simply swag on social media so I
can see all of your pretty faces okay to
infinity and beyond first I'm going to
start off with a peel off base coat
because I am a peel porn savage Savage
then I'm gonna start off with a coat of
this holographic dual chrome shimmery oh
my god what it has my name on it oh my
god what there are too many
announcements in this video let me
introduce you to my picture polish
collaboration shade hollow sphere I made
it because it's like a galaxy in a
bottle well I didn't make it but I told
them what to put in it so you could just
put this on your nails and it's like a
galaxy and you don't got to do any more
work there you go you're welcome
hollow sphere is a black jelly base with
silver hollow glitters scattered hollow
and some purple to blue color shifting
shimmers there's like so much
packed in the bottle I was like give me
all the put it all in the same
bottle perfect okay now let's put it on
my nails this is one coat oh and I
already it up because it's a
jelly polish it'll take two to three
coats to reach full opacity or you could
just put it over black or a dark color
if you want and now let's add a quick
dry glossy taco because I had to take
some pictures of just the Polish oh and
yes if you're new here I'm saying taco
on purpose I know that it's top coat I
just like saying taco okay I'm hungry
give me a break all right let's make
some galaxy nails I was inspired by this
duct tape the only thing it was missing
was hollow but it was pretty cool duct
tape other than that first you're gonna
take a makeup sponge then you're gonna
destroy it huh yes revenge
hey all you need is a teeny tiny piece
that you're gonna hold with some
tweezers then you're gonna apply some
liquid latex around your nail so you
don't get all over your skin it's
really that simple wait a second
no it's not the Illuminati it's just
what's on my other hand it's a beautiful
teal linear holo that I've been wearing
for 1314
I don't know a float of days and if you
guys follow me on snapchat and you've
been watching my other hand closely
waiting for it to chip but it won't
because I made this video and I know how
not to make a chip huh knock on wood
back to the future I mean the galaxy
you could wet your little spongy thing
you just a little then you're going to
take some acrylic paint start off with
white put it on yogurt lid or a nail art
matter your parents desk I don't care
then you're gonna dab dab dab it just to
get a tiny little bit of paint and then
you're gonna dab dab dab that on the
nail and and why does that look like
milk and oil something weird has
happened why did I even mix water with
this I don't know but you know what
that's the beauty of a galaxy nail
because galaxy nail art is supposed to
be messy and asymmetrical pretty sure I
said the exact same thing in my other
galaxy nail art video can pretty much
just put a clusterfuck of colors
anywhere you want in whatever pattern
then we're gonna add some blue because
galaxies are sad
just kidding they're not sad if they
have hollow in them basically all you
got to do is build this up but make the
little trails of the nebula smaller as
you go now let's add some purple to make
it more colorful and fun beautiful it's
beautiful and now since I covered up
most of the hollow sphere with the
galaxy I'm gonna put some hollows
for your back on yeh for making sense
like I said with this galaxy technique
you can pretty much go back and forth
change your mind at different colors
mute those colors undo redo whatever you
want now let's add some red to the
galaxy now keep in mind that your galaxy
is gonna look really matte and kind of
ugly as it is because we used acrylic
paint but the second you add a glossy
anything on top of it it's gonna go to a
whole nother dimension no pun intended
so once you're mostly happy with your
galaxy nail you're gonna peel off simply
peel ad no big deal that was like it was
almost unnecessary now we're gonna add a
holo taco because that is the key to
unlock any galaxy see what I mean the
second you put something glossy over it
it takes it to another dimension
alright now let's add some stars and god
I hate freehand the most annoying part
about doing freehand on camera is that
I'm doing it on camera I swear to you it
is ten times harder to paint a tiny tiny
line when the camera is watching me but
also just because the angle required to
film it the good thing about acrylic
paint on top of a taco means you can
just flick it right off and he's a q-tip
please and so I redid these off-camera
so you'll never know if I did them or I
hired a tiny elf to do it for me now
we're gonna add some more dots like
stars cuz I'm not drawing any more stars
add a final glossy taco to seal
everything in and bam your nails are out
of this world out of this hollow sphere
yes
great tagline Christine could chop
alright and that's that you got some
cool galaxy nails on your hand pretty
much the secret to any great galaxy from
now on is using my hollow sphere polish
underneath obviously just kidding it's
pretty much trial and error whole sleep
trials and a lot of errors don't forget
to leave me a comment down below if
you're gonna grab hollow sphere or one
of my hollow shirts I want to know all
about it
I want to know what you got and what are
you gonna do with it well it should be
pretty obvious what you're gonna do with
it wear it um yeah so thanks so much for
watching this video and I'll see y'all
