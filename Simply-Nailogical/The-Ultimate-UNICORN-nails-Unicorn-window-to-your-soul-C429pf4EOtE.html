happy to finally tell you that I have
successfully summoned the unicorn the
unicorns were coming and then they came
all over my nails Christine you're so
inappropriate sometimes okay so I'm
fully aware that these nails aren't
really sitting on my nails properly I
tried to get it to work so it fit on my
nails so it would look like a normal
nail art manicure but I guess there was
a fatal flaw and the unicorn body parts
that I decided to use you'll see you
soon if you stay please stay please also
subscribe thank you
so first type it on a normal base coat
because I was afraid of peeling whatever
I was gonna do off with the peel off
base coat I know what a rare moment in
history hello it's me so this is
probably my favorite silver hollow
glitter it is amazing and there are so
many rainbows and what do we do with
rainbows will you put them on our nails
I just apply one coat first on my nail
and then I take a makeup sponge not to
put on makeup but to put it on my nail
because the sponge helps absorb excess
jellies leaving more glitters behind I
don't need to do my whole nail here I
really just need to focus on covering
the middle center of the nail because
that's where the little unicorn head
window is going to be eat now to
successfully summon the unicorn you're
going to need to use their body parts
this is unicorn skin it's also referred
to as iridescent cellophane in the art
industrial complex just cut some pieces
of skin off to fit your nail I like to
use tiny little russian scissors to make
the job a bit easier and put it on your
nail to see if it kind of fits your now
hopefully it does or else go back and
cut some more and then to adhere the
unicorn skin onto your nail you simply
take a clear nail polish or a topcoat
cover your whole nail in it and then
gently stick on the skins ooh my
what's that hollow blue polish on my
other hand it's a stunning blue stunner
that was found at the bottom of the
ocean that's right this polish is
actually called the heart of the ocean
Jack no please please hand me the hallo
polish before you die drown in the ocean
okay this is the key part of this nail
art that made it really challenging for
it to apply smooth on my nail and it's
because my nails are so freakin curved
like they are more curved than the
wheels on my car I literally tried
everything I tried putting the unicorn
skin in the microwave the key that would
soften the skin so it could be more
pliable and easier to put on my nail
that didn't work I did the best I could
at smoothing it down and then I glopped
on a super thick coat of topcoat
tacos here get your tacos here tacos for
everybody I fucked around with the
little fringes sticking out of the side
a little more after the topcoat and well
that's the best I could do so I'm done
but look I have unlocked the glory and
light and heaven of the unicorns are you
seeing what I'm seeing
like do you see those magical shifts
from pink to green to yellow what what
what mints load heavens magic why do I
gotta sound like a monkey why do I got
to do that next in order to truly honor
the unicorn we must use their heads
find your own unicorn head vinyls at the
link below in the video description box
take that beheaded corn and place it on
your nail right in the center smooth it
down a bit but at first I did try to
check if it would actually peel up
because if it peeled up the whole
unicorn skin that everything would be
ruined but I think it's gonna work so
let's move on next we're going to take
some simply peel because did you know
that simply peel is a far distant
relative of the unicorn it's true guys
look closely you can see the dandruff
glitters right in there next we're going
to take some proper Percy bitch pastel
colors and
sponge them randomly on a makeup sponge
and just sponge it right on top of that
unicorn head but do it gently be careful
don't harm the unicorn no unicorn shall
be harmed in the making of this video do
it again because these pastels have very
little color dab dab dab we're in the
unicorn lab that's some cotton candy
happiness and shit colors right there
and then I'm gonna take some tiny tiny
tweezers preferably tiny Russian
tweezers and carefully go in and extract
the unicorn head from your nail make
sure to peel it up in the correct
direction that's the one I just did in
front of you and then it's time to peel
off simply peel like no big deal yeah
unicorns yeah unicorn cheer except that
didn't really work out too well did it
the issue obviously again is that the
edge of the unicorn skin is sticking out
just a little and to truly summon the
unicorn we must speak their language by
using this nail polish because it
literally says the unicorns are coming
therefore they will come because keep
your polish let's also look at these
color shifting translucent pieces of
unicorns Andra these are epic I love
them I'm just gonna dab on a gentle
helping of these unicorn dandruff flakes
to help make the unicorn head feel more
at home on my nail in attempt to make my
nail appear smoother like actual nail
polish not like a Frankenstein project
I'm applying another super thick coat of
glossy top coat and sealing all around
the sides of my nails and the edges fYI
for people who might ask before I cut
the whole skin to fit my nail I did try
cutting the skin smaller than my nail
and kind of just trying to fit the head
of the unicorn shape but that was even
worse because look at this so for me the
only way to do itbest without it looking
completely terrible like it doesn't
belong in your nail was to cut the
unicorn skin to approximately fit the
shape of my nail I'm pretty confident
that this technique would work a lot
better on someone who has flatter and
less curved nails so if that's you and
you can pet unicorn skin out to fit your
nail perfectly then definitely go for it
and I want to hear all about it well I
don't want to hear about it I want to
see all about it there's got to be
someone out there who can do this better
than I
so it doesn't look like such a shitty
hack job but hack job aside you got to
admit these are pretty freakin cool you
know how they say that if you look deep
into someone's eyes you can see their
soul well for me I just look through
this unicorn window and I see my soul
you have to look through the unicorn
communications portal there is no
turning back you have been blessed by a
unicorn for life all right guys that's
it for today peace love and harmony to
all don't forget to keep calm and be a
unicorn thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
