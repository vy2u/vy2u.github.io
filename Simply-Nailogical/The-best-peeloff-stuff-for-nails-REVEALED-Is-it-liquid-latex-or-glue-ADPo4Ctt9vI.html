going to review six different products
used for easy post messy nail art
cleanup to help answer your burning
questions which peel off product should
you buy or should you even buy one at
all
this is the ultimate peel off faceoff
let the games begin
I'm gonna do the exact same basic
gradient nail art with all six of these
products to level out the playing field
and you'll get to see exactly how all
six measure up remember how we used to
or maybe you still do rely on the
acetone and angled eyeliner brush method
to clean up the edges of your nails
there's a much better solution out there
so you don't have to worry about the
stupid mess caused by gradients stamping
or water marbles please don't ask me to
make a water marble tutorial I'm not
going to do it
I'll be making just a simple gradient
today using the new pop-tastic pastel
neon collection by color club I couldn't
decide which few colors to use for nail
so I use them all on multiple nails
let's start with simply peel by bliss
kiss those are the same people who make
liscus nail oil go figure so it's 12
dollars a bottle for 15 milliliters not
intended for internal consumption
I was planning on eating it it's a basic
latex product creamy and it's got a lot
of glitter it has a pretty wide brush so
I have just a little bit of trouble
getting it right in there
but in my experience easy meets products
you really want to fill in as much of
the cuticle as you can because that way
you won't end up having to use that
stupid angled eyeliner brush with
acetone when you're not so drying time
says that it takes one-and-a-half to two
minutes
but oh my god it's sparkling look look
at the glitters they sparkle when it's
dry
oh my god I'm so distracted I can't
continue with this tutorial there's Oh
Freddie oh yeah I learned what not to do
can you get distracted by the glitter
I stuck my hands together and then the
latex sticks together so don't do that
but if you do that just take pair of
scissors and cut it apart and don't do
it again like I said I'm using the
pop-tastic passed it on the neon
collection by color clip just put it on
my little sponge it's a regular latex
free cosmetic foundation sponge from my
local grocery store actually that you
can find these kinds of sponges anywhere
that sells makeup it's right about here
that I started to realize this is
probably a terrible choice of polishes
to do for gradient tutorial one because
they're really light and two because I
literally needed four or five coats to
build them up to opacity so side note
this collection is not really that
efficient for gradients so just take a
q-tip and pull out the edge there if you
just hook it under somehow and then peel
it around comes off in one big swipe and
that's what we want to see folks that's
exactly what we want to see look at that
beauty goodness it's still glittering
just factly there's so many speckles oh
yeah back to what we're doing okay yeah
so looks like it works pretty well
and I don't see anything left on mine a
little so that's awesome so let me just
explain my scoring system to you I went
with a scale of one to six one being the
worst and six being the best but instead
of just arbitrarily giving each product
to score on its own like what would
happen if I give everyone at six
than who wins I decided to rank them all
after I use them and scored them
relative to each other to force a
ranking between them kind of like how
they do it on for weddings the TV show
on TLC their slice I can't remember ever
seen that no okay I evaluated each
peel-off product on four different
performance indicators cost application
drying time and effectiveness as in how
well it peeled off the messy stuff
our first pilaf Playa just step up to
the plate with simply peel she scored a
3 out of a possible 6 for cost
remember that's 1199 for 15 milliliters
a 5 out of a possible 6 per application
she went on so creamy and she littered
to board of a possible six for drying
time and six out of a possible six for
effectiveness that's right folks simply
peel was my absolute favorite in terms
of actually peeling off and that's
because she came off real thick which is
what we want because we don't want to
leave any stragglers
we don't wanna a little danglers nope
not me obviously you think next up we
have the well known liquid palisade by
PS so it's 10 grams which that's the
same thing as 10 milliliters I don't
know I think so
anyways $22 watt just got this purple
shimmer to her and she's got a really
small flexible brush but it's still
thick enough that it doesn't quite end
too much you still want the brush to be
sturdy enough that you can get right in
there and the brush not fray all over
them right the only drawback with this
application is that it takes me a lot
longer to cover my entire finger so for
people doing water marbles this would
probably be more going so drying time
says two to three minutes and the actual
drawing time two and a half minutes
so I go in with my toothpick and we got
one nice peel
yeah feels good so there's a couple
little stragglers around the edges but
that's probably the result of me not
putting the liquid palisade far enough
on the sides of my fingers which I
blamed the brush for and the scoreboard
says cost at one because it's $22 yeah
that's the most expensive I've seen for
any of these products so if you're rich
definitely buy this and if you're a
tassel definitely buy this application I
gave it a 6 because I think this brush
is the best for getting it closest to
the nail and into the cuticle so you
don't get no gradient mess up in your
cuticles drying time was pretty good and
effectiveness was also pretty awesome
next up we've got the crystalline nail
veil by color for nails it's got eight
milliliters it's six bucks which is
pretty cheap so that's always good and
it's yellow that's happy Scott is super
long brush reminds me of a striping
brush in fact I'm pretty sure it's just
a striping brush so I'm trying to put it
on but as you see I'm kind of having
challenges with this really long
flexible brush it tends to bend a little
too easy it's not as stiff as the liquid
palisade brush for example so I ended up
just having to use the side of the brush
which means that I won't do as good of a
job at outlining my nail so the
directions say to let it dry for
approximately 1 minute
times 7
it took me seven and a half minutes to
wait for this happy yellow to turn dark
which kind of just reminds me of rotten
pee but anyways that was annoying to
wait seven and a half minutes cuz I got
better things to do like I got holo
glitter polishes waiting to be made into
a porno or something so it's looking
pretty good to peel off it's all coming
off and one piece which is exactly what
I like to see yeah tiny little chance of
strangler but we got her don't worry
looks pretty good there's a tiny piece
of the yellow stuff left on my finger
but I'm okay with that it's fine so I'm
gonna give this yellow son child a four
out of a possible six four costs because
she's pretty cheap but not quite the
cheapest stay tuned and another four for
application but she went on sick enough
but the brush was long and flexi and
annoying a three for drying time and
then she got a four for effectiveness so
this is basic liquid latex that I bought
off Amazon I've heard quite a few nail
artists doing this because it's a much
cheaper option because it's kind of like
buying in bulk and it's used for body
latex painting or something like that I
got it off Amazon for eight dollars ish
that's for thirty milliliters so a lot
cheaper if you do the math and then I
open the bottle and like it's not liquid
no this is not liquid latex hello it's
solid latex or marshmallows I don't know
what this is but it's it's not what I
thought it was so yeah I I don't think I
can use this I'm sorry guys so because I
can't use this
it's an automatic score of 1 across the
board for this stupid product that I
guess was all dried up I don't even know
that I'm too lazy to contact the company
because I got videos to make or
something next up is the DIY method so a
lot of people just call this peel-off a
scope it's basically just glue and water
and people will use it under glitter
nail polish took off glitter but I've
also seen people using it around their
nails to peel off whatever it is you're
peeling off your skin so I followed nail
decorous tutorial on how to make your
own peel off base coat basically is just
Elmer's school glue remember that from
school arts and crafts so you fill up
3/4 of an empty bottle that you cleaned
out with blue and then you fill up the
last quarter with water and no I don't
do heroin this is just a liquid
injection needle I got for my cat when
she was sick yeah I know it's a very sad
day for Benji so just fill it up with
water put the cap on and shake it shake
it shake it like a Polaroid picture
shake it okay so I'm putting it on and
it's really messy and it reminds me of
something I shouldn't say when 11 year
olds are listening so there is no
recommended drying time so I just kind
of waited and see how it went but it
took nine minutes after seven minutes or
so I checked it and it wasn't quite
ready so I poked at it at around nine
minutes and I think it's ready I mean
like I don't know like it dries super
clear so it's hard to tell so I start
peeling it off and yeah I'm nervous it's
super nervous
how is No yeah oh my god I'm having an
anxiety attack oh my god I'm gonna have
to use acetone and and brush I mean like
what a mess and for everyone who
comments it's just glue in water when
people are asking with the purple stuff
is you are wrong you are so wrong I mean
like is this what you want on your nails
is this what you want to clean up I
don't think so angle buddy got time for
this
and now we shall shame you Elmer's glue
per cost you to 6 because fine you're
the cheapest of them all whatever that
doesn't mean that you're the winner okay
for application you get a three because
you're messy is a drying time you get a
one because you took almost ten minutes
of my life and effectiveness you get a
three cuz you sir next up we've got mess
no more
it's nine dollars and ninety cents got
ten milliliters and it's got a cow on it
it's got an applicator brush that's kind
of like an eyeshadow brush so it's
spongy and it's pink which looks pretty
it's a pretty because it's a pain so I'm
putting it on and I'm noticing that it's
really thin like I don't even know if
I'm covering my skin or not am i
covering my skin I don't know and then
I'm putting it in the corners and
probably yeah definitely hitting my nail
I notice that I have all these little
pink fibers all over my skin and my nail
like the hell am i growing of pink
fungus I don't know anyways I'm still
not sure about this product that I put
on another poke because I don't even
know if it's done double up when you're
not sure it says it takes two minutes to
dry and it was actually dry in one
minute
who knew cows could be so fast this does
not look good
No okay yeah so this reminds me a lot of
feel off basecoat make it yourself fill
up a cold glue
except now I'm just mad that I had to
paint my Tim nail six times so I pull it
off and I've got a ton of crap around my
cuticle so I'm gonna need to whip out
that angled eyeliner brush it she's not
making a happy kitty I noticed that my
skin is kind of like pink yes I know I'm
really white and my skin is naturally
pinkish but I swear this product sort of
stained my skin so let's score the cow
I gave it a twofer cost because it was
actually the second most expensive when
you do the math per milliliter it got a
2/4 application which is the lowest of
all of them because I had to give a 1 to
the liquid latex that was not liquid got
a 6 for drying time which is the best
because it did dry the fastest and it
actually dried in half the time that the
instructions said it would dry so
there's that the job cow it gets a two
for effectiveness of removal which is
like worse than I gave the peel off base
coat because it left pink fibers on me
and I'm pretty sure my skin is pink
because I'm finally gonna put on top
coat and here's the finished product
don't mind this day and skin how do our
six
peel-off players measure up I promised
you a cost grid so you can see no matter
what the size of the product is how much
you're actually paying so liquid
palisade for example is two dollars and
20 cents per milliliter and as you go
down the list it gets cheaper per
milliliter
simply peel is the only one of these
products that come to the larger
full-sized option it's about four times
the size of the regular bottle at 60
milliliters and it costs $30 but that
works out to just under fifty cents a
milliliter which makes us the cheapest
peel off-- products actually designed
for nails the product with the highest
score which would mean the best score is
simply peel coming at 18
a humble second place is liquid palisade
with just one less point and I think if
liquid palisade was half the price then
it would probably be a clear winner but
got 22 dollars that's like not pocket
change and we've got to be yellow nail
Bale Singh and then the Elmer's glue and
then the PAL thing and then the liquid
latex which shouldn't even get 1/8 it
should get a zero because it was I hope
you guys have found this somewhat
helpful and informing your decision of
which peel-off product you should buy if
any and my overall conclusion would be
that yes you should buy one because peel
off face DIY glue sucks
links to all the products and where to
buy them are in the youtube description
box below and leave me a comment and let
me know your thoughts and maybe I'm the
only one who has a pink cow stain on her
finger I'm not sure thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
