robot but it's down on this new
innovative sophisticated piece of nails
technology the heat air airbrush you're
now easily 85 a nighttime sauce this
year over five roses up in a snap
checking us now and you're ready to go
you're miss new easy children's nail art
product live up to its presence there's
only one way to find out I have a 28
year old woman review it on YouTube
hello it's me Christine the nail girl
and today we're going to have some fun
with this girl god damn it when you
don't want to unpackage a nail package
with your nails good thing I have a
thousand degree night just kidding I
just really don't women talk about that
quality content me too Oh what do we
have here
destruction oh good I don't need an
instruction figurative to it I'm an
adult
I know it's childproof red giant pink
banana ring ring ring banana phone oh no
it's a purse and I really want to go to
the mall later but I don't have enough
allowance because I didn't clean my room
this weekend
marker I'm not even smelly one glitter
not hollow loskis taco but is this you
know the warrior princess weapon or
weapons this is you're dead now we got
some gems and bullshit I'm ready
what does this thing do look at this
with if your snake set up we guys on
they only gave me three markers and
there's five smarter holders excuse me
toys r us i want my money Macky hope eat
brush and traps there's a button switch
where does the paint look what what how
do you brush the air the battery up any
4c size batteries let's see see I'm too
been on need one more cat claw come on
this I knew perfect now what you be any
louder than an American maybe I should
read the instruction and now you can
create that salon look in your home with
the easy air now put the front wax down
and lift up the top cover I already did
bad recession up because I'm all remove
the easy air nail stylist what I didn't
there was no stylist included does not
seem very secure but ok glide a marker
into the stylus it doesn't run it so
slow oh hey did we get it is it is I
think it's us to reduce down that make
sense I don't know why the size I
thought you were supposed to do this not
a CD player Christine this is not how we
play music anymore what is this space
for how is like it's for a gun
that's thus weird and in this drawer you
can hide all of your little notes about
how much you hate your parents let's go
wish I had more slack I don't even know
which direction to blow it
you
like barely working fuck I pay good
money for this
fuck is that not recommended for kids
you don't want to wake up their parents
vibrate and I can't I can't hear you
that's their freakin other day actually
so I think I can conclude from my first
trial run that this is not a good blower
not snuff strong enough doesn't have the
right amount of blow blowing it's
literally just a little tiny gun of air
attempting to blow through a solid
marker how the fuck is that an airbrush
all children's toys are life I hate them
let's try another color mother now make
sure you blow it hard enough
no why any blue blue moans okay well all
these stupid stencils they don't even do
shit Wes tough it's bleeding what kind
of taco is this what does the do the
other colors oh well now I meant now I'm
intrigued tool it makes it darker god
damn it easy air now why didn't you tell
me it was that committee for best result
first apply a topcoat to nails 5 minutes
before applying airbrush marker code
sometimes I suppose we should read the
instructions we'll do it your way
easy ere now what else is it and I
didn't read caution the product includes
long cords which can be a risk of
entanglement or strangulation that's why
your mother really got this for you 5
container for 20 joules 40 confetti
sequins 20 rhinestones making sure I got
what I paid for 60 Andean bead folk is
an Indian beads so they just mean bead
like this regular beads warning do not
spread to face eyes or mouth yes you
can't do the full face of easy male
airbrush challenge alright now we're
worried the air now reload it let's see
if we have more left this time
it looks darker it doesn't work better
today Christine is gonna make a gradient
for the class
beautiful I'm getting good at this
bland shade let's put some sparkly shit
on it to make it even better beautiful
what's the fucker these tweezers Oh what
is this shit these will absolutely not
tweeze out and eyebrow hair honestly so
glad that I got this this baby right
here was really hard to get my nails on
they only sold them in kids toy stores
in the UK life is a British get has all
the Sun I just want to have fun - shut
up - Sami from the noasaurus for setting
this all the way over to Canada it was
well worth the trip
take a look at my creation they look
really good I can't wait to detach these
and sell them on eBay
well I think that was some really
important training we did they're good
now we got to get to the real thing
using the easy air now on my long hard
now I'm ready button the hatches first
things first
add a peel off base coat yes my nails
are stained yellow and kind of blue cuz
I'm a smurf and it's no crap - that
explains that now let me just cover
those up for you you can be a little
less uncomfortable with the color of my
nails on nail eraser hmm Maggie always
use protection
alright I'm ready first we're going to
add a glossy taco now it's time to blow
are you ready little good
there's nothing coming out refilling
he-man the times again area yeah wait
wait this is such a great noise
whip-snap can you guys guess with this
noise is ready
ah the magic topcoat
that looks like it was not the right
time of the month to be playing around
success it doesn't make any sense is
that when you put this glossy taco over
top it just blurs all of your little
dotted airbrushed effect what does this
have to say about that allow ink to dry
for 30 to 40 minutes you think kids have
time for that can't even spend 10
minutes watching until the end of the
YouTube video let's decorate dad emojis
suddenly I am impressed by this let's
peel this off to reveal the masterpiece
stillborn children's children Wow
don't these look great if you're a
parent looking for a toy to get for your
child to bring them from high
expectations to disappointment why not
get them the easy air nails perfect for
the whole family and you might now look
exactly like the nails of the teenage
girl on the box talk about living up to
your goals great way to motivate a child
to life well it's been fun but time for
you to leave this earth easy air now for
what you and your cousin the robot did
to me
they're just passionate I'm scared I
feel I don't know how to hold a hammer
Oh close
that's another day at the office one day
children will understand I see where you
belong Oh mommy needs a drink

other stupid mail products because I
