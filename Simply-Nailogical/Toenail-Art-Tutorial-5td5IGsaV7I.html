Christine again recently you may have
seen jenna Marbles doing her own acrylic
toe nails video in that video she
reveals one of my secrets
I've never done my toes on this channel
you've got me Jenna you got me good now
the first main reason why I haven't done
my toes is because I can't really reach
them I don't want to have to exercise
just to pay my fucking toenails okay
this isn't a workout it's such a big
deal that I even wrote about it in my
first single I would thank you want but
no names is that reach me before I was
famous I was a singer most of you are
used to simply nail on to quell
occasionally simply fake logical simply
illogical if we not logical whatever
logical today I am simply so logical
guess I should take my socks off there's
so much soup all right here we go I'm
getting naked as you can tell the last
time I painted my toenails was
approximately two years ago now polish
remover got my trusty little would do
your nails in the car desks here with me
today I've seen that video it was also
inspired by Jen Tamar get your own ideas
Christine now normally I would be
worried about doing what I'm doing
because I'd get the acetone on my
current manicure but given that recent
events that have made me very
self-conscious but
I don't give up anymore there you go my
naked ugly ass toes did I clearly never
take care today you guys asked for this
okay like so many of you I've been asked
me to do my toes really weird I'm gonna
use some cuticle remover get rid of
those maxi-cosi too cold let me see my
naked toes what do you think I did it
again what do you think what do you
think what do you think what do you
think what do you think
thanks for the tea may next we add some
nail oil because my toes are dry oh shit
I made this little pen myself in a
couple months I'm going to have a video
on how to grow your nails once I'm able
to successfully grow I've broken out
back up to what it used to be but for
now you can watch me doing home
lucky you don't be afraid to just load a
mop with oil and you're gonna massage it
in wonder people with foot fetishes are
actually getting horny right now all the
oil soaks in let's address this
situation with a song there is something
you can do about that is these big
things that are much bigger than this
that you can buy at the drugstore to
like shave off your skin I don't have
with them so I'm just gonna use this
really shitty nail file don't forget to
get a garbage this is going to be skin
everywhere when you're pretty much just
going to file your toes
kind of a Jenna I didn't see you file
your feet at your ratchet toe nail salon
I got one on you just ham oh my god it's
snowing disgusting oh yeah
quick nice nice nice I've always wanted
my foot could smell like a lemon oh yeah
this thing I shaved my legs well I mean
this is my ankle
for this video I'm not sure if I ever
mentioned this but I have flat feet I
thought about being a penguin before and
a penguin and I got pink feet but only
one thing I don't know if that made
sense to anyone else but me I don't know
why I have flat feet maybe I was meant
to be a fish whose class is creamier
minor Nicole Kidman now normally I would
only be filing my nails and I wouldn't
use these monsters I don't really give a
shit about my turnout so here we are I'm
not sure if you can fully see this but I
kind of have this permanent dent in my
toenail one time I stubbed my toe and
it's bled everywhere and I once included
that picture in a video a while that and
then the video got to monetize get this
first serious injury you can use to take
broken nail very seriously that's why
this picture needs to be censored but I
put the link for the video in which I
included the uncensored version of that
photo down below if you want to go check
it out because you were rebel or maybe
you just want the team wherever it is
kids say Tuesday
this was my actual nail I would be
crying right now I was make an entire
video book but no one ever sees your
feet I mean maybe if you live in a
warmer climate but not me okay I live in
Canada and either it's snowing all the
time from your work boots or when it's
summer you can't wear open-toed shoes
because you might get stepped on by a
moose it's just not safe this is
possibly the worst cringe compilation
for someone who hates feet and the
sounds of nails being filed
now that our toes are all files and
slightly less nasty it's time to paint
them hate those little piggies I have
these highly uncomfortable toe splitters
toe dividers toe songs first we need a
base coat I know this is not a peel off
base coat because I'm going to want to
keep this masterpiece on for a very long
time where did this all come from I
wasn't wearing that this is so
convenient I don't think I've ever been
able to just turn around and pick my
colors before without getting off my
knife do I have a plan No
so naturally y'all put some Hado on a
toenail because toenails are nailed to
equal rights no heart out that far toe
nails pinky toe is always so impossible
to paint I figure on the big toe we
should have a little fun with this first
let's put down some Hollow and some
liquid latex because we're going to do a
gradient been long time to do this mama
don't mean to sit bad damn damn I've
been working with my good boy let me
know my skills already oh crap oh it's
like the worst feeling in the world
too old food okay I'm back now we get to
deal oh she that was satisfying I figure
since my toenail is the biggest nail of
all the nails on my feet do some funky
nail art got to make use of that foot
real estate I'm going to use some man
vinyls yes I am NOT free-handing shit
it's really hard to work when I don't
have a table you know add a nice thick
coat of glossy Jack and now let that
your eye cuz we're gonna add never idle
next and cue the cat claw memory Cal
yeah classic simply know how to cool
hello we put on a white triangle BAM
Google I'm doing hazard again I feel
confidence growing within take your
dotting tool Ryan do this without
showing it all over your life and look
certain dirt right there because why not
note I think we're missing the elastic
silver linear house every pedicure needs
it instead of a pedicure or a manicure
what do you do when you're sick you get
the hollow cure I just give a shit here
I laugh at my own jokes with myself
is anyone else extremely nervous that
there's a giant tub of acetone sitting
here with the cat waiting to be still so
now I'm going to do what I said I wasn't
good which is free handsome chin but I
think it's really necessary to make your
pedicure amazing ah it hurt those
acetone on the couch it's okay
I'll blame it on the cat how are we
gonna do mr. big the big piggy and we're
going to fold Illuminati with this one
here can we change the light inside the
triangle if you get it outside the
triangle then you're immediately kicked
out a little nauseous
that's the rule okay I don't make them
very before dry very well we left this
foot dry in shit if you should do our
other foot now we all know I normally
never match my right hand my left foot I
figure it's a special occasion today
you're seeing my feet so I'm going to do
the same design on both feet so that way
I can say what's on my other foot it's
the exact same thing this one here
no please I need it closer but then then
I just talk like that it's very a
futuristic tribal the picture of your
family with your aunt esta you want it
out of here a peck it's here haha
okay leave me like everyone else now we
add a nice thick final coat a glassy
taco
okay we're done how do they look
oh yes
I forgot I can finally take these off
all eyes is less than looking on the
forum that's good right there
you look a little thirsty over here in
the corner I actually put effort into
the nail art please be proud of me now I
would love to give you guys a little
foot dance like Genesis but I can't flip
my toes apart at all can't even put
there Oh held it everywhere don't forget
to follow me on snapchat if you want to
see if I'm still wearing these this time
next year I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm sure you got a kick out of it
I think I did a terrific job really
