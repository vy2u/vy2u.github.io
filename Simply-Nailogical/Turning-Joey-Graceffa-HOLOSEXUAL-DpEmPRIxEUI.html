honest so now what we do is we use a gel
taco that's gel topcoat in English over
already sepia there who were like what I
feel like there's so many different
communities on here of the people I feel
like you're a part of a different
community i myself

this is so new that it doesn't even have
a real label it's just like a little
sharpie I know it looks kind of empty
because it may have tested it there we
go oh yeah this is how help me tears -
so basically what I do is I take this
magical stick menu coat just the tip oh

do you see it and we do often layers of
this sugar I'm ready I'm in shock at how
easy that was - yeah you don't need a
nail tech to do that right no oh

ever questioning your hollow sexuality
you are not questioning it now just pan
do you really think I'm a homosexual
I think you are don't ever feel
pressured count as a hollow sexual if
you're not ready no don't do it because
the cool kids are doing it don't do it
because your mom didn't your dad it's
not just a phase it's just who you are
the thing is you are not gonna offend
people and they can't be offended
because you're actually humble but if I
said that I wouldn't be allowed people
be like how Darren is stringent you're
all same as well I'm not offended and I
am thank you oh this looks amazing how
cool is that right I'm so happy it
actually works so if you tilt your
intimate like you see how the rainbow
shifts yes from me the right way yeah
