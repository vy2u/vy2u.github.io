of me
Christine of simply illogical just
kidding it on actually paint my nails
every single day but how cool would that
be if nail art was my job but it's not
so you're probably wondering how does
she make this nail art Hollow
like everything about this nail art is
hollow what are these magical hollow
unicorns that simply no logical has
stuffed in her closet
so the original nail art was not hollow
as you can see and it looks pretty cool
like this if you ask me it kind of looks
like a cool turtle am I not early enough
for the turtle club he's fine pearl
pearl
he's dreamt of this place ever since he
was a child all right let's go and I
shall unlock the magical hollow secrets
of the world I start off with a black
base I'm using Colt nails Nevermore oh
my god why am i painting my nails black
they're not white what's going on here
and apparently I can't even paint my
nails today and many of you have asked
me how do you paint your nails so
perfectly well I guess it can help you
there can I maybe I just felt like
painting the table okay okay I'm clearly
having a bad day look away paint your
nails just do it they say with chillax
bye picture polish I love this aqua
creme so creamy look at it so you're
probably wondering like why are you
painting your ring finger at different
color than black what is going on it's
actually because I just wanted to see
what the opposite of the mania had
planned what actually look like because
sometimes you just want to play office a
day on your nails when you can't paint
your nails perfectly like I can't just
use a cleanup brush like this one which
I got from twinkle tea and dip it in a
bit of acetone and outline your nail and
then it's like the mess never happened
now I'm applying simply peel around my
nail to protect my finger from gradient
mess and if you don't know what simply
peel is then you clearly live under a
rock and you need to watch this video in
the left hand corner right now go now
now while you let simply
he'll Drive for a couple minutes you can
take your quick dry top coat and apply
it to all your black nails this is
because we're going to be using nail
vinyls next now go back to the accent
nail are you following are you following
stay with me guys I'm using chillax
again in some random teal color from Kuo
which is a company that you've probably
never heard of because they only sell it
in Canada and here the hell lives in
Canada except me
where are my Canadians at comment below
I apply both colors side by side on a
foundation makeup sponge and you can see
that I'm overlapping the colors in the
middle just to make it blend a little
bit better on the nail go ahead and dab
dab dab on the nail don't be shy get
right in that girl give it a little dab
give it a light gentle dab a little up
and down dab a little zigzag action you
got it girl
don't lay it on too thick remember
you're good I have a chance to do a
second coat you don't have to let the
nail fully dry before you do a second
Bungie coat but don't let it be super
wet either somewhere in the middle like
by the time you finish your other four
nails then you're good to go for your
second round or actually by the time you
finish your eight nails if you're a
normal person and you paint both hands
the same peel off simply peel like no
big deal someone requested that I
actually narrate that for some reason
you guys are so weird
don't worry simply peel we're not
finished with you apply simply peel
around all of your black nails because
we're gonna do a gradient on top of the
Black Radiance grit ends gradients all
day every day I love gradients and I
hate water marbling so as you let simply
peel dry for a couple minutes go ahead
and add a quick dry top coat to your
accent now you're probably like oh my
god so many steps I can't keep track
what now am i painting what am i doing
am i putting like this sticky stuff on
or am i putting a topcoat or colors or
sponges I don't even know anymore
let the quick dry top coat dry for
fifteen to twenty minutes because now
we're gonna stick on some nail vinyls
finally it has happened to me
I got vine us from twinkle tea yeah yeah
he's awesome intersecting diamond
extravaganza pattern nail vinyls are
from twinkle tea calm and you can use my
code simply for 10% off all of the
vinyls so just peel it off the sheet
lift fit so funky place it directly on
the nail and then to make the peeling
off process when you're done a little
bit easier I like to cut a little slice
on each side of the vinyl
make sure you've got it firmly pressing
on the nail ooh hello sneak peek and I'm
just taking my black polish and I'm
applying a somewhat generous coat over
top of the nail vinyls and make sure you
cover everything a little diamond you
got to get all the little spaces while
the Polish is still wet
peel up the vinyl with a pair of
tweezers and you can see I just kind of
pulled it from each end a little bit and
then killed it off cutting it before
definitely helps with that all right
back to the middle nail so we're gonna
do a gradient on the nail file this time
just to change things up and make it
more complicated but question should you
use the same sponge you just use like
twenty-seven minutes ago
no because you shouldn't use the part of
the sponge it has a dirty dried up
polish and yes because you can actually
use the same sponge just cut off that
dirty dry part this way you will
preserve sponges so you can do gradients
for literally the rest of your life oh
and this is probably good for the
environment or something to not waste
punches I don't know I'm not really a
tree hugger now normally I wouldn't
recommend using a light color to sponge
or apply over a dark color like I've
done here with this aqua or black but in
this case the picture polished chillax
formula is super opaque so it did really
well good job picture polish peel off
the nail vinyl and some of the simply
peel and oh my god it's happening again
a nail artists worst nightmare when you
go to peel off something and it tries to
peel off the base because you use a peel
off base coat don't worry guys this is
not the fault of the nail vinyl it's my
fault for using a peel off base coat
because I'm just like you know super
lazy and I want to be able to peel my
manicures off when I'm done with them
but don't worry random nail tool to the
rescue I had to save it because let's be
honest there's no point how it's gonna
redo this so it it taking me like
another two hours when you're done don't
forget to have a fresh sponge for next
time
cut the sponge cut the sponge cut the
sponge keep cutting the sponge cut all
the sponges make sure you're using super
sharp scissors because if you used old
crappy scissors like these it won't cut
and this will happen clearly these
scissors are evil and curse because look
there's rust and bloody hollow glitter
look it's my sponge slice collection I'd
like to arrange them in opposite ways
okay and now we're done or so you think
add a topcoat to seal it all in and
there I have the world snazziest turtle
on my nails whoo hallo oh yeah
distracted by the hollow I can't help it
I just got an email a few days ago and I
super pass it only took like three days
of shipping this is fun lacquer diamonds
taco like legit a diamond in a bottle
actually now scratch that
better than diamond it's Hollow
Halloween's holographic for all you
people out there who do live under a
rock oh my God look at this so basically
a hollow taco means that you can top it
over anything and make it Hollow okay I
know that this top coat is expensive
okay but I sacrifice like three or four
maybe five Starbucks lattes to get it so
therefore it's worth it because hollow
is worth everything to me but I've tried
much cheaper alternatives like this
random ten dollar one I got from some
indie company and I mean it looks hollow
in the bottle and there's a bow on it
and some strange rhinestone and on the
brush it looks hollow too but let's test
them out beside each other so this is
fun lacquer hollow diamond topcoat and
this is random indie brand half the
price hollow topcoat clearly the fun one
wins in terms of hollow payoff because
you see that there's a lot more little
holographic rainbow things going on now
what about something like I love nail
polishes famous mega the thing is that
while this polish is awesome and super
hollow it's not meant to be a taco it's
just meant to go on its own and be
opaque in two or three coats in
comparison it's a lot thicker which is
great for when you want to use it alone
by itself on your nails but it's not
good as a taco because if you use
something like
this as a topcoat it's going to cloud
your entire mani or end the color or the
design there's one important thing you
need to know though before you apply a
hollow topcoat
you have to apply it in the least number
of strokes as possible because if you
apply two strokes over top of each other
it's already going to become two coats
and then your man is gonna get cloudy
but how cool is this effect am i right
this hollow topcoat took this many from
plain boring turtle to super stylish
sassy turtle because who doesn't love
hollow hollow makes the world a better
place and if you don't like it then well
haters gonna hate
Paula's gonna Hollow and she's gonna
mint you alright well that's it for
today guys make sure to leave me a
comment below and let me know if you're
gonna put holo on everything from now on
cuz I totally am thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
