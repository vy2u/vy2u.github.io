please welcome back simply now logical
because today I did what I actually like
doing and not being obsessed with
gradients and nail vinyls
after that Russian witchcraft spree of
my last two videos is time to get back
to my roots
put down that white face coat girl oh
yeah love that creamy whiteness slap on
that simply feel next oh yeah liquid
latex away the future find my favorite
white polish and my favorite cuticle
pilaf stuff at a link below in the video
description box let's start with the
blue to white gradient first I got two
random blue polishes and the white milk
colors again don't ask me why I put it
on the makeup sponge in this order stab
dev dev that blue gradient on and focus
the dark blue part towards your cuticles
shove the blue end of the spawns red in
there girl so you can cover up the white
part put the base of the nail add some
more on the sponge in the wrong order
again
add a second layer of gradient tang so
you can make it nice and opaque like
beautiful ocean as deep as your eyes
take some tweezers and peel off simply
feel like no big deal except this one
was kind of an annoying deal cuz I left
some trapper on my cuticle do as I say
not as I do
if the Polish is second little stupid
stubborn pieces I like to take it too
thick first and kind of scratch it out
try not to butcher your cuticles like it
looks like I'm doing here though I got
some brand-new cleanup brushes from
twinkle tea set that one that's a nail
art brush let this a fancy they've all
got these crystal things on the other
end it's a little weight to them they
got protect your caps and everything
it's soft but it's still firm which is
key for cleanup they're made with
kolinsky hair fancy I don't know why
that's good but it's good I'm going to
use number six here so first I just
brush off the mess I made with my
toothpick take some acetone or some nail
polish remover whatever dip your brush
in just the tip so grab it lightly on a
paper towel and use it to clean
carefully around the edges of your
creations
any nail art for that matter obviously
it's hard to take off my actual cuticle
and then using the acetone brush to
clean it around the stupid beautiful hog
I insisted on shoving that blue sand
deep into my cuticle to cover up the
white ends up taking the blue off the
white anyways you could avoid this
potential mess by choosing to put the
lightest color of your gradient towards
your cuticle I didn't cause I'm stubborn
and now I go back and fix my life
choices if only it could be this easy
for the things you did in high school
okay we're back on track now add a quick
dry top coat so you know what's coming
next
that's right we're gonna add nail vinyls
back to simply illogical that everyone
can predict let it dry for 15-20 minutes
while we're waiting let's take care of
our brush dip it in the water dab it on
the paper towel take a drop of cheap
cuticle oil just wanna mention hair all
over it the oil will soak right into the
brush and leave it super soft and supple
for next time cap it up and you just
cleaned your cleanup brush they make so
much sense here than L arche now vinyl
Todd yes finally getting my six peeling
off the bundles on
yeah my god these wave vinyls are
twinkle tea obviously and use my code
simply 10% off we had you don't ride the
wave today stick it on the nail and
firmly press it down everywhere half of
the finals getting in my way so I'm
gonna take my clunky scissors and cut it
the only scissors I have add some simply
peel around the sides now hold on a
second we could protect that bottom blue
part by adding simply peel but I'm
wearing a peel off base coat so if I do
that and peel it off it will probably
risk peeling up my home Annie so I'm
just gonna have to be extra careful cut
the sponge because you're a nail larding
environmentalist we're going to sponge
on another gradient of red and orange
creme colors I don't know why that
yellow fair cuz I didn't use it this
time we're going in order yes sponge it
on I gotta be extra careful not to go
past the edge of the purple vinyl thing
and accidentally get my reddish orange
wigs on my blue wave and holy crap wow
that was just one coat this was how
opaque that is my god this is so amazing
these are floss floss I'm super
impressed with these orange polishes
being so light and all going over blue
and all their floss cloth friends and I
put some links to them in the video
description box below the last gloss
Laska Wow that trying to do that five
times fast it's not possible that was
two coats to make it extra creamy grab
your tweezers and you're going to
carefully peel up the simply peel around
the side of your nail and the nail
button now don't do it in this direction
like I did analyze it at that direction
I blame
camera angles miss me up all the time
but you want to peel the vinyl pen
upwards towards the tip of whatever
vinyl sheet it is so really I should
have peeled up from this side into the
wave that's right rad the way there we
go
how cool is that kit add a topcoat to
seal that gradient magic in em I feel
like myself again guys this feels so
good on the inside
oh yes so many possibilities with these
now vinyl Scott is it a blue way or red
base or a Blue Wave or red way Blue Wave
runway Blue Wave anyway we will never
know it's an optical illusion in front
of hollow bread with blue as you are
slowly going and singing we're gonna go
out and buy all the hala polishes and
some hollaback bread schools are super
fun all right how do I say buy in this
video bye guys I'm trying to wait until
you cry so I'm gonna use a claw no
that's all wrong guys
