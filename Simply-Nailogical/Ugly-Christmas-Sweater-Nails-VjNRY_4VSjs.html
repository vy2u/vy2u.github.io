tough-girl a or the mail sweep go all
the way
okay well hallo there it's me christine
again do you know what time of year it
is
it's a motherfuck holidays a load days
holidays in case you didn't get it we're
gonna get to my nails soon but first
what's on my other what's on my body
what what what's on my shirt I am
wearing my limited edition simply swag
holiday sweater what do you think about
that
it has that ugly Christmas sweater kind
of style but I think it's beautiful I
mean look at these nail emojis it also
has cats on it nail polish bottle
sparkle emoji got some snowflakes and
trees and stars and bullshit and
whatever the fuck that is how this is
what the holidays are all about am i
right am i right I'm right yes if you
want one I put the link below in the
video description box and you can get
them right now in time for Christmas and
this time around I got the sweater
available in both adult and youth sizes
make sure to follow me on snapchat and
I'll give a little demo of the sizes
don't you want to dress your entire
family in these gay Christmas family
portrait now fellow homosexuals I know
what you're thinking but where's the
challah I totally get it but
unfortunately they couldn't print the
hollow with such small designs and it
would have made this too expensive that
you couldn't buy Christmas presents for
anyone else and now to remind everyone
and myself that I'm a nail artist
supposedly I'm going to try and recreate
my sweater design on my nail get excited
because I'm doing nail art let's see if
I still remember how starting off with a
peel off base coat and I'm gonna add one
coat of super Santa red nail polish to
match one of my sweaters seal it in with
a nice thick coat of glossy taco and let
it dry because we're going to use
acrylic paint
next I'm also painting another nail navy
blue like this litter and a bright green
nail is well don't have a video of me in
that sweater but you'll survive while I
was letting those dry I remembered that
I had ugly Christmas sweater nail vinyls
help perfect I used these in a nail art
design last year I thought they turned
out pretty cool except I only have one
vinyl left I guess I'm going to have to
try and use skills and make the ugly
Christmas sweater pattern myself I'm
starting off taking some Chevron nail
vinyls putting it on my nail art mat
sealing out the one in the middle
because we're gonna use these as a
stencil applying some white polish
between the two nail vinyls peeling it
up before it dries don't let the shit
dry and I'll just add a thin layer of
clear nail polish so that it's easier to
peel up later when it's dry but that
should dry and now I'm going to take
some striping tape and we're gonna make
whatever the fuck this shape is so you
take four pieces of striping tape and
make them into this shape grab some
white acrylic paint because it's a bit
easier to work with than nail polish I'm
using a skinny skinny striping brush to
try and paint these little triangular
components of this snowflake or whatever
the fuck this shape is called nobody
knows but we all know it has to do with
the holidays if you fuck up you can take
a toothpick and gently scratch it off
because you've added a glossy taco and
let it dry long enough underneath if you
were working with regular nail polish
you wouldn't be able to use the
toothpick trick so there's a hack for
you always use acrylic paint if you
don't know how to paint and you
anticipate ping it up once you complete
all the triangles it's starting to look
like that shape that no one knows the
name of you'll off all the striping tape
to reveal it and yes some of the acrylic
paint went under the tape so just
scratch that off I do so much scratching
I'm surprised I haven't won the lotto
yet fix up some little areas if you need
to and now that my white decal Chevron's
are dry I'm going to
I'm up I'm adding some clear nail polish
at the bottom of my nail to make it
sticky and just stick that on like a
sticker sometimes it's a lot easier to
make your own decals like this so you
can get the placement exactly right
where you want on your nail and just
gently trim off the excess around the
nail and do the same thing for a chevron
at the top of the nail I like to use my
cleanup brush dipped in a little bit of
acetone to help melt and seal the edges
and now because this is looking pretty
basic and my sweater is more complicated
than this I'm going to try and add some
tiny little star shape things first to
look okay I've done good so far but as I
went on my hand just kept shaking more
and more and yeah it only got worse onto
the blue nail this is the hardest nail
of all because it requires completely
free hand painting the nail emoji which
I have never done which most nail
artists have done so I'm just starting
with some white acrylic paint and a lot
of hesitation oops
the fingers kind of look like sausages
so I'm keeping that in mind as I paint
and then the nails the white was just
for a messy outline okay it's like a
draft and now I'm gonna paint it yellow
like the default skin tone emoji which
is supposed to be ambiguous and not
suggest any particular ethnicity over
another my honest rationale for choosing
the yellow emoji is that it's the
default emoji that's not actually
reflective of true human skin colors
kind of like in the Simpsons or Lego
people it's fictional therefore it can
apply equally to all yes for equality
and inclusion we cannot provide the
sweater with every single option of skin
tone nail emojis I hope you understand
anyways that is my explanation for why
denial emoji on my sweater is yellow and
if that triggers you you don't have to
buy it now I was too lazy to get out my
brown acrylic paint for the lines
between the fingers so I just mixed the
pink with the yellow and I got this
color perfect to find those yellow
sausages now we got to put some ugly
Christmas sweater shit around the nails
because the nails are looking lonely
here's a straight line that wasn't so
straight and me trying to cover up the
nose mistakes I kind of looks like
carpet rug frills now but let's just
pretend it
looks like Christmas now let's paint a
tree not because of Christmas but
because trees are often present in the
world on land yeah it's just like
stacking a bunch of triangles
it's like geometry class so don't say it
didn't teach you anything then I added
those weird things around not the top
and bottom that I could not film now I'm
attempting to paint the sparkle emoji
still attempting yes on my pinkie I did
this amazing snowflake look how perfect
it is psych I use nail vinyls to make
that snowflake by the way if you were
ever annoyed at cleaning up your nail
art mat with acetone because it's just
like gets your fingers all messy and
shit by letting the painter polish fully
dry and then just use a lint roller
you're a cat lady like me I'm sure you
have plenty of these look at that pickup
it's amazing and now we gonna seal our
holidays design in with a nice thick
coat of glassy taco when working with
acrylic paint sometimes one coat of
glossy taco doesn't do it once the taco
dries there is a bit of unevenness from
the acrylic paint that comes through so
we add a second coat of glassy taco oh
yeah and I just wanted to show you the
glossy taco porn from all the fingers
perfect nicely freshly sealed for
Christmas don't ask me what's on my
thumb it was supposed to be the cat
emoji but it ended up looking like one
of those dramatic masks oops now
honestly I'm pretty proud of myself for
being able to do most of this freehand
but it's still missing something hmm
what could it be the mother fuck I love
taco that's what oh yeah how some hollow
taco on to get in the true holiday
spirit now I wish hollow tacos existed
for clothing imagine the possibilities
you just put it on every single one of
your pieces of clothes you'd slap it on
your sweater your shirt your face
everything you put that shit on
everything but unfortunately that
doesn't exist for clothes at least I'm
still waiting maybe one day
clothing designers take note it's okay
as long as your nails are hollow also my
holiday sweater is limited edition which
means that you won't be able to get it
after this Christmas we're gonna be
selling them for a few weeks I put the
specific date down below in the video
description box along with the direct
link to shop don't buy any that might
pop up on Amazon because those would be
fake those mother
thieves are grinches I only sell through
whoever I provide the link for
that if you want to get these sweaters

Christmas then you got to make sure to
order early to allow time for shipping
