Christmas and that means I do ugly
sweater nails because they're so awesome
except these nails didn't really turn
out all that ugly as I'd planned in my
head but hey hollow glitter can't help
it it's so beautiful so before I get to
the not ugly ugly Christmas sweater
nails I'm gonna show you a nail fail I
had first so originally I thought it
would be cool to use a textured polish
so it looked like a fuzzy sweater but
then everything went wrong first of all
I was using a peel-off base coat but I
always live dangerously with that risk
but I also wasn't able to put a quick
dry polish over the green fuzzy polish
because if I did that then it would take
away the fuzzy sweater effect which was
the whole point of what I was going for
so I failed and I took it all off and I
scrapped the idea of a fuzzy sweater
nail art I rethought what I was gonna do
and start it over with a non peel-off
base coat because you can't live
dangerously all the time I'm using a
milky white polish for once I know how
disgusting is it because I wanted an
off-white kind of ivory this one's
called white chocolate I think and it's
supposed to smell like white chocolate
which is even weirder I applied two
thick coats to make it completely opaque
and yeah I guess it kind of does
resemble the color of white chocolate
now I'm craving white chocolate where's
the wind doors and I did the accent now
with a red hollow as the base because I
often like to see things in the opposite
color see this polish is actually called
rose bar I put the link below and I
think people think it's pink but I'm
pretty sure it's red oh is this another
case of what color is this dress what
color is this polish what do you see is
it red or is it pink or is it red or is
it pink or is it Fred probably red yeah
it's definitely red it's the great
Christmas debate add a quick dried top
coat to all your nails red and white
because then we're gonna have no puddles
because I can't freehand draw look
at these nail vinyls aren't these like
the best nail vinyls to ever exist
they're called ugly Christmas sweater
nail vinyls and they're from twinkle
tea of course you should tell your
parents that you can get 10% off with my
code simply and then say hey you can't
catch me I'm the gingerbread man so
because these vinyls are very intricate
with tiny tiny designs they are going to
be a little more challenging to unpeel
as you see that I'm having issues right
here but you'll get it eventually and if
you have a few pieces that are stuck
just poke them out with a toothpick
these vinyls are actually pretty long so
you could cut them in half if you have
short nails but because my nails are
long I need like 3/4 of the vinyl to
complete the look cut around the sides
of the vinyls and in fact it's probably
best to cut it in half around that line
area because then you will have more
freedom to peel up the vinyls so I can
peel it up into goes cut off all the
excess crap if you want it does make it
easier to peel off and then smooth down
the vinyl to make sure that you've got
no bumps or air pockets or whatever
purple Hollow that's not Christmassy at
all but it's still pretty look at that
rainbow shine this is one of color clubs
essential you need a must and have to
have one of these hollows these make the
best stocking stuffers your parents
don't put hollow and your stocking then
they're not your parent I'm going to use
a whole bunch of different colored
hollows that are kind of Christmasy
color I don't know to fill in the little
spaces in the vinyl I put the link below
to all the polishes down in the video
description box so start filling in your
nail vinyl designs with different color
hollows whatever colors you want but
make sure to just fill in one half of
the side of the vinyl so you can peel it
up first alright let's see how this goes
shouldn't rip up the base because I used
a regular base coat for once excellent
that worked out just fine now remember
you got to work quickly because that
line down the middle is starting to dry
and things get ugly and messy when they
start to dry you have to peel off the
vinyls while all the polish is still wet
so you really can't afford to be using
your slow brain today you have saved
that one for school because you got to
use your quick brain to get this done in
time let's try this nobody breathes stop
really stop it
Oh where'd my gingerbread men go they
ran all the way home back into the oven
literally that brown hollow dries a lot
faster than the other polishes I used
weird so I just take a tiny dotting tool
I got from twinkle tea
dip it in the brown and then remake the
gingerbread man myself
let's do it again but with opposite
colors except you don't really need me
to describe this because if you heard it
the first time then you don't need to
hear it again
I'll just tell a story instead so my
name is Christine and if you didn't know
that my name is Christine and you may or
may not have noticed that it's not
spelled the usual way with an H so one
day a few years ago I was in grad class
and my professor looks at the class list
on the first day of class and says to me
Oh Christine I think they spelled your
name wrong on the class list that's
actually how he talks and I replied to
him something to the effect of well no
sir I don't think so unless you mean to
suggest that my name should be
pronounced Christ Dean because if you
separate the traditional spelling of the
word Christine into two it says Christ
team just like Christopher should be
said Christ Topher just like Christmas
should be Christ miss because aren't
these things all supposed to be related
to Christ at least that's what wikipedia
tells me I am also not the daughter of
Christ I am the daughter of the devil
the hollow glitter devil that is and
therefore I conclude that in all of
history anyone who said the name
Christine Christopher and Christmas has
been pronouncing it incorrectly for
hundreds of centuries and if they really
didn't want it to be pronounced Christ
miss and they wanted it to be pronounced
Christmas then why is there H in the
word Christmas in conclusion the next
time you write Merry Christmas on a
holiday greeting card be sure to spell
it like this and when people tell you
you spelled it wrong just say no you
spelled it wrong bitch simply no logical
told me so okay story time is over
hmm these ugly Christmas sweater nails
are missing something
what could it be what could it be mono
glitter from twinkle tea hey so I just
take a clear polish and paint stripes
wherever I plan on putting the hollow
glitters down don't use a top coat
because that'll dry too fast and just
take a toothpick and stick it on your
tongue to make it a little wet and pick
up the glitters one by one and there you
you add a gold glitter stripe I'm gonna
add another stripe of hollow glitter to
cover up more this boring white
chocolate cream color but let's use some
bright green hollow yeah I guess this is
the only color I was kind of missing in
my nail polish holo collection wasn't it
now I can't really do us too ripe here
because that is as things in so I'm just
gonna fill in free little red dots so it
kind of looks like Halle Berry's I need
hollow berries ha ha let's put a little
star at the top of the tree weight stars
are not red that makes no sense
okay let's scratch that and put a gold
star on the top of the tree did I just
say trop of the tree uh-huh
too much eggnog in my system and now we
gonna decorate the red nail since you
don't need to hear how again I'll just
tell another story I'm just kidding
that's enough Christine stop talking add
a nice glossy top coat to seal all those
hollow glitters in and make them shine
if your parents don't give you hollow
glitter for Christmas and I sure hope
Santa does cuz if he doesn't then he's a
dick Oh ugly Christmas sweater it's not
ugly it's so pretty actually I like it I
like it a lot alright everyone an effort
to not offend anyone I'm just gonna say
Happy Holidays instead of citing a
particular religious traditional holiday
and you can't be offended by that
because if you watch this channel then
you must be a hollow sexual and we all
practice hollow ism this time of year
and every other time if you see y'all
later
