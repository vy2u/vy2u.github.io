unicorns got twisted upside down you
will learn the secret history of the
world actually no this is the official
story of the unicorn so there's this
nail polish that you may have heard of
that's nicknamed unicorn King it
currently sells on Amazon and eBay for
the same amount that you might use to
put food on your table for an entire
week seventy dollars a hundred dollars
two hundred and fifty dollars leather
because this nail polish so expensive
supply-and-demand girls supply and
demand it's only basic microeconomics
I'm not sure unicorn fees original
listing price but some say it's
currently being sold for over five times
its original value that is before was
discontinued in 2008 this little guy's
actual name is clearance 230 the valley
multi o'clock yes you'll be sick cafes
been lalalala lalalalala but it was
renamed to unicorn pee because it's hard
to find and obviously because it's
magical why is it so magical and elusive
welcome to simply history class 102
where you will learn the official
history of unicorn pee put away your
Instagram and get your notebooks out
people in 1801 there was a clan of
unicorns that lived down in the meadow
by the valley and ate sunlight for
breakfast one day a local horror poor I
didn't need to stay for one day a local
horse carriage buggy man who was jealous
that his horse is just a horse and that
Unicorn stumbled upon a pool of liquid
in the road it was a magical pool
shimmering liquid then shifted from
green to yellow to orange to red to
purple and I saw many color started
splashing the pool because he's just
like an immature little boy and then you
saw the magical shifting properties
happening on his fingers he was so
curious and stupid that he decided to
put his fingers in his mouth he died the
very next day the leprechaun found the
dead horse but he died by the pool of
match and getting in a shed that the guy
was dead because humans were always mean
to leprechauns anyway but he was
entranced by the magical pool of liquid
he knew immediately that it must be a
bodily excrement from the unicorn
bloodline because back in the day
leprechauns and unicorns were besties
good times good time he carefully
gathered the unicorn pea into his flask
and went to hide it under a pillow
because he's a freak a week later an
evil troll was policing the Leprechaun
territory that's how things were back
then you don't like the Bloods and the
Crips the evil troll caught a glance at
the Leprechaun splash and while the
Leprechaun was off looking for gold or
something at the end of a rainbow evil
troll broke into his house and stole the
flask of unicorn piss then went under a
bridge to meet up with his troll buddies
and they were all freaking out over what
he found I know what this is it's
unicorn king holy they do exist I
have an idea but sell it for a profit
and so the trolls being greedy and all
backtrack to the leprechauns house and
then to the road where the unicorn pee
was in a pool the horse carriage man was
so lying dead there no one cares patrol
leader clarin ordered his subordinate
trolls to kidnap all the unicorns all
230 of them they brought the unicorns
back under the bridge gave them too much
to drink and order them to pee in a cup
the unicorns didn't really understand so
they just listen and eat everywhere as a
result of this unicorn pee milking farm
the trolls started selling the unicorn
pee to large cosmetics companies for mad
cash
as they were now rich they got to
upgrade their troll bridge into a castle
with a bridge ender and so the nail
polish was sold at clearance 2:30
fast-forward 200 years one day in 2008
the unicorns finally overheard that the
trolls were selling their tea in the
nail-polish industrial complex
unicron's decided it was their right to
sell their pea and not the trolls so
they all went on strike and stopped
peeing shortly after that they all died
of kidney disease because they wouldn't
let themselves urinate and that's what
led to the extinction of the unicorn a
group of unicorn activists established
the unicorn pee trade Protection Act
that would make it illegal for cosmetics
companies to distribute the unicorn pee
for a drop after the Act was implemented
clearance 230 Productions
Domini inevitably that just meant that
unicorn pee would go straight to the
black market that's why today in 2015
unicorn pee is sold for ridiculous
prices on the Internet's some have tried
to replicate it or duplicate it or
imitate it but there is ZERO substitute
for the magical properties of the
unicorn pee okay so none of that was
true except for the part that uniform
pee is sold at ridiculous prices that's
true so at this point you're probably
asking yourself but simply me illogical
is unicorn pee really worth a small
fortune I'm gonna go with no because
well first of all it's not Hama yes it
is a color shifting shimmer blah blah
and we're doing for a multi-car whatever
but it still ain't hollow
personally I always thought that
unicorns were something that we
attribute to rainbows and since Hollow
is the truest form of rainbow it's just
weird to me that we decided to call this
unicorn key and not like a hollow
topcoat or something I put a link down
below for where I get all my favorite
Hellas you know like a whole bunch of
them for the same price is one unicorn
fee yes it's something you have to read
next you're probably asking or maybe
you've already commented why would you
buy yourself that pea then if it's not
worth it Christine
don't jump to conclusion people I didn't
buy it my boyfriend bought it for me got
it for my last birthday or something
because he figured if he just bought me
the world's most expensive nail polish I
wouldn't need to buy any other nail
polish ever again and that's just simply
not logical I love your colors
gangway that's an appropriate pad cake
patty cake bake me a cake it that'sa
men'she you hit me so long you being
told to me by everyone please subscribe
to our channel so I can go to call it
thank y'all very much I believe I can
fly eat all the birdies up in the sky
okay she's just turns into a wet blanket
in front of the camera she'll let me do
anything with her I wanna be a unicorn
kitty why would anyone ever want
children you have this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
