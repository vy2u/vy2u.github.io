rainbows but right now it is well hallo
everyone it's me christine again and i'm
doing actual nail art again holy shit
amana voice if you subscribe to this
channel long before polish mountain then
guess what you're finally getting least
effort so I'm starting off with a not
peel off base coat because I know how
sad no peel form has I'm using vinyls
today and there was too much risk they
would peel off the peel off base coat so
we go the traditional route today now
I'm adding some creamy white polish
because we don't got no place for milky
polishes on this channel now do we no
I'm using these pili apron thingies to
protect my skin while I do the dab
gradient and these are latex-free
a lot you guys have that question so you
can still use these even if you have a
latex allergy be careful with condoms
you use though I mean what no that took
a whole other direction
now we're going to do a rainbow gradient
on makeup sponge now this gradient is
not the easiest of all gradients because
I'm using six different colored polishes
to make a rainbow before I start dabbing
on the nail I like to apply two layers
of the polish on the sponge first
because the first layer gets too
absorbed into the sponge and there's
what's not much nail polish left over so
now we've got the fresh paint and then
we gon dab dab dab it right on the nail
I'll be careful my children to not move
the sponge too much around or else
you're just going to have all the colors
mixed and it'll probably look like shit
but maybe literally because I think if
you mix all the rainbow colors it looks
round so don't do that dab on your
diagonal rainbow gradient and very thin
coat so don't worry if it wasn't that
pigmented on the first dab because we
gon do it again as best as that def def
def dub dub dub dub dub dub dub dub rubs
up up up wow if you say job a lot of
times fast it sounds like you're saying
blob try it I dare you when your rainbow
has reached maximum rain bonus you're
going to peel ACK no big deal then you
can take a small brush dipped in a
little bit of acetone to clean up and
Edge's so this rainbow is good enough
but you know what no rainbow is a
rainbow without a hollow taco that's rat
I'm adding a scattered hallo taco on my
rainbow so my rainbow becomes a double
rainbow now we going to seal it in with
a quick dry glossy taco because we're
gonna add now vials next totally shit
it's been so long since I said that I
gotta say it feels good guys feel good
like this video if it feels good for you
too in case you're new here we got to
add a quick dried taco because it really
solidifies the Polish and then when you
put a nail line on it won't peel up the
Polish underneath then you let it dry
for a good 15 to 20 minutes so long as
you're using a good quick dry taco now
we're going to use some unicorn now
vials to bitch on that free hand
painting shit on my nails
oh shit but well wait a second what's
that on my other hand oh it's a dark
elegant royal purple indigo beautiful
linear hollow oh my god one of my
favorite things ever is dark hollow dark
hollow like my soul you're going to peel
off the outer part of the unicorn vinyl
look at that perfect nobody got a draw
shit stick it on your nail fill in the
unicorn head with an opaque white nail
polish and while it's still wet don't
let this dry I'm going to take some
hollow glitter that I got at the
drugstore surprisingly I know this has
been around since like 2005
Wow hollow texture will forever and just
dab it on top of the white unicorn head
again the polish still has to be wet
because you want it to stick to it don't
you could just dump that shit on but I'm
trying to spare the hollow glitter you
know what I mean like it has feelings
then you peel off the unicorn head vinyl
and BAM bitch I'm a unicorn well that
was easy but wait I'm not done had to
make it more complicated for no
particular reason Perry I'm applying
some nail art foil glue because I
thought what if I want to add a layer of
iridescent oil on top of my hollow
glitter unicorn head so that's what I
did this is some opalescent iridescent
nail art foil wait about a minute to let
the foil glue dry and then we're just
going to tap
on just tap it on the unicorn hand and
peel it up and it kind of looks almost
the same as did before I did this step
okay whatever leave me alone you can see
the iridescent opalescent shift and some
lighting and I thought that was really
cool to kind of catch the pinkish or
greenish tinge to the unicorn head but
yeah I mean I agree it's not that
obvious whatever I had a final glossy
taco to seal it all in and the world has
restored its order again because I have
rainbows holo taka unicorn holo glitter
and opalescent unicorn and tinfoil on my
nails Wow shit that is a nail full I'm
just going to pose here with some
unicorn skin unicorn skin over holo one
of my favorite combos alright well
that's all I got for you today life is
good life is great we're in the holo
nail dejalo read the holo beat the holo
in this work alright Paulo sexual out
and thanks so much for watching I'll see
y'all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
