little riddle for you to start off this
video if we know that this magical
rainbow tissue is unicorn skin and I
know this because I personally peeled
the skin off of Charlie to put it on my
nails and that this magical rainbow
shifting liquid held captive in a nail
polish bottle is unicorn pee do you see
the shift can you see it of course you
can unless you're blind then what part
of the unicorn body is this at first
glance you might think it looks like
seaweed but I'm a unicorn scientist and
so I can tell you that seaweed is not
part of the unicorn body it is a plant
these are unicorn veins guys obviously
just look at that network of capillaries
and where does any part of the unicorn
body belong on our nails duh yeah let's
do this I start off with a peel off base
coat because I like to peel things off
my nails especially unicorn body parts
and oh my god yes my nails are yellow
hurry up and go write a comment that
responsible eyes is someone else about
their health now I'm gonna apply some
black polish I'm using the winning
polish from my what's the best black
polish video the drugstore edition and
I'm putting some weight on my other nail
because I like me some variety there's
also a video on what's the best white
polish you can go watch that too yay so
much education I'm now adding my current
favorite quick dry top coat I put a link
below to that you can also get 10% off
this taco with my code simply if it's
not sold out I'm scoria don't control
order stalking and now let that quick
dry top coat dry hey it's the cat walk
again cuz we're gonna add nail vitals
next I'm just using some plain striped
nail vinyls but if you want the best
selection for nail vinyls ever for
striped Chevron's really things whatever
I've always put a link below in the
video description box to where you can
get all my so what I'm doing right
now is kind of optional for the purposes
of
Unicorn veins on your nails I just
thought it would be cool to have a
black-and-white color block underneath
okay peel off the vinyls and oh my god
did you guys just see that it almost
took off my whole mani serves me right
for doing this and wearing a peel-off
base coat I guess whew that was a close
one
and I'm doing some other random black
and white color-block on my other nails
because by not you only live once so do
weird color blocks and also can we just
please pay attention and notice that the
creamy white is covering the black in
one coat oh my god this is so satisfying
guys look at that white however my
ability to press down nail vinyls was
not quite as satisfying back to the
veins yes I harvested all these unicorn
veins myself you're welcome
don't worry guys all the unicorns were
already dead and they all checked off
the little organ donor checkbox on their
death certificate things or whatever
health policy forms in the name of
science charlie in the name of science
okay no but really they call these laser
lace and I got them from this random
really cheap shop that I found online
and I put the link below to that there
is no link to unicorn organ harvesting
you'll have to contact me offline for
that next you're going to need some tiny
Russian scissors to cut up those unicorn
veins and just kind of eyeball it in
terms of cutting out a rectangle that
might fit your nail ooh I wonder what
unicorn eyeballs would be like on your
nails so you can start by rounding out
the edges around the cuticle and place
it over top of your nail to see if it
will kind of fit now in all honesty I
wasn't really sure exactly how to apply
these to the nail without all the little
fibers sticking out like a scarecrow
because I got the idea to go hunt down
these unicorn veins from this account on
Instagram but they didn't explain
anything about how they did it at all
and then I did some more research and
realized that they were a nail tech
working out of a nail shop so of course
they didn't want to tell us common folk
the unicorn secrets it all makes sense
now but hey I'm a nail art vigilante and
I'm gonna use the unicorn veins if I
want to so yeah what am i doing I'm
basically pressing the veins down into a
really thick and still wet coat of
glossy top coat
make sure to press down really gently
because you
Spray or shoot the talker everywhere
that would get kind of messy once you
feel like the unicorn veins are mostly
secured down into the nail and kind of
stuck there just go ahead and start
chopping off the loose fringes around
the nail with your tiny Russian scissors
I used a clean dry brush to brush away
some of the remnants and just go ahead
and keep forcing those veins into your
nail if you have to kind of help to use
a clear sheet of plastic once the
topcoat was mostly dry but still a
little squishy to then place it over top
of the whole nail and push down whoo-hoo
we got a flyaway men'she hair meow I
still needed to do some chopping around
the sides of the nail despite the fact
that these Russian scissors are supposed
to be tiny and precise personally I was
terrified when I was doing this because
I kept thinking I might accidentally
stab myself with the scissors I should
have probably just took Sveta out of the
closet from my previous kidnapping and
had her cut it but you know I was trying
to be nice she was taking a nap let's do
it again on my other nail the reason why
I did black and white underneath if
anyone was wondering what the hell I was
thinking when I did that was so I could
see what unicorn veins looked like over
black as well as over white and I've
decided they look kind of boring
overweight a little girly definitely not
badass and now we shall seal in the
veins to become one with the unicorn
pretty soon when you open your mouth you
will actually vomit rainbows like the
snapchat filter now here I'm just using
my new favorite click to our top coat
which also happens to be a super thick
nice and thick and juicy glossy top coat
but I did try a gel topcoat on my thumb
just to see if it would make a
difference and I still get a little bit
of bumpiness of the unicorn vein
sticking out so
didn't really make that much of a
difference oh my god we have not yet
discussed what's on my other hand it's a
beautiful black hollow but please excuse
the raunchy state of my nails and
cuticles it's been about a day since
I've changed this nail polish now let's
get back on track vain tracks hey calm
down
drug-addicted unicorns this bluish
greenish yellowish unicorn beans is
probably my favorite of the bunch of
Mane's I had to choose from here's a
look at the more yellow leaning veins
and here's the pinkish veins yeah I
didn't really like these ones so much
they're kind of boring but I had to
experiment with all the different color
veins I could find and over black and
white just so I can show you all the
magical possibilities I do notice that
the veins look better over white and in
direct light you ready for you ready for
it yeah look at that
see those vein tracks come out to play
at night hold on a second I'm sensing a
magnetic force my nails are suddenly
attracted to the unicorn skin the
unicorn skin wants to be one again with
the unicorn veins they want to be in the
same body well too bad cuz you're dead
and I'll decide what I do with your body
parts wow I must sound like a complete
sociopath and now it's that time where
we peel off our nails so we can save
them under our pillow I'm using my
favorite nail oil I put the link below
to help loosen the nail shelf and you
just take an orange stick or a wooden
stick or whatever kind of stick and
gently push it under and pop it right
off it's really satisfying you should
try it sometime by the way I did wear
these for at least 24 hours so they
didn't pop off for at least a day but
will it work with a gel polish top coat
oh my god it's working guys do you
realize what this means I'm gonna do a
video on that soon now bow down to the
unicorn vein shells bow down and thanks
so much for dissecting a dead unicorn
with me and I'll see y'all next time
