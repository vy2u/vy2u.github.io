glitter placement I did guys it only
took me like 18 years of my life but I
do it for you because I want you to see
the sparkle can all seriousness it took
me like five or six hours but it's
totally worth it
I started with a dark colored base coat
I think this was sash wonderfully witty
some navy blue I'm using five different
colors of hollow hex glitter from
twinkle tea
yes that's hollow glitter as its brain
Bowie use my coat simply for 10% off
your entire order of glitter and now
vinyls and everything else that twinkle
G has do it now because there's glitter
you are getting glittery look at all the
shiny objects woah glittery you are
getting sparkly snap out of it it's time
to get to work to place the loose
glitter on the nail we got to make it
sticky so we do that by using a clear
polish not a topcoat because the topcoat
will get too thick and dry too fast and
we just take some toothpicks mine or
cinnamon flavor because I like to lick
things better flavored and then you're
going to lick the tip of the toothpick
and I really don't think I need to show
you that on video and then that's how
you pick up the little piece of glitter
I like to start my glitter placements at
the bottom of my nail and then work my
way up to the top but I'm no expert
honestly this is only like the second
time I've ever done a glitter placement
and this is the first time that I ever
did a full mani all nails glitter
placement okay so you really should just
like probably not listen to my tips on
this one
because I'm sure there's other people
who have way better tips than I do so
when you finish a line I'm just going to
add another stripe line down the side
and then I'm going to keep building so
if you notice the hexes I'm trying to
position them so that they kind of
interlock to each other but they're not
completely touching or overlapping you
can really push them together as tight
as you want them to be I like to leave a
little space so I can read it or move it
around if I need to so the patterns that
I'm actually making it's supposed to be
a downward C shape so that's how you
kind of see like if you look at the pink
for example it's kind of going in one
direction
it's like slanted it's not straight
across the nail and then on the other
half the nail I'm gonna do it going the
same downwards direction will actually
upwards with an angle we're looking at
it but whatever you know what I mean the
design I was going for kind of reminds
me of those like friendship bracelets
that I used to make with a bunch of
knots in like grade 7 at like sleepover
camp those were the good old days but
now we do it with glitter on our nails
which is so much more fun why didn't I
do this when I was in grade 7 why the
sides are always a little tricky because
if you're like me and human our cuticles
are not hexagon shaped so you're going
to have to like move them around and
make it work
all right first half the nails done and
now we do the second half only 17 more
hours to go
all right now this is the tricky part
you see how at the bottom of my nail
there's still some blue space but an
entire hexagon glitter wouldn't fit I
take some what they call cuticle nippers
but I don't actually ever use these to
cut my cuticles do not cut your cuticles
they will look rugged like a xxx old man
and you don't want that so I just cut
the little hexagons in half and this is
definitely a difficult task meant for
tiny little leprechauns instead of
humans then I just kind of place them
where I can and after some point I'm
like oh I'm so tired of putting these
stupid little pieces up into pieces so
I'm done and I don't really care if it's
extra glue spaced around whatever but
there does that look pretty cool look at
how shiny it is you can kind of see that
it's a V and really turn out that much
of a teepee as I wanted but it's fine
I'll learn for next time add a really
thick coat of glossy top coat to seal it
all in in fact I added too I just didn't
film
make sure to seal the tip of the nail as
well and by adding two layers of topcoat
and selling the tip the little glitters
won't fall off you want this menu to
last and now it's your turn to go out in
the streets and wave your hands around
and cause car crashes
no I'm kidding please don't do that but
if you're like need to distract the
teacher from cheating order chest or
something you could try waving your
nails like that's probably fine because
no one will die this mani is so epic I
left it on for an entire week at work
and no one thought I was crazy at a
professional office environment nope not
at all alright thanks for watching don't
forget to go get your own loose glitter
from wwl-tv om and use my code simply
for 10% off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
