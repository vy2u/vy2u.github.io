to do our nails for back-to-school your
teachers will all be impressed
especially your high school teachers
when I have no idea what to do on my
nails yet I like to start with a white
base coat this is my favorite white
polish you can watch that video to see
more add a quick try top coat because I
still don't know what I'm doing next
back to school what is that about again
oh they're all so happy and cheery
apples I never gave my teacher one of
those oh that looks cool Browns
how original so I grab my collection of
crappy acrylic paint you could of course
just use nail polish but I'm a cheer and
use acrylic paint because it's a lot
easier to work with and you can scratch
it off if you mess up and this is what I
did on my nails first so my thinking was
to make the line curved up and down like
that picture so I just marked on my one
nail where the neck height of the next
crown should continue I'll just paint my
middle nail for you guys and take some
blue acrylic paint in a striping brush
and this is the hard part cuz you gotta
know how to freehand paint which as you
may recall I have not been so successful
at doing but there are a few tricks you
can use watch my pretend how to paint
video to find out more so I'm just
drawing these crowns on like
super massively and then putting a
little triangle thing at the tip
actually I don't know are these crowns
our coloring pencils doesn't really make
a difference because you never actually
use either of them in school anyways so
then I mark on my pointer finger where
the red should continue and then I
painted that nail and get yet added a
second coat of acrylic paint to make it
a little bit more opaque and that's the
first step to make it look like you have
a very poorly installed rainbow picket
fence we're going to add some dimension
to these coloring pencils slash crowns
with white and black acrylic paint now
this is where my knowledge of French
language is completely useless to me
because I can't even paint a tiny little
mark on a crown what was the point of
going to French immersion school for
twelve years if I couldn't even come out
of it knowing how to freehand paint
let's try and fix up those white blobs
with some black blobs oh my god this is
so embarrassing you can like see my
hands shaking so bad right now nail
artist yeah that's right well I mean
like you clicked on this video knowing
it wasn't tell topes okay so I don't
have anything thank you
trying to go back and fix your mistakes
it's hard that's what you learn when you
become an adult oh it's a yogurt lid of
rainbows I just need my little toothpick
trick as always to even have the cuticle
area add a topcoat to seal in that
painting job and disguise any uneven
messy areas because acrylic paint does
this weird absorption thing with topcoat
I don't know what like science or
something I always add a second glossy
top coat on top of the protein look at
that you're ready for school now you're
gonna get straight A's in art class but
oh my god what would me
there oh you know it's Hollow you guys
keep saying on all my videos but where's
the hollow and you know what like you
couldn't be more right clearly you have
been paying attention and simply in a
logical nail class 101 good job you all
get eggs for the recipe and cover that
up with a glossy top coat and your
school life just got better all the kids
in the school y'all don't be jealous of
you Yuda captain now of the volleyball
team oh look it's my face you can watch
my other back-to-school themed video
it's a vlog style of me reflecting on my
grade school projects suggested your
nails and now it's time to get your
knowledge and then you're ready to go
back to school
yeah all right guys have fun going back
to schools suckas bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
