today I'm gonna do what the actual fuck
recently I've done a lot of videos that
weren't really nail art videos and you
guys have noticed
does no one want to have any fun before
they die no but seriously I get it guys
and thank you for voicing your concerns
you'll want some nail art don't you and
I'm happy to hear that you even remember
or care about the fact that I did nail
art at all because honestly I'm not even
that good I mean there are millions of
other straight-up nail tutorials out
there on the internet some by amazingly
talented artistic people myself a little
less artistic but I try and keep you
entertained with other things like my
sense of humor
you
in any case let's do some actual nail
art today and don't forget to like this
video if you like watching me do nail
art I was working on a video that will
be coming up next that's not a Hitler
pic but in that video I was using these
test color bar screen thingies anyone
remember these anyone it's pretty much
the international symbol for something
is wrong with your television I thought
about doing the international symbol for
something is wrong with your YouTube but
that was really boring so I'm gonna
start off with a peel off base coat
because there will be people but
probably not in this video because I
won't have had time to wear it long
enough it can follow my snapchat for
some exclusive behind-the-scenes peel
porn though next we got to prepare some
straight line things using these
straight line nail vinyls you know it's
been a long time since doing a nail art
video when I don't even know how to
explain simple things anymore basically
I'm gonna make some decals for myself
and I'm using a piece of nail polish
that I peeled off from a design you
haven't seen yet to kind of figure out
how thick the middle stripe should be I
basically want to divide my nail into
three different sections so let's make
some white perfect stripe decals decals
whatever original hollow sexuals know
what I mean when I say things that don't
sound right let's make some yellow ones
too
by the way I'm using a special nail art
mat to make these on to put a link down
below for where you can find them if you
want one they're pretty handy now we're
gonna let all those dry and turn into
stickers
and I'm gonna paint all my nails with a
nice creamy white nail polish I ain't no
milk motherfucker
yes nostalgia swearing and nail art
sparing and Miller truth be told this
was a particularly challenging color
coordination design thing so I did plan
it out on a piece of paper before and I
used a shitload of different colors I
put the links for all of them down below
and it probably took me forever to do
that so you should check them out cuz I
did it since I made myself a white
stripe decal to go down the middle of my
middle nail I can loosely kind of
freehand paint the yellow on one side
and the blue on the other side and not
worry too much about whether or not the
line is straight in the middle because
I'm gonna cover it up with the white
decal afterwards now when your decals
are dry on your mat you can peel it up
with a very thin skinny metal tool thing
and it's really satisfying to peel it up
cut it so you get a nice straight edge
and I'm just applying some clear nail
polish down the middle so the decal has
something to stick to but oh shit guys
look it's what's on my other hand it
wouldn't be a simply analogical real
nail art video without this I'm wearing
a beautiful purplish blue linear hollow
that I've been wearing for eight or nine
days so that's why it looks like I've
been wearing it for eight or nine days
okay where were we oh yeah so just fold
the decal over the top of your nail cut
off the excess and you can use a cleanup
brush dipped in a little bit of acetone
to kind of melt it under your nail it
sounds bad but it's really totally fine
there's nothing wrong you're just
melting the nail polish not to your
actual nail next we're just gonna
freehand this perfectly straight pink
rectangle
ha no I'm a daddy Co for that too
obviously why anyone would bother
free-handing when you can just make
these stickers I don't know just cut
that up to size and add a little bit of
clear nail polish where it's supposed to
go and simply press it right on your
nail look at that geometric precision
I'm kind of for the black parts though
didn't really have much choice but to
freehand the black because it's curved
around the cuticle so it's really hard
to cut a square that's not a square you
know what I'm saying sure I suppose I
could have painted that whole bottom
section black and then put the pink over
top but the pink wouldn't have shown up
that well over black because the pink is
lighter than the black you know it's
like color science but I suppose there's
multiple different ways and order of
things that you could have done for
these nails to arrive at the same finish
look let me show you how I did it by
blocking the camera with my hand yep
yeah that's that's really helpful
Christine good job you're so good at
this when you're done you can add a nice
thick coat of glossy taco to seal
everything in and kind of level out the
playing field of colors and now we
interrupt this video to deliver an
important message from your internet
service provider Christine of the
YouTube channel simply no logical just
did an actual nail art tutorial Wow Wow
my mind is blown so while the glossy
taco looked cool I wanted to try it with
a matte taco that's matte top coat in
case you're new here because I felt like
it melded the colors together better I
don't know sometimes things look better
matte just sometimes very rarely for me
personally but this is one of those
I wanted to try it even though TV bars
aren't hollow my background is full of
hollow bar line things so that's there
to compensate and yeah I think that
looks pretty cool you can use this line
sticker decal technique to make any
combination of colors really it doesn't
have to be for a TV thing from a period
of time before you were born
wait a second yep that's a mangie hair
what's a nail art tutorial on my channel
without a mentee hair now things are
complete we can all go home now
wait no I lied no video is complete on
my channel without adding some Hollow oh
yeah girl let me see you sparkle I want
to see dumb rainbows a true hollow
sexual can resist adding a hollow taco
and a design that really didn't need it
and a final thick glossy taco because I
just want to make that Hollow shine baby
let me see you shine and that's it now
you don't care if your TV has a bad
signal error because you get to look at
the hollow alright guys thank you for
sticking with me through my dumbest
videos sometimes nail art or no nail art
I hope you guys enjoy my content because
I enjoy making it thanks so much for
watching and I'll see y'all
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
