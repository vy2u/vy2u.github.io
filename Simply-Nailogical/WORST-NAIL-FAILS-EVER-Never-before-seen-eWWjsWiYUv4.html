but I lied
well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again and I had a lot of fun roasting
your nails recently but then it occurred
to me that maybe a lot of you think I'm
amazing or some shit at nails but you
know what youtubers aren't always as
perfect as they appear on camera I was
doing some spring cleaning and found a
few nail fail skeletons in my hard drive
and I think it's finally time to show
you so here in six of my never before
published nail fails because I just
thought they looked ugly pretty much it
first up a powder chrome tail right when
this powdery chrome shit hit the market
I was feeling ambitious and thought what
if I use nail vinyls to make chrome
stickers that I could just stick on my
nail so I laid some vinyls down on a
silicon nail mat added some glassy gel
taco filled the vinyls up before I cured
it then cured that shit for a minute to
make it hard and yes
it looks like nothing is there then I
dipped a little sponge applicator in
some silver chrome and busted on top of
my DIY chevron shape at this point I
thought I was a genius I mean holy shit
that could be really cool right imagine
all the possibilities except yeah it
kind of looks a little see-through and
then I stuck it on my nail and it looks
like this turns out gel is really hard
to make layers stickers like this with
and as soon as I brushed a taco over top
of it all DaSilva just went everywhere
good idea bad execution
next up rewind to December 2015 a time
long before a Polish Mountain were you
there I had seen a few rainbow scratch
art videos on YouTube and I was inspired
to see if I could make it work on my
nail so did a bunch of different
backgrounds on my nails for the face I
first tried coating the colorful nail
with black India ink and that's
apparently what some of the scratch
artists use and they say work best but
it stained my fucking skin acetone would
not get it all unfortunately I don't
have a video clip of this but it stained
my pinky nail as well for like months it
had to grow
even wanted ride it was not scratching
so I had to bail that shit off then I
tried some black tempera paint and it
was just ripping up everything under it
and yes it had dried for like an hour
and then I tried black acrylic paint all
the experts in the scratch our domain
said that acrylic paint was the worst
for this because doesn't really scratch
off that well and the lines aren't so
clean but it was kind of working
unfortunately I just couldn't make any
discernible patterns or pictures and
then appealed it out I tried so hard to
get this to work and I was able to draw
this on my thumb I don't know what it is
anyways I gave up next up back in
September I was looking fly with silver
hollow on my nails and I thought I'm
going to do a really cute but edgy cat
manicure in my head I was thinking what
if I took black acrylic paint diluted it
with a bunch of water so that you kind
of get that smoky effect so that when
you fill in the holes in a nail vinyl
stencil the most concentrated part of
the black acrylic and water mixture
would stick around the outer edges so
the outlines of the cat heads and you
get this like cool outlined cat head
effect I thought of this after I did the
same technique with acrylic and water
for these mermaid nails it created this
cool outline and so I wanted evil smokey
black cats on my new I peeled it up and
it just looks like the kitty cats got
washed out
damn I tried so then I tried it again
this time with a thicker concentration
with more black acrylic to water I don't
know what I was singing because it kind
of just looks like I've smothered one of
those black mask's on my nails and yeah
you couldn't even tell that they were
cats so I peeled it off and moved on and
ended up doing these black and pink
gradient cat heads instead that I really
like and so you guys may have seen that
these ones did go on my channel next up
we got a really good example of Kristine
trying to be sexy and failing bloom
Foley wanted it to look like a sexy
sheer nude underneath of a mermaid
pattern so first I made my nails milky I
know like who does this milky-white
bullshit polish and then I added some
black sheer polish and it just looked
dirty but I carried on because sometimes
you guys see the whole idea through too
under side it looks like shit put on
some liquid latex slapped some mermaid
vinyls on and added a little slit down
the middle that's supposed to be the
sexy part and then took some beautiful
multi chrome flaky polish and sponge
that shit on yeah damn damn peels it off
and I I was very underwhelmed to say the
least what is this shit Kristine you
could do better than this I thought well
maybe if I add some sexy fine line we
can recover from this
fishnet maybe that's sexy right then I
added a glossy taco because I was
actually trying to convince myself that
this looks good and then fun fact I took
that off and then did these nails which
were a slightly less ugly version of the
previous one because the base has hollow
in it obviously and these ones did end
up on my channel see kids sometimes it's
okay to make things that look like shit
because the next time you do it it'll
probably look a little less shitty April
2015 Wow look at this historical
mythical ancient creature I was in an
ikat design mood because I just done
these ones and I thought they looked
pretty cool so I wanted to try a
different ikat pattern and use different
colors I've said before that ikat is a
great design choice for people who can't
draw for shit because like dry brushing
it's an excuse to just scribble
everywhere I don't know if it was the
poor choice of types of Polish or it was
just getting way too thick but it
started to get all sorts of gloppy on me
I was just looking more like a sludgy
cholesterol --is-- rather than very
crisp and sharp ikat design I'll be
honest I don't think this is one of the
worst to male fails I mean it's not that
bad I don't need to use the false sense
of modesty to fish for compliments it's
not bad it's just it was in my paper and
I liked the other ikat design it already
posted better so this one just seems
kind of shitty in comparison for some
reason I also took pictures of it I made
a thumbnail before deciding I didn't
want to post it and finally the last
nail fail I found for you is from May
2015 and oh it's one for the ugly books
back in the day when I did some swatches
for indie brands I used to do swatches
with the twist
in other words having an accent nail
with some kind of design using all the
colors in that particular collection and
this was for one of fun lacquers
collection full of multi-crew
glitter polishes if you're from the
simply snap squads and you would
recognize that I wore one of these
recently the polish was beautiful I was
using hollow striping tape
I was dabbing with a sponge all the
ingredients for an amazing nail art were
there I was trying to go for a stained
glass window look but then I felt like
the windows were not so clearly defined
so I decided to define them with a tiny
brush and white acrylic paint oh boy and
I misspelled in front of the entire
school the word failure why did I think
I could paint such tiny lines I don't
know then I added a glossy taco of
denial then immediately pulled my
fingers away from the camera because I
realized what the fuck is this Christine
I took all these pictures anyways
otherwise I wouldn't have had swatches
of this collection but none of these
photos saw the light of day these are
like embarrassing nudes to me and now
I've leaked them myself and there you
have it some of my nail fails that I've
never published before because I just
thought it looks an ugly I just want to
say that everyone has their own opinion
of what they don't like of their own
work and we are always our harshest
critics and I don't think all of these
nails are necessarily the worst nail
fails ever but hey I'm just trying to
fit in with the dramatic youtuber
techniques okay give me a break I know I
haven't posted that many nail art videos
recently and yeah one of the bigger
reasons is because I broke my nail and
it was just not in any condition to be
painted upon but at the same time I've
been having a lot of fun making
different types of videos for you guys
and I just want to say that I really
appreciate that you guys love whatever I
make whether it's nails makeup or some
random shit well yes I love nail art I
also really enjoy making funny videos
that make people laugh just call me
simply whatever the psychological
alright guys hope you enjoyed my fails
if you happen to have a nail fail soon
then you can just come back to this
video so you can feel better about
yourself thanks so much for watching and
I'll see y'all later bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
