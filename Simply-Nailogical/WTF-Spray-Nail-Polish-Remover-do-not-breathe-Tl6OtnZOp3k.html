removing your nail polish are you tired
of getting nail polish up your entire
hand are you still using nail polish
remover in a bottle and spilling it
absolutely everywhere
then stop use acetone spray to save the
day
simply spray towards your nails and get
it everywhere
amazing yes warning highly flammable
external use only keep out of reach of
children vapors making out your not use
while smoking intentionally suits by
deliberately concentrating inhaling the
conex can be harmful or fatal
didn't you know I'm a troll channel now
well hello everyone it's me christine
again what's that on my chest it's minty
probably should have worn another color
because I've already worn this purple
one
since the purple one is my favorite and
I do whatever that's okay one
call-to-action go buy my cat shirts
right meow all right what is this video
but recently I've seen a lot of you guys
tweet at me about this brand new Prada
spray nail polish remover you say I
couldn't find it in stores or get a chip
to Canada online so I had a friend from
America buy them for me and shipped them
to me was that legal
I won't tell but then I got this in my
p.o box from the company let's see if
they're gonna regret that one but I have
five of these things spray things so I
hope it works
wow this matches my outfit so nicely it
just so happens that both of my hands
have regular nail polish on in other
words I'm not wearing a peel off base
coat like I usually do I'm sorry guys no
peel porn in this video so this is an
excellent opportunity to test these out
because I need to take off these
starbucks Frappuccino the smarter way to
remove now
why the fuck is there a pair on this one
second spray away one second day I spent
longer reading this bottle first and
only maybe there's a reason for that
how do you know you'll always be the
only one then Ben is that mighty drink
huh
man one second spray away is the fastest
and most effective way to remove all
types of Polish in seconds without the
mess Wow so if I'm supposed to spray
this on my nails doesn't that just get
everywhere it would get on your hands on
your desk on my mochi shirt in the
fucking air but what would my youtube
channel be without stupid things to do
on camera right okay maybe I should read
the actual directions how about they
spray on cotton ball or pad until
saturated what you don't actually spray
this on your nails why did I think that
what why did I think that pressed cotton
ball over nail and swipe it from cuticle
to tip so that's the exact same thing
you do with regular nail polish remover
if not in this fridge I guess maybe this
is for people who knock over their
acetone you know all the time it's such
a problem really all right Christine
shut up in a try it
cotton balls I might add it's like bug
spray oh I just wanted to smell it
okay I can't when all over my and I'm
trying to be very specific care but I
got how about if we just suffocate it
huh the fuck oh my god it stings I have
eczema ah I didn't even do anything
I just wanted to spray it with my nail
polish are there directions on how far
away from the cotton pad you're supposed
to be no how do i spray though all right
let's see if I can drown you okay it's
it's wet so I guess that works but
you're gonna need a paper towel under
your cotton pads yes you want to
refinish shell your furniture okay so
maybe I don't fully understand how to
use this but it's not like you came here
for a real meaningful review did you if
you did you're on the wrong Channel my
friend subscribe all right so let's take
our cotton soaked cotton soaked I'm
already high acetone so cotton ball I'm
gonna do what they say which is press
over now and swipe from cuticle to tip
so I'm pressing down this is pretty much
how I normally remove my nail polish
then you just pull away oh yeah these
nails have about six or seven coats of
nail polish on them so it might take a
little longer than usual to take off
let's see how this shit works on nail
polish with a normal amount of coats
maybe is just better not to breathe
while doing this just a suggestion to
improve your experience and pressing
firmly okay yeah that doesn't it doesn't
remove it in one second does it alright
we're naked fuck I thought I thought
that was mighty perfect I'm kind of
curious what would happen if I just
actually sprayed my name before I do
this so we gotta take some cautionary
measures and I would be loading up my
fingers and nails with nail oil so that
my fingers don't turn all crusty I made
this nail oil pen myself eventually I'm
gonna have a video on how to grow your
nails but for now you get to watch these
great video this is a terrible idea so
as expected my nails are now swimming in
a pool of acetone and the cotton pad
obviously wouldn't have any nail polish
remover on it yet
dude damn I was really hoping that
that's what this was supposed to be for
disappointed let's try this again but on
a cotton pad oh my god it made my nails
the color the bottle I'm just kidding my
nails are naturally candy corn sexy
since this video isn't really fun
anymore
why don't we compare this to regular
acetone based nail polish remover and
see if there's actually a difference I
don't really have a preference about
nail polish remover but I do like
acetone based because it just works
better let's be honest I mean acetone
isn't gonna kill you right
let it on fire it beside yourself but
one thing you can do to help stop it
from drying is add a shitload of nail
oil on your nails before you take off
your nail polish you can also put some
nail straight into the acetone nail
polish remover so how I would normally
take off my nail polish is go like this
set to about one second press the
acetone soaked cotton thingy on my nail
or like I don't know ten seconds 30
seconds but you wouldn't want to reuse
that same part of the cotton pad so you
just flip it around and do the same
thing and that's how I take off my nail
polish if I didn't peel it off oh my god
like I'm actually giving you guys advice
and that's pretty what happened wait a
second
this one says do not breathe in vapors
and this one makes you breathe in vapor
don't like this let's give these two a
head-to-head test on my other hand oh
wait a second what's on my other hand
it's a beautiful blue a faint hollow
polish with a slutty little pinky that
guy's naked too early the reason why you
should hold the cotton pad down for a
bit instead of mushing it around like
this so you can avoid getting the Polish
all up in your skin and standing your
skin this happened to my sister once
last time I ever come to surprise do it
then you just kind of push it away from
the nail look it's like a nail swatch
now let's remove my middle finger never
alright so same thing here
press it down contemplate the meaning of
life subscribe to my channel just do
something with your time and we're just
gonna push I mean maybe I didn't hold it
down quite as long as I did on the other
now I don't know okay it's really hard
to replicate the exact same conditions
with all of these extraneous variables
maybe we should ask the nail art water
marbling science kit for help now
is a science in my opinion I did not see
any real or meaningful difference in
efficiency of removal and this certainly
took more than one second but I mean hey
maybe you're clumsy as fuck and you just
knock your acetone over every day I
found the product for you well what am i
I have too many in conclusion I feel
like this is an invention we never
needed this is simply not logical and
now I'm desperately in need of hollow
maybe this is easier for children to
take off nail polish because children
spill things all the time right keep out
of reach of children
damn this product may be of interest you
if you're an arsonist could make things
easier just you know spray a little here
spray a little bad spray a little by
your boss's house and then go to your
ex's house and a lighter on fire Kim
genius why didn't I think of that I
should have done that for the intro
obviously I'm joking right you all know
this sometimes I don't even know when
I'm joking alright everybody thanks so
much for watching and I'll see y'all
later but I'm just kidding I would never
do that to you guys or my camera all
right mom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
