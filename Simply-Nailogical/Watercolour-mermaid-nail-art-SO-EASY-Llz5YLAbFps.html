you'll just have to look at my hands and
pretend my face is talking to you I was
inspired by life his nails on Instagram
to try out this new watercolor technique
and obviously it incorporated vinyls so
I was instantly attracted to it I went
for a mermaid themed mani and I used a
bunch of different acrylic paint to get
the watercolor effect plus a white base
coat and some magical glitter Stoppers
that I'll show you soon enough I start
out with a white base coat what else is
new you must be really bored of hearing
me repeat this if you watch all my
videos but if you don't watch my videos
you can watch my video on what's the
best white polish in the left hand
corner then I add a quick try top coat
and let dry for about 15 to 20 minutes
because we're going to use nail vinyls
next then I add some simply peel liquid
latex barrier which will help me clean
up the acrylic disgusting mess that will
end up or out my nails I put the link
for simply peel down below in the video
description box I you simply peel so
much that I'm almost out of my 15
milliliter bottle good thing I have this
massive refill bottle of simply peel did
you guys want to see a video on how to
refill your simply peel sounds like the
simplest video ever to exist but you
never know that's what YouTube is for
right showing everyone how to do so
in life and I will make one if you
comment below that you want to see a
simply deal refill video simply peel
only takes about 2 to 3 minutes to dry
then you're going to take your
mermaidman bottles from twinkle tea calm
and you can use my code simply to get
10% off my code is the best code it gets
you special powers so you better use it
if you want to be a hollow unicorn
barmaid how they feel laughs oh nice I'm
so excited to use these I haven't used
mermaid vinyls before what is wrong with
me so I just cut the sides of the vinyl
because it helps with pressing the vinyl
evenly down on the nail because my nail
unlike some other people out there is
quite curved so I kind of need to like
push it around the sides of the nail
then I just trimmed off some of the top
because it's like kind of dragging the
vinyl down you know what I'm saying you
know and I threw a bunch of blobs of
different colors of acrylic paint I
picked up from my local craft store on a
girl it'd so just take a random craft or
a paint brush dip it in the acrylic
paint again start with blue and dab it
randomly over the vinyl yes it's that
easy just laying around
whatever wipe it off in the paper towel
then I take a different slightly wider
brush and I soak it in water and then
kind of drain out the water and then
start to pick up the blobs of wet paint
from my nail honestly I did not know
what I would do any when I first tried
this technique which was for this video
but I found it to be more of a trial and
error process and by that I mean
sometimes I added more water sometimes I
added less sometimes I had bigger blobs
of paint except that I did not so thick
globs of paint and then you kind of just
keep playing around until it looks like
something that makes sense let's try it
another color here's some purple looks
pretty evil I don't know what happened
to it
it was cursed so this time I'm trying
the acrylic paint mixed with water
already and then instead of completely
dragging my second brush I leave it a
little bit wet so you can see actually
leaving it wet kind of gives you a
little more watercolor look like watery
watercolor should look like watercolor
because it's called watercolor I thought
it could use some more pinkish color so
I mix them red and purple and add it in
some more spots
much like the dry brushing tick
a watercolor technique is one of those
kinds of art where you can make a
complete mess of your canvas and say
that you intended it to look that way
and let's add a little bit of aqua blue
because I'm one of those people who
don't know when to quit one thing that I
did realize using this watercolor
technique is that if you're using nail
vinyls it's important to make sure that
you see this kind of cooling effect of
the acrylic paint around the outlines of
the vinyl shapes this is what's going to
give you a sweet-looking
outline effect you'll see next when I
take off the vinyl if you don't see the
paint pooling around the edges of the
insides of the vinyl pattern and just
keep adding some more paint around the
edges until you do when you think you're
about done clean off your brush and look
at that pretty are you just made you
just made it by accident on a paper
towel now you're gonna reveal your
second piece of artwork for the day by
removing the nail vinyl take a pair of
tweezers and lift up the vinyl from each
corner so you don't get any smearing
going on even if it doesn't look like
there's a big mess of paint on the
simply peeled latex barrier it was
definitely important to have it air
because watered-down acrylic paint can
create a huge leaky mess into your
cuticles paint leaked a bit under the
vinyl use a toothpick to erase all your
mistakes that's a little clip from my
latest video on how to pretend to paint
but it's definitely a valuable trick and
there's no sarcasm intended here
seriously though look at this I just
pick a toothpick and just scratch off
the acrylic paint and this only works
because I'm a using acrylic paint and be
because I added a quick dry top coat
over top of the nail polish base
sometimes this kind of leakage is
inevitable but with the toothpick trick
it's like whatever dude I got it covered
now how freaking cool is that I'm like a
glowing Merman at a fashion party
want to see how to not make these nails
look good do what I did on my pinky all
my other nails are like you can't sit
with us
so remember when I told you that that
outline part would teach making this
look good yeah so that's what I
apparently did wrong on my pinky I
didn't leave the acrylic paint on long
enough and I didn't put on enough so it
wasn't pooling around the outlines of
the inside of the edges of the vinyl now
in true mermaid spirit guess what I put
on this mani I'm just kidding I didn't
put on hollow even though I put all of
on everything instead I tried out
something different this is enchanted
polishes ice castle micro shimmer pink
to purple to blue shifting iridescent
unicorn dandruff okay I don't know all
these terms
I'm a terrible nail blogger don't listen
to anything I say all you need to know
is that this shimmery glittery top coat
is pretty and you should put it on your
nails on top of your watercolor mermaid
add a glossy top coat to bring out that
magical mystery shimmer and bam you're a
mermaid you're officially the firstborn
of the unicorn mermaid species that's
all for today I don't know about you but
man she is totally loving this
watercolor technique thanks so much for
