out my nails my nails high school on
them it's that time where you wish
summer was a season that lasted all year
the best school you've ever been to is
the one on this channel this channel
right here where you learn everything
including nothing I invited a special
guest today watch me sit watch me Naenae
hi guys so today I have my charming
Canadian cute collegiately friend beside
me what I don't know why I'm here
his name is Benjamin and he's a prince
what are we doing this isn't a nail art
tutorial there will be another video
that has these back-to-school nails
because everyone's going back to school
soon so you got to do your nails for
school what's your advice for the kids
of YouTube for going back to school
what's your best advice for them you
don't have any advice oh I went to
school once it was awful so proud of my
master's degree that I didn't even put
it in a frame okay it's it like the
original packaging my nail polish
belongs on a wall more than my master's
degree forget this shit that means you
can call me master simply no logical so
today we thought it would be funny to
look at some of my old school projects
alright then pass the briefcase you can
keep this so I'm a huge loser and I
hoard everything oh my god it's so heavy
1998 - nothing to blank it doesn't know
where it ends it's an accordion fans
gonna hold this cause it's heavy he
comes in real handy sometimes
first there the box my healthy living
portfolio alright so I have some topic
list here I'll read them off to you what
is breast cancer keep dope out of the
games booth banded dots till June what
happens after June nothing mattered but
shooting up sounds like a great piece of
work I've put together
the class was this way I don't know the
guys I'm in school but Miller is in crap
cooter this exercises like you had to
write about health concerns um
so instead of doing that I printed this
off yahoo.com do you write any of this
this article I cut out of magazine
rape situation going on right here you
got a mark on this I don't understand I
don't know I just have check marks
everywhere didn't write any of this that
whatever
okay next back in the day when the
internet was really new and fascinating
that we could find information all we
did was just print off sheets and sheets
of stuff and just attach it to the back
of our projects and say source the
Internet
gonna leave a little MLG oh yeah by the
way I went to French immersion from
grade 1 to grade 12 so that means I
speak French made passing it I think I
was in high school when I did this even
though it looks like something you would
do when you're in grade school Cooper's
glitter on it changed my market and they
clearly had a 95% and he scratched it
off to a 93 what's wrong with you
teacher
hater what dilute translation whoa oil
before Instagram these were captions
when I was in school I was like reading
books and learning Canadian history all
your stuffs about drugs and pictures of
pictures you took off the internet
smack which is a street name for heroin
it's this more about drugs yes I think
for this project like I had to read a
book and then write about it and I wrote
about it on cool paper though so that's
cool reading isn't just for reading
words okay reading is for looking at the
page so you either wanted to have
glitter or something cool in the
background or for just to be pictures
remember that kids pictures are worth a
thousand words and that means that
videos are worth a million words so you
don't gotta read a book today please
read
what is this very conspicuous older guys
DDR anyone remember those we have Linkin
Park and 5th maked two cards
that's good thing to have when you do
presentations kids and you must tie them
together in a pink hair band
I will especially help your performance
is printed off stuff I'm so hot right
now
shouldn't there just be recipes on these
what's the recipe look I wrote a
newspaper article it never got published

that my use of crack is out of control
when I'm high on drugs I forget all my
problems in school is unimportant can
you help me sincerely
desperate dear desperate you are
addicted to crack
thanks Tom I guess both addicts do not
realize they are addicted until a doctor
tells them so and sends them to a rehab
center wise words from simply illogical
how many teens are doing
I don't know is there a crack problem I
don't think I ever knew one person who
did crack I just imagined that I did
people in the ads you see in magazines
doing drugs may seem cool but really
they're paid to do what they do in order
to sell the drugs next time your friends
are smoking crack and they offer you
some next time there's always the next
time keep a copy of this letter in your
pocket and everytime they offer you
sound pull it out and
read it over stop texting pay attention

depression is very deep and last four
