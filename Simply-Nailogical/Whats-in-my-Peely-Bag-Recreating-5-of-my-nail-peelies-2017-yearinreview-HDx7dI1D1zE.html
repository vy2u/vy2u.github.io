do the murder and you got to keep a
piece of it to remember your
accomplishments trophies this is normal
behavior
well hallo everyone it's me Christine
again and if you're new here
meet my PE bag in it you will find many
different nail art and nail polish
pieces that I peeled off my nails a
growing collection I consider it more
like art in progress or the long time
holo sexuals out there you will have
seen my Kili bag make appearances here
and there in my videos it's been three
years and Counting and then you get to
add your peel off-- manicures into your
collection of a bunch peel off manicures
now it's that time again when we've
killed off our nails we're gonna add
them to the pili bag but aside from that
I've never really shown what's in my
pili bag I've seen so many requests for
a what's in my bag video or a tour of my
pili bag niche in my bag it's not a
beauty blender or a card shape bracelet
it's fun LP Li's I figured with 2017
coming to an end thank God now would be
the perfect time to go through my Kili
bag together and reflect on what I wore
on my nails this year
Wow I did a lot of nail art this year no
I didn't so the first question I think
people out there may wonder is why why
the hell do you keep these P Li's you
fucking weirdo you see I have a problem
with collecting things sweatpants
nail polish lots and lots of teeth but
the nail POA specifically are like
trophies to me I spend a lot of time and
do a lot of hard work and they do not
deserve to be thrown away the other
question I think some new people to my
videos may ask oh by the way hi welcome
please stay
it's how the hell did you even peel your
nails off like what does that mean and
are you psychotic yes the answer is yes
years ago I discovered what is called a
peel-off basement which applies just
like a regular clear nail polish base
coat after which you paint your nails or
do your nail art as you normally would
and then a couple days later when you
feel like taking your nail polish off
instead of removing it the usual way by
rubbing your nails with nail polish
remover all you have to do is lift up
the nail polish pili which has now
hardened into a shell and pop it right
off now mind you some pills are better
than others and that can depend on a
number of factors including how many
coats of nail polish you put on what
kind of topcoat you used and so on and
so on all of these things are very
important to ensuring a satisfying peel
porn experience
speaking of peel porn if you're also
wondering what the fuck I'm talking
about that is something I started doing
many years ago as a young adult posting
it to the Internet and one of my feature
peel porn videos was just so damn hot
that YouTube demonetized it because
advertisers did not think it was
friendly you can go back to bed earmuffs
maybe you want to help me pick up Ely
how many of you guys have suggested that
you want me to randomly draw from a
Healy bag and try and recreate the
design on my nails and I think the
people making that suggestion are very
well aware that there's some complicated
ass shit in this bag I've just come to
the conclusion that you guys like to see
me suffer so grab your tea and let's
play pick that Healy
okay I'm closing my eyes and I'm gonna
pick random pili Betty Betty I want to
pick a fold one not a little crusty one
oh that's just plain blue Hollow okay
we're not gonna do that one okay let's
draw again ready
I love this nice big one oh god what am
I done
I remember this pili this is a cyclone
reciprocal gradient pan looks like an
optical illusion gradient and you're not
really sure how the hell I did it or in
what order
okay here we go to the nail polish
there's one there's another I believe it
was just these polishes but let me
double-check and right now I am very
happy that I spend about an hour making
sure my description boxes are very
complete with all the stuff that I used
because now I can confirm that these are
in fact the exact nail polishes that I
used to make this guy now we need now
vinyls where do I keep my nail vinyls
these we're just gonna paint on a fresh
coat of this aqua creme messy what are
you doing
first we got a protector skin with some
liquid latex does anyone remember the
days before liquid latex we had to use
tape or acetone and q-tips
haha paint the polish vertically on a
makeup sponge and now we gonna dab dab
dab like sweaty let's peel off the
liquid latex and now we're gonna add a
nice thick coat of glossy choco because
we're gonna add nail vinyl the next
memories the sculpture how I missed you
cat clock cuz we gotta let the glossy
taco drive really well before putting
the old vinyls on how about we pick our
next pili bring me the bag ready the
Dolan twins no we're gonna pick again
rainbow holo oh yeah sometimes you can
tell the age of a pili by how tightly
it's curled it's like you got to flatten
it it on your neck oh I popped Abby Lee
and let's take a trip down pili lane for
a second and reminisce these were one of
my first nail art tutorials that went
viral all you need is some silver hollow
glitter polish and some highlighters
been on one thin coat of the silver
hollow glitter first and then you know
the drill we're gonna dab dab dab to
maximize glitter opacity one of the
oldest tricks in the books okay we've
got my peel here for reference so if I
recall correctly all you got to do is
take your highlighters and color right
over top of the Hollywood
why is this turning out so much shittier
no cab may oh damn it fairy I'm Ferris
the conspiracy theories are true
something illogical really died last
year and was replaced by someone who
can't do their nails hi
nice to meet you I'm Melissa I couldn't
take it off and start over again and
probably get it right the second time
but I don't think that would be fair for
the purposes of this challenge the point
was to see if I could recreate it the
first time not give me multiple attempts
because after all you only have one life
in this game called life and if you use
it you die I am a very optimistic person
okay so we're just gonna add a glass of
choco on this and you know call it a day
now let's go back to my unfinished
reciprocal Cyclone gradient now first
we're gonna add some liquid latex oh
good you left the line again just press
it down gently
but wait do you see what's on my other
hand it's a tradition this channel just
can't give up whether I'm making a nail
video or not I always want to show you
what's on my other hand and today we
have a insert the blank here
hollow polish and it's so beautiful okay
anyways now we're gonna take our sponge
from our first gradient and we're gonna
cut this sponge oh yeah so sighs fine
save the sponges
yeah okay let's peel ready oh my god the
lines aren't super perfect and crisp but
it's still pretty damn good guess I
still got it now the one thing missing
to make it exactly the same is to add a
hollow taco oh she's back okay one fail
one success what's next let's ask the
pili bag oh now that is a classic I
think this is one of the first few
videos I ever showed my face in Wow
that's a throwback look it fits so
perfectly I'll just put it back on
alright which color was first where's my
reference material oh there it is so you
just kind of gently Pat down a barely
wet brush and I had definitely added a
hollow taco and she passed me the hollow
taco thank you
now you know it wasn't just a phase mmm
Here I am two and a half years later
still adding a hollow taco to everything
well we let that dry let's pick another
pili Benji you want to pick this one
okay she's sick of my shit so oh I
remember this guy this was a dotty care
that ended up looking like one of those
colour blind tests she okay I can do
this one oh shit I need striping tape
Mitchie it's been so long paint on a
white base add a quick dry glossy taco
and while we let that dry we're gonna go
back to the pointer now this is a lot of
back and forth and paint on our black
acrylic does that
that one to close so no no undo luckily
thanks to the toothpick trick we can
essentially undo it it has saved my life
many times okay how did I do it's very
good it's just you know slightly on a
bigger scale than the original now I
just add a nice thick coat of glassy
deco let's revisit the thumb so for this
one you're gonna need some striping tape
oh the good old days
finding the goddamn end of the fucking
striping tape again find it somewhat
ugly you basically got to make the
striping tape look like a braid I'm
really struggling with doing this so far
ahead of my face so I'm just gonna do it
like this I mean if you really want a
tutorial there is already a tutorial on
my channel if you can find it oh God
all the nail polish is little crusty now
we add a nice thick coat blast attack oh
and I totally used the wrong orange
didn't I yes I did
so much for looking in your detailed
description boxes Christine all right
now it's time for the final pili draw
and what'll it be
Miki feely what'll it be you see as
beautiful as it is this glitter
placement took me about six or seven
hours
you know what Oh would you look at that
it's the perfect fit I think in order to
preserve my sand beach we're just gonna
stick this beauty right back on the nail
of course we got to use a peel off base
coat so I can peel off the peel and then
all you gotta do is just drop it on if
I'd actually tried to redo it it would
not look this good so and all right I
think we're all done here
we have successfully recreated with a
little bit of cheating 5 historical nail
pili artifacts from the simply illogical
channel and these were just 5 of what
has to be several hundreds of peonies
how about we do a little abridged tour
for the please that didn't get the
spotlight today oh oh I'm gonna pick up
this one if you think that's my cat
Harry yes you are correct it is these
were my men she mustache nails and they
were a hit right minty right that's
right yeah
oh that's cool scaled gradient mm-hmm
those were the days
look I even saved this it says one plus
one equals wind oh that's pretty
oh yes these were my oil slick foil
nails I'm not that shit look it's an old
shriveled up Donald Trump a secret
security service please do not come
after me and how could we forget my two
trips to polish Mountain it's so crazy
how much these Shrunk my nails were
definitely not this small they just
shriveled up over time they look like
little colorful raisins
that's kind of creepy it's not what our
bodies do after we die I also saved the
P Lee's and the little pieces of real
gold nail polish from that time Sophia
and I went to the luxury nail salon and
of course we got my most recent pili mr.
snow globe
as I reflect on the past year of this
channel I think about how very early in
the year I had a very tragic nail break
it was death dating and as a result of
that while my nail was healing I did a
bunch of other random kinds of videos
pretty much anything but nail art but
then my nail healed and I found myself
honestly wanting to continue doing more
fun and more involved videos with my
face in front of the camera instead of
just kind of sitting there in the dark
painting my nails and adding a voiceover
later I was having too much fun and I
just wanted to keep having fun
it's the jenna Marbles model okay it's
where you do whatever the fuck you want
my channel just morphed into Jenna's
selfish time where I do put up who's
gonna make me laugh because it makes you
laugh and luckily as it turns out a lot
of you guys were also laughing along
with me maybe add me either way and now
I would like to turn into a sock and say
a big mushy thank you to all of you
who've enjoyed my videos over here on
simply anything but nail art logical I
really do appreciate you guys sticking
around and still loving and enjoying my
videos even though I've completely
departed from what I started this
channel is getting nervous hives not
good at the shit I hate mushi shit I'm
just a sock I've just been really happy
and enjoying you know making more fun
and interactive content and taking
suggestions from you guys and doing
little skits outside and whatnot if
having been joined me and drinking tea
on my second channel mentors in the
background it's been fun and I see all
your guys's comments and tweets and
memes of me and you make me laugh too
but let's all remember that
I'm thankful for you guys making me
laugh because as my channel art that I
have not changed over three years says
you gotta have some fun before you die
aunty what do you think she's not
impressed
could you do magic eye nails like you
have to look at the nail a certain way
to see like the image of a cat chasing a
mouse or something
I'm retired - to 2018 it's gonna be a
good year of what on this channel I
