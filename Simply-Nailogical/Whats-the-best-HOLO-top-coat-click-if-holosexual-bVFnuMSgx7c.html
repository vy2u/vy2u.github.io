get it
hallo hallo and today we will be doing
one of the most top requested
experiments on this channel ever what's
the best holo topcoat let me just
preface this by saying that this is a
very tricky experiment because it's not
one of those things where one specimen
is clearly better than the other much of
it is up to personal preference in other
words how much holo do you watch on your
nails or what kind of holo effect do you
want the other thing is that I will only
be testing 11 different holo top coats
I've acquired over the past year or so
therefore I don't have every single holo
top coat in the world
Cheerilee some people think that this
video series is unfair because I don't
test every single product out there like
seriously what do you think I am someone
on hoarders buried alive obviously I
don't have every single holo topcoat out
there but just to be clear this video is
about what my opinions are of the eleven
that I will show you here today thought
that was clear but I guess I gotta spell
it out for some people before we begin
if you don't know what a holo is there's
another video for you that explains the
difference between hollows and other
shiny nail polishes and if you don't
know what a nail polish is I'm not sure
why you're here but you've definitely
found the weird part of the Internet
we're glad to have you in my what -
Hollow / are you hollow sexual video I
mentioned how there's two main kinds of
hollow linear hollow
and scattered hollow for today's video
I'm going to pick my favorite hollow
topcoat from each screw because they
truly have different effects on the nail
and it all depends what kind of hollow
sexual look you're going for as always I
will link all the contenders in the
video description box but I'll also
point out which top coats are indeed
meaning made by smaller nail polish
companies and which ones are drugstore
brands I did get some of those I know
wow it's a miracle first off no nail
experiment could be completed without my
trusty peel-off base coat
yellow nails taste so good without it I
wouldn't be able to do this nope no I
wouldn't I would suffer a lot more than
my nails have during my experiments next
I'm adding one coat of my favorite black
polish from my what's the best drugstore
black polish video because hollow top
coats are best seen over black fun fact
let's start off with linear hollows I've
got five of them first up star alia
Clips all I can think of is Twilight for
some reason is this hollow Team Edward
or Team Jacob you decide you guys are no
stranger to this top coat you've seen me
use it before because it is very
Halloween and by that I mean it has lots
of rainbows we get a pretty decent dose
of holo on the first coat just to
control as many extraneous variables as
possible I'm only going to be applying
one coat of each holo top coat also
let's check out all the hollow top coats
and two different sources of light this
was shot under regular CFL daylight
bulbs and this is with an added halogen
bulb which helps to bring out the hollow
just a bit keep in mind that you can
only do the magical rainbow II
properties of hollow under direct light
so if you're taking pictures of your
hollow nails in a lightbox or with a
softbox with a white sheet that diffuses
the light and your pictures of the
hollow are dull and not rainbowy
that's why you can't diffuse the light
that's like putting clouds in front of
the Sun light boxes are no hallow
impromptu lighting lesson is now over
let's resume the experiment and what do
we got here we've got Prison Break by
Katie shimmer this one seems a little
bit thicker in terms of the consistency
of the polish let's see how it applies
the distribution of the Hallows is okay
but for some reason this one seems a
little cloudier and maybe not as hollow
was the last one
let's compare so people don't just trash
me for being biased they can see it for
themselves with their own eyes what a
concept
yep the star early one is definitely a
little bit more hollow as evidenced by
the rainbow rainbows don't lie don't you
know let's move on - I love nail
polishes my private rainbow L L stands
for linear hollow who can't see now I
love nail polish has a couple other
silver hollow polishes that
be used as a topcoat like the mega
series but according to their website
the my private rainbow series is
intended to be the holo topcoat so
that's why I'm just using this one okay
this is sadly not really that hollow at
all this is one coat I really love most
I love nail polish hollows but this
particular one just doesn't have the
same BAM holo in-your-face effect you
know where are the rainbows
I see no rainbows now here's one I've
already loved many times on this channel
bond lacquer diamond shine bright like a
diamond diamonds are forever forever
okay that's enough Christine stop it
there are so many hollows in this thing
and they are just so jam-packed tied
together and the rainbow is real but one
coat this is I already know one of the
vast hollows because look at that
coverage the coverage is real now check
it out under halogen lights OOP the
rainbows come a lap baby
well this comparison is really unfair
because I love nail polish one has been
the worst so far thoria had to compare
you to foot lacquer that's just the way
the order went down okay next up Nicole
by OPI z-- imagine if that's so cryptic
Nicole so cryptic of you so something
doesn't really seem right about this
polish because it kind of looks more
silver than it does hollow maybe that's
why it's called imagine if imagine if
this was actually hollow guys just
imagine just pretend and buy it anyways
why did I order this again no yeah I was
on Amazon searching hollow top coats and
this came up for some reason first you
tricked me into thinking this was
actually an OPI nail polish and then you
tricked me into thinking this was hollow
fooled me once shame on you fooled me
twice shame on me
ah for the record there actually is
hollow in here because I can see some
rainbow but I'm convinced that there's
also some silver crap in there that is
not hollow kinda looks a little to me
like they're trying to dilute the hollow
and cut a little bit of corners a shame
so much shame now we're moving on to the
scattered hollow top coats in other
words these hollows are less dense more
dispersed and the size of the hollow
particle is usually larger let's start
off with Revlon holographic
girls cuz bam drugstore yet get my
drugstore on drugs drugs drugs
I mean drugstore drugstore drugstore
okay so this is pretty jam-packed with
hollow isn't it
yeah like the head I don't see any sign
of diluting hollows here every single
tiny sparkle looks hollow to me this is
good this is good kids it actually never
uses before this is the first time I use
this and I am thoroughly impressed right
now look at that hollow drip and smear
all of I would love these as a pearl
necklace just for fun let's compare it
to that lame excuse for a hollow taco
yep there you have it folks
hollow sexuals can spot a faker in no
time
next let's try out falling star by coal
by Orly for those of you who don't know
what the hell that is that's because
it's only sold in Canada yes I am
Canadian that's why I say a sometimes it
okay okay so this one's pretty similar
to the Revlon one the hollow particles
might be a tiny bit smaller I don't see
any cloudy crap dilution of the hollows
going on here so that's good film this
in the wrong order but here's me
applying falling star beside shady
Nicole shady equals cloudy let's move on
to this hollow top coat I forget the
name if you didn't just shout out that
gonna mellow top coat at your screen
then I am very disappointed you weren't
taking notes in my last class this was
basically a trick just to see if you are
really paying attention polishes NCL a's
party favorite spelt the american way
and it's made up of tiny iridescent
glitter
they are definitely sparkly and have an
element of color shifting sort of
borderline rainbow to them but they're
not actually holographic kind of like
the same materials unicorn skins except
this was chopped up into tiny little
pieces another test you can do to spot
the hollow is to blur everything well on
the left you are seeing a lot of
different colors come through ranging
from orange to yellow to green to blue
but with the one on the right you get
the full rainbow treatment because that
one is actually hollow that was the one
we just tested and here's another look
at the difference which reinforces my
point about the rainbow even more just
ask yourself which puddle looks more
attractive to unicorns and you shall
find the answer my friends next up salon
perfect cosmic dust six one three
oh that's the Ottawa telephone area code
coincidence probably not I got this one
in my local drugstore but then I
researched it and found that it's really
not a prominent brand at all because you
can't even get this on Amazon what so
maybe it's not actually a drugstore nail
polish to you but it is to Canadians
anyways it's got some beautiful
holographic rainbows in there I'd say
it's a little bit more dispersed than
the last couple we've seen of the
scattered group and the particles might
be even smaller let's move on to China
Glaze fairy dust this one's a timeless
classic even memes have been made about
it it's hollow pieces are on a slightly
smaller side just a bit does size matter
for a hollow takwa matter how you tell
me that's a very personal intimate
question
it's rainbowy under all the different
kinds of lights and I see no dilution of
the hollows at all this is good things
are going very well so far I'm applying
it beside the last one we just tried
and like they look very similar in fact
I kind of think they're almost dupes are
these dupes
let's analyze closer someone get the
microscope Wow
it's amazing how exactly the same they
look just trying to LAN perfect what's
going on here nail polish conspiracy
we're almost done we're almost done I
promise this is or Alize Prisma glass
silver because they also have a gold one
it looks a little bit more jam-packed
than the last couple we've seen so this
could be interesting but as I'm applying
it I noticed that there is something up
with this polish that I can't put my
finger on well I can put it on my finger
though mm-hmm it definitely appears
super hollow when you blur it but as I
get up close I can't help but notice
that it looks like there's tiny little
shards that aren't actually Hollow yeah
oh there's some little pieces that
aren't the same shape and it kind of
looks like they were chopped up in a
messy machine that could be a hint maybe
hollow topcoats really are like diamonds
they're not all cut with quality and
finally I'm gonna try Northern Lights
hologram topcoat in silver I know what
it looks like but you have to shake it
this polish is very different from the
rest because whatever base is suspended
in doesn't actually mix around the
hollows normally you got to do it
yourself
sounds like more work to me but if it
pays off and willing to do it ooh hollow
stick or pretty this one is way more
liquidy and watery than all the others
you can see that polish is kind of drip
right off the brush not necessarily a
bad thing if you know how to control
your brush at first glance it's obvious
that this is definitely way more
dispersed than all the others I've tried
so far but it's not lacking in hollow I
mean look at that rainbow oh my god it's
so rainbow he is beautiful
like I was saying at the beginning of
this video it really depends on what
effect of hollow you want if you want
the hollows to be more dispersed then
this is a great one but if you want more
hollow than this one probably isn't your
best choice here's another look at how
it compares to the oily one I just tried
even though the one on the right is more
dispersed and there's not as many
hollows in them
not that I'm going to count them
definitely reflects more rainbows than
the one on the left and I think that's
because the Orly had some chopped up
pieces of silver or glass-like flecks
that weren't actually Hollow and that
concludes the showdown let's rank the
contenders for linear hollow top coats I
think it's pretty obvious that the fun
lacquer one is the hollow ball calm it's
so damn passion Hollow attack it can
help it's so satisfying look at that
flare just look at it I would say that
the star early one comes in second for
me because it's a little less dense but
it's still super rainbowy KB shimmer got
some points because the name is legit
Prison Break fans anyone but that prison
for cash is a little too cloudy for me
I love nail polish I'm sorry but I think
the rainbow was too private that we
couldn't see it and lastly Nicole get
out of here you're basically not even
holo kind of like how you're basically
not even OPI goodbye moving on to the
scattered hollow top coats and this one
was much trickier because there wasn't
necessarily one that was more BAM than
the others you know but I'm gonna have
to go with Revlon holographic pearls as
the winner because that is some serious
hollow payoff in just one coat it's so
rainbow II the tiny hollows have a
really nice shape and you can get it at
the drugstore that's probably why I'm
most impressed you win this one Revlon
quote by aurélie comes in second
because Canadians love getting second
place at the Olympics in third place
we've got ourselves a tie between China
Glaze and salon perfect because they
literally look the exact same both
applied the same on the nail on paper
can anyone see a difference next I'm
gonna have to go with the Northern
Lights topcoat because even though it's
super diluted and watery compared to the
rest the hollows are actually hollow II
as far maybe that's because it's sitting
in a super glossy base I'm not sure
lastly I'm gonna have to say I'm sorry
Orly even though you are definitely
jam-packed with hollows and pretty dense
I'm not so in love with the random
shards in there they're a little
deceptive I'm not even sure if they're
real you almost need a real microscope
and to see it but
I think that's what I'm seeing and CLA
doesn't get a ring because it's not
hollow and it was only included to test
your loyalty to the hollow kingdom now
let's have some fun and put the winners
over different colors I threw on five
random plain creme shades to see what
kind of magic the hollows would do to
them
here's fun lacquer diamond over all the
colors you can see that it really pops
best when layered over darker colors
like the purple
although the need one is nice and soft
and pretty maybe if you're going to
brunch with your grandma and the white I
thought that would be cool but you
really can't see it that much and here's
Revlon holographic pearls over all the
same colors and the effect is definitely
quite different again the rainbows
reflect best when layered over darker
polishes one thing I want to point out
about hollow top coats is that sometimes
if you're putting a hollow top coat over
a nail art design you may not actually
want to use the most dense hollow top
coat because it may cloud or cover the
design here's some cases where maybe the
hollow top coat covered up the design a
little bit I don't know it's really also
subjective it definitely works better
over darker colors so as you can see and
what the hell is that I don't know but I
was trying to save it with hollow now
this one on the other hand the design
called for the holiest hollow of them
all here's some examples where I used a
hollow top coat that was a bit more just
first so you could see the pattern a
little bit better and so in summary of
the amazing experiments we undertook
today to some degree a hollow candy
quote-unquote better than another
because of its ability to reflect
rainbows but in terms of density it's
really all about the look your feel and
you know what do you feel like today
linear or scattered how scattered do you
want to be the choice is yours
and of course when in doubt just sponge
that everywhere who cares if people
say too much hollow because can't see
the haters binded by the hollow haters
gonna hate and hollows gonna Hollow and
that's it for today please subscribe to
my channel because if you're not already
a hollow sexual you want to be one and
thanks so much for watching I'll see
y'all later BAM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
