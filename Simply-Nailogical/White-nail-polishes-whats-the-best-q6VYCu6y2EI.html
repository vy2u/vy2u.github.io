nail artist is finding the perfect white
polish to use as a base coat for your
amazing nail art don't lie I know you
stress about it all the time it's like
you have nightmares every night about
how you can't find the most perfect
white nail polish but the problem is by
now you must have bought eight million
different white nail polishes and not
one of them are any good because as new
bloggers like to say perfect for easy
coats and you're just like no that's so
stupid and annoying there's no such
thing as for easy coats because four
coats is not easy and then by that point
you're probably just thinking why can't
white nail polish just be opaque in one
coat like whiteout remember those days
back in grade school when you used to
paint your fingernails with liquid white
out yeah you remember you thought you
were cool cuz that you would color it
with highlighters and because I love you
all so much but mostly because I don't
like repeating myself and all my nail
art tutorials I did all the work for you
and tested ten different white nail
polishes I bring you the white polish
games and swipe to the death
for all the impatient people out there
here's the winner so I'm just gonna
spoil her right now it was color club
french tip polish and look at that
beautiful of baking one coat there are
some limitations with this polish which
I'll cover later but you have to stay
tuned for the next several minutes of
your life I know I don't have every
single white nail polish that exists in
the world to test for you today but I
have ten so that's a pretty good number
first up let's try cold nails tempest
now this has been my favorite white for
a really long time but they sadly went
out of business this year in 2015 so
that was a sad day for me
as you can see upon application on black
it's pretty thick over black in one coat
so yeah good stuff I really like the
Polish it's creamy and the formula is
great but because they're discontinued
we need to accept this death of polish
and move on next up we got pure ice
superstar and personally I'm really not
sure why they call this Polish superstar
okay like when I think of superstar I
think of hollow glitter or something not
white I use this white for a while I
really like how thick it is upon first
coat my only issue with it is that it
didn't really even out like it was
streaky in some sections and now
bloggers like to use the term self
leveling so I would say that this polish
didn't self level very well here's some
random brand I found in my stash from
like probably 12 years ago
it's Inglot and it doesn't have a name
you know I don't see your name anywhere
on this bottle 0:38 that's its name okay
Apollo 0:38 very streaky as you can see
yeah when it starts to fade right away
over the block and you see those little
X bodies forming that's probably not a
good polish to use no definitely not
it's like spotted milk or maybe it's
just because it's 12 years old whatever
here's another one from sesh
early well-known random-access meet
topcoat and this one didn't seem to have
anything to be there just some weird
numbers but I got it on my local
pharmacy if that means anything to you
guys let's try it out
pretty sick at Kursk Oh looks good but
then when I start to push the brush down
you do see that it is getting a bit
streaky and we want to try and minimize
the number of coat so if it's drinking
on the first coat then I'ma pass this
way it's actually a stamping polish by
mundo de unas I don't know I don't have
a Spanish accent its colour number one
and as you can see it's super thick
which is great it's probably the closest
to liquid white out so far but it smells
like car paint actually I'm pretty sure
it is car paved and I grew up in a car
shop when I was young so I would know
what car paint smells like the company
doesn't list their ingredients anywhere
on the bottle or on their website
I wonder why let's try a new color club
from the shift into spring 2015
collection this is blank canvas and by
the sounds of the name you think it'd be
a great polish for a blank canvas but
nope very sneaky way too thin it would
probably be opaque and for easy coats
let's try one of the popular classic
this is a C's bla bla means white and
French for all use Anglophones that
and I might as well be painting with
milk this is why I hate to share white
polish okay like I don't want to paint
milk on my nails milk is for my cereal
let's try another apparently nail
blogger favorite butts Opie eyes alpine
snow it has a much wider brush so that's
good for some of us who are lazy and
don't wanna do so many strokes but it's
still very milky nope this does not
satisfy my one coat requirement for
laziness a while back I found this Orly
plant flaw polish meant for French
manicures at Sally's and I bought it at
the time because I was like oh my god I
should probably buy this french tip nail
polish because I don't have one I just
have eight million other regular white
nail polishes but I brought at home and
I was surprised how it was a lot thicker
than like your se or OPI milk the only
problem though is that the brush in this
french tip polish is so skinny white
supposed to be just for French tip but
that's not going to work to paint my
entire nail as a white base so I got to
thinking maybe there is something to the
trench tip formula that's so different
from the milky formulas so I found color
club french tip that live love polish
and it was love at first wife oh yeah
look at that
it's like liquid white oh this is so
dreamy and creamy I love it nail polish
with milk then all the other ones would
be like skim milk and this one would be
home oval
so the trick is to first check around
your house and see if you have an old
white crappy color club nail polish with
a regular size brush and then go out and
grab color club french tip and when you
get it you can just switch the brushes
the French tip formula does get a little
bit thick so every now and then I'll use
some nail polish thinner that you can
pick up from Sally's or from Amazon at
the link below and just add four or five
drops to the formula to make it a little
bit smoother and then shake it up and
you're good to go well I hope these
white polish games were just as
entertaining for you as it went from
minty let's have a milk party and now
you know which nail polish to go for and
the trick is get a french tip nail
polish but make sure the brush is thick
enough so you can hang your whole nail
and probably don't buy carpet I would
not recommend that unless you want to
smell like a car all the links to all
the milky and creamy nail polishes
featured in this video are below in the
video description box and remember that
you probably don't want to be putting
milk on your nails
got milk nope thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
