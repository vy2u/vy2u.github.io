imagine someone else other than me came
to do this tutorial that would be so
weird I was way too excited about my
last shattered glass nails that I wanted
to do them again except this time with a
more angelic look because I am an angel
the last look was black and Hollow and
this look is white and multi chrome
because I couldn't leave it just white
that would be so boring it's basically
the same design on all nails except on
the accent nail I reversed the colors
because sometimes I just like to see the
way things look with the opposite colors
and to show you this multi porn multi
chrome horn I mean just multi chrome
horn let me be clear this has got to be
one of the most powerful color shifting
multi Crump's I own it's my favorite
it's called blessing because it is truly
a blessing in life you can find it at
the link below in the video description
box and oh my God look at that shift to
purple and then it's blue and then it's
kiln it's gray wood back to boring
except this is really satisfying to
watch this basically one coat or white
slap on my nail oh yeah so creamy so
good mmm I had a quick dry top coat on
all of my nails because I'm gonna add
nail Finals on top of that Wow
how predictable Kristine clearly no one
would be able to do my tutorials for me
because they would just have no idea
what I would do next now vinyls from
twinkle tea use my coat
we for 10% off save money do you like my
song you can download it on iTunes along
with worm Ibiza I'm Miranda sings
we are besties I'm just using straight
stripe whatever
now vinyls to make a v-shape because
we're gonna fill in that B shape with
some white cream wow that was incredibly
inappropriate if you take that in the
wrong way but I guess I'm the one with
the dirty mind here now peel off those
bowling alley gutter lame things to
reveal the white people do it again on
your other nail but opposite because
sometimes I can't make up my mind which
way I want to do my nails this way as I
realized later isn't that effective
because the multi chrome needs to be
really sick for it to be opaque so then
I just basically had a swimming pool of
multi chrome polish I went a Mac ship
any day though hell yeah
unicorn skin yes I have reunited with
you I use just the pink to green
iridescent unicorn skin cellophane that
you would have seen in my other
shattered glass video in my other video
I explained what the correct type of
unicorn skin to buy is it's this one
it says celebrate Sika today is the day
of the unicorn so we must rejoice this
time I cut up the skins into more narrow
longer triangles but I was too lazy to
film that to give these clips are from
last time you could add a quick dried
topcoat here but looking back I'd
actually recommend just applying a clear
polish before sticking on the unicorn
skins because as you'll see since I
added a quick to our topcoat it dries
quick Wow
go figure which made it more challenging
to stick on the unicorn skins in time
before it dried up so you got to act
really quickly here do not let your
nails dry it is not the time to be
playing polish blast I've never played
it but I was once addicted to candy
crush and I just can't go back to that
dark time in my life see how the narrow
long triangle unicorns
and that should look pretty edgy and
sexy with all that crisscross back and
forth action yeah totally did that on
purpose and now I'm gonna do my other
nail which serves no purpose in showing
you it again because I'm literally doing
the same thing I'm on my way to becoming
a full-fledged
unicorn the only thing missing is Hollow
but I really just wanted to not you
follow this time because I wanted to
test and see if multi chrome also
brought out a similar form of sorcery
with the unicorn skin combination before
we decide let's add a really thick
glossy top coat wow it is so satisfying
to watch all that wetness go on the
longer unicorn skin fragments are not
working out in my favor did anyone
notice what was on my other hand do you
see this magic this is not unicorn skin
but it's fun lacquer flaky that I put on
a multi chrome I wrote the polish combo
I use to create this effect down in the
video description box and now let's
examine the multi chrome unicorn blue
girl yeah do you see that shift from a
beautiful warm purple to the turquoise
green I'm adding a second thick glossy
top coat I also put the length of this
glossy top coat down below because it's
super high gloss and it's so thick in
fact the one I'm using now is supposed
to have a gel effect and I think it
really has a gel effect without being
actual gel I can see map
in the bottle and I loved it and I loved
it I don't know what should my
conclusion about these nails be guys
help me out I mean it looks pretty cool
when it shifts to the purple blue under
the unicorn skin but it's not really
doing anything extra special with the
skin effect you know it's probably
because I'm a hollow sexual that nothing
else will ever measure up to the amazing
satisfaction that Hollow can give me
that's okay we give all shiny objects a
chance oh when you say unicorn loved me
no well Apollo more oh when you say
Unicorn need me know I need Paolo more
hayek blah ha ha yo boo boo boo you
Kapoor boo I explore hard you go to
cuckoo
people poopoo tune and okay we're just
gonna end on that see y'all next time
