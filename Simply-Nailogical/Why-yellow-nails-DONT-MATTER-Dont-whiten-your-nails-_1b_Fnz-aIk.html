got something special in store for you
today I'd like to break your haters
hearts and dispel an old wives tale
about yellow nails meaning that your
very unhealthy and your nails are weak
and ugly and hideous and therefore you
suck none of that is true let me just
get this out of the way before we move
on I don't smoke I don't have liver
cancer
I don't rub self-tanner on my nails I'm
not a MEK addict and I don't need any
vitamins okay
you notice my nails are yellow good for
you you made an observation now hear
this as my trusted nail Bible says if
you love nail polish you're going to
have stained nails yellow nails are just
a reality of changing your polish really
often and having a particular fondness
for darker polishes which I do a lot of
on my swatch ink and here's some proof
check out my nails on my other hand
which iron is yellow because I don't
paint them as much now this is usually
how the story goes so your know-it-all
friend is like your nails are yellow
because I need to breathe and science is
like no kids nails are like hair and
they're dead just because you dye your
hair doesn't mean your hair is not
healthy
just like how when your nails are yellow
it doesn't mean your nails art health
regular quality nail polish itself is
not bad for your nails no matter how
much you wear it in fact it's good it
traps the good oils into your nail and
protects your nail from breaking
staining is just the result of repeated
wear of nail polish so technically yes
if I stopped painting my nails for four
to six months and let them grow out
Foley if they didn't break without
then my nails wouldn't be yellow but
that means you'd miss out on all my
tutorials on nail art and I would lead
the most boring life ever
I could whiten my nails with bleach or
other questionable chemical household
items but having tried bubble white
bullshit once before I know that these
kinds of products are actually damaging
to your nails for a couple of reasons
first of all anything that involves
soaking your nails in water or another
liquid is damaging to your nails because
water pushes the nail layers apart which
leads to peeling and freaking seconds do
you really want to rub bleach or other
random chemicals into your nails bleach
may seriously dry out your nails and
even damage the cuticle and surrounding
skin I tried bubble white soap or
whatever it's called around a year ago
and it left my nails with peeling pieces
all over I freaked out and never
tortured my nails again I could buff my
nails but then I'd be sanding through a
couple layers of nail every stroke thus
weakening my nails and making them more
prone to breaking do not fuck your nails
and I think it's clear that I'd much
rather strong resilient yellow nails
than weak less yellow nails I always use
a base coat and while that does help
prevent some staining there is no
winning base coat that can prevent a
hundred-percent of staining it's just
something that's bound to happen with
time so you can judge my yellow nails
all you want but really that what are
you racist against my nails like what is
your issue but I wonder who really has
the stronger nails in the end I
recommend that you get over the fact
that you may have yellow nails forget
about all that non-scientific whitening
crap and just keep painting them while
using your regular base coat because I
mean really though are your nails ever
naked anyways
I put links to some of the sources for a
lot of what I've explained to you today
down below it's a great company that
rates a whole bunch of educational
truth-telling articles about male health
you better check them out I put a link
to a bunch of my favorite articles below
moral of the story is if your nails are
yellow it doesn't even matter because
you're gonna cover them up with Polish
as long as they're strong and flexible
see down below for my favorite way to
keep your nails that way then you're
good to go
and if your nails are super white then
you either bleach the crap out of them
don't pay your nails enough to achieve
true happiness or you're an alien or
you're Russian well I hope you haters
learn something today and if you didn't
then I can't help you thanks for
