lot of trash well hallo everyone it's me
Christine again and I'm still here I'm
not dead yet but I'm certainly not
getting any younger and since I have
YouTube money now thank you for that
it's time I do the responsible thing
that adults do and take care of some
personal legal matters it's time I make
a will a water marble what but my lawyer
told me it's actually a really
complicated process and it takes a long
time to make a formally drafted will and
it's pretty expensive I don't know about
you but the thought of spending money on
what will happen when I die doesn't
really make me all that excited who
gives up you're dead okay I should at
least have something in writing just in
case what if I OD on hollow flakies you
just never know and so today together we
are going to make get this my
holographic will this is actually a
legal concept kids unite I'm gonna prove
it to you now Wikipedia where you a a
holographic will is a will and testament
that has been entirely hand written and
signed by the testator I think that's me
there must be evidence that the testator
actually created the will which can be
proved through the use of witnesses and
writing experts or other methods today
meant evil service witness the testator
must have had the intellectual capacity
to write the will that's questionable
holographic wills are common and are
often created in emergency situations
such as when the testator is alone
trapped and near death
sounds about right I mean this all
sounds great but what about this will is
holographic I'm just gonna look up a
second opinion
as with any legal document it is always
prudent to obtain legal advice okay so
what kind of legal advice can we get
from you two got a research twice and
write your will once kids if you don't
do the proper amount of research you're
gonna regret it when you're dead wow
this is a growing DIY community let's
start with this one because this guy
looks like you know what he's talking
about a holographic will is one that is
hold on I need to take notes professor
Eric Jason I got my Hollow notebook we
have some good evidence that it really
was the person's intended will because
it was by their own hand that sounds
like come on professor is 2018 14
minutes uh-huh I might die by the time I
finish that yes you may write out a
valid will on the back of a napkin
that's a great clickbait title why does
this only have like 30 views hello my
name is Jonathan Barlow I'm a partner
attorney it's called a holographic will
one is it seen your handwriting number
two you date it number three you sign it
that's a will common problem that we
sometimes see with this is that somebody
will will get on the computer and type
out using science because laws are still
ancient but if you do it on your
computer and date it and sign it it's
not an effective will handwritten or
holy or graphic wills holy a graphic
will holy a graph holy shit therefore
handwritten wills should never be
attempted a will should be prepared by
an attorney
I'm not sure I'm buying what he's
selling I think he just wants you to pay
more money to hire him to make your well
when you could just make all of Africa
one yourself what is a holographic will
Anita a holographic grill is a
handwritten will and they are not
accepted in Florida at this time what
you Florida bitch why did you even make
a video comments are disabled were you
afraid of the hate legal videos on
YouTube are weird
by the way disclaimer this video is not
to be construed as actual advice my
actual lawyers wanted me to say that
part alright let's look over our notes
to get there so to summarize holographic
will must be handwritten it must be
signed so it's like an easy DIY will I'm
down for that but nowhere does any of
this say that it can't be covered in
hollow glitter let's get to work
can't waste any time cuz I could be dead
any second now
oK we've got the perfect template
everything looks great except for those
stains at the bottom I think that's nail
oil but it's fitting let's start with my
home I hereby give this condo to Ben on
the condition that he bring me tea to my
grave every day right 90 that's right a
full scholarship of savory salmon dinner
school of fine cuisine goes to Medici
you're welcome sweetie and Tyler can go
straight to his PhD because I don't mind
if he takes over the world coz I'll be
dead huh my markers already dead and it
didn't even have a will what else do I
own a value my nail polish in the event
of my death I wish for all of my nail
polish to be evenly distributed among
the first two thousand three hundred and
sixty-seven people who comment down
below and you must be subscribed to my
channel to be eligible what about my
Paley bag it shall be auctioned on eBay
and 100% of the proceeds will be evenly
distributed among all the countries who
don't have hallo
now what should I give my sister all of
my PR makeup and Jenny also gets all of
my hoodies and sweaters because she
needs to keep her shirt on gotta look
out for my delinquent little sister who
should get my YouTube channel has to be
someone who can carry this channel
forward with grace and dignity someone
who people love it also has to be
someone I can trust
how about my dad what is this YouTube
anyways
I mostly just think that that would be
really funny people turn in to my
channel expecting to see me but I'm dead
now so they seem a six-year-old father
making terrible dad jokes yeah your your
humor and your good looks for me hey I
mean he already has his own fan page now
what shit can I give to fellow youtubers
it's jenna Marbles upon my death jenna
Marbles
will get my cat Mitchy because jenna
needs a strong independent woman cat I'm
sorry Julian Sophia Nygaard will get all
the shit I bought off wish Robin Curran
from Fred beggar you see I would have
given them that car we painted together
for hours with nail polish but then they
went ahead and burned it so I can't give
it to them cannot so you can go yourself
thread banger you're out of the way I
want what I give to all my new beauty
guru friends I don't have any car che
have Swarovski earrings they're really
nice what about all of my sweatpants yes
that's perfect
besides tattoo you I know you like my
sweatpants okay I see you in your snaps
girl now for my residual youtube money
for stuff that was uploaded before I
died I wish for it to be split evenly
among all youtubers who've been
demonetized and lastly for some final
instructions upon my death I shall be
cremated and my ashes mixed with hollow
glitter and incorporated into a nail
polish available to the mass markets but
for subscribers only and now before we
Dayton sign this legal document I think
this will needs to be a bit more
holographic
and naturally we're gonna need some
holographic smiley face stickers because
smile you're dead signed on this day in
Ottawa Canada witnessed by probably over
1 million people Christine / simply
magical
BAM got myself a holographic will no
judge would ever dare dismiss this will
okay we got video evidence this bitch is
gonna hold up in court
funny I have a will it's legally binding
no no it's legally blinding yeah yeah
when I die don't get any ideas come have
a seat bet we can discuss the rest of
the terms of my will if you wish no no
other bitches get see good point okay
we're just gonna amend this will I'm
gonna file an amendment hey hey what are
you doing I'm making a mess in the place
it could be yours one day you should
have it real well though this is a real
well the YouTuber lawyers told me though
so if you get hit by a bus tomorrow what
I'm giving I'm not giving been cheated
Jenna right that head get it girl

with hollow glitter made into new that's
right you follow those instructions to
the tee this Afiya stuff room way so

need a lawyer for a holographic well

am that's the evidence tell you if I
ever need to contest let me check here

gonna have to just get your corpse in a
chair no my dad will run the channel and
he'll make millions
dad dad we want dad you want to be
buried with you you do money cremated
with your Adsense earnings oh that's
kind of tacky I prefer holo says right
here section 12
all right I think I'm satisfied are you
I want you to show this to our lawyer
can we send him a picture buddy um I
gotta drop this is quite Wow look at
that holo shift oh I can't wait for a
court to take a look at this it's time
for you to have all the graphic will
because you just never know but most
importantly what I want you to take away
from this video aside from the
importance of what happens after you die
is that while you're alive make sure to
have some fun before you die
this is so much fun I want to do that
every weekend every weekend while I make
a new will and then it'll be like will
Roulettes whenever I die it'll be the
will I have made that week that's a one
game all right everybody thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you all later
maybe
