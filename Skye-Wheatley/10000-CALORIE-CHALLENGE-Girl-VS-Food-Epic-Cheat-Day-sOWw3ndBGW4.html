what I was going to eat
I brought my snakes there's a disgusting
baby I don't know how you eat them but
please just leave all alone oh and by
the way guys not rule you're not allowed
to drink you calories is
because drinks have colors in them too
and people need to be aware of how how
many calories that's why they say it's
changed so much I'm so much easier to
drink what it and worry about okay it's
not easier to drink there because it's
so much in it
silver make you feel full so that all

having I'm having a scrap paper McDonald
they blend what ice cream they blend
whatever they use the blender and still
classified as food it still has the
colors in it I'm still gonna drink it

be just as dangerous as food as well I

so impossible for me to do if I don't
include a drink maybe we'll see so let's
go you know is bad

680 calories in a caramel frappe from
McDonald's and then there's 150 calories
in one hash brown and I'm having three
of them and then there's 450 calories in
a sausage and egg McMuffin and then I
got barbecue sauce which is 30 calories
I'm going to feel like tomorrow
these are even ordered a large
they make you today so hard to finish I
oh god oh god yeah
to contradict all know that alive these
actually tell you slowly because it's
fresh looks like so practice me what
there's definitely a challenge
I've sized i/o recording how you feeling
honey I'm going to never ever eat this
 again off-book after today I'm done
oh we got a great workout how much one
snake way so I can calculate how many
calories Empire something okay so the
time is a 125 I've just completed lunch
which came to 3595 right now I'm about
to watch a movie and I'm going to smash
this yup that's right the whole can turn
up oh no shovel that's what we're doing
over those well sir seek not to be
honest blow our nose sleep the amount of
calories I eat in one day is 1,500 so
I'm basically up to a week's worth of
calories which is absolutely disgusting
but I'm going to keep going because it's
a loose experiment see what this
does to your body my body okay so now
I've bought watermelon my induction also
good and I've got some water and the
best estimate
I'm just going to simple not oh my God
my stomach is hurting anyway I'm going
to calculate how many calories is in the
in the watermelon hey that's dawn
what's the time got the first red water
time no my daughter - all right dawn hey
guys so I just woke up from enough and I
feel like death
I could seriously keep sleeping all day
I couldn't even think about eating food
right now we were just coming over so I
can do her makeup and then I think I
might try to eat some me going noodles
and then it's back to bed because I feel
so weak and feel like I have no energy
and my mouth is like sir pasty and dry
disgusting
and
the calories I've learned and like it
just makes you feel so lethargic and
tired okay sorry
it's floor Pam and I am nowhere near
hungry or feeling ready to eat again
but I'm going to make some me going
noodles and I think I'm going to have at
least three packets so we go you can do
it you can do it you can be a fat way oh
I'm about to do my first poo of the day
and I'm really excited hopefully that
makes some more room for my me going
noodles I just added it up I'm going to
have three packets of me growing noodles
and that comes to a total of 1260
calories
me either
Oh what's the knight in shining ball
bearing your queen bee put your lips on
mine and love day after day now I'm no
one would understand how hard this is
and let they actually do it themselves
murdered is death right now I need a
hard core break up in me so I'm going to
have some cordial and you know it of
course I'm going to count them calories
because they got sugar in it girl I am
so close this close to saying this
challenge ginger buckets mum up the bum
because I'm not over it
I chose up sick all I want to do is lay
down and sleep I even know how many
functions are all next day and I never
ever want to eat like this ever again
 junk food seriously so I'm
currently at seven thousand two hundred
ninety two and four hundred milliliters
of audio is 106 calories
I was so disgusting you know I thought
that I could eat like a mammoth whale
but maybe I'm wrong maybe I can't eat
that much I mean ten thousand dollars is
ridiculous amount to try and feed
yourself in 24 hours like that people
wouldn't even eat that much would they
surely not about to do a body update
hole
I'm not even pushing y'all oh I'm a
break hey I need a break I mean I love
all that who would think it is
this is mentally disturbing it's really
disturbing singing it looks so much
easier when you're watching other people
do it but when you actually do it so
hard and I thought that I ate a lot half
Go Go me mum don't
I'm hon oh don't play nice
stop okay the time is 8:13 and I don't
have much time to complete the challenge
I'm going to go downstairs finish my
meal orange it and then I'll probably go
search the shop and see what else I can
find
I think maybe some Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's or
something but I'm seriously so ready for
this challenge to be over and getting
really sick and I always get this coughs
when I eat really badly and my eat junk
food it's like moving Kong's like I just
called every second I'm feeling really
unhealthy and I can just feel my immune
system just like bailing on me and I
just know that I'm going to get sick
from all this junk food but anyway we
don't do this

office of the table is wherever me and
my friend set the table do is just go
