channel it's Scott Murray Wade there
home Scott Murray Wheatland I have not
logged in the longest time I just felt
sorry gross about myself all last
weekend the week before and my getting
cut open was just like traumatic and
yeah my face is super dry because I went
and had needling done so it's kind of
like flaking at the moment but anywho I
am doing a juice cleanse Monday to
Tuesday it's been so long since I felt
like really good about my health I've
been really naughty and my off the track
like I normally usually am i find that
cleansing really gives my body a break
from all that that we put in our
bodies daily like everything you buy
from the shops is pretty much processed
unless it's a fresh vegetable so it's
good to let your body just have a break
from all that yes I'm doing a two day
juice cleanse and my juicers arrived
just now so I'm going to unpack them and
put them in the fridge I just absolutely
love how easy it is to do these juice
cleanse like they just come straight to
the door and you get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8
juices a day so I really don't have a
problem with my hunger at all because I
find the juicers really satisfy any
cravings that I have for food and
they've got all the nutrition that then
that your body needs daily in them so
you don't feel hungry it's really easy
to do and it just makes me feel strong
fresh and clean so I'm very excited for
my juice cleanse on Monday and Tuesday
at the moment I'm going to go catch up
with Brooklyn and I think we're just
gonna go to the gym and then tonight I'm
just gonna chill
they'll it out I'm filming a hole
at the moment as well so I'm just like
basically catching up on work and stuff
like that yeah good one teen I am
starting my juice cleanse today I just
had a shot of the rocket which is what
you have first it's like lemon pepper
salts I'm pretty sure that's it sea salt
yeah something like that it's just a
shot and I'm having milk and we're gonna
go get some breakfast for cam and yeah
I'm gonna drink my milk
guys my skin is literally flawless
because I had skin needling done the
other day and I swear by it like look at
my skin so soft I mean and I'm
glowing like look at that glow and you
start up I'm gonna put my facial ladies
Instagram it deep and down in the
description and I'll also put it on this
screen sorry if anyone's interested in
needling you can go see her because
she's literally the best it doesn't hurt
at all kind of this feels like
microdermabrasion I don't think she she
went too deep on the first guy she said
we'd go deeper next time but yeah if
you're scared or worried seriously it is
not painful at all they use numbing
cream on your face and then they just go
over it with little needles and yeah it
just feels like microdermabrasion so
make sure you try it because it
literally makes your skin not fall if
hey honey

I'm obsessed with start cute right my
color red is my color already
