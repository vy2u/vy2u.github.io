thing about this workout is that you
need absolutely no equipment this is
like a fully dedicated video to
beginners or Donnell with squats the
Browns are on so you want to do three
sets of 15 squats little and you want to
make sure that when you're coming up
you're squeezing your butt together
really really hard and you're focusing
on your bar just like connect your mind
your butt and just make sure you're
consciously thinking about squeezing
your butt as you come up wha-what are
you doing one more thing mornings girls
