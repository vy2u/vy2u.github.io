literally case I don't know here it is
sky
Rory Wheatley if you don't know who I am
you probably been living under a rock
because I'm so famous never shot my
windows everywhere call the cops on me
because I'm literally crazy and
I need to go to a mental institute hi
guys and welcome back to my channel it
stopped hurry
wait the whole sky Laurie wait welcome
back to our channel you guys I feel like
I haven't sat down and just talk to you
for the longest time Emma
sorry today I thought we would have a
little bit of fun and going through or
what I bought from America now today
when I was like trying to gather
everything because obviously I'm filming
a whole I didn't actually gather that
much and I was like holy guys this
all you bought when you were in
America like there's literally the best
shopping in America and that's just so
much makeup but it's not actually that
much cheaper so I was just being my
normal stingy self and I'm like well if
I don't need it
she's better desperately needed that I'm
not gonna buy it sir yeah I just had
that mindset the whole time I was there
and I literally bought hardly anything
but I'm gonna go the other thing I did
buy was makeup so I'm gonna show you
through what I got it's not a lot
somehow it was still so
expensive and I don't even know why oh
wait yeah I do because makeup is very
expensive
I just can't believe this is oh my god
oh my god I just remember a few more
things that are downstairs I'll be right
back mm-hmm beef animal money
don't act like you forgot I caught us
ha pay me what you owe me don't act like
you yeah I said bitch is a disco
get down get low dance and move your
body round the flow ha yeah whoa whoa
whoa aah
so I get sent downstairs and got I think
like three more things that I bought
okay
don't know a lot like wow sky live a
little seriously I just never spend
money on myself but it's dark anyway
I'll get straight into the video America
was great dearly loved the group of
friends that I went with we had so much
fun together we did you you like a lot
of shopping I basically just
spent most my money on makeup pants I
just pull this off a whole packet of
days they are protein balls from Owens
best no down on sponsoring this videos
just letting you know I'm a pig
okay guys I swear this is not all like
it can't be this can't be all that bored
I kind of reeking I'm leaking first
thing that I was most excited to get
that I had my heart set on getting was
the Buddha
Beauty palette what what is the name of
this like don't they have names
it's the rose gold edition as you can
see I have used a few of the colors and
let me tell you the matte colors are so
 stunning but I am like a little
bit a lot a bit disappointed in the
shimmery colors because you can
literally not pick these colors up on a
brush like I have tried they are
only pigmented if you pick them up with
your finger and if I made that don't
work girl because I've acrylic nails on
I literally hate applying makeup with my
fingers I won't even apply primer with
my fingers like I used a brush for
absolutely everything so for me this
not tickle my fancy you know what I mean
but anything no I got just weird see if
that worked why did it why is this one
like it's gone old yok yes they really
need to use your finger to apply them
and I don't like that I don't like that
at all girl my fave Mac brush think this
brush is so good it's the Mac 239 it's
so good for picking up shadows and like
it just make makes the eyeshadows really
pigmented the bristles are just really
good at picking up product and like girl
I cannot pick up it won't normal see if
you try to use a brush on them oh that
is what happens can you say that and it
will really pick up nothing like nothing
done about besides that I love the matte
colors they are super pigmented and they
blend really well I'm just really
disappointed in these shimmery colors
because they are so beautiful I just
wish that the brush would pick them up I
could not get the product onto a
brush like sure please get your
together then I went to Mac and I picked
up two lipstick colors and one two three
four okay so four well I am too stingy
speech you will ever meet like what the
 sky seriously buy more colors so
that your whole viewer is more
entertaining part of me alright sorry
the colors I got from Mac ah boldly bad
I left LA oh my god I can't read Wow
okay it's alright I'm just slower than
your average etc etc like etc why the
 can you read that's yours lately
oh my god go get a lay and then I got
spice and ulcer I got double time
so that is double time I love that color
it's like a pinky a nerdy fella like
 yeah me up the ass
yeah yeah baby and really wanna
double time we go Duke
okay sorry this color is spice this one
here the thing
so that's excetera there it's like a
really if yeah it's a nerd it's a nerd
it's a nerd come up yeah if that one is
boldly bare there on the end wow they're
all really similar aren't they I just
picked a very similar colors didn't I
you can tell what my favorite colors are
can't you like pinky nudes dark nerds oh
my god I just go to tech saying mansion
house party tonight come back I
made well I'm done up I'm young my turns
not too bad like yeah yeah maybe
alright probably shouldn't see no
self-control anyway that's the loop
planners I got and then I got to matte
lipsticks one is kind of sexy kind of
sexy okay so it's like a pinky peachy
pinky peachy color
would you say I don't know I just know
I'm gonna make a bodice and I just don't
know okay I've gotta stop doing that
boys can you not okay and then I got
satin from Mac and here's what satin
looks like has not been used at all so
it's like a really deep pinky purple a
deep pinky purple but there's two colors
of star nice yeah that's why you bought
them sky shut up honestly you do
me head in
night mate I also picked up some lip
glosses I got the true face lip
injection glosses store I got the
plumping gloss which is the one that
makes sure that's really tingle when you
put it on and supposed to like give them
a swollen effect so your lipstick on
like swollen and then I got this really
cute nude color and this is Spice Girl
and I also got angel kisses which is
like a really light pink color oh yeah
jokes what the and then I also got
Marc Jacobs lip gloss which is the
complete wrong color I was using my
cools Marc Jacobs lip gloss the whole
time over there and it's like really
funny about people using his makeup if
it slips if it's something to do with
the lips and the eyes cause obviously
that's really unhygenic
but yeah I was like Michael what color
should I get and he told me and I must
have picked up the wrong color
and got this instead it's actually
hideous I'll show you going to a
fairy potty that's what this color is
iron iron smells like peppermint though
I guess you could put it over to the top
of other color you guys are probably
just sitting nudging um guy he had a
bright pink flowery pink color room
before you started the video like don't
pay back color but not inner I guess I
guess I can use it it will be put to use
trust me that's all tea girl I picked up
the nausea glory foundation which is
 amazing I'm obsessed with this
foundation I'm obsessed with Nas the
brand is literally my favorite brand and
I just think that that products are
really good and high quality you'll pay
look for their stuff but it is worth it
and this is in the color medium for
Barcelona
 glow get on it guess the suck on it
then I picked up the Naz foundation
stick and this is also in the color
battler nut medium for eyes use this the
other day and I don't know how my skin
kind of went flaky but I don't know if
it was because my skin is feeling dry or
if I didn't prime
I always forget to prime that could have
been one of the reasons why my face was
flaky but it is seriously like the best
color match when I have my tan on that's
why I got it I got the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi and or my god like hands-down
favorite foundation if I don't know
where these are L'Oreal it treats me
well it puts me in a great mood it looks
great on my skin the only thing with
this is if you were push it I just got
lipstick on my chin there oh oh my god
Skye Oh sir sounds like something the
only thing with this foundation would be
if you have an oily and naturally oily
skin type I would not recommend this
because it is so Joey
it's Joey okay it's oily it makes you
shine from the top of the ADI other
movie Annie in there like they're
singing the song and they're like oh my
god please stop talking please stop
talking anyway what was I saying yeah
nore this is been a little dude but at
the end of the day it still goes really
early but I kind of like that because my
skin is super dry so what I'm basically
trying to say is don't get these
foundation if you have
my skin because you will not like it
okay then I also got the L'Oreal True
Match super blendable makeup which I
have not tried yet so if you guys want
to see a first impressions on this fun
version all of them on ah-ha-ha-ha
let me have a film appoint then I also
got the L'Oreal Paris infallible format
I used a tiny bit of this on my face
today and let me tell you actually I
mixed it with this one I mix them
together so I can't say I've fully tried
this and reap the benefits of it or thin
how it's going to look just wearing it
on a torn I don't let me know if you're
one of those long from the tiny bit that
I've used on my face I was like me I
like you winking okay yeah I liked it
apparently everyone raves about these
foundations I think I'm gonna get it
yeah you know that's that so next thing
I got is haha the Becca highlight and
this is in the color opal I really
wanted to replace my champagne pop one
because it's all smashed and it's just a
bit of a pain but I ended up getting
this color instead because it is
absolutely stunning seriously amazing
it's so pigmented and so creamy

good highlight and I love it I love this
brand probably one of my favourite
highlights so far from what I've tried

another thing that I wanted to talk to
you guys about was the whole I'm not
gonna say his name but the whole
ex-boyfriend thing a lot of you guys
have been asking what has happened and
seriously I don't even know what's
happened for two years of my life like I
kind of just I'm so happy to be out of
that relationship because it was so so
toxic a few things happen that were
pretty traumatic and I don't know if I'm
ready to talk about what happened or if
you guys would even want to know what
happened it could either be a really bad
thing or a really good thing if I were
to talk about it but the only reason I
would talk about it is to help other
people who may be experiencing at the
same situation or the same draman's in
their life I'm Maria it just would have
been really good if I could have had
someone to talk to that I could have
related to when I was going through what
I was going through I don't know I think
I need to think long and hard whether or
not I want to let come out and say what
happened and obviously like I don't want
to bag anyone out and I don't gonna make
anyone feel as though I'm trying to make
my ex look bad because that's not what I
would be doing the main reason I would
want to like openly talk about it is to
help others and that's it because I am
so so happy now and I'm just like really
happy that
finally woke up the strength and
realized that these things kept
happening because it wasn't right and
I'm really happy that I just like
completely shut that door and it's just
crazy what happens when you do the right
thing by yourself and you do the right
thing by the other person and you just
going look this isn't working
why are we doing this
you just closed it you live it and you
move on and life goes you've done
well done I'm proud of you
here's your awards watch your life get
better because you did the right thing
okay life's all about lessons and
learning things and going through
situations that may not be good in order
to see the rainbow at the end of the
tunnel no that's not right to see them
to see the light at the end of the
tunnel that moment to say but yeah thank
you guys so much for watching this video
