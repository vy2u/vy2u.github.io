it's Skye no Brady we may sky Marie Oh
scab really they're all she's back oh
you chew step on up you have two who
sure don't bring a burger bring it down
in today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you guys a product that I love so
dearly and a product that I thought I
would share with you guys because I'm
sure if I love it
then you guys probably love it as well
I'm all about sharing there's good
products and helping you guys out where
I feel it's helped me out you know cuz I
like to I like to put what I'm vibing
out there you know what I mean
you know what I mean anyway you guys
have probably heard about this brand
before it's a very well known brand
they've been around for a long time and
they've been producing some goddamn good
products these products today I am going
to be sharing with you my honest opinion
and my honest view on the products so
stay tuned if you want to know a little
bit more about
falling buddy no no if you can see the
pair experimental IKEA table I'm not
sure here are some of the products that
I've been loving from Bali buddy they
are not only products that you can use
in the summer time they are also
products that you will be loving in the
winter time so I just wanted to share
with you guys what I got from them what
I'm loving and you know explain to you a
little bit about these products maybe
you've thought about buying them before
and you're not quite sure so I thought I
would give a little quick review on a
few things that they sell ok so the
number one product which is my personal
favorite just because I have used it so
much and I just love what it does for me
is the Bali body BB cream now you can
tell that I love this product and then
I've used it's very dirty it's been
sitting in my makeup case because I
really love to wear this underneath my
makeup or even on a day when I'm feeling
like I don't want to wear makeup at all
I just put this over the top of my skin
it hydrates my skin it's got SPF 15 and
also has that like nice bronzy tint to
make you look more alive you know cuz go
without makeup these days I do not look
you might n it's gone I don't have a tan
anymore I just got back from Bali and I
seriously did not go in the Sun at all
when I got back from Bali so my tan has
just been slowly fading which is really
sad but yeah I love this BB cream
I'm not found anything that compares to
it it's all natural ingredients and it
hydrates your skin as well as protects
it from the Sun and also it gives you
that really nice glow like I said the
multitasking beauty cream that combines
hydrating skincare benefits to protect
correct and perfect the skin or from
fighting for less coverage I would say
the coverage on this is about a 5 out of
10 oh maybe not maybe like I see some 10
I find the coverage is what I need just
to feel confident enough in my own skin
and also it doesn't feel like you're
wearing makeup it's so lightweight
what I love about it even when I am
wearing heavy makeup like today I will
still apply this I'm wearing underneath
my makeup now because I feel like it
really helps to hydrate my skin I've got
the weirdest skin it's like pimply and
it's dry and oily all at the same time
so when I'm feeling super dry I feel
like this really picks me up and don't
need to moisturize before applying my
foundation yeah I used to have to
moisturize my face before applying
foundation powder whatever but now
because of this I don't need to use it
at all because it's between one which is
amazing easy and really convenient for
me so that's why I like it and it's also
anti-aging which is also really good for
me because I'm like really
self-conscious about that now I'm 24
girls got a lot of lifelines going on
here so we want to keep that skin
looking young the second product I have
to show you guys is the bali body
curtain-up lip balm this is also SPF 15
girls anyways let me tell you I got so
very badly sunburn on my face when I
went to Bali locky and my lips go it was
not true not pretty not fancy not bougie
not anything good it was so bad my lips
blistered off I thought that I was
getting like five colds hold on my lips
and it stressed me out so bad I was like
frantically googling low and behold it
was some bad lips
sorry it's always so important that I
feel holidaying or if you're out in the
Sun for a prolonged period of time we
need to keep your lips hydrated and
protected from the sunlit because some
bug lips is the most painful thing I've
ever experienced and it just does not
look pretty like I could not wear
lipstick for my whole holiday and it was
really really painful anyway this is all
natural ingredients
it tastes like coconut so it's very
yummy very hard not to lick off your lip
but honestly this was the biggest
lifesaver for me
Bali when my lips for some but funnily
enough
I wasn't wearing it when my lips got
sunburned but after that I was wearing
this every day and it helped further
protect my lips and actually helped heal
the blisters because of the hydrating
properties and their gods got nourishing
oils so it actually hoped to clear up my
butt blisters lips faster than what it
would have if I weren't applying
anything really important to keep your
lips hydrated even in the winter as you
can still get bird by the sun's UV rays
so that's another good one another
product that they have is the Bali body
watermelon tanning oil sorry this is for
Sun tanning obviously it's SPF 6 there
you get that really nice deep natural
bronze tan when you lay in the Sun you
don't need to lay in the Sun for long
this speeds up the process of you
getting a natural tan it's all natural
ingredients vegan its hydrating so even
if I'm not using this to turn my skin in
fact if I feel really dry I'll often use
this on my skin just to give it back
that moisture and hydration I have like
very dry skin ever it's not caring and
honestly this smells so insane it is
like it's like a watermelon chopper chop
anyway I'm gonna stir ground using this
suntan oil it's ridiculous so I would
highly recommend this if you're wanting
true because I kind of hate laying in
the Sun for so long and waiting for that
tan to come like it's just so tedious
and I don't want to be laying in
something day so it's really helpful
that this helps me get that beautiful
natural bronzer you look quicker quicker
than your average these three products
are and after dark product I'm wearing
this one right now on my body
it's the bali body bronzing lotion so
basically it's just a hydrating lotion
that has bronzer in it so when you rub
it on the skin it will hydrate your skin
and give you that beautiful glory
perfect for the winter perfect if you
don't love putting fake tan on and you
just want to love bronze for like a
couple hours or for like a special event
or if you're going house
you know going on tinder date whatever
great for that and you have faked em on
at the moment but I just put it over the
top of my fake tan
anyway that's what it looks like it's a
moisturizer that gives you a beautiful
bronze glory smells like coconut - I
like this one because it doesn't dry out
your skin like I have other bronzing
lotions I I have used in the past and it
seriously makes my skin flake like this
one is actually quite hydrating
antioxidant rich moisturizer will
provide a hint of tint whilst smoothing
the skin with vitamin E and natural oils
this fast absorbing lightweight lotion
is enriched with organic caramel extract
to provide an instant bronze glow yeah
so I love that this product has all
natural ingredients like it's just
amazing because you can make yourself
look good but also be treating your skin
at the same time which is what I'm all
about
you know last but not least this is one
of their newest products
it's the bali body shimmering body oil
this stuff is so freakin pretty your
great select photo shoots great for a
night out great for events like I said
it will nourish your skin smooth your
skin and give it that beautiful bronzy
glow which is what we want right you
want to look healthy I feel like you
can't go wrong with bronzed skin because
it always just makes you look healthy
that is pretty much all about that
little beauty still step by my world
when I say this is my favorite product
like I have been using this every single
day it literally just works so well for
my skin it's all I wore in Bali like I
didn't actually wear any makeup I swore
that and binah mascara and I was right
to guard all these products are super
lightweight it doesn't feel like you
have anything on your skin i purse
we hate feeling sticky and I hate
feeling like a half a town on oh and by
the way I forgot to mention this is the
perfect in between a lip balm and a lip
gloss anyway I will leave a poly buddies
