turning not even kidding it is a
freaking good product I would buy these
over in sellin parks any day it is so
amazing
I need them to make a perfume of this
scent and call it fudge blonde sky
beauty because this is my favorite thing
in the world as of now you should have
seen how yellow and my hair was before
it has come out such a nice blonde it
feels like I just went to the
hairdresser and had my hair turned it
works not frickin good and it smells
that freaking good okay you hit me when
I talk to you okay let's move on so
after I wash my hair with that if that
wasn't enough I also purchased this muck
blonde mop treating mark treating masks
and I put a bit of that in my hair also
and this also smells so good but this is
more number one this is my number one
product now okay I love you you be in my
life forever boo and you guys if you are
blonde this which I thought that was
worn it you know when you bring stuff
out from the shower and I was like were
in the couch
tape and okay that will change your life
start cheap 20 bucks each
bargain I love a bargain after I did dot
I put a bit of this through my hair I've
been using this for probably about a
year now and it is so amazing it's just
a serum to contain the frizz my hair so
frizzy as you can see I need product in
my hair like I'm such a product freak
anyway I'm rambling way too much I
promised myself I wouldn't do that let's
get straight into trying these products
what I'm going to do is try to blow dry
out first
I never know make splurge on iron huh
just because I go to the hairdresser's
I'll watch but let's see how the scars
it's not if anyone else does their hair
at home and it softer and your hair dry
off then let's see how this goes put
your hands up you will under arrest okay
so it comes with your novel like so
around and I would play that would go
let's say that way this is the on button
and then you flip that one up to make
the heat go
okay I cannot blow-dry my half a
okay oh I forgot to put hair protector
and let's do that what I have the heat
protectant Papes you know why because we
don't want fizzles little mullets trust
me I've been there I've done that it's
not something you want to experience you
know are you feel me okay good so take
care of your hair maybe lay off the
bleach and if you're going to bleach it
like me because you're just a natural
blonde and you want to have fun you need
to use all put
my arm is dying how do people do this
seriously who does this every day oh my
god what is something here okay let's
fix up this hairdryer is amazing so far
that little Bob flick thing going on
that's good all right
I have feels so soft after using nice
products seriously and that probably the
oil treatment now if you're going to put
oil treatments in your hair and you are
blonde you want to look for like white
oils rather than yellow oils because
obviously it will make your hair go
yellow and we don't yellow
how's that pot looking is it looking
is it is it looking good looking I just
um
I love having colleagues it's just it's
really good you know oh my god is this
for real yes that's a yes from me it's a
yes from D code and there's also yes
from Jessie J as well so you're going
through to the next round thank you very
much for coming so as I needed a little
break a food break this you need to try
what I've done it's frozen an up and
guard so now it's like a little I found
quite a number of movies matching frozen
thousand thousand what do you like to
eat my god
I don't even know her you know what I
mean and she just like interrupt me all
the time and it's like I don't know you
leave me alone stop stalking me I've
chosen that and it's like a little ice
cream it's so good let's try this little
bad boy how cute are these they're blue
so cute
I just smell everything okay so let me
read you the box it says natural
negative ions breakdown water clusters
into tiny water molecules are ionized
water molecules penetrate hair deeper
and faster for extreme hydration far
infrared energy smooth hair from the
inside out
Hera's left hydrated smooth and shiny so
what I gather is that this is supposed
to be treating your hair while it's
treating it
yep I'm pretty sure that's a thing
nowadays holy crap that heats up so fast
it goes up to 210 yeah 210 degrees
Celsius extra third
the currents trip for three times
through the head true boy sure with my
excited let's cord okay ready
hang on oh my god that straightened so
well my hair feels so good but that's
good that it straightens in one go you
don't want to be going over your hair
too many times because that's what ruins
it
how's the back going good is it straight
you see the difference the difference
that is freakin amazing for like that is
a whole lot of good quality oh my gosh a
Jay King can you oh holy crap I love
this thing it's actually better than the
GHD that is messed up like so good look
at the difference
am I done boom at some range turn this
off which is right here just a little on
and off button that did not take me long
at all just took half the time of what
it would normally take me straight in my
head overall I would rate this product a
8.5 out of 10 okay I'm not Delta today
I'm dick hard and I'm writing it it
heats up really really quickly so it's
great if you're in a hurry it's a really
convenient tool I liked the head dry out
true let's be honest see if you have to
lean up myself everyday I usually just
like style my hair I go to the
hairdresser's get them to stall it and
I'll leave it for a week I won't need to
wash it because I'm blonde it doesn't
really get that Whaley sorry that's
amazing for me anyway I have come to the
