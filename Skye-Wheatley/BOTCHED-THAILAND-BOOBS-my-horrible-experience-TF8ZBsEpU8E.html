duty chokes holy crap fuck
procrastination was just sorry wrong on
so many levels I've been sitting here
for three hours on snapchat
procrastinating okay sorry in all
seriousness this is my Thailand boob job
video I'm going to be sharing my
experience with you guys now the reason
why is it taking me so long to film this
video was because number one I was not
happy with him at all number two I
couldn't tell anyone that I wasn't happy
with him because I was under contract
I'm sorry two people take the thing I'm
very popular I forgot what I was saying
but anyway I will start from the
beginning okay after I've gotten out of
the Big Brother house my friend Mel had
just come back from Thailand and had her
boobs on she said she had a good
experience blah blah blah
she was good friends with the girl who
did all the marketing and stuff for many
makeovers which is the company that I
went through so she was talking to the
woman that did all the marketing I won't
say names for medi makeovers and she
said to my friend Mel hey listen I've
got a great idea
let's get Skye to come over to Thailand
get Oh boobs done complimentary and
we'll do a contra do so contra duel is
basically where I repay them but not
with money so my repayments were doing
the posting for them and well and
getting them good exposure if you follow
me you would have seen that I had done
so many posts for Eddie makeovers but oh
yeah baby dick yeah I did hits the post
for Betty Marie covers blah blah blah so
that's why they had done the surgery
complimentary they flew me over there
they got Daily Mail involved they came
and you know documented the whole
experience surgery I went over there
thinking everything was rainbow
move chocolate whatever a unicorn um I
didn't do my research I didn't think
that anything could go wrong and I'm a
really really naive person I think
everything is perfect in the world I
don't watch the news
I don't read into negativity I don't
read into negative situations I'm just a
really happening positive person and I
believe that other people are how I am
which is like loyal genuine caring
loving at that point in time I didn't
think anything would go wrong felt
really excited about going over there
and having brand new boobs
the reason why I wanted my boobs done
was because my natural breasts were a
whole cup size different my left boob
was a c-cup and my right boob was like
an a-cup had my consultation was it a
day before surgery or yeah yeah a day
before surgery so they put a drip in
your hand went into the consultation
they put the implants in your clothes
you try them on you test sizings
or that I don't know even what sizes are
I think they're Rd they look like double
D's but I'm pretty sure they're Rd this
breast my left breast
is a is 350 CC the right is 425 CC now I
know when the doctor said okay this this
is what I'm going to do I'm going to put
350 CC in your left and for 25 cc in
your right I just looked at him and went
that's a massive difference I can
understand that my natural breasts are
get quite different but that seems very
freakin extreme I just basically said
you know what you're the doctor you know
what you're doing
no he fucking didn't I said you you know
what you're doing that's fine I trust
you I trusted him I put my fucking body
and just my life pretty much in his
hands and said yeah okay cool I don't
recommend going overseas because one you
have your
consultation a day before you get your
surgery done that is the biggest nono on
this planet Earth
you don't do that you want to you want
to have second opinions you want to go
to hit plenty of different doctors to
know that you're a hundred percent okay
you're a hundred percent confident in
that doctor I just wish that I'd done
research I wish that I had gone and seen
a doctor here in Australia before I went
over to Thailand that happened went into
surgery and this is what I could
remember I remember laying on the bed
being wheeled into the surgery room and
I just got really really nervous right
before they pushed me into the room I
just kept saying symmetrical symmetrical
make symmetrical perfect make
symmetrical make perfect please because
that's the reason why one of my boobs
done I wanted them to be symmetrical I
wanted to have the different sizes
corrected my doctor came over up and I
looked up at him and I said make me
symmetrical make me perfect please are
you confident and he laughed he smiled
he said yes okay boom I got knocked out
and then I woke up from surgery in I kid
you not so much pain like I was not
expecting the amount of pain that I felt
it was really overwhelming it was very
hard to breathe I felt like a massive
truck had been dropped on my chest I was
like screaming for painkillers
I just thought get me drugs and you have
this little buzzer thing right next to
your bed if you need a nurse if you need
a nurse or whatever so I was like
frantically pressing the buzzer on my
mic looks like this pain is stupid I
stayed in the hospital for a couple
nights I could not move I don't even
know how I slept it finally came to the
day where the doctor came and took my
tubes out because I had like two
oops under here oh okay this is the
worst part okay so he comes in and then
unwraps me and then start thanking the
courts like pulling the cord out and I'm
like screaming crying like ooh what is
happening there's a cookie troop coming
out of my body and the doctors just
yanking it out like normal like what's
for dinner got up out of bed went to
look into the mirror and my boobs didn't
even look like boobs they were just like
two massive melons and they came up to
about like here like nearly touching my
nose and if that wasn't bad enough there
was a massive lump in my right boob
because I like mass perfectionistic and
something's not perfect
oh you're dead dead so I looked in the
mirror massive lump and I just turned to
him and I said um what is this what is
this tell me what what is he doing or
what is it Olympia tell me right now
Marco or I will shoot you anyway so he
was like oh that's fine it will go away
with massage after one month now I have
a bad memory but I clearly remember him
telling me one month so I massaged my
boobs frantically every day like when I
got home even straight after like when
they were really really sore
i massage them every day I wore this
really ugly grandma compression bra it's
so ugly it's like you can't wait
anything with it just like a mass
grandma bra with like a zip here you can
just wear sports bras the exact same
thing don't let them try to tell you
different okay and after a month lump
wasn't gone so I called the company I'm
like um sorry the lumps not gone they
try to blame everything on me saying
that I didn't do um what I was told to
do
I didn't massage every day
I didn't buy the compression bra every
day and it's like oh that's really cute
have you got cameras on my fucking head
following me around for you know what I
do 24 hours of the day no sorry you
don't so I went and got a second opinion
I went and said what's wrong with my
boobs
he didn't even really say much he just
looked at both my boobs and said they've
been done wrong they both need to come
out and duck they both need to be done
again they quoted me $14,000 went back
to many makeovers and said this is what
another doctor has said it's not due to
me not massaging and wearing the
compression well what are you going to
do about it then they said you can come
back over to Thailand and have it done
but you'll have to pay for it dying so I
was just like oh my god what a mess what
have I gotten myself into
this is stupid why would I want to go
back to the same doctor that asked my
boobs up in the first place I swear he
was like training or something and you
know what else annoys me is the amount
of girls who've gone through them
because of me because of my promotion
that I did for them on my social media
is a joke like so many girls have gone
through them Colome and they still
couldn't fix it for me like they
couldn't help me they were no help
whatsoever that's a thing like if you go
overseas you can't go for check-ups your
doctor can't you know he's not there
he can't help you they don't care once
you're done and out you're nothing to
them that you're done you're nothing
true that by will to see to other
doctors in Sydney they have identified
what's wrong with my right right boob
and that is double bubble so I have
something that's called double bubble
it's when the old breast tissue
and the implant don't merge I'll just
show you I'll show you photos so
basically now I have to fork out a heap
of money to get them fixed and plus it's
going to be 10 times harder than what it
would have been had I not have gone to
Thailand and had some doctor complicate
my breast area even more so now it's a
more complicated surgery for another
surgeon stream that's why I wish I wish
I wish I wish that I had gone here and
done my research and had more than one
doctor look at my breasts let's show you
these photos of my boobs my right boob
now is so much bigger than my left boob
my left boob is like saggy
sorry bad this robot I can't even
explain you there feed me Rudra's pull
her hi so this is I'll read you one
another doctor said plastic surgeon and
breast augmentation specialist dr. Craig
Rubenstein steamed from these pictures
it looks like a severe and classic case
of double bubble and the right breast is
significant significantly larger yes I
would need to see her first but I would
probably take the implant out try to
repair the infirmary in infirmary crease
let it settle and then start again in
six to 12 months time hmm this is really
this is a really difficult case and it
may not be fixable we can help make the
outcome better but we might not be able
to make them perfect yeah and that's
what the doctor in Sydney told me and
believe me I have cried over this and I
know like first of all problems I'm not
dying but it's my body and
I am such a perfectionist it just kills
me like it's really sad now I've got
this ongoing problem but to be honest I
wish I just left my boobs how they were
so that's what they were before and
that's what they are now hmm so ugly oh
my god so yeah can you see that little
lump there that's the double bubble see
how like with my old boob that's like
the old group sitting on top of the
implant he just did the worst job ever
like well did you even study what
practice did you learn up because you
need to go back to school go like next
level not okay ah look if you have any
more questions comment below I'll be
happy to answer them for you and I'm
definitely going to vlog my next boob
job experience so if anyone else has the
same problem and they want to go to the
same doctor as me if it does a good job

happy to share with you my experience so
