didn't want to come behind but I'm high
oh hi everyone
what is it hurt right what is the
possible journey why yes hi is the
bumper fascia to another my honey
hey are you picking your ovaries today
Oh
so Kim and I went grocery shopping and
we've decided we want to pig out and
it's going to be my last day I'm doing
it for they do this thing on YouTube
where they count their calories and
people have been eating like ten tails
of color that's all we've got babe
where's the other bag
what on oh here they are okay so I'm
going to enter all the food in that I
eat and I ate a few things at the shops
already through so I'm going to enter
everything in and then calculate it in
my fitness path and let you guys know
how much I consume
okay so cams having a chicken sandwich
I'm having Jack's quick with triple
cream brie cheese hello everybody so
yesterday I didn't finish my blog and I
didn't show you how many calories I
consumed which was like a disgusting
amount
I've just been picking out really badly
lately and it's really not good but ever
since I went to Bali I've just come back
and I just I just want to eat everything
before I went to Bali I was cooking
flora good I was exercising every day I
was following my plan like my eating
plan and I felt bored bored and now I'm
in the habit where I'm eating badly and
eating whatever I want every day which
is sore not good I don't know how to
break the habit I guess I just have to
put my mind to it and step set some
goals and just push through the first
two days or going back to healthy eating
because that's all it takes
once you're on a roll you're on a roll
but once you're on a roll of eating junk
food you're also on a roll you're on a
really bad roller coaster and you need
to get off that roll Preston so anyway
I'll tell you what the calories came to
with what I had yesterday
I had a chocolate croissant which was
182 calories I had a bluesy drink which
was 147 calories I had cheese triple
cream brie cheese which was 140 calories
just click from on it I had about five I
had more than five biscuits but 550 it
comes to 221 calories that's a lot then
I had a chocolate and Nutella snack
which was 248 calories who was gone and
then for dinner I had dairy milk with
Oreo that whole block I ate the whole
block like what is wrong with me iron
but is that whole book of chocolate was
907 calorie holy jesus I also had I had
vaginal two slices of turkey spread
which is 160 calories with hot chicken
58 calories mozzarella cheese 20 grams
50 calories whole egg mayor 20 grams 144
so my dinner came to 1319 calories and
I'm only supposed to be consuming 1,500
calories a day so I pretty much ate all
my calories and didn't time but
yesterday including like everything that
I ate came to 480 thousand what's on the
books 3275 and I went over my calories
