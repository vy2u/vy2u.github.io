some more of this on my brush and your
skirt or if off my red bottle lid with
that I just feel like a girl to go down

sometimes mole makeup can make you look
old up and
oh look younger and then I'm gonna get a
smaller brush and just take that
underneath my eyes whenever someone
tries to talk to me about time and like
getting old off I literally just shot
them down straight away because I just
can't talk about it I literally can't
talk about it because it scares me like
you know how people have phobias of
spiders and like snakes so what about I
have a phobia of getting old and it's a
real thing like I'm literally
myself I just I just don't want to get
old

stay 23 forever no name I'm gonna use a
little bit of blush this is my favorite
thing from Napoleon
