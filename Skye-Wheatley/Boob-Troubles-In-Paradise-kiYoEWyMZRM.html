be a pleasant thing I'm gonna put this
camera right here cuz it's breaking my
arm it's never going to be a pleasant
experience for me like normally when you
go to see a boob doctor you feel
feelings of excitement and joy and
happiness because you you have in your
mind a picture of what your outcome will
be and then you usually get that outcome
and you're really happy with it most of
the time for me mine was just like I
couldn't have had any lower expectations

been it's been hell and even the
aftermath of it has been even worse and

fixers today's class Oh

just a headache and I just get really
down about it like once I'm feeling
