I couldn't even think properly like I
was just really nervous
what did I think though when I got into
the car I don't know her I was just like
oh he looks just like his photos which
is good some people don't and what else
I don't know it's just like super
nervous I couldn't even think I was just
like thinking of things to say after
I've said wait how can I explain this
design accent do you think sister while
I was talking that's why I meant to say
yeah I need to talk with God that was
like full gym junkie work shut off
typified on a mirror
oh my god I'm not into that yes
no I'm not as I all right sir I just
knew you sort of into that sort of Seine
and then um so I'm just a big concern
about dating I remember the first time
when I picked you up we got out of the
car and you go oh my god boy you need to
go fucking ten years obey students a
girl in Germany fucks off his face
it's our first date was that the grand
which is I wasn't a dialer I'll just
pick you up without coming back from
working I was okay wasn't a date so good
day to actually like comfortable with I
took you on a date but pretty much a way
back that well make sure that was not a
week after home that's probably a month
or two because she was playing the whole
friends thing with his best friends and
all that stuff and then yes as far as
pretty much she's acting like she just
won't be friends I was gone
and it was really awkward it wasn't
awkward at all very well laughing well
laughing the whole time we were having
fun but I'd like say something to him
and then this is what he doing he'd go
like this no because always when
everyone and like look out to the
distance on my okay you're just on him -
Helen I didn't know what he was thinking
like interested or what the fuck was
going on I felt awkward at some point
and then once we had a few drinks we
were like feeling more comfortable room
boy that's right an inside pretty much
half of the first drinks like I couldn't
say so we'll have this drink named Lydia
I say I think she had been we had like
three she had three of our last night
throwing beers and she goes okay so
we'll have this drink never late okay so
I was like all right she's not into me
at all let's get the fuck out of you
let's ditch me what you said everyone
yeah but I wanted you to be like no yeah
I'm having fun but if you said oh let's
have another drink
what let's have this drinking in life

I didn't even know Olivia threatened
when are you thinking of proposing we
need wedding photos eyes up is this
where you have the tweakin boys I
personally can't see because it's not
like I'm not gonna answer this question
because whatever clear advertising that

about wasn't she's gonna expect it
obviously I don't want to know when
you're going through it yeah I don't
even really care
oh actually how long have we been
together I've give you only been
together for six month seven months yeah
we've only been together for seven
months I'm like not really expecting
anything but if we if I was with the
guys like four for four years and he
hadn't proposed to me yeah I'd be
offended so just I think anything after
a year yeah anything inside of a year or
two yeah yeah after you but definitely

that it was just you know anyone know oh
so you were looking after me yeah
whatever thing I thought that's what you
said okay so you were doing it because
you didn't want to leave me alone I need
you worried and because you thought your
massive fire in the trunk about inspire
a bird a bird inspir name some pet
peeves that Lachlan does Hey nevermind

your said don't do this like annoying I
always tell you how annoying you I bet
they're poking all I can say because I
that's why
when I make little comments and I've
done anything's gonna be bad look the
offensive if I say Oh something and you
get really offended to imply that he's
the one who has to do everything when
like when I actually do most of it like

hypocrite
