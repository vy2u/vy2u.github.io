Potter anyway today I'm going to be
doing a review on this new charcoal mask
and this cold sushi bubble choco bong
goo goo
so this is a charcoal sheet mask oh my
god it contains choco which is like the
coolest looking thing because brownie
choco is the I ignore that taco it
is very good for my things like
lightening your teeth hydrating the skin
I don't let's rate the back see what it
says revive your skin without clinically
derived cleansing bubble formula the
self activated charcoal bubbles
penetrate deep into the poles it removes
any impurities promotes blood
circulation and stimulates cell turnover
for a through de and brought on
complexion that is actually what I need
I am pretty keen to try this busy choc
whole face mask so let's read the
instructions wash base Tarly yup done
that and dry to full application unfold
the mask a just mask on face aligned
with eyes and mouth leave on for 5 to 8
minutes to allow bubbles to sleeve form
remove shape mask and gently massage
your skin with the remaining bubbles
rinse off with cold water okay cool
sounds good so the packaging is
definitely Fuji very fun you know what I
mean just how I like it
it comes with three shapes sorry three
mosques I wonder if you can reuse them
probably not probably not the most
hygienic
changer but anyway sky Wheatley take it
to the next level with shape
oh there is lot of gel in here Wow
alright
got a lot of product in the bag you can
probably reuse the leftover product
that's in here without the mask inner if
you
some extra hydration has a cut on my
thumb because I attempted to cook
something yesterday and I cut my thumb
on a tin leet literally like it wasn't
even a knife hey so this is what the
mosque looks like and say it's not
really fresh like actually comments on
food okay so here it goes and put it on
it's very cold
oh so cold so cold so cold so you want
to make sure that is covering your face
just fold out yeah doctor there yeah
there we go oh oh now we're talking
hello Frank Walker national title mmm so
I'm just going to Nassau it's the rest
of the problem I think is on to my neck
because why not
it's gotta be good for you right oh it's
Pauline
can you see you but am I supposed to be
messaging you I don't think so I think
you meant to massage it after you take
it off oh my god it feels amazing yeah
okay I'm gonna throw a summary net just
let that do its thing so it says to
leave it on for five to eight minutes
let's put the timer on whereas my time
on bitch up open your eyes Beach Wow
look at it bubbling like straight away
and it's gonna put the stopwatch on
quickly as you can see it's already
bubbling well that happened really fast
it's like to clean my nerves a little
bit
I look scary Wow really nose bubble
doesn't it very good pretty nice and
make it look scary right now
hi how are you oh look at that
that's so cool that's the way I came out
of firm party right now I should have
dressed up I was like a fun monster for
Halloween you can feel the bubbles
popping on your skin and it kind of
tickles a little and you can hear it
like
laughter atrum to me who me
you wanna look like that to me over
let's go me if you wanted to I guess you
could whack the bubbles away and then
let them work their way to the surface
other seriously have no idea what it's
actually doing until I take the mask off
and look at my skin
I've had no sensitivity or irritation
with this and normally I do because my
screen is stupid some things so I have
to be really careful about what I'm
using
I'm going to take this off now and see
how my skin feels what Wow look okay
ready see it's a cool firmed up on my
skin wow that feels fresh fresh fresh oh
I knew it I put this oh we alluded
so I'm just gonna massage dot into my
skin my neck

water and I'll be right back so you guys

when it's all fresh and clean and
doesn't look like just another firm body
