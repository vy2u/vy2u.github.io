learned to never
cuz I'm done cleanup found myself in my
little strong
I'm too
hey guys welcome back to my channel it's
got movie we say sky will be with the
hey
holy it just gets more weird every
time doesn't it
I'm not normal and it'll cheer up anyway
I have created it this a beautiful
maroon smokey eye and maroon lit for you
guys because I was super inspired by
this beautiful outfit that I bought from
sister's label I have a discount code
for you guys if you are looking into
buying and use these outfits from
sister's label they have the most
stunning stuff and I feel like it's
perfect for formal grad date night
whatever it may be I will link all the
information as to where I got this
beautiful outfit down below in the
description and on the screen here for
you guys
I hope you enjoy this makeup tutorial
and let's get into it
boom right Lego Lego level Oh No hey hey
it's 7j not really its ride a sir guys
I've already started with my brows done
because I feel like everyone on the
internet knows how to do that browns I
mean come on how many YouTube is all
that how many beauty gurus all that out
there
the answer is a fuckload so I'm sure we
know how we like to fill our browsing
what I used in my brows that's what I
always use and so now I should switch up
the products you stitch a little bit for
you guys but to be honest makeups
 expensive and I'm not about to
go searching in that pocket for the
moolah to go spend on more makeup
because I have a fuckload of makeup and
shiny and Michael just gave me so much
makeup so I'm making it work that's me
done I don't need any more makeup I'm
content
I'm just filled I'm happy with my makeup
collection I know my brow
in with the Estacio brow powder doer in
the color soft brown and then I just
called them out with foundation which is
just the foundation that I'm going to be
using on my skin and that is not there's
a bit that's a good that I just want to
fill in II let me give me let me give me
let me get the good who says my eyelids
I'm just going to be using the Australis
or some bullets Wow
hope you guys don't mind that I use the
same cross every time I'm just using my
favorite props but you know what like
when I was first into YouTube
you know I would watch different people
and you know want to create books that
they created but they would do it with
different makeup every time and I'm like
bitch welcome glad I have enough money
to afford all those palettes no I do not
at least with my tutorials you know I'll
be using the same shape so if you want
to go buy the same we can both use
the same together why not use the
same if it's working out for your
ship I'm using same old same old
pretty Beauty rose gold position palette
because the outfit that I wanted to
match this makeup look with is
absolutely stunning and the color of it
it's just speaking to me and every
single different language and in every
single way so I'm gonna roll with that
color of the dress and I'm gonna match
it to my makeup so the crease color I'm
going to grow thanks for going with
sandalwood and I'm just going to take
duck holes for my crease okay so once
we've taken back all through the crease
I'm going to go in with the color pinup
and just alter take that through the
crease with a fluffy blending brush come
get to know me
feel free to love me feel free to hate
me
so once that is done I'm going to pick
up a different brush oh okay
this is literally my favorite brush ever
it's the math true through nine brush
literally the best brush for picking up
product and I also known to be pigmented
but you have to have a good brush to
pick up the actual product this brush
picks up every Tom Dick and Harry and
it's amazing
Tom Dick and Harry you wanna ride well I
got you with mom map to three numbers
okay so with that I'm just going to show
you the color I'm using man a dog and
I'm just going to pack that color all
over my mobile lid like sorry oh I'm
gonna go in with the color Buffy pick it
up on the same brush that we just used
and pack it on the outer corner on we
leave yes way me
yeah old and play me where are the whips
like I need the whips cuz you're
literally like sling my existence right
now feels so good okay so after we've
done that we're going to go vacuum with
Tina and just go back to our crease or
not fluffy brush just to blend that
allowed oh I love doing some right here
eyes cuz then just start easy smack it
on the lid and it's done you know what I
mean I'm all about that okay so really
clean fluffy brush I'm just going to
blend all that out oh this is a pimple
by the way that was I will know a crusty
book blackness well I know I'm going to
be using the Maybelline eye studio I'm
tipsy to just FYI
actually no yeah I am
oh girl why
look how weird like I'm a couple
foundation I am going to be using my
origins ginseng star I do have
extensions on at the moment but I always
put my scar over them I've got a lot of
comments in the last my tutorial I did
asking how to remove my scar from
eyelash extensions and if you actually
could wear scar with eyelash extensions
I really feel like mascara effects your
eyelash extensions especially if you're
using origins ginseng scar
it's literally of godsend when I get in
the shower I just I don't even have to
touch my face it just comes straight off
with water sorry yeah I'm just suggest
not using a waterproof mascara if you
have lash extensions I wouldn't suggest
using eye makeup remover around the eye
like I never vigorously rub my lash
extensions yeah this one's too old I
need to get them raised over I'm getting
the Marin field to Mars or because of
that I'm going to be using falsies and
these falsies ah there's the packet for
him laughs Bob and these are actually my
own design through this company these
are literally my favorite style they're
so crispy and natural and I just love
them all so that's so so easy to apply
it's a joke the lecture they so
perfect is absolutely a godsend from
heaven above like honestly these lashes
can literally me up the ass I'm
sleeping oh sorry inappropriate age
sorry um cannot walk while putting
lashes all unarmed

be using scary a radiance primer
