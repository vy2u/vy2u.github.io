it's Skye will really make into a leader
I've created this it was supposed to be
my everyday look but it turned into
something a little bit more extra was
just playing around because I hadn't
done makeup in so long and I actually
realized how much I missed doing my
makeup I don't really go out I'm a bit
of a none of these days so yeah I don't
tend to glam myself up very often so
yeah I really miss that I also wanted to
show you guys what some of the sample
lashes that I got looked like on the
eyes with different eye makeup looks let
me know if you guys like these lashes
I'm definitely really in love yeah I'm
obsessed with them so definitely be
getting these in but I still would like
to know what you guys think of them all
sorry let me know what you think of this
makeup tutorial and if you want to see
more makeup tutorials don't forget to
tell them this video right up and
subscribe to my channel so you never
miss another video with Skye no really
yay alright let's get straight into the
video not enjoy it so I just quickly
sprayed my face with some of this just
to turn and hydrate and then I went in
with this moisturizer just to obviously
I drew it my face before we go and put
the base and everything else on it's
really important to keep your face
hydrated otherwise the makeups not going
to look good I'm going to use this matte
lip scrub on my lip because this super
dry at the moment winter gets me good
over time every year that tastes so good
alright the first things I'm going to be
using on my face is the Skinner 2 BB
mineral foundation I kind of use this as
a primer I've also got sunscreen in it
he's probably thinking girl you need to
stop putting sunscreen on your face
because it's not white but definitely
had my fair share of Sun on my face
sometimes it's nice to give the skin a
break from the Sun it is very aging and
very damaging
I don't know if I'm ready to conquer the
wing today you know what I mean I just
don't nor if I'm up for it
oh and by the way I'm using a stippling
brush to apply this now I'm going to do
my eyebrows all zoom you in flat so
first I'm going to just brush them out
I'm not going to go overboard on them or
am i I don't have my makeup here and
that lock right here obviously I live
here but all my makeups at mums
so I'm going to be using a my Anastasia
brow powder duo in the color soft brown
yeah I live here now but all my makeups
at Mom's house you know how it is girl
oh my god I literally haven't filmed a
makeup tutorial in the longest time I
hadn't had my makeup at Lucky's for the
longest time and I was getting my room
sir so much has been happening so much
has been going on and I can share
everything with you guys doing and I'm
really excited it's been really hard for
me not to talk about this I'm not a very
private person you guys are gonna lose
your gonna lose your fear oh and
I'm also excited because in today's
video I'm going to use the lashes the
lash samples that I've got sent to me
for my own lush range last range lash
friend you guys would have to definitely
give your feedback on the lashes I'm
going to just clean the brows up I'm
going to using the colour-pop no filter
concealer also guy the mostess makeup
I've never used before
and then obviously contribute the rest
of the product onto my eyelid so I'm
just going to blend that out I'm using
my Huxley brush looks just like a
concealer brush I love this brush for
like blending out concealer on my eyes
and anywhere else that it is all right
there you go okay so now we want to set
our eyelids and for that I'm going to be
using any young blood mineral cosmetics
palettes just with a fluffy brush I'm
just going to get a skin tone color set
that down I'm going to use another
Huxley brush it's just like a fluffy
blending brush I'm going to be going in
with the true face and natural matte
look at me okay so I'm just going to be
taking the color honey Buttle top on
there and just taking it through my
crease thanks Jeremy well babe my
eyelids are getting like saggy it's
sorry bad I don't know why it's gotta be
the Sun all right so once we've done
that I'm going to go in with the color
chocolate cookie and I'm just going to
darken that color up through the crease
so I'll placing it in the same place
that we place up a whole lot of coal up
if you find that there's like a harsh
line between your crease and like your
eyebrow we need to do is get like a
fluffy brush that doesn't have any
product on it and just go over that
and continue to blend honestly you guys
blending is so important and it's also
very time-consuming all right so I'm
going to go in with another color just
to keep on darkening that crease color
I'm going to using this color here
coming um
building on that crease color now I'm
going to get a small brush I'm going to
pick up maybe still days true I'm going
to mix these two colors together and
just place it right the ones of my eyes
just like slap it on like get a good
amount of it
 always use the same colors darn I
just gonna bring that through the crease
as well just with the excess product on
my brush sorry Mac sent me this palette
queen supreme I'm thinking about this
one of this one start with the different
brush again
well it might add but it brush the
babies eat it don't know how to work
without it
here it is so I'm gonna be using my Mac
239 brush this thing is looking amazing
at picking up product
place it and what
I'm going to go back in with this little
doorknob and just get cut off some young
and justify that in in with my I like

like freaking out

going to be using my all-time favorite
and literally you don't need anything
other than this

makeup in the longest time but we're on
it to the base so for the base I'm going
to be using my all-time favorite I

color 16 and three or one for sure looks
like super empty yep

on my lips
all right so every lip liner I'm going
to be using kylie jenner in color crack
