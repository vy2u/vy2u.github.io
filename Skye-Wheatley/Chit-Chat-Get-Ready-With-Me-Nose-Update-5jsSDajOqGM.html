channel it's Scott Murray ways that Oh
Scott Murray wait right in today's video
I would be creating if this look for you
guys
would you say it's natural would you I'm
gonna call it not true because it's
fairly natural I find it's not true it's
not true for me it's natural okay it's
like a warm natural glam and makeup look
okay so if you like this makeup look
then just keep on watching
but before we jump into the video I want
to share with you guys this really cool
website that I found
it's called Bacardi and it's basically a
website with a bunch of different
coupons that you can find for Black
Friday tomorrow Black Friday's like this
huge shopping event and if you love
shopping just as much as me then you
will love it this website start I will
link that in the description down below
and make sure you check it out there's
literally coupons for absolutely
anything and everything anything you
love and anything that you want a
discount on it'll be there okay and you
can thank me Lena okay alright let's get
started
alrighty so I'm going to be starting
this look with my brother already done I
just use the Anastacio powder doer and
this is in the color soft brown and then
I just used the Atlanta color then it
should carve out my brows I used the Naz
soft matte complete concealer in the
color medium one and now we are going to
be moving on to the eyes so I'm a little
bit tired
because I really want to create a makeup
look using the hooter Beauty rose gold
edition palette I haven't been able to
successfully use any of the shimmery
colors on my eyelids as of yet because
like I said the brush does just not pick
up the product now that I have short
nails I was like okay you know what I'm
gonna try using the shimmery colors and
just create a really natural soft but
glam makeup look I've already tested a
little bit of it on my eye and it does
seem to go on much better when you use
your finger I haven't actually set my
eyes I've just left them as is when I
say that I mean with like a pad off
because I really want these colors to
graft or I'm just going to go straight
in with the color trust funds oh shoot
all across my motherland
Holi pigment Holi pigment oh my god wow
that is so pigmented I feel like it's
more of a cream thing rather than like a
dry eye shadow definitely works so much
better when you use your finger Wow look
at that that's crazy
alright so I'm just gonna clean that up
a little bit that's falling out
underneath my eye I'm going to go in
through my crease with henna you know
you know hey well wish me luck
and just take it through the crease okay
so once that is done I'm going to pick
up a little bit of a pick up blending
brush and I'm going to go in with the
color sandalwood blend all that do we
got this I don't know I just don't let
anyone down you're like I just don't
want it to look bad I just want it to
look good and pretty and natural okay
think that looks okay then I'm going to
go back in with the color you know and
just darken up the outer corners right
here
I don't know you guys don't really know
about the shimmery colors same sort of
lost pigment already but being on the I
don't know how I'm feeling I just I
don't very yet okay what's been off
what's been happening with you guys I
have been really good I think I'm like
full star stressed about all the weight
like I've just been in thir stressed out
this week and it's because I know if I'm
booked back-to-back with formal clients
and I'm just like holy
are you ready for this like it's going
to be hectic you know I don't know I
just feel the pressure you know what I
mean wow I can breathe
I've already moisturized my face with
some vitamin B cream I'm just going to
use a little bit of that so that we are
nicely primed all right so full base I'm
going to be using the nos matte
foundation stick and this is in the
color bottle or not medium for I'm not
going to put a lot of this on because I
do really want this makeup to stay
natural that's not a lot of makeup for
me sir that's a lot of makeup for you
girl you are
natural son of a bitch okay just make it
look flawless fresh and flawless anyway
what has been happening with me I have
been really really happy I've been going
to the gym I've been just like really
different like it's crazy what happens
when you just get rid of one toxic thing
in your life like it just comes around
everything gets so much that are
different people look at your life
better people people that uplift you
instead of bringing you down yeah
seriously that's good I've been going
through f45 and I seriously love it so I
watch I go with Bella and I'm pretty
sure she's loving it as well the bonus
are you guys like exercise really close
your mindset it's crazy I just feel so
much happier and in a better mind state
now that I like get off but I exercise
and my body is like yeah I love you
you're amazing you're treating me well
author I've been seeing this new guy and
I'm pretty sure he's like pretty amazing
I don't want to talk too soon we can
send I'll make me look like an idiot
I don't know reject me or anything
anything can happen you know these days
in this world already and now that we've
got a stripper last natural based on I'm
just going to go in with some concealer
and if it can still out I'm going to be
using the NARS soft matte complete
concealer in the color medium one
custard
wow you guys like really need to get
better I try to read the names out cuz
they're honestly suck yeah but yeah suck
it oh my god so I'm just going to be
using a little bit of that oh that's a
wall
to use that where I need it which is
like not many places because I'm like
honestly perfect jokes don't ever
complain yourself to anyone else even
though I know that's really hard not to
because obviously we were brought up in
a world that everyone's perfect in
apparently but just remember that's not
reality
back to real loot right now I need
powder so for powder I'm going to be
using straw fresh and flawless and this
is in the color dark brown this is my
natural tan and as you brow I'm proud oh
my god you up make you said to me the
other day say you know everybody have
grandma hands on my wife you guys could
you lay in the Sun like that is true
that is extremely true
Wow this powder is really high coverage
okay well I feel they just think I'm
faded they're not true it's not true why
oh my god it is it doesn't even
match holy laughter can you got
this this is a cute little trick that I
have if you have any freckles or beauty
marks that you want us to be seen and
you don't want to be covered up with the
makeup all you have to do is get some
makeup remover on a little what do you
call things I don't give but earbuds and
just worse is that yeah okay wherever
your beauty marks are just remove the
makeup you see I really don't know if I
like the look of power anymore you know
what I mean I think I should've just
left it juhi put some brother on cuz I
feel like I look like death all right
surfer bronze I'm going to be using
hoola runs off as well as the L'Oreal
True Match I'm gonna mix the two
together because this is a little bit
more Orange
I don't know if it will match my natural
turn just bit of hair can just leave my
life live my after you gotten an update
on the nose so I got Phillip put in
either side of my nose because I know it
was it was doing something weird okay my
doctor told me and I didn't remember
what he meant or what it meant when he
was timing so he put a little bit of
filling here and a little bit on this
side but not enough it's still gonna
still gonna Denton a start I have to go
and get more filler put in which is like
so annoying but you know what I saw a
few people ask in my comments like I'm
you happy that you've got the nice job
you regret your surgery actually don't
regret my surgery because I'm really
really happy with the way that looks
from John and it is a massive massive
improvement it just need a little bit of
tweaking I think maybe because we try to
fasten the healing process with the
steroid injections maybe not had
something to do with a loss in fact or
tissue or whatever I don't I don't nor
probably should've just waited for the
swelling to come down naturally but me
being me impatient I wanted it to be
perfect straight away and I messed with
it I also have massaged it way too hard
when I was healing like I was very
aggressively pushed down on it I think
I've said that in other videos I don't
know it all so crazy your CD that I
do you know what I'm saying do not
regret my surgery at all because I'm so
much happier with memories now than what
it was so let's do the under eyes now
I'm just going to pick up that same
brush before that we use to darken the
outer corners of our eyes and I'm just
going to use the leftover cotton
brush and just sweep that under my
eyeball video bow SEC but you guys I
don't really feel comfortable with
mining right now because my mum for him
and she literally hated sir ma she's

creep right
