in today's video I'm going to be going
through act apparel which is like a
really high-quality gym wear label they
have some incredible stuff I'm wearing
their sports bra now they have the most
comfortable gym sets you will ever come
across in your life I'm really actually
quite surprised at how the quality was I
was not expecting the quality to be as
high as what it was they're like
literally my new favorite gym wear
apparel because I'm telling you they are
that good and the fabric is insane it's
something that looks incredible on your
body and is super comfortable at the
same time have put on a little bit of
weight so just ignore that I don't I
just like don't care right now like I'm
about to go to max Bernal I don't know I
just you don't you just don't really can
just even out of the fuck you want
that's kind of what I'm doing at the
moment sorry
peace out still obscure out on my body I
feel like that would be flattering for
anyone anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video make sure you give it a big
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel so
you never miss another video with really
enjoy hey guys sorry this is the first
set it's in like kind of a dark blush
color which I absolutely love and I
really loved the little splits for the
cutouts on the side of the leggings I
think it's really flattering let's just
ignore the bloat I would appreciate it I
love that it covers so much of my tosser
I would feel comfortable going in the
gym in this set because it does cover
majority of my stomach
it's got the true black lines here and
they are full length so when amis caught
testing all of these
the lights really shit I'm gonna be
squat testing all of these leggings
because when I look for gym wear active
wear I look for stuff that's super
comfortable to work out in this material
is through / comfortable like I'm very
impressed and they passed the squat test
so you guys can see that for yourself
when I do this core test I'm not too
sure of the names of each should I might
pass because I was doing jump squats I'm
not quite sure of the names of each step
that I have but I will link everything
down in the description below
okay I am seriously Dolph's tested this
one from the color to the fit to the
fabric I love the top is honestly like
the most stunning fabric I've ever felt
honestly it would just be something for
me that I would just throw on to go to
the gym in and I love that all their
types come up to your waist it is
honestly very comfy let's do this for
what
so I cannot explain to you how
comfortable these leggings are I can't
explain this fabric I don't know how to
explain it all I know is that they fit
so perfectly they come up super high
which I love I feel like they would fit
anyone's body I can't find many types
that actually fit me well but these as
soon as I put them on I was like oh my
god they're going to fit me so well I
just got another one of the half crop
top on in black I feel like you always
need black Joomla and like it's
essential
okay this has got to be got to be got to
be one of my faves I'm really obsessed
with cocky sorry I just had to have this
debt all these sports files come with
removable padding to you by the way I
don't know if I mentioned that they're
so comfortable I feel so supported and
these little cutout on the side it gives
me life
I'm literally shocked and how fucking
nice that Jim where is I'm obsessed
okay I'm literally obsessed with dead
you man this is so freaking comfy
you have no idea so I left the padding
in just to show you guys what it looks
like I don't know if you can tell much
difference but Molly girls that have
smaller boobs it would definitely give
you a nice pushup but for me I
personally just take them out because I
don't want my tips to look any bigger
than they are
you know what I mean I love this high
waisted band it like honestly feels so
comfortable and you just feel stars to
cue off
okay guys I'm really not kidding this is
probably my new favorite octave web
brand honestly I just find this so
flattering like even though I put in a
little bit away I still feel very sexy
it's right but the same step we just we
just tried on in this like rosy blush
color which is super beautiful this is
all seamless by the way and I cannot
explain how comfortable each set is like
it seriously just gets better and better
don't mind me being pumpkin I have an
exercise in a while
all right sorry literally dying over
this color it's absolutely stunning all
that stuff is so flattering honestly
couldn't get any better I'm obsessed
with this Jim Webb brand and their gym
stuff is so comfortable so they pretty
much have all the same style and mosa
stuff and just different colors his
tights are the most comfortable thing
I've ever had in my life
oh yeah so that is the end of the hall I
would seriously compare dr. Jim where
two like Jim shock and his such good
quality I'm obsessed with that fabrics
and yeah new fave Jim we're label like I
said a million times anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed that video and I will see
you in my next one
one much love thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
