hi guys and welcome back to my channel
today is very exciting I have to
fullscreen myself a protein shake
because I don't know why but whenever I
know psychologically I'm drinking I
don't feel like eating like at all and
then when I eat I don't feel like
drinking so yeah without having to get
way too drunk by not having food in your
stomach when you drink so I'm going to
be sensible today and make sure I only
have a couple that I've got something in
my stomach anyway today is former it's a
festival in Brisbane this is the makeup
that I'm wearing and I don't know if you
guys so I hope you enjoy this tutorial
this our body chain is from it's so nice
it's from mink collections and this
bralette is from cotton embody and I
just got a wife that I bought from
Universal but yeah hope you enjoy the
video
hey guys so I'm starting off with my
eyebrows already done and check my nails
aren't they so pretty check my Instagram
for details okay so I'm going to be
starting off with whole professional
matte rescue by benefit and I'm just
going to be placing this in the areas
where I get most greasy
and the foundation I'm going to be using
true match as always and it is in the
color 16 and 3:01 I'm just going to
apply that with my damp Beauty Blender
making sure I get the hairline really
well and bringing that on to my ears
down my neck you know the drill okay so
if we can seal out I'm using my nas in
the color medium ginger placing this
under my eyes down the shaft to my
nerves a little bit on my forehead then
blending it right on in so now I'm just
going to set my face with the Rimmel
match perfection I think that's what
it's called
the label has scratched off sir I don't
know and for powder I'll be using my new
band nature this is medium skin tones
yeah it literally just says medium skin
tones on the back of the car bar so
that's the color I use for bronzer I'll
be using hoola by benefit just placing
this on my cheeks around my jawline and
up around my forehead
for Kanto I'll be using my Youngblood
contour palette just with a small fluffy
brush grabbing these three colors and
placing that down either side of my
nerves just to give it that snatched a
set girl
moving on to eyes ivory picking out my
two-faced semi-sweet chocolate bar going
in with the color peanut butter and just
taking that through my crease next you
want to go on with a small fluffy brush
with the color truffle and put that on
the outer corners of your eyes and the
inner corners of your eyes next going in
with the cocoa chili color and just
darkening up the outer and inner corners
of your eyes now what I'm going to do is
get some good a glue from Too Faced with
a flat top brush and just place that in
the middle of my eye where we didn't
place the eyeshadow
so after that I'm going in with my
Napoleon Kurtis loose I dust and this is
in the color bronze ambition and I'm
just going to be placing that over where
we put the glue now I'm not too
concerned about the fallout with this
because it's a festival and I kind of
like the look of it so I just left it
normally you do this step before
applying your base and your foundation
powder bla bla bla so that you can
easily wipe that fallout away throw a
mascara I'm going with my better than
sex and I'm just quoting my natural
lashes with this it's pretty much empty
so I switch to using my still a mascara
after anyway
now with my urban decay heavy metal
guitar in the color Midnight Cowboy I'm
just going to be placing this under my
lower lash line now with my majesty
lashes I'm going in with the style Queen
these are the lashes I used in my last
video I actually just love the style of
these let's start wispy and they're just
really soft and pretty after that I'm
just going to go in with my still
mascara and just blend my natural lash
with the false lashes for highlight I'm
using my Mac soft and gentle placing
that down the shaft to my nose on my
Cupid fur and also on the highest part
of my cheekbones
lips I'm using coke okay and lip liner
in the color saw from Mac
so that is the end of the makeup
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it
