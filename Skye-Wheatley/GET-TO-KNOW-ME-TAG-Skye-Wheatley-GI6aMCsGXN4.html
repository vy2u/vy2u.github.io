heard jerks probably don't cuz that's an
invasion of privacy
I'll just come stalk you at your house I
am a makeup artist I also do YouTube but
I wouldn't really call it a job I refer
to it as more of like a hobby rather
than a job I'm a makeup artist by trade
my favorite color would have to be pink
I just I don't know I'm a girly girl who
lacks the colour pink surprise surprise
I do like the color pink and blue I am a
Piscean sorry I'm the Pisces which is
the true fish always going in opposite
direction and that's exactly what I'm
like it's really frustrating actually
sometimes because i'm the Smurfs
indecisive person you'll ever meet and
it's so hard to be me like you don't
even understand I can never ever make a
decision for myself
and it just becomes really hard
sometimes I'm that indecisive Oh me I
really like Katy Perry I went and saw
her movie that she made and it was just
like so inspiring and I just fell in
love with her
feel like all her songs have meanings
and I really like that Katy Perry's my
girl my favorite food would have to be I
just love bread I really love sushi like
I'm obsessed with sushi I am a massive
massive sweet tooth I love ice cream Ben
and Jerry's chocolate peanut M&amp;amp;Ms
anything Cadbury I'm infatuated with
cheese luck in love with cheese I just
love I love a good cracker and a good
chase snack I actually drink a lot of
water the only time I don't drink a lot
of water is when I'm hungover but if I
were to pick like a drink it would be
that
you're a drink with all the like aloe
vera bits in it sorry yummy get it from
Susie train it's honestly the best you
need try it I really loved Bali
I loved the snow but I can't really
remember it all that much because it was
when I was in school that we went there
on a school trip and obviously I
couldn't do everything that I wanted to
do because I was on a school trip
 hate sport I cannot watch it
either like I cannot watch sport
anything sport
get out of my face see you later not
interested
yeah I hated sport in school honestly
like I was a really good runner I was
really good at sport but I just hated it
because I'm a lazy bitch yeah yeah lazy
lazy lazy bitch lazy lazy lazy pooch
lazy lazy loser beauty ha ha ha I'm
always striving to be better than what I
am I would say that I'm really good at
makeup oh I ate like a pig you will not
want to eat next to me Michael hates
when I eat next to him he's like get
away from me Georgie dare come near me
with fruit because I eat like a pig
I sound like a horse or a cow or
something I don't know I really love my
personality I love how going I am I love
how I can have a conversation really
easily with anyone that I meet I really
like my eye color
hmm I love my tape I tape the old
natural I've never had braces I
obviously watching them I really enjoy
my teeth what is on top of your buckle
is jumping out of a plane going to
Europe and having babies and a little
husband but I mean that's a bit rare
they day now I'm just kidding you'll
find a good guy so lie this might sound
really really lame but my biggest
accomplishment was coming third in Big
Brother even getting on to Big Brother
was like a massive accomplishment
honestly that was the best thing I
couldn't I couldn't describe to you guys
the joy that I felt when they called me
and said you're in like it was just the
most amazing thing ever I achieved that
out of like thousands of people they
chose me
so anything that a guy plans and pays
for is my ideal day like you can take me
anywhere by me just buy me dinner pay
for me on the first day and I'm happy
you know guys don't do that anymore so
bizarre I'm like what do you mean no
maybe it's because I'm surfaces don't
when I gotta pay my new doorway I'll get
it
I'll pay babe that's when you say oh no
don't worry about it I've got it cuz I'm
the man and men should pay on the first
day I'm sorry I know this equal equal
equality this equality stuff has come in
to the 21st century but I'm old school
okay I just yeah I think guys should pay
on the first night sir yeah how can
anything anything what is something you
look for in a partner
loyalty sense of humor someone who just
like compliments me and who can like
constantly bring me up and support me
and and support what I do for work
so yeah which of your parents are you
more like probably my dad he's a bit of
a slob and he's so stupid he's like not
all there so I'd say I'm more like him
sorry dinner
sorry dinner I mean I have some of my
mom's good traits but then I have some
of my dad's good and bad traits I really
look at my mother's having good traits
like oh don't say my mom is having any
bad traits at all cause she's like
perfection but my dad yeah yep which one
of my parents and my closest true
definitely my mom I haven't really had
too much to do with dinner yeah
definitely lack Abdul my mom and a pre
she ate everything she's done for me she
raised Kayla and I as a single mom and
she's literally my biggest hero like I'm
obsessed with her my mom told me this
quite the other day I don't remember it
word for word but she was saying how
this man got asked a question by someone
else who is your biggest hero and this
man said I am my biggest hero in 10
years time in ten years time he got
asked the same question who is your
biggest hero and he said my hero is me
in ten years time so basically he's
always looking up to himself and always
trying to better himself and always
trying to achieve what he can achieve
and he would never compare himself to
others he would always just try to be
the best that he could be it's so
beautiful you are so beautiful to me
can't you see what after you use the
most probably face - not gonna lie
and like vsco cam Instagram I never use
Facebook actually that's something that
I just don't use I don't think I have
like that one best friend but I have
amazing group of friends that I'm really
close with and yeah I've just loved all
my friends what piece of technology
could you not live it up oh that's all
my fun I was like I want to quash on
what countries would you like to visit
every single bloody country I feel like
even if you go to a country that's not
as beautiful as Australia it can kind of
open your eyes and teach you a lot of
lessons so yeah I really love to
describe to any country to be honest I
feel like with every country there's a
lesson in sir
I've been to China Thailand Bali Dubai
I think that's it yeah Wow that's it
sure I got a god-awful on more off the
top I got a great traveling how many
relationships have you been in okay
let's count Oh Scott
Anthony Sheldon
Dion Hayden who came off to Hayden Oh
Casey doc Oh Casey
Tim yeah I'm pretty sure that's it five
six seven eight I've only had eight
boyfriends well not only like that's a
lot of boyfriends but yeah I think I've
had eight boyfriends oh my god I feel
like I'm missing someone no I don't
think so I don't know my memory is
really shocking to be honest
what's my best memory I don't know I
don't know I could give my younger self
any advice what would it be
never ever ever compare yourself to
anyone else
always always appreciate what you have
always loved your family because at the
end of the day they are going to be the
ones that are going to stick by you it'd
be nice to everyone and treat people how
you want to be treated that's my advice
to the youngest guy Murray Wheatley she
was a freakin idiot so she probably
wouldn't even listen anyway everything
will always get better and even if
you're feeling the hurt or pain is or
not the end of the world these painful
experiences that you have are teaching
you lessons and they're making you and
molding you into the person that you
will become later on down the track so
literally take a chill pill be as
positive as you can in any experience in
situation that may cross your path and
you'll be all good sister what okay guys
sorry that is the end of this QA I hope
you guys enjoyed this relaxed video in
my bedroom talking about me I feel like
I've done so many of these like get to
know me videos but not they get to know
