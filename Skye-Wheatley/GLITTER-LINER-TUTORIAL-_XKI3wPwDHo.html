to find with all things that's going on
I lost track of some strong
too late apologized to lay I said too
late to apologize
oh you make seeds on the sweet talk to
me yeah hey OH
talk to me go yeah break it down
talk to me hey guys and welcome back to
my channel
you all seem scary Wheatley almost grey
atm how are we all it's been a while huh
highlight in this video that's
disgusting
left 4 ha ha now that start I'm going to
doing this Michael cook for you today
so if you like it and you want to see
how I did it then keep on watching okay
Kyle I'm going to be using the Bethel by
Jaclyn hill which is a little smashed
off cute adorable really
oh well I'm scared of Milan because I
don't fit my whole lot buying makeup or
anything
alright I always forget to highlight
they'll just make my mascara busted up
even more anyway I hope you guys liked
this makeup tutorial

probably annoy the F of some people
while watching this I apologize I'm not
a naturally tanned Aboriginal I wish I
was but unfortunately I'm not was that
racist I'm not I'm not a racist person
like actually David an Aboriginal guy
and like I wish that I had Aboriginal in
my blood or just some type of anything
that makes you brown ah let's get
started
hey guys and welcome back to it I have
already started with my eyebrows on I
kind of have a little bit of a different
style when it comes to my eyebrows
compared to that video I filmed a while
back sorry let me know if you want an
updated brow routine I'll show you my
brows II can you think can you speed you
to do that what you see I just wanted to
say the reason why I look like a little
toad turn turtle towards I don't know
whatever you want to think I look like
it's because I have no lectures left I
have the arm lash extensions put on I've
been wearing lash extensions or as long
as I can remember so I thought it would
be good to give my eyelashes a break I
always read so much ah like shut up when
people watch a makeup tutorial they want
to see the framing and the foundation
I'm going to be using wait let me call
mash it up first
Oh seriously this is my all-time
favorite foundation Gloria look super
much and you
wonderful fly up and never use a dirty
beauty butter because that's how you get
egg on your face
like me allow you to judge me mother and
now got mad don't break up if you can
see like I'm going to be using my nod I
love this it's so good and it's in
the color medium to ginger oh my gosh it
is sir me I'm actually a ginger placing
that on my eyes down the Shelf to my
nerves would ya and y'all okay now we're
going to live the death the good thing
about having lash extensions on is you
can go hard you make up it just got over
the toes of your eyes good texting me
hey hey I'm filming you gonna do oh wait
can you see there we go oh it's the
whole club when I try to feel this
seriously in which it doesn't let the
chicken on the bench
alright so there's no weight everywhere
oh sorry nice put it in the sink beer
why cuz Oh her after we've done that I'm
going to be using my Australis freshmen
will count off but it's really smashed
off sorry I already use it and I'll go
bronze I'm going to be using my hula
hula hula hula a benefit I love this
stuff but it runs out sure quickly let's
look how much I've used and I've had it
for what
come on also how to bring this up
reimagine pull up around my hairline
that I'm going to be going in with my
Rimmel London match perfection loose
powder getting that on my beading result
and going I'm going to I'm scared I
never do this let us sit for a little
bit
do you okay sir the ocular is like super
basic because I did a dramatic wing all
the acts are going to be using my Too
Faced chocolate bar center swing
from going in with my model prefer funky
brush going to go in with the color no
no got no head no get suck it pinky
pinky shade and I'm just going to be
brushing that all through my grades okay
so once that's done I'm going to pick up
a smaller blending brush and I'm just
going with the color root maybe move do
we want some mousse I'm just going to be
placing it up on the outer eyelid I've
also taken up through my crease but a
little bit lower than that pinky shade
you just use what are going to taking it
under my eyes it started of course and a
Hawksley angle brush which is what I'm
going to be using to put on my eyeliner
hello eyeliner that I do oh my god is
this our teeth selection cosmetic I
don't like I prefer over the Maybelline
because it's more wet and doesn't dry
quickly they're easier to work with and
it's going through my my eyes now the
trick to this is to look down into the
mirror and start
Yop in the inner corner of the eye and
just stays close to the lashes as you
can okay and then repeat that step on
the other side ah no without okay so now
what you want to go in with your heavy
metal urban decay a little eyeliner on
and we're just I'm too far over the top
goes out we want it flowing that one
with the little
and that way you can do sup anyway
stated let me do this step great so once
that is done I'm going to apply mascara
I'll be using that I think it this do
law sorrow and it's cold mall hi like I
said mom my lashes jet-black I'm pretty
sure it still off okay Sophie lashes I'm
going to be using majesty luscious
install Queen and I didn't bring my
jewelers on this going trade using this
little glam eyes glue for the lips I'm
going to be using Kylie Jenner and I'm
using the / zk the plow and the crazy k
pink color look what happens to them I
will start off it because I love them so
much but that's okay he's me what is
