welcome back but welcome back to my
channel that was supposed to be a joke
okay
anyway I noticed how hairy my legs were
the other day and I thought okay I'm
going to film a wax tutorial on how I
wax my iron legs because sometimes it
can get quite tricky if you have your
own wax pot at home I'm sure you know
the utensils that you need go through
the steps for you again because the
people that don't know need to know okay
so the things that you will need some of
them are optional like you don't they're
not um were they're not they're not
compulsory to have but for me it helps
you know one thing that helps me out the
most when I'm doing my waxing is gloves
because I seriously hate feeling that
stickiness of the wax on my hands
personally I hate having things on my
hands I hate having things on my fingers
so gloves are a good one to have also
when you're cleaning your wax pot um the
wax cleaner can be quiet drying to your
skin so yeah you also want pre wax
cleanser if you're on a budget you don't
have to have this a must-have when it
comes to waxing and that is after wax
skin cleanser and moisturizer um you can
use like any normal oil oil-based skin
moisturizer that may help the wax come
off I don't know because this is what I
use it's so good because when you've got
that sticky residue left over from when
you have waxed your legs it's super
annoying and you don't want to have
sticky patches all over your legs so
this gets every little last bit of that
off last but not least you want wash
remover citrus clean um
I use this to clean my wax pot and it's
amazing
we'll need this because especially if
you drop wax anywhere it's good to clean
that up sorry
let's get on with it the first thing you
will need to do is exfoliate your legs
so let's go do that so what I'm using to
scrub my legs with is just like a sea
salt um you want to try and avoid
anything that's oil-based because then
it's going to make it really hard for
you to actually wax your legs so after
I've scrubbed my legs with this I'm just
going to go back with an exfoliating
mitt and put some uh no shower gel
shower gels any soap that you have on
that and just scrub the residue from the
oil that's in the scrub off my legs
you
after you finish this step you just want
to dry your legs off thoroughly and get
into something baggy that allows you to
be quite flexible I like to put on old
naughty just in case I get wax on it and
it won't matter as much
then you want to put your hair up
because if you've got long hair you
don't want to be waxing that off as well
okay so I'm just going to cleanse my
legs with this and like I said before
this step isn't that important so if
you're on a budget or if you don't have
any of this stuff don't worry so now I'm
just getting my waxing paper my spatula
and I've made sure that my wax is at a
quite runny consistency
so the gloves that I like to use are
quite small I just like them to be
really firm and I'm doing my waxing so
that they're not sliding around all over
the place if you know what I mean
Oh
you
when waxing larger areas like the top of
the slide you want to make sure that you
are pulling back and supporting that
flabby skin so yeah little bits of fat
like this and me inside of my thigh you
want to make sure that you're pulling
back so that you're not going to bruise
yourself when you're gripping the wax
strip off you need to make sure that
it's as firm as possible so just use
your hand to pull the skin or the fat
back and that should help serve the area
so that was my waxing tutorial and I
hope you enjoyed it I'm going to go
against Russia now and be like hey boy
want some sex these damn man jokes I
hope you enjoyed that tutorial I'm sorry
it looked like I was doing a Pororo
satire
that's just how I wax my own legs and is
very difficult um especially if you're
not flexible but I'm so sick of going to
salons that miss a little bit - hair
everywhere like it is hard to miss it is
hard to get every single hair because
I've got very blonde hair but I mean
when I do it myself it's just so much
more perfect and it's done properly and
my legs have not been this threesome cuz
I'm the best wax up on the Gold Coast
like legit I used to work in a beauty
salon and my boss taught me how to wax
legs properly and I bet there's going to
be some beauty gurus down below in the
comment box thing like you did this
wrong or you did that wrong but I don't
care I get the job done and every single
hair is removed by the end of my waxing
job so that's the only thing I care
about you know if you want to see how I
drew eyebrows also ah if anyone wants a
tutorial have a tutorial on how to wax
their nostrils armpits anything slipping
or I'm actually getting IPL under my arm
and it's working at rate so I haven't
needed to wax my armpits obviously I
cannot show you how the punani is waxed
because that's murder tea and we don't
want nudity give this video a thumbs up
if it helped and
you know yeah that's what I will say I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
