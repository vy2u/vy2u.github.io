pillow this rock likes very
different and walking in the jungle and
picked up a bunch of rocks and
relax yeah let's put them on my bed I'm
just like princess in the pin when I
translate Lee I need a certain type of
killer
I hate those ones the darker than them
where your head sinks into it and
arrival well you have to keep changing
the pillow and rotating it so next time
I go stay with Michael
i'ma bring my own pillow okay because I
love the beach Navia
bowls are super convenient and I get it
ordered straight to my door birthdays
I hate these now and instead I'm in the
PJs and seeing a big fat mess that I am
okay I trust this company okay I've been
using this for so long now that I
like it and it worked for me but I do it
I believe you
I trust you and Lego start in the
morning I obviously comment
bathroom and brush my teeth so I like to
wet my brush if I put toothpaste on your
it need much of it such as dust as much
as a you and when I just go on to brush
my teeth look good I always make sure to
do my tongue - because your tongue have
a lot of germs on it started off like
you in the morning time and then if I'm
going out maybe like on a Friday or
Sunday night I like to do a Minecraft on
the Thursday so normally I will do
wiring once a week and do it over that
time so now I'm going to show you how I
wash my teeth before the weekend so I
mainly do all my prep work st. and teeth
whitening hair whatever a girl needs to
prep for the lesions on a Thursday or
Friday night so I will get my night Ruth
paste and make sure that my teeth are
completely clean and then I will go on
the tube wash in them pretty simple you
guys so this is what the nighttime
should pay for place
it's got charcoal in it that way black
okay so we're compared to a normal tooth
pain with this really natural and it's
like a more light version so when you
clean your teeth it still feels really
fresh and clean afterwards so you just
want to pour it a line of it on the top
here and then switch it over and do a
line on the bottom here so once you've
done that you just pop it in
switch your light on and it has a time
on it so it will be pay you when it's
finished I like to press the button once
or twice depends on feeling sometimes
I'll press the button three times to get
that extra extra whitening on my teeth
the thing that's really handy about this
is that you actually have to hold it in
your mouth really easy and great for
multitasking if you need to be doing
other stuff at the same time I just like
to relax so as I will do okay
one ball well was that supposed to
happen
now that is that all over my force so
preferably maybe take it out over just
think I was just trying to show you guys
how to take Bella God literally big
spell my life anyway excuse I'm not just
rinse your mouth out also been sick
leave that to dry
awesome take in my mouth got out I like
to do brush my teeth again urine half -
it's optional I guess you could just
rinse your mouth now they also do a
coconut mouth rinse mate you can use I'm
just going to brush my teeth to go with
a nice tooth pain
that is how I was meant to win hi Skyler
is can you out there different I can see
a massive difference my face actually
start getting a little bit sensitive
because to be honest I haven't won my
teeth in ages and I feel like that Joe
might be a little bit stronger than the
old Joel which is good cause you're
white paper wax EP I love it there's
nothing better than having fresh white
teeth it's the best it's kind of
 and by the way overtired under
my onesie I'm ready to grab it love you
all
are you alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
