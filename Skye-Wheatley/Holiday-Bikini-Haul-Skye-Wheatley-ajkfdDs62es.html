it's got low B we play got love really
in today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you a few pounds of bikinis that I
picked up from TJ's I am basically I
just picked up a few pairs of bikinis
because I'm going to Bali and will
probably mostly be in bikinis I hope you
guys enjoy this little bikini pool we'll
get straight into it I think I have how
many pads do I have I have less we count
one two three four five six so I have
six pairs of bikinis that I'll be
showing you yeah let's just get straight
into there I hope you guys enjoy
Wow okay so the first pair of bikinis
are that I picked up were this are
really cute in one piece all white and
it's backless so this goes around your
neck like so and then you have your
whole back showing which is why it was
like yeah girl I'm getting that because
who doesn't love a little bit of a sexy
back Keener sorry these are like cheeky
boats they cover moisture but in my case
they cover a little bit of my butt
because my butt is ginormous
so yeah that's them and they are in a
size small should the second bikini that
I picked up was this really cute true
piece and how I would describe this
fabric is metallic because it's kind of
shiny kind of like a mermaid tail and
it's just one of those really basic tops
of just girls across your boobies like
sorry but what I really love about these
is that the straps really thin so you're
not going to get really bad
lines yeah it's just really simple and
basic which is what I love and it's just
really pretty nude color like I said in
the metallic fabric here are the bottoms
for this one I got these in a size small
again really love that this is really
thin so you're not getting really big
ugly tan lines
the next bikini and I picked up is this
really beautiful aqua color the top of
this has underwear underneath it so if
you feel like you want that support when
you go to the beach or when you're
wearing a bikini then this would be
perfect for you and then they've also
got the adjustable straps at the back
and they just clip on clip-on they clip
in like this so it just has that little
clip at the back this is what the top
looks like really cute I will show you
guys at the end of the video what each
bikini looks like so you can see and
i'll put doing order and then i'll also
put the name of the bikinis the size and
how much they are retailing for the
bottom two doors pretty much yeah their
g-strings it's a part of me
it's a g-string which I don't mind
because I want my butt to be 10 because
you know what a 10 hides cellulite and I
got a lot of cellulite so yeah I really
love bikinis other g-strings I think
they're really fluttering my favorite
thing about these bottoms is you can
wear them up high-waisted actually I can
pretty much wear all of them up
high-waisted which is what I really like
to do because I feel like it looks more
flattering on the body especially
because I have like a really short torso
I just think it looks a lot sexier if
I'm wearing them up high rise did pass
my hips I've got another bikini in that
same color
it's like aqua blue and these just have
a really cute little tight
up at the front and then the back is
just super basic super cute and then for
the bottoms
these are cheeky cut high-waisted like
these are actually high-waisted really
love these bottoms because you just feel
like all your junk is in you know what I
mean like if you're not feeling
comfortable going to the beach and a
g-string then these are perfect like the
other most perfect cut ever so yeah
really happy with those and then two
more pairs I got just just really cute
simple Wyatt set so this is just like a
boob tube and then it has a nerve wire
there for support I guess it's a really
thin strap at the back the bottom
there's all size small by the way so
they're just the cheeky cut and again
you can wear them around your hips or up
high waisted if you please and the last
pair that I picked up is this a really
beautiful maroon is that maroon maroon
color straight-across style bikini
segments the first one that I showed you
guys so yeah same style of different
color again that metallic material feels
really good quality I probably could
have gone outsides up in this just
because my titties are big and they
almost pop out like it fits me but I
think I could have gone a size up in
those here are the bottoms I wore these
to the beach this morning that is all
that I picked up from TJ swim I love
this where where I think it's so simple
and so beautiful that stuff is just like
really good to tanyon really great
fabric really cute styles and they are
all really affordable I will show you
