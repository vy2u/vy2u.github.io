is Scott Mowbray we may scalloway we
play only with a brunette hair this time
I hope you guys are well tonight I
thought I would sit down and film a
different but fun sort of video I just
recently got sent a whole heap of my
contacts from opulent lenses by posting
it on my snapchat a few weeks ago and
everyone was asking me where I got them
but I was like you know what I'm gonna
show you guys all of the colors that I
go and show you what they actually look
like in eyes I feel like these are the
most realistic eye contacts I've ever
had so I just wanted to share it with
you guys because I know it's really fun
to create different looks and change
your eye color so let's get straight
into it I hope you guys enjoy this video
make sure you give it a big thumbs up
for me ma alright sorry they also sent
me out some tools that you can use to
put the contacts in with although you
guys I have a code that you couldn't use
to get a discount if you wanted to
purchase any of these lenses so I will
leave that code right here on the screen
for you guys if you struggle putting our
contacts in I can usually do it with my
fingers but she sent me these really
great tools so it's like pieces and it
looks like a mini plunger but basically
what you do is just put the eye contacts
on that and you just place it straight
onto your eye and it's the same shape as
what your eyeball is so it just go
straight in
so the first car I'm going to be showing
you guys is forest green there yeah you
just put the icon touch on this little
thing like so and then just place it
straight into your eye
see
oh my god that's together out of me
oh you go talk to my holy
sorry this is the color forest green
okay so that's that and then to take
them out you can use just use the
tweezers and up just pick them out of
your eye and the gone alright so the
next color I got is gray forest they
come like this in little packets and
then you just rip them open and what I
did was use the solution that's in there
and then pour it into the little
container that you get
wow that's freaky make their cool about
that freaky see how realistic they look
though maybe not days maybe you know
this girl but they are really nice
alright so the color that I got is
crystal pearl Wow I love them they'll
turn on as well so far these are my
faith I've been everywhere man I've been
everywhere they'll store pretty I love
them
literally so pretty but discolor I'm
putting in right now a stand well these
are so pretty love them love love love

what's this color then oh I think that's
when I just did really love my own
Ayatollah just saying alright so I'm
pretty sure that's bumble pear this is a
loft para house yeah they're like
Paisley Paisley green oh actually no
they're not bringing now it around me
yellowy
alrighty sorry that is the last color
that I received honestly you guys need
to contact us seriously so stunning
there's so many different colors to
choose from all the ones I thought look
so realistic in my eyes no they did I
feel like they look the most realistic
and if you choose something close to
your natural color eye that's what's
going to look the most natural if you
often like you're crazy why I think

special event then these are perfect I
