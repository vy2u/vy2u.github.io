it's got Mowbray waiter
Posca Marie Cleveland Oh
yesterday they job is not as anything
it's just nothing welcome back to my
channel beautiful people tonight I sell
first time in my life
decided I'm gonna go to the gym and I'm
gonna do a little workout and you know
what girl I don't want to be looking
like this when I walk into my gym
because believe it or not there's always
people there what's the time at 9
o'clock at night which is when I like to
go over night time cuz I'm a night out
it's a problem it's a problem I kind of
anyway I was like yup you know what I'm
going to show you guys how I do my
makeup for the gym because let's be
honest not all of us feel comfortable
going a fresh face to the gym I'm like -
but girlfriend there's a lot of boys
over there okay there's also a lot of
hot chick needs of the net I don't want
to feel like a drowned mole rat in the
gym and I just feel like a walking
zombie with no makeup so I'm gonna wear
makeup to the gym but you know what it's
okay because it's all mineral makeup and
that's what I wanted to share with you
guys today and just show you what
products I use and just show you that it
is
easy to pull off makeup at the gym if
you go natural rel okay so let's do this
confessing ourself with is the skin or
true Iranian primer so this is a mineral
primer and it is adaptable true anyone's
skin turn so if you're dark of iron in
the middle red and pink orange green I
don't know whatever skin turn you may be
this little baby right here of will
adapt to your skin tone once you put it
on your face so I'm just going to use
about dripped off of that and just apply
that to my face okay what I'll crack
without makeup but around my eyes get
sore bloodshot and this probably because
I have up sleeping patterns I
just want to look for not good okay
almost good but I'm training coz there's
 mirrors everywhere
okay and the number one thing for
everyone and for yourself is to look
good for you and it's real comfortable
in your own skin so you see how that's
already just given me like I'm not so
blurred I'm just I'm gonna work it in
around my eyes because that's where I
lift the most bed you know what I'm
saying last night I went to Michael's
and met Bella and like Shaunie and
Ronnie really room was there any
order who eats and we got bloody Indian
so now I'm like enough you know what I
need to go to the gym because we're
going to LA in like three weeks from now
and I don't want to be looking like a
couch potato you know what I mean better
get all not sure what ever time that
I look like that I'm going to be going
in with my Skinner true perfect skin
concealer what I love about these
products is that they're actually treat
your skin while you wear it so say I
have a pimple like right here if I can
steal that it would work to kill all the
bacteria got that pimple mat be carrying
or like whatever iron I'm not sucking
skin dr. Klenner it is that it treats
your skin while you wear it it's really
important to wear mineral makeup when
you go to the gym so that your skin can
still breathe so I'm just gonna like dab
such blend doc conceal it out I mean
jinsol a really social meaning areas
these days on day thank you never going
to meet your future husband in the gym
they say you know that you didn't go out
clubbing because you're just fine
 losers who like to drink every
weekend if you want to find yourself a
good man good with the gym okay that's
bad Albie
no no okay
that doesn't want that doesn't want to
leave okay so then once the kids seal is
done I like to just literally the
smallest bit of mineral powder over the
top of my face I'll be using the Skinner
true mineral foundation in the color
mocha
this makeup is on the face sorry Julie
you know - you're also doing like a brow
powder but I just changed my browser to
be honest I don't think I need any more
products
indeed brows I'm just going to brush
them up now if you feel confident and
not going to the gym without any scar
then good for you go buckle me I don't
know this is not okay so we're gonna put
some garlic first I'm going to curl my
lashes
there's my scar I'm going to be using a
Skinner and shear mascara
well my lashes gone seriously okay now
my mascara is done I'm going to finish
this gym makeup tutorial which literally
takes two seconds oh my god Angie's in
my penny leave so let's get your lip
gloss pretty sure it has like yeah it's
got um collagen in it so it actually
works to plump and hydrate your lips all
that good stuff you know when you're
working out you need that in your life
ignore the hair load like it's all about
the face and the bootay
I can't say that is that completed
makeup look for the gym and nice quick
and easy and if I'm working up a sweat
in the gym it does not matter it's not
gonna clog my pores and it's not going
to cause any breakouts and like I said
it's all mineral we're not actually have
to regard the gym so you guys are gonna
come with me and I'll just show you a
little bit workout
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
