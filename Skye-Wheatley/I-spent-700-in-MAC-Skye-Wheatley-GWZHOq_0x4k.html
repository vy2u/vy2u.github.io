it's scout movie wheezy in today's video
I'm going to show you what I picked up
from Mac because I took a little trip
down James Street in Brisbane whether
Mac Pro stories and I picked up more
than what I usually would like a decent
amount of stuff I just really needed to
stock up my makeup cause I was like
running yeah and half of its at my mom's
house and half of the tear it was time
for a little bit of new makeup because I
haven't gone and bought my own makeup in
the longest time so so like I'm gonna
show you guys what I got I also sat down
and got my makeup done I'm really super
impressed with my makeup like I think it
looks stunning
normally when someone else does my
makeup I don't really vibe it but this
girl was amazing but her name was Sarah
and she works at the James Street Mac
Pro store in Brisbane so if you ever
need to makeup done I highly recommend
you go see her cuz she was literally
amazing and gave me so much hope with
like what products I needed an acceptor
I'll throw it let's just jump straight
into the video and I'll show you guys
what I picked up actor girl whole bag of
Mac stuff here
yeah okay I'm so talented so the first
thing that I picked up is their new Mac
prep and prime Miss spray so this is
more of like a matte spray rather than
the old one which was like it's it gives
you that like really Julie look and
Julie feel as you can see my makeup will
show Matt it doesn't look oily at all
and that's because she used this on my
face so I was like oh my god I need that
it's the same mr. Fixx spray plus but
it's matte sorry we're making your oily
and I'm like you realize that Julie
effect that they on does but yeah I was
like oh my god I need this basically
it's just a setting spray but it doesn't
make you go Joey if you don't want to be
joining if you're not into that then
that would be for you and then I picked
up some foundation I've got the studio
fix fluid and it
fifteen and this is in the color and c40
we match the color to my tan which is
really amazing like literally matched so
perfectly and I'm really happy with how
it's looking on my face we use all these
products on my face when cheating my
makeup so I could actually see what it
looked like and then in there in store
so yeah I've got that perfect shade for
fake tan also got a primer because what
primer do I normally use I don't know I
usually use the Porefessional but this
was so amazing made my skin look so
fresh and dewy and plump it's also I
think she said it's age-defying for
aging skip it helped correct while like
dude its primer thing which is whatever
a promising does help the makeup stay on
basically a primer for me like a good
primer for me would be to like hydrate
and prep my skin for the makeup because
sometimes if I don't moisturize or
hydrate my skin that my foundation kill
what kind of cakey and flaky and you
don't want that and then I also picked
up their mineral powder so this is the
skin finish I got I love max packaging
it's so sophisticated and this is in the
color ib6 on our way it just it says a
be six medium plus mineralized
skinfinish so it looks quite a lot like
when you look at it like this but as you
can see I'm wearing it now and it's
literally the perfect color yeah stays
true go together like wild file they're
amazing really helped me with these two
processes I picked up one of that
palettes and I was like oh my god I have
to have that because you have all the
shades that I normally use on my eyes we
created this look on my eyes right now
using this palette so if you guys want
me to recreate this look into a makeup
swirl then let me
nor be sorry having to fill not cleanse
his palate is like literally amazing so
this is the mischief minks palette look
at the packaging that are you for real
I'm obsessed I'm a bit sick by the way
up so I sound like a mom this is what it
looks like
I love love i love love these colors
like it start popping for me because
these all the colors that like i
normally gravitate Ravello like girl
that's going straight my bus yep what
else do we get okay so a dis product is
like one of my all-time favorite
products back in the day and then I
smashed the bottle so I couldn't really
use it but I've got the brow gel and
it's just the clear brow gel oh my god
give me that I need that this is what it
looks like just a clear brow gel I find
a clear brow gels are like way easier to
work with because put the tinted ones
you kind of conquer crazy and like
pushing the brows off but like I'm doing
now because with the tin it kind of gets
all over your skin gets in your
foundation and in your powder just a
little cute but this one's clear so you
can just go ham I really like what it
looks like in the brows if this is
perfect just flatly dying not a problem
I picked up the prolong concealer I was
using the nos concealer and I ran out
with that I was like give me something
that's similar to that because I do
black it I just ran out of it really
brightens stories like dark circles and
pigmentation like red spots
what about whatever you're trying to
conceal come on it's really high
coverage almost like yes give it to me
and this is in the color NW 30 and let
me know if you guys want to see like a
tutorial we the oldest saw so you can
actually see what it looks like on the
skin like obviously I'm wearing a little
bit now but yeah I feel like if I do a
tutorial you guys can see it all go on
and not just to find the product you
know I'm saying the next thing that I
got is the brush stroke liner so it's
like a tip felt liner which is like oh
my god so exciting
had to have this I actually haven't been
using a a felt-tip I normally use the
gel liners and just use a brush but
these are so easy to use and it's such a
nice brush like look how thin that is it
gives like the most beautiful line like
it's surf shop you could do some crazy
wings with that so I just had to have
that oh my god like give it to me and
then I just picked up some lip learners
and also I've got their new highlighter
so beautiful my all-time favorite
highlighter was the soft and gentle one
that they had so when she was like we
have a new highlighter I was like oh my
god I need to try it because the soft
and gentle one was like my all-time
favorite so this is the whisper guilt
extra dimension skin finish so pretty oh
my God look at that damn girl amazing so
the one that I bought on my lips at the
moment is in control so this is similar
to the I think it swirl which is like
one of my all-time favorites actually no
way I actually don't think this is
what's on my lips because I put
something over the top okay never mind
this isn't what's on my lips this is
like what's around my lips so this is
the lip liner that I use and then I put
another liquid liner or another liquid
lipstick Arthur the top yeah I'll show
you guys what all these pencils look
like obviously in makeup Charles that I
do in the future
duh oh my god yeah so I in control are
honey so this is like a really pretty
nude color and it's got like the tiniest
bit of I think pink like a little bit of
pinky and it sounds like oh my god give
it to me I also got electrical yeah so
this is a nerd culture pretty
and then I got three brushes which I'm
super excited to use I just got a
blending brush
we all need a really good quality
blending brush so I'm really excited to
use this add that to the collection and
then I also got also all that brushes
are synthetic now they don't use the
real hairs which I was like Oh for
because synthetic brushes are definitely
the way to go and I got this brush which
is like a multi-purpose brush you can
use it for conceal I can use it for like
applying glitter you can use it for
eyeshadows and then last but not least I
got this little Mac angle brush perfect
for cream contour kit even you use this
to apply foundation obviously I want to
use it for bronzer you get that really
nice to fine line there honestly so soft
and such good quality brushes like I
have a few Mac brushes already and they
are a little bit expensive but you
definitely pay for quality anyway that
is all I picked up from Mac I hope you
