welcome to my channel if you're new here
hi there nice to meet you please
subscribe please like this video if you
do this video today is just going to be
me basically sitting down having a chat
with you guys and telling you guys about
what's been going on because I feel like
I've been gone from YouTube for so long
it's only been two weeks I'm gonna leave
by the way yeah
so it's been two weeks since I put a
video haven't really been vlogging much
lately I've just been super busy I'm
starting up by her own bikini line with
my friend Jemma so we've been away in
another country sorting that out going
to different manufacturing companies and
trying to get the perfect cut the
perfect material having samples made up
and all that fun stuff but tomorrow I'm
going through Sydney to have my nose
done by dr. Zachariah in double bay now
I kind of just wanted to sit down this
video and kind of explain to you why
I've decided to have an O shop and I
just wanted to basically yeah just
talked about me having plastic surgery
and me making that decision to go ahead
and have it done I think okay how am I
gonna say
okay by me coming and getting my nose
done doesn't necessarily mean I'm trying
to spread the message that you need to
have plastic surgery to feel good about
yourself to feel happy to feel good
enough I'm not that's not the message
I'm trying to send to anyone I believe
that if you're a good person on the
inside and you have a good heart and you
mean well and you don't change when you
do change the physical appearance and
you stay who you are inside I believe
that it's totally it's totally okay for
you to have something done I think that
if it's going to make you feel better
about yourself if it's going to make you
a little happier when you look in the
mirror because let's be honest we all
have things that we don't love about
ourselves we look in the mirror I think
it's totally okay and I want to share
the whole experience with you guys and
just be completely honest and upfront
about what I'm having done really want
than or is just just snatch just add
splashed okay sorry let me explain to
you what I'm actually doing what dr.
Zachariah is actually doing this week
drew my friggin head in yeah okay so the
main thing that I didn't like about my
nose it's not the side of it like this
part has always been so straight it's
the nostrils though I just I'm really
self-conscious about I don't think a
compliment they face it all I just I
just I don't already just been something
that I've always been so insecure about
and it's not necessarily noticeable to
others it's not something that others
can see but when you're a makeup artist
you tend to become a little bit of a
perfectionist well a lot a bit of a
perfectionist so I'm really really I'm
chasing something that impossible really
because I would love to perfect who
wouldn't it's just not a reality but if
I can make my nose a little bit more
symmetrical and if I can become
you know more confident and feel more
comfortable within my own skin and Myron
ORS then that's awesome for me you know
that makes me really happy anyway sorry
I just got really distracted so the
thing that I hate I'm not going to say
Heights from the strong guard holy shit
I ramble the thing that I want change
about my nose is basically my nostrils
and very uneven
they're very flared sorry like when I
talk or if I sing they go like that and
I'm just really self-conscious about it
I just yet they point up as you can see
which I really don't like and nostrils
are very just big and I feel like you
can see my whole brain when you look up
me at this angle I don't know maybe I'm
being shallow maybe I've been stupid but
I just don't like my nose anyway dr.
Zakaria is one of the best nurse doctors
in Australia so I'm really excited and
I'm really confident in him that he can
give me the nose I've always dreamt of
he's just going to be putting a little
bit of cartilage in here to stop that
flare think was shaving a little bit
here just the tiniest bit because I
really don't need much dunk er and then
he's just going to I think he was saying
he was going to take a little bit of
that away because it's quite bulbous in
my opinion okay maybe you don't think so
but I do anyway my main message in this
video I'm not encouraging anyone to go
out and get plastic surgery I'm not
trying to sell you guys a nose job and
I'm not trying to convince anyone or try
to send a message that in order to be
happy with yourself you have to get
plastic surgery that's not the message
that I want to send I believe that if
you want to have something done and if
it's going to make you feel ten times
more
and comfortable within your own skin I
believe that it's completely okay I
don't think anyone should judge you on
that I just think that it matters about
what's on the inside and then people
will be like well you're being such a
hypocrite if it matters so much about
what's in the inside then why are you
changing your face it's a choice that
I've made it's a decision that I've
thought long and hard about and I just I
want it done for me I don't really care
about anyone elses opinion I'm just here
to share it with you guys and I'm just
wanting to be really honest and open
about everything because no one's
perfect and I'm sorry but majority of
the people you guys follow or majority
of the people other people follow that
are so stunningly beautiful and appear
perfect have had so much work done just
no one knows about it basically I just
want to say you're beautiful inside and
out everyone is unique and different in
their own little way yeah I hope you
move today a bit of salmon okay I'm
coming down there SEC love you I really
need to move out I mean I love my family
bond
first you don't know yet how long it
took me to set up for this video and
that's another thing like I it's getting
to the point now where I can't even this
sounds really shallow and I'm so sorry
it's just getting to the point now where
I don't I don't I know that people going
to look at mangoes
freaking hell she's being ridiculous
she's so shallow we're all right I'm not
fine people can have their opinions and
I mean people will be nasty and have a
horrible opinion at the end of the day
but to be honest it's none of your
fucking business it's none of your
business what my choices are in life I
mean yes you can have an opinion because
I'm being so open and honest and I'm
sharing with you guys and obviously
people going to say whatever they want
to buy but yeah I'm I'm really rambling
I just like I know I'm not really
rambling I've just missed you guys and
there's been so much shit that's been
going on and I felt oh that's right I'll
saying how just I pray for anyone who
has to watch my videos and try to like
sit there and understand me I was saying
oh yes it's getting to the point now
where I'm so insecure about my nose that
I I just don't enjoy editing my videos
anymore because it's just one thing that
I just stare at and I'm like why can't
you just be I just focus on it and I
mean that's not a good thing to focus on
something that you hate you should
always focus on the things that you do
love about yourself but I mean if I can
change it and if I can feel a hundred
times better and if I can make myself
just a little bit more confident then I
don't see anything wrong with it we
don't see anyone who has had surgery I'm
there for you if you want to chat about
it if you want to talk if anyone is over
thinking about having a nose job and
they're a bit worried or stressed out
about it at least you can you know watch
my videos if you find them and just
relate to me and that's that's kind of
why I want to document the whole thing
when I was researching you know what
doctor to go to dr. Zachariah has worked
on a lot of people that have a similar
case to mine whereas other doctors kind
of just specialize in removing the lump
so I really wanted a good doctor that
could reconstruct my nose here and not
necessarily just focus on this part yeah
if anyone has a nose like mine and they
hate it too because they know what I'm
talking about
then you know what doctor to go jury
that's that's maybe just basically what
I've got to say and just yeah a little
bit of catch-up what else has been
happening so oh my gosh okay I went to
buy I didn't really tell you guys much
about the by country's beautiful
experience was horrible certain
companies just use the shit out of
people and it's not okay that's that and
then Gemma and I obviously went away for
us with my brand I'm so excited about
that it's going to be amazing I know you
guys will love this one where because
I'm really fussy with Korres with
swimwear with anything obviously
ah see that's why I'm getting my nose
done so I really just wanted to bring
out some swimwear that was suitable to
anyone's body you know really great
quality because I've been sent some
shockers and I just think to myself how
can people even sell this god I have to
be so careful what I say don't I I
remember when I did a part and I just
said in the caption like look at these
bikinis they're gaping on me does anyone
know how to make a decent bikini I
didn't mention any brands I didn't
mention any swimwear companies I didn't
mention what swimwear I was wearing but
obviously somewhere my breath got a
little bit offended and they thought
that I was attacking them which I wasn't
I'm not attacking anyone now I'm not
attacking any brands that I promoted
because I really promote brands that I
love so if you go onto my Instagram and
see clothes that I promoted or swimwear
that I promoted that's good quality
that's what I'm talking about but I'm
saying other companies that have sent me
staff it's just not been good enough so
it's just motivated me to make something
better another thing that I wanted to
address was lately I've been really
really down and just pretty much
depressed it's why I haven't been
filming because I'll film a video I
filmed two videos in the past week and I
sat down to edit it and just gone nah
and I've just been scared to like put
that out there because of how much I
compared myself to other people think
that social medias had a big part in how
I felt about myself lately because I'm
constantly comparing myself to
supermodels and to perfect looking
people I'm definitely going to stop that
once I get back from Sydney I'm just
going to focus on me and just focus on
being a good person and just focus on my
business and just focus on myself and
not compare myself to anyone else that's
the worst thing you can ever do in life
is compare yourself to what it appears
to be as a perfect person because that's
not real
none of that stuff you see on Instagram
is real like it's photoshopped it's fake
it's a picture okay
so yeah I've just decided that I'm going
to just stop comparing myself like he
was getting to the point it was so bad
it was getting to the point where I
would literally take a photo of myself
and then bring up a photo of someone
else and literally put the photos
together and go she's so much prettier
than me like why do we do this to
ourselves I don't know it's really got
to stop so I've made a promise to myself
that I'm not going to compare myself 21
I'm going to try as hard as I can to be
happy with who I am I'm sorry to anyone
who is offended by me saying this I know
that I am stupid ungrateful at times but
it's hard
Instagram makes you feel so shit about
yourselves and it almost forces you to
compare yourself with others I don't
want to be completely negative towards
Instagram because it's helped me a lot
with my career it's helped me you know
push the boundaries and go outside my
comfort zone and it's going to help me a
lot with my bikini business so I don't
want to be completely negative towards
Instagram but I just think that
sometimes too much social media is not
healthy for us if you do compare
yourself to others like I know that
that's so bad that I do that seriously
sometimes can't help it and I know it's
really crazy with me to do what I just
told you about that's me just being open
and honest with you guys I want others
to you know relate to me kind of just
know that it's okay and that I do it
true it's just really important to focus
on you focus on yourself be inspired by
people that you follow oh
they are love their photos be inspired
like I said just don't compare yourself
that's what I'm trying to say that's
what I basically just want to save you
guys dining from tomorrow I'll be
vlogging my whole experience of the nose
job the rhinoplasty if you guys would
like to see me vlog that experience and
make sure you give this video thumbs up
comment any questions you have below and

questions
in my vlogs I'm just trying to give you
guys as much information as I can again

I'm a sad person okay I'm going I'm
gonna go now I think I've covered
everything yeah sorry if you are
watching this video I love you you're
beautiful don't feel the need to go get
plastic surgery just cuz I am and if you
do look up to me if I am your
inspiration I'm not trying to send you
