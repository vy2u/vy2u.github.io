Skye my baby we play sky we live in
James beer I wanted to do something
different
exciting fun new different sorry when I
first met Michael Finch and we filmed a
video together I was like oh my god I
got the best idea for a video or why I
judge your music and you just mine he
was like what the you get out of my
house and I was like okay fine
it's gay it's not a cool idea but I
still think it was an amazing idea and
the other day when we were driving he
put his music on and he added his
Spotify favorites to my Spotify I don't
know anyway she just added his playlist
to mine which is April fades by Michael
Finch and I'm gonna be a really funny
video to film if I dislike played the
songs and gave my opinion on the song
because I like super fast even music
yeah as a particular style and I like
really girly like upbeat fun songs so
like Gavin a judge he's playing so let's
get to it first song is be careful cardi
B
yeah I think that I like that song yeah
okay it never fades away
hey stay you're just like oh yeah I'm
worried like everything just sounds good
on this Beko and I'm gonna like a little
bit but in my car it sounds different um
Miguel I do like that song because of
her he sings it I'm a massive fan of him
I didn't know he's up
it was Miguel so I was like a anime but
yeah I really liked that song because
Miguel is the right that
song was remind me to forget Kiger
Miguel is it the person I'm thinking of
I don't even our did excellently is a
lemon by drinking it's a remix
I mean it's okay it's not a song that I
would be like only let's put it on I
need a hair you know on me but yeah it's
okay I'd give it like a 5 out of 10
troll hurt somebody know our car Han I'm
not even gonna go that should I go that
thing it's not my style
okay Jo probably a lot of people would
hate me when I say this but I really
truly just hate songs that sound like Ed
Sheeran like I just can't get it into
their songs I love Ed Sheeran as a
person but I just I just over that
typical radio song you know anyone might
like a song comes on and you're like oh
I hate this song but you sing along to
it anyway that's one of Thrones so I'm
like next da okay next song is over
Doris by alessio Alyssa Caro
yeah I like that song I really like that
song effect everyone would know that
song I'm digging that song like it's a
really girly song but I am kind of over
it and I have intended to say to like
really kill song if I like it like I'll
literally play it ten times in a row and
it will be the only song that I listened
to for like a month and then I hate it
so anyone else do that I do that lucky
thank you time okay the next one is hard
to face reality sometimes it's hard to
face reality
