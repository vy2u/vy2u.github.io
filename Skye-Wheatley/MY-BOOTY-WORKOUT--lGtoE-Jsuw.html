channel today is a very exciting day
because guess what's coming right at you
it's my butt workout routine now please
don't judge me as I'm not a gym fanatic
and I do not know exactly what I'm doing
so you'll have to YouTube other people
doing this correctly because I'm
probably doing it a little wrong and my
forms not going to be the best big shout
out to camera and my boyfriend who
filmed this video I love you and I hope
you guys enjoy
okay so first things first you want to
do four sets of twelve deadlifts so my
feet are knee width apart I've got a
slight bend in my knees and I'm just
taking the bar as far down as I can go
and then squeezing my butt as I come up
you will feel the burn down the back of
your legs try to keep your back as
straight as possible when you are doing
this exercise to ensure you don't hurt
yourself now don't judge my dimples as I
squeeze my butt
it is not a toned but does our fat
ability but we're gonna fix it okay so
next we are moving on to four sets of
fifteen courtesy lunges now what you
want to do is take your back leg
diagonally behind you and drop your knee
to the floor if you are a beginner you
will just probably be better off
starting with the bar I have put a five
kilo weight on it watch out go me once
this is complete have a break get a
drink of water call your mum just joking
moving on to it that was not funny
moving on to hip thrust so for these you
want to have your feet in line with your
hips the bar on your hips as well you
want to drop your butt through the floor
and then push the bar up and squeeze
your butt these burn and I dislike these
very much but these are gonna give you
their bull day okay so moving on to
streamer squats have your feet facing
diagonally outwards grab a weight and
squat now as we squat we want to pulse
one as I come up I am squeezing my butt
and I am bringing out the brain but I
like to call it the brain but because
that is the amount of cellulite on my
butt and it looks like a brain when I
squeeze it PS we are also doing four
sets of fifteen
feel the burn embrace the burn wait for
the booty to grow okey-dokey moving on
to one and a quarter squats now I'm
doing this on the assisted squat rack
because a lesbianas uh needs support at
all times when doing this so we are
doing four sets of eight i've got a 5
kilo ring on each side so what you want
to do is drop your ass to the grass come
up halfway then drop it back down again
come back up and squeeze your glutes so
you want to be dropping your butt as low
as you can this will burn and if you're
not feeling it burn then you probably
need to up your weight if you are a
beginner then probably just start off
with the bar now moving on to four sets
of eight bar assisted lunges so you want
to take one leg back and then drop your
knee to the floor and repeat this eight
times on each leg for four sets and here
is the pretty dance because it is nearly
home time we have got one more exercise
to complete so get excited stay hydrated
and push through this girl you can do it
okay so we're doing four sets of fifteen
step ups grab some weights and a sweaty
roid bed place one foot on top of that
bringing your knee up to your breast and
then placing it back down and we're
doing this 15 times on each leg for four
sets
we have now come to the end of my booty

brooding exercises to show you guys so

you would like me to share them with you
