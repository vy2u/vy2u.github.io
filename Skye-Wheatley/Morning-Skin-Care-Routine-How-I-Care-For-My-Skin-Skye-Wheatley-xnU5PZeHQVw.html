going to show you my sign up morning
routine right now so look okay so the
first thing that I do is wet my face
with some cold water this just helps me
to wake the up and my face all
sorted to be wet so that I can cleanse
it properly next I just take about two
pumps of my Skinner true cleanser my
skin has really improved since using
this it really helps with any breakouts
that I have already so now for the fun
part I have this vanity planet
exfoliating spinning brush and it comes
with three heads so it comes with a
silicon head which is resistant against
bacteria build up an exfoliating head
and then also a soft cleansing head when
I have time I'll usually do a double
cleanse so you just softer brush hair to
just cleanse my face and get rid of any
dirt and oils then after that I will
switch to the silicon head to get a
deeper exfoliation also to clean the
brushes once I'm done I usually just run
them under hot water to kill any
bacteria flash dirt that it may have
picked up from my skin honestly you guys
my skin just feels so fresh and clean
like squeaky clean after abuses I've
also found that it really enhances the
absorption of my other skincare products
so once I've done my first cleanse I
will switch the brush head to the
silicon one and just repeat the process
okay so every once I Pat my skin dry I
go in with my Skinner true hydrating
spritz and I just sprayed this all over
my face down my neck and my deck potage
then while we're waiting for that dry we
don't do a happy dance cuz we happy malt
 you alright eh so moving on true I
cream this is a peptide eye cream and I
just take a little bit of that and Pat
it on the eye area
top and bottom don't forget your top
mobile lids ladies cuz that's gets very
saggy the eye area is Cuba delicate so
we really want to take care of that skin
around our eyes as soon as possible did
you know you should start using an eye
cream at eighteen years of age or maybe
it's 17 years of age you're not quite
sure but moving on to hydrating my face
I'm going to be using my multi bit from
Skinner true this stuff is seriously
amazing
all righty so once you're done admiring
yourself because who's gonna love you if
you don't love your sail you want to
brush your teeth so this is just like a
whitening toothpaste that you buy from
Kozel Willy's and then I give myself a
good scrub in the mouth let's just take
breakfast do you know what I mean and if
I didn't just eat breakfast my breath
would have been still okay and you need
to brush your chompers only brush the
teeth you wish to Kate okay so now for
my best-kept secret lanolin so the
purpose of lanolin is for breastfeeding
mothers we have thrusting nipples so
when I don't want crusty lips I use
lanolin anyway guys this is the end of
my morning routine I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you in
my next one make sure you give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel cause I'm watching you date
