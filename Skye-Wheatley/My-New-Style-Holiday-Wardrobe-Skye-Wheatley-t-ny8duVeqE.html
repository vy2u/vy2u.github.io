Scout mommy we LaHaye scam oh really
in today's video I'm going to filming
for you guys a white box boutique haul
which I'm super excited about because
they honestly have the cutest stuff and
I know if you guys have noticed but
lately my Styles changed so much and I'm
just like getting older I don't know I
feel like I'm into more cutesy clothes
rather than sexy clothes if that makes
sense they have the cutest stuff and I'm
about to show you guys what I picked up
from them let's get straight into the
video I will leave all the information
for white box boutique down below in the
description I do have a code you guys so
it will be down in the description box
as well as all the other information I
hope you guys enjoy this video and let's
get stuck I've got all the stuff that I
picked up yeah I think there's actually
more but I brought it all to Bali with
me so I could only fit a couple of items
I'm just gonna walk you guys through
what I brought to Bali yeah let's get
into it so the first item that I picked
up is this super cute polka dot dress
it's a really light fabric so it's
really great for the summer it's not too
hot not too heavy it's super lightweight
which I love and it just ties up at the
front so it's like um it kind of curves
a lot so if you notice cuts up like wrap
around and tie up on the side it's kind
of like that but it's a dress I got a
size extra small and hazard zip at the
back and alter has adjustable straps as
well not sure if you could get away with
wearing a bra with this one just because
the straps are so thin I mean I don't
wear bras
I've also it's not a problem for me but
if you guys did wear bras maybe you'd
want to get like a boob tube line so
they just feel like it looks a lot nicer
when there's only one simple strap you
know I'm saying
the next item that I picked up was just
a really cute miniskirt this is probably
my favorite piece out of all of them and
it's so so wearable especially here in
Bali because I've just been wearing it
with like a swimmer top or you know a
little crop top which I have heaps of so
it's just super easy it's just like a
plain skirt and then this comes around
and there's a tie that you put through
through the hole and you just tie it up
in a bar on the side like sir it's kind
of that linen fabric which I'm really
really loving lately I don't know why I
just feel like linen fabric is so in
right now
super super cute loving this but and
this is in extra small as well the next
thing that I picked up was this gingham
pattern top so it's just got two straps
and then you just tie it like stir into
a little bow at the front super obsessed
with this pattern lately like I've just
cannot get enough of this pattern no
matter what color it's in if it's just
Pat and I'm like oh girl I need that
you're gonna pair it with something I
wouldn't do anything too crazy on the
bottom because this is just so beautiful
in itself and it's got so much going on
that you just you don't need anything
else just something plain and simple
would complement this really well I also
got this in an extra I think extra small
is like a size six to eight and it's
also got adjustable straps moving on
through this sexy little number I'm
obsessed with this just a little yellow
linen dress again it has this wrapper
ball I don't know how to describe it but
it's like a wrapper Vuitton thing and
you just tie it up on the side stick
your cute smells like oil because I work
to a massage it's double wined you build
what it's not heavy it's not hot it's
perfect summer I pick to chuck on so so
comfy and convenient so I'm like living
for comfortable clothes lately and the
color is just it's sorry nice little sir
nice on dark skin like it'll look good
on a blonde
brunette or like black hair whatever
whatever color hair whatever color skin
I feel I can really implement anyone so
yeah I just love this color through
summary and so cute
I think I got an extra small and
absolutely everything but I'll let you
guys know anyway if it's not extra small
so the next thing I picked up is this
really cute little mustard skirt with
cute little fills on the bottom I feel
like these got a super fluttering just
make sure legs look so slim cause of all
the detail down the bottom so it's like
tight and hugging up until here and then
you have the cute little frills and it's
just honestly so cute so you
could pair this with like any plain tops
that you have any color that you think
might go there maybe a black crop or a
white crop anything really because it's
plain and simple and it's like that
stretching material I'd say this
material is a little heavier than the
linen material but again it's just super
comfy and super easy to just throw on
with whatever puffy for Bali if you
wanted to put like a bikini top with it
or if you wanted to dress it up or dress
it down and you can so that's an extra
small as well and then I got another
gingham style dress this is probably one
of my favorites it's so cute it just
reminds me of thee is it that a little
70s eight or the 90s got the gingham
style all the way to the bottom of the
dress and then it's got frills and then
Gangnam style but in like smaller checks
which I just love like this together is
so cute laughs it's so different
and unique also the color is like my
favorite ever and then it just ties up
here into two little birds or the
birthday at your shoulders and this is
in a size six I've got two more clothing
items and then I also picked up with you
bikinis which I'm super excited to show
you because they have definitely been my
favorite this whole Bali trip sorry the
next dress I got is this red little
number three cute most of stuff that I
got is like really frilly because I just
I'm really into thrills at the moment
yes give me a little bit of real
girlfriend so this is a beautiful red
color and it's got frills down the side
of the dress in the bottom and then
again it has a tie so you can tie it in
the middle at the back or on the side
it's got adjustable straps and then most
addresses have these little clip things
at the back as well and know if you can
say that to polite
easy comfortable all those things I love
go okay so the last piece of clothing
that I picked up is it's a really cute
true piece so it's a skirt and a top
yeah so the top is the same as the
little blue checkered one that I showed
you guys before so it just ties up at
the front into a little flower or a tie
then it has this stretchy material at
the back adjustable straps and then it's
got the grip here it ain't goin anywhere
wearing it on your body girl so yeah
it's just this really cute two-piece the
skirt is another one of those wraparound
so that that does the skirt and then
there's this extra bit of material that
you just put over the front of it and
tie it up at the side loving my frills
like I said I'm obsessed so that's that
one and that's in the size extra small
again I'm moving on to kini
so my favorite by far is this top that
I'm wearing now comes with matching
bottoms in a G bangle like this one but
it's just in this nice orange color so
this one which is gotta be my faith the
material is so soft and it's just such
great quality like the stitching and ER
I just feel like I'm all-in with this
you know what I mean like it sucks sucks
me in
if that makes sense so just super
comfortable and super fluttering on my
body so I also got this yellow pair as
well you guys might have seen it on my
Instagram if you follow me there whoops
so so stunning on tan skin it also makes
you look darker than you actually are
because of how bright it is
honestly yellow this yellow is seriously
one of my favorite colors when it comes
to clothes it's just so flattering and I
feel like it looks good on anyone anyway
so the back is just like crisscross and
then ties up when I look at these
bikinis I think island go gives me
snorkeling vibes so I got stopped bikini
and this is in the size extra small and
then I also got on earth this is a
different style different color
different style the top is the same in
these ones same front same back but the
bottoms are different they have this
little gathered up wide and what would
you say I don't know how to describe
this it's like it gathers you know what
I mean
what do you call this I don't know it
doesn't there's a word for it but I just
I don't know sir you can just look and
see for yourself they are the bottoms
it's cheeky cut I wouldn't say it's
completely J's going off your cheeks are
gonna hang out so girlfriend get ready
