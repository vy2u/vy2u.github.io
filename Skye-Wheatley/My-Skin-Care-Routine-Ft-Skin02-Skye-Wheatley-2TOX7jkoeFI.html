my channel is Gargery Wheatley it and I
don't owe on your free and tonight I
bring you my skimmer cane now this year
has been a long time coming
I've been manage to do this for so long
but I actually ran out of the props that
I've been using lately and then my skin
bathroom broke out and I was just so
busy that it was hard for me to get my
hands on another little product mainly
because I'm lazy and busy
I finally chopped up my favorite
products or what I've been using for the
last I say yeaaahh
oh yeah year or eight seven eight months
and my students instantly cleared up so
I was like oh my god I'm so passionate
about the skincare I absolutely love it
I was using like an all organic natural
2-step cleanser and moisturizer
I'll not support esj and after has
gotten older I just felt like I needed
more steps in my skin regime to kind of
help the things that I'm getting
concerned about as I get older and
absolutely loving the skincare that I'm
using at the moment it has clear backing
up so dramatically and when I stopped
using it I don't know I just break out
and my skin doesn't feel as healthy it
doesn't glow and it just seems so dull
and so I to share it with you guys
also I know you guys are kind of
probably asked with my glasses afar I'm
actually like those
well it's fashion Dameon output where
these go from in my description as well
as they you can get your hands on your
own skincare product that is jutsu for
anyone anyway let's get started okay so
the first thing is that I have to at the
end of the day is take off my makeup so
you want to take off your makeup for
your cleansing is good to make sure that
all the active ingredient in your
cleanser actually penetrating your
dermal layer right but you know I mean
you just want to have a clean place when
you go in and treat your food when
you're cleansing it now absolutely love
these each wife is enriched with aloe
vera environment eat help ballast
hydrate and nourish reference and turn
the skin so I just take one strip what
and remove my makeup before cleansing
the next step is gel cleanser I
absolutely love this stuff this cleanser
is great if you have oily skin it really
helps out and acne you have a new
justice or a bloody refreshed after you
cleanse your face with it like honestly
looking all of this comes off I've tied
all the punches and I Wi-Fi my cell
phone back to this one they also have
another sensor in their range that is
full really dressing so if you have
really dry flaky skin there's a cream
cleanser that house so I would probably
suggest getting that one also once a
week I use the collagen ma this is
pretty much like getting Botox is that
freaking good it just plumps the skin
hydrate your skin keep everything in
check they help promote reconstruction
of the students naturally collagen using
the bioactive mask for regular
treatments will smooth and regenerate
the skin from within look amazing
so once I've cleansed my
and I used this micro cream Africa Gras
and I do that at least one to two times
a week you know to have their own
dermabrush which you can use to get a
deeper exfoliation if you have sensitive
skin maybe build up to that and just use
the micro cream sir and then start by
going over your brush it kind of like an
aspirin microdermabrasion and then I
rinse my face with a hydrating sprint so
this is kind of just like a turn off you
can also use this to set your makeup
like once you've applied your makeup and
I can see that
Joey feel helps keep the bacteria away
and it just keeps you really hydrated or
he's next
oh yeah after I've used my ultra clear
sir
this would be to just drop that on to
you Thanks it is really good for like
imitation or discoloration in your skin
so this will definitely help to brafton
and hydrated skin the next turn I going
with this is like an actual students who
just want to get about four pulses are
up on your face and then just rub it in
but after I going with my multi-bit so
this is like a like a light and
moisturizer it's got all the vitamins
the skin needs to stay healthy it's
great for scars it's great for plumping
up the skin is great for fine lines and
wrinkles it's got be a C and E vitamin
and instantly Thompson hydrates the skin
I love love this stuff but I could not
live without it
it's the peptide eye cream it's just
helps with dark circles coloration
around the eyes and also helps with
those like your choir lines and
you get as you stop doing elasticity in
your skin if I'm feeling really dry it's
like the weather is changing or the
seasons are changing then I would use my
collagen renewal and this is for normal
to dry skin probably recommend this to
anyone who is concerned about dry flaky
skin or fine lines wrinkles or aging
because it's great for all of that if
you have acne prone skin then I probably
just declared you're just your arms and
your multi-bit and all that other stuff
because this may be a little bit too
oily you don't have the last of the
professional anyway I hope you guys
enjoy this fear at her status skincare
video has been helpful and also occurs
that and motivates you guys to look
after your skin because is so soft
wanting to look after your skin so that
understate useful and beautiful for as
long as you possibly can because nobody
one girl although like I love all people
and the show to you I don't want
to age like I'm so terrified of
aging so I can help my skin and my
laxity and collagen in my skin by
removing all these amazing products then
I'm gonna do that you know I'm saying is
like I'm gonna keep my skin in check
thank you make sure you give this video
a big thumbs up and you mean the world
to me if you join discover me
I'm such a loser and I love it I love it

another level of I love being a weirdo
vandalism a little every day when you
