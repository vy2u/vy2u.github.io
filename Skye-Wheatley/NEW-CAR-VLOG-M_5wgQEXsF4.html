Suzuki Swift we're taking you home hello
my beautiful people and welcome back
today is a really good day because my
car so excited I've never ever driven a
nice car before so this is like the
nicest thing I've ever driven like I've
always just used to driving around in
the biggest boxes sorry
this is pretty exciting to me not a
Range Rover it's not African Bentley or
anything oh anything crazy like that
the by oh but it is a really nice cute
little car for me I'm really really
excited and you guys are gonna share
this experience with me I love just
documenting my life like any people want
to watch my life that's close but really
I did em on YouTube so that when I'm
older I can look back on my life
it's the wheels in my face I forgot what
I was even saying now yeah it's just
good that I can look back when I'm older
on my life and be like wow
that is a good life okay that was really
annoying what's ya thinking earlier out
today I was thinking that in like five
to ten years it would be completely
normal for everyone to have a YouTube
channel it will be just like it'll be
just like Instagram oh my god this is
what I do it will be just like Instagram
where like everyone has one but some
people just have more subscribers than
others you know what I mean like will be
a normal thing it would be like Facebook
and Instagram we'll all have one i if i
lost
if I gained five five cents of every
five get you fine god no
oh my god if I got paid five cents every
time someone work someone got offended
I'd be like kid you not a millionaire I
would be the richest person on the
planet like why is everyone so easily
offended these days oh my god that's
offensive oh my god shut up grow some
balls mate grow some balls but oh honey
are you offended put a bandaid on it
no I'm not a racist person and you know
what if there are racist people out
there that is very sad yes I don't know
that there is but if someone were to be
racist towards me like who cares like I
can't change who I am I can't change
that I'm all Australia and I hate that
I'm all Aussie Park half the time I feel
like a rat bloody boy good night
but it is what it is just just don't
worry about other people and if you're
offended by that then
honey
that's why yeah I'm just having a little
I really feel like something to eat or
drink
always always feel like I need something
by now that's why I put so much weight
on in the Big Brother house cuz I like
was always wanting to eat just like get
water or something I feel like me to put
something about now fix that situation
okay welcome to trembling y Sun guys
it's so pretty oh my god it's so pretty
babe look at this sunset oh my god oh my
god you don't understand the footage I'm
getting right now oh my god it's so
pretty
that thanks cam hmm what's in it
melon water thank you did you see my
Instagram post no what was it I took
there not one my walls look at the
wheels the wheels babe oh my poor baby
the wheels are amazing they're rowdy do
you love the mad one
Matt oh my god they look so badass they
really probably ha ha
that would only happen to me man as for
sky sir guys I don't think I explained
to what happened I got my wheels um
powder coated with matte black oh my god
it's so beautiful and obsessed I thought
it was really unique and then I was
driving yesterday and I saw the exact
same car with these sacked same wheels
and the exact same matte black holes
like you can go die because I wanted
that to be like a thing but apparently
it was already a thing for the peoples
are thought I was being original but
whatever anyway so when they were doing
the Power Core eating of the wheels they
must have accidentally slashed one of
the tires so when I went to go pick the
car up
tie that one of the tires is flat so I
couldn't actually take it home one of
the ladies from zaps drove it to my
house and picked up a hire car on Monday
it is now Wednesday and I think in here
and that is sick
that's why I haven't been vlogging I'm
currently dying but this car is giving
me life right now anyway
bye guys I'll see you in my next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
