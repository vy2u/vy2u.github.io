so that will hopefully help relax me but
yet I miss fighting for the NHS is
finding to come through and put that
needle in me yes all right
not really I'm so nervous I'm more
nervous now than what I want getting my
boobs on just because I know that
there's risks that you take when game
surgery and I just hope that everything
goes swimmingly well fingers crossed
wish me luck bye look who picked me up
from the hospital hi fellow favorite
person okay that's good let's see my
face this is what I look like we are
killing a lot oh excuse me wept habit
wait Mikey have a nurse look off to you
okay we're going back to Belle's now I'm
in a little bit of pain but yeah
everything went well apparently
so large a thing very Bronx with the
dips up just hot as fuck
okay but hey guys sorry
oh I can't start dirty so it is Oh died
one off surgery
this is what I call in fact here cries
for no reason she
why does she cry is that why a bit like
me that okay yeah philia it's all goods
when I first got home last night and
took this off I started bawling my eyes
out
like I don't know why but it looks
really weird looks like a little pig
thighs
Oh sort of it looks good obviously I'm
swollen right now and you don't know
what it's going to look like until you
get your bandages off but it's still
scary because it just looks so different
I've very blocked my nose is very
blocked and congested last night when I
woke up it was super painful because
obviously he's brought my nostrils dead
so got stitches through here and up here
which means I'm gonna have to really
we'll come to that and start putting
scar cream on so that I don't have big
ugly scars
I can't shower over the sleeping all day
I hold face your sake so slowly but yet
it's so hard to see what it's put a
little clock with all this what I gotta
do wha
is it pavatt nori yes okay I'll go to go
dark oh I oh my god say bye okay bye
I'll talk to you guys tomorrow hi sexy
hey hater sorry
it is day two Oh God alright so much
pain like so much pain my faces will
spooling up even more years ago so it
just gets worse so yeah that's a little
update for today I've been sleeping all
day
oh my gosh I can't believe this bruising
yeah so moral of the story is it's very
painful and I've fallen okay even war
it's so hard to eat so I haven't had a
lot of food but valid I just go into the
shops now to get to cut it all cut it
all and yeah that's what we're doing
looks like a pig dies at the moment okay
I'll see you guys tour this is the
weather stat status little updates in
Mill and sky hey Bailey
hey guys a day three of recovery this is
what lookalike Wallace
great it's just not happening
yes sir day three
I've been putting peas on my eyes taking
painkillers I feel much better today but
my nose has not stopped bleeding
it's crazy anyway I'll see you guys
tomorrow for day four of recovery hello
lovers I look so ugly I'm so are we
looking at my face like this it's just
becoming a problem but anyway you got to
expect that when you get your face half
ripped up sorry this is day for a
recovery and it is looking much better
like I don't think I look as scary as
what I did in day 2 or 3 I hope you guys
aren't going to get stick with me do it
like an update every day I basically
just wanted to show you guys how we
progressively look I freaked out a lot
and I was thinking oh I got so big when
I look so big everything just looks so
not how it's going to look obviously
when you're not swollen everybody don't
have bruises and yeah when you don't
look like a zombie so I just wanted to
document it so people who decide to get
their nose don't know that
it's more for the swelling of the
bruising to make everything look super
out noble even my face feels so fat I
think it's like just all swollen anyway
so yes stable we went to the beach today
literally went to the beach looking like
this in 2d oh so yeah I think I'm just
going to go to sleep chart and just rest
up hey my face with ice and I've been
using this for the bruising
Oh see is stripping now again oh so just
been doing this constantly oh my god Oh
another thing that we're doing is spray
butter spray runners with this it's just
like saline salt spray you're supposed
to breathe it up you know is but I can't
do that because my nose just are blocked
and I've also been using this scar cream
the scars but as you can see that all
around here so yeah I'll see you guys
tomorrow
altar I just wanted to quickly tell you
guys that it's completely doable to get
super constipated from all like the
painkillers that they give you and the
an ethicist or I'm just going to have
one of these I've had one today already
but it did and it didn't do much you
really take your noise for granted like
I've taken breathing for granted I like
just me over like blur miners would be
so good but all yeah so it's normal to
get constipation with surgery with any
surgery happened when I got my boobs
done as well oh my god I so fake
saline everywhere you are like so fake I
can
/ oh my god what are you having done
next
haha charts but seriously Oh update you
guys throw if I end up going to the
toilet or not but I have no gone to the
toilet since surgery which was a
Wednesday it is now something it's day
six now just got back from June hi
I did go because you're lazy no let's be
honest you are a cow when they look like
this no one no one Bailey do you know
Haley is it a fan Hey
so yes makes it fair this is day six and
um still a little bit of bruising but
the swelling has gone down dramatically
which is amazing so I'm feeling good
today
not much feeling amazing
I had another panic attack last night
about my nose and like text my doctor's
wife like up guys like ten times and I'm
like oh my god is my nose is gonna be
pointy but yes I am okay today I'm calm
I'm relaxed
hey it really paid all the bills and was
just basically a badass adult and now
we're going to go take Bailey Shore walk
so I'll see you tomorrow cuz so it's day
seven
and I kid you not I am on the break is
that a word
I'm so on edge and I feel like I'm about
to have a mental breakdown like I'm so
anxious I've got so much anxiety that my
nose and what it's going to look like I
guess I just keep looking at it in the
class and it's really hard to engage
what it's going to actually look like
and yeah just a day full of anxiety
because tomorrow I get the split out and
phrase when the cost comes off and I'm
just really fucking nervous and I just
need this to be good because I can't
have a fucking botched nose and watch
boobs that would just be I feel like a
walking life lesson for a living which
is not very good for me maybe good for
everyone else but
like it was - it was getting to the
point where I was like shaking like
couldn't breathe properly that's how
anxious I am I don't even think I'll be
able to look at minorities I'm just
going to have to look at other people's
reactions to see if it's good on I swear
to God if it is not fucking perfect I
will not leave my house
first of all problem seriously balcony
put my life in perspective I need to put
my life into perspective this is not a
big deal why worry about it for me
perfect going to be amazing because you
and we're good okay see ya hey guys just
did milk makeup let's get a little
snapshot of that shall we
oh I'm good I'm good I'm so good yeah go
okay and then there's the other friends
like hi I'm just Tom tardy I'm just
trying to just look half as good as her
with the DOS
so this is day 8 of surgery this is what
it's looking like we're going to get my
splint out which I'm really nervous
about and you're going to have a
gorgeous learner's and it's going to be
fucking perfect and if it's not I'm
going to kill that one okay
last day of this on my face yay going to
get this taken off and I've never been
more nervous in my life so this is what
my scars look like they're not looking
good at all can't see that will heal
okay I'll see you guys when this is off
so this is my nerves
so swollen and I can't wait to tell you
guys what has fully happened to me
throughout this experience I'm going to
make a whole nother video reckon when I
can actually put makeup on and feel good
about myself
this is an art oh look I look like a
little piggy but it is a very very slow
length that's it from the side and it is
sore plenty and I was freaking out about
this bit but apparently it's just
swelling sorry will thing is the other
side it looks a little pointy than what
my nerves did before to surgery so I'm
like what the f but it's swelling sorry
I have to wait for it to go down to see
what it look like and then I'll chuck it
when you're going tomorrow
and yes I'm naked nothing wrong a little
bit Undertaker hey guys well it's really
bright so I'm going to stay back here
I'm going to go see my doctor because
I'm a little bit freaked out by this
NORs right now like I'm happy with it
but it's so long so that come down like
that and then I'll be happy um hopefully
it's just swelling obviously it's
probably just swelling so I'm not a I'm
not as anxious as what I was waiting for
the class to come off but let me tell
you this was the most traumatic
experience of my life so yeah just make
sure you know what you're in for
i rated jazz covered this skirt is suede
and it feels so nice anyway I don't know
how to use it settings on my camera and
it's too bright because I turned
something up because last night was way
too dark and now I just don't oh yeah

that's all normal
alright have it he definitely got rid of
that little and that I didn't like I'm
happy with it I just wanted to be would
you will be okay Susan hey hey didn't
think quick fall in love broken from the
start to our past
shit
hmm
I'm so happy to be home look Kayla got
two awards tonight on her dance concert
I'm so upset that I missed it
congratulations Kayla turn the one in
the right way silver come on let's get
makeup okay hey guys it's me even though
it doesn't look like me it is me
it's a next morning mom picked it up
from the airport last night I just had a
makeup client just then and now I'm
going to go back to bed tape my nose
because it is so swollen so swollen but
you know what I'm actually really happy
with it um
except from the side but I know that
that's swelling here because he did most
of the work in the tip so I'm just
massaging it and taping it every time I
go to bed you have to tape it for eight
hours a day to like keep it all in place
and I've just been like frantically
googling stuff about rhinoplasties which
is what I should have done in the first
place that I didn't freak out but when
does sky Wheatley ever do her research
never mind it's got really ever listened
in school never so I guess they're just
my consequences but yeah it is very very
swollen which is making it look a huge
huge but as I can see it go down each
day it gives me heart cuz I first I
hated it but I really like it from the
front just the sides are very swollen
so keep y'all updated hope this vlog
with interesting
it would be right because I look like a
pig oh my gosh what not I really love it
from the front just a little bit I've
had really bad insomnia and I haven't
been able to sleep very well it's a
super overcast day so I don't feel bad
about going back to bed anyway I'm going
to wrap this vlog up I just kind of
wanted you guys to see the healing
process I will do a I will feel me my
rhinoplasty experience video and give
you guys all the details um but I might
do that when my nose has gone down a
little bit more because it floats once
anyway I love you guys thanks for
watching and thank you guys for being so
supportive about me having plastic
surgery um I definitely think that it's
going to help with my confidence and
yeah I feel good about it so thank you
so much for the love I love you guys so
much I will see you in my next video
hello lovers it's me
formerly Wheatley and I thought I would
just quickly feel nice to put into my
rhinoplasty a diary vlog whatever the
hell you want to call that just because
my nose continues to get smaller each
and every day so I kind of just wanted
to show you guys what it's looking like
now I think it's been like two weeks
post-op um so it's a lot smaller than
what it was when I got the cast taken
off obviously it was huge when I got the
cast taken off and apparently it will
continue to shrink so here's what it
looks like from the side
I think it's shortened a little bit but
yeah apparently will continue to go down
even more so I just have to be patient
and wait to see the results I can still
feel that it's really swollen um
and it does take a long time to go down
obviously because they ripped my whole
face up huh cool so yeah I just wanted
to show you guys what it's look like
looking like now because it does look
really different to what it did the
other day when I was ending the vlog so
I will continue to keep you guys updated
on that so yeah um I'll continue to show
you guys what it looks like in the next
upcoming months obviously because I'll
be filming and you'll be able to see how
much it goes down story yeah thank you
guys so much for watching this vlog I
hope you guys found it interesting and
if you guys have any questions comment
below I'll be happy to answer them for
you I love you guys and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
