cocktail

can rest of the stirred on me and when
we walked in Shawnee had like this crop
top and like a pants on you can see the
tiniest bit of her midriff and they were
sober they were like oh sorry you can't
eat here you have to put like a jumper
on or you can't eat here it says
everywhere on the website and on the
signs outside that you can't wear crop
tops and that's fine like that's totally
fine that that's their rules and
regulations but they were so rude about
it
so we went in a tonight and then as we
walked out Shawnee took Michaels jumper
off and walked out as she as she was
when we got to the restaurant so that
was pretty funny thing was so rude like
the girls at the counter were like
talking underneath their breaths and
whatnot so we're like whatever we're
gonna give it right back to you it's not
like we live here you know what's really
good and the waiters really nice it was
just the truth two females at the front
