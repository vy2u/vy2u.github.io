let's get into it oh god of Leon stick
in her eye like literally there's
something in my eye
bunch Wow oh God well you guys just
something in my eye
I mean it's coming oh damn it
that's gonna bloody brain now I'm gonna
blade now I'm blazing what a disaster so
the first thing you want to do is get
your hair down in your face dick okay so
I'm going to start off by priming my
face and for my face I'm going to be
using the whole professional primer I
really need to stop swearing in my
videos but watch my videos in my my
girlfriend east-west touring the launch
with such a bother getting so true
though like I'm actually the biggest
burning up of a mate anyway I'm like yep
you gotta still spray that I might
that see you're
I swear it is not cool okay you want to
be sensible and you want to sound like
you have class even though you might not
you want to you know what you guys are
nothing was gonna do anything to my
brows because I got a new tinted and I
feel like they don't need doing a full
foundation with my Beauty Blender if
it's in the bathroom I'm gonna jump off
the naira stop blonde this combo
all along that's what someone comp oh

how good that everyone saying candle
stock nah yeah okay I'm seriously gonna

oxide booyah build blanket ball stop it
okay I'm going to be using my nod
radiant creamy concealer and this is in
the color medium truth ginger wait you
guys I'm literally a ginger like my hair
is actually got so many turns of orange
which I don't mind you know rather in
mind but it's just so dark compared to
blonde and I'm just so used to being a
blonde it's a bit traumatic but I'll be
fine okay like direct rock for me it's
 big problems in the world I wait
late
how about shut up how about and be
grateful huh no I am grateful it's just
it's so hard getting used to dark hair
after I've been so blonde all the blogs
out there will know what I'm talking
about but yeah my hair is like naturally
strawberry blonde so it throws off
really orange tones that's why I
if I leave my hair under and get a
column for ages it turns yellow and
orange I mean which isn't such a bad
thing I mean look at Lily she's a
merengue and she's killing it you know
what I mean so she actually kind of
inspires me to go my natural color
anyway moving on true powder going to be
using a magnitude by nature and this is
in the color medium skin tones I went to
the gym last night for the first time
and so long and it just made me realize
how like flabby and gross my body's like
I really need to stop taking care of my
body otherwise it ain't gonna look great
I mean the older you get the more things
start to Sag and sink okay and it's just
a way of life really like you just got
it you're just gonna put up with it
really getting rolled up up talking I
can sixty years old 23 anyway
ultimate I drastically circle eyebrows
I'm just going to brush them through
really quickly so that I took a really
natural feel if you need to fill your
eyebrows in and be my guest
don't do it the dog said get to it I
said we can't pee I got queen of the
world
whoa whoa yeah yeah if you need a powder
you Brown no one say no no one thing yes
no one's fussing you do whatever you
wanna do he deadhead okay I'm just gonna
brush my brows we get that powder out of
them so that they're a little fresh and
then I'm going to be going in with mine
gimme brow benefit benefit benefit I was
going to lightly brush that through my
brows make the head stick up like a
model
cuz I'm any Instagram model during love
with I like every single go has in that
buyer model and you like honey you go to
feed followers calm down
I'd never tell people that I'm a mother
like that's just embarrassing because
I'm clearly not a model like Naru I
don't have a model face I don't have a
model bottle bottle bottle my bump on my
mama I don't have a little buddy I don't
have a model anything like I'm just not
my model so mom and I tell people that
people ask me all the time are you a
model
no actually hate posing for photos I'm
not the biggest probably shouldn't be
telling people is oh my god I say my
such a down on my food gym and hate
taking photos I like taking photos but
when I'm feeling about myself
that's when I don't like it okay so for
either when you're with my modern
renascence palette and I'm just going to
be using a little bit of the burnt
orange color I'm just going to sweep
bathroom increase I have haven't really
bad idea HD you guys so if I if I start
on one subject and then move on to a
completely different thing that's why
because my brain that's just how it
works and yeah I just I have really bad
ADHD that's why I concentrate in school
because what I wasn't interested in -
that's just not how my brain works
nightmare my brain just doesn't work
like the normal average human you know
I'm different I'm different
yeah I'll get for it how the difference
y'all help your friend pull up a nominal
miss Iraq but I don't even know the
lyrics of yours okay so once you put
that in your crease you just want to get
a little bit more about orange and just
take that underneath your eyes I know
the thing that I wanted to talk to you
guys about was boys now I'm going
through a breakup and seriously it is
never easy but I feel like I feel like
if you feel that something's not right
I mean relationships are never easy and
you always have to work hard through you
know keep things the way that they were
when you first started dating but if you
have to force things then I just feel
like what
what's the actual point and if you
struggle with a guy not lacking you back
 move on honestly
see you later there's plenty of fish in
the sea drinking caught up on someone
who's not going to chase you who's not
gonna make you feel worthy like you are
special you are important you should be
loved you're an amazing human being you
have been placed on this earth to make
someone start happy and if it's not the
person that you want it to be at this
point in time forget about it move on
plenty of fish in sea and you know what
by you obsessing over someone or getting
caught up on your feelings for this one
person that doesn't like you back it's
closing doors and other opportunities to
come into your life take that from
someone who knows I mean there's been
plenty of times where I've been obsessed
about wait you haven't even known that
I've existence or what's the point like
why would I even get caught up on that
anyway for the lid color I'm going to be
using my morphe 350 palette and I'm
going to be going in with this shade
here like a copper bronzy burgundy
bloody how you gon shimmery bronze II
got out
billy-bob color so I'm just going to be
packing that on my lid yeah that's a lot
got a lot a lot oh my god these frickin
colors I'll start people into it oh look
see yah what I want to be yeah I hate
seeing my friends get upset as of ways
because my word look at your life you
are so beautiful you're successful
you're kind of the best biggest baddest
 on base ha you don't have
to be caught up on someone who's not
gonna love you see oh all out everywhere
bye okay so do your eyes away for for
your foundation kids that's it for the
eyes that I'm gonna Duke you guys that's
it for the iLab that's it for the
guys it's the ice guys gonna move out
Brown for governor Browns nothing so
Browns I'm using the lot by benefit this
is my favorite from Zepa
and then a little bit onto the forehead
around the hairline cuz that's where the
Sun would naturally hit me if I ever saw
the Sun I am so binary it's actually a
joke I can't handle not having thanked
him and like I just absolutely hate
myself if I turn on Tamara I'm like who
are you why are you in my house while
you're in my bedroom
get the out of my house put some
tan on it and then you can come back the
mascara I'm going to be using my origins
and gins in mascara I'm sick of trying
to hide this crack here I am actually
over it yes there anyway also saying
about the boys situation if you hop up
on someone who's not hung up on you
who's literally wasting your time don't
think in your head oh I'm gonna manifest
stuff this boy lacks me or I'm gonna I'm
gonna make him like me you can't make
anyone like you - trust me I've tried
I've tried to make people like me
they're not gonna like you she's just in
pool is that like you can't have that
mindset of oh I'm going to make this guy
fall in love with me like I thought like
that before and we've all thought like
that because yeah would be nice
to have the person that you want but
last not all about that because that
person that you want may not be the best
person for you you may think that they
would be but they're probably not I mean
life always works out okay if you trust
in the universe if you trust in yourself
and love yourself then good things will
come to you and
ow - gather for a boy that doesn't like
you back you move on you find a new way
to like a new boy that will see you for
everything that you are and a new boy
that will appreciate you I mean you can
still be friends with this other person
and you don't have to hate them that's
not what I'm saying at all that's what
they're doing now lice and do you you do
