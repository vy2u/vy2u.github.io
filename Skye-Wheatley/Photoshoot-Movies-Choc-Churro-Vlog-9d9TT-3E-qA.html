was just trying to get a further in
these earrings but they're absolutely
absolutely to die for
would you agree or disagree anyway

pop I just might just get so so badly
irritated from wearing earrings like I
never wear earring but last night I went
to the princess Holly event and we're on
a boat and it was super windy and I'll
bring these heavy and the wind
was like blowing them at my earlobe or
in a lot of pain I can tell you that
right now
he was making you real simple
oh you're a home uh-huh Emily okay
actually made to put the footage from
last night in this world because it is
that funny like I was so drunk
last night and my head hurts so badly
today and I have a photo shoot and like
I said to myself I'm not going to get
drunk like I'm not I'm not going to do
that to my body I had to wake up so
early to do my makeup thing called my
hair's already done but um yeah it was
free cocktails and I just I literally
can't control myself it's like a bad kid
in a candy toy Oh cheeseburger I
just
I can't not drink if it's free it's like
I can't not eat food if it's free
tuition okay bye okay okay I'm going

pleased
we're going to go get Mexican and I'll
show you when we get there

all cameras fixed my ring light for me
and they'd stand off mazing absolutely
amazing surprise we are going to
photograph some of my clothes so that I
can sell them to whoever wants to buy
them and then we're going to go to the
movies hmm exciting so that's how you
sit up
hey guys sir today is she's in a super
lazy day I know what the weather's going
is lately but it ain't happening like
it's just it's rained it rained it
rained and now it's not raining anymore
sorry my nose is so itchy
what is up it's not raining anymore but
it's just super dull and overcast and
super super windy has been so hot here

where your ass coming from girl cuz I
Mildred you up in here open up this hill
today when I work hot in the weather
felt so fresh and crisp so I see Lincoln
around the water I am soaking for winter

so yeah it's just kind of really dull
and gloomy and meaning an enemy
I always forget to end my vlog so this
is like the end of the vlog is edited I
love Monday's like i just chill and do
all my emails and and it we are so I'm
just yeah have not left out of my PJs
I also last night at the movies cam and
I went and saw Beauty Beauty and the
Beast and it's like it's like a musical
like they have heaps of singing parts in
it which I didn't expect I didn't think
that they would have all the singing
that they did in it but they did anyway
I still enjoyed it but these two women
behind camera were literally talking
through the whole movie and I
tell you what that is so annoying I had
never experienced it before because
normally go I'm saying maybe you don't
 talk the whole way through you
know I'm saying that they were behind us
and they would just say and then when
the singing parts would come on they
would get louder and louder and louder
and cameras like turning around thinking
what the hell like why is no I'm saying
anything to these bitches like they're
literally talking through the whole
entire movie I was really annoying
because like you know you're really
going into a movie you're trying to
listen to what the people in the movie
is saying and then you can hear like
little annoying voices in the
background that's what was like and I
might camp on a ring serious and he's
like he kept turning around and looking
at them in certain eye like so they
might maybe shut up but they didn't so
cam was like
really loudly and then apparently one of
the girls was like cheers mate and then
they kept talking so like not and then I
just turned around looked at them and I
was like can you please be quiet like
you have been talking the whole movie
and she's like ah it was just from out
the song and I might know the whole
movie you have not stopped like be quiet
thank you the May it was I would just
couldn't believe it like I wouldn't you
go out to dinner like they were
obviously true old friends catching up
you know catching up on stuff but we're
looking out tonight if you want to chat
drink up your Rudy until your whole
pretty life story while other people are
trying to relax and listen and watch a
freaking movie general fan
oh my god I can't believe some people I
can't believe it
that was my movie experience at night
okay so I also wanted to tell you guys
before you went to the movies you went
and had dinner and honors at harbajan oh
my god they have the best freaking food
you'll ever try in your life like I'm
obsessed with Nonna's I have the best
cocktails that pits like best best paces
I'm trying not to like think about it
because I'm literally going to greedy
along but um yet we went to Norfolk girl
and then there's this new life to
replace it harbortown and I know it's
like I was throwing chocolate joint so I
was like wanting to try it for so long
so cam and I went there and had dessert
worst churros I've ever tried in
my life like they were like so so
crunchy and everybody knows everyone who
knows me knows that I'm really like I'm
not afraid to complain if I go to jannat
so I go to lunch if I get a drink
that's not blended properly like for
McDonald's or gerace's or wearable I'll
ask them to remake it and I'll tell them
that I don't like it so anyway can I cut
these truths
and they was so so crunchy like it hurt
my mouth to bite into them and normally
like Torres ass or assault like if you
guys Badgers they're supposed to be soft
right
anyway I walked up to them I said
Cameron I'm going to complain like I
don't like features and Halle gave me
any chocolate so I walked up there and I
might be excuse me like this sure is a
weird I'm like are they meant to be soft
or crunchy and then lady was like alters
are different as skinny alpha gosh back
would you like money back a month
no that's fine I'm just not going to
worry about it like I felt bad getting
my money back cause we we'd already
eaten true true to our age and I ate all
the chocolate mmm the chocolate is fine
but yeah just letting you guys know if
you go there nature is like crunchy
crunchy like it like you know this
really crunchy crackers you get they're
more crunchy than a cracker and
it's just not meant to be that salt
water is also the Salafis Harbach are
