like I haven't done a sit-down video in
so long and I wanted to just touch base
with you guys catch you up on what's
been happening or like just fill you in
on what you want to know all right let's
get started
I literally just wasted about an hour
trying to get the lights right and I
went I came the other day and spent like
a ton of money trying to do this
background bought this really cute chair
and you can't even see it you cannot
even say it I don't know I don't even
know I don't know okay I'm at Lucky's
right now I'm in my spare room that he's
kindly said I can store all my in
which is like so lovely oh my god best
boyfriend ever
hello up my boyfriend I'm still not sure
about my background I have something way
cooler in my head but it just wasn't
gonna work I haven't actually taken the
tags off these flowers because I don't
know if I want them there we've got this
really cool painting that I could hang
up in the background there and then have
like a kilo Peppa I don't know her I
don't know what I'm driving but if you
guys are vibing this background like
lemon or it cuz ya'll have to look at it
so do I actually
I'm editing
and just like leave your opinions
in the description which I know y'all
will know what I'm loving that every
time I post a video it does this one
really cool cat who comments on my
videos and says I'm really hot for a
trans girl
shoutout to you buddy that's dedication
every single video high-five
let's start with the first question I'm
just going to answer the more personal
question it's so scary cuz like it is my
channel first embarrassing thing to
happen to me I think I've already talked
about this on my channel but I shut
myself a couple times
oh that's right in Bali oh my god this
is so funniest story so like when I say
I've shot myself a couple of times like
it's happen more than once very
embarrassing
anyway in Bali this is the most recent
time at shot mine's old fryer and I was
taking further and I just put this
really cute like white paste truce that
white paste on and I was like yeah this
is gonna be sick I'm gonna get the
coolest sexiest martyr looks like Fred
you guys said they'll take your photo
see what it looks like sorry just after
I click the photo taken of her I went to
go pass her the camera and my view I had
the worst runs in Bali like I could not
stop I know this is really
gross guys felt like I'm an open book
and I will seriously discuss anything
and everything with you on my channel so
if you don't like it there's the door
there's the door there's the door okay
anyway had the worst diarrhea in Bali
just don't like the food and I was
brushing my teeth with the water and I
don't worry
I guess just different atmosphere in
different countries you know so yeah I
just literally could not control this
diarrhea coming up my butt and it went
all over my white bottom which was
really upset about
thankfully they have washing machines
there actually no we were on Lam bogan
we're on chatting in actually yeah
that's probably the worst thing
is a moment I've had in a long time
because normally you can control only
you can control poop coming out your
butt but I couldn't that time I could
not oh that would have annoyed me I
don't know it some of you as well yeah I
just could not control it super
embarrassing grace burn thanks for the
question Euro babe next question is from
Mads Lamont what would you be doing if
you weren't on YouTube while doing
makeup that's the thing I literally
would be screwed if I didn't have this
is a career and if I couldn't do makeup
but if I wasn't good at makeup then I
literally don't know what I would be
doing before boobarella I was working in
a coffee shop so I probably just be
making copies which is like not a goal I
would want to have for my future so yeah
obviously don't have the desire to go to
uni if you do good on you I seriously
have so much respect for you because
that would be so hard I'm like
super ADHD right like I cannot
concentrate on anything I can't even
concentrate on my emails yeah uni we're
just not be for me I would seriously
suck at it whatever it when do you want
to have kids and these questions from
Chase Murray I would be happy to have a
baby like right now right now look if I
got pregnant I've researched drugstore
happy Lucky's gonna together I'm
like slowly getting ready to give up I
don't know I'm sure I'd get my
together if I had a baby in my stomach
sir yeah I don't know I'm like ready
whenever happens and like whatever is
meant to be will be so if it happens
then it probably meant to be that I have
a baby right now and settle down I
wanted to be a young mom I'm 24 turn
train for this year and like I really
would have liked to have had babies
earlier on but it just didn't happen and
you I find the right person to settle
down with sorry but yeah I'd be having
our babies like within the next 2-3
years question from street under school
girls do speak to anyone from Big
Brother still and how are you cookie I
am good
Chuck and Nora actually don't speak to
anyone for big fella
bow-bow I don't think I don't know
actually I can't speak for them but I'm
not sure
and he handsome capable contact I
personally don't keep in contact because
I struggle to anything capable contact
with my friends let her learn a bunch of
strangers that I experienced that crazy
experience with and I all sounds really
bad but like people have their own lives
and life gets really really busy and
hectic and is seriously hot enough just
keeping up with your actual real life
friends in real life in the real world
do you know what I mean I don't know I
feel like it's an adult thing it's so
much easier like have your best friends
and your friends that you go to school
with every day because she's seeing them
every day and then when you graduate or
like whatever you're not going to school
and you're not seeing your friends
everyday like your true friends will be
the friends that you can talk to you
after like two years time and be like
hey I miss you how things been and you
can literally just pick up conversation
stop talking like there was never any
time spent apart they are your real
friends but yeah I don't know I don't I
haven't really reached out and tried to
make contact with anyone from Big
Brother I did kind of catch up with
Jason a little bit after the show and I
don't think it would be awkward if I
overlapped into any of them on the
street I'd probably go for a drink with
them but no I just don't keep him
contacted them like I'm literally flat
out trying to give my boyfriend the love
and affection that he needs as well as
our dog yeah chi-ching swimming this
question is from Leah Hussey healthy
where do you see yourself in five years
um hopefully with big fuck-off mentioned
three three kids married to lucky of
course maybe another little sausage dog
and yeah just like living happily ever
after like that's just literally all I
want yeah that would be goals this book
just to like be stable and not have to
worry about money not have to stress
about it and just be like really
comfortable and in routine with my
husband and my children and my animals
that would be amazing
Nuala fratello where's your next holiday
well I got asked to go to Fiji today
that might be happening see what Lachlan
has to say about that yeah I don't know
but I'm going to Bali with lucky in
April that's gonna be super exciting
because it'll be our first holiday away
together yay and then we're also going
to the snow at the end of the year so
that would be amazing also excited are
we my first time thinks new another
question from the same girl is Winston
yours or Lucky's pup
he's luckiest dog yeah I'm like the sole
carer
because lucky goes to work every day and
I'm with Winnie all day here at home so
yeah I'm pretty much his mama and what's
what sakis is mine right cause we're
like married and so taz min Lilly
what do you do day in day out explain
your daily routine do you get bored
absolutely not I do not get bored
I've got like too much going on in
my mind to get bored I'm just a major
stress off so if there's like one task
that I have to get done like I don't
feel like 10 tasks to me I'm like I'm
slower than your average human like just
to film this video have taken me half a
day like to set up do my head you're my
makeup get the lighting right get the
tripod set up get the background how I
want it I'm just like such a prat such a
massive procrastinator so it's like
really hard for me to get things done
because then the normal human like I
don't even know like I don't even know
about my time guards a daily routine for
me would be like get up make the bed
maybe have a shower eat food unpack the
dishwasher put the dishwasher on if it
needs doing maybe do like alert washing
do my emails clean my mess because I
like literally leave a trail of
destruction everywhere I guards or the
path true Knights I've actually been
like cooking dinner which is pretty
scary because like I don't cook I
seriously do not cook and I burnt the
stove the other day but I made the last
guy noodle soup and then I put noodles
in in it
soak up all the soup so it wasn't even
really a soup it was just like noodles
and vegetables but it was still good it
was yummy I'm learning and then like all
film or edit a video so yeah pretty much
whatever I want
basically f45
is always usually in my routine but ever
since I got back from Mauritius I've
just been like chilling out and just
taking time to unwind because that trip
was like to really full-on like or
taking photos every single day and I got
to experience what it's like for models
taking photos every day it was it was
hectic it was like really good like I
love being busy and I love getting told
what to do because then I actually get
it done faster whereas for me I work for
myself I do all my from home I
decide what to do when I do it and
there's just like no no proper routine
that's why I like me to sit down and
fully like plan out my days which is
what I am planning on doing I'll film an
updated morning routine daily routine
video for you guys once I get my life
sorted but with traveling so much lately
I think it's a bit hard on her it's just
hard to be routine when you're
constantly packing and unpacking not
that I don't love traveling like I
honestly love traveling I'm so grateful
to get to see you know right the walls
Hilary yeah have you I wrote one and
then I just didn't send it but why do I
always have to say sorry okay noted I
can't have a good day love you bye
I don't even know a thing I'm a psycho
you're a psycho make sure you subscribe
and you can join the club
okay Tasman Lily same girl whether you
get your money from I get paid from
Instagram and YouTube and like what I do
people's makeup that's obviously income
for me but yeah you get paid from ads on
YouTube you know how like YouTube puts
an ad at the start of your video you get
paid from that I mean it's not much but
it's something you know what I'm saying
and my rates for Instagram I just I
definitely don't get paid what I should
be getting paid but what I thought girl
needs to live and she needs to go
grocery shopping every week because she
lives with her husband now kind of
actually I don't know it's not really
official as men Lily do you do you like
what you do yes I absolutely love
working for myself I love my job I'm
very grateful for all of you guys hey
sorry my card was a bit full how to
delete some but we're back
welcome back over enjoying it so far
moving on to the next question one
what's your dream job
I actually am doing my dream job right
now I've never really was into YouTube
and then I watched a few videos and I'm
just sure that I was a career for people
and then I was like you know what that's
what I want to do I want to make videos
I'm gonna be able to work for myself I
want to travel I want to make lifestyle
video and Here I am obviously I still
want to just keep climbing to the top
and get better and better and better I
don't know it's crazy what can happen
when you set goals
honestly like no matter what you want to
do in life write it down and make a plan
to get there make it a goal of yours and
it will get really happen like there's
been so many times where I've just
manifested things that I've wanted in
life I believe that I manifested lucky I
believe that I manifested manifested
levinthal again I believe that I've
manifested my boyfriend I believe that I
manifested the experience that I got to
have him Big Brother I manifested that
whole experience for myself and I've
manifested my career as well like I just
made it a goal and worked hard to get
there and I believe that any one of you
guys can do that as well so just have a
goal in mind imagine it work towards it
every single day and you will get there
like that's what life is learning that
you are in God you create your own
reality like it is seriously that's the
best advice I can give you want
something you make it happen and
it will last words of wisdom with
Gabourey we may help last words with her
with yeah Marie Whitman when are you
getting married
when he pops the question okay seriously
 stop winking bitch I'm over it
nella
fratello who is your style sash fashion
icon to be honest I just kind of I don't
really stalk people and like copy their
fashion I just pick things that I like
but my number one favorite clothing
brand at the moment is blossoms like I'm
this is glasses I'm literally obsessed
with everything they have I feel like my
Styles changed a lot since last year
really over the clubbing look you know
like I'd prefer to wear something cute
and flowy and like comfortable I didn't
matter only wear heels anymore I just
wear flats so I like anything that will
look cute with flats it's nothing you
know what I mean naturally a grosser do
you regret anything about your
relationship I feel like when you first
start dating someone everything within
the first month is what cements the rest
of your relationship never put them down
don't have really high expectations I
feel like walking and I was so diff
and at the side of our relationship I
would say things that would offend him
and then he would you know like give me
a taste of my own medicine then I'd be
like oh my god that's very hurtful and
he's like well you do it to me I just
believe that you seriously should not my
games like playing games is the worst
thing you can ever do I regret getting
really angry at him for stupid
because then we spend more time arguing
than loving each other laughter I regret
not just letting go of things that he
said that upset me but then again you
need to talk about things that upset you
eugie open and honest with your partner
and just talk about things and you know
what I do regret in my last relationship
always just breaking up with him if we
would have a fight like we would have an
argument and I'd be like yous over
breaking up and like that is your single
to answer and I know that now coming
into this new relationship that if we
fight I'm not gonna ever say you
I'm done and like pack all my and
leave you know really break up I don't
think that's right I feel like you
should always work three things and
always gonna have arguments I mean it's
like literally healthy too argument too
argument
it's literally healthy to argue in every
relationship that you're in you're gonna
disagree no one is the same role unique
beings obviously we're gonna have
different opinions and we just kind of
need to learn to respect that and kind
of like walk away to resolve a problem
calmly I should seriously take my own
advice cousin seriously it's not good
but sometimes our New START angry you
can't help it
av grouse brim sorry if I'm not
pronouncing your name correctly do you
want any more pets yes I really want to
get another Winnie
I think lucky might want my
collaborative I don't know a big talker
pea soup with you like big dogs are just
more placid we box at every
strange job if I go out on the street
and he comes
come with me and the neighbors outside
who run up to them and leg back their
ankles it's just not cool it's really
not cool and I feel like a big dog
wouldn't do that but I feel like it's
been whinnies upbringing maybe like he's
been moved around a lot so maybe that's
why he does that I don't honored more I
wasn't there for his upbringing so I
can't talk I don't want a dog that's
like that like I don't want children
that aren't friendly and I don't want
pets that I'm not friendly you know like
he's sure the most lovable beautiful dog
in the world but he just he doesn't five
strangers he just does not vibe people
that he doesn't know until he gets to
know you like when I first met him I got
into Lucky's car and I went to pat him
and I kid you not he went to eat
my hand but like I wasn't scared of him
most people are like oh my he's this
bake relax he's not gonna eat you you
mean could either be a man and step the
 off and tell him who is BOTS but
yeah I would definitely like another dog
I think we just want we need to have a
friend like it'd be nice for him to have
a lover he needs a friend of his own
species you know Billy Moody what did
you do before YouTube I actually worked
in a salon a beauty salon both doing
like pedicures massages facials oh that
Jack yeah after that I went into making
copies dollars a barista at Sur office
coffee I got fired from gerace's harbor
town for turning the music up that
wasn't the real reason I just hated me
but like hello I could've totally taken
your officer Bell life but I didn't
cackles like I've got accepted up to Big
Brother so you oh my god I'm sorry
I'm going
I think they fired me it's two or three
weeks before I've gone into big fella
but I was like whatever I have savings I
don't need your money bitch I'm about to
go on TV watch me on TV bitches
but like sigh starboard firing someone
because they turned the music off like
it was literally I'm not I couldn't hear
the music at all so I went out the back
and I turned it up like a notch boom
you're fired
what you say what up sometimes
workplaces can be so nasty and it's like
a bit of a high school feel when there's
like bullies there's like leaders it's
like the popular one and that's like
there's a lot of bullying that goes on
so and that
tarah underscore Smith what got you into
youtuber makeup I feel like I got into
YouTube first and then I was like oh I
really want to do a makeup call forgot
my makeup skills are better for YouTube
left for filming makeup tutorials and
ourselves actually YouTube that got me
into makeup
Alysha of fazil ii favorite childhood
memory probably like just going to
Adelaide and seeing my grandparents my
mom when I was little and just like
Kayla being a baby and me being how old
I was I think I was like 12 when kayla
was a baby 10 or 11 under
but we just like always play we'd stay
up late and put music on and just be a
happy family like it was like three
musketeers and was just the best
Lucy Brownlow 7 hey babe what made you
decide to start your channel and become
a famous youtuber I think what made me
want to start my channel was so you guys
could get to know me more I mean I
didn't become famous from like taking
really cool photos and being like a
really pretty girl on Instagram I became
famous through big Bella
which is like my personality so I was
like why not continue doing what I
became famous for in the first place and
that was being sky wheelie yeah
goal no but yeah that's why I was just
like you know what I just want to share
myself and it's seriously better and you
don't know well I love watching old
videos back it's like wow like imagine
how cool will be when I'm older and
showing my kids like look at mommy when
she was your age like doing YouTube
videos and I guess
myself out there again and reconnecting
with you guys if you will I'll answer
one more question Ruby Retief if you
want kids do you want your first to be a
girl or a boy what would you name it
so looking and I have decided on the
name that we both like but saved up for
a video I definitely or one boy first
like I just I really want a baby boy I
would love to have a baby boy and I'm
scared if I had a girl she'd be psycho
like me and I'm like you know what I
think I need a boy baby first to just
like practice being a mum and then
actually maybe boys are more crazy when
they know that I don't know but I would
just love to have a boy first and then I
go but like I'm really happy as long as
my baby's super healthy that's all that
matters yeah I would definitely like to
have both sexes because I mean what girl
doesn't want to have a boy and a girl I
mean you want to experience both don't
you but like you'd be happy to just have
healthy babies so yeah
don't answer that question anyway guys
thank you so much for watching I hope
