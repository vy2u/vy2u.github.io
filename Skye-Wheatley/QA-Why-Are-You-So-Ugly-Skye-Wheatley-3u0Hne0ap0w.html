don't manage youtuber but I think they
should do less of Big Brother YouTube
influence our outlet and have all those
youtubers in a half and be so so funny
and there will literally be so much
drama so much gossip
it would be the best TV show ever like
someone needs to get that going and put
me in the house even though I think
should you not like I need to be a medic
a little my VR I pull it out all the
matter like don't have the Big Brother
house with like all these friends
youtubers and they would still like true
nominating and everything but they would
have like YouTube challenges like they
would have let task for the youtubers to
make specific videos and the best video
win and they would still last be putting
content out
you guys but it would be in the house
and they will be living together it
would just be the best tip it's our past
you missing on be father and son you
