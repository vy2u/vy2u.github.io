straight into it first things first I
primed my face with the full
professional primer from benefit and I
just use a stippling brush to apply bit
comedy
okay social foundation I'm using my
still uh failed a foundation concealer
and it comes with like this little
screen applicator so I'm just applying
this on my face just dabbing on and then
blending in with my Beauty Blender also
this is in the color q5 okay so once
you've blended that out you're going to
apply some powder I'm just using my new
friend answer on my Huxley's full makeup
storm brush and I'm just applying that
in circular motion PS I'm skipping
concealer because I'm gonna mad rush
girl and in Liberec our temple we're
going to warm up your face with some
bronzer I'm using my bronzing Mac powder
in the color 1/16 and I'm also using my
angled brush from hospital makeup I'm
applying this on my cheek bone around my
forehead and my jaw line
okay starting next to something super
simple quick and easy on the eyes I'm
going to join me with that same bronzer
and just washing that all through my lid
and up through my brows also with the
leftover products I had on my breath I'm
just taking that Brown this off my nose
just to give that a little bit of a snap
effect so as you can see I'm really not
putting a lot of effort in I'm just
doing a quick and easy so for brows I'm
going to be using my brow gel and it's
by Iker London so yeah I'm a just a
brush and my brows out go fine next we
are going to be curling our eyelashes
just for that cute little boost you know
what I'm saying
next for the best car in the world
I literally swear by this it's the
origin gin zinc mooska it is amazing and
last but not least the lip gloss I'm
using the essence xxs a whole need lip
gloss and I just love the soft colors
not only is it a cool off it has like a
little bit of a nude pink to it and it's
hot okay

I'm going in with my back off highlight
up and it's in the color champagne top

freaking amazing also get frosted by
