knocking good like maybe in both holes
please forgive anyone the most valuable
advice you cabinet in your whole entire
life it would be simply this never ever
ever talk to an ex-boyfriend because one
it's your ex-boyfriend - that's in the
past 3 you have them for a reason or you
need to move on with your life
nothing have a good content or team two
exes especially one that engages with
you like 12 because you were 12
now you're then you have more knowledge
and wisdom and you're not a
idiot but they still are so joy talk to
them okay
remark right above that other way today
I'm going to be showing you guys through
all the math like with the stick I'm
scary and showing you what the colors
look like on m'lip
this is what the packaging looks like
I'll just fix colors and the colors are
maybe Jerry Brown cheeky candy chica and
buy and they also have a liberator to
help you get the product off
number one is Lady Jaye a beautiful
bright red color
well got a soapie brighter than my
future how about that
hope you sorry of my camera kept saying
gospel that I've deleted all videos also
now so with lipstick guard also I have
Botox under this eyebrows like lift it
up and like only one because this
eyebrow needs to be higher than this
eyebrow but now this adults are high and
this one is not and there aren't even

come up like this it just like come up a
little bit yeah Thank You Doris Oh get

you don't touch a face when it
doesn't need to be touched
okay for this is the red color freakin
strong room I love it oh my god yes
plenty nicer than hanging out with Freya
way too long this is one one layer of
the Lady Jaye so amazing oh my lips dry
really quickly just ignore magnification
guys the thing that I really like about
this color is that it's not streaky with
my liquids fixer right streaky only to
go over them so much the application
ones is perfect so easy to apply it
doesn't have any sense at all
this color leave me legislators essays
like like well can you see that it's not
drying my lips at all
so would you drink that
oh just a little tiny bit came off and
off you guys into better ostrich under
where it's probably still wet so overall
that's pretty freakin good I am very
very happy that try
me mr. Raisa have a little Java Bowl
application and I guess you just apply
it like the little well try not to eat
it I'm also going to do your Frank's

smell is Lucien ops not gonna go
anywhere if we were if anywhere
yeah wow that actually really were I'm
around and this everywhere
okay we're moving on to the next color
which is so true brown is like a really
dark brown color
if anyone judges my application right
now you probably weren't going to heaven
unless you say not because judging is
not cool because okay you know lovely
name so this is one crisp of true brown
stunning head we're all good
nothing here nothing here nothing you
did nothing there
okay okay by doing surface with these
colors they definitely do not feel
drying on the list what so I'm bluffing
the colors this the name ah I'm going to
get really sick and really spiritual
guys just letting your honor
keep that in mind okay that's what's
happening and you're welcome to come
along for the journey I don't like this
color it's so stunning okay I'm gonna
take this off I'll show you one more
time how the lip eraser works my cameras

month you know yes

chica on vision on fire next because
it's bright and then we've got like the
light of colors so we'll get the bright
colors dumpster oh love that sort me

used to wear and develop all the time oh
my god I'm in love I'm legit in world
with life and this liquid lipstick and
I'm also like in love like Iman
you know when something happens in your
life and just like that was meant to
happen that was meant to be and this is
why so how do you don't see the reason
why until some are so wrong sometimes
you see it straight away
sometimes you don't be very patient and
go to rate it up and you're going to
listen to that intuition you know the
next color is cakey which is like Exxon
coal oh oh oh oh yeah yes yeah play
understand play play in camera which is
like really like like running or
swimming or maybe blaming me like a
behind a bush or behind a tree just make
sure you slam me

on my lips I personally think this is my
color

sides yeah do Nicola think of the last
color is goodbye and it's like a really
pretty moon Rachel OH oh my god Becky
look at her butt not as good as a
sequence of six oh sorry Becky overall
my review on these liquid lipsticks
would be really a nine out of ten I
think they're amazing I love all the
colors they're dry my lips up you can
put as many ways as you want on top of
your lips like over each color you're
actually treating your lips while you
rather like them not try them out like a
liquid lipsticks do especially on the
winter I live - so dry and I don't want
to be putting things all my lips are
going to continue to dry them out I feel
like everyone was filming on that you
know I mean okay girl yeah you delete

more and the Collins lay my ass yeah
