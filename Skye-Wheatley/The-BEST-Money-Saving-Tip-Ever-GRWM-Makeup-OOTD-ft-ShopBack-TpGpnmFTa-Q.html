god literally every time yo hey tries it
John pop a little baby might hurt right
it's like her mom lies you guys tell me
hi guys and welcome back to my channel
it's sky Lewey
we play scat welcome back thanks for
coming back if you're not already make
sure you subscribe hit that like button
cuz it's got a retweet it in tonight's
video I'm going to be showing you this
makeup look showing you how I created it
what products I used all that fun stuff
all that jazz I'm also gonna give you a
quick little look at how styled myself
after I did my makeup
it's kind of an outfit that I would say
girls really well with the makeup
you know I'm clean so Before we jump
into the video I wanted to share this
really amazing site slash app that I
found so basically what this app does is
it helps you save money when spending
money I'm a massive say for myself so
for me I was like oh my god this totally
breakthroughs is like totally
breakthrough technology maybe not
technology
this is like some breakthrough like
this is so epic so I was like okay I
have to share it with my subscribers
because I was really impressed when I
came across this app I was like oh my
god girl mm-hmm why am I not been
showing this earlier or sooner just so
you know I don't spend money like ever
and if I do spend money I'm warning you
I'm warning money back either through
like tax or amazing sites like this so
basically if I buy something it's got to
be tax deductible for me otherwise I
would purchase it that's why I was like
so happy when I found this app because
you can literally earn back money on
everything that they have on this site
they have such iconic brands many
well-known brands you can literally
search anything and you name it it'll be
there anyway
so this app is called shop back
basically all you have to do to earn
cashback is do all your shopping do all
your online shopping through shot back
like I said before they have like heaps
of iconic brands like Priceline a sauce
Woolworths menu lock menu Arctic that's
one yeah ooh boss four are like
literally anything you name it so
basically how it works is they're
awarded commissions from each brand up
on the site and they actually split the
Commission's with their customers which
is like so thoughtful if you ask me like
that is just so lovely they share the
Commission's with their customers so
that's basically how you can get money
back which is amazing this bloody dog
he's moving around like a baby ready to
come out of the womb relax
sorry the more money you spend the more
cash back you'll get example if you were
to book a hotel for like holiday or
something you spent a thousand dollars
you'll earn back $60 cash searching in
the bank girl that's what I'm telling
you every site is different they might
have like 5% cash back 6 percent cash
back for example booking.com
does a 6 percent cash back so if you
thousand dollars you get $60 cash back
so just show you guys what the app looks
like it's this little one here this
little orange up there down the bottom
you can see it up this is what it looks
like you can just scroll through look
it's got explore categories popular
electronics travel food essentials rides
fashion lifestyle sports literally
anything they've got all the brands on
there like Priceline Ubar what else is
on there hello fresh food door ahh so
and they all show you what the
percentage of cashback is so like a base
2% cashback menu look for percent
cashback hello fresh $25 cash back
that's amazing so for me I'm a big
pricing spender so that is so beneficial
to me like it's crazy so for up to 10
percent cashback you guys this is
honestly so crazy and then there's also
I like a little search bar that you can
search for brands
what's the brand I don't know I sauce
let's see what a sauce oh they have 1
teaspoon if you can earn money back when
you're spending money why the not
thoroughly thoroughly seriously it's
been such a good way for me to save
money now I can spend money without the
excusive oh it's got to be tax
deductible anyway I just can't share
that because it was super exciting to me
and hopefully you guys will get some
good use out of it the money seriously
built up over time and it is amazing
like you literally just shop and just
don't even realize how much money you're
getting back also I have a special offer
link below if that gives you $10 sign up
so I'll link that down below in the
description if you guys are interested
definitely check it out and thank me
later
let's get straight into the makeup
tutorial girl well sorry how
boss my black nails I'm literally up
yeah let's get into it let's get into it
so I'm starting with foundation already
on because my skin is that bad and it
will offend some of you I just know that
it will offend people because it deeply
offends me and use a little bit of this
Mac strobe cream I probably used way too
much as you can see I'm pretty strong I
think it just gives you that really
highlighted effect now for concealer I'm
going to go in with where is it oh right
and AHS radiant creamy concealer I
normally wouldn't use such a lot color
actually just gonna mix it days true to
get off my Mac Pro alone can seal up and
Mac one is a little bit darker and I
don't like to go too light you know what
I mean so I'm just going to place that
under my eyes I just got in my eyeball
not a problem my hopes are quickly but
not seriously I'm running out of makeup
I have a real assets and all my makeups
up my mom's house so yeah everyone just
stop and feel sorry for me just joking I
did it to myself but still after losing
your license it's the worst possible
thing in the world
maybe down my nerves as well just cuz
like why not you know my breakouts have
been so intense up anyone has any tips
for me let me know in the comments box
below
because I just can't seem to get it
under control
how's little can she look in a bit what
I'm the girl okay sorrowful powder I'm
going to be using same old same old
new by nature and this is gonna call up
medium matting that down
I think the strobe cream really
emphasizes that Joey look feel like Joey
that you
model look only looks good if you've got
perfect skin sorry by the time this
video is up you guys probably would have
found out that I'm pregnant that's
probably why my skin is pretty bad at
the moment sorry for bronze I'm going to
be using my left minerals I'm really
loving this bronze off I think it's
amazing
hey today's Saturday guys and I'm
literally I kid you not looking for an
outfit all day to wear this dusky event
yeah I don't have anything to wear
but I've known about it for so long
which is the annoying thing like I'm
just not your organized person but I
need to start getting organized because
I'm about to be a mom so it's pretty
scary
I need to get organized I need to start
planning things let's start with eyes

frickin outfit which is just a waste of
my time because it's just not gonna
happen really sure I think they're gonna
wear something that I already have which
is no fun so you got absolutely no one
how could go shopping next week and try
to find something but have no bank card
and I also didn't have a license so that
could be a little difficult
anyway let's stay positive about it with
the colours Dona I'm just going to place
that color in the inner corners of my
the outer corners of my eyes leaving a
little gap in the middle oh okay I need
a smaller brush for this year this is
