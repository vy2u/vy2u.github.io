my god
don't ever do I get out Larry Tooley
you're such a man you know I'm going to
be doing a in-depth Roth tutorial for
you guys today because that's what y'all
requested which is AG sorry I really
have nervously could lay my head down
puree my thought I'd do you eyes and my
brain is going you know what you
white dog let's play let's do this
and then there's like all the cellular
action going on in my brain and I can't
sleep you know when like waffle with to
another and then another thought leads
to another Bowl and then you're like a
completely different page but talk about
that later let's get into the beer so
things you need for your brow sir I've
got a a plum tree by brush pork brow
your power from Australia Beverly Hills
it looks like this stunning iron
barber stop swearing because the new
children on my channel and I don't want
to be a bad influence in influence join
wanna into whether children of the day
desired a just a society alright
actually need to something respond if
we're doing a brass well okay by the way
y'all can feel off the knob a radiant
knob ready
nah not radiant creamy concealer and
this is in the color medium one and then
depending on half cannula I mean that
cream here
I mean I've changed right so going
medium truth you will need a angle brush
I would be using my Mac 208 brush which
I mean clean okay so this is optional a
light switch between the troops I have a
clear brow gel and that format and then
I also have a tinted brow gel which is
strong aqua Laden go that goal that you
let dollar bill in the brown is making
for better really matches we listen you
know man okay we're doing I'm going
again hopefully that's close enough
myself a bit due to difficult a serum
holy crap with will coming out over for
the big strips of rain off Wow
anyway I got all these brushes yesterday
for $80 how good is that there's one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten Russian is a seriously amazing for
$80 their crown brushes
anyone know where to get more brushes
rather cheaper than that them let me
know
anyway so I'm going to start off by
priming my face because I always tell my
face before my brow and I will be using
the whole professional by benefit just
with my whistling brush
so that is Donna typewriters just as I
kallu I brow brush and just brush them
up oh my god I need your lost my honor
valve doctor door bull who carries late
ok for anyone wondering as you my turn I
shall become never let anyone touch am i
doing anything so now that we brush them
off and out rendered pretty much go down
not so straight is going to be sore now
with the Anasazi all browsers in my
mapping rush I'm just going to be going
in with the darker shade I'm just going
to start up the title of the brow just
filling it in following the knocks a
line over your bra obviously
the way home tow back here you want to
stop with the darker shade you're going
to go in with the lighter shade and
filling out the front feels kind of like
that ombre effect like space out and
also when you're late Manila on like on
when you ask the bottom of the brow that
was like a stroke and then what I like
to do is just push the product up into
the head you may need to if you have for
some PR girls like me may need to brush
them down just so you can follow that
top line alright so now is a radical up
just going to take that and going to
place it at the front just using the
same technique grade or pushing the
different up up into the head and you're
doing it really lightly at the front of
the brow once I've done that and how to
just brush the product through the brow
you kind of hardly want any product to
be in front of your brow now this will
transfer like all over your face but
don't worry the carving alkyls brow
fixes all drive through same thing on
the other ground down at the table with
the darker color and just feeling my
eggs so you want to stop about there
that was disaster color and then bring
your water color in through here and you
want your brows to line up so if your
brow is ending here that's not you need
it like stop waxing your brows or
plucking them or going to see your
creamy ballet because it needs to line
up so now you can do this is just like
lime your brush up
we ate the shots of your knife and then
diagonally and then like that
so my brow is perfect let's be honest
sure but it lines up pretty evenly
see so you go one two three so now
taking that image to life and just
pushing the product up into the brow I
mean if I hold on right now I'm just
going to brush the product of this brow
mainly focusing at the front like brush
it out the nurse at the front of the
brow see how they will collect the
ephemeris we're going to we're going to
fix that I'm going to cleaning up I'm
going in with my knob medium to going to
get a little bit and fill on my hand and
then with my enough brush I'm just going
to get that on the mother and start
carving the brow bow I start at the
bottom and just simply draw a line
underneath
and not just instantly give you a nice
shop edge to it
and then we're going to repeat that get
on this Hulk here
I like to go in the middle which is
you'll wear the brown they are mics with
them and then the rest of you can feel
is hooked up on your eyelid and not like
to the base when usually after now I'm
going to do is just get this little
fluffy brush and then just blend the
concealer out so I start in the middle
and then I just push it up and like
blend it really really coarse
so then not bulk throw the sauce then
I'll get the clear gel so I'm going in
with my Mac router and I'm just going to
brush the eyebrow head up and applicants
it's not really a very perfect
that's natural whew I hope you guys
enjoyed this brow tutorial and I hope
that it was helpful let me know in the
comments below if it was and what else
you would like to see anyway I love you
