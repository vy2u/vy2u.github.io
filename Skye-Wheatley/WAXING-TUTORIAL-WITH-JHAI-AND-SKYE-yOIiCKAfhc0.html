so while you are doing is you want to
get your clients pumped up on the bed
make sure you've always got a towel down
in case you spill a little bit of the
wax okay so I've got my wax pot on I put
this on the hottest setting but you
don't want it to be on the hottest
setting while you're doing the actual
waxing don't time cutting that out
this is BG she doesn't know how to do PG
okay my wax nice and hot this is the
consistency right right okay so got me
spatula got me spatula and I yeah that's
not on oh wait it is on so for hot wax
that's for doing eyebrows I want
mustaches so we got a fat on I'm putting
this on the hottest setting just so it
can get hot enough liquify like this one
has and then I'm going to turn it down
because you don't want it at this
consistency because that's far too runny
for hot wax radio okay put your ass away
so I've got me beat cranking with me
beatbox now what is this the people have
been asking I don't know I'll find out
for you guys
a UE boom box right okay so okay and
it's my laptop right so this is a good
condition to drive bootleg copy fuckin
to the side front to the legs and just
apply that down would actually console I
am concentrating my knees downward
oh shit because you want to go ice cream
here with music in place where we feel
me my fucking private leg yeah I'll turn
it off from the second okay so you
always want to go in the opposite
direction that the hair growth is
growing from I'm just going to quickly
show you just this little bit because J
is having a cry and then we'll turn her
private leg wax off but I will be doing
a tutorial on this leg wax okay
sorry you're fucking killing me with
this spatula sorry we always want to do
the knee when the leg is bent otherwise
the wax gets extremely stuck to the
rough skin on the knee where am i oh
that's going to dry before you get the
street night it doesn't dry strip wax
does not dry that is hard wax you are
getting very confused
sorry start from the top put the waxing
paper over the wax make sure you have a
little bit of leverage so you can have a
little bit of a grip here now you want
to rub it fairly hard and make it warm
over the area because that's the way
you're going to get all the hair out ha
ha ha
now just show you
see hair on the wax paper Wow okay
so you just want to continue to do that
huh all I was like oh my gosh eyes so
pristine is that yeah look how much
you're hairy I am just letting you all
know I am the best wax wax r /p
therapist on the Gold Coast there's no
one better and that's why I cannot have
my legs waxed by other people because it
frustrates me that they don't know what
they're doing Oh now if you guys want to
see a proper tutorial on me doing a leg
wax or lip wax or whatever let me know
and I'll do a proper video this is just
a bit of play around sorry after you
finished waxing you have to put oil and
most friggin beauty therapist don't do
this and it does my head in
you have to put oil tree remove any
excess wax that's left on the skin sorry
this is result hairless legs nor hair
whatsoever because I'm a boss like I'm
literally the best
so dry ask me it's a down guy asked me
to wax her mustache but I kindly told
her that the hot wax was too hot
see this runny consistency that is far
too hot it needs to be can you come here
dry and hold this place or what hold the
camera yeah it needs to be this about
this thickness see this big ball it's
kind of still soft so it needs to kind
of be that thickness so it's like that
see thicker anyway you get the G splat
and normally you're supposed to do this
with a cotton bud but I just did it with
a spatula because I'm friggin over
waxing her sit down hold the camera for
me here I'll do this so you can see is
it on you oh my god oh my fucking man Oh
your breath okay so I'm ripping it the
opposite direction of what the hairs are
growing oh my god hurts okay then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
