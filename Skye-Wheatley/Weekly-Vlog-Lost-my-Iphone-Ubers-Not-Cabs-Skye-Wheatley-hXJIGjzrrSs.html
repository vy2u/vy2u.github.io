but yellow they go up there I got yard
Erica and this is the aftermath
King dad come over I'm so bored young
king why face mask time get those tokens
out of my face I left my phone in a
 cab last night the person who
works at lot of property was sick today
so I had to wait a whole nother today to
know if I'm getting my phone back or not
and it's very V of the stressful be
stressful axles Instagram still hacked
so that's making you stressed and then
the net like the negative energy is just
flop in here at the moment is very
stressful
everyone pray for me that I get my phone
back because if I don't I'm going to
jump off the nearest cliff like by in
bed in my favor and see you guys in bed
with the famous friends famous friend
irrelevant bitch
hallelujah so I have to bring my own
pillow because Michaels are that
uncomfortable but yeah firstly I'm so
happy because today well last night I
got my song by oh oh yeah D so I was
actually when do I speak to you guys I
think was when I had a face mask on was
that Monday night or some yeah sure
Monday night
are you yeah
don't bug on me
yeah very mundane I was reading you guys
lost to me and I had lost my fart I'd
left it in the back of the cab I'm not
feeling this hair up vibes
because it's a egghead bun
anyway is fine yes sir Monday night have
not changed out of this shirt for like
three days fine because my personal
hygiene is on point can't can't can't
can't yes sir Monday was the last time
that you guys saw me and I was really
really depressed because like retreat if
I can give you any advice it's don't
ever get into a car only you through biz
because if you leave something in the
back of the cab
you have guaranteed depression for at
least two or three days or however long
it takes them to find lost property in a
car like seriously it took three days to
find my phone and I'm so so sorry
 grateful that they did and I
come to the quipment
I've come to the conclusion that I am
not drinking anymore because whenever I
drink I get anxiety the next day I'm
obviously hungover and I get depression
I and going server from now on if I do
drink I'm really going to have like one
or two or three I don't know all that
okay literally my heart is what shall I
filled with so much gratitude right now
like those past three days of not
knowing whether or not I was going to
get my throne back was actually hell
like I'm pretty sure I was burning in
the pits of hell okay that's a stressful
but pulse for us for that situation all
this is my life this is my world this is
my baby
I'm just so so thankful and grateful
that that is still amazing people left
in the world that are honest
that lack returning people today
I'm just feeling so so grateful to be
alive to have all my limbs to be
breathing I'm going to go exchange these
shoes that I got because as per usual I
got the wrong size salt look how amazing
these are girlfriend I'm going to go get
the right size in those so that my
bunions don't swell upon my feet because
that's what happens if you wear shoes
not a true small view you get bunions
not a problem
also I called up the doctors to book in
some counseling sessions because I
literally have that much anxiety and I'm
over it and really over at like
I just have a million in one thoughts
going through my mind and it's just like
sending me mental I'm not sure it's
depression or if I'm just like
overthinking things constantly I think
part of the reason why is because I
drink too much I going to go out I just
get I'm not go that gets re
loose that I can't even stand like it's
embarrassing I need to stop I'm 23 I
need to get my together
so yeah I'm going to the doctor's this
afternoon to get some help okay I need
help i need help and I'm not scared to
admit that because it's true anyway I'll
see you guys soon
mwah be grateful for today be grateful
for who you are and be grateful for
absolutely everything for more things
that you wish for to come into your life
that is the secret okay I love you guys
my humanistic nonsense aside
okay I legit have anger management
there's something wrong with me this
makes me so angry like why why I
don't understand so I didn't end up
getting the bigger side I'm just going
to take the soul out of these and go get
a sinner soul I'm going to need to have
surgery on my feet like I need to get my
bunions removed and I need to get my
foot like shaved on the sides because I
don't fit into any shoes and it annoys
me ah good morning lovely people so
tonight is Thursday and I'm going to go
catch up with my friend Tori she's
pregnant at the moment we're going to
blend laughs and then I've got to go
back to my car because I was up all
night last night with the worst anxiety
over the bunions on my feet I have
tailored bunions which are like the
bunions on your pinky toe and it's from
wearing shoes that are too small for you
and think it was because in primary
school I hated the look of big shoes on
my feet I just liked the look of smaller
shoes on my feet so I would force my
feet into shoes that were too small and
now I have big ugly bunions on my
toes so I'm taking these back because
I've decided that they're too small I
don't want my bunions to get any worse
anyway I'm off to breakfast now so come
on with me girlfriend
mmm that's a really good puck that's a
really good puck hi yummy mummy hi Noah
hi Noah
go son honored but you're on candid
camera look okay no I am cupcakes
yes oh my god love it oh no no no no no
can you see he's at you we're going to
see God so guys we are going to
interview Tori good afternoon everyone
so I sorted this true situation out I
went in there and I was like I am back
if I worked in a shop and I had a
customer like myself I would literally
be like off
get out of my shop because that's how
painful I am to deal with
I'm just really fluffy and if
something's not right
I'm not afraid to like let everyone more
and like I'm not afraid to complain like
if I went out to do not and had a bad
meal I'll go up to them and famine or
painters because that's just how my mom
brought us up I mean if you don't get
what you pay for then don't pay for it
you know what I mean that's my mother
anyway I am about to go and have coffee
with Tia and we are going to organize
these Bali trip that we've been talking
about four-star long can't and then I
probably just going to have a shower do
all my emails and go to bed because I'm
so tired and he has well asleep I
thought because I would really have so
much anxiety like I can't even explain
how much anxiety I have about everything
like last night it was about the bunions
on my toes I just things just get to me
stupid just gets me and like hi I'm
a natural binary and yes I guess I can't
yeah little things just blur my mind off
and then I overthink things and then I
get you know kept awake by my turn brain
and I don't know anymore I just need to
like relax and I've been really
tense
like uneasy lately anyway this isn't
like searching stars Diaries is it this
is the blocks I have to find out
