it's Scott Murray weird the whole sky
lobby with the hey in today's beer oh my
god my arm is dying it's it's dead it's
officially dead but anyway in in in in
in today's video I wanted to share with
you guys what I like to eat in a day so
that's what I'm gonna show you this
morning I got up and drove tripe here oh
my god are you right I got up and I
drove to my Pierre box and on the way I
stopped and got a chai tea so I got a
chai tea bag with almond milk hot water
three sachets of honey and cinnamon on
top I think it's better than getting
like a chai latte because of all the
artificial sugars and whatever that's in
it so yeah I just prefer to get honey
instead of a chai latte when I'm being
healthy if I'm not then I'll get a chai
latte cuz God they are so good oh I
would get a coffee with almond milk I
don't really drink a lot of Dairy Dairy
Milk I don't really drink a lot of cows
I like almond milk oh damn girl I did
arms yesterday and holding these camera
is a struggle I will show you what I
have for breakfast lunch do not end
snacks if you guys enjoy these types of
videos please make sure you give it a
thumbs up so I can do more for you ulcer
just quickly these lashes that I have on
sorry I have a few really exciting
things that I've been working on and one
of them is my iron lash line so I got
samples from this other place and I
wasn't happy with them so I contacted
this other lady and she sent me out a
few samples and these are one of the
samples they are very dramatic
especially because I'm like really not
used to having fake lashes on anymore I
did have the
extensions then I got them taken out and
I've just been like growing right
natural ones back so I usually just put
mascara on now so I'm just like whoa
trying to get used today's a little bit
but other than that I think that
absolutely stunning I would wear these
anywhere really I just absolutely love
them there are clear band so you can
kind of see that which is annoying but I
can you just put like eyeliners at the
top but why I wanted a clear band is
because that's so much easier to apply
anyway I will show you in another video
the samples that I got but yet I just
wanted to quickly touch on that also let
me know in the comments if you do like
these lashes if you would wear them if
you wouldn't if they're true dramatic
also like leave your feedback on what
type of lashes you do like to wear cuz
that would really help me let's get on
with the day what I eat hope you enjoy
this video I love you guys and I'll see
you in my next video
I won't know I went wrong today why do I
feel like a Linda Lingle between the
words to say to say though I remember
now control hey guys just ignore the
crazy makeup throughout the day unlike
in between filming videos and stuff but
I'm getting a little bit peckish now so
I'm going to have a handful of almonds
and also I forgot to tell you guys to
always stay hydrated I drink about four
they're like for four to five cups of
water like this each day to be healthy
you need to start by upping your water
intake so I've just got a handful of
almonds you don't need many has very
high in calories oh okay sorry what I'm
gonna do I don't blame my food and I
don't count my calories but I will let
you know how many calories are in each
meal I'm eating some maybe about a
hundred reps of blueberries this banana
top of the normal
turning that
it got a handful and then I'm going to
talk that out we water and just do one
scoop of this woman's best protein Oh
add a teaspoon of the flaxseed helps you
go to the toilet so like yeah who
doesn't want to go to the toilet about
that much and ulcer tucked up my work
I'm gonna teach and enjoy this that
yummy
okay so I'm steaming the broccoli I'm
not gonna cook the rashes yet I'm gonna
cook these salmon and I'm just going to
use a little bit of wise lentil for
everything coconut oil on the Panda and
then I'm just gonna drizzle this salmon
with some lemon okay I start breaking
this Simon up into little pieces
cuz it's going in everything is going in
together at the end anyway
I'm gonna put the peas in the broccoli
hey guys I'm just cooking the onion and
the garlic cooked that really really
well and then put this in okay sir
apparently you have to put coconut milk
in with the coma so I put like half of
this in there and that's the end results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
