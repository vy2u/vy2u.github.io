just have to double check anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and let's
get straight into it okay so the first
thing that I got is just cute a little
checkered dress I absolutely love it it
comes around ties at the front I love
that it has sleeves because some days I
feel really self-conscious about my arms
and maybe the st. end coming off around
my armpits or anything like that so I
love dresses with sleeves it's super
comfortable zips up all the way at the
back and yeah just a really cute basic
to have really to the next dress that I
picked up is this a cute little floral
red dress if this is in a size 8 and so
was the last hour I just tried on your
wraps around at the front here and then
it just sits up at the back very fun
very bright very playful and you all
know how I feel about my frills okay so
another really cute basic that I got
it's just really cute grey grey dress it
feels like true what do you call this I
don't know pieces of ivory that tie ups
you can make it as tight or as loose as
you want which is absolutely perfect
super super comfortable material again
it has sleeves so easy to dress up or
down I also got this pink jumper from
them
I've won this in a few of my videos and
my photos and everyone's been asking
where I've got it so hot box is where I
got it this has seriously been my
biggest obsession this winter cause it's
so comfy so warm and it literally goes
with anything so yeah and of course this
hat is from there as well another to
rest I picked up is this really cute
number of by the way all the sizes are
in size eight or small this is like the
linen fabrics got the cute little frills
down the bottom it's gathered here on
the sleeves and then it just ties up
here and again has their sleeve start is
really really fluttering on your body
socks are in super tight at the waist
accentuate your boobies in your butt and
it's comfortable at the same time okay I
picked up a pair of mom jeans these are
in size 10 I just have them rolled down
the bottom I don't know if you see that
can you see that and then I picked up
this really cute crop top really cute
frills on the sleeves I feel like that's
so flattering it makes your arms look
skinnier and then it tires here into a
cute little boy it's super comfortable
it's a linen fabric and that's top that
I picked up is this really cute crop
white top it's like that ribbed fabric
and I've got this constant sleeves are
so unique and I just thought it was so
cute and it's very different and conquer
wrong with what hey this is gonna be my
fave out fit of all of them just because
it's sorry I'm a doggy
damn you hot Chuck it's dougie and it's
super comfortable and it's just sort of
easy to throw on and go no I'm saying
it's got a few holes in it
very vintage super beautiful soft fabric
which is what I want and I love and I
live for in life I just feel like the
biggest badass boss mummering this well

so this is my second last outfit I got
two of these one in black one in this
really cute baby blue stretchy fabric

I love to wear these as dresses and the
good thing about these is you can dress
them up or dress them down if I was
going to dress this up I would wear like
