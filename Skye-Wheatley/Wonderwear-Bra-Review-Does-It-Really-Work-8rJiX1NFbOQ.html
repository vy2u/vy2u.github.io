it's sky no ryu in a god MOBA you in
today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you guys the only bra that I ever
wear I've been getting a lot of
questions about this bra I posted a
couple times on my Instagram and you
know people just basically want to know
if it actually works what it does for
them if it can hold really big breasts
oh so I'm just gonna run you through my
only draw product I don't wear bras I
hate bras are uncomfortable they're
annoying they cut into you even though
I'm not I'm not a big girl tight bras or
any bras just kind of make you look ball
G in my opinion because at the back
you're that kind of hangs over and it
can make you look a little bit chubby or
like you're holding extra weight so
that's why I wanted to share with you
guys this bra that I've been loving
lately it's the only raw that I do use
and it is the Wonder Bra I'm sure you
guys have seen this bra all over
Instagram I'm wearing it right now I bet
you didn't even know anyway offering the
bra this little looks like heaps of
people have been posting this bra
including me when they first contacted
me I'm pretty sure they were using a
different type of bra and I don't know I
didn't really like it and it didn't
really work for me as well so I kind of
like told them and said you know I don't
really it's not my thing
bra and this is when they were quite new
so they went back to the manufacturer
and sourced a different bra or they made
changes to it and then they sent it to
me and I tried it and I just fell in
love with it it actually taped all my
boxes sorry
that's pretty cool actually helped
create this bra would you say I
I'm just like really fussy when it comes
to bras but the beauty in this bra is
you can actually adjust if the front
according to how much or how little
cleavage you want so basically how you
use it is you just stick it on like this
probably take the plastic off when you
do take the plastic off you keep this I
like to put the plastic back over in my
bras just so it's not collecting dust
and getting dirty when it takes sitting
in my cupboard you know what I'm saying
you take this sticky stuff off and it
has this sticky side to it which sticks
to your skin just like those sticky bras
that you get from cotton or whatever and
I like to stick it on while this is down
the bottom like that so this is pulled
out completely stick it on and then you
can adjust it by pulling it in and then
as the bra pulls itself in it creates
some beautiful cleavage it's backless
it's so easy to use and it's really
affordable so you can wear this with
like backless dresses or things that you
literally can't wear a bra with that's
what I find is so good with this bra is
that you can literally wear it with
anything and most bras you cannot it
also gives you that extra cleavage cuz
my boobs I don't know but I'm not
wearing a bra they just don't have
cleavage they're kind of this side to
side for bigger girls or have bigger
breasts yes this would work for you it's
really quite sticky it does hold your
press up I have noticed if you're super
sweaty then it doesn't stick as well you
just make sure like when you're putting
this on that your body temperature is
quite cool that's when it's gonna stick
the best on your skin this bra can be
used up to 50 times I just wash my bra
with warm soapy water and then I just
let it air dry and like I said before I
keep these plastic covers and just stick
them back or I bust out the brothels and
collect dust or done it's literally
brand new after you wash it and I will
show you guys a little demo of how to
use it and what it look
at the end of this video you can see
that it does give me cleavage and I'm
about a I'm a decomp but I get the seed
cup for all size
maybe I ever see coffee maybe I'm like a
seedy cop this is what the C cup looks
like and it fits my boobs perfectly so
if y'all the same breast sizes me then
yeah I'd probably recommend going for
the C and you want it to be a little bit
smaller anyway because then you're not
seeing any of it when you weld little
panty tops like this one anyway I'll
