my hair is natural a ponytail I kind of
trick like twist it so it doesn't look
completely disgusting and I'm outside I
don't know if it's windy and I'm barely
wearing any makeup but I still want to
do a video for you guys so I'm going to
be doing the ten little secrets tag and
I got requests to do this by a few
people so I decided I would do this and
yeah I'm gonna get right into it
so the first question is what is one
product that makes you feel like a
million dollars and that is easy for me
that is mascara that's all I'm wearing
right now it just like it makes me feel
ten times better like I can easily go
out anywhere in just mascara but like
when I'm not with mascara I like don't
even look at myself so yeah I'm just
wearing mascara now I'm I feel so much
better in mascara so that's definitely
my answer for that one
number two is one is my skincare secret
um I was thinking about this and I
didn't think I had one and then I came
up with one and I don't know this is bad
for your skin
okay so I'm gonna tell you guys this and
if it's bad for you I'm so sorry it just
like work to me so basically if you're
is it you take a little rubbing alcohol
I'm like a q-tip and you put it on the
zit and mine disappears and like a night
and I don't know if that's bad their
skin but it shrivels them up and they're
like gone so I definitely recommend that
I think if it's not bad through the skin
to get rid of your sets because that
works like perfectly for me so that's my
skincare secret I guess okay number
three is to share my haircare secrets
and basically that is to use like nice
nourishing products after you shower so
I have two here to show you um this is
the Aussie hair insurance leave-in
conditioner and basically I just spray
this all over my hair after I shower and
I feel like this makes my hair a lot
softer and it kind of just me
you're a lot healthier and I feel like
this helps my hair a lot okay and the
next product is my renewing Moroccan oil
from organics and you can get this you
can get both of these at drugstore and
that's just once again it helps my hair
I put both of these in usually just so I
get like extra hair help but yeah so I
definitely recommend getting a product
to put in your hair after you shower
because they do like tons of help for my
hair and they probably would for you too
okay number four is what is my biggest
diet rule that's kind of a joke because
I do not diet at all and that might come
as a surprise to meet some of you guys
but honestly I am like the worst eater I
eat a bunch of crap I eat a lot of stuff
and I don't know so that's probably not
the best question for me but I mean I
guess for those of you that do try to
eat well just eat in moderation I mean
you can have the nice things that you
like like candy and stuff just don't eat
them a ton and try not to eat like the
ton of things at a time and if you're
buggin eat chips or something put a
little bit in like a little container
and just eat those so you're not just
like digging through the bag or whatever
and then you don't have to go back to
get more I guess that's all I can say
umm yeah I don't really have any tips
for that okay number five is any workout
tips no I wouldn't track so I think
that's kind of a tip in itself is to
join a sport because they're fun you
meet new friends and you definitely get
like worked out and stuff so joy sport
is one of that if you don't want to join
a sport just like set goals for yourself
so you know maybe stay consistent and
like if you want to go running so make
sure you go on the same amount of time
like every weekend or every day or
whatever and you don't want to like slap
just make sure you're consistent but my
definite tip
is to join a sport because that's always
fun and you're definitely like working
out when you're doing that okay so
number six I believe is what perfume is
your secret weapon and I don't really
have a secret weapon perfume like I like
perfume but I always forget to put it on
and I'm always like forgetting to wear
it but my favorite perfume that I have
is my DKNY be Delicious I don't have
with me because once again I'm in
Florida and I'm on my little balcony
right now but I really like that smell
it smells really fresh it's not too like
annoying and like sugar you know that
stuff which I like but I mean some
people don't so yeah my DKNY be
Delicious okay show us a clothing item
of yours that always turns heads now
this is kind of hard for me especially
because I don't have all my clothes here
in Florida but I haven't even good shirt
that I think kind of turns heads kind of
interesting so I will show you that now
so basically it's a skull tank top and
you might have seen it before in a video
of mine but it's just really colorful I
believe it's like the Mexican sugar
skull and it's really cool and I mean
I'm not like all into skulls but I mean
I like them I'm actually wearing a
bracelet with skulls on it right now
this would be in a haul video but um I
really like skulls I'm not like all into
them but I like this show a lot as well
and everyone I was already looking at it
because it's really intricate and stuff
so yeah I was from H&amp;amp;M a while ago and I
loved it so I guess that kind of turns
heads okay number eight is what your
most treasured piece of jewelry and this
was kind of hard for me but I decided to
pick my pearls just because my dad gave
these to me and I wear them every single
day so uh yeah I mean I do have a lot of
rings that I really like but I feel like
my pearls are probably my most treasured
piece treasured piece um because I wear
them all the time
and so I keep touching my hair like if I
didn't twist it like this it would just
be like a nasty disgusting taste but um
yeah so my pearls
is probably the answer for this one okay
number nine who is your style crush and
I'm gonna combine like two people here
because I don't know I'm just going to
so first of all it would be worn
I love her style it's really girly which
is like one side of my style I like
girly things kind of as you can tell
from this top it's just roughly and
really pretty solo in Connor behalf of
it but I'm also kind of edgy sometimes
so Lucy Hale style from Pretty Little
Liars she's aria I kind of want to mix
her in with Lauren Conrad because oh
yeah has a really edgy style which I
like but Lauren has like a girly style
and I kinda like to combine the two so
that's gonna be my style crush like
combined okay and the final question is
tell us something we don't know about
you and I didn't really know what to
choose for this one but I decided to
choose something kind of boring it's
actually that I get really good grades
and school is really important to me and
it's kind of random and like boring but
yeah I have a 99 overall average I know
which is kind of crazy especially for me
but school is really important to me and
I think like everyone should make school
a priority because if you don't do well
in school you know like you're not gonna
be able to get a really good job and I
know me not everyone but like school is
really important to me and I think
people might not know that but yeah a
lot of the times I'm like studying and
stuff so that's the other reason why I
don't make videos all the time because I
get back on track and then I dunno I
don't work and stuff so yeah I guess I
wanted to be that I get pretty good
grades I know that's kind of stupid and
boring but whatever I don't think you
really expect that because some people
look at me and I'm like really stupid
but I'm not so yeah I think I'm gonna
show you guys the view outside of my
hotel room I have kind of a like a whe
room or like a complex next to me but my
hotel is actually really nice it's a
school but I'm going to show you the
ocean view right now so yeah there is
the ocean it's really pretty and then
there's the parking lot he so yeah
there's a nice building a person running
oh yeah I hope you guys at this tag
video I tagged all of you to do this and
I hope it was kind of fun or whatever
about um yes so bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
