you're new my name is Tasha welcome so
today I have another college video no
worries it's not a haul video I know
some people were getting pretty salty
then I do a lot of haul videos so this
is not a haul video so basically I came
across a bunch of articles and things
online talking about the things people
don't tell you about college or what you
don't know about college going into it
and I thought that would be a cool video
idea I bet people have done this before
but this is going to be my take on
things because I do a lot of college
videos and you guys seem to like my fave
and things so I just look at some of the
Articles and if I did follow any of
their ideas I will be linking them down
below if you guys want to see their
other ideas and there are other pieces
of advice and those articles totally
check them out so I did take some broad
topics from some these articles and then
some of these I did come up with
completely on my own so I just want to
give those articles credit to obviously
like I say in all my college videos I
know that some of you guys won't agree
with these things or you'll think these
are obvious things that everyone knows
about College if that's the case I'm
sorry I know this isn't going to be
exactly correct for every single person
that watched this video but you know
just just keep that in mind and like I
say in all my videos if you guys are not
following me on Instagram and my other
social media portals portal but is such
a weird phrase I think I made this a
platform but if you're not following me
on those and you want to I will put my
Instagram on the screen that is why I'm
most active by also with Twitter and
snapchat so I will be putting those in
the description box of this video okay
and one more thing I know I'm sorry this
intro is so long people always ask the
shirt I'm wearing is from Zara and your
necklaces are from Etsy sellers I will
try and link all this stuff in the
description box if you guys want to twin
with me okay so the first thing people
may not tell you about college is that
you may struggle to make friends and
this is kind of a broad thing but
basically I feel like you know people
definitely glorify their college
experiences you know you see all your
friends go through
with all the new college friends it
looks like they're having so much fun
but in reality just know that not
everyone is making tons of friends you
know they might post an Instagram with
someone they have like one classroom you
know what I mean like it's not all
butterflies and rainbows
I actually was lucky to make friends
fairly quickly my freshman year but
going on to the next portion of this
little tip your friendships are going to
change I know in high school at least
for me or not even to high school like
all throughout my schooling years up
until college if you were friends with
someone for a really long time you felt
bad breaking off a friendship it would
be like oh my gosh I've been friends
with them my entire life I can't not be
friend to them you know what I mean but
that's just not how it is in college I
can tell you my personal experience I'm
not friends with all the people that I
was really close with freshman year and
that may just be because I transfer
colleges I'm sure you know that has
something to do with it but my friend
groups have switched a lot and you know
it's not that you like hate those people
it's just you're growing so much to the
person and so are they that you kind of
just move around and discover the people
that you really want to surround
yourself with so don't be afraid if you
don't meet like your best friends ever
immediately in college it takes a lot of
time to adjust
and kind of meet new people and feel
yourself out and figure out where you
fit oh wait a second think people won't
tell you about college is that you
should forget about a long time these
things that mainly pertain to your
freshman year but if you're living in a
dorm style situation with a roommate
home girls home boys forget about alone
time so I'm not only child and I grew up
with my own room and everything so I
really really values my own social space
and having time alone and whatever that
do you guys see that there's literally
planes going out anyway so I really
value having my own personal space and
my roommate was the same way I know she
was know a child as well we gave each
other the personal space but honestly
you're gonna be stranded by people all
the time whether you're in class you're
in your room your room your leader
you're trying to shower you have like
communal bathrooms are going to be
people around sometimes it's really hard
to get that personal space a long time
that you want so you kind of have to
make effort to get past
number three is that your roommate may
not be your BFF your best friend forever
your do everything read all the time I
know going into college that's kind of
what a lot of people plan either they
know who the roommates going to be or
they pick them online and you're like
stalking them and everything and you're
like oh my gosh this person is me we're
going to be the best friends ever and
that may be the case but I have seen
with so many people that they get in
there and they love their roommate at
first and their best friends made you
everything together and then slowly to
start like distancing yourself you
become less close you may argue about
things and ultimately you may not be
best friends with them and that's
something that you need to accept like I
said some people do stay best friends
with a roommate and they're literally
best friends forever but just keep in
mind that this may not be the case for
you and if you guys are best friends
it's not the end of the world okay the
fourth thing is about grades and it is
about failing
Haley's for me and the schools that I
ever tended a lot of people are used to
having straight A's in high school not
really having to study or really work
hard to get those grades and I call it
that's really not the case I haven't
failed anything but I definitely had to
work harder to get better great on your
first exam a lot of the times you will
literally get like a P if you're a
straight-a student you know what C or D
or an app and you'll be like oh my gosh
like what is going on this is scary but
just not it's normal and it's going to
happen you need to adjust and kind of
see how the professor wants their work
to be done and just see how you get
study so you may not get the best grades
in the world at first but just need to
adjust to schoolwork and the workload
and figure out how to manage your time
so don't freak out about that okay so
number 5
maybe it isn't just the people that I've
been around but you know how people say
that in college the drama is over I
don't really think that's the case I do
see that in high school obviously it's a
lot easier to be clicky because you're
all in the same building all day every
day but I don't ending columns there
definitely still are like group you know
people still do talk there's drama
I do encounter that so just don't think
that you're going to get away from that
completely probably not going to happen
and if that is the case seriously you're
so lucky okay so number six is that you
don't need to know exactly what you want
to do when you're going into college I
know how people do say this but I have
my own personal experience with this so
this doesn't have to do with my major I
am a communication major which I do love
and it's perfect for me but I always
thought I was super into film and Soma
you know through YouTube I was like oh
yeah I love video they love anything
like I think it's so cool so I took
introduction to cinema this previous
semester I wouldn't say I hated it but I
definitely didn't like it and it was
just really interesting to me to like
try out classes that I thought I was
like and then find out that I don't like
them so going off of that college is
really about trial and error if you
don't know what you want to do just hire
a bunch of things because you may be
surprised with what you like and what
you don't like even if you do going to
college saying yes I want to be a
biology major I love biology and UK
biology and you're like oh my gosh I
don't like this this isn't for me don't
worry that's normal and that's totally
fine just don't be afraid to try out a
bunch of options because that's what
your first few years in college are for
okay number seven is twigs will spread I
remember I have strep throat and that I
was better for like a week and then I
would get a call and I'd be better for
like two weeks and then I get a stuffy
nose not any better for a little bit and
I'd be sick again and it was just a
cycle and I don't here at USC norovirus
spread like first semester throughout
the freshman dorms and everyone had in
everyone was sick and everyone was like
pumping and sanitizer and like trying to
stay away from everyone who was sick
like it was seriously a plague so make
sure you're watching your hands trying
to be healthy take your vitamin C you
know drink a lot of water
do what you can because everyone gets
sick and when one person gets sick the
next person gets sick and it spreads
everywhere so just be aware make sure
try to be sanitary and all that stuff
okay number eight is actually the
opposite of something I saw on an art
I am saying that textbooks are not
always necessary for classes even if
they're listed now to knee out I'm not
gonna lie to you guys I'm going to be
totally real for you guys
there have been classes where I bought
the textbooks and not looked at them
once and got on an A in the class and I
that was not with Keating or anything I
never did the reading and I still got
eight so I'm not saying this is going to
be the case for everyone but I would say
to go into the class without buying the
book at first and if you feel like you
are going to need the book
you know if you look at the assignment
or you kind of figure out the material
and see if you think you're going to
need the book do that before you buy the
book because books are so expensive they
can be like $300 I paid like $250 for a
book and then never looked at it so ok
number 9 is 8 a.m. classes are painful I
remember in high school I woke up every
day at like 5:50 a.m. or like 6 a.m.
with the latest to get ready for school
so I was like oh I can have like 3 a
times a week that's nothing oh that's
what you think ladies and gents but that
is not the case I don't know what
happens in college but for some reason
which not at like 7:00 a.m. feels like
you're waking up at 4 a.m. I don't know
what it is my first semester of my
freshman year I took 8 a.m. classes
Monday Wednesday Friday it was very
difficult to go last of my classmates
skipped and I don't some people are
complete morning people morning person
so they will disagree with this but this
is just a warning the aliens might not
seem to warble let's say our I mean test
it out I don't haven't been testing it
out of the Friday's that was my best
call but yeah you can try it and get
back to me on that okay number 10 oh my
gosh it's already at the last one okay I
wanted to end off on a happy fluffy note
so my last thing is to enjoy college
don't think it too seriously obviously
take it seriously it's a lot of money
it's very important but have fun College
is like the last time in your life where
you can
two irresponsible things and somehow get
away with it
obviously not all your responsible
things come on guys but you know what I
mean you're still kind of a kid you're
still trying to figure thing about after
college is the real world you have to
get a real person job and that's
literally terrifying don't be afraid to
go out of the Monday just sick you know
have fun live your life you're not
you're going to be old and crusty some
day anyways I think though it's going to
be ten things I wanted to put in this

things or give constructive feedback on
these things totally feel free to do so
