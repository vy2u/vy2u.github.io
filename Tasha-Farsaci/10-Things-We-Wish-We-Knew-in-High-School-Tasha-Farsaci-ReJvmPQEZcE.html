Gretchen and Lucy out with their channel
channels they have like a vlog channel
together and I Gretchen has her own
channel but I'll link them down below
I'm staying with them for like a few
days and it's really exciting and we
wanted to film a video together so I
asked you guys a while back on Instagram
to like leave comments for like requests
for us to do and a lot of people who
wanted to know like high school kind of
videos cuz I forget that a lot of you
guys are probably still in high school
are like not even in high school yet and
not in college so some people were
requesting like the things that we wish
we knew in high school so that's what
we're gonna do we're gonna do the 10
things that we wish you knew in high
school and we kind of like all came up
with these together and I'm just gonna
like a read through that but I don't
like all talked about them and I thought
this would be like really helpful and
yeah okay so the first thing I made look
a little list on my phone is that your
GPA starts counting like your first day
of freshman year you guys more like
talked about yeah I feel like this one I
was like has to go in here because like
for me at least for me at least like I
just remember when I started like high
school as my college I remember running
through the night school that like I
just didn't know that like since the
first day of 9th grade like that counts
all through like senior year that's what
the GPA that colleges are gonna see so
like try freshman year I get out it
seems like all just really far away but
like it's still really important yeah I
know some people to that like their GPAs
were so good like junior year but then
they're like oh shoot my freshman year
GPA they totally bought it up and down
so just like try your hardest like all
through high school because it does
count and you
okay so number two that we have is that
your friends will change from year to
year and I think this one's like really
important so if you like have a friend
like freshman year and you guys are kind
of drifting like don't freak out because
your friends seriously like change every
year and it's like its natural for that
to happen you know like don't get too
caught up over okay number three is like
don't dwell on high school relationships
like slash breakups so like if you break
up with like your boyfriend or
girlfriend it's not the end of the world
if you're gonna be new people especially
even in high school or like after high
school in college there's so many more
people in the world so it's like
literally not the end of the world and I
do know some people like Gretchen quartz
still would like through high school
relationships so I'm not saying that
they're like die important and like
they're not gonna last but I'm saying
that if you are having like relationship
problems
it's nothing in the world because you'll
seriously meet so many people and like
you might not even talked about after
high school so yeah okay
so the fourth one we have is don't worry
about what people think too much this is
like this has to go in you because for
me I know in high school like it seemed
like it was such an important part of my
life and I was like like I just cared so
much but everyone thought of me like I
would get not that it's not good to like
get really ready for school and lucky
your best cuz like that's great and all
but I would spend way too much time
getting ready in the morning and I cared
what everyone thought of me like I just
wanted everyone to like me you know I
heard that no like someone didn't like
me out try really hard to get them to
like me I'm like don't worry about it
like don't stress about it that much and
I was telling Tasha yesterday like I
remember like trip in the hallway and
I'd be like I'd call my parents and ugh
I have to come home like I can't like
live like how can I move on like tiny
little things would happen and like you
get so caught up in them and you worry
that like everyone will remember you
that way like hey she's the girl that
tripped in the hall lighter like slipped
in class
literally don't worry about look
everything seems like such a big deal in
high school but like you're gonna go to
college and no one's gonna remember
anything that happened in high school
like you're like your worst critic like
I remember things that happen and like
you're getting mad at yourself for
things that no one else cares about so I
feel like if you do something
embarrassing as long as you own it like
yeah I think you're funny am i cool yeah
I think like you think people care more
than they do
no I remember I'm straight my hair for
like an hour every single morning I rush
my sophomore year it was ridiculous and
then I just like I was like wait why am
i doing this and then I like having
sense yeah okay so number five is don't
be afraid to change your interests and
when I say that I mean if you're in
styling a sport and you don't really
like it and you really want to try I
don't know like theatre or something
don't be afraid to change just because
that's what you've been doing your whole
life I think high school is a great time
to change and like find out who you are
and what you like and I know I was doing
sports in like the beginning of high
school and I realized that I just wasn't
really that well did it for me and I
switched and I started like focusing on
YouTube and just stuff like that I'm
like clubs so I mean I know like I
changed and I'm like really glad that I
did and I think some people are afraid
because I don't know maybe their parents
will be mad at that or their friends
will all look like their sports team but
I think you know it's like important to
like be yourself and like do what makes
you happy because yeah otherwise high
school is just gonna be like really
stressful yeah I didn't this you're
going into college do you think you're
like talking to me
number six is don't kill yourself with
the school work did you guys have a
story or what oh no that was really Iran
I feel like that happens with both of
you a lot and like me too like Lucy
especially I think you would try so hard
and like it's really yeah it's like yeah
I know so many people that took like
tons of AP classes and I took a lot of
AP classes and then I haven't still
didn't get into like my top choice
school and I know this happened to so
many people like you took like all of my
classes and really killing yourself and
then you you still it didn't really do
much so I mean I think it's important to
take the ones that you really want to
take don't like slack off but and do
well on the ones that you are taking
because you take a ton it's really hard
to do like all of them but yeah honestly
I think everyone thinks come I just take
all the AP classes all the others good
and it's like okay well I did that I
know someone that didn't even more than
I did and neither of us got until I got
to high school so it's kind of like you
know just to do the best that you can do
and that's what's like important yeah I
feel like too like you know when you're
challenging yourself so if you know when
it's too much so like if you're enrolled
in like a for AP classes and you're like
like I'm literally dying like don't do
it just because you're like I have to
get to a certain college like say you've
gotten to that College killing yourself
in high school like do you think you're
gonna be like successful in college
knowing yourself again like you know
what I mean like just think like where
you fit in best and think like I need to
challenge myself
but I also don't want to be like killing
myself and on the other and you also
don't want to like be taking it too easy
like charge yourself a little bit like
not too much because you still have to
remember like have fun night school yeah
and I'd say like senior year like I took
all these a piece and I was like kind of
after I got to college I was like why
like yeah like like it was just like
senioritis the day for most colleges and
have to get a 4 or 5 on the AP exam for
a DP transfer so if you're taking really
hard AP and you know you're not going to
get a 4 or 5 or taking
basically for nothing you don't look
senior year because like you know how
often I study
yeah okay so going off of that number
seven is but still challenge yourself so
even though I am saying like oh don't
take ones that you know you won't get
let it create score like I'm not saying
that like still take them still
challenge yourself I know people that
have like for study halls in high school
woods like a pick it up class and then
like one writing class like honestly
they come on
like challenge yourself like colleges if
you do want to go to college they want
to see that you're going to pushing
yourself I mean that's what's cool is
that you're not going to school to just
sit there like you're going to learn and
like take classes yeah so like I said I
mean you don't need to be taking every
single class and like killing yourself
but you should be challenging yourself
you know special needs college is harder
so like if you do go to college once you
get there if you like went working
harder trying in high school you're
gonna be like oh it'll be like really
hard so yeah don't you know forget it
it's like a battle yeah yeah
wait don't cycle I feel like you have to
find the right balance between like
having fun and like your social life and
like still working hard in like focusing
on your academics cuz you can definitely
have like too much of either one so yeah
okay so kind of wound up of those number
eight is don't spread yourself too thin
meaning don't try and do everything and
don't try to be the best of everything
yeah you guys have like yeah yeah
there's like two people in her like max
also yeah I think they were just
involved in everything and they were
taking like the hardest classes and like
all APs and like they were they're like
presidents like five clubs we've been
doing every single sport like possible
and like they I don't know they were
just like oh he's like half there
because they couldn't commit like all
the time that's needed like anything
really and like everything kind of
like you're not like yours Florrick
signs me that good and like yeah you're
involved in all this stuff like how much
are you really there and like like
you're like social life like just
everything kind of stuff particularly I
think colleges would rather see that
you're really involved and like pour
yourself into 102 things October 3 and
spend of like seven president eight
clubs yeah I think it's more important
to be like really into like a few things
and involved and like show your
commitment to those rather might be like
oh I like within this and this yeah yeah
don't spread yourself too thin pretty
sure okay number nine is to be nice to
your teachers and I wrote that for
recommendations yeah so you may see
teachers anyway I know some teachers are
very difficult I had some that I could
not be nice to mm-hmm but in general you
know be nice to your teachers like there
are people too and yeah maybe we'll give
you a bakery on something but like you
probably deserved it honestly before you
go to college once again if you do I
know like I've learned this to college
but if you do like you're gonna need
teacher recommendations so you do want
to kind of oi have good relationships
with your teachers I know we've seen
understanding like we were just kind of
like going to class like do the work and
get out what you want like have
relationship career teachers but if
anybody when you go to like ask for
recommendations they're probably like we
who are you
okay and then number ten our final tip
is to go to class and I thought this
might be more relevant in college or in
like senior year of high school but a
lot of people just start skipping and I
don't like basically all my friends said
that I actually didn't do that but for
me like I took a lot of ApS like senior
year so I really couldn't skip but I
know that once you skip one you're
already so behind especially especially
in math classes math classes folks it's
one day and they're like yeah you can't
believe the rest of the year you're done
you're done yeah it's so true yeah but I
don't really miss one day and then you
have like a pile of work and you miss
another day or it's just like going and
you're trying to catch up mother what
you missed but then you're missing the
work that you have to do like that yeah
and it's you know you may get yourself
in a hole so honestly like I know you
have to skip it once in a while like
yeah come on but try to go as much as
you can I know it's annoying and no one
likes school but I think that people
well okay well I think it is a slippery
slope but I you know for me I just like
got used to not go and I'd be like oh
what a hassle
yeah but also this is kind of unrelated
but I say people should go to senior
skip day because you know no one's gonna
be there and you know all the teachers
don't know what's gonna be there so then
you're there for an extra day and you're
not learning anything so like wow like
all the kids that showed up like you're
great and since there's only three
people in the class like let's go get
the doughnut
yeah like it was great my schools are
pretty really good actually
okay go that it I hope this video was
