you are new I am Tasha welcome to my
channel so today is the start of college
advice videos I did so many of these
last summer a lot of you guys probably
saw me from the comic-con below if you
did but basically I did a ton of those I
got some really positive feedback on
them so I decided to spice them up again
this summer last year I get a video what
to bring to college and this video is
going to be pretty similar to that one
except the items in this video are
things that would be more unexpected or
just the things you wouldn't think of
immediately I've been that these videos
to know that some of you guys will think
that items I mentioned in this video are
obvious or are not unexpected at all so
yes I understand that some people will
not agree with these things but for the
most part I think we can agree on these
because I am just one person with one
opinion I wanted to ask you guys for
your opinions on these items so I did
tweet on Twitter and asked you guys for
suggestions for this video and a lot of
you answered the things that I was
already going to use so that just shows
that they are good items but I will try
and put the little name on the screen of
the people who tweeted me these ideas to
give balance and credit I'm going to be
trying to link most of the things that I
mentioned in description box in case you
guys want to know where you can get them
okay so really quickly before I get into
the video if you guys are not following
me on social media and you want to I
will put my handle my Instagram handle
on the screen and I'll put all my other
social media handles in the description
box it's just a great way to keep up
with my life you want to see me at
college and what I'm doing okay the
first item is a grid up water filter if
you don't know what those are I'm going
to put a picture on the screen here it's
basically something that you put water
in and it filters it for you and then
you can pour it in your cup this is
great not only for dorm rooms but also
for apartments I live in apartment right
now but I did live in a dorm room so I
know how they both are and they're going
to be higher when you're so thirsty in
the middle of the night and you don't
want to walk down the hallway to your
shared bathroom or wherever you're
living and you just walk cold water like
that's all you want and the Brita make
sure it's clean and filtered it's not
like sketchy tap water if you're not in
discussion tap water you never know what
they have in those dorm building so a
Brita and
they're pretty inexpensive and honestly
you're going to love yourself for having
no let's because Stephanie you're going
to wake up like one of those spongebob
episode things you know I'm talking
about watch yeah so if you don't want
that to you get a Brita
okay so the next thing I feel like I
might have mentioned this in the video
last year I'm not positive about is a
mini steamer once again I will put a
photo of what it looks like here I guess
there's a lot of things you could use
instead of this like an iron or like
that wrinkle spray but personally I love
the steamer you guys don't know what
it's used for is used to get wrinkles
out of clothes I have so many clothing
items that just get super super wrinkly
and this is so easy you guys like I
don't want to mess up an iron like
Altoids rotoma on my like nobody
Hughes host this meeting scenery
weathers the water in it turn on and
then the steam comes out it's so handy
my roommates always borrow this so yeah
I really recommend it it was very
expensive I believe I got my from Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond okay so the next thing is
your plugs for me personally I'm a very
light sleeper and you will find in
college that people don't give a
and they'll be loud anyway so yeah
either that or to make s'mores or you
know whatever your plugs are great or
you know like I said if you're trying to
study in a library you don't have a
noise cancelling headphones because like
I know I don't have that your plugs are
great they all cancel out all the noise
but it's definitely very helpful okay
this next item is not really tangible
but it's a venule account this is not
sponsored by venmo but if you guys go to
my been hoist
it's basically an app where you can pay
people on kind of like PayPal I guess
but it's just everyone uses venmo in
college like everyone if you know I've
been no it's like weird yeah so
basically you know if your friend buys
you like juice you can mangle them the
money for that juice or you can request
money from people on venmo
it's obviously a lifesaver of the amount
of times that you're going to hear venmo
me or judgmental me or all the know you
and college is insane so yeah I totally
like my memo yours like set up your bank
account with
and okay the next thing I would
recommend is some silverware I don't
mean you have to go out and buy like an
entire set unless you are living and
like in a part of it or wherever but
this video is mostly catered towards
like dorm rooms and stuff so yeah I
don't need you to go and get like a ton
of silverware but just like a few like
two of each thing because there's going
to be one of those nights where you're
eating like silverware once got your
eating silverware so it's going to be
one of those nights or you're eating
cereal at like 2:00 a.m. and you go to
get soon and you realize you don't have
anything
I remember freshman year my roommate was
eating cereal with a knife
just you know China have so we're okay
the next thing is a drying rack I never
had moline and I completely regret that
because it would have saved me so much
of hanging my closing the randomest
not even a word just hanging my clothes
in weird places all over my room but for
a lot of my clothes I don't want them to
shrink and I don't want them to get all
messed up in a dryer so I won't dried up
in a dry wrap is the perfect thing to be
able to hang your clothes on for them to
dry they can be like compact and
closable so they're easy to store and
yeah supposed to be really helpful I
don't know what I've been doing okay so
I only not everyone planned on going out
in college but a lot of people do and if
you do want to go out my next
recommendation is getting a cheap pair
of oh my gosh there was so much sand and
ease with the hook I have no idea how
that got me high yeah I get a key pair
of going out shoes be they're mine
there just seems like so leather slide
on things they have sand in them so I'm
not going to hold them up too much these
are literally from like Sheehan calm
personally I recommend getting us whole
leather pair like those because they're
easier to wash off but you know white
Congress are a popular option just know
your shoes are going to get destroyed so
don't wear your favorite white sneakers
I'm just going to definitely the pair of
going out shoes you can literally go to
like Target and buy a pair of like $10
speakers or whatever and just wear those
out I totally totally recommend that you
are going to need them okay the next
thing is a bathrobe
this isn't necessarily necessary
necessarily or necessary but it's great
for living in a dorm if you guys do have
a communal style bathroom and you don't
want to walk down the hallway and like a
cowl a bathroom bathroom bathroom pop a
bathrobe is a great option I really keep
one with wiener dogs all over it I love
it
but yeah bathrobe is just great like I
said if you don't want to have to worry
about holding a towel um okay the next
item is emergency or airborne any of
those types of things basically they're
like vitamin C tablets or things you can
put in water to drink
these are lifesavers if you feel like
you're getting sick in college because
being sick in college is the worst thing
of all time it's ten times worse than
being sick at home because your mom or
dad are not there to take care of you
and it is awful and mostly hive you want
to air conditioning your dorms you're
sitting there with a fever dripping
sweat everywhere it's disgusting anyway
so along with just regular medicine you
know you know you're adding propria your
nyquil your Bakewell whatever make sure
you have emergency or something and
start taking this if you feel like
you're getting sick or just drink it
every day you know some people drink it
every day and that's pretty good for you
so yeah I would definitely recommend
that because you do not want to getting
sick in college okay the last item in
this video is a vacuum oh my gosh I
cannot tell you how many times I need a
vacuum this year I have a wooden floor
and my roommates have a dog I think a
lot of you guys think it's my dog but
it's not it's their dog and they can
only have it you because when Larry
might have anxiety so he's considered a
service dog anyways I have this like
span thing with his inventing in my room
that blows air and I swear it sucked in
the dog here into my room because most
the time I go with clothes but I somehow
still get doctor all over my rooms like
a vacuum like every single day I just
don't like having hair and dirt stuff on
my floor but even when I was in a dorm
room I had carpeting on the floor and
let me tell you my hair about all over
it my roommate was probably so disgusted
with me but you know chrome hair random
share like all over the floor you're
going to want to vacuum got so those
would be ten unexpected things that you
will meet in college if you guys have
any more recommendations
leaving
the comments because you can help out
other people in the comments and
something's up items that you agree with
speaking up thumbs up if you guys like
this video please give it a like that
would mean so much to me
